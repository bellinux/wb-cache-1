5|$|In 1983, French scholar George Wellers {{was one of}} {{the first}} to use German data on deportations to {{estimate}} the number killed at Auschwitz, arriving at <b>a</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> 1,471,595 deaths, including 1.35million Jews and 86,675 Poles. A larger study started by Franciszek Piper used timetables of train arrivals combined with deportation records to calculate at least 960,000 Jewish deaths and at least 1.1 million total deaths, a figure adopted as official by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum in the 1990s. Piper stated that <b>a</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> as many as 1.5 million total deaths was possible.|$|E

In total, Gone with the Wind has grossed over $390 million globally at the box office; in 2007 Turner Entertainment estimated the gross to be equivalent to approximately $3.3 billion when adjusted for inflation to current prices, while Guinness World Records arrived at <b>a</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> $3.44 billion in 2014, making it the most successful film in cinema history.|$|E

Thousands more drowned {{as they tried to}} get across the river. It is thus likely that {{about a third of the}} German force lost their lives. However, it appears that the majority escaped, including the eight reges alongside Chnodomar. The Romans lost just 243 men, including four tribuni (regimental commanders) of which two were commanders of cataphracti.|$|E
5|$|Arthur is {{a central}} figure in the legends making up the Matter of Britain. The legendary Arthur {{developed}} as <b>a</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn. How much of Geoffrey's Historia (completed in 1138) was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey himself, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Matilda {{directed}} {{more of her}} attention to the Cistercian order, This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, <b>a</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> particular importance to Matilda. She had close links to the Cistercian Mortemer Abbey in Normandy, and drew on the house for a supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.|$|E

5|$|Attempts to {{quantify}} {{the economic impact of}} growth in the air transport sector generate results which depend on assumptions made, and therefore the viewpoint of the organisation making the analysis. The OEF study has produced <b>a</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> £2.5billion per annum of additional GDP by 2015 for Heathrow, or £7billion per annum by 2030 if a third runway is built there. Full implementation of the White Paper runway proposals resulted in a forecast yield of an additional £13billion per annum in GDP by 2030. Calculations done for the AEF, based on a new runway at Stansted, and which assume increased taxation of the industry, result in a negative economic benefit.|$|E

The Welsh Assembly Government is aware of this, and helped by government initiatives and local actions, opportunities for farmers to diversify have emerged. These include farm tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and added-value food products.|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{the first}} openly non-heterosexual {{character}} {{in the history of}} televised Doctor Who. The popularity of the character amongst multiple audiences directly influenced the development of the spin-off series Torchwood. The character became <b>a</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> the British public consciousness, rapidly gaining fame for portrayer John Barrowman. As an ongoing depiction of bisexuality in mainstream British television, the character became a role model for young gay and bisexual people in the UK. Jack is featured in various Doctor Who and Torchwood books and has action figures created in his likeness.|$|E

At this time he also wrote an operetta Rothschild and a semi-autobiographical play called Mashiach Tzeiten (Messiah Times) that gave a less-than-optimistic view of America.|$|E
