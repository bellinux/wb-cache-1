40|$|Today, {{state-of-the-art}} III-Ns {{technology has}} been focused on the growth of c-plane nitrides by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) using a conventional two-step growth process. Here we show that the use of graphene as <b>a</b> <b>coating</b> <b>layer</b> allows the one-step growth of heteroepitaxial GaN films on sapphire in a MOCVD reactor, simplifying the GaN growth process. It is found that the graphene coating improves the wetting between GaN and sapphire, and, with as little as similar to 0. 6 nm of graphene coating, the overgrown GaN layer on sapphire becomes continuous and flat. With increasing thickness of the graphene coating, the structural and optical properties of one-step grown GaN films gradually transition towards those of GaN films grown by a conventional two-step growth method. The InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well structure grown on a GaN/graphene/sapphire heterosystem shows a high internal quantum efficiency, allowing the use of one-step grown GaN films as 'pseudo-substrates' in optoelectronic devices. The introduction of graphene as <b>a</b> <b>coating</b> <b>layer</b> provides an atomic playground for metal adatoms and simplifies the III-Ns growth process, making it potentially very useful as a means to grow other heteroepitaxial films on arbitrary substrates with lattice and thermal mismatch. close 55...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{shows that}} the laser micro-treatment of the silicon {{elements}} of solar cells with the different morphology of monocrystalline silicon, including the selective laser sintering of the front electrode to its surface using the CO 2 laser, improves the quality by minimising the resistance of a joint between the electrode and the substrate. The influence of the properties achieved for the front electrode on the electrical properties of solar cells was assessed. A front electrode of photovoltaic cells deposited by the traditional screen printing method and by co-firing in the infrared conveyor furnace was prepared for comparative purposes. Design/methodology/approach: The topography of front contacts subjected to selective laser sintering and co-firing in the infrared conveyor furnace was investigated using the scanning electron microscope with the energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectrometer for a microchemical analysis and with the confocal laser scanning microscope. Both, the surface topography and {{cross section of the}} front contacts was examined with the SEM microscope. The phase composition analyses of the selected front contacts were carried out using the XRD method. The front contacts were formed on the surface with the different morphologies of solar cells: textured ones with <b>a</b> <b>coated</b> antireflection <b>layer,</b> textured ones without <b>a</b> <b>coated</b> antireflection <b>layer,</b> non-textured ones with <b>a</b> <b>coated</b> antireflection <b>layer</b> and non-textured ones without <b>a</b> <b>coated</b> antireflection <b>layer.</b> An average size of pyramids was measured using the atomic force microscope (AFM). The resistance of the front electrodes was investigated using the Transmission Line Model (TLM). Findings: The following technological recommendations for the laser micro-treatment technology such as optimal paste composition, the power and scanning speed of the laser beam, the morphology of the silicon substrate to produce the front electrode of silicon solar cells, were selected experimentally in order to produce a uniformly melted structure, well adhering to the substrate, with the low resistance of the front electrode-to-substrate joint zone. Research limitations/implications: The contact resistance of front metallisation established depends on the paste composition, morphology of the silicon substrate as well as the co-firing and laser micro-treatment conditions. Originality/value: This paper investigates the front contact production using different silver paste compositions on silicon solar cells in order to decrease contact resistance and increase efficiency in this way...|$|R
