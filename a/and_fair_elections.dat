40|$|In {{representative}} democracy elections are of crucial importance. To {{find out whether}} an election has been free <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> the <b>election</b> must be conducted under conditions that enable the voter to cast his or her votes he or she wishes purely {{on his or her}} own choice and there must be no obstruction, harassment, hindrance, threats or intimidation. A free <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> <b>election</b> reflects an election in which all the major players compete equally and accept the outcome of the process. The fundamental benefit from a “free <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> ” <b>election</b> is that it creates a legitimate and representative government. The constitution of Bangladesh confers full political rights to women. Involving women and men in decision-making processes is a sign of sound democratic framework. Democracy, by definition, therefore cannot be gender-blind. It strives towards equality and representation of women and men in all political and decision-making processes. What is now often questioned is how {{to increase the number of}} women’s participation in free <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> <b>election</b> in democratic institutions and what are the problems and constraints for them in parliamentary and local level election, how women are obstructed to participation in free <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> <b>election</b> <b>and</b> other important political premises that is the fundamental issues...|$|R

5|$|Babangida survived an {{abortive}} coup, then postponed a promised {{return to}} democracy to 1992. Free <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> <b>elections</b> were finally held on 12 June 1993, {{the first since}} the military coup of 1983, with a presidential victory for Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola of the Social Democratic Party, who gained some 58% of the votes, defeating Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention. However, Babangida annulled the elections, leading to massive civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks. Babangida finally kept his promise to relinquish office to a civilian government, but not before appointing Ernest Shonekan head of an interim government. Babangida's regime has been considered the most corrupt, and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in Nigeria.|$|E

5|$|While in power, Rajoelina {{periodically}} {{engaged in}} ongoing negotiations to establish {{conditions under which}} free <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> <b>elections</b> could be held to restore government constitutionality and legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} the international community. On 4 August 2009 Rajoelina met with former Madagascar presidents Ravalomanana, Ratsiraka and Zafy along with former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano acting as mediator at the four-day mediation crisis talks held in Maputo, Mozambique. The Maputo Accords signed by the four leaders in August and further accords signed in Addis-Abeba in November provided guidelines for a period of consensual political transition. In the months that followed, however, Rajoelina obstructed the implementation of the accords, making unilateral political decisions and filling all important government posts with TGV party representatives.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey of}} European {{countries}} reported in Hirst v. United Kingdom (No. 2) (2005), a {{judgment of the}} European Court of Human Rights, found that 18 states allowed prisoners to vote without restriction (Albania, Azerbaijan, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine), while in 13 states all prisoners {{were not allowed to}} vote (Armenia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Kingdom). In another 13 states, the right to vote could be restricted in some way (Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Latvia and Liechtenstein). In Hirst, the UK Government's denial of the vote to prisoners was ruled contrary to Protocol 1, Article 3, of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to regular, free <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> <b>elections.</b> The European Court said that the UK had to justify any deviation from universal suffrage, but the UK Government has so far desisted from applying the judgment after the House of Commons voted on 10 February 2012 to maintain the country's blanket ban on voting by prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Apparently {{poised for}} a {{military}} victory, the rebels hesitated. Đông wanted to storm the palace and capture {{the president and his}} family. Thi felt that despite Diệm's shortcomings, he was South Vietnam's best available leader and thus was worried Diệm could be killed in an attack. Thi thought that enforced reform was the best outcome. The rebels wanted Nhu, Diệm's younger brother and chief advisor, and his wife, Madame Nhu, who were widely regarded as the powers behind Diệm's rule, out of the government, although they disagreed over whether to assassinate or deport the couple. Thi demanded that Diệm appoint an officer as Prime Minister and remove Madame Nhu from the palace. Saigon Radio broadcast a speech authorized by Thi's Revolutionary Council, claiming that Diệm was being removed for corruption and suppression of liberty. Worried by the uprising, Diệm sent representatives to negotiate. After lengthy talks, the parties agreed to a ceasefire. In the meantime, loyalist forces headed towards the capital. Diệm promised to end press censorship, liberalize the economy, and hold free <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> <b>elections.</b> Diệm refused to sack Nhu, but agreed to dissolve the cabinet and form a new government which would accommodate members of the Revolutionary Council. In the early hours of 12 November, Diệm taped a speech detailing the concessions, and Thi broadcast the message on Saigon Radio.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} community maintained that Rajoelina's legitimacy was conditional to free <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> <b>elections.</b> A {{number of key}} international organizations in which Madagascar had been a member, including the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union, withheld recognition of Rajoelina's legitimacy throughout his tenure. The United States, Madagascar's largest bilateral donor and provider of humanitarian aid, also refused to acknowledge the Rajoelina administration. The United Nations responded to the power transfer by freezing 600 million euros in planned aid. The United States suspended Madagascar {{from the list of}} beneficiaries of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which had ensured preferential tariffs for the import of Malagasy textiles. This sanction resulted in the loss of over 50,000 jobs and dealt a severe blow to the textile sector, which had accounted for half of Madagascar's exports. Rajoelina initially sought to persuade former donors to recommence their support; when these efforts failed to yield results, he explored the possibility of foregoing the support of traditional partners through new or strengthened relations with such alternatives as Libya, China and Saudi Arabia but was again unable to secure the desired partnerships.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} deteriorated {{in early}} 1993, when the teams in Arusha signed a full power sharing agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF {{and other major}} opposition parties, but excluding the CDR. This government was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until free <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> <b>elections</b> could be held. The agreement was reasonably equitable given {{the balance of power}} at the time and Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition and the RPF all accepted it; however, the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed. MRND national secretary Mathieu Ngirumpatse announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting both the president and the party's negotiators in Arusha. The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger scale killing spree than those that had previously occurred. The violence engulfed the whole northwest of Rwanda and lasted for six days, with numerous houses burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed. Paul Kagame, reacting to stories brought to him first hand by survivors seeking refuge in rebel territory, announced that he was pulling out of the Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six month cease-fire.|$|E
