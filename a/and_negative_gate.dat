40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} interest in polysilicon thin film transistors (TFTs) for high-performance applications, particularly in high-resolution displays. For these applications, the primary requirement is that the TFTs have a low threshold voltage, low and stable leakage current and reasonably high carrier mobility. The poly-Si TFTs typically have sufficiently large mobilities {{to be used for}} high-drive and moderately high-frequency applications. However, since low temperatures are used in poly-Si TFT fabrication, both semiconducting and insulating layers are of poorer quality than those used in crystalline-Si technology. Consequently, long term TFT stability is an important issue. A considerable amount of research has focused on the stability of poly-Si TFTs. The instabilities are basically associated with hot carrier injection <b>and</b> degradation, <b>negative</b> <b>gate</b> bias instability <b>and</b> gate-induced carrier injection and trapping (Young, 1996).
