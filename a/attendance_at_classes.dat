For judging subtleties of behaviors or intentions of subjects or degrees of threat, humans remain far superior at the present state of the technology. So the A.I. in security functions to broadly scan beyond human capability and to vet the data to a first level of sorting of relevance and to alert the human officer who then takes over the function of assessment and response.|$|E

40|$|In my {{experience}} engineering degree programmes are relatively demanding {{in terms of}} class contact hours which are typically up to a factor of two greater than many equivalent arts based courses. The predominant teaching strategy involves lectures and tutorials which usually take on the form of problem solving sessions and laboratory work. This commitment of time taken together with the necessary study required to complete assignments and coursework means that a consistently, steady work pattern is generally a prerequisite of success. In my role as a lecturer in engineering I have found that increasingly academic ability needs to be supplemented by motivation, effort and a structured work ethic. Furthermore, anecdotal evidence suggests that many students cannot manage their learning without significant levels of support, guidance and direction, particularly at levels 0 and 1. This may in part {{be attributed to the}} teaching methods that students have been exposed to earlier in their education which appear to be increasingly prescriptive. However, difficulties are often exacerbated by financial pressures which require an increasing proportion of the student body to undertake part-time work with unsocial working hours often disrupting <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>classes.</b> A vicious circle can ensue whereby inability to manage learning serves to de-motivate and lack of motivation in turn further reduces the ability to manage study, possibly leading ultimately to failure and/or withdrawal...|$|E

Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate overall effect sizes for weight loss and participant retention. The association between MCC characteristics and weight loss/participant retention effects was calculated using meta-regression. There was a significant small-to-medium effect of MCCs on weight loss during treatment when one outlier study was removed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{determine}} the ways in which adolescents with congenital cardiac disease believed that the condition had affected their life, and how these views were related to their perceived health. Interviews were conducted with a series of 37 adolescents, 17 girls and 20 boys, aged from 11 to 18, as they attended the clinics of 4 paediatric cardiologists in a teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. Transcripts of the interviews were analysed for recurring themes. A questionnaire was formed consisting of a set of questions for each theme, and additional items eliciting “perceived health”, and administered to a second series of 74 adolescents, 40 boys and 34 girls, who were again aged from 11 to 18 years. Slightly less than half (46 %) perceived their health as either “good” or “very good”, and one-third (33 %) rated it as “average”. The majority (66 %) felt themselves to be “the same” as, or only very slightly “different” from, their peers. The assessment of the seriousness of their condition by the adolescents, the degree to which they saw themselves as different from others, and their perceived health, were not related to the “complexity of the underlying medical condition” as rated by their physician. It was the psychosocial themes, such as exclusion from activities or the effect of the condition on relationships, that were most strongly related to the perception of their health by the adolescents.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigates the}} impact of class {{attendance}} {{and the use of}} optional formative assessment tasks on student performance. We hypothesise that a positive relationship exists between students’ attendance rates and their success on assessment tasks. We also hypothesise a positive relationship between the extent to which students use formative assessment tasks (in the form of on-line multiple choice question sets) and their success on summative assessment tasks. The question of whether attendance and the use of formative assessment have a complementary or substitutional impact on results is also investigated. The results indicate that after controlling for other factors likely to affect student performance, <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>class</b> and use of on-line formative assessment tasks do affect student performance. However, there is no further synergistic performance improvement to be achieved from both being a good attendee and a high user of the self-assessment quizzes. Further, attendance and self-assessment opportunities do not act as substitutes for each other. That is, students cannot compensate for poor attendance by making greater use of the self- assessment opportunities and vice versa...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background To {{determine}} {{factors that}} predict {{adherence to a}} mind-body intervention in a randomized trial. Design We analyzed adherence data from a 3 -arm trial involving 135 generally healthy seniors 65 – 85 years of age randomized to a 6 -month intervention consisting of: an Iyengar yoga class with home practice, an exercise class with home practice, or a wait-list control group. Outcome measures included cognitive function, mood, fatigue, anxiety, health-related quality of life, and physical measures. Adherence to the intervention was obtained by class attendance and biweekly home practice logs. Results The drop-out rate was 13 %. Among the completers of the two active interventions, average yoga class attendance was 77 % and home practice occurred 64 % of all days. Average exercise class attendance was 69 % and home exercise occurred 54 % of all days. There were no clear effects of adherence on the significant study outcomes (quality of life and physical measures). Class attendance was significantly correlated with baseline measures of depression, fatigue, and physical components of health-related quality of life. Significant differences in baseline measures were also found between study completers and drop-outs in the active interventions. Adherence {{was not related to}} age, gender, or education level. Conclusion Healthy seniors have good <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>classes</b> with a physically active intervention. Home practice takes place over half of the time. Decreased adherence to a potentially beneficial intervention has the potential to decrease the effect of the intervention in a clinical trial because subjects who might sustain the greatest benefit will receive a lower dose of the intervention and subjects with higher adherence rates may be functioning closer to maximum ability before the intervention. Strategies to maximize adherence among subjects at greater risk for low adherence will be important for future trials, especially complementary treatments requiring greater effort than simple pill-taking. </p...|$|E
40|$|Financial {{incentives}} for health have recently received increasing attention, but {{are subject to}} ethical concerns surrounding their fairness and coerciveness. Monetary Contingency Contracts (MCCs), which require individuals to deposit money, refunded contingent on reaching a goal, are a potential alternative strategy. This thesis aimed to explore the utility of MCCs {{in the treatment of}} overweight and obesity. Firstly, a review evaluated systematically the evidence for weight loss-based MCCs. Findings indicated a significant small-to-medium effect of MCCs on both weight loss and participant retention during treatment, but no significant effects post-treatment. Several intervention characteristics were associated with greater weight loss (group refunds; deposit paid in instalments; participant-set deposit size; use of additional behaviour change techniques) and greater retention (deposit paid as one lump sum; researcher-set deposit size; refunds delivered on an all or nothing basis; refunds contingent on <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>classes).</b> The findings also revealed that little evidence is available on certain types of MCCs such as those in which refunds are contingent on both the weight loss of an individual and a weight loss partner (pair-based MCCs). In studies 1 (N= 56) and 2 (N= 14), questionnaires and semi-structured interviews provided an indication of the likely engagement with and acceptability of various types of MCCs for overweight and obese individuals in the UK. In study 1, participants showed a reluctance to pay into pair-based MCCs. Study 2 suggested this stemmed from fear of lack of partner reciprocation, but that emphasising the usefulness of partner contact may encourage participation. Finally, a pilot study was conducted to explore the feasibility and efficacy of a weight loss intervention employing pair-based MCCs. Pair-based MCCs were significantly more effective in reducing adiposity (but not weight loss) compared to individual MCCs or a comparison condition. Findings will contribute to the evidence base for the feasibility and utility of administering weight loss-based MCCs in the UK...|$|E
40|$|Pilates is an {{increasingly}} popular form of exercise that {{is widely used}} both within fitness and rehabilitation. There is also a growing evidence-base for Pilates however the authors of previously conducted studies acknowledge numerous limitations which affect {{the interpretation of the}} results. Hence the need for future well-designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with appropriate target populations, details of the intervention and use of standardised and valid outcome measures. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate the scope of Pilates through systematic evaluation of current literature and current use of Pilates. This was achieved through exploring and establishing the types of clients attending Pilates classes, their rationale for <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>classes</b> and the facilitators and barriers to attending Pilates. In addition, clients' perceived effects of Pilates, the timeframe to achieve these effects {{and the ways in which}} exercises were planned and progressed in the class setting were also explored and established. This information was then related to the current literature-base to form a basis for recommendations to inform the design of high-quality RCTs. To achieve this, five novel studies were undertaken. The focus groups with Pilates instructors (n= 27) and clients attending Pilates classes (n= 25) highlighted that Pilates is a method of providing individually-modified and supervised exercises in a group setting for those self-managing long-term musculoskeletal conditions, particularly low back pain. The use of relaxation and education were also deemed to be additional facilitators to clients attending classes. A wide variety of effects were experienced by clients over the period of <b>attendance</b> <b>at</b> <b>classes</b> including reductions in pain, confidence to exercise and improvements in strength, flexibility, body awareness, posture, core stability and balance. However, numerous barriers were also expressed to practicing Pilates including cost, predominately female classes and lack of correction from the Pilates instructor when independently carrying out the exercises. The two large-scale questionnaire surveys of Pilates instructors (n= 4201797, response rate 53 %) and clients attending Pilates classes (n= 762 / 971, response rate 78. 5 %) reinforced the findings of the previous focus group studies with Pilates used as an exercise approach for improving overall general health and well-being, in terms of health maintenance and in the rehabilitation of a wide variety of medical conditions, particularly musculoskeletal disorders. A wide variety of effects were again reported with the most prevalent including improvements to posture, core stability, body awareness and sense of well-being. Clients were long-term users of Pilates and the majority reported noticing the overall effect of Pilates from 3 - 6 months. Facilitators to this long-term attendance included personal adaptation of the exercises in a small group setting and collaborative goal-setting with barriers again including cost and lack of independent practice of Pilates. The final study, a systematic review of literature (n= 38 randomised controlled trials) highlighted the potential for a number of positive effects of Pilates across a wide variety of populations particularly those with low back pain, the healthy population and a sedentary/obese population. These included reductions in pain and disability and improvements in strength, flexibility, balance, core stability, function, body composition parameters, general health, psychological effects and on hemodynamic and metabolic parameters. However, due to the numerous limitations in the studies in terms of heterogeneity of the Pilates interventions and lack of standardised outcome measures and control groups, caution must be taken when interpreting the results. In addition, many of the studies were at high risk of bias. Hence, it can be concluded that there is a need for further well-designed research trials to accurately determine the effectiveness of the Pilates method. The findings of the five studies have provided a basis for future recommendations in the design of a high quality RCT. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
