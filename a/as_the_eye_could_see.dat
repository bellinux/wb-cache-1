5|$|Akhtab {{eventually}} {{managed to}} enter and persuade them that the Muslims would surely be overwhelmed. The sight of the vast Confederate armies, surging over the land with soldiers and horses as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> swung the Qurayza opinion in the favour of the Confederacy.|$|E
2500|$|I {{looked across}} the great square, and could not believe my eyes. It was {{surrounded}} by manicured lawns, covered by flower beds on which bloomed bright red flowers. A wide street, {{which led to a}} large open area, was flanked by two rows of wooden barracks, on both sides stood rows of young trees and along the roadside ran straight flower beds as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> The square and the streets seemed freshly raked. To the left towards the watchtower, I saw a white wooden barrack and beside it a large cage, the size of a birdhouse the like you see at a zoo. Within it paraded peacocks (stolzierten) and on a climbing tree dangled monkeys and a parrot which always screamed the same word, [...] "Mama". I wondered, [...] "this is [...] a concentration camp"? ...|$|E
2500|$|In July, {{continuing}} {{south in}} clear weather, Barkley found {{the entrance to}} the Strait of Juan de Fuca. He did not explore it, but gave it its present name honouring Juan de Fuca. Juan de Fuca claimed to have discovered and sailed up a large strait at this location in 1592. Barkley thought the strait he found matched the description Juan de Fuca had given and that it was in fact Juan de Fuca's strait. The veracity of Juan de Fuca's claim had long been scoffed at by geographers and is doubted by most historians to the present day. Captain Barkley was probably the first non-indigenous person to find the strait. He was surprised to find it at all because Captain James Cook had previously explored the area and not seen it. Cook had emphatically stated that Juan de Fuca's strait did not exist. Frances Barkley wrote about the discovery in her diary: [...] "In the afternoon, to our great astonishment, we arrived off a large opening extending to the eastward, the entrance of which appeared to be about four leagues wide, and remained about that width as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> with a clear easterly horizon, which my husband immediately recognized as the long lost strait of Juan de Fuca, and to which he gave the name of the original discoverer, my husband placing it on his chart." [...] Barkley perhaps thought Tatoosh Island was the pinnacle reported by Juan de Fuca as located at {{the entrance to the}} strait. Fellow fur-trader Charles Duncan, who learned about the strait from Barkley, assumed the island was Juan de Fuca's pillar.|$|E
60|$|As {{far away}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach was a town, {{but no one}} knew its name.|$|R
6000|$|Soon, no land appeared. Far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> sweep, one azure plain; {{all over}} flaked with foamy fleeces:--a {{boundless}} flock upon a boundless mead! ...|$|R
60|$|The black clouds {{increased}} rapidly, {{until the}} whole sky was overcast. Then {{a strong wind}} sprang up and the gulf was covered with whitecaps <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach.|$|R
60|$|Beyond {{the ruins}} lay the great Ural peaks, the endless mountains, {{stretching}} out as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
60|$|The companions {{continued}} ascending {{till they}} reached a plain. It stretched as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> and was as lonely as roads across deserts.|$|E
60|$|Kurt {{led them}} through the yard, out past the old barn, {{to the edge of}} the open slope where the wheat {{stretched}} away, down and up, as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach, still <b>the</b> soft moving of {{stainless}} [...] waters proudly pure; <b>as</b> not <b>the</b> flower, so neither the thorn nor [...] the thistle could grow in those glancing fields";[15] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is your contry {{resemblance}} to dat?" [...] inquired La Roche, pointing, as he spoke, towards the sea, which {{was covered with}} fields and mountains of ice as far out <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> discern.|$|R
60|$|As we came on deck I saw to my {{surprise}} that the vessel was passing over a great field of snow and ice. As far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach in any direction naught else was visible.|$|R
60|$|A long, grey-looking {{line was}} slowly {{unwinding}} {{itself into the}} level road. It came into sight like a serpent. It reached as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> From somewhere behind, they {{heard the sound of}} music.|$|E
60|$|Every {{head was}} lifted, {{and when the}} boat rose again on a wave they could see a line of white foam ahead of them as far on either side <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> through the mist.|$|E
60|$|As we have said, as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in any direction, the {{frowning}} cliffs rose perpendicularly out of deep water. There was {{not even}} a strip of sand or a bay into which they could run in case of the wind increasing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he resumed, [...] "when I {{have done}} the like, we shall make as bonny a pair of friars <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> wish. Boldly to Sir Daniel's we shall go, and there be hospitably welcome {{for the love of}} Mother Church." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Charming age, yours,” said Mills, as we {{came out}} on the quays. Already dim figures of the workers moved in the biting dawn and the masted forms of ships were coming out dimly, <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach down <b>the</b> old harbour.|$|R
60|$|A fine pathway {{skirted the}} edge of the bank; and often we paused to admire the scenery. The evening was still and fair, even for so heavenly a climate; and all round, <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach, was <b>the</b> {{blending}} blue sky and ocean.|$|R
60|$|With {{that they}} emerged upon the harvest-field. Machines and engines dotted the golden slope, and {{wherever}} they were located stood towering straw-stacks. Horses {{and men and}} wagons were strung out as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> Long streams of chaff and dust and smoke drifted upward.|$|E
60|$|During {{the last}} hour of his walk the sun had been {{obscured}} by clouds, but, just {{as he approached the}} cliffs, the clouds separated, and a golden flood rushed over the broad Atlantic, which now lay spread out before him in all its wide majesty as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
60|$|Upon the {{following}} morning they started for the scene of action. An exclamation of surprise broke from them simultaneously when, on ascending a sandhill, they saw before them a plain a mile wide extending at their feet. It was covered with rushes and other aquatic plants, and extended south as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
60|$|To my left <b>the</b> sea {{extended}} <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach, {{before me}} only a vague, dim line indicated its further shore, while at my right a mighty river, broad, placid, and majestic, flowed between scarlet banks to empty into the quiet sea before me.|$|R
60|$|I {{live here}} in a narrow street ten feet wide only, winding up a hill, and it was full this morning of sheep as close as they could pack, at least a thousand, <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach,--tinkle tinkle, bleat bleat, {{for a quarter of}} an hour.|$|R
60|$|All at {{once the}} trees seemed to open in front, {{and in a few}} minutes the party reached the river. A cry of astonishment and of {{something}} akin to terror broke from Harold. As far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach <b>the</b> lake was frozen. Their escape was cut off.|$|R
60|$|The plain was broad, {{and as far}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> {{there seemed}} to be a level stretch of country between them and the mountain, but toward evening they came upon a hollow, in which stood a tiny blue Munchkin {{dwelling}} with a garden around it and fields of grain filling in all the rest of the hollow.|$|E
60|$|A large {{sheet of}} gray-green grass, bordered {{by the forest}} wall, as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> and dotted with low bushes, weltered in mirage; while {{stretching}} out into it, some half a mile off, a gray promontory into a green sea, was an object which filled me with more awe and admiration than anything which I {{had seen in the}} island.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a glorious}} view. On the one hand, the wood-clad hills sloped {{to the foot}} of the plain, covered with plantations, dotted here and there with the villages of the slaves, and the white houses of the overseers. At a {{distance}} could be faintly seen the towers of a city; while beyond, the sea stretched like a blue wall, far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right, Stephen," [...] said Gardiner, {{as he came}} up to this speck, {{amid the}} immensity of the white mantle that covered both sea and land, far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach; [...] "it is the cook! The poor fellow has given out here, about half-way between the two stations." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{the light}} became clearer the imminence of their peril grew more distinct. A lofty iron-bound coast rose {{in front of}} them, and {{extended}} <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach on either hand. The seas broke with terrible force against its base, sending its spray far up on the cliffs.|$|R
60|$|No {{answer was}} made to this appeal; and the invalid looked anxiously at his wife. The last sat at her work, which had now got to be less awkward to her, with her eyes bent on her needle,--her countenance rigid, and, so far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> discern, her {{feelings}} unmoved.|$|R
60|$|A week {{of travel}} brought them on June 9 to the Great Slave Lake. It was still {{early in the}} season. The rigour of winter was not yet relaxed. As far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{the surface of the}} lake {{presented}} an unbroken sheet of ice. Only along the shore had narrow lanes of open water appeared. The weather was bitterly cold, and there was no immediate prospect of the break-up of the ice.|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know how}} long we were going, and to this hour I know as little where we went. Perhaps it was near Guildford. Perhaps some Arabian-night magician, opened up the place for the day, and shut it up for ever when we came away. It was a green spot, on a hill, carpeted with soft turf. There were shady trees, and heather, and, as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> a rich landscape.|$|E
60|$|The Albertine Mountains {{had been}} disintegrated. Nothing {{remained}} but these vast clouds of debris. Below, on the ground, a ragged plain stretched out, swept by fire and ruin. Gaping wounds yawned, immense holes without bottom, craters {{side by side}} as far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> Craters and debris. Like the blasted, pitted surface of the moon. Two hours ago it had been rolling peaks and gulleys, brush and green bushes and trees.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{either side}} the plains {{stretched}} away <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach, {{in some parts}} under the plough, but far more generally carpeted with bright green grass and many-coloured wild-flowers. Everywhere could be seen droves of horses and cattle, while dotted here and there over the plain were the estancias of the proprietors.|$|R
6000|$|The account {{translated}} from the Icelandic says that the mountainlike ruins of this majestic glacier so covered <b>the</b> sea that <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach no open water was discoverable, even from the highest peaks. A monster wall or barrier of ice was built across a considerable stretch of land, too, by this strange irruption: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{morning of}} the 26th showed an ugly sight from the tall Kinsembo cliff. As far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> reach long green-black lines, fronted and {{feathered}} with frosted foam, hurried up to the war with loud merciless roars, and dashed themselves in white destruction against the reefs and rock-walls. We did not escape till the next day.|$|R
