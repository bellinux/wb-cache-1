We have reported that sepsis decreases myocardial Akt activation, which correlates with cardiac dysfunction in sepsis. We also reported that preventing sepsis induced changes in myocardial Akt activation ameliorates cardiovascular dysfunction. In this study we investigated the role of PI 3 K/Akt on cardiomyocyte function by examining the role of PI 3 K/Akt-dependent signaling on [Ca 2 +] i, Ca 2 + transients and membrane Ca 2 + current, I Ca, in cultured murine HL- 1 cardiomyocytes. LY 294002 (1 – 20 [*]μM), a specific PI 3 K inhibitor, dramatically decreased HL- 1 [Ca 2 +] i, Ca 2 + transients <b>and</b> I <b>Ca.</b> <b>We</b> also examined the effect of PI 3 K isoform specific inhibitors, i. e. α (PI 3 -kinase α inhibitor 2; 2 – 8 [*]nM); β (TGX- 221; 100 [*]nM) and γ (AS- 252424; 100 [*]nM), to determine the contribution of specific isoforms to HL- 1 [Ca 2 +] i regulation. Pharmacologic inhibition of each of the individual PI 3 K isoforms significantly decreased [Ca 2 +] i, and inhibited Ca 2 + transients. Triciribine (1 – 20 [*]μM), which inhibits AKT downstream of the PI 3 K pathway, also inhibited [Ca 2 +] i, and Ca 2 + transients <b>and</b> I <b>Ca.</b> <b>We</b> conclude that the PI 3 K/Akt pathway is required for normal maintenance of [Ca 2 +] i in HL- 1 cardiomyocytes.

40|$|The spectrin-actin {{scaffold}} {{underlying the}} lipid bilayer {{is considered to}} participate in cell-shape stabilization and {{in the organization of}} specialized membrane subdomains. These structures are dynamic and likely to undergo frequent remodelling during changes in cell shape. Proteolysis of spectrin, which occurs during apoptosis, leads to destabilization of the scaffold. It {{is also one of the}} major processes involved in membrane remodelling. Spectrins, the main components of the membrane skeleton, are the targets for two important protease systems: m- and micro-calpains (Ca 2 +-activated proteases) and caspase- 3 (activated during apoptosis). In this paper, we show that caspase- 2 also targets spectrin in vitro, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> characterize <b>Ca</b> 2 +/calmodulin-dependent regulation of spectrin cleavage by caspases. Yeast two-hybrid screening reveals that the large isoform (1 /L) of procaspase- 2 specifically binds to alphaII-spectrin, while the short isoform does not. Like caspase- 3, caspase- 2 cleaves alphaII-spectrin in vitro at residue Asp- 1185. This study emphasizes a role of executioner caspase for caspase- 2. We also demonstrated that the executioner caspase- 7 but not caspase- 6 cleaves spectrin at residue Asp- 1185 in vitro. This spectrin cleavage by caspases 2, 3 and 7 is inhibited by the Ca 2 +-dependent binding of calmodulin to spectrin. In contrast, calmodulin binding enhances spectrin cleavage by calpain at residue Tyr- 1176. These results indicate that alphaII-spectrin cleavage is highly influenced by Ca 2 + homoeostasis and calmodulin, which therefore represent potential regulators of the stability and the plasticity of the spectrin-based skeleton...|$|R
