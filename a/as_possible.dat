40|$|Abstract The {{ability to}} predict {{earthquakes}} {{is one of}} the greatest challenges for Earth Sciences. Radon has been suggested <b>as</b> one <b>possible</b> precursor, and its groundwater anomalies associated with earthquakes and water–rock interactions were proposed in several seismogenic areas worldwide <b>as</b> due to <b>possible</b> transport of radon through microfractures, or due to crustal gas fluxes along active faults. However, the use of radon <b>as</b> a <b>possible</b> earth-quake’s precursor is not clearly linked to crustal defor-mation. It is shown in this paper that uranium groundwater anomalies, which were observed in cataclastic rocks crossing the underground Gran Sasso National Laboratory, can be used <b>as</b> a <b>possible</b> strain meter in domains where continental lithosphere is subducted. Measurements evi-dence clear, sharp anomalies from July, 2008 to the end o...|$|R
