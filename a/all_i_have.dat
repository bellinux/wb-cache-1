25|$|By the way, {{would you}} convey my {{compliments}} to the purist who reads your proofs {{and tell him}} or her that I write {{in a sort of}} broken-down patois which is something like the way a Swiss-waiter talks, and that when I split an infinitive, God damn it, I split it so it will remain split, and when I interrupt the velvety smoothness of my more or less literate syntax with a few sudden words of barroom vernacular, this is done with the eyes wide open and the mind relaxed and attentive. The method may not be perfect, but it is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lopez {{stars as}} Detective Harlee Santos in NBC's crime drama series Shades of Blue (also {{serving as an}} {{executive}} producer), a single mother and police detective who goes undercover for the FBI to investigate her own squad. It premiered on January 7, 2016, giving the network its most-watched Thursday debut in seven years with 8.6 million viewers. Lopez's performance received positive reviews. Shades of Blue was renewed for a second season, which premiered in March 2017. That same month, the series was renewed for a third season. In May 2015, she announced her Las Vegas residency concert show, which commenced on January 20, 2016, the first of twenty initial dates. Titled <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Have,</b> it takes place at Planet Hollywood's The AXIS theater. The residency has been lucrative, and Lopez signed a three-year contract which will see her perform 120 shows.|$|E

Scott had previously previewed her upcoming storyline in an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, stating: [...] "I love this story! Now, I don’t know how it’s all going to turn out, but the premise, the people I get to work with, and the writing, has been spectacular. That’s all you need; good actors performing a good script, and our fabulous new directing team, and I love them <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not been this happy at work in a while." ...|$|E
500|$|During Austin's imprisonment, the {{government}} addressed several {{more of the}} convention's proposals. [...] At Santa Anna's urging, the Coahuila y Tejas legislature enacted several measures to placate the Texians. [...] In early 1834, Texas gained an additional seat in the state legislature. [...] An American immigrant was named state Attorney General, and, for the first time, foreigners were granted explicit permission to participate in retail trade. [...] Several American legal concepts, including trial by jury, were introduced to Texas, and English was authorized as a second language. [...] Finally, the state created four new municipalities in Texas: Matagorda, San Augustine, Bastrop, and San Patricio. [...] In {{a letter to a}} friend, Austin wrote [...] "Every evil complained of has been remedied. [...] This fully compensates me for <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> suffered." ...|$|E

500|$|According to BBC {{reporter}} Fernando Ravsberg, who interviewed Sánchez on Monday, November 9, 2009, {{he did not}} see bruises, marks or {{scars on}} her body. When asked, she explained, [...] "Throughout the weekend I had a swollen cheekbone and eyebrow. Above <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a lot of pain in the lower back." [...] She still had marks on her buttocks however, which she couldn't show to the reporter. She attributed that to the [...] "skill of her captors". When CNN's David Ariosto reported on the incident, after Sánchez was injured but before she met with the BBC reporter, Sánchez is shown in video footage with bruising and swelling around her left eye and bruising on her arm. [...] The video report appeared on CNN Espanol on Monday, November 9, 2009.|$|E
500|$|On November 22, 2011, the behind-the-scenes {{footage of}} the video was posted online. In the footage, her stylist said that the {{inspiration}} for the video was [...] "trailer-trash, ghetto fabulous, out-there, [...] edgy." [...] During the footage Beyoncé said [...] "I like this video. It's no choreography, no pressure. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to do is party and have a good time." [...] She also revealed that the video is supposed to reflect her simplistic childhood, adding: [...] "Growing up, I had really amazing parents and I had a great childhood. We went from nicer homes to being in apartments with our lights cutting off. It didn't matter where we were 'cause we had love and we had so much fun. It's great when you don't have as much how you improvise and you have more fun." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his last}} years, Bax {{maintained}} a contented retirement {{for much of}} the time. Walton commented, [...] "an important cricket match at Lord's would bring him hurrying up to town from his pub at Storrington with much greater excitement than a performance of one of his works". In 1950, after hearing his Third Symphony played at Bournemouth, he said, [...] "I ought perhaps to be thinking of an eighth", but by this time he had begun to drink quite heavily, which aged him rapidly and impaired his ability to concentrate on a large-scale composition. [...] He wrote in 1952, [...] "I doubt whether I shall write anything else… I have said <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say and it is of no use to repeat myself." [...] Celebrations were planned by the Hallé Orchestra and others to celebrate Bax's seventieth birthday in November 1953. The celebrations became memorials: while visiting Cork in October 1953 Bax died suddenly of heart failure. He was interred in St. Finbarr's Cemetery, Cork.|$|E

500|$|Robert Bird in his {{analysis}} of the comparison of the first cut of the film to the final Tarkovsky cut of the edited film summarized the editing process stating: [...] "The most conspicuous cuts were the most graphic shots of the stonemasons' gouged-out eyes, the burning cow, and the horse being lanced (although its horrific fall remained). Four embedded scenes of flashbacks or fantasies were also cut completely: Foma's fantasy of flight in episode two, Andrei's reminiscence of the three monks under a rain-soaked oak tree in episode four, the younger prince's fantasy of humiliating the Grand Prince in episode five, and Boriska's recollection of the bellfounding in episode seven. All in <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> counted thirty-six shots which were completely deleted in the 185-minute version of Andrei Rublev, and about eighty-five which were considerably abbreviated, including nine very long takes which are split each into two or more parts. The total number of shots went from 403 to 390, with the average shot length dropping from 31" [...] to 28". The only sequence which remained inviolable was the Epilogue in colour." ...|$|E
500|$|Walpole {{is quite}} taken by this {{tradition}} and mentions it in several letters to his friends. [...] In {{a letter to}} the Countess of Ailesbury (Lady Caroline Campbell, daughter of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll and widow of Charles Bruce, 4th Earl of Elgin and 3rd Earl of Ailesbury but by this stage married to Hon. H. S. Conway), Walpole with tongue firmly in cheek berates her for not having come to Whichnoure to claim the flitch: [...] "Are you not ashamed, Madam, never to have put in your claim? It is above a year and a day that you have been married, and I never once heard either of you mention a journey to Whichnoure." [...] Describing the location and explaining why the flitch no longer gets claimed, he writes [...] "... it is a little paradise, and the more like an antique one, as, by <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> said, the married couples seem to be driven out of it." [...] Walpole concludes, [...] "If you love a prospect, or bacon, you will certainly come hither." ...|$|E
500|$|The Allied {{disaster}} at Austerlitz significantly {{shook the}} faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both {{the war and the}} Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lunéville between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in Italy and Bavaria, and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Napoleon went on to say, [...] "The battle of Austerlitz is the finest of <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> fought". Frank McLynn suggests that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost touch with reality, and what used to be French foreign policy became a [...] "personal Napoleonic one". Vincent Cronin disagrees, stating that Napoleon was not overly ambitious for himself, [...] "he embodied the ambitions of thirty million Frenchmen".|$|E

500|$|Major {{parts of}} the song [...] "Sadda Haq" [...] were shot at the Norbulingka monastery in McLeod Ganj, Dharamsala and people waving the free Tibet flag in the {{backdrop}} were shown in the song video. This triggered a dispute between Central Board of Film Certification and Imtiaz Ali when the Board asked Ali to blur the flag before the film hit the theatre, but the director refused to do it. Imtiaz Ali said, [...] "I am not concerned at <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been out of India for long and don’t know whats going on, but I don’t see anything controversial in the intention portrayal in the movie. The purpose of the movie {{is not to make}} any social message, its more about personal freedom rather than a geographical issue." [...] However, he had to remove the sequence from the video to get the film's censor done. Later an official from the Board stated: [...] "The Censor Board chief explained to them that all the cuts were made by the director voluntarily, and he had the option of appealing to a review board which he didn’t do. There were certain discussions between (Imtiaz) Ali and the Board regarding retaining a kiss between two actors (Ranbir and Nargis), but there have been no disagreement regarding deleting the flag from the frames." [...] The controversy sparked protests among the Tibetan diaspora in Dharamsala and Chennai. Later television broadcasts blotted out a [...] "Free Tibet" [...] banner featured in the song.|$|E
500|$|On 13 February 1969, Negus and {{two others}} (Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Sir Stanford Cade) were {{presented}} with the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. This award, which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony, is presented for [...] "liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries, eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art." [...] The medal was presented by Sir Hedley Atkins, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who paid tribute to Negus: [...] "Sir Victor Negus {{is perhaps the most}} distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co-opted member. He has always been known to us as a great research worker and scientist, whose labours earned him the Lister Medal, a man of exceptional integrity and industry and a persistent advocate of the value of tradition in its best sense." [...] Atkins also paid tribute to Negus's wife, Lady Negus, who had crafted and presented to the college a tapestry of its coat-of-arms. Responding, Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921, concluding: [...] "I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done, and I feel I can now sit back and leave it to others to carry on. I {{would also like to thank}} you for inviting my wife to be here to-day; she has taken a great part in <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done." ...|$|E

This weekend {{we had a}} big party, a big YMCMB party, and Drake was {{performing}} and we were all up on the stage and Wayne got up there and he announced it himself. And so I was kind of surprised and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is awesome!'" [...] Milian is currently recording her fourth album. [...] "We're just getting started on it," [...] she said. [...] "I've already halfway gotten there and when my mom and I went to Wayne and we played him some of the music, off the second song, he was like, 'I love it. Let's do this deal.' I have some music that's already going to be on it and the second half I'm working with them now. [...] When they did a little background check, they saw even the songwriting, {{all that kind of stuff}} adds on top of, alright, she's an actress, she's a pretty face, she can actually sing, but not to mention she's a songwriter. I thought that was cool that they even saw that.
