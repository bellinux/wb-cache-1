In this paper, a variety of fluxes containing 5 % (mass fraction) organic acid activators were prepared. Effects of different activators on the spreading rates of Sn- 0. 3 Ag 0. 7 Cu solder were studied. The results show that: activity of monobasic acids are weak except for benzoic acid; dibasic acids and polybasic acids have relatively strong activity but serious corrosion and slightly less activity persistence. Compounding palmitic acid and adipic acid in the mass ratio of 1 : 2 as the activator, the <b>average</b> <b>spreading</b> rate of Sn- 0. 3 Ag 0. 7 Cu solder is 71. 11 % in maximum.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an agent-based model of financial markets with monopolistic or competitive market-makers and analyzes {{some of the}} emergent properties of these markets, including time series properties. The artificial markets we discuss utilize models of “informed ” trading agents who decide to trade based on received signals of the true or fundamental value of the stock, and “uninformed ” trading agents (sometimes called liquidity traders) who trade for exogenous reasons and are modeled as buying and selling stock randomly. These simple models of traders, combined with more complex market-making agents who function as price-setters and inventory-holders in the market, lead to a rich array of market properties, many of which qualitatively replicate properties observed in real financial markets. For example, the bid-ask spread increases in response to uncertainty about the true value of a stock, <b>average</b> <b>spreads</b> tend to be higher in more volatile markets, and market-makers with lower <b>average</b> <b>spreads</b> perform better in competitive environments. The time series data generated by our market models demonstrate phenomena like volatility clustering and the fat-tailed nature of retur...|$|R

5000|$|Emittance is a {{property}} of a charged particle beam in a particle accelerator. It {{is a measure}} for the <b>average</b> <b>spread</b> of particle coordinates in position-and-momentum phase space and has the dimension of length (e.g., meters) or length times angle (meters times radians). As a particle beam propagates along magnets and other beam-manipulating components of an accelerator, the position spread may change, {{but in a way}} that does not change the emittance. If the distribution over phase space is represented as a cloud in a plot (see figure), emittance is the area of the cloud. A more exact definition handles the fuzzy borders of the cloud and the case of a cloud that does not have an elliptical shape.|$|E
50|$|Ternary Tree Shape Plots. A {{methodology}} for plotting different tree shapes graphically {{was developed by}} Frank using ternary plot diagrams. Ternary plots {{can be used to}} graphically display any set of data that includes three terms which total to some constant. Generally this constant is 1 or 100%. This is ideal for plotting the three most commonly measured tree dimensions. The first step in the analysis is to determine what an average shape for trees is in general. These three basic parameters can be expressed as a ratio of height to girth to average crown spread. Some trees are tall and narrow, while others are low and broadly spreading. The data used to determine the average tree shape is derived from a tabulation of the largest trees of each of 192 different species in the NTS 2009 dataset. The average girth, height, and crown spread values were calculated for the measurements included in the listing. For the dataset the average height was 87.6 feet, the average girth was 100.1 inches, and the <b>average</b> <b>spread</b> was 54.9 feet. It is not critical that these values be exact for analysis purposes. The next step is to standardize each measured parameter. The quantity measured for a particular tree is divided by the standard value as determined above. The next step is to normalize the data set so that the sum of the three parameters expressed as a percentage will equal one. This enables the shapes of different trees of different sizes to be compared. The final step is to plot these results as a ternary graph to better compare the results. As an example, the measurement data for 140 live oaks measured as part of the NTS Live Oak Project were graphically plotted using this process.|$|E

40|$|The {{asynchronous}} push&pull protocol, {{a randomized}} distributed algorithm for spreading a rumour in a graph G, works as follows. Independent Poisson clocks of rate 1 {{are associated with}} the vertices of G. Initially, one vertex of G knows the rumour. Whenever the clock of a vertex x rings, it calls a random neighbour y: if x knows the rumour and y does not, then x tells y the rumour (a push operation), and if x does not know the rumour and y knows it, y tells x the rumour (a pull operation). The <b>average</b> <b>spread</b> time of G is the expected time it takes for all vertices to know the rumour, and the guaranteed spread time of G is the smallest time t such that with probability at least 1 - 1 /n, after time t all vertices know the rumour. The synchronous variant of this protocol, in which each clock rings precisely at times 1, 2, [...] ., has been studied extensively. We prove the following results for any n-vertex graph: In either version, the <b>average</b> <b>spread</b> time is at most linear even if only the pull operation is used, and the guaranteed spread time is within a logarithmic factor of the <b>average</b> <b>spread</b> time, so it is O(n n). In the asynchronous version, both the average and guaranteed spread times are Ω(n). We give examples of graphs illustrating that these bounds are best possible up to constant factors. We also prove theoretical relationships between the guaranteed spread times in the two versions. Firstly, in all graphs the guaranteed spread time in the asynchronous version is within an O(n) factor of that in the synchronous version, and this is tight. Next, we find examples of graphs whose asynchronous spread times are logarithmic, but the synchronous versions are polynomially large. Finally, we show for any graph that the ratio of the synchronous spread time to the asynchronous spread time is O(n^ 2 / 3). Comment: 25 page...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} and evaluates a market-making algorithm {{for setting}} prices in financial markets with asymmetric information, and analyzes {{the properties of}} artificial markets in which the algorithm is used. The core of our algorithm is a technique for maintaining an online probability density estimate of the underlying value of a stock. Previous theoretical work on market-making has led to price-setting equations for which solutions cannot be achieved in practice, whereas empirical work on algorithms for market-making has focused on sets of heuristics and rules that lack theoretical justification. The algorithm presented in this thesis is theoretically justified by results in finance, {{and at the same}} time flexible enough to be easily extended by incorporating modules for dealing with considerations like portfolio risk and competition from other market-makers. We analyze the performance of our algorithm experimentally in artificial markets with di#erent parameter settings and find that many reasonable real-world properties emerge. For example, the spread increases in response to uncertainty about the true value of a stock, <b>average</b> <b>spreads</b> tend to be higher in more volatile markets, and market-makers with lower <b>average</b> <b>spreads</b> perform better in environments with multiple competitive market-makers. In addition, the time series data generated by simple markets populated with market-makers using our algorithm replicate properties of real-world financial time series, such as volatility clustering and the fat-tailed nature of return distributions, without the need to specify explicit models for opinion propagation and herd behavior in the trading crowd...|$|R
