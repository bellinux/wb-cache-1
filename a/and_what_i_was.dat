I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and when that happens it's really magical to me." [...] After completing [...] "Objection (Tango)", Shakira decided to write ten more songs and began setting up portable recording studios in the rural region of Uruguay. She wrote various songs with a [...] "dictionary {{in one hand and a}} thesaurus in the other." [...] During the songwriting process, Shakira wrote [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] as a love song for de la Rúa. She explained that, [...] "If you check the subject of my songs, most of them talk about my own experiences and feelings <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> actually going through in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence, and filmed in Malibu, California, {{during the week of}} October 29, 2002. Lawrence created the video's concept and told MTV News, [...] " [...] had a conversation on the phone and all he said was he wanted to have some dancing in it, but to do my thing. He told me what the song was about, but in a [...] as well. He just said it was a kiss-off song and so I came up with this idea and he went for it". Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats. Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a voyeur and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. [...] "That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming into it with a super clean-cut image with 'N Sync and he's such a nice guy and so handsome <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> into doing was making him be a bit scary. Lurking around the house in the rain, throwing a rock through her window, being a peeping Tom, getting revenge and doing stuff that's not really what a nice guy does." [...] The music video for [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] was released onto the iTunes Store on April 28, 2003.|$|E
