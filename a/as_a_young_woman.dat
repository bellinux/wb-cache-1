In 1917, Franklin often included Mercer in his summer yachting parties, which Eleanor usually declined to attend.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman,</b> she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E

5|$|Meyer {{was born}} Selina Catherine Eaton to mother Catherine Calvert Eaton and Gordon Dunn Eaton. In her childhood, {{she loved her}} father (whom she affectionately called Daddy), but resented her narcissistic mother. It is later {{revealed}} that Selina's father was an adulterer who died {{from a heart attack}} while having sex with his secretary, and that her mother only stayed with him to provide for her. Selina attended Smith College, and Yale Law School. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman,</b> she married Andrew Meyer, a shady real estate developer, with whom she has a daughter, Catherine. She eventually divorces Andrew for repeatedly cheating on her, and shows little (if any) maternal instinct towards her daughter.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman,</b> Razafindrahety {{married an}} Andriana (nobleman) named Ratrimo (Ratrimoarivony). Her husband died {{several years later}} on May 8, 1883, aged 22, leaving Razafindrahety a {{premature}} widow. According to rumor, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony may have arranged to have Ratrimo poisoned for political reasons. The Aristocratic Revolution of 1863, which had been orchestrated by Rainilaiarivony's older brother, Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony, had replaced the absolute rule of the Andriana with a constitutional monarchy in which power was shared between an Andriana monarch and a Hova (freeman) prime minister. This arrangement was to be cemented by a political marriage between {{the prime minister and}} a ruling queen effectively selected by him. As Queen Ranavalona II neared death and the search for her successor began, Rainilaiarivony may have had Ratrimo deliberately poisoned so that Razafindrahety, the most eligible successor, would be free to marry the prime minister and succeed to the throne.|$|E

5|$|Indian actress Tabu, also {{credited}} as Tabbu, {{has appeared}} in Hindi, Telugu, English, Tamil, Malayalam and Bengali films. Tabu's first credited role came {{as a teenager in}} Dev Anand's Hum Naujawan (1985), and her first major role was in the Telugu film Coolie No. 1 (1991). In 1994, she starred in two Hindi filmsthe romance Pehla Pehla Pyar and the action drama Vijaypathand received the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for the latter. After appearing in a series of poorly received films, including Prem and Saajan Ki Baahon Mein (both 1995), the year 1996 was key for Tabu. Her performance <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> affected by the Punjab insurgency in Gulzar's Maachis (1996) proved to be a breakthrough for her, and won her the National Film Award for Best Actress. Also that year, Tabu won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu for the romance Ninne Pelladata, and featured alongside Govinda and Karisma Kapoor in the commercially successful comedy film Saajan Chale Sasural.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona III (November 22, 1861– May 23, 1917) was {{the last}} {{sovereign}} of the Kingdom of Madagascar. She ruled from July 30, 1883 to February 28, 1897 in a reign marked by ongoing and ultimately futile efforts to resist the colonial designs {{of the government of}} France. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman,</b> she was selected from among several Andriana qualified to succeed Queen Ranavalona II upon her death. Like both preceding queens, Ranavalona entered a political marriage with a member of the Hova elite named Rainilaiarivony, who in his role as Prime Minister of Madagascar, largely oversaw the day-to-day governance of the kingdom and managed its foreign affairs. Ranavalona tried to stave off colonization by strengthening trade and diplomatic relations with the United States and Great Britain throughout her reign. French attacks on coastal port towns and an assault on the capital city of Antananarivo ultimately led to the capture of the royal palace in 1895, ending the sovereignty and political autonomy of the century-old kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Slavery {{did not end}} in New York State until July 4, 1827, and, {{like many}} men of his day, Stanton's father was a slaveowner. Peter Teabout, a slave in the Cady {{household}} who was later freed in Johnstown, took care of Stanton and her sister Margaret. While she {{makes no mention of}} Teabout's position as a slave in her family's household, he is remembered with particular fondness by Stanton in her memoir, Eighty Years & More. Among other things, she reminisces about the pleasure she took in attending the Episcopal church with Teabout, where she and her sisters enjoyed sitting with him {{in the back of the}} church rather than alone in front with the white families of the congregation. It seems it was, however, not immediately the fact that her family owned at least one slave, but her exposure to the abolition movement <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> visiting her cousin, Gerrit Smith, in Peterboro, New York, that led to her staunch abolitionist sentiments.|$|E
