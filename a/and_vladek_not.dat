50|$|Spiegelman shows {{numerous}} {{instances of}} Poles who risked themselves to aid Jews, and also shows antisemitism as being rife among them. The kapos {{who run the}} camps are Poles, <b>and</b> Anja <b>and</b> <b>Vladek</b> are tricked by Polish smugglers {{into the hands of}} the Nazis. Anja <b>and</b> <b>Vladek</b> hear stories that Poles continue to drive off and even kill returning Jews after the war.|$|R
500|$|Vladek {{tells of}} his {{hardship}} in the camps, of starvation and abuse, of his resourcefulness, of avoiding the —the {{process by which}} prisoners were selected for further labor or execution. [...] Despite the danger, Anja <b>and</b> <b>Vladek</b> exchange occasional messages. [...] As the war progresses and the German front is pushed back, the prisoners are marched from Auschwitz in occupied Poland to Gross-Rosen within the Reich, and then to Dachau, where the hardships only increase <b>and</b> <b>Vladek</b> catches typhus.|$|R
500|$|The war ends, {{the camp}} {{survivors}} are freed, <b>and</b> <b>Vladek</b> <b>and</b> Anja reunite. [...] The book closes with Vladek turning {{over in his}} bed as he finishes his story and telling Art, [...] "I'm tired from talking, Richieu, and it's enough stories for now." [...] The final image is of <b>Vladek</b> <b>and</b> Anja's tombstone—Vladek died in 1982, before the book was completed.|$|R
50|$|Morcia {{is where}} Knights’ Kingdom takes place. It is {{believed}} to be a reference to the ancient English kingdom, Mercia. It is the home of the Hero Knights, King Mathias, <b>and</b> <b>Vladek.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Apple (also called Star Rock) is a 1980 American-West German musical {{science fiction}} comedy film written and {{directed}} by Menahem Golan, and starring Catherine Mary Stewart, George Gilmour, Grace Kennedy, <b>and</b> <b>Vladek</b> Sheybal.|$|R
5000|$|In 1979 the BBC aired a {{three part}} espionage thriller {{with the same}} title based on the novel, {{starring}} Stuart Wilson, Ragnheiður Steindórsdóttir, [...] George Sewell <b>and</b> <b>Vladek</b> Sheybal. It was made by BBC Scotland and largely filmed on location in Iceland. [...] Thirty years later, copies of the video were changing hands for US$1,000.00.|$|R
5000|$|Art asks after Anja's diaries, which Vladek {{tells him}} were her {{account of her}} Holocaust {{experiences}} and the only record {{of what happened to}} her after her separation from <b>Vladek</b> at Auschwitz, <b>and</b> which <b>Vladek</b> says she had wanted Art to read. Vladek comes to admit that he burned them after she killed herself. Art is enraged, <b>and</b> calls <b>Vladek</b> a [...] "murderer".|$|R
5000|$|Art {{tried to}} keep his father's story chronological, because {{otherwise}} he would [...] "never keep it straight". His mother Anja's memories are conspicuously absent from the narrative, given her suicide <b>and</b> <b>Vladek's</b> destruction of her diaries. Hirsch sees Maus in part {{as an attempt to}} reconstruct her memory. Vladek keeps her memory alive with the pictures on his desk, [...] "like a shrine", according to Mala.|$|R
50|$|Flesh + Blood was a mini-series running {{each week}} for 14 minutes within Network 7, written by Joanna Hogg <b>and</b> {{featuring}} <b>Vladek</b> Sheybal <b>and</b> Diana Quick {{in the main}} roles.|$|R
50|$|Harry <b>and</b> Margaret <b>Vladek</b> have a {{son with}} severe {{developmental}} disabilities. They are offered the chance to have his brain replaced {{with that of a}} cognitively normal child who was killed in an accident.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Greenspun was {{dissatisfied}} {{with what he}} termed the [...] "general inconsequence" [...] that the script evokes. However, Greenspun expressed that Chaplin's performance was [...] "so reticent and so appealing as to constitute a small personal triumph. She is granted the film's only moments of quiet intelligence. She fills these moments with delicate intimacy that contrasts with {{everything else in the}} film that really does suggest a reservoir of feeling to oppose the lives around her that are wasted in mere action." [...] Time magazine noted the standout performances of Donald Pleasence as the Head of British Intelligence <b>and</b> <b>Vladek</b> Sheybal as a minor agent.|$|R
50|$|Art Spiegelman {{was born}} on February 15, 1948, in Sweden to Polish Jews <b>and</b> Holocaust {{survivors}} <b>Vladek</b> <b>and</b> Anja Spiegelman. An aunt poisoned their first son Richieu to avoid capture by the Nazis four years before Spiegelman's birth. He and his parents immigrated to the United States in 1951. During his youth his mother occasionally talked about Auschwitz, but his father did {{not want him to}} know about it.|$|R
50|$|Lord Vladek: (Spring 2004-Autumn 2004, 2005-2006) He was the {{adviser to}} King Mathias, but he {{put him in}} a dungeon and claimed the King had gone missing, and that a tournament would be held to {{determine}} the new king. He entered, and planned to use the power of the Book of Morcia to win and become king. However, the four Hero Knights found Mathias <b>and</b> defeated <b>Vladek.</b> Some time after, <b>Vladek</b> fled, <b>and</b> found himself in the lost kingdom of Ankoria, where he regained power by creating the Vladmask, and took over the kingdom. It was here he adopted the title of “Lord Vladek”. He threatened to use the Vladmask to destroy Morcia, but Sir Jayko destroyed the Vladmask <b>and</b> stopped him. <b>Vladek</b> has a dark visage, with burning embers for eyes and a mouth set in a permanent grimace. When his Vladmask is not on, he can cause fear in even the most stalwart of the Hero Knights. His emblem is the scorpion, and it is set into his shield for all to know. Vladek's sword is of the darkest coal, sinister <b>and</b> deadly. <b>Vladek</b> is an oddity among the Knights’ Kingdom series kits, in that {{he is one of the}} very few figures to have only one movable arm via a dial on their back. This is supposedly because of his skill with the sword, and disdain of the shield. Vladek's sword is perfectly capable of deflecting all arms that can be brought to bear, and it is rumored he can split an arrow in mid air. Now Vladek has a new black and silver armor, red cape, and Sorcerer's Sword which is capable of deflecting boulders and creating things out of ruins.|$|R
40|$|Making use {{of trauma}} theory and Erin H. McGlothlin's {{concept of the}} third-level narration, this thesis will discuss how <b>Vladek's</b> trauma <b>and</b> its {{transmission}} to Artie are visually and narratively represented. An analysis of particularly the third level of narration in Art Spiegelman's "Maus" shows that <b>Vladek</b> <b>and</b> Artie do <b>not</b> succeed in fully working through their traumas...|$|R
50|$|In Sosnowiec, <b>Vladek</b> <b>and</b> Anja {{move from}} one hiding place to the next, making {{occasional}} contact with other Jews in hiding. Vladek disguises himself as an ethnic Pole and hunts for provisions. The couple arrange with smugglers to escape to Hungary, {{but it is a}} trick—the Gestapo arrest them on the train and take them to Auschwitz, where they are separated until after the war.|$|R

5000|$|Art Spiegelman's {{parents were}} Polish Jews [...] (1906-1982) and [...] (1912-1968) Spiegelman. His father was born Zeev Spiegelman, with the Hebrew name Zeev ben Avraham. Władysław was his Polish name, <b>and</b> Władek (or <b>Vladek</b> in Russified form) was a {{diminutive}} of this name. He was {{also known as}} Wilhelm under the German occupation, and upon immigration to the United States he took the name William. His mother was born Andzia Zylberberg, with the Hebrew name Hannah. She took the name Anna upon her immigration to the US. In Spiegelman's Maus, from which the couple are best known, Spiegelman used the spellings [...] "Vladek" [...] and [...] "Anja", which he believed would be easier for Americans to pronounce. The surname Spiegelman is German for [...] "mirror man".|$|R
5000|$|In 1943, the Nazis {{move the}} Jews of the Sosnowiec Ghetto to Srodula, and march {{them back to}} Sosnowiec to work. The family splits up—Vladek and Anja send Richieu to Zawiercie to stay with an aunt for safety. As more Jews are sent from the ghettos to Auschwitz, the aunt poisons herself, her children, and Richieu to escape the Gestapo. In Srodula, many Jews build bunkers {{to hide from the}} Germans. Vladek's bunker is {{discovered}} and he is placed into a [...] "ghetto inside the ghetto" [...] surrounded by barbed wire. The remnants of <b>Vladek</b> <b>and</b> Anja's family are taken away. Srodula is cleared of its Jews, except for a group Vladek hides with in another bunker. When the Germans depart, the group splits up and leaves the ghetto.|$|R

50|$|As an adult, Art visits his father, {{from whom}} he has become estranged. Vladek has {{remarried}} to a woman called Mala since the suicide in 1968 of Art's mother Anja. Art asks Vladek to recount his Holocaust experiences. Vladek tells {{of his time in}} the Polish city Częstochowa and how he came to marry into Anja's wealthy family in 1937 and move to Sosnowiec to become a manufacturer. <b>Vladek</b> begs Art <b>not</b> to include this in the book, and Art reluctantly agrees. Anja suffers a breakdown due to postpartum depression after giving birth to their first son Richieu, and the couple go to a sanitarium in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia for her to recover. After they return, political and antisemitic tensions build until Vladek is drafted just before the Nazi invasion. Vladek is captured at the front and forced to work as a prisoner of war. After his release, he finds Germany has annexed Sosnowiec, and he is dropped off {{on the other side of}} the border in the German protectorate. He sneaks across the border and reunites with his family.|$|R
5000|$|Vladek's English {{is broken}} in {{contrast}} with that of Art's more fluent therapist, Paul Pavel, who is also an immigrant <b>and</b> Holocaust survivor. <b>Vladek's</b> knowledge of the language helps him {{several times during the}} story, as when he uses it to meet Anja. He also uses it to befriend a Frenchman, and continues to correspond with him in English after the war. His recounting of the Holocaust, first to American soldiers, then to his son, is never in his mother tongue, and English becomes his daily language when he moves to America. His difficulty with his second language is revealed as Art writes his dialogue in broken English; when Vladek is imprisoned he tells Art, [...] "Every day we prayed ... I was very religious, and it wasn't else to do". Late in the book, Vladek talks of Dachau, saying, [...] "And here ... my troubles began", though clearly his troubles had begun long before Dachau. This unidiomatic expression was used as the subtitle of the second volume.|$|R

5000|$|Story: Lord Vladek has {{returned}} seeking {{the power of}} the Mistlands Tower, so that he can takeover Morcia. This time he has hired an army of Rogue Knights instead of his usual Shadow Knights. The Rogue Knights are led by Dracus and his lieutenant, Weapons Master Karzon. In Morcia, Jayko, now King after defeating Vladek, hears about <b>Vladek's</b> return <b>and</b> his army of rogue knights, and how he's after {{the power of the}} Mistlands Tower. After hearing this, King Jayko teams up with two newly trained knights, Sir Kentis and Sir Adric, who must help King Jayko defend the tower from Lord <b>Vladek</b> <b>and</b> his army of Rogue Knights. In the end, [...] "The Shield of Ages" [...] is reforged by the mysterious Blacksmith (who is hinted as being the first king of Morcia, Orlan), the Shield is used to imprison Lord Vladek in an orb on top of the tower, the Rogue Knights get trapped in a dungeon, and Morcia is saved. As shown in the comic, the old knights did not die. Sir Danju is once again a trainer of knights, and shown as being the trainer of Kentis and Adric.|$|R
40|$|Using Mikhail Bakhtin 2 ̆ 7 s {{theories}} of polyphony, dialogism, and heteroglossia, this thesis {{will seek to}} show that Art Spiegelman 2 ̆ 7 s Maus is an innately heteroglossic work. Through {{the use of the}} graphic novel medium, a multi-perspectival blend of visual and textual narrative, Spiegelman creates a work where various key voices are allowed to speak within the work—without any one voice being given full authority over the other. Vladek Spiegelman, for example, is given the ability to speak freely, despite his narrative’s shortcomings. Although Spiegelman shows Vladek’s perspective to be flawed and inaccurate at times, Art’s interviews with Vladek provide a perspective into the realities of the Holocaust and particularly of Auschwitz that neither he nor the broad cultural accounts could ever provide. At the same time, in his interviews, Art often challenges Vladek’s memoirs with the historical accounts that contradict his own, forcing the two to exist in conflict with each other. Simultaneously, as a character in his own work, Art, through wrestling with his own prejudices against his father, becomes a third voice within the novel, finding his own conflicts with both <b>Vladek</b> <b>and</b> with public perceptions of Holocaust survivors. Through these competing dialogues, Maus becomes a polyphonic, multi-voiced construction; rather than allowing one of these perspectives to take primacy or dominance over the others, Spiegelman avoids monologism by avoiding rote reconciliation. Spiegelman does not end by claiming one monologue to be correct; he gives each voice a platform, allowing the reader to inhabit a visual-textual Holocaust built from the personal accounts of Vladek, the troubled mind of Art, and a wide range of historical research. As a result, through all of these perspectives, as well as others, Spiegelman pursues a more truthful, dialogical depiction of the Holocaust through the narrative tapestry that these perspectives create...|$|R
