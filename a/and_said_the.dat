5|$|Franciscan Andrés de Avendaño left Mérida on 13 December 1695, {{and arrived}} in Nojpetén around 14 January 1696, {{accompanied}} by four companions. The Franciscans baptised over 300 Itza children {{over the following}} four days. Avendaño tried to convince Kan Ek' to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish Crown, without success. The king of the Itza, cited Itza prophecy <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> time was not yet right. Kan Ek' learnt of a plot by the Kowoj and their allies to ambush and kill the Franciscans, and the Itza king advised them to return to Mérida via Tipuj.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Isenhour and Rooney {{met with}} MSNBC news {{commentator}} Chris Matthews {{to discuss the}} possibility of Matthews running against Republican U.S. Senator Arlen Specter, although he ultimately did not run. Also that year, Isenhour and her Republican counterpart Luke Bernstein, {{executive director of the}} Republican Party of Pennsylvania, together taught a class about presidential elections at the Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Isenhour and Bernstein both believed it was the first class of its type, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> two had a very cordial relationship despite representing opposite political parties. Isenhour also taught about electoral politics at other educational institutions, including the University of Pennsylvania, Central Penn College and The Washington Center.|$|E
5|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} in The Videophile newsletter, Muntz revealed {{the biggest problem}} for the Stereo-Pak business was returned merchandise. He explained that when reproducing the work of major artists like The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant had to make {{hundreds of thousands of}} cartridges. But once a popular album became less popular, retailers would return the unsold cartridges, expecting credit towards new titles. Muntz was unprepared for the returns <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak business unprofitable.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 2012, the U.S. {{diplomatic}} mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, {{resulting in the}} deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S. On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.|$|E
5|$|The {{new series}} {{was offered a}} place {{on a number of}} {{television}} networks, with CTV and CBC (the franchise's former network) vying as the top contenders. CTV won through, offering $10million for a fifteen-episode season. The project was greenlit in May 2000, with the originally planned reunion episode serving as the pilot to the new series. CTV announced the new series at its annual press conference in June 2001, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> pilot would air in the fall.|$|E
5|$|The teaser {{poster of}} Kaminey was {{received}} positively by critics. The trailer, which introduces four characters; one lisping, one stuttering, a woman yelling about having raped {{a man and}} one jeering at the lisper, received positive reviews. Critics kept their expectations high due to Bhardwaj's previous films, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> trailer was like a comic book which introduces the characters of Kapoor and Chopra differently. The theatrical trailers and the music generated interest for the film. The film's marketing also involved public appearances by Chopra and Kapoor.|$|E

5|$|At 09:35 September 2, {{while the}} North Koreans were {{attempting}} to destroy the engineer troops at {{the southern edge of}} Yongsan and clear the road to Miryang, Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker spoke by telephone with Major General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command in Tokyo. He described the situation around the Perimeter <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> most serious threat was along the boundary between the US 2nd and US 25th Infantry Divisions. He described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them. He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, under Brigadier General Edward A. Craig, toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them, since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command. Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them. Hickey replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the US Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary. A few hours after this conversation, at 13:15, Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a co-ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the marines, with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and restoring the river line. The marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of 1 May 1991, four Croatian policemen entered Borovo Selo in an {{unauthorised}} attempt to replace a Yugoslav flag in the village with a Croatian one. The attempt resulted in an armed clash. Two of the policemen were wounded and taken prisoner, {{and the other two}} fled after sustaining minor injuries (one a wounded foot and the other a grazing wound to the head). According to the Croatian Ministry of the Interior, the police had been patrolling the Dalj–Borovo Selo road {{at the time of the}} incident. Even though the officers were assigned to the Osijek police administration, the Vinkovci police administrationwhich was assigned authority over the Vukovar municipalityasked the Vukovar police station to contact Šoškoćanin about the incident. Vukovar police contacted him at 4:30a.m., but Šoškoćanin reportedly said he knew nothing. At 9:00a.m., Vinkovci police chief Josip Džaja telephoned Šoškoćanin and received the same answer. When Reihl-Kir contacted Šoškoćanin half an hour later, the latter confirmed the incident <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> police had shot at members of the local population, wounding one. Reihl-Kir failed to secure the release of the two captured officers.|$|E
5|$|Franciscan Andrés de Avendaño left Mérida on 13 December 1695, {{and arrived}} in Nojpetén around 14 January 1696, {{accompanied}} by four companions. From Chuntuki they followed an Indian trail that led them past {{the source of}} the San Pedro River and across steep karst hills to a watering hole by some ruins. From there they followed the small Acté River to a Chak'an Itza town called Saklemakal. They arrived at the western end of Lake Petén Itzá to an enthusiastic welcome by the local Itza. The following day, the current Aj Kan Ek' travelled across the lake with eighty canoes to greet the visitors at the Chak'an Itza port town of Nich, on the west shore of Lake Petén Itza. The Franciscans returned to Nojpetén with Kan Ek' and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days.

5|$|His first {{television}} appearance {{was in a}} debate {{about the existence of}} flying saucers following a spate of reported sightings in the 1950s; Moore argued against Lord Dowding and other UFO proponents. He was invited to present a live astronomy programme <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> greatest difficulty was finding an appropriate theme tune; the opening of Jean Sibelius's Pelléas et Mélisande was chosen and used throughout the programme's existence. The programme was originally named Star Map before The Sky at Night was chosen in the Radio Times. On 24 April 1957, at 10:30 pm, Moore presented the first episode about the Comet Arend–Roland. The programme was pitched to casual viewers up to professional astronomers, in a format which remained consistent from its inception. Moore presented every monthly episode except for one in July 2004 when he suffered a near-fatal bout of food poisoning caused by eating a contaminated goose egg and was replaced for that episode by Chris Lintott. Moore appears in the Guinness World Records book as the world's longest-serving TV presenter having presented the programme since 1957. From 2004 to 2012, the programme was broadcast from Moore's home, when arthritis prevented him from travelling to the studios. Over the years he received many lucrative offers to take his programme onto other networks, but rejected them because he held a 'gentlemen's agreement' with the BBC.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, provincial government-appointed {{auditors}} {{backed up}} claims by Ocean Choice International (OCI) {{that they were}} losing millions of dollars each year operating the Marystown fish plant. On December 2, 2011, the company announced that they would permanently close their Marystown and Port Union fish processing plants and invest money into other plants throughout the province. The following week OCI asked the provincial government for an exemption to export unprocessed fish in return for nearly doubling the workforce at the company's plant in Fortune. Minister King reacted positively to the proposed idea <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> government would consider it. Negotiations on a deal would become tense, with the minister criticizing the company for using 'pressure tactics' {{to try to get}} a deal. OCI said that they were in damage control all around the world because of Minister King's comments. In February 2012, the government rejected a proposal to drop MPRs for the company, saying that it was not in the best interest of the province. In mid October 2012, workers at the Fortune fish plant voted unanimously in favour of allowing OCI to ship out raw fish to China for processing, in return for 110 full-time jobs at their plant. The FFAW, which represented the workers, opposed the move to ship out the raw product. Dunderdale held a cabinet shuffle on October 19, 2012, and appointed Tourism Minister Derrick Dalley as the new Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. In a news conference held on December 21, 2012, Minister Dalley announced the government would allow Ocean Choice International to ship 75 per cent of its yellowtail flounder quota overseas for processing, along with 100 per cent of its redfish quota. In return a total of 236 year-round jobs, between the Fortune fish plant and on company vessels at sea, for at least five years.|$|E
5|$|In Radovich v. National Football League, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Radovich's favor and {{declared}} the NFL {{was subject to}} antitrust laws, and the implication was that {{the legality of the}} draft and reserve clause were dubious. Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business. He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling. The House Judiciary committee, chaired by Emanuel Celler—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision. Red Grange and Bell testified at the committee's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport's success. Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed as if Congress was going to accept their position. Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives.|$|E

5|$|Levy {{was last}} seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report {{that they had not}} heard from their {{daughter}} in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been {{having an affair with a}} U.S. congressman, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy's aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.|$|E

5|$|On February 12, 2007, Bennett {{proposed}} using {{tax money}} to pay for a new $500 million arena in Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. After failing to reach a deal {{by the end of the}} legislative session, Bennett gave up his attempt in April 2007. On November 2, 2007 the team announced it would move to Oklahoma City as soon as it could get out of its Key Arena lease. Seattle's mayor, Greg Nickels, maintained a stance that the Sonics were expected to stay in Seattle until their lease expired in 2010 <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> city did not intend to make it easy for Bennett to move the team early. Over concerns the city would accept a buyout of the lease, a grassroots group filed a citywide initiative that sought to prevent the city from accepting such an offer from Bennett's group. The Seattle City Council later unanimously passed an ordinance modeled after the initiative.|$|E

5|$|The {{completion}} {{date for the}} two tunnels was estimated at late 1987. WMATA engineers also inspected the mothballed Waterfront Station and {{found it to be}} still structurally sound (although water needed to be pumped from the station). However, some repairs to the tunnel between L'Enfant Plaza and Waterfront needed to be made. Construction of the tunnel from Waterfront to Navy Yard was set to begin in September 1985, construction of the Navy Yard station in early 1986, and linkage with the Anacostia River tunnels shortly thereafter. The two new Green Line stations were expected to open in 1990. In October 1985, WMATA awarded the $24.9 million contract to excavate the tunnel between the Waterfront and Navy Yard stations to Harrison Western Corp. WMATA's board awarded a $41.5 million contract for the construction of the Anacostia Station to Kiewit Construction Co. in June 1985, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> station would open in 1990. Ground was broken at the site on September 21, 1985.|$|E
5|$|Unknown to the Franciscans, the {{northern}} Chak'an Itza {{province of the}} Itza kingdom was allied with the Kowoj and was {{at war with the}} Itza king. The Chak'an Itzas carried off most of the gifts that the Spanish party had brought for the Itza king, in an effort to hinder friendly relations developing. The following day, the current Aj Kan Ek' travelled across the lake with eighty canoes to greet the visitors at the Chak'an Itza port town of Nich, on the west shore of Lake Petén Itza. The Franciscans returned to Nojpetén with Kan Ek' and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. Avendaño tried to convince Kan Ek' to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish crown, without success. The Franciscan friar tried to convince the Itza king that the K'atun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year Maya calendrical cycle beginning in 1696 or 1697, was the right time for the Itza to finally embrace Christianity and to accept the king of Spain as overlord. The king of the Itza, like his forebear, cited Itza prophecy <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> time was not yet right. He asked the Spanish to return in four months, at which time the Itza would convert and swear fealty to the King of Spain.|$|E
