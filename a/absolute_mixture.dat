40|$|A {{review of}} some of the recent {{theories}} of steady state flame propagation in gaseous mixtures reveals a considerable difference in their prediction of the effect of pressure on burning velocity. Furthermore, the experimental data obtained by various workers in the field indicate widely different trends. In some cases burning velocity appears to be independent of pressure whereas in other cases it appears to increase as the pressure is reduced below atmospheric. Hence, as a possible aid in discovering more about the mechanism of flame propagation, the burning velocity of several gaseous mixtures was studied over the general pressure range from 100 to 700 mm Hg <b>absolute.</b> The <b>mixtures</b> used were acetylene-oxygen, acetylene-air, acetylene-oxygen-nitrogen, ammonia-oxygen, ammonia-oxygen-nitrogen, carbon monoxide-oxygen, carbon monoxide-air, and propane-air. Using the burner-visual cone-area method with burners of various sizes, the following results were obtained: for all the above mixtures, except propane-air, the burning velocity is independent of pressure; for propane-air mixtures, the burning velocity varies as P[superscript -. 13]. These results are valid provided the burner size is large enough to nullify the effect of quenching. It is concluded that these results definitely do not support the Tanford and Pease theory that burning velocity varies as P[superscript -. 25]...|$|R

In Section III the problem is formulated and approximate solutions are given for hydrocarbon-oxygen flames, assuming a second order rate-controlling step. Approximate analytic solutions have been obtained for all mixture ratios. Hydrocarbon-oxygen-inert gas mixtures are considered in Section IV. A second order rate-controlling step is again assumed and solutions are given for various initial gas compositions. An attempt is made to correlate experimentally determined burning velocity data in Section V. Reference to Section V shows that a good correlation was obtained only for lean <b>mixtures.</b> <b>Absolute</b> values for the laminar burning velocity cannot be estimated {{because of the lack}} of data concerning reaction mechanism and specific reaction rate constants...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of closing seals in coal mines. After several {{accidents}} in Sago, Darby and other mines in the USA the explosion destructed the seals completely. This raised a question of what resistance is necessary for their construction. I would like to express my opinion that the request of federal safety regulation to achieve the resistance of seal of 20 pounds per square inch, which corresponds to the European 0, 138 MPa (MegaPascal) is dangerous. If the temperature in the area before explosion is for example 15 °C, then after the explosion it can reach up to 2 650 °C. After recalculation the <b>absolute</b> temperature of <b>mixture</b> before and after the explosion can be 288 K to 2 923 K. Gases then increase during explosion in volume more than 10 times. According to Mariott law, the original pressure of 0. 1 MPa must increase 10 times as much, up to 1 MPa. The seals should be designed, as the prevailing opinions claim, to this pressure value. Příspěvek se zabývá problémem uzavíracích hrázi v hlubinných uhelných dolech. Po haváriích na Dole Sago a Darby v USA, byly výbuchem tyto hráze rozmetány. To vyvolalo otázku, jaký odpor je nutný k jejich dimenzování. Předem bych chtěl vyslovit názor, že požadavek bezpečnostních federálních předpisů v USA, aby hráze byly konstruovány na odpor 20 psi (tj. 0, 138 MPa) je nebezpečný. Pokud je v uzavřené oblasti teplota například 15 °C, pak po výbuchu může dosáhnout 2 650 °C. Po přepočtu to je z 288 K na 2 923 K. Podle Mariottova zákona tak musí původní tlak 0, 1 MPa vzrůst přibližně l 0 x, tj. na 1 MPa. A na tento tlak by měly být, podle dosavadních převládajících názorů, hráze dimenzovány...|$|R
