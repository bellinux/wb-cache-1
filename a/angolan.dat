5|$|During the First Congo War, the <b>Angolan</b> {{government}} {{joined the}} coalition to overthrow Mobutu's government {{due to his}} support for UNITA. Mobutu's government fell to the opposition coalition on 16 May 1997. The <b>Angolan</b> government chose to act primarily through Katangese gendarmes called the Tigres, which were proxy groups formed from the descendents of police units who had been exiled from Zaire and thus were fighting {{for a return to}} their homeland. Luanda did also deploy regular troops. In early October 1997, Angola invaded the Republic of the Congo during its civil war, and helped Sassou Nguesso's rebels overthrow the government of Pascal Lissouba. Lissouba's government had allowed UNITA the use of cities in the Republic of Congo in order to circumvent sanctions. Between 11–12 October 1997, <b>Angolan</b> air force fighter jets conducted a number of air strikes on government positions within Brazzaville. On 16 October 1997 rebel militia supported by tanks and a force of 1,000 <b>Angolan</b> troops cemented their control of Brazzaville forcing Lisouba to flee. <b>Angolan</b> troops remained in the country fighting militia forces loyal to Lissouba engaged in a guerrilla war against the new government.|$|E
5|$|The {{turmoil of}} the Congo Crisis destabilised Central Africa {{and helped to}} ignite the Portuguese Colonial War, {{especially}} the war of independence in neighbouring Angola. <b>Angolan</b> nationalists had long had close ties with the Congo where many had lived as exiles. The União dos Povos de Angola (UPA), an <b>Angolan</b> nationalist organisation which drew support from the <b>Angolan</b> Bakongo, was supported ABAKO politicians who had hopes of rebuilding the Kingdom of Kongo, altering the borders established during the colonial period. Believing that the independence of Congo was the first stage in this process, the UPA launched the Baixa de Cassanje revolt in 1961, igniting the conflict in Angola that would last until 1974. The Congolese, later Zairian, governments continued to provide support to <b>Angolan</b> rebels and even participated directly in the subsequent <b>Angolan</b> Civil War.|$|E

2500|$|On February 4, 1961, using arms largely {{captured}} from Portuguese {{soldiers and}} police 250 MPLA guerrillas attacked the São Paulo fortress prison and police headquarters in Luanda {{in an attempt}} to free what it termed 'political prisoners'. [...] The attack was unsuccessful, and no prisoners were released, but seven Portuguese policemen and forty <b>Angolans</b> were killed, mostly MPLA insurgents. [...] Portuguese authorities responded with a sweeping counterinsurgency response in which over 5,000 <b>Angolans</b> were arrested, and a Portuguese mob raided the musseques (shanty towns) of Luanda, killing several dozen <b>Angolans</b> in the process.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Angolan</b> Civil War was notable {{due to the}} {{combination}} of Angola's violent internal dynamics and massive foreign intervention. The war became a Cold War struggle, as both the Soviet Union and the United States, along with their respective allies, provided significant military assistance to parties in the conflict. Moreover, the <b>Angolan</b> conflict became closely intertwined with the Second Congo War in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, {{as well as with}} the South African Border War.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{in order}} to enhance MPLA's combat capacity, Romania sent 150 flight {{instructors}} and other aviation personnel, who contributed to the establishment of an <b>Angolan</b> Military Aviation School.|$|E
5|$|By November 1987, Castro began {{spending}} {{more time on the}} <b>Angolan</b> Civil War, in which the Marxists had fallen into retreat. <b>Angolan</b> President José Eduardo dos Santos successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing that he was abandoning the plight of the world's poor in favor of détente.|$|E
50|$|The {{accumulation}} of small incidents began to strain {{the relationship between}} Cuba and Angola: Cuban forces were {{to be seen as}} the saviors of Angola and were given special privileges over <b>Angolans.</b> Privileges which the Cubans appear to have abused. Any minor dispute would normally be resolved in favour of the Cubans, and a growing sense that <b>Angolans</b> were second class citizens in their own country raised resentment. After all the <b>Angolans</b> originally fought to gain liberation from the Portuguese colonials only to be subjected to a Cuban system of discrimination.|$|R

5|$|Days {{before the}} coup, fellow Lusophone country Angola {{announced}} its forces would be ending the two-year-old <b>Angolan</b> Military Mission in Guinea Bissau (MISSANG) that followed a similar failed {{effort by the}} European Union {{as part of the}} United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS). State-owned <b>Angolan</b> news agency ANGOP said that the <b>Angolan</b> troops were sent to Guinea-Bissau in March 2011 in accordance with a bilateral military agreement to reform the armed forces. On 16 April, Guinea-Bissau Defense Minister Jorge Tolentino Araújo was scheduled to arrive in Angola to meet his counterpart Cândido Pereira dos Santos Van-Dúnem and the Army Chief-of-Staff Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda. He was also expected to visit the Higher Warfare School (ESG) and the Higher Technical Military Institute (ISTM). The same day as the coup, the two Lusophone countries of Angola and Cape Verde agreed to review their defense cooperation agreements. Presidential candidate and former Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Júnior was also unpopular with the army for his attempts to reform the institution.|$|E
5|$|Government troops {{captured}} and destroyed UNITA's Epongoloko base in Benguela province and Mufumbo base in Cuanza Sul in October 2001. The Slovak government sold fighter jets to the <b>Angolan</b> government in 2001 {{in violation of}} the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.|$|E
5|$|Human Rights Watch {{estimates}} UNITA and {{the government}} employed more than 6,000 and 3,000 child soldiers, respectively, some forcibly impressed, during the war. Additionally, human rights analysts found that between 5,000 and 8,000 underage girls were married to UNITA militants. Some girls were ordered to go and forage for food {{to provide for the}} troops – the girls were denied food if they did not bring back enough to satisfy their commander. After victories, UNITA commanders would be rewarded with women, who were often then sexually abused. The <b>Angolan</b> government and UN agencies identified 190 child soldiers in the <b>Angolan</b> army, and had relocated 70 of them by November 2002, but the government continued to knowingly employ other underage soldiers.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese government's {{main goal}} in {{negotiations}} was preventing the mass emigration of white <b>Angolans.</b> Paradoxically, the agreement only allowed the MPLA, FNLA, and UNITA to nominate candidates {{to the first}} assembly elections, deliberately disenfranchising Bakongo, Cabindans, and whites. The Portuguese reasoned that white <b>Angolans</b> would have to join the separatist movements and the separatists would have to moderate their platforms to expand their political bases.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the 1990s, Cabindan rebels {{kidnapped and}} ransomed off foreign oil workers to in turn finance further {{attacks against the}} {{national}} government. FLEC militants stopped buses, forcing Chevron Oil workers out, and setting fire to the buses on 27 March and 23 April 1992. A large-scale battle took place between FLEC and police in Malongo on 14 May in which 25 mortar rounds accidentally hit a nearby Chevron compound. The government, fearing {{the loss of their}} prime source of revenue, began to negotiate with representatives from Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda-Renewal (FLEC-R), Armed Forces of Cabinda (FLEC-FAC), and the Democratic Front of Cabinda (FDC) in 1995. Patronage and bribery failed to assuage the anger of FLEC-R and FLEC-FAC and negotiations ended. In February 1997, FLEC-FAC kidnapped two Inwangsa SDN-timber company employees, killing one and releasing the other after receiving a $400,000 ransom. FLEC-FLAC kidnapped eleven people in April 1998, nine Angolans and two Portuguese, released for a $500,000 ransom. FLEC-R kidnapped five Byansol-oil engineering employees, two Frenchman, two Portuguese, and an <b>Angolan,</b> in March 1999. While militants released the <b>Angolan,</b> the government complicated the situation by promising the rebel leadership $12.5million for the hostages. When António Bento Bembe, the President of FLEC-R, showed up, the <b>Angolan</b> army arrested him and his bodyguards. The <b>Angolan</b> army later forcibly freed the other hostages on 7 July. By {{the end of the year}} the government had arrested the leadership of all three rebel organizations.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Angolan</b> War of Independence of 1975, the Soviet Union's role in Third World {{politics}} increased dramatically. Some of {{the regions}} were important for national security, while other regions {{were important to}} the expansion of Soviet socialism to other countries. According to an anonymous Soviet writer, the national liberation struggle was the cornerstone of Soviet ideology, and therefore became a cornerstone for Soviet diplomatic activity in the Third World.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the Protestant churches directly generated by the missions and continuing in {{a more or less}} orthodox pattern, there were other groups, which stemmed at least in part from the Protestant experience but expressed a peculiarly local tendency and which were dominated entirely by Africans. The number of <b>Angolans</b> identifying with such African churches is not known, but {{it is reasonable to assume}} that many <b>Angolans</b> were attached to them.|$|R
5|$|Also in {{collaboration}} with Foccart, Houphouët-Boigny {{took part in the}} attempted coup of 16 January 1977 led by famed French mercenary Bob Denard against the revolutionary regime of Mathieu Kérékou in Dahomey. Houphouët-Boigny, in order to fight against the Marxists in power in Angola, also lent his support to Jonas Savimbi's UNITA party, whose feud with the MPLA party led to the <b>Angolan</b> Civil War.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the Portuguese Air Force sent 25 {{of their}} {{remaining}} F-84G to Angola. There they formed the Esquadra 91 (91st Squadron), based at Luanda Air Base.

5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the Soviets started to assert {{themselves}} in several new theaters of action, in particular through Cuban proxies during the <b>Angolan</b> Civil War starting in 1975 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. U.S. strategy to this point had been focused on containing Communism and preparation for war in Europe. The new Soviet actions revealed that the military lacked capability outside these narrow confines.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, the Portuguese {{presence}} on the <b>Angolan</b> coast remained limited {{for much of the}} colonial period. The degree of real colonial settlement was minor, and, with few exceptions, the Portuguese did not interfere by means other than commercial in the social and political dynamics of the native peoples. There was no real delimitation of territory; Angola, to all intents and purposes, did not yet exist.|$|E
5|$|Savimbi, {{unwilling to}} {{personally}} sign an accord, had former UNITA Secretary General Eugenio Manuvakola represent UNITA in his place. Manuvakola and <b>Angolan</b> Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura signed the Lusaka Protocol in Lusaka, Zambia on 31 October 1994, agreeing to integrate and disarm UNITA. Both sides signed a ceasefire {{as part of}} the protocol on 20 November. Under the agreement the government and UNITA would cease fire and demobilize. 5,500 UNITA members, including 180 militants, would join the <b>Angolan</b> national police, 1,200 UNITA members, including 40 militants, would join the rapid reaction police force, and UNITA generals would become officers in the <b>Angolan</b> Armed Forces. Foreign mercenaries would return to their home countries and all parties would stop acquiring foreign arms. The agreement gave UNITA politicians homes and a headquarters. The government agreed to appoint UNITA members to head the Mines, Commerce, Health, and Tourism ministries, in addition to seven deputy ministers, ambassadors, the governorships of Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango, deputy governors, municipal administrators, deputy administrators, and commune administrators. The government would release all prisoners and give amnesty to all militants involved in the civil war. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and South African President Nelson Mandela met in Lusaka on 15 November 1994 to boost support symbolically for the protocol. Mugabe and Mandela both said {{they would be willing to}} meet with Savimbi and Mandela asked him to come to South Africa, but Savimbi did not come. The agreement created a joint commission, consisting of officials from the <b>Angolan</b> government, UNITA, and the UN with the governments of Portugal, the United States, and Russia observing, to oversee its implementation. Violations of the protocol's provisions would be discussed and reviewed by the commission. The protocol's provisions, integrating UNITA into the military, a ceasefire, and a coalition government, were similar to those of the Alvor Agreement that granted Angola independence from Portugal in 1975. Many of the same environmental problems, mutual distrust between UNITA and the MPLA, loose international oversight, the importation of foreign arms, and an overemphasis on maintaining the balance of power, led to the collapse of the protocol.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Angolan</b> {{military}} launched Operation Restore, {{a massive}} offensive, in September 1999, recapturing N'harea, Mungo and Andulo and Bailundo, {{the site of}} Savimbi's headquarters just one year before. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 1268 on 15 October, instructing United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to update the Security Council {{to the situation in}} Angola every three months. Dos Santos offered an amnesty to UNITA militants on 11 November. By December, Chief of Staff General João de Matos said the <b>Angolan</b> Armed Forces had destroyed 80% of UNITA's militant wing and captured 15,000tons of military equipment. Following the dissolution of the coalition government, Savimbi retreated to his historical base in Moxico and prepared for battle. In order to isolate UNITA, the government forced civilians in countryside areas subject to UNITA influence to relocate to major cities. The strategy was successful isolating in UNITA but had adverse humanitarian consequences.|$|E
