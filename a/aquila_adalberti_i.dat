No {{significant differences between the}} sexes were detected in maximum dispersal distance, but females spent more time in the more distant settling areas. Dispersal distance was not related to the date of departure from the natal population. Dispersal distance was significantly longer for birds that hatched earlier and that had lower blood urea levels, indicating that better-nourished young had longer displacements.

40|$|We {{present an}} individual-based model dealing with mating {{as a process}} of pair formation. Model simulations, based on data from a 19 -year study of Spanish {{imperial}} eagles, <b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti,</b> showed that the mating pattern of a population is not necessarily a direct consequence of the mating preferences of individuals; positive age-assortative mating, by which individuals of similar age are more likely to become paired, does not necessarily indicate homotypic mating preferences. For example, individuals of similar, young age may be constrained to a few low-quality territories, leading to passive assortative mating, independent of individual preferences. Confounding factors such as territory quality can affect the encounters between a male and a female available for mating, generating an age-assortative mating totally independent of mate preferences. Such a process may apply to many territorial species when spatial variation in territory quality is pronounced. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|We {{documented}} a density-dependent age {{of first}} reproduction using {{a population of}} Spanish Imperial Eagles (<b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti)</b> in Doñana National Park (southwestern Spain). Then, a stochastic individual-based simulation was designed, to analyze the effect of variations {{in the age of}} first reproduction on the fluctuation of small populations. This is a discrete-time simulation model that uses the age structure, mortality rates, reproductive rate, and density-dependent relationships from empirical studies. Age of breeding in the real population was positively related to population density. The probability of persistence of simulated populations was affected by both breeding population ceiling and age of first breeding. Our simulations were compared to the historical evolution of the Doñana population, assuming an age of first reproduction of three years. Density-dependent variation in age of first breeding increased the mean time of persistence, allowing the population to stay at carrying capacity longer. This buffer mechanism could be crucial for the persistence of small populations. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|THE European {{wild rabbit}} (Oryctolagus cuniculus) {{is one of}} the most {{important}} vertebrate prey species in Spanish Mediterranean ecosystems, and several predator species threatened with extinction, including the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardina) and the imperial eagle (<b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti),</b> depend on high-density populations of rabbits (Delibes and Hiraldo 1981).

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al International {{symposium}} on lead poisoning, celebrado el 28 de septiembre de 2015 en Annecy (Francia). Birds of prey, especially obligatory and occasional scavengers, {{are at high}} risk of lead poisoning when they feed on carcasses or prey with embedded lead ammunition in their flesh. Although in many cases, the lead shot or bullet fragments are regurgitated with undigested material such as hair and feathers in the form of pellets, the absorption of lead during food digestion can be enough to kill the raptors. Cases of lead poisoning by shot or bullet ingestion have been described in at least 14 species of diurnal birds of prey and three species of nocturnal raptors in Europe, some of which have endangered or near-threatened populations, such as the White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), the Spanish Imperial Eagle (<b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti)</b> or the Bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus).

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{variability in}} growth of Red Kite (Milvus milvus) chicks using biometrical measures and urea and alkaline phosphatase blood levels. We used variables estimating relative mass and tarsus length growth rates during the 5 - 7 days before every blood extraction (short-term growth) and deviations of size (mass and tarsus length) from population averages {{at the age}} of blood extraction (long-term growth). We found a significant relationship between blood levels of alkaline phosphatase and short-term tarsus growth rate but not with long term tarsus growth. Urea levels were correlated with long-term mass growth but not with short-term growth. We found some chicks with relatively rapid mass growth, slow tarsus growth, and low levels of alkaline phosphatase after periods of fasting. Chicks of Imperial Eagles (<b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti)</b> showed less variable nestling periods but higher and more variable blood urea levels. These differences agree with theoretical predictions about the evolution of growth regulation abilities in relation to feeding ecology; the species with a more variable growth and more resistance to food deprivation can experience a more irregular and unpredictable food supply.

40|$|SUMMARY. —Supplementary {{feeding and}} the {{population}} dynamics of the Spanish imperial eagle. Supplementary feeding could be a useful technique to avoid losses of chicks in certain nests under peculiar circumstances, {{but it could be}} appropriate to prolong it {{until the end of the}} de-pendence period also. This would prevent the negative effects on breeders clearly pointed out by Blanco (2006). We have serious concerns about the real magnitude of siblicide in this species, as well as about the possible effect on the growth speed of the population that techniques aimed to improve fecundity would have. Consequently, the suggestion of extending this tech-nique to a large proportion of the breeding population must be seriously reconsidered. The idea that breeding populations and their fecundity are the main target for conservation plans must be revised, according to most recent advances on population dynamics of long-lived species and structure of populations Key words: <b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti,</b> brood reduction, cainism, management techniques, raptor con-servation, Spanish imperial eagle.

40|$|Methods to {{evaluate}} population trends have recently received particular attention because of perceived declines in several species during the 20 th century. We investigated whether {{age at first}} breeding {{could be used as}} an “early warning signal” to detect possible changes in population trends in long-lived species with deferred maturity using data from the Spanish imperial eagle (<b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti)</b> population in Doñana National Park (Spain). This bird of prey is an endangered species that has suffered a rapid decline in this population during the last 10 years. As a result of our 27 -year monitoring (1976 – 2002) study, we detected that an increase in immature breeding birds occurred before population decline became evident. The proportion of immature-plumaged breeders in the population was significantly higher during the period of decline than during the period of stability. In our case, more than 10 % of immature breeders can be considered as an “early warning signal” that anticipates population decline. Owing to the ignorance of this warning signal, urgent actions for the recovery of this eagle population started 10 years later than necessary, and when population size had been reducedPeer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Over {{a period}} of 19 years, we studied 237 {{breeding}} attempts of Spanish Imperial Eagles (<b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti)</b> in Doñana National Park (southwestern Spain), including 29 pairs {{with at least one}} immature member, to investigate age-related effects on population fecundity. Without considering effect of territory quality, adult pairs were significantly more productive than immature pairs. Highly significant differences in breeding performance among territories were independent of age-classes of birds occupying them. Low-quality territories were more frequently occupied by immature pairs, whereas high-quality territories were occupied mostly or exclusively by adult birds. Therefore, age and territory quality appear to be interrelated. We found no effect on average population fecundity due to breeding by immature pairs. We are indebted to L. García, R. Cadenas, and M.

40|$|We {{examined}} nest-site selection by Spanish Imperial Eagles (<b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti)</b> in Doñana National Park (southwestern Spain) from 1984 - 1994. Spanish Imperial Eagles {{are large}} {{birds of prey}} that defend and occupy a territory year-round. Identifying a territory's nest-site characteristics represents a critical step in safeguarding this endangered species' habitat. We measured seven habitat variables describing microhabitat, vegetative composition, land use, and degree of human influence for 73 nest sites averaged for 14 occupied territories and 73 randomly selected sites for 14 unoccupied territories. Our best logistic regression model included two habitat variables representing microhabitat (height of nest tree) and human influence (distance to the nearest urban centre). The logistic regression model correctly classified 78. 6 % of the occupied and 85. 7 % of unoccupied territories. This analysis suggests that the presently occupied Spanish Imperial Eagle territories represent {{the majority of the}} remaining suitable habitat for this endangered species in and around Doñana National Park. There is an urgent need to create suitable nest sites for Spanish Imperial Eagles that would include tall trees in small tree stands away from intense human activity. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{decline of}} rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations in Mediterranean Spain {{has been shown}} to be one of the main threats to rabbit-specialist predators such as the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardina) and the Spanish {{imperial}} eagle (<b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti),</b> two species which are in serious danger of extinction. Consequently, corrective measures such as increasing rabbit populations by restocking have been carried out to help the recovery of predator populations. In order to determine the general applicability of rabbit restocking for predator conservation, we performed three experimental restockings and evaluated their success in relation to season, habitat quality and the number of animals introduced. Rabbits were released either in large or small numbers in all four seasons of the year, and in habitat types defined as 'poor' or 'rich' according to the food availability for rabbits. For each restocking we evaluated rabbit survival, degree of residency and expected population increase. As a rule, the highest restocking success occurred whenever smaller number of rabbits were released in the richest quality habitat. Restocking during the breeding season was less successful than in other seasons. Problems concerning intraspecific competition, reproductive failure and diseases are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Raptors that consume game {{species may}} ingest lead {{fragments}} or shot embedded in their prey's flesh. Threatened Spanish imperial eagles <b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti</b> feed on greylag geese in southern Spain in winter, and often ingest lead shot. We analysed bone and feather samples from 65 Spanish imperial eagle museum specimens collected between 1980 and 1999, {{to investigate the}} prevalence of elevated lead concentrations. Four of 34 birds (12 %) had very elevated bone lead concentrations. All four birds were young and the concentrations were outliers to the distribution, suggesting probable exposure to lead gunshot. Excluding these elevated lead outliers, bone lead concentrations were correlated with the bird's age at death. Three of 41 feathers (7 %) had elevated lead concentrations, indicative of high exposure during feather formation. When these outliers were omitted, feather lead concentration was correlated with the age of museum specimens, suggesting that {{a high proportion of}} feather lead was exogenous, deposited after specimen collection. Therefore, careful interpretation of feather lead concentrations is required to separate endogenous and exogenous lead.

40|$|After some 70 {{years of}} debate on density-dependent {{regulation}} of animal populations, {{there is still}} poor understanding of where spatial and temporal density dependence occurs. Clearly defining {{the portion of the}} population that shapes density-dependent patterns may help to solve some of the ambiguities that encircle density dependence and its patterns. In fact, individuals of the same species and population can show different dynamics and behaviors depending on their locations (e. g., breeding vs. dispersal areas). Considering this form of intrapopulation heterogeneity may improve our understanding of density dependence and population dynamics in general. We present the results of individual-based simulations on a metapopulation of the Spanish imperial eagle <b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti.</b> Our results suggest that high rates of floater mortality within settlement areas can determine a shift in the classical relationship (from negative to positive) between the fecundity (i. e., fledglings per pair) and density (i. e., number of pairs) of the breeding population. Finally, we proved that different initial conditions affecting the breeder portion of the population can lead to the same values of fecundity. Our results can represent a starting point for new and more complex approaches studying the regulation of animal populations, where the forgotten and invisible component-the floater-is taken into account. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.

40|$|Electrocution by {{power lines}} {{is one of}} the main causes of non-natural {{mortality}} in birds of prey. In an area in central Spain, we surveyed 6304 pylons from 333 power lines to determine electrocution rates, environmental and design factors that may influence electrocution and the efficacy of mitigation measures used to minimise electrocution cases. A total of 952 electrocuted raptors, representing 14 different species, were observed. Electrocuted raptors were concentrated in certain areas and the environmental factors associated with increased electrocution events were: greater numbers of prey animals; greater vegetation cover; and shorter distance to roads. The structural elements associated with electrocutions were shorter strings of insulators, one or more phases over the crossarm, cross-shaped design and pylon function. Of the 952 carcasses found, 148 were eagles, including golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), Spanish imperial eagle (<b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti)</b> and Bonelli’s eagle (Aquila fasciata). Electrocuted eagles were clustered in smaller areas than other electrocuted raptors. The factors associated with increased eagle electrocution events were: pylons function, shorter strings of insulators, higher slopes surrounding the pylon, and more numerous potential prey animals. Pylons with increased string of insulators had lower raptor electrocution rates than unimproved pylons, although this technique was unsuccessful for eagles. Pylons with cabl...|$|R

It contains the largest wetland in Western Europe (García Novo and Marín Cabrera 2005), an intricate matrix of marshlands (270 km 2), phreatic lagoons, and a 25 km-long dune ecosystem with its respective shoreline and representative Mediterranean terrestrial plant communities (Fig. 28. 1).

Doñana marshlands have a typical Mediterranean climate: the hydrological cycle starts in September and usually reaches maximum inundation levels during February, mainly driven by the rainfall regime. In late spring, evaporation becomes {{the most important factor}} in the water balance, and the marshes dry up slowly until they are completely dry by the end of July.

40|$|We {{report on}} a 32 -yr study of a {{population}} of Spanish Imperial Eagles, <b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti,</b> which increased during the first 16 yr of study but remained stable during the last 16 yr. We analyzed changes in the mean and variance of fecundity in relation to population density to test predictions of two hypotheses of density-dependent fecundity. According to the >interference> hypothesis, as density increases, frequency of agonistic encounters increases, resulting in a relatively uniform decrease in habitat quality. Consequently, mean fecundity decreases, and no relationship is expected between density and variance in fecundity. For the >habitat heterogeneity> hypothesis, however, as density increases, {{a greater proportion of}} individuals are forced to occupy lower quality habitats. Thus, mean fecundity decreases and fecundity variance must increase. Additionally, for this hypothesis, fecundities in good sites are expected to be equal in both low- and high-density situations. An inverse relationship between fecundity and population size was found in this eagle population. Annual variance in productivity showed significant increases over the study period. This trend was inversely related to mean productivity. Variance in productivity was related to the year of pair establishment, being higher in recently occupied territories. Mean and variance of the longer term territories remained constant during the study period. These results are in accordance with the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} an 11 –year study of floater {{interference}} {{in a population}} of Spanish Imperial Eagles <b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti.</b> We analyzed changes {{over the years in}} the productivity of 15 territories to test predictions of two hypotheses of density-dependent productivity in relation to the presence of floaters (birds without territories). According to the ‘interference’ hypothesis, the frequency of intrusion by floaters increases with density, resulting in a decrease in productivity. Thus, in a high-density population a negative relationship between floater intrusions and productivity of the territory is expected. In contrast, under the ‘habitat heterogeneity’ hypothesis, as density increases a higher proportion of individuals is forced to occupy lower quality habitats. Support of this hypothesis requires that floaters detect differences in quality among territories and preferentially visit the better quality territories. Consequently, a positive relationship between floater intrusions and productivity is expected. Results showed that floaters tended to visit their natal area {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season. Among floater eagles, males made significantly more intrusions per day than did females, but females stayed in the natal population for longer each year than males. Floater intrusions and productivity were highly positively correlated, supporting the ‘habitat heterogeneity’ hypothesis; individuals were apparently able to assess the quality of a territory and, at the frequencies observed, their interference with the breeding pair had no obvious negative effect on productivity...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Most European {{birds of}} prey find {{themselves}} in a poor state of conservation, with electrocution {{as one of the most}} frequent causes of unnatural death. Since early detection of electrocution is difficult, treatment is usually implemented late, which reduces its effectiveness. By considering that electrocution reduces tissue temperature, it may be detectable by thermography, which would allow a more rapid identification. Three individuals from three endangered raptor species [Spanish imperial eagle (<b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti),</b> Lammergeier (Gypaetus barbatus) and Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) ] were studied thermographically from the time they were admitted to a rehabilitation centre to the time their clinical cases were resolved. CASES PRESENTATION The three raptors presented lesions lacking thermal bilateral symmetry and were consistent with electrocution of feet, wings and eyes, visible by thermography before than clinically; lesions were well-defined and showed a lower temperature than the surrounding tissue. Some lesions evolved thermally and clinically until the appearance of normal tissue recovered, while others evolved and became necrotic. A histopathological analysis of a damaged finger amputated off a Lammergeier, and the necropsy and histopathology examination of an osprey, confirmed the electrocution diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that thermography is effective and useful for the objective and early detection and monitoring of electrocuted birds, and that it may prove especially useful for examining live animals that require no amputation or cannot be subjected to invasive histopathology...|$|R

This is particularly relevant in Iberian Palaeolithic sites where leporid remains usually constitute the most abundant taxon. Among diurnal raptors the Spanish Imperial eagle (<b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti)</b> {{has been one of the}} most important leporid predators throughout the Iberian Peninsula. In order to investigate the taphonomic signature of this raptor, rabbit remains from 79 pellets were examined. Results show a high proportion of distal elements of the limb bones and skull. Compared with other diurnal birds of prey, the assemblages produced by this species appear to show a higher degree of breakage and corrosion from digestion. These results place this predator within a category similar to the small mammal carnivores (category 5) in terms of skeletal element abundance, breakage and digestion. It is hoped that these data will enable analysts to identify leporid fossils accumulated by the Spanish Imperial Eagle in archaeological assemblages.

40|$|The Spanish {{imperial}} eagle (<b>Aquila</b> <b>adalberti)</b> {{is considered to}} be the most endangered European eagle. The species is an endemic resident in the Southwestern Iberian Peninsula. We used RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and seroneutralization to test samples from 13 wild and 18 captive eagles. WNV was detected by RT-PCR in tissues and/or oropharyngeal swabs of eight of 10 (80 %) {{imperial eagle}}s analyzed, and both in apparently clinically healthy birds, and in animals that died due to secondary infections but had symptoms/lesions compatible with WNV. Immunohistochemistry detected WNV antigen in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, epithelial cells of the gizzard and duodenum, perivascular inflammatory cells, and in Kupffer-cells and hepatocytes. Serum antibodies against WNV were detected in a total of five out of 21 imperial eagles (23. 8 %), including free-living nestlings (two out of nine samples, 22. 2 %) and captive adult eagles (three out of 12 samples, 25 %). Our results evidence WNV circulation among free-living and captive Spanish imperial eagles in South-central Spain, a dry inland region with no previous WNV evidence, throughout 6 consecutive years. They also indicate the need for further research into this important zoonosis in order to better understand its epidemiology in the Mediterranean ecosystem and {{in order to understand the}} role of WNV in the population dynamics of the critically endangered Spanish imperial eagle. © 2007 Elsevier B.
