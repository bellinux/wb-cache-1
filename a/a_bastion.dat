5|$|New Western Tower (or the Great Tower), {{built in}} 1544 and {{which served as}} <b>a</b> <b>bastion.</b> The tower {{contained}} one of the castle's printing presses, and also provided an artillery platform to cover the vast fields surrounding it. It was damaged in a severe storm in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Vendôme Bastion – <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> {{built in}} 1614 linking the French Curtain to Fort St. Elmo, {{containing}} an echaugette.

5|$|In 2008, {{restoration}} {{began in}} Mdina, Birgu and the Cittadella. In Mdina, {{some of the}} bastions had started to slip down the clay slopes, and steel rods were inserted in the walls to reinforce them. Throughout the course of restoration, a number of archaeological remains have been found, including remains of Mdina's Punic-Roman and medieval walls, <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> and a caponier in Birgu, the Cittadella's original entrance, {{and a number of}} other features.|$|E
5|$|During Sa'ad Zaghloul's term as {{minister}} of education, {{before he went}} on to lead the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, further efforts were made to modify the educational policy of al-Azhar. While <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> of conservatism in many regards, the mosque was opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, especially as espoused by the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928. The school attracted students from throughout the world, including students from Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia, providing a counterbalance to the influence of the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia.|$|E

5|$|In addition, <b>a</b> <b>bastioned</b> enceinte {{known as}} the North Entrenchment is located behind the entire Marsamxett enceinte, acting as a {{secondary}} line of defence.|$|R
50|$|The new Østervold was {{constructed}} {{and a new}} project for the fortress at Sankt Annæ Skanse, with the layout of <b>a</b> <b>bastioned</b> pentagram, was completed in 1661.|$|R
5|$|Mendelssohn enjoyed {{early success}} in Germany, {{where he also}} revived {{interest}} in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, and in his travels throughout Europe. He was particularly well received in Britain as a composer, conductor and soloist, and his ten visits there– during which many of his major works were premiered– form {{an important part of}} his adult career. His essentially conservative musical tastes set him apart from many of his more adventurous musical contemporaries such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Charles-Valentin Alkan and Hector Berlioz. The Leipzig Conservatoire (now the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig), which he founded, became <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> of this anti-radical outlook.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} history of Gibraltar during World War II exemplifies Gibraltar's {{position as a}} British fortress since the early 18th century and as a vital factor in British military strategy, both as a foothold on the continent of Europe, and as <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> of British sea power. During World War II, Gibraltar served {{a vital role in}} both the Atlantic Theatre and the Mediterranean Theatre, controlling virtually all naval traffic {{into and out of the}} Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of whiskey {{was certainly not}} a norm in the colonies in the early years. The upper echelon of colonial society looked down upon American whiskey up until {{the time of the}} American Revolution. Some even saw the harsh spirit as <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> of debauchery in the American colonies. Whatever the sentiment, the Scottish, Irish, and Germans brought a taste for hard spirits from their homelands to the American colonies in the 1730s. These groups continued to produce hard spirits in imported stills, or stills based on Old World designs, in retaliation against the English economic controls.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-18th century, <b>a</b> <b>bastioned</b> enceinte was {{proposed}} around the tower, {{but it was}} never built. Eventually, Fort Chambray was built {{on the opposite side of}} Mġarr.|$|R
25|$|Fort Chambray {{consists}} of four main parts: <b>a</b> <b>bastioned</b> land front and its outworks, two flanks overlooking Mġarr Harbour and Xatt l-Aħmar, and a cliff face facing the sea.|$|R
50|$|The Castillo de San Julián is {{essentially}} <b>a</b> <b>bastioned</b> fort, {{but it also}} contains tenailles and caponiers, which are typical of polygonal forts. It is built in neoclassical architecture.|$|R
5|$|A bailey, {{also called}} a ward, was a {{fortified}} enclosure. It {{was a common}} feature of castles, and most had at least one. The keep {{on top of the}} motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> of last defence, while the bailey was the home {{of the rest of the}} lord's household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities were often found in the bailey. Water was supplied by a well or cistern. Over time the focus of high status accommodation shifted from the keep to the bailey; this resulted in the creation of another bailey that separated the high status buildings– such as the lord's chambers and the chapel– from the everyday structures such as the workshops and barracks.|$|E
5|$|As Finland was {{negotiating}} with the Soviet Union for peace, the Oberkommando des Heeres {{paid attention to the}} Narva front, using every means to convince the Finnish Defence Command that their defence was going to hold. The German command informed their Finnish colleagues in detail about the events on the Narva front while a delegation of the Finnish Defence Command visited Narva in spring 1944. Besides being a narrow corridor well suited for defence, the terrain in the area of Narva was dominated by forests and swamps. Directly behind the Narva River lay the city itself, ideally positioned as <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> from which defending forces could influence combat to both the north and south of the city along the river valley.|$|E
5|$|Barely {{five years}} after {{upgrades}} were completed in 1888, it was suggested the fort be demolished. Debates over the fort lingered on between the Colonial Defence Committee in London, and the Local Defence Committee in Singapore for nearly a decade. The fort was finally rendered obsolete and abandoned in 1901 when the guns were removed. Instead of destroying the fort, the British thought it simpler to bury it, which was done sometime after World War I. A portion of <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> was still visible above ground well into the 1960s, when a public park was built atop the fort for the fast-growing Katong suburbs. In the late 1960s, the bastion was finally buried when land reclamation in the East Coast took place, and its memory was soon forgotten in the ensuing decades.|$|E
50|$|The {{design was}} that of a Star fort with <b>a</b> <b>bastioned</b> trace. <b>A</b> {{detached}} redoubt, Fort Irwin was linked to the fort. To seaward the Clarence Battery was constructed.|$|R

5|$|In 1757, Lembi Battery, an outwork of Fort Manoel, {{was built}} on the {{northern}} shore of the peninsula. <b>A</b> <b>bastioned</b> entrenchment was proposed in the early 1760s, but it was never built.|$|R
5|$|During the 1550s, Henry II became {{concerned}} about the threat of an English or Holy Roman Empire attack on Paris, and strengthened the defences of the Bastille in response. The southern gateway into the Bastille became the principal entrance to the castle in 1553, the other three gateways being closed. <b>A</b> <b>bastion,</b> a large earthwork projecting eastwards from the Bastille, was built to provide additional protective fire for the Bastille and the Arsenal; the bastion was reached from the fortress across a stone abutment using a connecting drawbridge that was installed in the Bastille's Comté tower. In 1573 the Porte Saint-Antoine was also altered – the drawbridges were replaced with a fixed bridge, and the medieval gatehouse was replaced with a triumphal arch.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer brought {{together}} intellectuals {{at the height}} of their powers and from a variety of disciplines to answer the most pertinent questions of the age. He directed and encouraged the research of many well-known scientists, including Freeman Dyson, and the duo of Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee, who won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of parity non-conservation. He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as T. S. Eliot and George F. Kennan. Some of these activities were resented by a few members of the mathematics faculty, who wanted the institute to stay <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> of pure scientific research. Abraham Pais said that Oppenheimer himself thought that one of his failures at the institute was being unable to bring together scholars from the natural sciences and the humanities.|$|E
5|$|Prison {{films of}} the pre-Code era often {{involved}} {{men and women who}} were unjustly incarcerated, and films set in prisons of the north tended to portray them as <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> of solidarity against the crumbling social system of the Great Depression. Sparked by the real-life Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930, in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells, causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions inside prisons in the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconian system of discipline in the blazing outdoor heat, where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors.|$|E
50|$|In 1796, {{following}} {{the development of}} Blue Town, a wider area of land (including the new houses) was enclosed behind <b>a</b> <b>bastioned</b> trace, which was further strengthened during the Napoleonic Wars of the following century.|$|R
50|$|Forte Gonzaga, {{also known}} as Castel Gonzaga, is <b>a</b> <b>bastioned</b> fort in Messina, Sicily. It {{was built in the}} mid-16th century, and it {{remained}} in use by the military until 1973. Today, the fort is in good condition.|$|R
5|$|Fort Ricasoli has an {{irregular}} plan following the coastline {{of the peninsula}} it is built upon. The fort consists of <b>a</b> <b>bastioned</b> land front and its outworks, an enceinte facing the sea, and a tenaille trace facing Rinella Bay of the Grand Harbour.|$|R
5|$|The Ottomans quickly {{transformed}} {{the city from}} <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> of Christianity to a symbol of Islamic culture. Religious foundations were established to fund the construction of ornate imperial mosques, often adjoined by schools, hospitals, and public baths. The Ottoman Dynasty claimed the status of caliphate in 1517, with Istanbul remaining the capital of this last caliphate for four centuries. Suleiman the Magnificent's reign from 1520 to 1566 {{was a period of}} especially great artistic and architectural achievement; chief architect Mimar Sinan designed several iconic buildings in the city, while Ottoman arts of ceramics, stained glass, calligraphy, and miniature flourished. The population of Istanbul was 570,000 {{by the end of the}} 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{field at}} Waterloo was 5.5km wide, with two {{parallel}} ridges running west to east, creating a shallow valley 1.4km across. On the allied right lay the chateau of Hougoumont, {{a collection of}} walled farm buildings lying closer to the French line than the Allies' line. Recognising its defensive importance, Wellington ordered Hanoverian and Nassau troops to occupy the farm. In allied hands, it would provide cover for flanking fire against any French assault of the main allied line; in French hands, it would provide <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> from which they could launch attacks. Since it defended the Nivelles road {{as well as the}} Allies' right flank, Wellington ordered that it was to be held at all costs.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{was drawn}} back into public service by the Old Court – New Court controversy. When {{legislation}} aimed at providing {{relief to the}} state's debtors was struck down by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, supporters of the legislation in the General Assembly passed a bill abolishing the Court and creating a new court, which they stocked with sympathetic justices. Opponents of the legislation held that the Assembly's action was unconstitutional, and for a time, both courts claimed authority as the court of last resort in the state. Though he had {{served as president of}} the New Court-backed Bank of the Commonwealth since its formation in 1820, Crittenden publicly identified himself with the Old Court supporters in April 1825. In the legislative election of 1825, friends called on Crittenden to seek election to the state House of Representatives. Many believed that he was the only Old Court supporter that commanded enough respect to win one of the two seats allotted to Franklin County, <b>a</b> <b>bastion</b> of the New Court. When Crittenden consented to run, New Court supporters nominated the state's Attorney General Solomon P. Sharp and Lewis Sanders, a prominent lawyer. Crittenden and Sharp were elected to the two seats.|$|E
50|$|Fort Saint Angelo (Forti SantAnġlu or Fortizza SantAnġlu) is <b>a</b> large <b>bastioned</b> fort in Birgu, Malta, {{located at}} {{the centre of the}} Grand Harbour. It was {{originally}} built in the medieval period as a castle called the Castrum Maris or the Castello al Mare. It was rebuilt by the Order of Saint John as <b>a</b> <b>bastioned</b> fort called Fort Saint Angelo between the 1530s and the 1690s, and it is best known for its role as the Orders headquarters during the Great Siege of Malta of 1565.|$|R
50|$|The site {{immediately}} {{to the north of}} the house is surrounded by earth mounds in the form of <b>a</b> <b>bastioned</b> breastwork. These features were added during the 1950s restoration, stated to have been built in accordance with original plans by Anderson and Sharpe, and are not of historical origin.|$|R
50|$|In 1599, a major {{reconstruction}} of the Cittadella begun to designs of the military engineer Giovanni Rinaldini and {{under the direction of}} Vittorio Cassar. The southern walls of the city were completely rebuilt as <b>a</b> <b>bastioned</b> enceinte with <b>a</b> single <b>bastion</b> and two demi-bastions linked by curtain walls, along with two cavaliers, a ditch and outworks. Parts of the northern walls were also rebuilt by the Hospitallers, although they retained a medieval form. The walls surrounding the suburb Rabat were probably demolished at this point. The reconstruction to Rinaldini's and Cassar's designs was completed in around 1622.|$|R
