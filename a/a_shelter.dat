5|$|By September 1, the facility, {{like the}} Superdome, was {{completely}} overwhelmed and declared unsafe and unsanitary. However, {{even though there}} were thousands of people who were evacuating at the center, along with network newscasters, pleading desperately for help on CNN, FOX, and other broadcast outlets, FEMA head Michael Brown and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff both claimed to have no knowledge of the use of the Convention Center as <b>a</b> <b>shelter</b> until the afternoon of September 1.|$|E

5|$|In Baldwin County, Alabama, a local {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared on November9 as Ida neared landfall. Voluntary evacuations were declared for residents living along coastal areas or in mobile homes. All government offices were closed until November10 due to the storm. The Baldwin County Coliseum was converted into <b>a</b> <b>shelter</b> to house possible evacuees during the storm as well. In Mississippi, officials advised residents to remain vigilant and discussed possible evacuations. Residents living near Pensacola Beach, Florida, and nearby Perdido Key were urged to evacuate. On November8, emergency officials declared a {{state of emergency}} in Escambia County. The following day, Walton County was also placed under a state of emergency ahead of Hurricane Ida's arrival. Voluntary evacuations were issued for residents in low-lying areas and all non-emergency offices were closed until November10.

5|$|Predator {{avoidance}} {{may also}} explain the frequent behaviour where S.latus will carry food items back to <b>a</b> <b>shelter</b> before consuming them. When two S.latus individuals {{compete for a}} food item, they may use the enlarged second antennae to flip their opponent over, by wedging the antennae underneath the opponent's body and quickly raising them. An alternative strategy is to grip an opponent and begin the tail-flipping movement, or {{to engage in a}} tug of war.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} later, the current {{fortress}} was built {{close to the}} desert edge by the Zengid–Ayyubid lord Shirkuh. The latter's descendants held al-Rahba as a hereditary fief granted by Saladin until 1264. One of them, Shirkuh II, oversaw a third major reconstruction in 1207. Through the early Mamluk era (late 13th–14th centuries), the fortress was continuously restored and strengthened {{as a result of}} frequent sieges by the Ilkhanid Mongols of Iraq. Al-Rahba was the most important Mamluk fortress along the Euphrates, an administrative center and the terminal stop on the sultanate's postal route. It fell into disuse during Ottoman rule (1517–1918) and from then until the early 20th century, the fortress primarily served as <b>a</b> <b>shelter</b> for local shepherds and their flocks. Excavations were carried out at the site between 1976 and 1981.|$|E

5|$|Authors {{have speculated}} {{on a range}} of {{buildings}} that could account for the Tower appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a Norman peel tower, built as a defence against Scottish raiders or might have been a disused poacher's lookout, but {{it is more likely that}} despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage. Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps <b>a</b> <b>shelter</b> for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation. Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel, and tower may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents. It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, Houston became <b>a</b> <b>shelter</b> to {{more than}} 150,000 people from New Orleans, who {{evacuated}} from Hurricane Katrina. One month later, about 2.5million Houston-area residents evacuated when Hurricane Rita approached the Gulf Coast, leaving little damage to the Houston area. This was the largest urban evacuation {{in the history of}} the United States. In September 2008, Houston was hit by Hurricane Ike. As many as 40% of residents refused to leave Galveston Island because they feared the type of traffic problems that had happened after Hurricane Rita.|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, octopuses can {{be readily}} trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns. They {{have been reported to}} practise observational learning, although the validity of these findings is contested. Octopuses have also been observed in what has been described as play: repeatedly releasing bottles or toys into a circular current in their aquariums and then catching them. Octopuses often break out of their aquariums and sometimes into others in search of food. They have even boarded fishing boats and opened holds to eat crabs. The veined octopus collects discarded coconut shells, then uses them to build <b>a</b> <b>shelter,</b> an example of tool use.|$|E
