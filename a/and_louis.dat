5|$|Long-running {{tensions}} between Henry <b>and</b> <b>Louis</b> VII continued during the 1160s, the French king slowly becoming more vigorous in opposing Henry's increasing power in Europe. In 1160 Louis strengthened his alliances in central France with the Count of Champagne and Odo II, the Duke of Burgundy. Three {{years later the}} new Count of Flanders, Philip, concerned about Henry's growing power, openly allied himself with the French king. Louis's wife Adèle {{gave birth to a}} male heir, Philip Augustus, in 1165, <b>and</b> <b>Louis</b> was more confident of his own position than for many years previously. As a result, relations between Henry <b>and</b> <b>Louis</b> deteriorated again in the mid-1160s.|$|E
