30|$|A {{number of}} {{approaches}} exist {{to mitigate the}} impact of clutter non-stationarity on <b>clutter</b> <b>suppression</b> by means of compensation for bistatic airborne radar [8 – 16]. In [8 – 12], the mainlobe clutter peak is compensated only from training range cell-to-cell under test (CUT) effectively, and they take little account of compensation for sidelobe clutter. In [13 – 16], the mainlobe and sidelobe clutter peaks are compensated simultaneously. The above methods are more suitable to bistatic airborne radar with low pulse repetition frequency (PRF), whereas, in the high PRF case (i.e., range ambiguity exists), the performance of these methods degrades severely. In this article, a novel <b>clutter</b> <b>suppression</b> method for bistatic airborne radar with range ambiguity is presented, and it completes registration-based compensation based on non-uniform sampling (RBCNS) and the estimated clutter degrees of freedom (DOFs); therefore, the ultimate <b>clutter</b> <b>suppression</b> performance is improved evidently.|$|R

Processing results using simulated and measured data show that the proposed algorithm converges faster than the NLMS algorithms in Gaussian and non-Gaussian clutter environments.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate and compare different methods for surface clutter cancellation and to implement a Processing Tool to augment the along-track POLARIS processor developed by ESA, thus improving bedrock detectability. Five algorithms have been selected for implementation and analysis: the standard beamformer, two different clutter nulling algorithms, the optimum beamformer and the MVDR beamformer. Prior to the analysis with real POLARIS data the algorithms have been implemented in a simulation environment, allowing for a performance analysis concerning the different input parameters. These included pulse bandwidth, aircraft roll, cross-track terrain slopes, as well as POLARIS antenna patterns. The improved performance of the nulling, MVDR and optimum beamformer techniques for surface <b>clutter</b> <b>suppression</b> compared to standard beamformer has been demonstrated and requirements on the knowledge of slope and roll parameters have been quantified for nulling and optimum beamformer algoorithms. By means of simulation it was shown that the relatively large separation of the POLARIS phase centers (lambda) is responsible for regions of high noise scaling around +/- 45 deg off-nadir angle, which turned out to be annoying in particular for the application of the nulling techniques. The optimum beamformer and the MVDR instead are able to better handle these angular regions. The <b>clutter</b> <b>suppression</b> performance has also been demonstrated with the available POLARIS data from the IceGrav 2011 campaign. For all 4 available data takes a clear improvement in <b>clutter</b> <b>suppression</b> performance could be achieved, independent of the signal bandwidth. It was shown that, in terms of <b>clutter</b> <b>suppression,</b> the advanced methods (nulling, optimum beamformer and MVDR) outperform the standard beamformer by up to 15 dB. However, it was also shown that a major limitation for the performance of nulling and optimum beamformer is the requirement of a highly accurate ice surface model. For the purpose of this study preliminary TanDEM-X DEM data were used to avoid the limited accuracy and artefacts of ASTER 2 GDEM data. However, comparison with Laser altimetry data revealed uncertainties in the used TanDEM-X data due to the limited calibration performed. Also the different penetration depth of P-band, confirmed by Direction-of-Arrival estimates of clutter angles from the radar data, turned out to be an issue for consideration. In summary the MVDR technique proofed to be an easy to implement and the most robust technique since it does not require inputs on the ice surface topography, leading to the best <b>clutter</b> <b>suppression</b> results. These findings have been confirmed by simulation also for some selected spaceborne scenarios.
