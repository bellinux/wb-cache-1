500|$|The reserve's {{location}} {{means that}} migrants may be found, sometimes in huge numbers {{when the weather}} conditions are right. These may include vagrant rarities. A black-winged stilt, which acquired the nickname [...] "Sammy", arrived in 1993 and became a permanent resident up to its disappearance in 2005. Other rarities in recent years include a Baird's sandpiper, a broad-billed sandpiper, a thrush nightingale and an <b>Arctic</b> <b>redpoll,</b> all in 2004, a stilt sandpiper in 2005, and a black-winged pratincole and a black-headed wagtail in 2009.|$|E
500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, <b>Arctic</b> <b>redpoll</b> and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>redpoll</b> (Acanthis hornemanni), {{known in}} North America as the hoary redpoll, is a bird {{species in the}} finch family Fringillidae. It breeds in tundra birch forest. It has two subspecies, A. h. hornemanni (Greenland or Hornemann's <b>Arctic</b> <b>redpoll)</b> of Greenland and {{neighbouring}} parts of Canada, and A. h. exilipes (Coues's <b>Arctic</b> <b>redpoll),</b> which breeds in the tundra of northern North America and Eurasia. Many birds remain in the far north; some birds migrate short distances south in winter, sometimes travelling with common redpolls.|$|E
50|$|The mealy redpoll {{is larger}} and paler than the lesser redpoll {{with which it}} often mixes, {{apparently}} without significant interbreeding though sympatry was established too recently to draw firm conclusions. The male mealy redpolls are darker than the similarly sized <b>Arctic</b> <b>redpolls</b> but the females are almost identical.|$|R
50|$|The common redpoll was {{previously}} {{placed in the}} genus Carduelis. Molecular phylogenetic studies showed that the <b>Arctic</b> and common <b>redpolls</b> formed a distinct lineage, so the two species were grouped together in the resurrected genus Acanthis.|$|R
50|$|The common redpoll (Acanthis flammea) is {{a species}} of bird in the finch family. It breeds {{somewhat}} further south than the <b>Arctic</b> <b>redpoll,</b> also in habitats with thickets or shrubs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>redpoll</b> is {{partially}} migratory {{and tends to}} move southwards in November and north again in March and April. It feeds mainly on seeds, particularly of alder and birch trees.|$|E
50|$|He is also commemorated in the {{specific}} epethets for the bird Carduelis hornemanni (<b>Arctic</b> <b>Redpoll),</b> the flowering plant Epilobium hornemannii Rchb. (Hornemann's willowherb) and the agaric fungus Stropharia hornemannii (Fr.) S. Lundell & Nannf. (1934).|$|E
50|$|They are {{primarily}} seed-eaters, and often feed acrobatically like a tit; their diet may include some insects in summer. They have a dry reeling song and a metallic call. They lay four to seven {{eggs in a}} nest in a tree or, {{in the case of}} the <b>Arctic</b> <b>redpoll,</b> a large bush. They can form large flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes mixed with other finches.|$|E

50|$|Birds, {{especially}} seabirds, are {{an important}} part of Greenland's animal life. On steep mountainsides breed large colonies of auks, puffins, skuas, and kittiwakes. By common ducks include eiders, long-tailed ducks and the king eider and in West Greenland white-fronted goose and in East Greenland pink-footed goose and barnacle goose. Breeding migratory birds are also including snow bunting, lapland bunting, ringed plover, red-throated loon and red-necked phalarope. Of land birds that are usually sedentary, can be highlighted <b>arctic</b> <b>redpoll,</b> ptarmigan, short-eared owl, snowy owl, gyrfalcon and in West Greenland the white-tailed eagle.|$|E
50|$|The common redpoll {{is a small}} brownish-grey finch {{with dark}} streaks and a bright red patch on its forehead. It has a black bib and two pale stripes on the wings. Males often have their breasts suffused with red. It is smaller, browner and more {{streaked}} than the generally similar <b>Arctic</b> <b>redpoll,</b> adults measuring between 11.5 and 14 cm in length and weighing between 12 and 16 g. The rump is streaked {{and there is a}} broad dark brown streak across the vent. It has brown legs, dark-tipped yellowish bills and dark brown irises.|$|E
50|$|There {{are about}} 400 plant and tree {{species on the}} bay shores, {{including}} birch, willow, alder and plants adapted to salty soils, as well as lyme grass, mosses, and lichens. These serve as food for caribou and rodents, such as lemming. Resident fish species include polar cod, Arctic flounder (Pleuronectidae, Liopsetta), four-horned sculpin and capelin, whereas cod, haddock, herring, halibut, and rattail migrate from the Atlantic. The birds are represented by the little auk, snowy owl, willow ptarmigan, rock ptarmigan, gyrfalcon, <b>Arctic</b> <b>redpoll</b> and guillemots. Most of them migrate to the south during the winter.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>redpoll</b> {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the common redpoll but generally paler. It may be distinguished from that species by the unstreaked pale rump patch and the uniformly pale vent area. The Greenland race is a very large, pale bird, with the male sometimes described as a [...] "snowball", but both forms are pale with small beaks, white rumps and often more yellow than grey-brown tones in their plumage. They have black bibs, orangish forehead patches and two light-coloured stripes on each wing. The females are more streaked on their breasts, sides and rumps, but are still pale. Adults are about 12 to 14 cm in length and weigh about 12 to 16 g.|$|E

40|$|The second {{report of}} the Croatian Rarities Committee {{presents}} 37 records of rare birds received after 2002. Four species and one subspecies: Western Reef-egret Egretta garzetta gullaris, Bewick’s Swan Cygnus columbianus, Terek Sandpiper Xenus cinereus, Ring-billed Gull Larus delawarensis and Yellow-browed Warbler Phylloscopus inornatus {{were added to the}} list of Croatian birds and one, <b>Arctic</b> <b>Redpoll</b> Acanthis hornemanni was omitted, giving the total number of 381 bird species recorded in Croatia. Two species, White-billed Diver Gavia adamsii and Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax were observed {{for the first time in}} last 50 years. The list of rare species now includes 50 species. Checklist of bird species is given in the Appendix of this Report...|$|E
