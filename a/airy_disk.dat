25|$|Independently, {{as a third}} {{meaning of}} the term, {{the shape of the}} <b>Airy</b> <b>disk</b> {{resulting}} from the wave diffraction on a circular aperture is sometimes also denoted as the Airy function (see e.g. here).

25|$|A 2017 {{study by}} Intel showed that for semi-isolated vias (whose <b>Airy</b> <b>disk</b> can be {{approximated}} by a Gaussian), the sensitivity of CD to dose was particularly strong, strong enough that a reduction of dose could nonlinearly lead to failure to print the via.|$|E

5000|$|Apodization is {{an optical}} {{filtering}} technique, and its literal translation is [...] "removing the foot". It is the technical term {{for changing the}} shape of a mathematical function, an electrical signal, an optical transmission or a mechanical structure. In optics, it is primarily used to remove <b>Airy</b> <b>disks</b> caused by diffraction around an intensity peak, improving the focus.|$|R
500|$|In the Starry Messenger, Galileo {{reported}} that stars appeared as mere blazes of light, essentially unaltered in appearance by the telescope, and contrasted them to planets, which the telescope {{revealed to be}} discs. But shortly thereafter, in his Letters on Sunspots, he {{reported that}} the telescope revealed the shapes of both stars and planets to be [...] "quite round". From that point forward, he continued to report that telescopes showed the roundness of stars, and that stars seen through the telescope measured {{a few seconds of}} arc in diameter. He also devised a method for measuring the apparent size of a star without a telescope. As described in his Dialogue Concerning the two Chief World Systems, his method was to hang a thin rope in his line of sight to the star and measure the maximum distance from which it would wholly obscure the star. From his measurements of this distance and of the width of the rope, he could calculate the angle subtended by the star at his viewing point. In his Dialogue, he reported that he had found the apparent diameter of a star of first magnitude to be no more than 5 arcseconds, and that of one of sixth magnitude to be about 5/6 arcseconds. Like most astronomers of his day, Galileo did not recognise that the apparent sizes of stars that he measured were spurious, caused by diffraction and atmospheric distortion (see seeing disk or <b>Airy</b> <b>disk),</b> and did not represent the true sizes of stars. However, Galileo's values were much smaller than previous estimates of the apparent sizes of the brightest stars, such as those made by Tycho Brahe (see Magnitude) and enabled Galileo to counter anti-Copernican arguments such as those made by Tycho that these stars would have to be absurdly large for their annual parallaxes to be undetectable. Other astronomers such as Simon Marius, Giovanni Battista Riccioli, and Martinus Hortensius made similar measurements of stars, and Marius and Riccioli concluded the smaller sizes were not small enough to answer Tycho's argument.|$|E

5000|$|At {{very high}} magnifications with {{transmitted}} light, point objects {{are seen as}} fuzzy discs surrounded by diffraction rings. These are called <b>Airy</b> <b>disks.</b> The resolving power of a microscope is taken {{as the ability to}} distinguish between two closely spaced <b>Airy</b> <b>disks</b> (or, in other words the ability of the microscope to reveal adjacent structural detail as distinct and separate). It is these impacts of diffraction that limit the ability to resolve fine details. The extent and magnitude of the diffraction patterns are affected by both the wavelength of light (λ), the refractive materials used to manufacture the objective lens and the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens. There is therefore a finite limit beyond which it is impossible to resolve separate points in the objective field, known as the diffraction limit. Assuming that optical aberrations in the whole optical set-up are negligible, the resolution d, can be stated as: ...|$|R

Advantages and feasibility of arrays of heat traps are considered. Beam patterns, flux concentration, and performance variation with wavelength are dealt with.

50|$|Riccioli {{also used}} {{telescopic}} observations of stars {{to argue against}} the Copernican theory. Viewed through the small telescopes of his time, stars appeared as small but distinct disks. These disks were spurious - caused by the diffraction of waves of light entering the telescope. Today they are known as <b>Airy</b> <b>disks,</b> after the nineteenth-century astronomer George Biddell Airy (1801-1892). The real disks of stars are generally too tiny to be seen even {{with the best of}} modern telescopes. But during most of the seventeenth century it was thought that these disks seen in a telescope were the actual bodies of stars. In the Copernican theory, the stars had to lie at vast distances from Earth in order to explain why no annual parallax was seen among them. Riccioli and Grimaldi made numerous measurements of star disks using a telescope, providing a detailed description of their procedure so that anyone who wanted could replicate it. Riccioli then calculated the physical sizes that the measured stars would need to have in order for them both to be as far away as was required in the Copernican theory to show no parallax, and to have the sizes seen with the telescope. The result in all cases was that the stars were huge - dwarfing the sun. In some scenarios one single star would exceed the size of the entire universe as estimated by a geocentrist like Tycho Brahe. This problem that the appearance of stars in the telescope posed for the Copernican theory had been noted as early as 1614 by Simon Marius, who said telescopic observations of the disks of stars supported the Tychonic theory. The problem was acknowledged by Copernicans such as Martin van den Hove (1605-1639), who also measured the disks of stars and acknowledged that the issue of vast star sizes might lead people to reject the Copernican theory.|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of airborne observatories, high mountain-top observatories, and space observatories designed especially for infrared and submillimeter astronomy has opened fields of research requiring new optical techniques. A typical far-IR photometric study involves measurement of a continuum spectrum in several passbands between approx 30 microns and 1000 microns and diffraction-limited mapping of the source. At these wavelengths, diffraction effects strongly influence {{the design of}} the field optics systems which couple the incoming flux to the radiation sensors (cold bolometers). The <b>Airy</b> diffraction <b>disk</b> for a typical telescope at submillimeter wavelengths approx 100 microns- 1000 microns is many millimeters in diameter; the size of the field stop must be comparable. The dilute radiation at the stop is fed through a Winston nonimaging concentrator to a small cavity containing the bolometer. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review the principles and techniques of infrared field optics systems, including spectral filters, concentrators, cavities, and bolometers (as optical elements), with emphasis on photometric systems for wavelengths longer than 60 microns...|$|R
2500|$|... where θ is {{the angular}} resolution, λ is the {{wavelength}} of the light, and D is {{the diameter of the}} lens aperture. If the angular separation of the two points is significantly less than the <b>Airy</b> <b>disk</b> angular radius, then the two points cannot be resolved in the image, but if their angular separation is much greater than this, distinct images of the two points are formed and they can therefore be resolved. Rayleigh defined the somewhat arbitrary [...] "Rayleigh criterion" [...] that two points whose angular separation is equal to the <b>Airy</b> <b>disk</b> radius (measured to first null, that is, to the first place where no light is seen) can be considered to be resolved. It can be seen that the greater the diameter of the lens or its aperture, the finer the resolution. Interferometry, with its ability to mimic extremely large baseline apertures, allows for the greatest angular resolution possible.|$|E
2500|$|Diffraction effects {{limit the}} ability for an optical {{detector}} to optically resolve separate light sources. In general, light that is passing through an aperture will experience diffraction and the best images that can be created (as described in diffraction-limited optics) appear as a central spot with surrounding bright rings, separated by dark nulls; this pattern is known as an Airy pattern, and the central bright lobe as an <b>Airy</b> <b>disk.</b> The size of such a disk is given by ...|$|E
2500|$|Two point sources {{will each}} produce an Airy pattern – see {{the photo of}} a binary star. [...] As the point sources move closer together, the {{patterns}} will start to overlap, and ultimately they will merge to form a single pattern, {{in which case the}} two point sources cannot be resolved in the image. [...] The Rayleigh criterion specifies that two point sources can be considered to be resolvable if the separation of the two images is at least the radius of the <b>Airy</b> <b>disk,</b> i.e. if the first minimum of one coincides with the maximum of the other.|$|E
2500|$|When light {{travels through}} thin clouds {{made up of}} nearly uniform sized water or aerosol {{droplets}} or ice crystals, diffraction or bending of light occurs as the light is diffracted by {{the edges of the}} particles. [...] This degree of bending of light depends on the frequency (color) of light {{and the size of the}} particles. [...] The result is a pattern of rings, which seem to emanate from the Sun, the Moon, a planet, or another astronomical object. The most distinct part of this pattern is a central, nearly white disk. This resembles an atmospheric Airy disc but is not actually an <b>Airy</b> <b>disk.</b> It is distinct from rainbows and halos, which are mainly caused by refraction.|$|E
