40|$|New {{multifocal}} phase designs {{aiming at}} expanding {{depth of focus}} in the presbyopic eye are presented. The designs consist of multiple radial or angular zones of different powers or of combined low- and high-order aberrations. Multifocal performance was evaluated {{in terms of the}} dioptric range for which the optical quality is above an appropriate threshold, as well as in terms of the area under the through-focus optical quality curves. For varying optical power designs optimal through-focus performance was found for a maximum of three to four zones. Furthermore adding more zones decreased the optical performance of the solution. <b>Angular</b> <b>zone</b> designs provided better multifocal performance (1. 95 times on average) than radial zone designs with identical number of zones and the same power range. The optimal design (angular design with three zones) surpassed by 33 % the multifocal performance of a bifocal <b>angular</b> <b>zone</b> design and by 32 % a standard multifocal phase plate with induced spherical aberration only. By using combinations of low- and high-order aberrations the through-focus range can be extended further by another 0. 5 D beyond that of the best design of varying optical power. These designs can be implemented in adaptive optics systems for testing their visual performance in subjects and converted into multifocal contact lenses, intraocular lenses, or presbyopic corneal laser ablation profiles. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

40|$|Previous {{investigators}} {{reported the}} impairment of foveal visual acuity by nearby flanking targets (contour interaction) is reduced or eliminated when acuity is measured using low contrast targets. Unlike earlier studies, we compared contour interaction for {{high and low}} contrast acuity targets using flankers at fixed angular separations, rather than at specific multiples of the acuity target’s stroke width. Percent correct letter identification was determined in 4 adult observers for computer generated, high and low contrast dark Sloan letters surrounded by 4 equal contrast flanking bars. Two low contrast targets were selected to reduce each observer’s visual acuity by 0. 2 and 0. 4 logMAR. The crowding functions measured for high and low contrast letters are very similar when percent correct letter identification is plotted against the flanker separation in min arc.

40|$|Although fish escape trajectories are linearly {{related to}} {{stimulus}} direction, they vary considerably {{after the initial}} {{turn away from the}} stimulus. Past studies of escape trajectories in fish and other animals have been analysed by employing linear plots of stimulus angle v rsusbody turning angle. Here, we define escape trajectories as a circular variable, with 0 ˚ as stimulus direction. Angelfish (Pterophyllum eimekei) escape in non-random trajectories when the stimulus is presented laterally, within an <b>angular</b> <b>zone</b> of approximately 30 – 120 ˚ (discriminating zone). The circular plot of escape trajectories shows a bimodal pattern that cannot be revealed by linear analysis. Angelfish escape preferentially at 180 ˚ and 130 ˚ away from the stimulus, maximizing the distance covered from the stimulus and escaping at the limit of their discriminating zone, respectively. Angelfish correct their responses when turning towards the stimulus, suggesting that escape trajectories are modulated by sensory feedback. Re-analysis of published work on other animals, by employing circular histograms of escape trajectories, reveals multimodal patterns which are also not apparent from the linear plots. We suggest that the presence of multiple preferred trajectories may be adaptive in preventing predators from learning any single fixed pattern of response and compensating for it...|$|E

40|$|We {{have carried}} out 3 -D {{numerical}} simulations of the dynamical bar instability in a rotating star {{and the resulting}} gravitational radiation using both an Eulerian code written in cylindrical coordinates and a smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code. The star is modeled initially as a polytrope with index n = 3 / 2 and T_ rot/|W| ≈ 0. 30, where T_ rot is the rotational kinetic energy and |W| is the gravitational potential energy. In both codes the gravitational field is purely Newtonian, and the gravitational radiation is calculated in the quadrupole approximation. We have run 3 simulations with the Eulerian code, varying the number of <b>angular</b> <b>zones</b> and {{the treatment of the}} boundary between the star and the vacuum.

40|$|The paper {{shows that}} the contour of a sheet blank at all stages of superplastic forming can be {{described}} using universal formulas known as a «superformula» Gielis and «superellipse» Lamé. The work provides information on the values range of the coefficients entering into these formulas. The paper shows the results of approximation {{by means of the}} proposed formulas of shell contours manufactured by superplastic forming by different methods. The application of the «superformula» to approximate the spherical shell contours in the first stage of molding has been tested. The graphs that show the ratio of the ordinates of the contours of the spherical shells and the hemisphere are given. It is shown that the contours of the shells from the AlMg 5 and Pb- 38 %Sn alloys are rejected {{in the direction of the}} formation of parabolas.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{the design of a}} novel {{miniaturized}} image sensor based on the working principle of insect facet eyes. The main goals are to design an imaging system which captures a large field of view (FOV) and to find a good trade-off between image resolution and sensitivity. To capture a total FOV of 124 °, we split up this FOV into 25 different zones. Each of these <b>angular</b> <b>zones</b> is imaged by an isolated optical channel on our image sensor. There is an overlap between the zones to cover the full FOV but the different zones are imaged on separated regions at the image sensor. Every optical channel in the designed component consists of two lenses that are tilted with respect to each other and the optical axis. Because of this tilt of the lenses, we are able to minimize field curvature and distortion in the obtained images at the detector, and have an angular resolution below 1 °. The optical system was implemented and optimized in the ray-tracing program ASAP. The parameters (in one channel) that are optimized to obtain this large FOV with a good image resolution and sensitivity are the radius of curvature of the two lenses, their conical factor and their tilt in two directions with respect to the optical axis of the complete system. The lenses are each placed on a pedestal that connects the lens to a planar substrate. We also add absorbing tubes that connect the two lenses in one channel to eliminate stray-light between different optical channels. The obtained image quality of the design is analyzed using our simulation model. This is determined by different parameters as there are: modulation transfer function, distortion, sensitivity, angular resolution, energy distribution in each channel and channel overlap. The modulation transfer function shows us that maximum contrast in the image is reached up to 0. 3 LP/°, distortion is maximal 21 % in one of the 25 different channels, the sensitivity is 0. 3 % and the resolution is better than 1 °.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the rotational dynamics of disk accretion around a strongly magnetized neutron star with an aligned dipole field. The magnetospheric field {{is assumed to}} thread the disk plasma {{both inside and outside}} the corotation radius. As a result of disk-star interaction, the magnetic torque on the disk affects the structure of accretion flow to yield the observed spin- up or spin- down rates for a source of given fastness, magnetic field strength, and mass accretion rate. Within the model we obtain a prescription for the dynamical viscosity of such magnetically modified solutions for a Keplerian disk. We then use this prescription to find a model solution for the rotation rate profile throughout the entire disk, including the non-Keplerian inner disk. We find that the non-Keplerian angular velocity transition region is not necessarily narrow for a source of given spin state. The boundary layer approximation, as in the standard magnetically threaded disk model, holds only in the case of dynamical viscosity decreasing all the way to the innermost edge of the disk. These results are applied to several observed disk-fed X-ray pulsars that have exhibited quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). The QPO frequencies provide a constraint on the fastness parameter and enable one to determine uniquely the width of the <b>angular</b> velocity transition <b>zone</b> for each source within model assumptions. We discuss the implications of these results on the value of the critical fastness parameter for a magnetized star in spin equilibrium.

40|$|The gas {{dynamics}} of weakly ionized protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is largely {{governed by the}} coupling between gas and magnetic fields, described by three non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) effects (Ohmic, Hall, ambipolar). Previous local simulations incorporating these processes have revealed that the inner regions of PPDs are largely laminar accompanied by wind-driven accretion. We conduct 2 D axisymmetric, fully global MHD simulations of these regions (∼ 1 - 20 AU), taking into account all non-ideal MHD effects, with tabulated diffusion coefficients and approximate treatment of external ionization and heating. With net vertical field aligned with disk rotation, the Hall-shear instability strongly amplifies horizontal magnetic field, making the overall dynamics dependent on initial field configuration. Following disk formation, the disk likely relaxes into an inner zone characterized by asymmetric field configuration across the midplane that smoothly transitions to a more symmetric outer <b>zone.</b> <b>Angular</b> momentum transport is driven by both MHD winds and laminar Maxwell stress, with both accretion and decretion flows present at different heights, and modestly asymmetric winds from the two disk sides. With anti-aligned field polarity, weakly magnetized disks settle into an asymmetric field configuration with supersonic accretion flow concentrated at one side of disk surface, and highly asymmetric winds between the two disk sides. In all cases, the wind is magneto-thermal in nature characterized by mass loss rate exceeding the accretion rate. More strongly magnetized disks give more symmetric field configuration and flow structures. Deeper far-UV penetration leads to stronger and less stable outflows. Implications for observations and planet formation are also discussed. Comment: 32 pages, 22 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
