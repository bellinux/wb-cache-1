5000|$|At {{the time}} when the term {{aeropause}} became relevant to the pursuits of mankind into the upper regions of Earth’s atmosphere, there did not exist a precise description for the word. The judgement of experts in the various fields was solicited and input was sought to define the term aeropause. The terms from aeromedical and aeronautical disciplines along with terms from geophysics, astrophysics, and radiobiology were not sufficient to depict this region of the atmosphere where human endeavors sought to venture and explore. The current terms in use were limited and insufficient. The terms available and that came under consideration were <b>aerosphere,</b> aeropause, and astronautics.According to Clayton S. White, the expression aeropause is a coined word first spoken by Dr. Konrad Buettner of the Department of Space Medicine at Randolph Field during a conference. Again, referring to White: [...] "aerosphere was visualized as that region in which flight was possible currently. The aeropause was the region just above this, to be different yesterday, today, and tomorrow, as progress in aviation ensued".|$|E

Recent technological advances in acoustic detection and in methods of analysis, coupled with the expansion of libraries of echolocation calls for species identification, now allow for the reliable quantification of species numbers and activity of the scarcely known group of aerial insectivorous bats, particularly in species-rich tropical assemblages.

40|$|The <b>aerosphere</b> is {{utilized}} by billions of birds, moving {{for different reasons}} and from short to great distances spanning {{tens of thousands of}} kilometres. The <b>aerosphere,</b> however, is also {{utilized by}} aviation creating increasing conflicts in and around airfields as well as en-route. Collisions between birds and aircraft cost billions of euros annually and, in some cases, result in the loss of human lives. Simultaneously, aviation has diverse negative impacts on wildlife. During avian migration, due to the sheer numbers of birds in the air, the risk of bird strikes becomes particularly acute especially for military aviation. Over the last few decades, air forces across Europe and the Middle East have been developing solutions that integrate ecological research and aviation policy to reduce mutual negative interactions between birds and aircraft. The aims of this study are (1) to provide a brief overview of the systems currently used in aviation to monitor bird migration movements in the <b>aerosphere,</b> (2) to estimate their impact and effectiveness in bird strike avoidance, and (3) to show the integral role of operational weather radar networks. We compare systems in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Poland and Israel, areas that are crossed twice a year by huge fluxes of Palearctic migrants. We focus mainly on en-route conflicts and migration forecast systems. In addition, we describe how civil aviation can benefit from these military developments.

40|$|To {{obtain the}} {{qualitative}} experimental data about acoustical characteristics of light propeller aircrafts is a relevant problem when conducting the full-scale tests {{at the local}} aerodrome. For such tests [1 - 3], {{it was very important}} that a desired signal level was significantly higher than the ambient background noise. In this regard, it is relevant to form a databank both of the spectral structure of <b>aerosphere</b> acoustical radiation, corresponding to the ambient background noise for various climatic zones and natural landscapes, and of the basic regularities to form an ambient background noise in a bottom layer of <b>aerosphere.</b> The article describes the authors’ developed procedure of data acquisition about a spectral structure and the procedure to form a bank of statistical data about spectral and integrated characteristics of an ambient background noise. The article provides measurements of spectral characteristics of an ambient background noise taken in conditions of local aerodrome. It shows the normalized graphical matrixes of 1 / 3 - oktave spectra of the sound pressure levels (SPL) of an ambient background noise. The paper also estimates confidence intervals to assess mathematical expectation of the spectral sound pressure levels of a background to have a reliability level of 90 % for various values of the meteorological parameters characterizing <b>aerosphere</b> condition. In the course of tests, the <b>aerosphere</b> parameters were changing within the following ranges: wind speed - 0 - 6 m/s; temperature - 8 - 30 оС; relative humidity - 30 - 59 %; air cover condition - from «clear sky» to « cumulus clouds». The obtained data allowed us to find that the acoustical radiation corresponding to the ambient background noise is broadband, within the range of frequencies of 16 - 10000 Hz. In the background noise spectra, it is possible to distinguish, at least, four frequency ranges, which have the notable characteristic frequency-changing levels of spectral components. It may be possible that these frequency ranges match to various sources (or mechanism of sound generation) of a natural origin. It is shown that even in conditions of flat ground, spectral levels of the background ambient noise can be rather unstable even in a time interval, equal to one minute, with no or low (up to 2 m/s) wind speed. And, on the contrary, a change of the spectral levels of sound pressure can be poor in a time even with increasing (up to 6 m/s) wind speed. </p...|$|E

40|$|Synopsis The {{physical}} {{environment of the}} <b>aerosphere</b> is both complex and dynamic, and poses many challenges to the locomotor systems of the three extant evolutionary lineages of flying animals. Many features of the <b>aerosphere,</b> operating over spatial and temporal scales of many orders of magnitude, {{have the potential to}} be important influences on animal flight, and much as marine ecologists have studied the relationship between physical oceanography and swimming locomotion, a subfield of aeroecology can focus attention on the ways the biology of flight is influenced by these characteristics. Airflows are altered and modulated by motion over and around natural and human-engineered structures, and both vortical flow structures and turbulence are introduced to the aerial environment by technologies such as aircraft and wind farms. Diverse aspects of the biology of flight may be better understood with reference to an aeroecological approach, particularly the mechanics and energetics of flight, the sensing of aerial flows, and the motor control of flight. Moreover, not only does the abiotic world influence the aerospheric conditions in which animals fly, but flying animals also, in turn, change the flow environment in their immediate vicinity, which can include the air through which other animals fly, particularly when animals fly in groups. Flight biologists can offer considerable insight into the ecology of the aerial world, and an aeroecological approach holds great promise for stimulating and enriching the study of the biology of flight...|$|E

The distribution distance of entangled photon pairs achieved in the experiment is {{for the first time}} well beyond the effective thickness of the <b>aerosphere,</b> hence presenting a significant step towards satellite-based global quantum communication.

40|$|Synopsis Long-distance {{migration}} of adult corn earworm moths (Helicoverpa zea), {{and several other}} noctuid moth species, facilitates seasonal expansion of pest populations and consequent increased infestations of agricultural crops on a continental scale in North America. Long-term field studies of population dynamics and migratory flights of H. zea and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) in the United States were evaluated using X-band radar observations and profiles of atmospheric conditions. These studies identified characteristic patterns of migratory flight that are largely associated with vertical profiles of temperature and wind speed. Collective patterns of moth migrations were generally highly correlated with wind headings, but often at a significant angular deviation. Preliminary analyses are presented between moth distributions in the <b>aerosphere</b> estimated from discrete moth counts using X-band radar and bulk reflectivity data from NEXRAD Doppler radar. Identification of associations between atmospheric factors and noctuid population dynamics and migratory flights will improve the ability to predict infestations by pest species throughout their broad seasonal range expansion...|$|E

40|$|Aeroecology is an {{emerging}} interdisciplinary science {{focused on the}} study of airborne organisms with the aim of deepening understanding about the ecological functions of the <b>aerosphere</b> and the bio-organisms that move through it. In addition to having important applications to the understanding of animal migration and foraging movements, global pest and disease control, biodiversity and conservation issues, and monitoring of the effects of climate change, aeroecology has also been critical in ensuring the safety of military and civilian aircraft from bird strikes. Although the capability of radar to observe bioscatter has been known for nearly 70 years, radar aeroecology has now entered an exciting new phase, with the prospect of continent-wide monitoring of flying animals by means of networks of operational weather radars.

40|$|Burkholderia pseudomallei is a {{saprophytic}} bacterium {{that causes}} melioidosis {{and is often}} isolated from rice fields in Southeast Asia, where the infection incidence is high among rice field workers.

When B. pseudomallei was exposed to surface-sterilized seeds, the growth of both the root and the <b>aerosphere</b> was retarded compared to that in controls. The organism was found to localize in the root hairs and endodermis of the plant. A biofilm formed around the root and root structures that were colonized.

Researchers have tried to substitute fly ash for cement which generally leads to lower strength. Fibers in general have been used in recent years, mainly to toughen and strengthen the concrete matrices and to enhance the shrinkage cracking resistance. However, more research is required on the mechanical and durability properties of high performance high volume flyash concrete reinforced with hybrid fibers, as very little research or experimental work is reported in the literature. This paper investigates the provision of three different fibers; steel, polypropylene and basalt in individual and in hybrid form.

40|$|Synopsis Existing {{information}} on the activity of bats in the <b>aerosphere</b> is restricted almost exclusively to altitudes that are within a few tens of meters above the ground. We report a total of 50. 2 h of ultrasonic recordings made using radio microphonic bat detectors suspended from free-floating helium balloons and from kites. The data include a total of 22 353 echolocative calls from ground-level to 1118 m above ground level (AGL). These calls are attributed to Brazilian free-tailed bats based on acoustic features and the large numbers and high-altitude aerial dispersion of these bats over the local landscape. Bat activity varied significantly throughout the air column and was greatest at 400 – 500 m AGL and near ground level. Feeding buzzes, indicating feeding on aerial prey, were most abundant near ground level and at 400 – 500 m, and were detected to altitudes of 900 m AGL. The peak activity of bats at 400 – 500 m AGL is concordant with the altitude of the atmospheric boundary layer and the seasonal formation of the low-elevation southerly wind jet that {{has been identified as}} a major aeroecological corridor for the nocturnal dispersal of noctuid moths and other insects...|$|E

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{boundary layer}} and lower free atmosphere, or <b>aerosphere,</b> is increasingly important for human transportation, communication, environmental monitoring, and energy production. The impacts of anthropogenic encroachment into aerial habitats {{are not well}} understood. Insectivorous birds and bats are inherently valuable components of biodiversity and play an integral role in aerial trophic dynamics. Many of these insectivores are experiencing range-wide population declines. As {{a first step toward}} gaging the potential impacts of these declines on the aerosphere’s trophic system, estimates of the biomass and energy consumed by aerial insectivores are needed. We developed a suite of energetics models for {{one of the largest and}} most common avian aerial insectivores in North America, the Purple Martin (Progne subis). The base model estimated that Purple Martins consumed 412 (± 104) billion insects*y- 1 with a biomass of 115, 860 (± 29, 192) metric tonnes*y- 1. During the breeding season Purple Martins consume 10. 3 (+ 3. 0) kg of prey biomass per km 3 of aerial habitat, equal to about 36, 000 individual insects*km- 3. Based on these calculations, the cumulative seasonal consumption of insects*km- 3 is greater in North America during the breeding season than during other phases of the annual cycle, however the maximum daily insect consumption*km- 3 occurs during fall migration. This analysis provides the first range-wide quantitative estimate of the magnitude of the trophic impact of this large and common aerial insectivore. Future studies could use a simila...|$|E
