60|$|A {{couple of}} days later the doctor came to the final {{conclusion}} that {{it was a case of}} typhoid, and pronounced Mr Clinton very ill. He was indeed; he lay for days, between life and death, on his back, looking at people with dull, unknowing eyes, clutching feebly at the bed-clothes. And for hours he would mutter strange things to himself so quietly that one could not hear. But at last Dame Nature and the Scotch doctor conquered the microbes, <b>and</b> <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> became better.|$|E
60|$|Now, it chanced one {{day that}} the senior partner of the firm was summoned to serve on a jury at a coroner's inquest, <b>and</b> <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton,</b> {{furnished}} with the excuse that Mr Haynes was out of town, was told to go in his stead. Mr Clinton had never performed that part of a citizen's duties, for on becoming a householder he had hit upon the expedient of being summoned for his rates, so that his name should be struck off the coroner's list; he was very indifferent to the implied dishonour. It was with some curiosity, therefore, that he repaired to the court {{on the morning of}} the inquest.|$|E

60|$|All night Mr Clinton tossed {{from side}} to side; the heat was unbearable, and he threw off the clothes. His restlessness became so great that {{he got out of}} bed and walked up and down the room--a pathetically ridiculous object in his flannel nightshirt, from which his thin legs {{protruded}} grotesquely. Going back to bed, he fell into an uneasy sleep; but waking or sleeping, he had before his eyes the faces of the three horrible bodies he had seen at the mortuary. He could not blot out the image of the thin, baby face with the pale, open eyes, the white face drawn and thin, hideous in its starved, dead shapelessness. And he saw the drawn, wrinkled face of the old man, with the stubbly beard; looking at it, he felt the long pain of hunger, the agony of the hopeless morrow. But he shuddered with terror at the thought of the drowned girl with the sunken eyes, the horrible discolouration of putrefaction; <b>and</b> <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> buried his face in his pillow, sobbing, sobbing very silently so as not to wake his wife....|$|E

40|$|One of {{the many}} curious revelations in the {{increasingly}} bizarre saga of the presidential pardon of Marc Rich in the twilight hours of the Clinton administration is especially fascinating to the student of international human rights law. Former President Clinton, in justifying the pardon, explained that Mr. Rich was an unheralded human rights activist. Among his apparently numerous, but unacknowledged, good deeds, one stands out for its carefully crafted hypocrisy. Mossad, the Israeli covert action agency, arranged for Mr. Rich secretly to transfer 400, 000 to the Egyptian government, which then established a fund to compensate the families of Israeli victims of a shooting attack by an Egyptian soldier who had run amok in a tourist area near the Egyptian-Israeli border. Thanks to Mr. Rich 2 ̆ 7 s anonymous generosity, Egypt could appear to be making voluntary payments to the families, thereby seeming to acknowledge the grave human rights violations that had occurred, while expressing Egypt 2 ̆ 7 s contrition for them. Israeli public opinion, which had been aroused by the murders, would be assuaged, while those who viewed events through a human rights lens could take satisfaction in the 2 ̆ 2 fact 2 ̆ 2 that, though horrible things continue to happen, {{the world as a}} whole is increasingly sensitive and responsive to human rights claims. We would all feel good, and only Mr. Rich, the Egyptian government, Mossad, <b>and</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> would be any the wiser...|$|E

40|$|The {{nation has}} {{undergone}} a watershed change in examining health insurance {{on a national level}} in the past two years. Many American Presidents since World War II have tried to influence the growth of health care in America. President <b>and</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> made the strongest attempt to bring about change since the Truman Era. Credibility issues surrounding costs, the spectre of government waste and control, divided opinions among the electorate, and strong political partisanship resulted in a legislative impasse. Modest market-based changes at the state level may come about over the next several years. The problem of educating young people concerning the pertinent issues in national health care policy and encouraging their involvement as citizens and employees is being addressed in management education at Cal Poly and other universities across the country...|$|R

50|$|After Mother Seton’s {{departure}} to Emmitsburg, Maryland in {{the summer}} of 1809, the house was left vacant for some time. This property served for a variety of purposes; in the late 19th century and early 20th century the home was used as a potato bin, and a place of storage and laundry services. After receiving much negative attention for its lack of upkeep, a local women’s group initiated the restoration of the home. The current owner of the property is the Sulpician Order, which also still retains control of St. Mary’s Seminary. In the process of renovation, the house was thoroughly documented by taking photos of both the interior and exterior in order to restore the home to its full originality. At the head of renovation were <b>Mrs.</b> Earnshaw <b>and</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> K. Macsherry with their consultant, John H. Scarff. They furnished the home with decor from the Federal time period. During this time, many were behind the full restoration of this home; in particular, it can be noted that the Order of the Alhambra gave $20,000 for the project.|$|R
