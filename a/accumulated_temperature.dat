40|$|Aim Temperature is an {{important}} environmental factor influencing seed germination. Our objective was to research the seed germination response of 12 Compositae species from the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China to different temperatures using the <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> model. Methods All 12 species belong to four genera of Compositae. Seeds of each species were germinated at five constant temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 °C), and germination was recorded once per day. We combined the logistic function and the <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> equation and used non-linear regression to estimate the base temperature and <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> for seed germination of each species. Important findings The average base temperature and <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> of the 12 species were 0 °C and 94. 5 °C·d, respectively. The base temperature was lower and the <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> was higher than reported by previous researchers. These {{are the result of}} long-term adaptation to the temperature environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. There was a significant negative correlation between base temperature and <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> (p = 0. 04). Therefore, species with lower base temperature would avoid the risk of seeds germinating earlier in an environment with changeable temperature. A significant positive correlation existed between seedmass and <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> (p = 0. 01). Under relatively constant base temperature, small-seeded species germinated faster than large-seeded ones, giving them priority of germination in early succession...|$|E

40|$|Abiotic and biotic {{factors have}} the {{potential}} to alter herb communities, however, few studies consider feedback between them. This study explores how variation of species interaction and climatic conditions associated with changes in altitude affect herb community composition. We sampled <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperatures</b> of growth duration (June-November) (ATGD), maximum summer temperatures (MST) and herb community composition (herb height, abundance, richness) on non-gaps and forest-gaps site across an elevational gradient. A significant negative relationship was detected between MST and herb richness. The temperature of non-gaps was cooler than that of forest gaps, and overstory cover positively correlated with herb abundance. However, the ATGD exhibited a negative relationship with overstory cover, in that overstory cover decreased with ATGD. We suggested that temperature has a profound effect on height and richness of herb communities, while the overstory cover is moderating the effect of temperature on herb community structure and influence the abundance of herb community. Conversely, decreases in ATGD weakened the relative importance of overstory cover. We concluded that the interaction of temperature and overstory cover shapes the morphology, abundance and richness of herb communities...|$|R
50|$|All {{optical fibers}} undergo some darkening {{depending}} {{on a number}} of factors that include: ionization type, optical fiber core glass composition, operating wavelength, dose rate, total <b>accumulated</b> dose, <b>temperature</b> and power propagating through the core. Since attenuation is composition dependent, it is observed that fibers having pure silica cores and fluorine down doped claddings are amongst the most radiation hard fibers. The presence of dopants in the core such as germanium, phosphorus, boron, aluminum, erbium, ytterbium, thulium, holmium etc. compromises the radiation hardness of optical fibers. To minimize damage consequences, it is better to use a pure silica core fiber at higher operating wavelength, lower dose rate, lower total <b>accumulated</b> dose, higher <b>temperature</b> (accelerated recovery) and higher signal power (photo-bleaching). In addition to these intrinsic steps, external engineering may be required to shield the fiber from the effects of radiation.|$|R

Changes in indicators for which temperature-related signals have already been observed (seasonal warming patterns, advances in high spring streamflow, decreases in snow depth, extended growing seasons, earlier bloom dates) are generally reproduced by past model simulations and are projected to continue in the future. Other indicators for which trends have not yet been observed also show projected future changes consistent with a warmer climate (shrinking snow cover, more frequent droughts, and extended low-flow periods in summer).

However, this agricultural proverb has a long history and is highly targeted in its geographical scope. <b>Accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> is one of the important indicators for judging the agricultural season, which lays the foundation for the automatic identification of farming season, but the cumulative temperature {{is only one of the}} many meteorological factors, and more factors need to be considered. Phenology is more reliable, but it is more dependent on human experience judgments; there are many limitations to achieve automatic identification.

40|$|A dynamic {{population}} model of Hyalomma marginatum, the vector of several pathogens {{in the western}} Palearctic, was developed to simulate effects of temperature and water vapour deficit (VD) on tick survival, development rates and seasonality. Base tick survival and development rates were obtained from laboratory-controlled experiments or calculated from reported data. These rates were modelled as temperature-dependant time delays or <b>accumulated</b> mortality by <b>temperature</b> and water VD stress. Using daily data derived from a gridded data set at 10 -min resolution, the model reached stable and cyclical equilibria {{in an area that}} corresponds largely with the reported distribution of the tick in western Palearctic. The model did not identify a potential range of suitable climate for the tick out of the known distribution area, implying that under current climate conditions, there is no potential to spread at the spatial scale of the model. Tick die-out at northern latitudes was attributed to a steady increase in duration of the development rates of engorged nymphs to adults and hence increased mortality in this stage. Low developmental rates in northern latitudes produced the accumulation of most of the nymphal stock in late summer and early autumn, which cannot moult to adults because of the low temperatures of late autumn and winter. The tick did not produced selfsustained populations in areas where yearly <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperatures</b> were below 3000 – 4000 C, a limit roughly found at latitudes north of 47 ºN. Tick die-out in sites southern to 34 ºN was attributed to the mortality rates of engorged nymphs, which moult in late spring and summer, in the season where temperatures and water vapour stresses were highest. These findings and future applications of the model in investigating the dynamics of pathogens potentially transmitted by H. marginatum are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Deconstructive {{metamorphosis}} {{begins as}} the snow makes {{its way to the}} ground often melting, refreezing, and settling. Water molecules become reordered causing the snowflakes to become more spherical in appearance. These melting snowflakes fuse with others around them becoming larger until all are uniform in size. While the snow is on the ground the melting and joining of snow flakes reduces the height of snowpack by shrinking air spaces and causing the density and mechanical strength of the snowpack to increase. Freshly fallen snow with a density of 0.1 g/cm3 has very good insulating properties; however as time goes on, due to destructive metamorphism the insulating property of the snowpack decreases because the air spaces between snowflakes disappear. Snow that has been residing on the ground {{for a long period of}} time has an average density of 0.40 g/cm3 and conducts heat well; however, once a base of 50 cm of snow with a density around 0.3 g/cm3 has <b>accumulated,</b> <b>temperatures</b> under the snow remain relatively constant because the greater depth of snow compensates for its density. Destructive metamorphosis is a function of time, location, and weather. It occurs at a faster rate with higher temperatures, in the presence of water, under larger temperature gradients (e.g., warm days followed by cold nights), at lower elevations and on slopes that receive large amounts of solar radiation. As time goes on snow settles compacting air spaces, a process expedited by the packing force of the wind.|$|R
