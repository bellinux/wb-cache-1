2500|$|The radical MP William Cobbett {{voted against}} the Act, asserting that the poor had an <b>automatic</b> right to <b>relief</b> and that the Act aimed to [...] "enrich the landowner" [...] {{at the expense of}} the poor. The 'Tory Radical' Richard Oastler {{personally}} lobbied Tory leaders (including the Duke of Wellington) to oppose the Act.

[...] Oastler told the Duke [...] "if that Bill passes, the man who can produce the greatest confusion in the country will be the greatest patriot, and I will try to be that man". [...] However the Duke was unconvinced; Tory landowners were as keen on reducing poor rates as were the Whigs, and the Bill received little opposition from either the House of Commons or the House of Lords before gaining Royal Assent. [...] John Fielden, an industrialist and owner of textile mills at Todmorden and MP for Oldham (where he had secured Cobbett's election) was like Cobbett a strong opponent of the New Poor Law, and after Cobbett's death was part of a small group of MPs who called for review of the working of the Act - Fielden further called for its repeal [...] -: all that was achieved was a Select Committee which took most of its evidence from the Poor Law Commission and other Poor Law functionaries and consequently found much to praise and little to blame.|$|R

40|$|The Royal Commission on Ancient and Historic Monuments for Scotland (RCAHMS) {{are obliged}} to record Historical Monuments and to make this {{information}} available to the public. The traditional method of relief representation within archaeology employs ‘hachures ’ (a hachure being a hand drawn line {{along the line of}} steepest gradient of a slope and in the direction of that slope). With the development of GIS within RCAHMS this data has to be digitally accessible. This research reports on a method for <b>automatic</b> <b>relief</b> representation (archaeological features such as ramparts and mound) required in order to visualise archaeological monuments within a GIS. The need for automated relief representation arose because current methods for the representation of monument sites as points or lines is not adequate and an automated process was necessary in terms of time and economic efficiency. Furthermore alternatives to hatchuring (such as contours, relief shading and DTMs) proved ineffective at showing the subtle morphological changes that typically define earth works and boundaries to ancient monuments. In this paper we report on an automated hachure process, developed in C, and embedded in the GenaMap GIS. The C program takes as input the isolines defining {{the top and bottom of}} the slope and ‘drops ’ hachures between these contours.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, Australia’s {{migration}} program has evolved. It has {{transformed from a}} program to source labour into a tool which supplements our skill base and imports knowledge. It has become less permanent but more responsive; less centrally set and more demand driven. At {{the heart of this}} transformation is the growth of temporary skilled migration. Approximately 190, 000 temporary migrants now live and work in Australia as primary and secondary 457 visa holders. To put this in perspective, the total number of 457 visa holders currently in Australia is now roughly equal to the annual intake under our permanent migration program, but {{only a fraction of the}} total number of the 1. 2 million temporary migrants residing in Australia at any one time. The 457 visa program is a purpose-built labour market policy tool and part of a new era of people movement management. A growing portion of the permanent program comprises employer-sponsored migrants. Of these permanent migrants, more than 70 per cent of those sponsored already reside in Australia on temporary 457 work visas. This is the newest policy advancement, a two-step migration process, allowing demand to drive the flow of skills into our labour force. The growth of temporary skilled migration means we now have two “migration programs” to address skills shortages that are tied together and inextricably linked: the 457 program and the permanent skilled migration program. Temporary skilled migration has become an <b>automatic</b> <b>relief</b> valve, cushioning the relationship between labour market needs and the time lag inherent to centrally planned permanent migration. Surges in skilled labour requirements or dips in economic activity see numbers of temporary skilled workers ebb and flow. The program helps to maintain Australia’s international competitiveness and is critical to our aspirations to become a regional hub.  Temporary skilled migration has received extensive media coverage and political attention in the almost two decades since the 457 visa was first introduced. Interest in the program reflects the inherent tension in providing a flexible and responsive tool to assist business in accessing the skilled labour they require to satisfy Australia’s labour and economic needs, and enhance our international competitiveness, while also protecting Australian workers, their jobs, training and conditions. In particular there have been periodic reports of exploitation of overseas workers and rorting of aspects of the program by employers.  ...|$|E
40|$|Australia 2 ̆ 7 s {{interest}} rates {{are close to the}} highest among all developed countries. IAN McAULEY looks at the implications "WOTCHER gonna do 2 ̆ 7 bout 2 ̆ 7 ousin?" a lady screamed at Bob Menzies in a 1960 s town hall election rally. "I 2 ̆ 7 d put an 2 ̆ 7 h 2 ̆ 7 in front of it" was his prompt reply. In such situations a quick wit is a good substitute for considered policy. Forty years on, we are still groping for practical solutions to housing affordability. There are many factors driving the price of housing and therefore housing stress, including land servicing costs (which are now borne by the purchaser rather than the wider community), distortions in the taxation system which encourage housing speculation, immigration, geographic limits on urban expansion and demand fed by government grants and inheritances. In this article, however, I want to focus on one rarely-considered factor contributing to housing stress - the effect of behavioural changes in response to mortgage {{interest rates}}. Australians place a high value on housing. While we may, say, choose a 20, 000 car rather than a 30, 000 car, in housing we tend to go for what we can afford, using a decision rule such as what we can afford if mortgage servicing takes up 25 percent of our income. There {{is no question that the}} high mortgage interest rates of the late 1980 s limited housing affordability. In 1989, Peter Costello likes reminding us, variable mortgage rates peaked at 17. 0 percent. Let’s see what effect that high rate had on a couple, each earning the average adult wage at the time (26, 611), taking out a mortgage over 20 years. If they devoted 25 per cent of their combined income to their mortgage they could afford to commit 13, 306 a year, which would service a mortgage of 74, 880 in 1989 prices, or around 129, 000 in 2007 prices. If the same couple were buying a house now, their mortgage interest rate would be only 8. 05 percent, and the adult wage is now 55, 920. Applying the same “ 25 per cent of income” decision-rule, they could afford to spend 27, 960 a year on their mortgage, which can service a mortgage of 273, 000. In real terms, that’s more than twice the value of what they could have afforded in 1989. While some effect is due to higher real wages (which have risen by about 20 per cent over that period), most is due to lower interest rates. So far, this analysis confirms the conventional wisdom: lower interest rates result in greater housing affordability. Let’s look at that “ 25 percent of income” rule, however. It is based on our capacity to make immediate repayments. But a mortgage stretches out over many years and, if we were truly rational beings blessed with perfect foresight, we would weigh up our capacity for repayment over the period of the mortgage, taking into account our expected earnings over that period. The 1980 s were a time of high inflation, which was feeding into prices and wages. Interest rates (what economists call “nominal” interest rates because these are the rates “nominated” in loan documents and everyday language) may have been high, but so too was inflation. The mortgage may have imposed an immediate 25 percent burden, but if wages were rising at 8 per cent a year, while the mortgage stayed constant, that burden would fall to 23 per cent after a year, 21 percent after two years, 20 per cent after three years, and so on. (In fact, those who took variable-rate mortgages in the late 1980 s peak soon found not only their incomes rising but also the interest rates falling.) The burden of mortgage repayment was heavy initially, but it soon lightened. We have many means of coping with temporary stress, such as deferring replacement of cars, furnishing and appliances, deferring having children and extending credit card debt. Coming forward to the present time, inflation is low, and people cannot expect such <b>automatic</b> <b>relief.</b> Even if their employment is reasonably secure, they cannot expect their income to rise much higher than inflation, which is now running at only 2. 4 per cent a year. The burden of high mortgage repayments will hang around much longer than for their predecessors, thirty years earlier. The struggle lasts longer, and, for many, the prospect of falling back to one income is unthinkable. Economists will recognise that what is being referred to in this article is the effect of real, as opposed to nominal interest rates. Nominal rates are those we see everyday, in the advertisements of banks and other lenders. Real rates take into account inflation. The relationship is mathematically simple: 	Real rates = nominal rates minus inflation. So, in 1989, when nominal rates were 17 per cent, inflation was 8 per cent, real rates were around 9 per cent [see note 1]. Now, with nominal mortgage rates around 8 per cent, and inflation at around 2 per cent, the real rate is more like 6 per cent. There has been a fall, but not of the magnitude we hear in the political debates, and, unlike 1989, there is now no prospect of an immediate fall in rates. (By 1991 rates had fallen by 4 per cent; as inflation fell, nominal interest rates also fell.) For political reasons Peter Costello and others in the government don’t talk about real rates, which have moved in a band of about 2 to 10 per cent over the last thirty years - not a very exciting political story. And Labor seems to be reluctant to go forth with any messages with the slightest suggestion of economic complexity. Certainly no one would advocate a return to high inflation as a way of easing the burden of mortgage re-payments, even though it would be effective in the short run. Rather, we need some way to moderate those decision rules based on immediate repayment - which are being stretched beyond 25 percent to even more onerous figures such as 30 percent. Certainly, it would be useful to cover the concepts of real and nominal interest rates in school and financial literacy programs, but there are many parties, besides politicians, who want to keep us thinking in nominal terms. Employers wouldn’t want to see their offers of wage rises discounted to real terms, and neither would union officials, who want to be able to boast about the rises they negotiate for their members. [2] Research in behavioural economicsshows that education, in itself, only partially improves decision-making. Behavioural economists find that we are very myopic in our decisions to borrow. In the 1980 s such myopia didn’t matter much; it was compensated for, as rising nominal wages eroded the burden of a nominally fixed mortgage. That compensation is now very much attenuated, and the mortgage burden we bear this year will be with us for many years to come. Patterns of consumer behaviour are hard to change, particularly when people are surrounded by the din of financial institutions and “innovative” lenders selling mortgages, and when politicians are boasting about low interest rates. The reality is that Australia’s {{interest rates are}} now on a steep upward trajectory, and are close to the highest among all developed countries. It may be more fruitful to search for solutions on the supply side. Some have suggested fiscal reform, such as abolishing “negative gearing,” reverting to the previous neutral capital gains tax regime, extending the jurisdiction of the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority to cover non-bank lenders, and abolishing the double counting of interest and depreciation in housing investment. Another possible area of reform is prohibition of the practice of commission-based selling, whereby the employees or agents of financial institutions are paid on a percentage of the loans they sell. This practice, as Louise Sylvan said when she was CEO of the Australian Consumers Association, is a form of “structural corruption”, resulting in over-commitment by borrowers, housing price inflation, and, as we are starting to see, concerns about the stability of our financial markets. • Ian McCauley lectures in public sector finance at the University of Canberra and is a Centre for Policy Development Fellow. Notes: 1. The actual formula is a little more complex. The real rate is (1 +nominal rate) /(1 +inflation) - 1, but that approximates to the simplified form nominal - inflation. In 1989 the nominal rate was 17. 0 percent and inflation was 8. 0 percent, giving a more precise real rate of 8. 3 percent. 2. Keynes’ solution to the stagnation of the Great Depression was to give a large nominal wage rise, but which was a cut in real terms. Seventy years later people have learned how to adjust wages for inflation, but they have not applied the same learning to interest rates. Photo: Andrew Jeffre...|$|E
