Field education is recognised as pivotal in preparing <b>social</b> <b>work</b> students for professional practice. <b>As</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> practitioners, organisations and <b>social</b> <b>work</b> educators are exposed to external and internal pressures, <b>social</b> <b>work</b> practice learning with off-site supervision is becoming more prevalent. This paper reports on research that explored the experiences of key stakeholders in <b>social</b> <b>work</b> practice learning with external or, in other words, off-site supervision. This paper explores the experiences of university liaison persons who provided supported field education arrangements with off-site supervision. A range of themes have emerged, including reflections about bringing the university to the placement experience, creating student centred placement opportunities, the complexity of connecting the various players and the extra support and resources needed to support placements with off-site supervision. Findings suggest that quality learning experiences are about more than modes of supervision, that placements with off-site supervision increase the workload of liaison persons and that clear models and structures {{need to be developed}} to support emerging field education models...|$|R
