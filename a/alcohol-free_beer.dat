40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{preparation}} and characterization of <b>alcohol-free</b> <b>beers</b> with different flavours. Five flavoured and four pure, commercially available beers were tested. Three <b>alcohol-free</b> <b>beers</b> were then selected {{and used for}} preparation of flavoured beers. Ingredients used for production of flavour were honey, raspberry, ginger and cranberry. Analysis was focused mainly on substances of phenolic nature. Flavoured beers were also tested in sensory analysis. Ingredients used for flavouring of beers and production of both alcoholic and <b>alcohol-free</b> <b>beers</b> are described in theoretical part of the thesis. Analysis of polyphenols, flavonoids, technological characteristics and anthocyanins was performed using spectrophotometric method. Phenolic substances were identified and quantified by HPLC/PDA. Ascorbic acid was analysed by HPLC-NH 2 /UV. Results proved an increase of polyphenols, ascorbic acid and anthocyanins during flavouring of <b>alcohol-free</b> <b>beers</b> in dependence of used ingredients. Sensory analysis showed that as the best rated was the Staropramen beer with raspberry flavour. On the contrary, flavoured Bernard beers were poorly rated...|$|R

40|$|<b>Alcohol-free</b> <b>beers</b> {{are usually}} {{characterized}} by worty off-flavors {{and the lack}} of the pleasant fruity or ester aroma found in regular beers. Enhancing yeast reduction of 3 -methylthiopropionaldehyde, 3 -methylbutanal, and 2 -methylbutanal appears to be a good means of improving the organoleptic quality of <b>alcohol-free</b> <b>beers.</b> Upon screening of various Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts for in vitro reductase activity, a haploid adh 0 strain emerged as the most efficient yeast for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced form) (NADPH) -dependent Strecker aldehyde reduction. Tetrad analysis of diploids (adh 0 x 15 D wild-type) demonstrated the predominant role of adh 1 mutation to enhance aldehyde reductase. Consequent to such alcohol dehydrogenase gene disruption, acetaldehyde accumulates, although partly oxidized into acetic acid by the NADP cofactor. We propose that regeneration of this cofactor in adh 1 strains can be improved by promoting NADPH-dependent aldehyde reductase activity...|$|R

40|$|Although {{much more}} {{efficient}} at 28 degrees C than at low temperature, enzymatic removal of Strecker aldehydes by brewer's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is always limited to 60 - 85 % of the: initial concentration, whatever the fermentation conditions.

A total of 7 herbal extracts were prepared and added into 3 non-alcoholic Czech beers. Each variant was examined in order to detect changes of the content of active substances before and after the addition of the herbal extract. The content of polyphenols, flavonoids, bitter substances and iso-bitter acids as well as antioxidant activity were analyzed spectrophotometrically.

40|$|<b>Alcohol-free</b> <b>beers</b> {{are usually}} criticized for two major defects: {{a lack of}} fruity aroma and a strong worty flavor. 3 -Methylbutanal and 2 -methylbutanal are {{described}} in the literature as being predominantly responsible for the worty taste. Although detected in large amounts in most malt and wort extracts, both compounds have proven unable to confer worty taste to beers. In this work, we extracted volatiles from wort with a Likens-Nickerson microextractor. The resulting extract had a strong worty aroma. Following GC/MS and GC/olfactometry analysis, 3 -methylthiopropionaldehyde {{turned out to be}} the key feature since it remained the most organoleptically active compound through extract dilution. In vitro assays showed that 3 -methylthiopropionaldehyde is a substrate for several Saccharomyces cerevisiae reducing enzymes. Screening of various strains led us to conclude that the higher the 3 -methylbutanal reductase activity, the higher the 3 -methylthiopropionaldehyde reductase activity. Monitoring of 3 -methylthiopropionaldehyde concentration through an in vivo cold contact process has also been undertaken...|$|R
40|$|Most {{reports on}} {{carbohydrates}} in beer deal with sensory and technological properties.

The aim of this work {{was to determine the}} DF and compounds associated with the fiber matrix in lager, dark, and <b>alcohol-free</b> <b>beers.</b> A specific procedure that included treatment with digestive enzymes, dialysis, acidic hydrolysis, and cellulase hydrolysis was used. Results showed that the beer contained a quantitatively important DF complex (1. 3 - 3. 8 g/L) made up of indigestible polysaccharides, polyphenolic compounds, and a minor amount of protein. Analysis of polyphenols and antioxidant activity using 2, 2 ′-azinobis(3 -azinobis(3 - ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulfonate)) (ABTS) and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays in beer and dialysis retentates revealed that {{a significant portion of the}} total polyphenols in the beer (17 - 44 %) was associated with DF, which might affect their bioavailability and metabolism. © 2009 American Society of Brewing Chemists, Inc.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1970 s, The Netherlands did not limit the alcohol {{consumption}} of road users. In late 1974, a legal limit of 0. 5 pm came into force, {{the police were}} given breathalyser equipment to test suspected drivers, and the blood alcohol content (BAC) test was admitted as legal. Some national campaigns against drink-driving were introduced. These measures were very effective for about a year, {{but most of the}} improvement did not last. After late 1987, breath testing carrying evidential weight was gradually introduced, and the proportion of drivers found with BAC more than 0. 5 pm decreased steadily. This is attributed to several specific policy measures from 1984 on, and to the growing popularity of low-alcohol and <b>alcohol-free</b> <b>beers</b> from 1989 on. To discover whether drink-driving can be reduced at a realistic level of police enforcement, the Leyden area was subjected to an enforcement experiment from late 1988 to late 1989. A large-scale enforcement and publicity campaign in the province of North Brabant, conducted from November 1989 to February 1990, was also evaluated. The results showed that intensive random alcohol controls by the police can significantly decrease the alcohol consumption of road users...|$|R

40|$|The purine {{contents}} of commercial, low-alcohol and <b>alcohol-free</b> <b>beers</b> were determined. Four gout sufferers were studied under controlled conditions {{before and after}} ingestion of four different beverages containing alcohol, alcohol and purine, purine and neither alcohol nor purine. The results show {{a significant increase in}} purine excretion with a fluid load alone and impairment or reversal of this response with the other three beverages. These results are difficult to interpret {{on the basis of the}} alcohol and purine {{contents of}} the beverages alone. Isohumulones are present in all beers.

40|$|Abstract Background Ever since Gay-Lussac's time, the {{alcoholic}} strength by volume (% vol) {{has been determined}} by using densimetric measurements. The typical reference procedure involves distillation followed by pycnometry, which is comparably labour-intensive and therefore expensive. At present, infrared (IR) spectroscopy in combination with multivariate regression is widely applied as a screening procedure, which allows one to determine alcoholic strength in less than 2 min without any sample preparation. The disadvantage is the relatively large investment for Fourier transform (FT) IR or near-IR instruments, {{and the need for}} matrix-dependent calibration. In this study, we apply a much simpler device consisting of a patented multiple-beam infrared sensor in combination with a flow-through cell for automated alcohol analysis, which is available in a portable version that allows for on-site measurements. Results During method validation, the precision of the infrared sensor was found to be equal to or better than densimetric or FTIR methods. For example, the average repeatability, as determined in 6 different wine samples, was 0. 05 % vol and the relative standard deviation was below 0. 2 %. Accuracy was ensured by analyzing 260 different alcoholic beverages in comparison to densimetric or FTIR results.

40|$|Background and aims: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} moderate alcohol consumption on lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2 activity, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress and whether these effects are modified by BMI. Methods and results: Eleven lean (BMI: 18. 5 - 25 kg/m 2) and 9 overweight (BMI > 27 kg/m 2) men participated in a randomized controlled crossover trial. After consuming 3 cans of beer (40 g ethanol) or <b>alcohol-free</b> <b>beer</b> daily during 3 weeks, fasting blood samples were taken. HDL cholesterol increased by 18. 2 % (p < 0. 001) after beer compared to <b>alcohol-free</b> <b>beer,</b> while LDL cholesterol decreased by 7. 8 % (p = 0. 008). Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2 activity was not different (p = 0. 23) between beer (47. 5 ± 0. 8) and <b>alcohol-free</b> <b>beer</b> (48. 9 ± 0. 8). High-sensitive C-reactive protein was unaffected, but urinary isoprostanes tended to increase (p = 0. 09) after beer (114. 0 ± 6. 9) compared to <b>alcohol-free</b> <b>beer</b> (96. 9 ± 6. 5). An interaction between BMI and treatment (p < 0. 05) on liver enzymes was observed, indicating an increase of liver enzymes after moderate alcohol consumption in overweight men only.
