25|$|Like intuitionism, constructivism {{involves}} the regulative principle that only mathematical entities {{which can be}} explicitly constructed in <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense</b> should be admitted to mathematical discourse. In this view, mathematics is an exercise of the human intuition, not a game played with meaningless symbols. Instead, it is about entities that we can create directly through mental activity.

40|$|Abstract:- A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} contains many sensor nodes in <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sensing</b> area. Every sensor node consists of a central processing unit, transmitting unit, receiving unit and power supply unit. In order to have efficient sensed messages, both the base station and sensor nodes have to communicate for each others as well. Therefore, <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sensing</b> area is divided into many sub-areas and every sensor node transmits its message to cluster head which, normally, will integrate and forward these messages to the base station. At the first step, set-up phase is applied to form clusters and to select cluster heads. During the second phase, the transmission phase, every sensor node received a message from another node has to transmit a confirmed message, acknowledgement (ACK), to ensure {{whether or not the}} data has been received which means every sensor node will dissipate much energy on transmitting and receiving. However, this paper proposes an adaptive routing protocol called Non_Ack in the Ad-hoc {{wireless sensor network}}s that is the data for every sensor node is transmitted directly to the cluster head and then forwards back to the base station. Some conditions for these sensor nodes with the sensed data directly transmitted without any acknowledgement may be failed so that this paper also considers as nodes fail to transmit the data back, the base station will be taken over for the network. By the consideration of these failure nodes, the base station will establish a binary tree for fault tolerance. A binary tree in the base station is also a big help for query-based routing protocol.

500|$|To Stanford's regret, many of {{his pupils}} who {{achieved}} eminence as composers broke away from his classical, Brahmsian precepts, as he had himself rebelled against Reinecke's conservatism. The composer George Dyson wrote, [...] "In <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense</b> the very rebellion he fought was the most obvious fruit of his methods. And in view of what some of these rebels have since achieved, {{one is tempted to}} wonder whether there is really anything better a teacher can do for his pupils than drive them into various forms of revolution." [...] The works of some of Stanford's pupils, including Holst and Vaughan Williams, entered the general repertory in Britain, and to some extent elsewhere, as Stanford's never did. For many years after his death it seemed that Stanford's greatest fame would be as a teacher. Among his achievements at the RCM was the establishment of an opera class, with at least one operatic production every year. From 1885 to 1915 there were 32 productions, all of them conducted by Stanford.|$|E

And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{historian}} Matthew Gordon, Ibn Tulun's relations with, and quest for autonomy from, the Abbasids is a [...] "central problem of Tulunid history". Modern scholars see in Ibn Tulun's policies a [...] "careful balancing act" [...] and {{notice that he}} never fully severed himself from the Caliphate, remaining conspicuously loyal to the person of al-Mu'tamid, who, after all, was a powerless figurehead. Nevertheless, the move towards increasing autonomy is evident throughout his reign. His relations with the Abbasid government were dominated by his conflict with al-Muwaffaq, resulting from the latter's attempts to establish control over Egypt—whose wealth was direly needed during the costly war against the Zanj—and prevent the further rise of Ibn Tulun. In <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense,</b> writes Matthew Gordon, many of Ibn Tulun's measures [...] "were as much {{the means by which}} imperial interests were protected against the ambitions of al-Muwaffaq and his (largely Turkish) military coterie in Iraq as they were efforts to secure Tulunid authority". Given that Ibn Tulun at least twice (in 871 and 875/6) remitted huge sums to the caliphal treasury, it remains an open question whether without the conflict with al-Muwaffaq, this would have been a more regular occurrence.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{response}} by Robert van Voren, Pekhterev {{in his article}} condescendingly argues that the Serbsky Institute was not so bad place and that Nekipelov exaggerates and slanders it, but Pekhterev, by doing so, misses the main point: living conditions in the Serbsky Institute were not bad, those who passed through psychiatric examination there were in <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense</b> [...] "on holiday" [...] {{in comparison with the}} living conditions of the Gulag; and all the same, everyone was aware that the Serbsky Institute was more than the [...] "gates of hell" [...] from where people were sent to specialized psychiatric hospitals in Chernyakhovsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Kazan, Blagoveshchensk, and that is not all. Their life was transformed to unimaginable horror with daily tortures by forced administration of drugs, beatings and other forms of punishment. Many went crazy, could not endure what was happening to them, some even died during the [...] "treatment" [...] (for example, a miner from Donetsk Alexey Nikitin). Many books and memoirs are written about the life in the psychiatric Gulag and every time when reading them a shiver seizes us. The Soviet psychiatric terror in its brutality and targeting the mentally ill as the most vulnerable group of society had nothing on the Nazi euthanasia programs. The punishment by placement in a mental hospital was as effective as imprisonment in Mordovian concentration camps in breaking persons psychologically and physically. The recent history of the USSR should be given a wide publicity to immunize society against possible repetitions of the Soviet practice of political abuse of psychiatry. The issue remains highly relevant.|$|E

500|$|The Chinese warlord General Henry Chang (Warner Oland) in the 1932 film Shanghai Express, who is {{presented}} as being not only as Eurasian, but as having a menacing asexuality that places him outside of the conventionally defined world of Western sexuality and racial order, making him as dangerous to the Western characters who he has taken hostage {{as much as the}} fact that he is a vicious warlord. Though Chang is Eurasian, he takes pride in his Chinese heritage while rejecting his American heritage, which confirms his Eastern identity. War-torn China, circa 1931 {{is presented}} as a [...] "hell", which a diverse group of Westerners must travel through on a nightmarish train trip from Beijing to Shanghai, which takes a turn for the worse when the train is hijacked by Chang and his men. The film strongly hints that Chang is bisexual, who not only wants to rape the heroine Shanghai Lily (Marlene Dietrich), but also the hero Captain Donald [...] "Doc" [...] Harvey (Clive Brook). When the German opium smuggler Erich Baum (Gustav von Seyffertitz) insults Chang, the result is a scene where the warlord commits a symbolic rape, as the sadistic Chang clearly takes sexual pleasure in branding Baum with a red-hot poker. After he is branded (the symbol of slavery), the once proud Baum becomes notably cowed and submissive towards Chang who in <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense</b> now [...] "owes" [...] him , which reflected the ultimate Yellow Peril fear of Westerners becoming the slaves of the East and its perverted sexuality. Later on, Chang does actually rape Hui Fei (Anna May Wong). Gina Marchetti suggests that Chang's desire to blind Harvey is not only meant literally, but is also a metaphor for castration, which even under the more permissive Production code in effect in 1932 would have been a taboo subject. In a marked contrast to Chang's twisted sexuality and his [...] "almost effeminate polish" [...] , the British Army Captain Harvey is a resolutely heterosexual, ruggedly tough soldier with a deep romantic streak who more than amply proved his manliness in the trenches of World War I, presenting a model of Western masculinity and strength.|$|E
