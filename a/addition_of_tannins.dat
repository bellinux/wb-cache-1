40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{influence}} of 9 winemaking technologies (traditional, delestage, saign´ee, delayed punching-down, addition of grape seed tannins, addition of ellagic-skin-seed tannins, heating of must-wine, cryo-maceration, and prolongedmaceration) on the phenolic content and antioxidant activity of Primitivo musts and wines. Three methods for the determination of the antioxidant activity were compared: DPPH, β-carotene bleaching assay, and ABTS. Oenological parameters and composition of the phenolic fraction of 1 -y-aged wines was also determined. The <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> allowed the increase of the phenolic content of musts and wines in a greater amount than the other technologies. The results concerning the antioxidant activity depended on themethod applied. Concerning musts, the DPPH assay did not highlight great differences among technologies, whereas the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> allowed the obtainment of the highest antioxidant activity according to β-carotene and ABTS assays. The wine aging determined an increase of the antioxidant activity, independently on the method applied. Wine obtained through traditional technology, saignee, and <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> showed the highest antioxidant activities according to DPPH and β-carotene. The highest correlation coefficients (0. 961 and 0. 932) were calculated between phenolic content and ABTS values of musts whereas the lowest values (0. 413 and 0. 517) were calculated between phenolic content and ABTS values of wines. Wines produced through traditional technology were the richest in anthocyanins. The <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> allowed to obtain high content in monomeric anthocyanins, flavonoids, flavans reactive to vanillin, and coumaroylated malvidin and a low content in acetylated malvidin...|$|E
40|$|Anticorrosion {{potential}} of mangrove tannins on aluminium alloys AA 6061 in NaCl solution {{has been studied}} using potentiodynamic polarisation method and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The study {{was carried out in}} different pH of corrosive medium in the absence and presence of various concentrations of tannin. The corrosion inhibition behaviour of the mangrove tannin on AA 6061 aluminium alloy corrosion was found to be dependant on the pH of NaCl solution. Our results showed that the inhibition efficiency increased with increasing tannins concentration in chloride solution at pH 6. Treatment of aluminium alloy 6061 with all concentrations of mangrove tannins reduced the current density, thus decreased the corrosion rate. Tannins behaved as mixed inhibitors at pH 6 and reduction in current density predominantly affected in cathodic reaction. Meanwhile, at pH 12, <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> shifted the corrosion potential to more cathodic potentials and a passivating effect was observed in anodic potentials.

Fifty lactating Holstein cows, fed two diets different for lucerne silage treatment (C or T), were used in a cross-over design. In situ rumen soluble protein fraction (%CP) was higher for C (67. 9 vs 59. 4; P< 0. 01), whereas potentially rumen degradable protein (%CP) was lower (24. 5 vs 32. 1 for C and T; P< 0. 01).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{influence}} of different winemaking technologies on the chemical characteristics and, in particular, on the phenolic fraction of Aglianico, Montepulciano, Nero di Troia and Sangiovese wines produced in Apulia, Southern Italy. Four different winemaking technologies were compared: control (traditional, 5 days of maceration at 25 °C with three daily punching-down), prolonged maceration (10 days), addition of ellagic tannins, and cryomaceration (24 h at 5 °C using dry ice), without any other oenological treatment. Results showed that the different technologies slightly influenced the phenolic fraction of Aglianico, which is known to be naturally rich of phenols. On the contrary, the prolonged maceration led to an increase of total phenols (TP) in Nero di Troia (2592 mg/kg versus 2115 mg/kg of control) and a decrease in Sangiovese (869 mg/kg versus 1013 mg/kg); the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> led to an increase of TP in Montepulciano (1358 mg/kg versus 1216 mg/kg) and to a decrease in Sangiovese (916 mg/kg versus 1013 mg/kg); cryomaceration led to a decrease of anthocyans in all cultivars (about 15 %).

2500|$|Tannins {{are found}} in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be {{introduced}} to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannin</b> powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations <b>of</b> <b>tannins,</b> known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability.

The extracted tannins were added to a soybean meal (SBM) containing diet and the ME content of this diet was compared with that of the same diet without added tannins. Results showed that removing the tannins from RSM significantly increased the ME value of the RSM for chicks from 1, 171 to 1, 844 kcal. per kg. and from 1, 253 to 1, 766 kcal. per kg. when the determinations were done at 2 weeks and 6 weeks of age respectively. <b>Addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> extracted from RSM to SBM resulted in a reduction in its ME value.

40|$|Kauri (Agathis australis (D. Don) Lindl.) occurs {{naturally}} {{in the warm}} temperate forest of northern New Zealand where it grows mixed with angiosperm tree species. Below mature kauri trees thick organic layers develop in which large amounts of nitrogen are accumulated. This nitrogen seems to be inaccessible to plants. While litter quality can explain the low decomposition rate below kauri, {{it is not known}} what causes the accumulation of nitrogen. We hypothesised that kauri tannins reduce nitrogen mineralisation and litter decomposition below kauri. We further hypothesised that high tannin concentrations in the soil would increase the availability of dissolved organic nitrogen relative to the availability of inorganic nitrogen. To test these hypotheses a laboratory incubation was carried out for 1 year. Purified tannins of kauri and of two other common New Zealand tree species were added to samples of the soil organic layer from under a kauri tree. The results suggest that during the first month of incubation the added tannins reduced nitrogen availability by sequestering proteins or by stimulating nitrogen immobilisation. In the long-term, the reduced nitrogen release, which was found following tannin addition, seems attributable to the complexation of proteins by tannins. It further appeared that the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> did not change the ratio of dissolved organic nitrogen to inorganic nitrogen in the long-term.

40|$|The <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> {{exogenous}} <b>tannins</b> {{has become}} a common practice in cool climate winemaking to increase tannin content in hybrid red wines.

With later additions, there was a progressive increase in retention for all cultivars, suggesting that adding tannin after alcoholic fermentation reduces the portion lost. Mass balance calculations also showed that 5 - 10 times more tannin was lost in the lees between post alcoholic fermentation (AF) and post malolactic fermentation (MLF) samples than following MLF through eight months of aging. This suggests that in the hybrid red cultivars studied, later <b>additions</b> <b>of</b> exogenous <b>tannin</b> increase condensed tannin retention to levels comparable to that in V. vinifera. The recommend dosage for exogenous <b>tannins</b> <b>of</b> 50 - 500 mg/L may not effectively increase condensed tannins. In 2013, wines were made from Maréchal Foch, Corot noir, and Cabernet Franc to compare the retention <b>of</b> exogenous <b>tannins</b> in interspecific hybrids and Vitis vinifera. After analyzing 12 commercial tannin products for condensed tannin concentration via HPLC, the highest, with a concentration 38 %, was added at a rate of 400, 800, and 1200 mg/L after crush/before yeast inoculation. A separate portion of each cultivar was pressed off the skins immediately, fermented with 1600 mg/L <b>of</b> exogenous <b>tannin,</b> then back-blended postfermentation with a control wine for a final theoretical concentration <b>of</b> 400 mg/L <b>tannin</b> <b>addition.</b> At bottling, tannin concentrations in all treatments were higher than the respective control, but none exceeded 50 % retention. This suggests that high concentration <b>additions</b> <b>of</b> exogenous <b>tannin</b> increase the condensed tannins in hybrid red wines, but retention rates vary by cultivar. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|R

The materials used in this study were soybean meal, tea waste, gambier, cow rumen fluid, alcohol, CO 2, McDougall solution, 15 % H 2 SO 4, 0, 5 N NaOH, 0, 5 N HCl, 1 % PP indicator and distilled water. The instruments used were analytical scales, test tubes, oven, extruder machine, waterbath, centrifuge, vacuum flaks, CO 2 gas cylinder, 100 ml syringes glass equipped with silicone hoses and clips to be closed and opened, vaccuntainer, erlenmeyergas chromatography, special flute tube and distillation flask, glass beaker, Erlenmeyer, incubator, pipettes, measuring instruments, magnetic stirrer, peristaltic pump to drain the rumen fluid and heater. This study used completely randomized design in 2 x 3 factorials and 3 replicates by a-factor (a 0 = no extruided and a 1 = extruded) and b-factor(b 0 = no tannins, b 1 = tea waste tannins, b 2 = gambier tannin). The parameters observed including total gas and methane production, the data were taseted by usisng analysis of varience and followed by the Duncan test. The results indicate that there is no interaction between the extrusion and the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> to total gas production, while the production of methane gas does not indicate any influence (p < 0. 05).

Pri kemijski sestavi vina se je vpliv dodatka taninov pokazal le pri merjenju vsebnosti skupnih fenolov. Pri meritvah taninov, antocianov in intenzitete barve razlik v primerjavi s kontrolo ni bilo. Pri senzorični analizi vina se je pokazal močan vpliv dodatka taninov. Na intenzivnost vonja je najbolj vplival tanin Structure, na kakovost vonja pa le največji odmerek dodanega tanina Superb, 6 g/hl. Vsi odmerki tanina Superb so izboljšali taninsko strukturo vina. Dodatek tanina Superb je izboljšal skupni vtis kakovosti vina pri najmanjšem in največjem odmerku, Finesse pa le pri srednjem (6 g/hl). Po primerjalni oceni po Buxbaum-u je razvidno, da so najboljše ocene kakovosti dobila vina z dodatkom tanina Superb. In {{the year}} 2010 {{the impact of}} three {{different}} enological tannins on chemical composition and wine quality of Pinot noir was tested. Considering the chemical composition of wine the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> resulted in higher content of total phenols only.

All the doses of the »Superb« tannin improved the tannin structure of wine. Better general impression of wine quality was acquired by either the highest or lowest addition of the »Superb« tannin and by moderate addition of the »Finesse« tannin (6 g/hL).

40|$|Soil {{aggregates}} are organomineral {{associations with}} a fundamental importance for soil structure and function. Litter from vegetation alters aggregate formation and stability, and polyphenols such as tannins found in leaves, roots and wood {{play an important}} role in soil biogeochemical and biological processes. However, the effect of tannins on soil physical properties remains largely unexplored. We hypothesized that tannins influence aggregate stability through their ability to (i) complex proteins in the soil and (ii) perturb the gelling property of root mucilage. Therefore, Mediterranean soil aggregates were incubated with condensed tannins, either as a pure substrate or in combination with a standard protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA) and with a model root mucilage polysaccharide (polygalacturonic acid, PGA) able to form gel-like structures with divalent cations (notably Ca 2 +) widely present in Mediterranean calcareous soils. The changes in aggregate stability were monitored under controlled conditions, immediately after the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins,</b> after 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months of incubation. Tannins added alone did not yield a significant effect on aggregate stability. However, modulatory effects were found when combinations of treatments occurred. Tannins positively modulated the stabilizing effect of the BSA, giving credit to our hypothesis on the stabilizing role of the tannin-protein complex forming macromolecules, thus enforcing soil particle cohesion within aggregates. However, tannins negatively altered the stabilizing effect of PGA, suggesting that the expected perturbation of the PGA gelation occurred, with detrimental consequences for aggregate stability. Over time, tannins maintained the effect of BSA, suggesting a protective effect of tannins, possibly linked to their ability to slow down the degradation of nitrogen compounds through protein binding. Overall, we showed that tannins reacted with other organic compounds resulting in specific effects on physical soil properties, thus demonstrating that tannins in soils play a role beyond their effects on biogeochemical aspects...|$|E

In order to evaluate the effect induced by the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> three enological <b>tannins</b> <b>of</b> different botanical origin (oak wood, grapes, quebracho) and chemical compositions (hydrolysable, proanthocyanidinic and a mixture of proanthocyanidinic and hydrolysable <b>tannins),</b> four vinifications <b>of</b> Sangiovese grapes (three with each commercial tannin, the forth without addition) were performed in small stainless steel tanks in a winery of Chianti region.

40|$|One of {{the major}} host-defense {{functions}} of alveolar macrophages is the phagocytosis and clearance of inhaled particles deposited in the lower airways and alveolar spaces. Recent {{studies have indicated that}} the condensed tannins present in cotton mill dust stimulate the secretion of neutrophil chemotactic factor and arachidonic acid from resident rabbit alveolar macrophages and that these responses may contribute to the acute pulmonary inflammatory reaction associated with byssinosis. To characterize further the effect <b>of</b> <b>tannin</b> on macrophage function, the ability <b>of</b> <b>tannin</b> to modulate alveolar macrophage spreading and phagocytosis in vitro was examined. Tannin caused a dose-dependent inhibition of alveolar macrophage spreading with nearly complete inhibition occurring at concentrations of 12. 5 micrograms/ml. This inhibitory effect <b>of</b> <b>tannin</b> was not reversed with removal <b>of</b> <b>tannin.</b> Furthermore <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannin</b> to previously spread macrophages actively caused the macrophages to round up. Examination of the structure of alveolar macrophages exposed to tannin by scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed blebs {{on the surface of the}} cells and the loss of most of the cellular organelle structure, as compared to control macrophages. Tannin also modulated the ability of the alveolar macrophages to phagocytize unopsonized latex microspheres. The effect <b>of</b> <b>tannin</b> was biphasic. At the lowest concentration examined (3 micrograms/ml), tannin significantly enhanced phagocytosis of the latex microspheres. However, as the concentration was increased, phagocytosis decreased almost exponentially until at 50 micrograms/ml phagocytosis was significantly inhibited compared to control macrophages. These data indicate that tannin present in inhaled cotton mill dust could significantly decrease the ability of resident alveolar macrophages to phagocytize and thereby clear inhaled dust particles. This inhibitory effect would increase the time that particles remain exposed in the lower airway and alveolar spaces and thereby increase the time that potentially toxic compounds in the dust have to exert their biologic effect. This inhibition of macrophage function may therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of byssinosis...|$|R

40|$|Antioxidants are {{compounds}} {{present in}} food at low concentrations {{and able to}} both protect oxidable substrates and countenrbalance the negative effects that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause {{in the human body}} (reduction of the risk to develop cardiovascular pathologies, cancer and degenerative diseases that accelerate the aging processes). In foods, lipid oxidation is a degradation regarding the unsaturated fatty acids that react with oxygen through several mechanisms such as chemical autoxidation, action of lipoxigenases, photoxidation, and others. Autoxidation is the main oxidation process and proceed via initiation, propagation, and termination steps leading to the hydroperoxide formation. Hydroperoxides could degraded into low molecular weigh compounds such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketons, acids and other low reactive compounds that negatively influence quality, nutritional value and shelf life of foods. Antioxidants are known to act at different levels of the lipid oxidation. They may act in several ways: they can decrease the oxygen concentration, intercept the singlet oxygen, slow the initiation step by scavenging the first free radicals, break the reaction chain to prevent the hydrogen subtraction, and decompose primary products of oxidation into non-radical products. This work reports the results of two studies on the phenolic fraction and potential antioxidant activity of virgin olive oils and red wines produced in Apulia region. Oils were extracted from olives produced at Cerignola and Torremaggiore using a two phase continuous system. Results showed a different phenolic composition of the oils and a good linear correlation between phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Wines were produced from Primitivo grapes pickled at the so-called technological maturity in a vineyard located at Manduria (Taranto). Nine different maceration techniques were applied.

S 1 -O- 02 - 1. 15 - 18 de mayo de 2012. Túnez (Túnez). Some studies have recommended {{the use of}} tannins to modulate ruminal biohydrogenation (BH) of dietary fatty acids and enhance the accumulation of some bioactive metabolites. However, before investigating this use, {{it is necessary to}} make sure that tannins will not impair ruminal fermentation and consequently diet utilization. This experiment was conducted in sheep to study the effect of the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> to a total mixed ration supplemented with 2 % DM of sunflower oil on ruminal fermentation. The assay was carried out in vitro using batch cultures of rumen microorganisms and the gas production technique. Four commercial extracts of tannins [2 hydrolysable (HT: chestnut and oak) and 2 condensed (CT: quebracho and grape) tannins] × 2 doses of each one (2 and 5 % DM) were added to the supplemented diet. Four rumen cannulated ewes were used as donors of ruminal inoculum. According to the kinetics of gas production, only some treatments with tannin (grape 5 % and oak 2 %) were able to reduce significantly the rate of gas production, while most of them decreased slightly (1. 84 % on average) the extent of the degradation in the rumen (ED). Tannin addition had limited effects on the values of pH and VFA production after 24 h incubation but, as expected, decreased ammonia concentration. This reduction was stronger with HT and at 5 %. If these tannin extracts were proved to beneficially modulate ruminal BH, their slight negative effect on the ED should not prevent its recommendation in doses up to 5 % DM. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Supplementing the diet of ruminants with tannins {{has been suggested}} as a strategy to modulate ruminal biohydrogenation (BH) of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (FA) and enhance the accumulation of vaccenic acid (VA) due to an inhibition of the last step of BH. The ultimate goal of this strategy {{is to increase the}} content of some bioactive FA (such as CLA or VA) in the ruminant products. This experiment was conducted in sheep to study the effect of the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> to a total mixed ration supplemented with 2 % DM of sunflower oil on ruminal BH.

Four commercial extracts of tannins [2 hydrolysable (HT: chestnut and oak) and 2 condensed (CT: quebracho and grape) tannins] × 2 doses of each one (2 and 5 % DM)) were added to the supplemented diet. After 24 h incubations, none of the four tannin extracts and none of the two doses tested were able to modify the rumen contents of total CLA, VA or stearic acid. However, some increases were detected in the concentration of linolenic, linoleic and oleic acids, which may suggest a general inhibition of the ruminal BH rather than a specific inhibition of the last step. Most significant results were observed with HT and at 5 %. Overall, the results would not allow to recommend this strategy to modulate ruminal BH and improve the nutritional quality of the ruminant products. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Acacia mangium Willd, Persea americana Mill and Psidium guajava as tannin source to signal grass (Brachiaria brizantha) silage. The silages were made from the first cut of signal grass harvested at 50 days. Four treatment silages were TA: grass ensiled without tannin as control, AM: grass ensiled with A. mangium (6 g tannin /kg fresh weight), PA: grass ensiled with P. americana (6 g tannin /kg fresh weight), and PG: grass ensiled with P. guajava (6 g tannin/kg fresh weight). After mixing, the materials were packed into glass bottle silos (225 g capacity), in triplicate, which were ensiled for 30 days. The results showed that dry matter, organic matter and crude protein concentrations in signal grass silage mixed with <b>tannin</b> <b>of</b> A. mangium were higher (P< 0. 01) compared to other silages. Degradations of dry matter, organic matter and crude protein during ensiling were the lowest in silage with A. mangium tannin additive.
