5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. <b>A</b> <b>module</b> {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. <b>A</b> <b>module</b> is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into <b>a</b> <b>module</b> over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E
5|$|Python 2.2 changes integer {{division}} to round towards negative infinity, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -3. The floor division // operator is introduced. So 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0 and -7.5//3 == -3.0. Adding from __future__ import division causes <b>a</b> <b>module</b> to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next).|$|E

PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as <b>a</b> <b>module</b> in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server software combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.|$|E

5|$|Many {{types of}} objects in {{abstract}} algebra can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, they are called Noetherian in her honor. By definition, a Noetherian ring satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a Noetherian group {{is defined as a}} group in which every strictly ascending chain of subgroups is finite. A Noetherian module is <b>a</b> <b>module</b> in which every strictly ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps. A Noetherian space is a topological space in which every strictly ascending chain of open subspaces becomes constant after a finite number of steps; this definition makes the spectrum of a Noetherian ring a Noetherian topological space.|$|E

5|$|Modularity: The {{cerebellar}} {{system is}} functionally divided into {{more or less}} independent modules, which probably number in the hundreds to thousands. All modules have a similar internal structure, but different inputs and outputs. <b>A</b> <b>module</b> (a multizonal microcompartment in the terminology of Apps and Garwicz) consists of a small cluster of neurons in the inferior olivary nucleus, a set of long narrow strips of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex (microzones), and a small cluster of neurons {{in one of the}} deep cerebellar nuclei. Different modules share input from mossy fibers and parallel fibers, but in other respects they appear to function independently—the output of one module does not appear to significantly influence the activity of other modules.|$|E
