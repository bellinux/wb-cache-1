5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, then not every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For {{that which has}} not efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> so, then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid's {{association}} with Cædwalla may have benefited him in other ways: the Life of Wilfrid {{asserts that the}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore, expressed a wish that Wilfrid succeed him in that role, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> true {{it may be a}} reflection of Wilfrid's {{association with}} Cædwalla's southern overlordship.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its initial}} plausibility, the {{identity}} theory faces a strong {{challenge in the}} form of the thesis of multiple realizability, first formulated by Hilary Putnam. It is obvious that not only humans, but many different species of animals can, for example, experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.|$|E

5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E
5|$|The sum {{argument}} {{advanced by}} the JWP in {{the approval of}} the discovery of nihonium was later criticized in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, as it is only valid if no gamma decay or internal conversion takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the 278Nh decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters become a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have wildly different half-lives (the ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of mere hours, but an excited state 180mTa has never been observed to decay). However, although this study found reason to doubt and criticize the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine, the data from RIKEN for nihonium was found to be congruent, and the data from the Dubna team for moscovium and nihonium to probably be so, thus necessitating no criticism of the IUPAC approval of the discovery of element 113.|$|E

25|$|If stung, {{the site}} will appear red and may remain itchy and swollen for many days. The best {{treatment}} of stings is to first wash the area with soap and water, then use an antiseptic, and if swelling remains apply an ice pack. Many people are allergic to wasp venom, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the case, a sting can result in severe anaphylactic shock. Symptoms of this include swelling of airways, including mouth lips and tongue, troubled breathing, dizziness and tightness of chest. If an individual exhibits any of these symptoms after acquiring a sting from R. romandi seek medical attention immediately.|$|E
25|$|While for {{bodies in}} their own {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium states, the notion of temperature requires that all empirical thermometers must agree as to which of two bodies is the hotter or that {{they are at the}} same temperature, this requirement is not safe for bodies that are in steady states though not in thermodynamic equilibrium. It can then well be that different empirical thermometers disagree about which is the hotter, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> so, then {{at least one of the}} bodies does not have a well defined absolute thermodynamic temperature. Nevertheless, any one given body and any one suitable empirical thermometer can still support notions of empirical, non-absolute, hotness and temperature, for a suitable range of processes. This is a matter for study in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.|$|E

25|$|In most {{corporate}} insolvencies, it {{is likely}} {{that a large number of}} people's jobs rely on continued business. Accordingly, UK labour law touches corporate insolvencies in three main ways. First, employment contracts cannot be changed except when there are good economic, technical or organisational reasons under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006. This matters particularly in the case of a sale of a business' assets. Second, special provisions concern the adoption of employees' contracts by an administrator or other insolvency practitioner, but apparently with various limits on the obligations that survive. Third, employees and their pensions have preferential claims above other creditors' rights, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> exhausted may claim money from the National Insurance Fund or the Pension Protection Fund.|$|E
25|$|Credit card {{security}} {{relies on}} the physical security of the plastic card {{as well as the}} privacy of the credit card number. Therefore, whenever a person other than the card owner has access to the card or its number, security is potentially compromised. Once, merchants would often accept credit card numbers without additional verification for mail order purchases. It's now common practice to only ship to confirmed addresses as a security measure to minimise fraudulent purchases. Some merchants will accept a credit card number for in-store purchases, whereupon access to the number allows easy fraud, but many require the card itself to be present, and require a signature. A lost or stolen card can be cancelled, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> done quickly, will greatly limit the fraud that can take place in this way. European banks can require a cardholder's security PIN be entered for in-person purchases with the card.|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, the Ascension {{itself has}} become an embarrassment, a remnant of an outmoded cosmology.
