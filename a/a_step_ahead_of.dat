The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded the episode with an A-, writing that [...] "the third season of Fringe opened tonight {{with one of the}} strongest, boldest episodes in the whole run of the series". Murray especially praised the [...] "well-written, acted and photographed" [...] taxi scenes between Olivia and Henry. The Los Angeles Times Andrew Hanson particularly enjoyed the nine-minute opening, writing that he loved the episode because of three reasons: Olivia [...] "kicked butt" [...] and stayed <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> Walternate, her struggles with identity, and all of the careful details put into the parallel universe.|$|E

500|$|Farrell's next American films, American Outlaws (2001) and Hart's War (2002), {{were not}} commercially successful. His 2002–2003 films, {{including}} Phone Booth, The Recruit and S.W.A.T. (all thrillers, {{with the former}} two his first starring roles), were well received by critics and successful at the box office. Of Phone Booth, Ebert wrote that it is [...] "Farrell's to win or lose, since he's onscreen most of the time, and he shows energy and intensity". Philip French of The Observer praised Farrell's performance. In S.W.A.T., the actor starred in an ensemble cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, Olivier Martinez and Jeremy Renner; Renner became a friend. Alan Morrison of Empire wrote, [...] "Farrell can usually be relied upon to bring a spark to the bonfire. That's also true of [...]" [...] Elvis Mitchell of the New York Times criticised Farrell's accent, writing that he [...] "employ a wobbly American accent that makes him sound like an international criminal <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the authorities". Ebert and the New York Timess A.O. Scott disagreed on the actor's effectiveness in The Recruit; Ebert noted the actor's likability, but Scott felt that Farrell [...] "spends his time in a caffeinated frenzy, trying to maintain his leading-man sang-froid while registering panic, stress and confusion". Phone Booth earned $46.6million, S.W.A.T. $116.9million and The Recruit $52.8million at the box office.|$|E

50|$|Ogilvie and Rudd {{reasoned}} that to take <b>a</b> further <b>step</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the competition, {{the new car}} should be designed as one huge ground effect system, starting just behind the nose and extending {{all the way to}} the back of the car beyond the rear wheels.

In theory this would create a tremendous amount of downforce, so the chassis would have to be built to be more structurally rigid than that of the Lotus 79. The 80 also would not need wings due to the massive downforce. Chapman approved the idea at once.|$|R
