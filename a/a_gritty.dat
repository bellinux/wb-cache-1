5|$|In 1960 Newman {{devised a}} thriller series for ABC called Police Surgeon, {{starring}} Ian Hendry. Although Police Surgeon {{was not a}} success and was cancelled after only a short run, Newman took Hendry as the star, {{and some of the}} ethos of the programme, to create a new series (not a direct sequel as is sometimes claimed) called The Avengers. Debuting in January 1961, The Avengers became an international success, although in later years its premise differed somewhat from Newman's initial set-up, veering into more humorous territory rather than remaining <b>a</b> <b>gritty</b> thriller.|$|E
5|$|Pierce largely {{fell from}} the movie industry's public eye shortly {{after the release of}} Boggy Creek II. In 1987, he {{directed}} Hawken's Breed, a Western film starring Peter Fonda as a drifter who meets and rescues a young Shawnee woman. While shooting that film, Pierce met the woman who became his second wife, Beth Pulley. In 1996, he directed Renfroe's White Christmas, an adaptation of the classic children's book Renfroe's Christmas. Starting in 1997, he began production on his western film Chasing the Wind (1998), <b>a</b> <b>gritty</b> epic about a mountain man. It proved to be Pierce's final directorial effort, although he continued working as a set decorator for several television shows including MacGyver, Remington Steele, The Twilight Zone and Fresno, a Carol Burnett miniseries parodying prime time soap operas. Pierce's work on the latter show earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Art Direction for a Miniseries or a Special.|$|E
5|$|After the 2000 World Cup, Taylor {{wanted to}} focus on her desire {{to become one of}} the best batsmen in the world. In order to achieve this, she decided to become a {{full-time}} cricketer. After university, she had joined Procter & Gamble, and by 2001 she was earning £38,000 as an IT assistant manager at the company. In contrast, her income from cricket totalled £7,000, and in order to afford to quit her IT job, she had to move back in with her parents. England's next series was against the World Cup runners-up, Australia, who toured in June and July 2001. England's batting remained unreliable, and Australia won all five matches between the sides: two Test matches and three ODIs. Taylor was praised as the only highlight of the English batting; her innings of 50 not out was the highest score by her side in any of the ODIs. In the second Test, she significantly improved on her previous best Test score of 18 runs, batting for over four hours in <b>a</b> <b>gritty</b> performance to reach 137 runs. Taylor missed the tour of India in January 2002 after injuring her knee in a training session, but returned the following summer with a string of good performances in the Super Fours—a competition in which the England selectors place the 48 leading players into four teams—trailing only her England team mate Charlotte Edwards as the leading run-scorer. In the four ODIs that season, against New Zealand and India, Taylor failed to make an impact, scoring just 43 runs in total.|$|E

25|$|The Honeymooners {{was one of}} {{the first}} U.S. {{television}} shows to portray working-class married couples in <b>a</b> <b>gritty,</b> non-idyllic manner (the show is set mostly in the Kramdens' kitchen, in a neglected Brooklyn apartment building). The program also is popular internationally, particularly in Canada, Poland, Norway and Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Two {{varieties}} of barley were cultivated: two-rowed and six-rowed. Two-rowed barley was the older, hulled form; six-rowed barley was unhulled {{and easier to}} thresh, and since the kernels remained intact, store for longer periods. Hulled barley was thus the prevalent type during the Iron Age, but gruels made from it must have had <b>a</b> <b>gritty</b> taste due to the barley’s tough outer layers.|$|E
25|$|He had {{two short}} spells in the Australian Test team.

50|$|Most critics {{compare the}} film unfavorably to Preminger's earlier film Laura which used {{much of the}} same talent as this film.

25|$|Seeking {{for bigger}} things in 1999, Mobiline {{acquired}} Filipino-Tongan Pauliasi Taulava to man the Pals' frontline along with Seigle. Mobiline started the All-Filipino with a 7–0 record before losing a crucial game to San Miguel. The Pals {{ended up with}} the best record after the elimination phase but were defeated by <b>a</b> <b>gritty</b> Barangay Ginebra Kings squad despite a twice to beat advantage on Bal David's incredible last second shot.|$|E
25|$|Recently Ibn al-Muqaffa's {{historical}} milieu itself, when composing his masterpiece in Baghdad {{during the}} bloody Abbasid {{overthrow of the}} Umayyad dynasty, has become the subject (and rather confusingly, also the title) of <b>a</b> <b>gritty</b> Shakespearean drama by the multicultural Kuwaiti playwright Sulayman Al-Bassam. Ibn al-Muqqafa's biographical background serves as an illustrative metaphor for today's escalating bloodthirstiness in Iraq— once again a historical vortex for clashing civilisations on a multiplicity of levels, including the obvious tribal, religious and political parallels.|$|E
5000|$|James Hadfield of The Japan Times {{gave the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of five, saying the film [...] "is a shade off" [...] and that [...] "the {{director}} has attempted to fashion a blackly comic caper from a story that would probably have benefitted from <b>a</b> <b>grittier</b> approach." ...|$|R
50|$|Initial casting had Bergman {{playing the}} virtuous fiancée of Jekyll and Turner as 'bad girl' Ivy. However, Bergman, tired of playing saintly {{characters}} and fearing typecasting, pleaded with Victor Fleming {{that she and}} Turner switch roles. After a screen test, Fleming allowed Bergman to play <b>a</b> <b>grittier</b> role for the first time.|$|R
25|$|Wracked by {{emotional}} {{storms and}} believing {{many of his}} physical ailments to be psychosomatic, Williamson underwent psychiatric evaluation in 1933 at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas, in which he began to learn to resolve the conflict between his reason and his emotion.

25|$|Morin {{was known}} as a goal scorer in juniors. He has the ability to shoot from {{anywhere}} and find open space to shoot, often going {{to the front of the}} net and finding space to score. He possesses a quick release that accompanies a solid shot. Morin is considered <b>a</b> <b>gritty</b> player for a goal scorer, he plays hard and has a bit of an edge in his game. He plays a solid all-round game, possesses a high hockey IQ, and competes every shift.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Burke {{departed}} from Capital Cities/ABC in February 1994, with Thomas Murphy taking over as president before ceding control to Robert Iger. September 1993 saw {{the debut of}} NYPD Blue, <b>a</b> <b>gritty</b> police procedural from Steven Bochco (who created Doogie Howser, M.D. and the critically pilloried Cop Rock for ABC earlier in the decade); lasting twelve seasons, the drama became known for its boundary pushing of network television standards (particularly its occasional use of graphic language and rear nudity), which led some affiliates to initially refuse to air the show in its first season.|$|E
25|$|Davidson’s next project, {{published}} in 1970 as East 100th Street—a two-year documentation of a conspicuously poverty-stricken block in East Harlem—is perhaps his most famous. This project was also {{displayed at the}} Museum of Modern Art. Davidson followed this with Subway, a classic portrayal of the New York City Subway system, in the late 1970s. Using color, Davidson documented <b>a</b> <b>gritty</b> and lively urban underworld. Over a decade later, in the early 1990s, Davidson completed a four-year exploration of Central Park, showing it as a beautiful and grand homage to New York City.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the film}} version, the {{character}} of Yente is reduced, and Perchik's song to Hodel [...] "Now I Have Everything" [...] is cut and replaced by a scene in Kiev.

5|$|After {{the science}} fiction-focused Moonraker, the {{producers}} wanted {{a return to}} the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming. For Your Eyes Only followed <b>a</b> <b>grittier,</b> more realistic approach and a narrative theme of revenge and its consequences. Filming locations included Greece, Italy and England, while underwater footage was shot in The Bahamas.|$|R
50|$|This film portrayed <b>a</b> <b>grittier,</b> more {{realistic}} Tarzan {{who could be}} as savage as his opponents but could also speak eloquently and politely to a woman (Sara Shane) who gets involved in the plot (he also makes love {{to her in the}} jungle at one point, without making any reference to Jane). A fair bit of library film of animals was used.|$|R
25|$|On day 3, England's bowlers {{carried on}} {{from where the}} batsmen left off. Graeme Smith was caught off a rising Anderson {{delivery}} {{early in the day}} to get things going, and all the bowlers contributed from there. Neil McKenzie produced <b>a</b> <b>gritty</b> 40 before being bowled round his legs by Monty Panesar. AB de Villiers scored freely before being very well caught by James Anderson off the bowling of Monty Panesar, and Ashwell Prince compiled a determined century to give the South African innings some resemblance of respectability.|$|E
25|$|Zimbabwe, {{under the}} {{captaincy}} of Stuart Carlisle, {{had been put}} in to bat and fine spells from Najaf Shah and Mohammed Khalil had left Zimbabwe A reeling on 54/4. Coventry proceeded to launch an inspired counter-attack, first with Stuart Matsikenyeri, who scored <b>a</b> <b>gritty</b> 55 {{at the top of}} the order, in a partnership of 68, then Blessing Mahwire dug in with Coventry too, Mahwire scoring 41 in a hundred-run stand for the seventh wicket. Coventry finished on 102* off 143 balls. The innings proved to be the match-winning contribution as Pakistan A subsided to 181a/o, well short of Zimbabwe A's 232.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, Laxman helped India {{to victory}} against Sri Lanka {{with a fine}} century. In June 2006, Laxman again rescued India from a {{difficult}} position against the West Indies with <b>a</b> <b>gritty</b> century. In November 2006, he was selected in the test squad for India's tour of South Africa. In the first test in Johannesburg Laxman scored 73 in the second innings to help India claim a historic 123 run win. In the 2007 tour of England Laxman produced three good innings, two of which were half-centuries and a vital 39 that helped India draw the first test at Lords. He passed the 5000 run landmark in {{the first day of}} the final test.|$|E
50|$|Geordie Racer {{was praised}} for {{attempting}} to bring <b>a</b> <b>grittier</b> edge to educational programmes shown in primary schools. The series also featured Geordie actor Kevin Whately as Spuggy's father. Whately, {{who went on to}} star in Inspector Morse, was joined on screen by his real-life wife, Madelaine Newton, who played his on-screen wife. This was not an intentional decision, but merely an accidental coincidence.|$|R
50|$|The record company, Hi Records, did {{not release}} Green's track as a single, but instead passed the song to his labelmate, Syl Johnson. Johnson's {{recording}} of the song, featuring most of the same musicians as on Green's version, but with additional harmonica and <b>a</b> <b>grittier</b> vocal performance, reached #48 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and #7 on the U.S. Billboard R&B chart.|$|R
50|$|Set {{one year}} after the end of A Real American Hero. The series started its run in 2005 and {{concluded}} at 2008. The series is notable for <b>a</b> <b>grittier</b> take on G.I. Joe. It eschews many of the fantastic elements and focuses on a more realistic aesthetic. The G.I. Joe Team is re-formed albeit with a small active roster while the rest are put on a reserve status.|$|R
