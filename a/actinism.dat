5000|$|<b>Actinism</b> (...) is the {{property}} of solar radiation {{that leads to the}} production of photochemical and photobiological effects. <b>Actinism</b> is derived from the Greek ακτίς, ακτῖνος (a ray or beam). The word <b>actinism</b> is found, for example, in the terminology of imaging technology (esp. photography), medicine (concerning sunburn), and chemistry (concerning containers that protect from photo-degradation), and the concept of <b>actinism</b> is applied, for example, in chemical photography and X-ray imaging.|$|E
50|$|In {{chemical}} terms, <b>actinism</b> is {{the property}} of radiation that lets it be absorbed by a molecule and cause a photochemical reaction as a result. Einstein {{was the first to}} correctly theorize that each photon would be able to cause only one molecular reaction. This distinction separates photochemical reactions from exothermic reduction reactions triggered by radiation.|$|E

40|$|A new {{solution}} for plasma treatment of hazardous gases is presented. The main item {{of the concept}} is the concentration of microwave power, used to generate plasma and completed by a linearly extended bifocal device. Cold plasma up to 1 m in length and up to atmospheric pressure has been tested successfully with Argon at a gas flow of 0. 4 m/sup 3 //h and an average power of 2. 8 kW. Initial experiments on pollutants in air gave a pressure limitation of the present set-up to approximately 100 mbar, due to the molecular nature of air components. It {{was found to be}} caused by the insufficient supply of pulsed microwave power limited through the experimental set-up available. Independent of that limitation it could be demonstrated that the <b>actinism</b> of the plasma on the pollutant is very effective. The significant destruction of halide, hazardous gases like trichlorethene and norfluorane could be demonstrated...|$|E
