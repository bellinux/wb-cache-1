In 2002, Ruth became pregnant and gave birth to her third child, Ben (Thomas Lester).|$|E

25|$|In 1904 {{the first}} signs of {{sleeping}} sickness appeared, and for several years the disease raged among the population and the missionaries. Seven of the twenty one missionaries died.

25|$|During {{the war and}} {{for years}} afterwards, {{partisan}} feeling ran high. The property of Confederates might be confiscated, and, in 1866, a constitutional amendment disfranchising all who had given aid <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> the Confederacy was adopted. The addition of the 14th and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution caused a reaction, the Democratic Party secured control in 1870, and in 1871, the Constitutional Amendment of 1866 was abrogated. The first steps toward this change had been taken, however, by the Republicans in 1870. In August 22, 1872, an entirely new constitution was adopted.|$|E
25|$|Darwin {{returned}} from Malvern {{at the end}} of June 1850 to a reawakening of his fears that his illness might be hereditary. His bright nine-year-old daughter Anne who had become a particular favourite <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> him fell sick. She was miserable for weeks on end, then became feverish. Their doctor could do nothing and thought it might be inherited. She had recovered to some extent by March 1851, but then she and her father were both laid low by influenza. Darwin recovered but Annie was still ill, and on 24 March he took her to Malvern, leaving her there for the best treatment he knew of, and returning to Downe where Emma had stayed as she was pregnant. With his first paper on barnacles printed and Hooker safely returned to Britain laden with specimens, things were looking up, but then on 15 April Annie suffered a serious relapse and Darwin had to rush to her side.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{extensive}} restrictions, limitations, and hardships, Decembrists {{believed that}} they could improve their situation through personal initiative. A constant stream of petitions came out of Petrovsky Zavod addressed to General Leparskii and Emperor Nicholas I. Most of the petitions were written by Decembrists’ wives who had nobly cast aside social privileges <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> follow their husbands into exile. These wives joined {{under the leadership of}} Princess Mariia Volkonskaia, and by 1832, through relentless petitions, managed to secure for their men formal cancellation of labor requirements, and several privileges, including the right of husbands to live with their wives in privacy. Decembrists managed to gain transfers and allowances through persuasive petitions as well as through the intervention of family members. This process of petitioning, and the resultant concessions made by the tsar and officials, was and would continue to be a standard practice of political exiles in Siberia. The chain of bureaucratic procedures and orders linking St. Petersburg to Siberian administration was often circumvented or ignored. These breaks in bureaucracy afforded exiles a small capacity for betterment and activism.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, {{she held}} a meeting at Clarence House which brought {{together}} rape victims and rape support groups. Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Theresa May were guests at the occasion. At the occasion, she introduced a plan to help the victims. About 750 wash-bags, packed with luxury toiletries, were distributed to victims at the centres. Her staff at Clarence House created the wash-bags. The Duchess thought of the gesture after she visited a centre in Derbyshire and asked victims what {{they would like to}} help them feel at ease after the trauma and forensic examinations. According to Clarence House, the event was the first meeting of high-profile figures to focus exclusively on rape and sexual abuse subjects. The same year, the Duchess travelled to Northern Ireland and opened The Rowan, a sexual assault and referral centre at Antrim Area Hospital which was the first centre to provide help <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> rape and sexual abuse victims in Northern Ireland. In March 2016, during a tour to the Western Balkans with her husband, the Duchess visited UNICEF programmes in Montenegro and while there, she discussed child sexual abuse and was shown an exclusive preview of a new app designed to protect children from online sexual abuse.|$|E
500|$|In 1805, the King {{began making}} plans for Charlotte's education, and engaged a large staff of {{instructors}} for his only legitimate grandchild, with the Bishop of Exeter to instruct {{her in the}} faith that King George believed one day Charlotte, as queen, would defend. [...] The King hoped that these teachers would [...] "render her an honour <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> her relations, and a blessing to the dominions over which she may hereafter preside". [...] According to Holme, this instruction made little impression on Charlotte, who chose to learn only {{what she wanted to}} learn.

500|$|Scholars {{argue that}} Muhammad {{had already decided}} upon this {{judgment}} before the Qurayza's surrender, and that Sa'ad was putting his allegiance to the Muslim community above that to his tribe. One reason cited by some for such punishment is that Muhammad's previous clemency towards defeated foes was in contradiction to Arab and Jewish laws of the time, and {{was seen as a}} sign of weakness. [...] Others see the punishment as a response to what was perceived as an act of treason by the Qurayza since they betrayed their joint defence pact with Muhammad by giving aid <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> the enemies of the Muslims. Maxime Rodinson interprets the massacre as an astute political move that overrode all feelings of humanity, in order to remove a constant source of threat to Medina, and dishearten his enemies.|$|E

500|$|Adler {{arrived in}} London with few contacts. In Whitechapel, {{the center of}} Jewish London at that time, he {{encountered}} extremes of poverty that he describes as exceeding any {{he had ever seen}} in Russia or would ever see in New York. The quite distinguished Chief Rabbi of the British Empire at that time, Dr. Nathan Marcus Adler, was a relative. Adler's father had him written a letter of introduction in Hebrew, but nothing could have been farther from the rabbi's desires than to assist Yiddish-language theater. Nathan Marcus Adler viewed Yiddish as a [...] "jargon" [...] that existed at the expense of both liturgical Hebrew and the English necessary for upward mobility, and his Orthodox Judaism [...] "could not endure so much as a blessing given on stage, for such a blessing would be given in vain..."; further, he was afraid that the portrayals of Jews on stage would give aid <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> their enemies.|$|E
500|$|On December 2, 2010, Hayes {{apologized for}} the pain and {{suffering}} he had caused the Petit family and added that: [...] "Death for me will be a welcome relief and I hope it will bring some peace <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> those who I have hurt so much." [...] Judge Jon Blue formally imposed six death sentences, one for each of the capital charges; Blue then added a sentence of 106 years for other crimes Hayes committed during the home invasion, including kidnapping, burglary, and assault, before finishing with, [...] "This is a terrible sentence, but is, in truth, a sentence you wrote for yourself in flames. May God have mercy on your soul." [...] The judge also gave Hayes an official execution date of May 27, 2011; Blue said that this date was a formality, because if Hayes appealed his case, his execution could be delayed for decades. His death sentence became a life sentence in August 2015 when the state abolished the death penalty.|$|E
500|$|Coke's {{challenge}} to the ecclesiastical courts and their ex officio oath {{is seen as the}} origin of the right to silence. With his decision that common law courts could issue writs of prohibition against such oaths and his arguments that such oaths were contrary to the common law (as found in his Reports and Institutes), Coke [...] "dealt the crucial blow to the oath ex officio and to the High Commission". The case of John Lilburne later confirmed that not only was such an oath invalid, but that there was a right to silence, drawing from Coke's decisions in reaching that conclusion. In the trial of Sir Roger Casement for treason in 1916, Coke's assertion that treason is defined as [...] "giving aide <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> the King's enemies within the realme or without" [...] was the deciding factor in finding him guilty. His work in Slade's Case led to the rise of modern contract law, and his actions in the Case of Proclamations and the other pleadings which led to his eventual dismissal went some way towards securing judicial independence. The Statute of Monopolies {{is considered one of the}} first steps towards the eventual English Civil War, and also [...] "one of the landmarks in the transition of [...] economy from the feudal to the capitalist".|$|E

500|$|McGovern {{displayed}} the political resiliency {{he had shown}} in the past. In the 1974 U.S. Senate elections, McGovern faced possible political peril due to having neglected the state during his long presidential campaign, and by May 1973, he had already begun campaigning for reelection. An Air Force pilot and Medal of Honor recipient, Leo K. Thorsness, had just been repatriated after six years as {{a prisoner of war}} in North Vietnam; he publicly accused McGovern of having given aid <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> the enemy and of having prolonged his time as a POW. McGovern replied that if there had been no war, {{there would have been no}} POWs, and that everything he had done had been towards the goal of ending the war sooner. Thorsness became the Republican nominee against McGovern, but despite the two men's different roles in it, the war did not become a significant issue. Instead, the campaign was dominated by farm policy differences and economic concerns over the 1973–75 recession. Thorsness charged McGovern with being a [...] "part-time senator" [...] more concerned with national office and with spending over $2million on his re‑election bid, while McGovern labelled Thorsness a carpetbagger due to his having grown up in Minnesota. In a year in which Democrats were advantaged by the aftereffects of the Watergate scandal, McGovern won re-election in November 1974 with 53 percent of the vote.|$|E
