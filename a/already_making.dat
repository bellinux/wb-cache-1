5|$|King Philip, who {{ascended the}} Spanish throne in 1556, {{acknowledged}} {{the new political}} reality and cultivated his sister-in-law. She was a better ally than the chief alternative, Mary, Queen of Scots, {{who had grown up}} in France and was betrothed to the Dauphin of France. When his wife fell ill in 1558, King Philip sent the Count of Feria to consult with Elizabeth. This interview was conducted at Hatfield House, where she had returned to live in October 1555. By October 1558, Elizabeth was <b>already</b> <b>making</b> plans for her government. On 6 November, Mary recognised Elizabeth as her heir. On 17 November 1558, Mary died and Elizabeth succeeded to the throne.|$|E

Carey's version was met with critical acclaim and extended popularity, leading to it being shown more often than usual. Fans from around the United States made multiple requests for the show to be aired on television, {{and by the end of}} April 1992, Carey's episode of MTV Unplugged had aired over three-times as much as an average episode would. The concert's success tempted Sony officials to use it as some form of an album. However, Carey and Afansieff were <b>already</b> <b>making</b> headway on a new album set tentatively for release in 1993. This being so, Sony decided to release it as an EP, selling for a reduced price due to its shorter length.|$|E
5|$|Islamic mathematicians gathered, {{organised}} and clarified {{the mathematics}} they inherited from ancient Egypt, Greece, India, Mesopotamia and Persia, {{and went on}} to make innovations of their own. Islamic mathematics can be divided into algebra, geometry and arithmetic. Algebra was mainly used for recreation: it had few practical applications at that time. Geometry was studied at different levels. Some texts contain practical geometrical rules for surveying and for measuring figures. Theoretical geometry was a necessary prerequisite for understanding astronomy and optics, and it required years of concentrated work. Early in the Abbasid caliphate, soon after Baghdad was founded in the mid-eighth century, some mathematical knowledge was assimilated from the pre-Islamic Persian tradition in astronomy. Astronomers from India were invited to the court of the caliph in the late eighth century; they explained the rudimentary trigonometrical techniques used in Indian astronomy. Ancient Greek works such as Ptolemy's Almagest and Euclid's Elements were translated into Arabic. By {{the second half of the}} ninth century, Islamic mathematicians were <b>already</b> <b>making</b> contributions to the most sophisticated parts of Greek geometry. Islamic mathematics reached its apogee in the Eastern part of the Islamic world between the tenth and twelfth centuries. Most mathematical works were written in Arabic, others in Persian.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not known}} why the first {{coalfield}} promoters chose this place for a coal port instead of the more obvious Dover.

He was a strong supporter of free trade. Hopkinson was much in demand as a speaker because of his unorthodox views and the frank and clear way in which he expressed them.|$|E

Still, Roman glasswares were <b>already</b> <b>making</b> their way from Western Asia (i.e. the Parthian Empire) to the Kushan Empire in Afghanistan and India and as far Han Empire of China.

The Lavi would have also required a great deal of other competing military requirements and sought investments to be abandoned, thus there were elements of the armed forces that did not support the project and those officers who felt that the F-16 possessed similar performance to the Lavi and was readily available <b>already,</b> <b>making</b> the foreign F-16 cheaper and easier to procure.

25|$|A {{major event}} in V. A. Urechia's career {{occurred}} in 1869, when Maiorescu and his like-minded friends established Junimea society in Iaşi. At the time, Urechia was editing the journal Adunarea Naţională, which initially regarded the Junimists with sympathy, {{despite the fact}} that Maiorescu was <b>already</b> <b>making</b> his anti-liberal agenda public. By the early 1870s however, Urechia had become engaged in a major cultural polemic with the Junimists, which reflected the liberal-conservative and Romantic-Neoclassical splits within Romanian society. Although usually adverse to other liberal factions, including the group formed around historian Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and Nicolae Ionescu's Fracţiunea liberă şi independentă, he united with them in condemning Junimea 's views and cultural guidelines. Also during that decade, he openly sided with the radicals around C. A. Rosetti, who would, in 1875, contribute {{to the creation of the}} National Liberal Party.|$|E
