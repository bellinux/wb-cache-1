Purpose {{of the study was}} to compare family structure, including marriage, residence, family size, type, role sharing, <b>authority,</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> patterns between Muslim and Santal communities in rural Bangladesh. For this we assumed that family structure with the elements was significantly different between the two communities in rural Bangladesh. In so doing, 288 active couples (145 for Muslim and 143 for Santal) selected by cluster random sampling were intensively interviewed with a semi-structured questionnaire method. The results of Pearson Chi-Squire Test reveal that there were significant differences in the family structure followed by the two communities in the study area.

We propose system architecture using a network of inexpensive cameras and perform video processing in-network. In general, ubiquitous systems have to perform spatial and temporal calibration in advance to determine timing and coordination relationship between sensor nodes, and other application specific design considerations, such as system architecture, distributed software, control <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> channel. A methodology for transforming welldesigned single-node algorithm to distributed system is also proposed. Applications for ubiquitous cameras can be modelled as the composition of system finite state machine, functional services and middleware. A service oriented software architecture is proposed to dynamically reconfigure services when system state changes. We have developed a distributed gesture recognition system with true in-network processing to analyze video in real time. By exchanging data and control messages between neighboring sensors, each node can maintain broader view of the environment with integrated video processing results. Our prototype system is built on Windows machines, and uses webcams as sensors and local network as communication channel. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Since the ICPD in 1994, the Government of Indonesia has {{struggled}} {{with the challenge of}} providing sexual and reproductive health education to adolescents. Following an attempt at a family-centred approach, a pilot project was carried out in Central and East Java to train peer educators, coordinated by the National Family Planning Coordinating Board (BKKBN). A total of 80 peer educators (male/female teams) carried out small-group information sessions in ten different districts. Over 1, 300 adolescents attended in all. Forty peer counsellors in 20 teams then carried out five outreach sessions each in their communities, attended by nearly 4, 000 adults and adolescents. Educators chosen were older in age, knowledge level, <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> skills than adolescents, but were well accepted as mentors. Adolescents wanted to {{know how to deal with}} sexual relationships and feelings, unwanted pregnancy and STDs. With 42 million Indonesian adolescents needing information, the government cannot produce enough manuals to satisfy demand. New strategies are required to put information in the public domain, e. g. via the media. The approach described in this paper would probably be beyond the staffing and resource capacity of most districts in Indonesia. Nonetheless, it shows that there was great enthusiasm across a variety of communities for efforts to educate young people on protecting their reproductive health. A 200...|$|E
40|$|Emergency {{can arise}} due to {{disaster}} {{caused by a}} technology or natural process. Emergency response needs rapid decisions in short time. In the circumstances of an emergency the normal channels of <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> cannot be relied upon to function routinely. The stress of the situation can lead to poor judgment resulting in severe losses. An emergency plan specifies procedures for handling sudden unexpected situations. The objective {{is to reduce the}} possible consequences of the emergency by (i) Preventing fatalities and injuries, (ii) Reducing damage to buildings, stock, and equipment and (iii) accelerating the resumption of normal operations. The geospatial data for emergency management has its significant importance. Data required for different kind of emergency range from spatial to attribute data. However, for technological disasters, required spatial information range from 1 : 10, 000 to 1 : 2000, depending upon the kind of disaster that occurs. The emergency database can be developed on the basis of an object-oriented database design approach that proceeds from data collection, processing, organization and sharing through centralized data repository i. e. data warehouse. Emergency management is a typically multi-disciplinary endeavour, requiring many types of data with spatial and temporal attributes that should be made available to key players in the right format for decisionmaking. There is an enormous amount of geospatial data of all kinds and formats, but it is often hard to find the right data at the right moment by the people who need the information for rescue work and recovery operations. The inability to access information and the lack of standardization, coordination, and communication are all obstacles that need to be overcome. Considering the importance to address the emergency management, Department of Space envisaged a programme for development of geospatial database a...|$|E

This analysis is crucial for organisations to help them understand the different ways in which crises are perceived by citizens, and the reactions they may cause. The results will help authorities in planning their crisis communication. Design/methodology/approach Facebook comments written by <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> citizens are studied and analysed in an exploratory case study related to the 2011 catastrophe in the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant via content analysis. Findings The analysis of Facebook comments revealed that authorities have to be prepared for communicating with citizens with diverging interests, who have different perceptions on a crisis and that relation is not the same with those different profiles of citizens.
