5|$|All {{versions}} of the Su-25 have a metal cantilever wing, of moderate sweep, high aspect ratio and equipped with high-lift devices. The wing consists of two cantilever sections attached to a central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in fairings <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing ribs and spars. Each wing also features a five-section leading edge slat, a two-section flap and an aileron.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> {{the abdomen}} {{is a pair}} of long cerci (paired {{appendages}} on rearmost segment), and in females, the ovipositor is cylindrical, long and narrow, smooth and shiny. The femora (third segments) of the back pair of legs are greatly enlarged for jumping. The tibiae (fourth segments) of the hind legs are armed with a number of moveable spurs, the arrangement of which is characteristic of each species. The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea earns its {{nickname}} {{the corn}} earworm for its widely known destruction of cornfields. The corn earworm feeds on {{every part of}} corn, including the kernels. Severe feeding <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> kernels allows entry for diseases and mold growth. Larvae begin feeding on the kernels once they have reached third instar. Larvae penetrate 9 to 15cm into the ear, with deeper penetration occurring as the kernels harden. Larvae do not eat the hard kernels, but take bites out of many kernels, lowering {{the quality of the}} corn for processing.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} Dirichlet {{problem for the}} 2 D Laplace {{equation}} in a domain bounded by smooth closed curves and smooth cracks. In the formulation of the problem, we do not require compatibility conditions for Dirichlet's boundary data <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cracks. However, if boundary data satisfies <b>the</b> compatibility conditions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cracks, then this is a particular case of our problem. The cases of both interior and exterior domains are considered. The well-posed formulation {{of the problem is}} given, theorems on existence and uniqueness of a classical solution are proved, and the integral representation for a solution is obtained. It is shown that weak solution of the problem does not typically exist, though the classical solution exists. The asymptotic formulae for singularities of a solution gradient <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cracks are presented...|$|R
5|$|Identification of cephalic scales is most {{conveniently}} {{begun with}} reference to the nostril, which is easily identified on a snake. There are two scales enclosing the nostril which are called the nasals. In colubrids, the nostril lies between the nasals, while in vipers it lies in the centre of a single nasal scale. The outer nasal (near the snout) is called the prenasal while the inner nasal (near the eye) is called the postnasal. Along the top of the snout connecting the nasals {{on both sides of the}} head are scales called internasals. Between the two prenasals is a scale <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the snout called the rostral scale.|$|E
5|$|Several species coined in genera {{other than}} Allosaurus are also now {{thought to be}} synonymous with A. fragilis. Labrosaurus ferox was named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a {{prominent}} gap in the tooth row <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and {{that part of the}} unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is recognized as most likely a specimen of A. fragilis.|$|E
5|$|Several tyrannosaurid skeletons {{from the}} Two Medicine Formation and Judith River Formation of Montana {{probably}} belong to Gorgosaurus, although it remains uncertain whether {{they belong to}} G. libratus or a new species. One specimen from Montana (TCMI 2001.89.1), housed in the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, shows evidence of severe pathologies, including healed leg, rib, and vertebral fractures, osteomyelitis (infection) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the lower jaw resulting in permanent tooth loss, and possibly a brain tumor.|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} a tree growing up to 40 meters tall. Mature {{specimens}} may have trunks 70 centimeters in diameter. It is conical or pyramidal in form. The bark peels and releases a red exudate. The leaves are variable {{in shape and}} size. Most grow in clusters on small branches and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> larger branches. <b>The</b> female cones are about 10 centimeters long and wide. The male pollen-bearing cones are up to 15 centimeters long and grow <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> upper branches.|$|R
5|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare {{is similar}} to the Abyssinian hare (Lepus habessinicus) which has grizzled, silvery gray dorsal pelage and has a narrow,black rim <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the ears. It is also similar to the African savannah hare (Lepus victoriae) which has brown dorsal pelage grizzled with black, and ears having lesser black on tip. Its nuchal patch is brownish-orange to orange, and it has not been observed to occur in the Ethiopian plateau.|$|E
5|$|The Seven Days Battles {{were the}} climax of the Peninsula Campaign, during which McClellan's Army of the Potomac sailed around the Confederate lines, landed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> the Virginia Peninsula, {{southeast}} of Richmond, and struck inland towards the Confederate capital. Confederate commander-in-chief Joseph E. Johnston fended off McClellan's repeated attempts to take the city, slowing Union progress on the peninsula to a crawl. When Johnston was wounded, Lee took command and launched a series of counterattacks, collectively called the Seven Days Battles. These attacks culminated in the action on Malvern Hill.|$|E
5|$|US Highway25 (US25) {{was a part}} of the United States Numbered Highway System in {{the state}} of Michigan that ran from the Ohio state line near Toledo and ended <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> The Thumb in Port Austin. The general routing of this state {{trunkline}} highway took it northeasterly from the state line through Monroe and Detroit to Port Huron. Along this southern half, it followed undivided highways and ran concurrently along two freeways, Interstate75 (I-75) and I-94. Near the foot of the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron, US25 turned north and northwesterly along the Lake Huron shoreline to Port Austin.|$|E
