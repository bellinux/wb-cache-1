5|$|The Pipe rolls are <b>the</b> records <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sheriffs' <b>accounts,</b> usually {{conducted}} at Michaelmas by the Exchequer, or English treasury.

They are not a complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources <b>of</b> income, only <b>the</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all payments made by the exchequer. They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounts</b> rendered. Although <b>the</b> rolls use an accounting system, it is not one that would be familiar to modern accountants; for instance until <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12th century, no record was made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total amount taken in by <b>the</b> sheriff <b>of</b> each shire. In their early form, they record all debts owed to the Crown, whether from feudal dues or from other sources.

If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record <b>the</b> full amount <b>of</b> debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed.
