5|$|Thorium {{exists in}} very small {{quantities}} everywhere on Earth: the average human contains about 100micrograms of thorium <b>and</b> <b>typically</b> consumes three micrograms per day. Most thorium exposure occurs through dust inhalation; some thorium comes {{with food and}} water, but because of its low solubility, this exposure is negligible.|$|E
5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure <b>and</b> <b>typically</b> peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E
5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata {{produces}} a white to cream-colored spore print. The spores are spherical or nearly so, <b>and</b> <b>typically</b> measure 7.5–9.0 by 7.0–8.5µm. They are inamyloid, {{meaning that they}} will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 25–44 by 10–14µm. The sterigmata (slender extensions at the basidial tips that attach to the spores) are 3–4µm long, and clamps are not found on the bases of basidia.|$|E

5|$|Anamorphic or {{imperfect}} fungi {{are those that}} seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle, <b>and</b> <b>typically</b> reproduce {{by the process of}} mitosis in structures called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage—or teleomorph stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The anamorphic state of S.coccinea is Molliardiomyces dudleyi.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, most war {{memorials}} {{were relatively}} conservative in design, aiming to use established styles {{to produce a}} tragic but comforting, noble and enduring commemoration of the war dead. Classical themes were particularly common, taking the prevailing styles of the late 19th century <b>and</b> <b>typically</b> simplifying them to produce cleaner, more abstract memorials. Allegorical and symbolic features, frequently drawing on Christian imagery, were used to communicate themes of self-sacrifice, victory and death. Some memorials adopted a medievalist theme instead, looking backwards to a more secure past, while others used emerging realist and Art Deco architectural styles to communicate the themes of the war.|$|E
5|$|As the {{historic}} capital of Imerina, Antananarivo is centrally {{located in the}} homeland of the Merina people, who comprise about 24 {{percent of the population}} and are the largest Malagasy ethnic group. The city's history as the island's major center for politics, culture and trade has ensured a cosmopolitan mix of ethnic groups from across the island and overseas. Most Antananarivo residents have strong ties to their tanindrazana (ancestral village), where the extended family <b>and</b> <b>typically</b> a family tomb or burial place is located; many older residents leave the city upon retirement to return to their rural area of origin.|$|E

5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS), {{also known}} as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years old <b>and</b> <b>typically</b> last for a person's entire life.|$|E
5|$|Birth {{usually takes}} place in the water <b>and</b> <b>typically</b> {{produces}} a single pup weighing 1.4 to 2.3kg (3 to 5lb). Twins occur in 2% of births; however, usually only one pup survives. At birth, the eyes are open, ten teeth are visible, and the pup has a thick coat of baby fur. Mothers have been observed to lick and fluff a newborn for hours; after grooming, the pup's fur retains so much air, the pup floats like a cork and cannot dive. The fluffy baby fur is replaced by adult fur after about 13 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes, {{commonly}} known as the butter-foot bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. First described from New York in 1898, the fungus is found in eastern Asia, Central America, and eastern North America from Canada to Florida. It is a mycorrhizal species <b>and</b> <b>typically</b> grows in association with oak and beech trees.|$|E

5|$|Brachytherapy {{for breast}} or skin cancer may cause scar tissue to form around the {{treatment}} area. In {{the case of}} breast brachytherapy, fat necrosis may occur {{as a result of}} fatty acids entering the breast tissues. This can cause the breast tissue to become swollen and tender. Fat necrosis is a benign condition <b>and</b> <b>typically</b> occurs 4–12 months after treatment and affects about 2% of patients.|$|E
5|$|Broods {{that fail}} {{tend to do}} so during incubation. One English study showed that only 14.5% of eggs survived to hatching, but once that stage was reached the chances of {{fledging}} successfully were high. European nightjars breed when aged one year, <b>and</b> <b>typically</b> live for four years. The adult annual survival rate is 70%, but that for juveniles is unknown. The maximum known age in the wild is just over 12years.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's polonaises show {{a marked}} advance on {{those of his}} Polish {{predecessors}} in the form (who included his teachers Zywny and Elsner). As with the traditional polonaise, Chopin's works are in triple time <b>and</b> <b>typically</b> display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments and cadences. Unlike most of their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.|$|E

5|$|Designed with a V-shaped top in {{the form}} of an {{overturned}} chaika, the šajkača is narrow <b>and</b> <b>typically</b> black or grey in colour. It is usually made of soft, homemade cloth and is worn without any symbols during peacetime. During times of war, cockades featuring the Serbian double-headed eagle and the motto Only Unity Saves the Serbs are often seen on the cap. The šajkača worn by Serbian soldiers during World War I had a non-reflecting peak and was topped with a royal monogram.|$|E
5|$|Esophageal strictures {{are usually}} benign <b>and</b> <b>typically</b> develop after {{a person has}} had reflux for many years. Other strictures may include esophageal webs (which can also be congenital) and damage to the {{esophagus}} by radiotherapy, corrosive ingestion, or eosinophilic esophagitis. A Schatzki ring is fibrosis at the gastro-esophageal junction. Strictures may also develop in chronic anemia, and Plummer-Vinson syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Every atom is {{composed}} of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made {{of one or more}} protons <b>and</b> <b>typically</b> a similar number of neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.|$|E
