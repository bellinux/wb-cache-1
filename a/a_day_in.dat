5|$|As {{with any}} non-repeating calendar, the Maya {{measured}} time from a fixed start point. The Maya set {{the beginning of}} their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of bak'tuns, equivalent to <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bak'tuns. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 bak'tuns, and other inscriptions seem to have used an exceptional cycle of 13 + 20 bak'tun in the current piktun. Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.|$|E
