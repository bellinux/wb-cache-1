The base l(S) of <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> digraph S is {{the maximum}} number k such that for any {{vertices}} u, v of S, there {{is a pair of}} walks of length k from u to v with different <b>signs.</b> <b>A</b> graph can be regarded as a digraph if we consider its edges as two-sided arcs. <b>A</b> <b>signed</b> cyclic graph fCn is <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> digraph obtained from the cycle Cn by giving signs to all arcs.

For <b>a</b> <b>signed</b> graph Σ on n vertices, its exterior k-th power, where k= 1, [...] ,n- 1, is a graph ^kΣ whose adjacency matrix is given by A(^kΣ) = P^† A(Σ^ k) P, where P is the projector onto the anti-symmetric subspace of the k-fold tensor product space (C^n) ^⊗ k and Σ^ k is the k-fold Cartesian product of Σ with itself.
