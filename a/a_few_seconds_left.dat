25|$|Cleveland {{lost to the}} Giants for {{the second}} time in the sixth game of the season at the Polo Grounds in New York. The Giants again managed to stymie the Browns' passing game, but {{employed}} a different strategy from the one they used in three weeks before. Instead of dropping their defensive ends into coverage to handle Cleveland's receivers, New York allowed single coverage on the receivers and had its ends rush Graham, giving him less time to find his men open. Graham lost 71 yards being tackled while dropping back to pass. A fumble by Graham early in the game was recovered by the Giants, leading to New York's first score, a 22-yard field goal. The Browns scored a field goal midway through the second quarter after going for it on fourth down at midfield and getting help from an interference penalty. Tony Adamle recovered a fumble on the ensuing kickoff, and the Browns drove into New York territory as time ran out in the first half. Groza kicked a field goal, putting the Browns ahead 6–3. After Cleveland kicked off to New York with only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> in the half, returner Jim Ostendarp let the ball roll to his own one-yard line and the Browns recovered the live ball. Graham then ran a quarterback sneak for a touchdown. The Giants dominated in the second half, scoring a touchdown on their second drive and adding another in the fourth quarter to win the game, 17–13. Graham was held to just 118 yards of passing on 10 completions. Cleveland defensive end Len Ford suffered a severe injury to his face during the game and had to be taken to the hospital. He sat out the remainder of the regular season and had to have his mouth wired shut so it could heal.|$|E
500|$|Oklahoma State's passing {{attack was}} more active, with both Zac Robinson and Bobby Reid {{completing}} 8passes (on 17attempts for 149yards for Robinson, 12 and 82 for Reid). However, {{they were still}} only able to connect for one touchdown (Reid to D'Jaun Woods in the fourth quarter) and Robinson missed high on a last-second [...] "Hail Mary" [...] that would have tied the game (the PAT would have put the Cowboys up by one with only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> in the game). The Cowboys were also able to produce 119yards and two touchdowns on the ground.|$|E
2500|$|This game {{marked the}} 12th time the Gamecocks have {{traveled}} to Gainesville {{where they were}} winless on the road (0-11) coming into the game. [...] The last time the two teams met in Gainesville, the Gamecocks nearly earned their first victory against the Gators in the Swamp, but fell short with a field goal attempt blocked by Jarvis Moss with only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> in the game. [...] History was also made in this game with it being the first college football game where a Heisman-winning coach (Steve Spurrier) coached against a Heisman-winning player (Tim Tebow). [...] Both Heisman winners also earned their Heisman trophies at the University of Florida. [...] This was only {{the fourth time in}} college football history that two Heisman winners faced one another. [...] South Carolina is the third team of the season the Gators have played against that was coached by a previous championship-winning head coach (Phillip Fulmer of Tennessee and Les Miles of LSU being the other two).|$|E

50|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{continues}} {{to try to}} ask Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to get back together with him, but she continually refuses. Since she dated Michael when she worked in Scranton before and A. J. when she moved to Nashua, she feels like {{she does not want}} to fall into her pattern of dating co-workers again. Michael and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) then go out on a sales call. After landing the sale, an irritable Michael needs to stop to use the bathroom. While at a gas station, Jim gets a call from Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) mother Helene (Linda Purl), who was taking a feverish CeCe to see the doctor when she accidentally locked the child in the car. Panicked, Jim attempts in vain to tell Michael through the door of the bathroom, then tells another gas station customer to tell Michael what happened and drives off, but the customer leaves after only waiting for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds.</b> Michael is <b>left</b> with no way of contacting the office, as his cell phone and wallet are with Jim and he does not remember the office's number, so he ends up wandering around Scranton and making stops at a pet store and a hot dog stand.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the sequel}} Mission-E, Chinami Ebihara has much better control over her abilities, {{and now works}} for the {{organization}} called OZ; her mission to help save other Type-E users from the Foundation and {{teach them how to}} use their abilities. She is equipped with a suit of armor (dubbed as the [...] "Refray Dress") that utilizes her Type-E as a power source to fight off Foundation members. She and Kotaro are still dating and contact each other frequently through handwritten mail (as she always gets too emotional reading his messages she usually destroys electronic equipment) and gets very emotional when she sees him after a long time apart (where in episode 9 she blew up the helicopter room of OZ when he hugged her). In episode 4 she has seemed to have kept her dense trait, as it took Maori three times to suggest that Kotaro and Chinami would want some [...] "private time" [...] together after being away from each other for so long; where it didn't sink into Chinami until <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> after Maori <b>left.</b> In episode 10, Kotaro proposes to her and she accepts. After she discovers that there was a GPS in the ring, she is actually happy; stating that its like saying [...] "he is always with her".|$|R
6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} those Eskimos who were best paddlers crept ahead of the rest. Grabantak and his son took the lead, whether because of right or because of {{superior}} strength {{it was hard to}} say. Anders, who was a powerful fellow, and an expert canoeman, kept close alongside of them. Not content with this, he attempted to pass them; but they saw his intention, put on what sporting men call a [...] "spurt," [...] and in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> him several yards behind.|$|E
6000|$|At first Gunrig took {{no notice}} of this, {{but when he}} {{perceived}} that the tall stranger continued to keep the same position, he held back a little, intending to reverse the position for a time. But Bladud also held back and frustrated his intention. Exasperated by this, Gunrig put on what we in these times call a [...] "spurt," [...] and went ahead at a pace which, in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> <b>left</b> most of the runners a good way behind. This was received by the spectators with a cheer, in which surprise was fully as prominent as satisfaction, for although {{they knew that the}} chief was celebrated for his speed of foot, few of them had actually seen him run before that day, and it at once became evident that if his endurance was equal to his speed, it would go hard with his competitors.|$|E

50|$|Pump Geyser erupts almost {{constantly}} making splashes 2 to 3 feet high, and thumps {{without an}} apparent interval, {{though there are}} less productive periods. Then, in 1990, Pump became a true geyser, with intervals and durations of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds.</b> <b>A</b> small boil builds up to a heavy doming of the water which triggers bursting eruptions that spray water up to 15 feet high.

50|$|Despite being top-scorer in Iceland, it took quite a {{while for}} Pedersen to score his first league goal for Viking. His first goal however, was not only an {{important}} one, but also a beautiful goal. Opponent Odd was leading 2-1 with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> before full-time. Then Pedersen, which came in as a substitute, got the ball and shot it right into the top corner. The game was drawn 2-2, and each team got a point.
