The composer, lyricists, and theatre would reunite {{for two more}} international successes in their next two productions: Boccaccio (1879), Suppé's best-known and most popular operetta; and another cross-dressing army opera in Donna Juanita (1880). However, after these successes, Suppé's later operettas proved less popular with <b>audiences,</b> <b>and,</b> according to the musicologist Andrew Lamb, were also of lower quality.|$|E

Despite Alien 3 poor critical reception, Dance {{said in a}} 2014 Daily Beast interview that he considered the film superior to Aliens and its potential was hampered by 20th Century Fox. According to the actor, his role as Clemens exposed him to American <b>audiences</b> <b>and</b> led to a prominent role as Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones.|$|E
