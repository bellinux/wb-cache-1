5|$|By 1871, the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln was the {{principal}} landowner and Lord of the Manor of Navenby. A witch bottle was discovered in the foundations of a Navenby farmhouse in 2005, thought to date back to about 1830. Containing pins, human hair <b>and</b> <b>urine,</b> the bottle was believed to protect a household against evil spells.|$|E
5|$|In children, the {{penicillamine}} test may be used. A 500 mg oral dose of penicillamine is administered, <b>and</b> <b>urine</b> {{collected for}} 24 hours. If this {{contains more than}} 1600 μg (25 μmol), it is a reliable indicator of Wilson's disease. This test has not been validated in adults.|$|E
5|$|Polytolypa hystricis {{is known}} {{only from the}} dung of the North American porcupine, Erethizon dorsatum. Porcupine dens {{accumulate}} thick layers of nutrient-rich dung, hair <b>and</b> <b>urine</b> that are degraded by a succession of fungi. These fungi are disseminated by arthropods (such as insects) or by the porcupine themselves.|$|E

5|$|Blood <b>and</b> <b>urine</b> samples {{indicated}} {{that she had}} taken the anti-psychotic drug haloperidol, and several days earlier had used cannabis. There were no marks on her body suggestive of a struggle. The firearms officer who first saw her said her feet and hands were clean, her fingernails manicured and not broken, and her fingertips free of blood, dirt or powder. There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from the bullets on the hands. A scenes-of-crimes officer, DC Hammersley, said there were bloodstains {{on the back of}} her right hand, but that otherwise her hands were clean.|$|E
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces <b>and</b> <b>urine.</b> The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Court's decision in Schmerber, many legal scholars feared the ruling {{would be used to}} limit civil liberties. Other scholars, including Nita A. Farahany, Benjamin Holley, and John G. New, have suggested courts may use the ruling in Schmerber to justify the use of mind reading devices against criminal suspects. Because the Court's ruling in Schmerber prohibited the use of warrantless blood tests in most circumstances, some commentators argue that the decision was responsible for the proliferation of breathalyzers to test for alcohol <b>and</b> <b>urine</b> analyses to test for controlled substances in criminal investigations.|$|E

40|$|We are {{reporting}} a fatal case of cyanide intoxication due to voluntary ingestion treated by hydroxycobalamin as antidote. Twelve hours after ICU admission abnormal pink colored skin <b>and</b> <b>urines</b> were observed. The effluent fluid removed during the continuous veno-venous hemofiltration treatment also exhibited pink colour. Even though pink coloured skin <b>and</b> <b>urines</b> {{is a well-known}} side-effect of the hydroxycobalamin use as an antidote for cyanide, such an abnormal colour of the effluent fluid has not been previously reported. Contrary {{to what has been}} described with the haemodialysis machines whose functioning may be impaired by hydroxycobalamin, the device used to perform continuous renal replacement therapy has worked properly in present case. Therefore, continuous renal replacement therapy should be the first choice method if needed in this setting...|$|R
5000|$|Urine {{spraying}} {{is also a}} territorial marking. [...] Although cats may mark {{with both}} sprayed <b>and</b> non-sprayed <b>urine,</b> the spray is usually more thick and oily than normally deposited <b>urine,</b> <b>and</b> may contain additional secretions from anal sacs that help the sprayer to make a stronger communication. While cats mark their territory both by rubbing of the scent glands <b>and</b> by <b>urine</b> <b>and</b> fecal deposits, spraying, most frequently engaged in by unneutered male cats in competition with others of their same sex and species, {{seems to be the}} loudest feline olfactory statement. Female cats also sometimes spray.|$|R
5|$|Selenium may be {{measured}} in blood, plasma, serum, or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or investigate a suspected case of fatal overdose. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates (selenosugars) in the body prior elimination in the urine. Cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma <b>and</b> <b>urine</b> selenium concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Several {{barriers}} protect organisms from infection, including mechanical, chemical, {{and biological}} barriers. The waxy cuticle of most leaves, the exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs, and skin {{are examples of}} mechanical barriers that are {{the first line of}} defense against infection. However, as organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments, other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs, intestines, and the genitourinary tract. In the lungs, coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract. The flushing action of tears <b>and</b> <b>urine</b> also mechanically expels pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.|$|E
5|$|Some {{germanium}} compounds {{have been}} administered by alternative medical practitioners as non-FDA-allowed injectable solutions. Soluble inorganic forms of germanium used at first, notably the citrate-lactate salt, resulted {{in some cases}} of renal dysfunction, hepatic steatosis, and peripheral neuropathy in individuals using them over a long term. Plasma <b>and</b> <b>urine</b> germanium concentrations in these individuals, several of whom died, were several orders of magnitude greater than endogenous levels. A more recent organic form, beta-carboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide (propagermanium), has not exhibited the same spectrum of toxic effects.|$|E

Sheldon is given a black light and several dozen belt buckles to clean. Sheldon performs the task flawlessly. For his second task, Sheldon is forced to wear a French maid costume that Howard originally bought for his girlfriend Bernadette (Melissa Rauch). Sheldon is seen in the cafeteria at Caltech with everyone staring at him.|$|E
5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, {{it may be necessary to}} perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of carnitine in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood <b>and</b> <b>urine</b> may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. Electromyography (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November 2006, Litvinenko (under {{the name}} of Edwin Carter) was {{admitted}} for further investigation at Barnet General Hospital, London. After being moved from his local hospital in north London to University College Hospital in central London for intensive care, his blood <b>and</b> <b>urine</b> samples {{were sent to the}} UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) for testing. Scientists at AWE tested for radioactive poison using gamma spectroscopy. No gamma rays were detected; however, a small spike was noticed at an energy of 803 kilo-electron volts (keV). The BBC reported that by coincidence another scientist, who had worked on Britain's early atomic bomb programme decades before, happened to overhear a discussion about the small spike and recognised it as the gamma ray signal from polonium-210, which was a critical component of early nuclear bombs. On the evening of 22 November, shortly before his death, his doctors were informed the poison was likely to be polonium-210. Further tests on a larger urine sample using spectroscopy designed to detect alpha radiation confirmed the result the following day.|$|E

40|$|Background: Rapid {{diagnostic}} tests (RDTs) have been commercialized {{in order to}} help physicians in dengue diagnosis. Until recently, only blood samples were used for those tests but it has been shown in several studies that <b>urine</b> <b>and</b> saliva can also be employed for dengue diagnosis. RDTs for the detection of NS 1 antigen and anti-dengue IgG, IgM <b>and</b> IgA in <b>urine</b> <b>and</b> saliva specimens have thus been developed by Standard Diagnostics. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performances these new commercial assays. Methods: Two panels of clinical specimens were used: one for the evaluation of the NS 1 -detection devices and the second for the evaluation of the antibody-detection kits. Each panel consisted of <b>urine</b> <b>and</b> saliva specimens collected sequentially from 86 patients with a confirmed dengue infection. A total of 291 saliva <b>and</b> 440 <b>urine</b> samples were included in the NS 1 -evaluation panel and 530 saliva <b>and</b> 528 <b>urine</b> specimens constituted the antibody-evaluation panel. All samples were tested in parallel by in-house ELISAs and by the commercial RDTs. Results: The RDTs demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 15. 5...|$|R
5|$|Short-term {{exposure}} to zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only {{contact with the}} eyes requires medical attention. Persistent {{exposure to}} zirconium tetrachloride results in increased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and a decrease of blood hemoglobin and red blood cells in dogs. However, {{in a study of}} 20 rats given a standard diet containing ~4% zirconium oxide, there were no adverse effects on growth rate, blood <b>and</b> <b>urine</b> parameters, or mortality. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for zirconium exposure is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 10mg/m3. At levels of 25mg/m3, zirconium is immediately dangerous to life and health. However, zirconium is not considered an industrial health hazard. Furthermore, reports of zirconium-related adverse reactions are rare and, in general, rigorous cause-and-effect relationships have not been established. No evidence has been validated that zirconium is carcinogenic or genotoxic.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} {{is the primary}} host of the Bayou virus (BAYV), the second-most common agent of {{hantavirus}} infections in the United States. About 16% of animals are infected and the virus is most prevalent in old, heavy males. The virus may be transmitted among rice rats through bites inflicted during fights. It is also present in rice rat saliva <b>and</b> <b>urine,</b> and human infections may occur because of contact with these excreta. Two related hantaviruses, Catacama virus and Playa de Oro virus, are known from Oryzomys couesi in Honduras and western Mexico, respectively. An arenavirus normally associated with woodrats (Neotoma) has also been found in Florida marsh rice rats. Antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in the United States, {{have been found in}} marsh rice rats in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Another pathogenic bacterium, Bartonella, is known from Georgia marsh rice rats.|$|E
