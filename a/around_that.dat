5|$|The {{long-lived}} Cyclone Pancho-Helinda {{formed on}} January18 in the Australian region from the monsoon trough {{to the north}} of the Cocos Islands. For several days, the system meandered in several directions before maintaining a southwest trajectory on January21. <b>Around</b> <b>that</b> time, the system had intensified into Tropical Cyclone Pancho, reaching 10minute winds of 205km/h (125mph) before weakening occurred. On January23, the cyclone entered the south-west Indian Ocean, at which time Pancho was renamed Helinda. <b>Around</b> <b>that</b> time, the storm was located between two ridges, causing the motion to become nearly stationary, and by January24 Helinda had re-entered the Australian region. <b>Around</b> <b>that</b> time, the storm began undergoing a large loop to the east of 90°E, during which the winds decreased below tropical storm status. The influence of the monsoon trough turned the storm back to the south on January29, and a day later a building ridge turned the storm back to the west. On January31, Helinda again crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean as an intensifying tropical storm.|$|E

She said he was short with her and seemed to hang up in irritation, something he had never done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.|$|E

5|$|Archie Clement led {{the guerrillas}} after Anderson's death, {{but the group}} {{splintered}} by mid-November. Most Confederate guerrillas lost heart <b>around</b> <b>that</b> time, owing to a cold winter {{and the failure of}} General Price's 1864 Missouri campaign, which ensured that the state would remain under Union control. As the Confederacy collapsed, most of Anderson's men joined Quantrill's forces or traveled to Texas. Jim Anderson moved to Sherman, Texas, with his two sisters.|$|E
5|$|Around 300men from Cheadle Hulme {{served in}} the First World War, and {{it was decided that}} those who died should be commemorated.

Additions for later wars have been made, and due to the busy traffic <b>around</b> <b>that</b> particular place there have been suggestions for moving it to a quieter area.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} began to reorganize, the forward motion had become {{virtually}} stationary but later began {{to increase as}} Arlene turned northeastward, beginning recurvature into the main belt of the Westerlies. Ships {{in the vicinity of}} the depression reported that it had regained gale-force winds on August8, resulting in advisories on Arlene being re-initiated <b>around</b> <b>that</b> time. Later that day, a Navy reconnaissance plane found hurricane-force winds around the center of the storm, resulting in Arlene being upgraded to a minimal hurricane a second time.|$|E

The usurpers had inherited an existing system of coastal defence – the earlier Saxon Shore forts – and may have decided to augment it with the construction of Pevensey Castle and its close contemporary, Portus Adurni (Portchester Castle).|$|E

5|$|In January and February 1984, {{conditions}} were favorable for tropical cyclogenesis {{in the southwest}} Indian Ocean, including warmer than normal sea surface temperatures and an active monsoon trough. On January16, a spiral area of convection persisted off the northeast coast of Madagascar, associated with the intertropical convergence zone. That day, it organized enough to warrant a satellite-based Dvorak rating of T2.5, prompting the Réunion Meteorological Service to name it Domoina. <b>Around</b> <b>that</b> time, Météo-France (MFR) estimated winds of about 65km/h (40mph). Domoina initially tracked to the west-northwest, passing near Tromelin Island on January18. <b>Around</b> <b>that</b> time, the storm had begun moving to the southwest, and MFR estimated that it weakened to tropical depression status. On January19, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began warning on Domoina, designating it Tropical Cyclone 14S. The same day, MFR again upgraded Domoina into a moderate tropical storm. On January21, the storm made landfall just south of Tamatave in southeastern Madagascar.|$|E
