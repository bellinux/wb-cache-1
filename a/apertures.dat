2500|$|For some lenses, {{including}} a few long telephotos, lenses mounted on bellows, and perspective-control and tilt/shift lenses, the mechanical linkage was impractical, and automatic <b>aperture</b> control was not provided. [...] Many such lenses incorporated a feature {{known as a}} [...] "preset" [...] <b>aperture,</b> which allows the lens to be set to working <b>aperture</b> and then quickly switched between working <b>aperture</b> and full <b>aperture</b> without looking at the <b>aperture</b> control. A typical operation might be to establish rough composition, set the working <b>aperture</b> for metering, return to full <b>aperture</b> for a final check of focus and composition, and focusing, and finally, return to working <b>aperture</b> just before exposure. Although slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than automatic operation. Preset <b>aperture</b> controls have taken several forms; the most common has been the use of essentially two lens <b>aperture</b> rings, with one ring setting the <b>aperture</b> and the other serving as a limit stop when switching to working <b>aperture.</b> [...] Examples of lenses {{with this type of}} preset <b>aperture</b> control are the Nikon PC Nikkor 28mm 3.5 and the SMC Pentax Shift 6×7 75mm 4.5.

5|$|Ragusa Ibla, {{the lower}} city, boasts an {{impressive}} array of Baroque architecture, which includes the Church of San Giorgio by Rosario Gagliardi, designed in 1738 (Illustration 12). In the design of this church Gagliardi exploited the difficult terrain of the hillside site. The church towers impressively over a massive marble staircase of some 250 steps, a Baroque feature, especially exploited in Sicily due to the island's topography. The tower seems to explode from the façade, accentuated by the columns and pilasters canted against the curved walls. Above the doorways and window <b>apertures,</b> pediments scroll and curve with a sense of freedom and movement which would have been unthinkable to those earlier architects inspired by Bernini and Borromini.

40|$|Abstract—The {{shielding}} {{ability of}} a shielding cavity with an <b>aperture</b> will be greatly degraded at resonance frequencies, and the resonance modes and frequencies are affected by <b>aperture</b> resonances and aperture-cavity coupling, which are closely related with <b>aperture</b> sizes. The equivalent circuit method and numerical method of Transmission Line Matrix (TLM) are {{used to analyze the}} effects of <b>aperture</b> resonances and aperture-cavity coupling on the electromagnetic resonances of a cavity with an <b>aperture</b> in this paper. Both analytical and numerical results show that the resonance modes of a shielding cavity with an <b>aperture</b> consist of cavity resonance modes and <b>aperture</b> resonance modes, and the resonance frequencies will shift with the change of the <b>aperture</b> sizes because of the <b>aperture</b> resonances and aperture-cavity coupling.

5|$|A form of {{decorated}} classical architecture {{peculiar to}} Sicily {{had begun to}} evolve from the 1530s. Inspired by the ruined Greek architecture and by the Norman cathedrals on the island, this often incorporated Greek architectural motifs such as the Greek key pattern into late Norman architecture with Gothic features such as pointed arches and window <b>apertures.</b> The Sicilian Norman architecture incorporated some Byzantine elements seldom found in Norman architecture elsewhere, and like other Romanesque architecture it went on to incorporate Gothic features. This early ornate architecture {{differs from that of}} mainland Europe in not having evolved from Renaissance architecture; instead, it was developed from Norman styles. Renaissance architecture hardly touched Sicily; in the capital city of Palermo, the only remnant of the High Renaissance is the Fontana Pretoria, a water fountain originally made for Don Pietro di Toleda by Florentine artists Franscesco Cammilliani and Michelangelo Naccerino and brought to Sicily when it was already 20 years old (Illustration 5).|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, {{colourless}} {{transcellular fluid}} that circulates around {{the brain in}} the subarachnoid space, in the ventricular system, and in the central canal of the spinal cord. It also fills some gaps in the subarachnoid space, known as subarachnoid cisterns. The four ventricles, two lateral, a third, and a fourth ventricle, all contain choroid plexus that produces cerebrospinal fluid. The third ventricle lies in the midline and {{is connected to the}} lateral ventricles. A single duct, the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum, connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Three separate openings, the middle and two lateral <b>apertures,</b> drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the fourth ventricle to the cisterna magna one of the major cisterns. From here, cerebrospinal fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space, between the arachnoid mater and pia mater.|$|E

40|$|Non-Newtonian {{fluid flow}} in {{fractured}} media {{is of interest}} to hydrologists, geophysicists, and mining engineers. Since laboratory and field investigations evidence a strong degree of variability in fracture <b>aperture,</b> {{a large body of}} literature is specifically concerned with evaluation of an equivalent <b>aperture</b> (or permeability), adopting different constitutive equations and <b>aperture</b> variability models. The equivalent <b>aperture</b> for non-Newtonian fluid flow is defined as the parallel plate <b>aperture</b> which would permit a given volumetric flux under an assigned pressure gradient, thereby generalizing the concept of hydraulic <b>aperture</b> used for Newtonian flow. In this paper, the Bingham model with yield stress  0 has been adopted to describe the fluid rheology; the <b>aperture</b> is taken to vary as a spatially homogeneous and correlated random field with a lognormal <b>aperture</b> density distribution of assigned mean and variance  2. The equivalent fracture <b>aperture</b> is derived for a specific geometry where the flow is perpendicular to the <b>aperture</b> variation. Under ergodicity, results are obtained by discretizing the fracture into elements of equal <b>aperture</b> and assuming that the resistances due to each <b>aperture</b> element are in parallel. The equivalent fracture <b>aperture</b> is greater than the mean, and their ratio is found to depend on <b>aperture</b> variability, represented by log-aperture variance  2, and on a dimensionless parameter , equal to the wall shear stress in a fracture with <b>aperture</b> equal to divided by the Bingham yield stress. The ratio is weakly dependent on , and tends to increase as  2 increases. When  tends to infinity, all our expressions reduce to those derived in the past for Newtonian flow and lognormal <b>aperture</b> distribution...|$|R
5|$|Flying foxes {{often come}} to the {{attention}} of Australian wildlife care and rescue organisations, such as Wildcare Australia, ONARR, Wildlife Carers Darling Downs, Bat Care, Bat Rescue, Tweed Valley Wildlife Carers, WIRES, and Wildlife Victoria when reported as injured, sick, orphaned, or abandoned. A very high proportion of adult flying fox injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard fruit tree netting, both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising death for the animal if not rescued quickly. More recently wildlife advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of wildlife safe fruit tree netting products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install wildlife unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new products have as their chief characteristic small <b>apertures</b> / holes of 5mm x 5mm or less. Flying foxes are able to climb across the netting without being entangled. It is hoped the uptake of wildlife safe netting products will see a marked decline in flying fox entanglements across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and the burden on wildlife rescue and rehabilitation volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{the case}} did not quickly fade. The play Maria Marten, or The Murder in the Red Barn existed in various {{anonymous}} versions; it was a sensational hit throughout the mid 19th century {{and may have been}} the most performed play of the time. Victorian fairground peep shows were forced to add extra <b>apertures</b> for their viewers when exhibiting their shows of the murder. The plays of the Victorian era tended to portray Corder as a cold-blooded monster and Maria as the innocent whom he preyed upon; her reputation and her children by other fathers were airbrushed out, and Corder was made into an older man. Charles Dickens published an account of the murder in his magazine All the Year Round after initially rejecting it because he felt the story to be too well known and the account of the stepmother's dreams rather far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|Otway {{launched}} the assault {{as soon as}} the first glider overshot the battery, ordering the explosives to be detonated to form two paths through the outer perimeter through which the paratroopers attacked. The defenders were alerted by the explosions, and opened fire, inflicting heavy casualties; only four attackers survived to reach Casemate Four, which they disabled by firing into <b>apertures</b> and throwing grenades into air vents. The other casemates were cleared with fragmentation and white phosphorus grenades, as the crews had neglected to lock the doors leading into the battery. During the bombing raid, the battery's guns had been moved inside the casemates and the steel doors left open for ventilation. During the battle, 22 Germans were killed and a similar number made prisoners of war. The rest of the garrison escaped undetected by hiding in the underground bunkers.|$|E

5|$|The pupal cocoon is spun from silk, {{but like}} the larval case, often has other {{materials}} attached. When pupating, species that build portable cases attach them to some underwater object, seal {{the front and back}} <b>apertures</b> against predators while still allowing water to flow through, and pupate within it. Once fully developed, most pupal caddisflies cut through their cases with a special pair of mandibles, swim up to the water surface, moult using the exuviae as a floating platform, and emerge as fully formed adults. They can often fly immediately after breaking from their pupal cuticle. Emergence is mainly univoltine (once per year) with all the adults of a species emerging at the same time. Development is within a year in warm places, but takes over a year in high latitudes and at high elevation in mountain lakes and streams.|$|E
5|$|There {{is about}} 125-150mL of CSF {{at any one}} time. This CSF circulates within the {{ventricular}} system of the brain. The ventricles {{are a series of}} cavities filled with CSF.

From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes into the subarachnoid space through four openings – the central canal of the spinal cord, the median aperture, and the two lateral <b>apertures.</b> CSF is present within the subarachnoid space, which covers the brain, spinal cord, and stretches below the end of the spinal cord to the sacrum.

30|$|This work {{focuses on}} the effect of {{fracture}} <b>aperture</b> distribution on the dominant sub-network that by itself retains 90 % of the effective permeability of the original fracture network. A number of <b>aperture</b> distributions are tested: log-normal and power-law distributions (from narrow to broad), and one where the <b>aperture</b> is proportional to the fracture length. If the <b>aperture</b> distribution is broad enough (α ≤  2 for power-law <b>aperture</b> distributions and σ ≥  0.4 for log-normal <b>aperture</b> distributions), most of the fractures can be eliminated without significantly reducing the effective permeability. As the exponent α of a power-law <b>aperture</b> distribution increases or the standard deviation σ of a log-normal <b>aperture</b> distribution decreases, fewer and fewer fractures can be removed without significantly reducing the network equivalent permeability.|$|R

5|$|To {{overcome}} these challenges, researchers have employed various solutions. Astronomical interferometry, first conceived by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1868, was the seminal concept that has enabled major improvements in modern telescopy {{and led to}} the creation of the Michelson interferometer in the 1880s, and the first successful measurement of Betelgeuse. Just as human depth perception increases when two eyes instead of one perceive an object, Fizeau proposed the observation of stars through two <b>apertures</b> instead of one to obtain interferences that would furnish information on the star's spatial intensity distribution. The science evolved quickly and multiple-aperture interferometers are now used to capture speckled images, which are synthesized using Fourier analysis to produce a portrait of high resolution. It was this methodology that identified the hotspots on Betelgeuse in the 1990s. Other technological breakthroughs include adaptive optics, space observatories like Hipparcos, Hubble and Spitzer, and the Astronomical Multi-BEam Recombiner (AMBER), which combines the beams of three telescopes simultaneously, allowing researchers to achieve milliarcsecond spatial resolution.|$|E
25|$|Pollen <b>apertures</b> are {{regions of}} the pollen wall that may involve exine {{thinning}} or {{a significant reduction in}} exine thickness. They allow shrinking and swelling of the grain caused by changes in moisture content. Elongated <b>apertures</b> or furrows in the pollen grain are called colpi (singular: colpus) or sulci (singular: sulcus). <b>Apertures</b> that are more circular are called pores. Colpi, sulci and pores are major features in the identification of classes of pollen. Pollen may be referred to as inaperturate (<b>apertures</b> absent) or aperturate (<b>apertures</b> present). The aperture may have a lid (operculum), hence is described as operculate. However the term inaperturate covers a wide range of morphological types, such as functionally inaperturate (cryptoaperturate) and omniaperturate. Inaperaturate pollen grains often have thin walls, which facilitates pollen tube germination at any position. Terms such as uniaperturate and triaperturate refer to the number of <b>apertures</b> present (one and three respectively).|$|E

50|$|In general, the <b>aperture</b> of {{an antenna}} is not {{directly}} related to its physical size. However some types of antennas, for example parabolic dishes and horns, have a physical <b>aperture</b> (opening) which collects the radio waves. In these <b>aperture</b> antennas, the effective <b>aperture</b> Aeff must always be less than the area of the antenna's physical <b>aperture</b> Aphys, as {{can be seen from the}} definition above. An antenna's <b>aperture</b> efficiency, ea is defined as the ratio of these two areas:The <b>aperture</b> efficiency is a dimensionless parameter between 0 and 1.0 that measures how close the antenna comes to using all the radio power entering its physical <b>aperture.</b> If the antenna were perfectly efficient, all the radio power falling within its physical <b>aperture</b> would be converted to electrical power delivered to the load attached to its output terminals, so these two areas would be equal Aeff = Aphys and the <b>aperture</b> efficiency would be 1.0. But all antennas have losses, such as power dissipated as heat in the resistance of its elements, nonuniform illumination by its feed, and radio waves scattered by structural supports and diffraction at the <b>aperture</b> edge, which reduce the power output. <b>Aperture</b> efficiencies of typical antennas vary from 0.35 to 0.70 but can range up to 0.90.|$|R
