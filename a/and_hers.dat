5|$|The Jackson-Rowe {{friendship}} {{would last}} for several years, {{during which time}} Rowe married and divorced Richard Edelman, a man she claimed to have felt trapped by. Rowe and the musician would both {{talk to each other}} about their unhappy marriages; his with Presley <b>and</b> <b>hers</b> with Edelman, a teacher at Hollywood High School. Like Jackson's first wife, Rowe supported the entertainer when he was accused of child sexual abuse. Jackson kept his friendship with Rowe a secret from his wife, who eventually found out but thought nothing of it; she felt the dermatologist's assistant was not her husband's type because she was not glamorous enough.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, 1949, Douglas made a radio {{appearance}} announcing her candidacy. She attacked Downey almost continuously {{throughout the}} remainder of the year, accusing him of being a do-nothing, a tool of big business, and an agent of oil interests. She hired Harold Tipton, a newcomer to California who had managed a successful congressional campaign in the Seattle area, as her campaign manager. Douglas realized that Nixon would most likely be the Republican nominee, and felt that were she to win the primary, the wide gap between Nixon's positions <b>and</b> <b>hers</b> would cause voters to rally to her. Downey, who suffered from a severe ulcer, was initially undecided about running, but announced his candidacy in early December in a speech that included an attack on Douglas. Earl Desmond, a member of the California State Senate from Sacramento whose positions were similar to Downey's, also entered the race.|$|E
5|$|One whole {{month after}} {{the events of the}} {{original}} movie, Mulan and Li Shang preparing to marry but distracted by a task from the Emperor, who wants his three daughters escorted to their own marriage ceremony. Their romantic relationship becomes somewhat strained during the trip, as the romantic couple has differing views on various issues. Meanwhile, Mushu realizes that if Mulan marries Shang, she will not need him anymore as her guardian spirit, and decides to trick the two into breaking up. When bandits attack, Mulan and Shang fight them off, but Mulan is devastated when Shang is seemingly killed trying to save her. To make sure the three princesses are not forced to marry against their will, Mulan takes their place marrying the eldest son of the ruler of the neighboring land. Shang survives the accident and arrives in time to stop the wedding but ultimately Mulan is saved by Mushu who, posing as the mighty Golden Dragon of Unity, frees the three princesses from their vows, and marries Mulan and Li Shang himself causing Mulan to forgive him for his actions. Afterwards, Mulan informs Li Shang of Mushu's existence and he combines the temples of his family <b>and</b> <b>hers,</b> allowing Mushu to keep his position.|$|E

25|$|Émilie du Châtelet {{also made}} a {{translation}} of Newton's Principia into French. Unlike LeSeur and Jacquier's edition, hers was a complete translation of Newton's three books and their prefaces. She also included a Commentary section where she fused the three books into a much clearer and easier to understand summary. She included an analytical section where she applied the new mathematics of calculus to Newton's most controversial theories. Previously, geometry was the standard mathematics used to analyse theories. Du Châtelet's translation is the only complete one to {{have been done in}} French <b>and</b> <b>hers</b> remains the standard French translation to this day.|$|E
25|$|The epithet Lucina is {{particularly}} revealing since it reflects two interrelated {{aspects of the}} function of Juno: cyclical renewal {{of time in the}} waning and waxing of the moon and protection of delivery and birth (as she who brings to light the newborn as vigour, vital force). The ancient called her Covella in her function of helper in the labours of the new moon. The view that she was also a Moon goddess though is no longer accepted by scholars, as such a role belongs to Diana Lucifera: through her association with the moon she governed the feminine physiological functions, menstrual cycle and pregnancy: as a rule all lunar deities are deities of childbirth. These aspects of Juno mark the heavenly and worldly sides of her function. She is thus associated to all beginnings <b>and</b> <b>hers</b> are the kalendae of every month: at Laurentum she was known as Kalendaris Iuno (Juno of the Kalends). At Rome on the Kalends of every month the pontifex minor invoked her, under the epithet Covella, when from the curia Calabra announced the date of the nonae. On the same day the regina sacrorum sacrificed to Juno a white sow or lamb in the Regia. She is closely associated with Janus, the god of passages and beginnings who after her is often named Iunonius.|$|E

500|$|Page's {{performance}} was received well by critics; Lynn Hirschberg of The New York Times Magazine said [...] "a star was born, but {{almost no one}} noticed", describing Hard Candy as Page's initial artistic breakthrough performance, and {{her role in the}} 2007 film Juno as her mainstream popularity breakthrough performance. Claudia Puig from USA Today praised her for [...] "remain consistently convincing" [...] to her role which is both [...] "powerful and chilling ... She manages to be both cruelly callous and likable, <b>and</b> <b>hers</b> {{is one of the most}} complex, disturbing and haunting performances of the year." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{numbers of}} {{performers}} used, mainly dancers, is clearly staggering {{compared to the}} regular comedy or serious play, where the norm was something like 10–15 actors plus a few extras. Although actual numbers are generally vague in these mass scene stage directions, dance scenes {{like that of the}} cyclops, and all the cupids who will join them on the floor minutes later, rely on coordination, choreography, and generous collective effects. Of course the many highly paid dancers would be busy in many roles, returning as townspeople after the scene change of Act 3 with most of the gold paint hastily washed off, and entranced looking upwards to see [...] "Mars and Venus meet in the air in their chariots, his drawn by horses, <b>and</b> <b>hers</b> by doves".|$|E

Brienne {{explains}} {{that she has}} come to recruit the Blackfish and the Tully army for Sansa, but Jaime points out that he is currently besieged in Riverrun and refuses to surrender the castle. Brienne proposes that if she can convince the Blackfish to surrender the castle, then Jaime will allow him and the Tully army safe passage to the North. Jaime agrees to the plan, but gives Brienne until nightfall. She then returns Oathkeeper to Jaime, stating that she has completed her mission. Jaime, however, tells her that she can keep it, as Oathkeeper is hers <b>and</b> <b>hers</b> alone. Brienne then attempts to negotiate with the Blackfish, but he refuses to abandon Riverrun, despite being sympathetic to Sansa's plight.|$|E
500|$|The {{style of}} the Rights of Men mirrors much of Burke's own text. It has no clear structure; like Reflections, the text follows the mental {{associations}} made by the author as she was writing. Wollstonecraft's political treatise is written, like Burke's, {{in the form of}} a letter: his to C. J. F. DePont, a young Frenchman, <b>and</b> <b>hers</b> to Burke himself. Using the same form, metaphors, and style as Burke, she turns his own argument back on him. The Rights of Men is as much about language and argumentation as it is about political theory; in fact, Wollstonecraft claims that these are inseparable. She advocates, as one scholar writes, [...] "simplicity and honesty of expression, and argument employing reason rather than eloquence." [...] At the beginning of the pamphlet, she appeals to Burke: [...] "Quitting now the flowers of rhetoric, let us, Sir, reason together." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Chopra {{made her}} screen {{debut in the}} romantic comedy Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, in a {{supporting}} role with Ranveer Singh and Anushka Sharma. The film describes how three girls who are tricked by a con artist take revenge on him by plotting the same trick for him. Chopra played the Delhi-based [...] "rich and spoiled brat" [...] Dimple Chadda, who is betrayed by the film's central character. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and was moderately successful at the box office. Chopra's performance was highly praised by film critics. Komal Nahta said, [...] "Of the three other girls, Parineeti Chopra is undoubtedly the best. She has the best role, the best lines <b>and</b> <b>hers</b> is the best performance among the three." [...] Priyanka Roy of The Telegraph described Chopra as [...] "natural" [...] and wrote [...] "Among the ladies, debutante Parineeti almost steals the show from Anushka." [...] The film earned her several awards, including the Filmfare Award, the Screen Award, the Producers Guild Film Award and the IIFA Award for Best Debut. Chopra also received nominations in the supporting actress category, including Filmfare, and won the Producers Guild and IIFA Awards in the same category.|$|E

During the tour, Beyoncé {{expressed}} her admiration of Wimberly, adding that she would [...] "love to get in the studio some time". Wimberly later contacted Beyoncé's management, and Polachek and himself were later invited to a studio in Manhattan to work on Beyoncé self-titled fifth studio album. They stayed in the studio for a week and when the duo was asked to submit the tracks to Beyoncé's team, Polachek added one song with complete production and a missing verse she had written while being on tour in the United Kingdom. At that time, she felt that the song [...] "could be a good album track for Chairlift, but it would be incredibly sexy if Beyoncé did it". Polachek further elaborated about the differences between her version of [...] "No Angel" [...] and Beyoncé's rendition, saying, [...] "Her groove was different—my vocals were jumpier, <b>and</b> <b>hers</b> were more like panting. And in my version the synths detuned really quickly for a second; she did the same thing but with her voice. It sounds like the whole song melts." ...|$|E
