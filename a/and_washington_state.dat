5|$|After {{the lodge}} was completed, {{it was decided}} to build a {{restaurant}} and breezeway onto the lodge building. Logs for most of the project were shipped via railroad {{from as far away as}} Oregon <b>and</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>state,</b> unloaded in Stratford, Illinois and dragged to the construction site by teams of horses. The CCC project also completed sixteen one-room log cabins and three four-bedroom cabins. The work crews also built picnic shelters, trail shelters, and foot bridges. Only the logs for the cabins came from another source. They were purchased from a salvage company that had purchased utility poles from a defunct utility company at the price of 30 cents a piece.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after this}} junction, NY22 begins a long curve {{away from the}} state line that has it running due west {{at the end of}} NY40 in North Granville. It heads {{northwest}} a little further until, after passing between Great Meadows <b>and</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>state</b> prisons, it reaches US4 and turns right to join it, resuming its northward course. The overlap with US4, one of the few along Route22 that pairs it with another north–south route, lasts for seven miles (11km) along the base of the Adirondack foothills between the low country and Lake George, before ending in Whitehall, where US4 leaves to assume the east–west course it takes across northern New England.|$|E

5|$|A {{commuter}} rail station in Mukilteo {{had been part}} of the original Sound Transit proposal rejected in 1995 and adopted the following year, as part of a Seattle–Everett line on the existing BNSF corridor. The agency selected the station site in 1999, choosing a platform east of State Route 525 and the Washington State Ferries terminal over one at Mukilteo Lighthouse Park because of concerns arising from existing parking and traffic issues in the area. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in August 2007 for the initial phase of the project, the northern side platform, as part of a multimodal transit hub built in conjunction with a new Mukilteo ferry terminal. The $19.2 million project, including preparations for a second phase to open in 2009, was funded by Sound Transit with a grant from the Federal Transit Administration. Sounder service from Mukilteo Station began on May 31, 2008, with a special weekend round-trip run to a Seattle Mariners game. The project was praised by local politicians for its multi-agency cooperation, especially between Sound Transit <b>and</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>State</b> Ferries.|$|E
