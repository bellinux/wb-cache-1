5|$|At birth, infants {{are unable}} to wait for their wants {{and needs to be}} met and exhibit a {{defining}} lack of impulse control. With age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification. Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> of gratification over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that are closely related to attention deficits and behavior problems.|$|E

40|$|The two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{interference}} channel (IC) with {{arbitrary number}} of antennas at each terminal is considered and the {{degrees of freedom}} (DoF) region is characterized {{in the presence of}} noiseless channel output feedback from each receiver to its respective transmitter <b>and</b> availability of <b>delayed</b> channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT). It is shown that having output feedback <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> CSIT can strictly enlarge the DoF region of the MIMO IC when compared to the case in which only delayed CSIT is present. The proposed coding schemes that achieve the corresponding DoF region with feedback <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> CSIT utilize both resources, i. e., feedback <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> CSIT in a non-trivial manner. It is also shown that the DoF region with local feedback <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> CSIT is equal to the DoF region with global feedback <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> CSIT, i. e., local feedback <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> CSIT is equivalent to global feedback <b>and</b> <b>delayed</b> CSIT {{from the perspective of the}} degrees of freedom region. The converse is proved for a stronger setting in which the channels to the two receivers need not be statistically equivalent.

5|$|At Minqar Qaim, the {{division}} was to hold <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> {{the advance of}} the Panzer Army Africa {{for as long as}} it could while remaining intact. By the middle of the afternoon of 27 June, {{the division}} had been encircled by the 21st Panzer Division. Panzer units approached a number of the 2nd New Zealand Division's positions, including the 20th Battalion's sector on the northern side of the Minqar Qaim escarpment, and were successfully beaten off. The New Zealanders broke out that evening with the 4th Brigade breaching the German lines and the 20th Battalion on the northern flank of the chosen withdrawal route. During the action at Minqar Qaim and the subsequent breakout, the battalion's casualties were light, with thirteen men killed and it reached the El Alamein line by 28 June.|$|E
5|$|Because males emerge {{earlier than}} females, the males compete for mating territories {{surrounding}} the nests {{in which the}} females are located. During a fight, the males risk damaging their wings or appendages by butting and grappling. Another defense technique is to grab another male and carry it high into the air, which {{is thought to be}} a demonstration of strength. As a general rule, the larger the male the more predominant he is in battles. Age influences the success in the defense and security of territory; the younger the wasp the greater the chance of a successful takeover of territory. Some small males even engage in non-territorial mating tactics, <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> their emergence so as to have a fairer chance of survival.|$|E

5|$|Demosthenes {{tailored}} {{his style}} {{to be very}} audience-specific. He took pride in not relying on attractive words but rather simple, effective prose. He was mindful of his arrangement, he used clauses to create patterns that would make seemingly complex sentences easy for the hearer to follow. His tendency to focus on delivery promoted him to use repetition, this would ingrain the importance into the audience's minds; he also relied on speed <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> to create suspense and interest among the audience when presenting to most important aspects of his speech.

5|$|Interest in Banak {{rose with}} the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 {{and fears of}} Soviet {{intervention}} in Norway. Finnmark, located on the Norway–Soviet Union border, became of particular interest for the military. Although specific plans were articulated, no construction was carried out. Norway's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 had a dramatic effect on the military strategy and Banak. Norwegian authorities and NATO regarded Finnmark as a tripwire—it was to be sacrificed <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> attacking forces {{in case of a}} Soviet invasion. The airfield was closed in 1952, but the runway remained, with a short section of an unmaintained wooden runway and otherwise consisting of a grass strip. It was occasionally used by small aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Swifts as {{a family}} have smaller egg {{clutches}} and much longer and more variable incubation and fledging times than passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling tubenoses in these developmental factors. Young birds reach a maximum weight heavier than their parents; they can cope with not being fed {{for long periods of}} time, <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> their feather growth when undernourished. Swifts and seabirds have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful. These adaptations mean that when conditions are good, the survival rate is very high. One large Yellow Sea colony had hatching success of 73.5%, with 63.6% of the chicks fledging. The average productivity was 1.24fledged young per pair per year.|$|E

5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{have either}} pyrotechnic applications or associated properties. Boron and silicon are commonly encountered; they act somewhat like metal fuels. Boron {{is used in}} pyrotechnic initiator compositions (for igniting other hard-to-start compositions), and in delay compositions that burn at a constant rate. Boron carbide {{has been identified as}} a possible replacement for more toxic barium or hexachloroethane mixtures in smoke munitions, signal flares and fireworks. Silicon, like boron, is a component of initiator <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> mixtures. Doped germanium can act as a variable speed thermite fuel. Arsenic trisulfide As2S3 was used in old naval signal lights; in fireworks to make white stars; in yellow smoke screen mixtures; and in initiator compositions. Antimony trisulfide Sb2S3 is found in white-light fireworks and in flash and sound mixtures. Tellurium has been used in delay mixtures and in blasting cap initiator compositions.|$|E
5|$|By 1815 Jennings and the {{territorial}} legislature {{were ready to}} embark on a course for statehood. In December 1815 Jennings's introduced a petition from {{the territorial}} legislature to Congress that requested statehood for Indiana. The 1815 census showed the territory had a population exceeding 63,000, more than the minimum requirement for statehood under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The House began a debate on the measure and passed the Enabling Act on April 11, 1816. The act granted Indiana the right to form a government and elect delegates to a constitutional convention that would create a state constitution. The territorial governor, Thomas Posey, expressed concern that the territory was too under-populated to provide sufficient tax revenue to fund a state government. In a letter to President Madison, he recommended that the president veto the bill <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> statehood for another three years, which would allow him to finish his term as governor. Madison signed the bill, ignoring Posey's plea.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry back at Chonui {{remained}} understrength. Half of {{the force}} had constituted Task Force Smith at Osan. B and C Companies were thus still refitting at Chochiwon, leaving A and D Companies {{to hold the line}} with a handful of replacements to fill the extra positions. The battalion numbered around 500 men in total. The 1st Battalion emplaced on hills overlooking the south road of Chonui, northwest of Chochiwon and prepared to meet <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> the advancing North Korean forces, while the 3rd Battalion emplaced behind it in reserve. Around 0555 on July 10, the Americans began to detect North Korean movement through the morning fog. Fifteen minutes after daybreak, a whistle blew, immediately followed by small arms fire on the American positions. American forces at first fired indiscriminately into the fog until the regimental commander, Richard W. Stephens, stopped them. At 0700 the 1st Battalion then came under heavy mortar fire, and A Company on the leftmost ridge was assailed with fire from higher ground by North Korean forces of the 4th Infantry Division. The American forces began using 4.2-inch mortars on the North Korean positions in order to prevent them from advancing directly on their positions. Around 0800 the fog began to lift, and the Americans spotted four T-34 tanks in the village and subsequently called for another airstrike.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{established}} colonial settlements {{to extend}} their power over the surrounding territory, and to serve as administrative centres. They preferred to locate these towns in areas with dense native populations, or close to easily exploitable mineral wealth. Many Spanish towns were founded close to pre-Columbian centres of population. Trujillo was founded near the native settlement of Guaimura, and Comayagua was founded upon a pre-existing town of the same name. In {{the first half of}} the 16th century, towns were abandoned or moved for a variety of reasons, including native attacks, harsh conditions, and the spread of Old World diseases such as smallpox, measles, typhoid, yellow fever, and malaria. In many cases, towns were moved for purely political reasons owing to infighting between Spanish factions, with those currently in power seeking to undermine the work of those who had come before them. The frequent relocation of colonial towns and the reallocation of encomiendas served to prolong political instability, <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> the progress of the conquest.|$|E
5|$|The {{crowd is}} {{notoriously}} loud during Seahawks games. It has twice held the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar {{at an outdoor}} stadium, first at 136.6 decibels in 2013, followed by a measurement of 137.6 decibels in 2014. Both records were eventually broken by crowds at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. The current record was set by fans at Arrowhead on September 29, 2014, in a Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots, hitting 142.2 decibels. The noise {{has contributed to the}} team's home field advantage with an increase in false start (movement by an offensive player prior to the play) <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> of game (failure of the offense to snap the ball prior to the play clock expiring) penalties against visiting teams.

5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for coping with social and interpersonal frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies <b>and</b> <b>delay</b> rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency.|$|E
