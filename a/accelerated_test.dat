50|$|Although {{initially}} {{developed by}} the military, FMEA methodology is now extensively used {{in a variety of}} industries including semiconductor processing, food service, plastics, software, and healthcare. Toyota has taken this one step further with its Design Review Based on Failure Mode (DRBFM) approach. The method is now supported by the American Society for Quality which provides detailed guides on applying the method. The standard Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA)procedures identify the product failure mechanisms, but may not model them without specialized software. This limits their applicability to provide a meaningful input to critical procedures such as virtual qualification, root cause analysis, <b>accelerated</b> <b>test</b> programs, and to remaining life assessment. To overcome the shortcomings of FMEA and FMECA a Failure Modes, Mechanisms and Effect Analysis (FMMEA) has often been used.|$|E

Five proprietary cements submitted by four different manufacturers and four portland cement blends mixed in the laboratory were tested. In this <b>accelerated</b> <b>test</b> method, changes in cement paste strength after sulfate exposure as compared to the strength after 7 days hydration serve as a measurement of sulfate resistance. 3. 0 <b>ACCELERATED</b> <b>TEST</b> TO MEASURE SULFATE RESISTANCE Currently, ASTM describes two <b>accelerated</b> <b>test</b> methods to evaluate the performance of hydraulic cements in sulfate-rich environments: ASTM C 452 Standard Test Method for Potential Expansion of Portland-Cement Mortars Exposed to Sulfate and ASTM C 1012 Test Method for Length Changes of Hydraulic-Cement Mortars Exposed to a Sulfate Solution. Both ASTM test methods {{have been the subject of}} much criticism. Cohen and Mather identified improvements in sulfate testing as a top priority, stating "the current need for reliably predicting long-term durability performance and service life that are based on short-term accelerated tests is more than ever justified. " (9) Many researchers, including Mehta and Gjorv, 1974; Mehta, 1975; Brown, 1981; Cohen and Mather, 1991; Idorn, et al., 1992; Mehta, 1992; and Tumidajski and Turc, 1995; have expressed concern that existing <b>accelerated</b> <b>test</b> methods do not adequately predict field performance. (10 - 12, 9, 13 - 15) Specific criticisms of these test methods with the corresponding references are listed in Table 1.

40|$|Durability {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{barriers}} to polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) being accepted as a commercially viable product. It is therefore important to understand their degradation phenomena and analyze degradation mechanisms from the component level to the cell and stack level so that novel component materials can be developed and novel designs for cells/stacks can be achieved to mitigate insufficient fuel cell durability. It is generally impractical and costly to operate a fuel cell under its normal conditions for several thousand hours, so <b>accelerated</b> <b>test</b> methods are preferred to facilitate rapid learning about key durability issues. Based on the US Department of Energy (DOE) and US Fuel Cell Council (USFCC) <b>accelerated</b> <b>test</b> protocols, as well as degradation tests performed by researchers and published in the literature, we review degradation test protocols at both component and cell/stack levels (driving cycles), aiming to gather the available information on <b>accelerated</b> <b>test</b> methods and degradation test protocols for PEMFCs, and thereby provide practitioners with a useful toolbox to study durability issues. These protocols help prevent the prolonged test periods and high costs associated with real lifetime tests, assess the performance and durability of PEMFC components, and ensure that the generated data can be compared.

To assess the reliability of a product with multiple failure modes, this paper presents an <b>accelerated</b> <b>testing</b> in which both of the high temperatures and the low temperatures are applied. Firstly, an acceleration model based on the Arrhenius model but accounting for the influence of both the high temperatures and low temperatures is proposed. Accordingly, an <b>accelerated</b> <b>testing</b> plan including both the high temperatures and low temperatures is designed, and a statistical analysis method is developed.

The flight-by-flight stress sequences were applied to notched sheet specimens of Ti- 8 Al- 1 Mo- 1 V and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V titanium alloys.

40|$|The {{development}} of an <b>accelerated</b> <b>test</b> schedule for terrestrial solar cells is described. This schedule, based on anticipated failure modes deduced from a consideration of IC failure mechanisms, involves bias-temperature testing, humidity testing (including both 85 - 85 and pressure cooker stress), and thermal-cycle thermal-shock testing. Results are described for 12 different unencapsulated cell types. Both gradual electrical degradation and sudden catastrophic mechanical change were observed. These effects {{can be used to}} discriminate between cell types and technologies relative to their reliability attributes. Consideration is given to identifying laboratory failure modes which might lead to severe degradation in the field through second quadrant operation. Test results indicate that the ability of most cell types to withstand accelerated stress testing depends more on the manufacturer's design, processing, and worksmanship than on the particular metallization system.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of alkali-activated granulated {{blast furnace slag}} (AAS) cement mortars with reactive aggregate due to alkali–silica reaction (ASR) was investigated. The alkaline activator used was NaOH solution with 4 % Na 2 O (by mass of slag). These results were compared to those of ordinary portland cement (OPC) mortars. The ASTM C 1260 - 94 Standard Test Method based on the NBRI <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Test</b> Method was followed. The nature of the ASR products was also studied by SEM/EDX. The results obtained show that the AAS cement mortars experienced expansion due to the ASR, but expansion occurs at slower rate than with OPC mortars under similar conditions. The cause of the expansion in AAS cement mortars is the formation of sodium and calcium silicate hydrate reaction products with rosette-type morphology. Finally, {{in order to determine}} potential expansion due to ASR, the <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Test</b> Method is not suitable for AAS mortars because the reaction rate is initially slow and a longer period of testing is required.
