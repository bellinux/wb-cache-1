6000|$|... "Seems {{to me that}} Sammy is {{very much}} excited this morning," [...] said he, a way he has because he is so much alone. [...] "When he screams like that, Sammy is usually trying {{to do two things}} at once--make trouble for {{somebody}} and keep somebody else out of trouble; and when you come to think of it, that's rather a funny way of doing. It shows that he isn't all bad, {{and at the same time}} he is a long way from being all good. Now, I should say from the sounds that Sammy has discovered Reddy Fox trying to steal up on someone over where my aspen trees are growing. Reddy is afraid of me, but I suspect that he knows that Peter Rabbit has been hanging around here <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>lately,</b> watching me work, and he thinks perhaps he can watch Peter. I shall have to whisper in one of Peter's long ears and tell him to watch out." ...|$|E
6000|$|I recalled, now, {{looking at}} him there in the {{twilight}} of the woods, how happy they had both seemed that sunny afternoon in the city square, as they flashed away from my door and glanced back at me and smiled together. I {{went into the house}} and said to my wife with a formulation of the case which pleased me, [...] "If there is anything in the world that Tedham likes better than to ride after a good horse, it is to ride after a good horse with that little girl of his." [...] "Yes," [...] said my wife, [...] "but a good horse means a good deal of money; even when a little girl goes with it." [...] "That is so," [...] I assented, [...] "but Tedham has made <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>lately</b> in real estate, they say, and I don't know what better he could do with his money; or, I don't believe he does." [...] We said no more, but we both felt, with the ardor of young parents, that it was a great virtue, a saving virtue, in Tedham to love his little girl so much; I was afterward not always sure that it was. Still, when Tedham appealed to me now in the name of his love for her, he moved my heart, if not my reason, in his favor; those old superstitions persist.|$|E

5000|$|Larry {{tells of}} how his sister grew up into a {{striking}} blonde beauty, who had a career rise - and then fall - with her looks. She won a beauty pageant and got some roles in B-movies and glamour modeling, but also went through multiple failed marriages, got involved in alcohol, and, as she aged, was parlaying {{the last of her}} looks by working as a call girl. Larry describes the years in her waning career were not kind to her, but he was too wrapped up in his own affairs to come to her aid. Part of the problem was refusing to acknowledge she had grown up; [...] "To me, my sister was the 8-year old girl in the barn, still without breasts." [...] Larry now reminds himself of his failure to realize the importance of family by preserving a newspaper article of his sister's suicide; [...] "Call Girl Swan Dives to her Death," [...] and his final letter he received from her two weeks before she died, which said [...] "I've been thinking about it <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>lately...</b> and what I've decided is {{that it would have been}} better for me if that last rung had broken before you could put the hay down". Larry states that the words would have been enough to make him realize how desperate she had become. Unfortunately, he had neglected to tell his sister he'd moved, and the letter was not forwarded in time.|$|E

It was a total case of projection. And this song is just trying to sort it out and just kind of admitting that I'm just kind of lost. So it's kind of a dark song. It was very cathartic though."Vocalist James LaBrie said [...] "Kevin Moore saw this photograph in a fashion magazine of a beautiful model wearing a space-dye vest and he fell in love with her," [...] "He carried that magazine around with him for ages, but he realized that the only way the innocence could be kept, so that he could retain that love for her, was if she stayed on the page. If he'd met her, all that would have been lost."
