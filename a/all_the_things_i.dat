500|$|With all appeal avenues {{exhausted}} and no further motivation to deny his crimes, Bundy agreed to speak frankly with investigators. To Keppel, {{he confessed to}} all eight of the Washington and Oregon homicides {{for which he was}} the prime suspect. He described three additional previously unknown victims in Washington and two in Oregon whom he declined to identify (if indeed he ever knew their identities). He said he left a fifth corpse—Donna Manson's—on Taylor Mountain, but incinerated her head in Kloepfer's fireplace. ("Of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> did to ," [...] he told Keppel, [...] "this is probably the one she is least likely to forgive me for. Poor Liz.") ...|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the themes}} and musical styles of the album were {{inspired}} by Beyoncé's role in Dreamgirls. The plot of the film revolves around The Dreams, a fictional 1960s group of three female singers who attempt success in the mainstream music industry {{with the help of}} their manager, Curtis Taylor. Beyoncé portrays Deena Jones, the lead singer of the group and the wife of Taylor, and is emotionally abused by him. Because of her role, Beyoncé was inspired to produce an album with an overriding theme of feminism and female empowerment. In the bonus track, [...] "Encore for the Fans", Beyoncé says, [...] "Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> wish she would have said in the film." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{songs of}} Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness are {{intended}} to hang together conceptually, with {{the two halves of}} the album representing day and night. Despite this, Corgan has rejected the term concept album to describe it, and it was at the time described as more [...] "loose" [...] and [...] "vague" [...] than the band's previous records. However, Billy Corgan has also said that the album is based on [...] "the human condition of mortal sorrow". Corgan aimed the album's message at people aged 14 to 24 years, hoping [...] "to sum up <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> felt as a youth but was never able to voice articulately." [...] He summed up by stating, [...] "I'm waving goodbye to me in the rear view mirror, tying a knot around my youth and putting it under the bed." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Die Another Day, Madonna {{collaborated with}} fashion {{photographer}} Steven Klein in 2003 for an exhibition installation named X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS. It included photography from {{a photo shoot}} in W magazine, and seven video segments. The installation ran from March to May in New York's Deitch Projects gallery. It traveled the world in an edited form. The same year, Madonna released her ninth studio album, American Life, {{which was based on}} her observations of American society; it received mixed reviews. She commented, [...] " [...] was like a trip down memory lane, looking back at everything I've accomplished and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> once valued {{and all the things that}} were important to me." [...] Larry Flick from The Advocate felt that [...] "American Life is an album that is among her most adventurous and lyrically intelligent" [...] while condemning it as [...] "a lazy, half-arsed effort to sound and take her seriously." [...] The title song peaked at number 37 on the Hot 100. Its original music video was canceled as Madonna thought that the video, featuring violence and war imagery, would be deemed unpatriotic since America was then at war with Iraq. With four million copies sold worldwide, American Life was the lowest-selling album of her career at that point.|$|E

500|$|While {{releasing}} {{her third}} studio album Artpop, Gaga held a private event in New York known as ArtRave, where she performed {{songs from the}} album and showcased art pieces. Later, she took the concept of ArtRave and created ArtRave: The Artpop Ball tour. After abruptly cancelling the North American leg of her previous Born This Way Ball (2012–13) tour due to a major hip injury, the tour began with its first leg in the United States on May 4, 2014, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. ArtRave: The Artpop Ball had the singer visiting cities where she canceled tour dates in order to undergo the surgery, as well as playing new cities. Gaga explained to The Independent: [...] "When I'm onstage with the Artpop Ball, {{the point of the}} show is to take what was the mess of my life and make art of it – to raise the spirit of artistic dreams and creativity and take <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> was feeling in pain about, and rage... I take a much more meditative approach to the performance. I've got wide-open ears. The ArtRave has routines, and there's a performance-art aspect that has been designed." [...] Prior {{to the beginning of the}} tour, Gaga headlined six shows (March 28, 30, 31 and April 2, 4, and 6) at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, New York, and these shows were the final performances at the venue. A seventh show was also added for April 7 and officially closed the venue.|$|E
500|$|The {{interlude}} {{was followed}} by a Cabaret-like performance of [...] "Hanky Panky", which started the Circus act. Next a jazz version of [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] was performed with her two female back-up dancers. Then followed [...] "Die Another Day", with Madonna and her dancers in a Tango-like choreography and backdrops displayed an old man in his deathbed. After that, she was strapped into an electric chair as she started singing [...] "Lament" [...] from the soundtrack of the film Evita and the platform rises with her to the top. Madonna commented later that [...] "Lament" [...] was her [...] "favorite part, [...] I like the idea of being restrained. I'm singing about <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> could have had, but my ego got in the way and I destroyed all my happiness." [...] The Orbital remix/video interlude of [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] was performed as dancers swung on trapezes. An acoustic-style segment started with [...] "Nothing Fails", with the guitar being played by Madonna herself. After that, she sang [...] "Don't Tell Me", recreating the choreography from the song's video with her dancers. The next song played was [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] where symbols of the 72 names of God were displayed on the backdrops. During the performance of the combined [...] "Mother and Father", Catholic images along with Madonna's Mother were displayed on the backdrops. Madonna then performed John Lennon's pro-peace song [...] "Imagine" [...] when photo montages of war-ravaged children, bombed-out villages and artillery were displayed in the backdrops. Asked why she chose to cover this song Madonna simply said: [...] "I wanted to make a statement with the ultimate peace song." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Showdown" [...] has [...] "bubbly" [...] {{beats and}} its lyrics, about [...] "fighting and making up with carnal relations", include the lines [...] "I don’t {{really want to}} be a tease / But would you undo my zipper, please?" [...] Rolling Stone {{classified}} the song a pop-dancehall. The fourth track, [...] "Breathe on Me", was described as the most sensual song of the record. Containing trip hop influences, Spears sings, [...] "Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air/ And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there" [...] and [...] "Just put your lips together and blow." [...] "Early Mornin'" [...] depicts Spears looking for men at a club in New York City. The song has a percolating beat and featured subdued vocals from Spears, who purrs and yawns through the track. The nightclub Show is referenced. [...] "Toxic", which Spears later named as her favorite song from her career, was originally offered to Kylie Minogue. Released as the album's second single, it contains elements of electropop and bhangra music, and features varied instrumentation, such as drums, synthesizers, high-pitched strings and surf guitars. Lyrically, [...] "Toxic" [...] talks about being addicted to a lover. [...] "Outrageous", the fourth and final single from the album, is a hip hop-inspired track that according to MTV features Spears [...] "whisper and moan [...] with a snake charmer melody giving the song an exotic feel." [...] The lyrics talk about materialism and amusement, with the singer referencing in the chorus {{a number of things that}} give her pleasure. In [...] "Touch of My Hand", which Spears felt it was comparable to Janet Jackson's [...] "That's the Way Love Goes" [...] (1993), she sings in a lower register. The instrumentation contains elements of Middle Eastern music and its lyrics refer to masturbation, [...] "I will be bold/ Going to the places where I can be out of control/ Don't want to explain tonight/ <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> try to hide." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, Drummond was {{involved}} in a controversial exhibition at the deconsecrated St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Liverpool. Drummond contributed a guestbook which asked visitors [...] "Is God a Cunt?". It was later reported that the artwork had been stolen and a £1000 reward offered for its return. Drummond himself said that he would answer [...] "no" [...] to his own question: [...] "God is responsible for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> love, the speckles on a brown trout; the sound of Angus Young's guitar, the nape of my girlfriend's neck, the song of the blackcap when he returns in Spring. I never blame God for all the shit, for the baby Rwandan slaughtered in a casual genocide, the ever-present wars, drudgery and misery that fills most of our lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{eleventh}} episode of Season 10 {{and the first}} of 2013, [...] "Shabbat Shalom", Ziva's estranged father Eli is killed in a house attack, along with Director Vance's wife Jackie. Glasberg discussed the ramifications that would be shown in the following episode, [...] "Shiva", saying, [...] "There's a part of Ziva that's wounded, and broken, and Tony is there for her — as a friend, and as a coworker ... We end up back in Tony's apartment, and there's some really lovely, emotional stuff that happens." [...] He added, [...] "You'll really see Tony be there for her and support her and emotionally be strong for her. It's <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> hope that people who enjoy the Tony-Ziva relationship will look for." [...] Throughout the episode, Tony attempts to comfort Ziva, taking her to his apartment as a precaution against the possibility of her being the next target and bringing her long-time Israeli friend Shmeil Pinkhas to stay with them. Near {{the end of the}} episode, he comes to see her off as she prepares to fly to Israel for Eli's funeral and assures her in Hebrew that she is not alone.|$|E
2500|$|Berry's love of North Staffordshire {{was deep}} and permanent; he indulged an incurable {{addiction}} to the place. He [...] "had an inexplicable attraction to the place and...was attached to the area by [...] "an invisible umbilical cord", which could never be cut." [...] He said of his childhood [...] "every house seemed to have an old woman, a drunken man, a gang of kids and a snarling dog." [...] Certainly then he was, [...] "a thinker {{of the working class}} who developed a love of middle class pursuits." [...] He said he had [...] "always worked out of one world, the working class world of which I am part", while declaring, [...] "I am a man of habit and pattern." [...] He [...] "became a cult figure following many television appearances in the Midlands." [...] His attachment to the place was a legend. For example, [...] "when he obtained work as a teacher in Chelsea College of Art he commuted every day and night from Biddulph Moor." [...] And indeed [...] "propping up the bar at his local public house...is where he felt most comfortable." [...] Yet it was during the 1950s that the, [...] "crushing black agoraphobia descended on him, virtually imprisoning him in North Staffordshire {{for the rest of his}} life." [...] But as a man, poet, playwright and artist he came into his own. Peter Cheeseman (Director, for thirty five years, of the Victoria Theatre, Stoke-on-Trent and, latterly, the New Victoria Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme), recalls the many animated conversations they had enjoyed, and [...] "the swift gestures of his good left arm, banging at the elbow of his useless right...and the rich talk that pours out of him." [...] He was [...] "eloquent in every way...a vigorous and expressive poet...a writer of stories, a dramatist...grotesquely hilarious... an inspiring teacher of art, loved and admired by his students." [...] He was [...] "a large, ungainly and glum man, tall and remote, cloth cap sitting permanently over his expressionless face." [...] He seemed to have something of a love-hate relationship with his art, for [...] "he once sent a groaning van-load off to Stoke tip: a great weight lifted off me." [...] He was really [...] "a painter and poet of the cluttered and dying landscape of pits and ironworks...he writes of that world with unexpected imagery and a great roaring sense of humour, sometimes wry, often grotesque." [...] As a painter, he strained [...] "to paint a world he loved passionately for its vigour and its energy and its richness before the bulldozer scraped it away." [...] He felt his paintings to be [...] "the most eloquent utterances, portraits of a world seen from the bottom of my rut." [...] This was indeed [...] "a world filled with images of people and landscape that have been twisted and worn into strange shapes by hard work and poverty. My Parthenon is an allotment hut knocked together out of bits of rubbish. It is the richness of poor things that I am drawn to." [...] As he told Peter Cheeseman, [...] "everything I have ever drawn, every house, every man, every face has its roots in those few streets [...] <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> have written, or hope to write, I am sure will have the same roots." ...|$|E

Then he came back to the fire with the observation: [...] "It's rather hard to be found so wanting when one has tried to play one's part so beautifully." [...] He paused with his eyes on her own and then went on with a vibration in his voice: [...] "I've imperilled my immortal soul, or at least bemuddled my intelligence, by <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> don't care for that I've tried to do, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> detest that I've tried to be, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> never can be that I've tried to look as if I were--all the appearances and imitations, the pretences and hypocrisies in which I've steeped myself to the eyes; {{and at the end of}} it (it serves me right!) my reward is simply to learn that I'm still not half humbug enough!" ...|$|E
