5|$|Other {{problems}} faced by the ZNG included <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> trained officers, inadequate troop training, <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> weapons and especially <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> ammunition. Mobilisation proved particularly successful, however, and troops were plentiful; in Zagreb, approximately 80 percent of those called up in September and October reported for service. The ZNG were short of uniforms; 20 percent of those drafted in Zagreb during this period received uniforms, while the remainder fought in civilian clothes. The ZNG also relied on the civilian infrastructure for food, fuel and medical care.|$|E

They entered service over the period June 1922March 1923, and were numbered in the series 746755.|$|E
5|$|Between May and July 1918, {{military}} stores from White City, Wormwood Scrubs and Baker Street {{were moved}} to the site, with items kept in the completed sheds. <b>A</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> bricks in October meant the widening of the bridge over the railway was delayed, as was {{the construction of the}} railway line into the site.|$|E

5|$|Following World War II, the Australian Commonwealth {{and state}} governments {{launched}} a joint Commonwealth Housing Scheme to address a national shortage of accommodation.

5|$|Following the Dunkirk {{evacuation}} in 1940, Britain faced <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> weapons. In particular, {{there was}} a severe scarcity of anti-tank weapons, many of {{which had to be}} left behind in France. One of the few resources not in short supply was petroleum oil since supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities.|$|E

5|$|The {{breakdown}} of the 65th resulted {{from a number of}} factors: <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> officers and non-commissioned officers, a rotation policy that removed combat-experienced leaders and soldiers, tactical doctrine that led to high casualties, <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> artillery ammunition, communication problems between largely white, English-speaking officers and Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican enlisted men, and declining morale. The report also found bias in the prosecution of the Puerto Ricans, citing instances of Continental soldiers who were not charged after refusing to fight in similar circumstances, before and after Jackson Heights. Though the men who were court martialed were pardoned, a campaign for a formal exoneration was launched.|$|E
5|$|The company {{worked on}} tight profit margins {{immediately}} post-war. A combination of <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> skilled labour, outdated batch production methods and increasing costs in materials and payroll were matched by rising overhead, <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> materials {{and issues of}} absenteeism. The result was that despite a booming order book Redman was struggling to fulfil its commitments to customers, and gross margins on lathes were as low as 2.16%. The company {{was by no means}} unique in facing these difficulties but there was much urging, agonising and recriminating, by Gabriel and A K McKay, the Redman managing director since at least 1936, regarding {{how to deal with the}} issues. Some of this, perhaps inevitably as the war-time command economy reverted, was aimed at the government.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> {{aircraft}} {{played a}} role in transporting the task force to France, which had to be divided into two large groups and a small glider group for the British. On D-Day the first large group would be transported to France by 394 aircraft and eighty gliders. A second group of 325 aircraft and 270 gliders would arrive in the afternoon. The smaller British group consisting of the 2nd Parachute Brigade's glider forces would arrive shortly after the first group in the morning. In total 9,099 troops, 221 vehicles and 213 artillery guns would be delivered to France during Operation Rugby.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> engines {{was a major}} {{obstacle}} to mass production {{and development of the}} IK-3, so tests were conducted with more powerful engines, including the Daimler-Benz DB 601, Rolls-Royce Merlin II and Hispano-Suiza 12Y51. The tests were incomplete {{at the time of the}} Axis invasion, and the only prototype to be fitted with a non-production engine was destroyed by factory personnel along with the incomplete production aircraft. Development of a dual-control two-seat trainer variant of the IK-3 had commenced but pressure on the design team had delayed the completion of the project when the invasion intervened.|$|E
5|$|After the {{announcement}} of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.|$|E
