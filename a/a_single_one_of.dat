5|$|Granule cells receive all {{of their}} input from mossy fibers, but outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, the {{information}} in the granule cell population activity state is the same as {{the information in the}} mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way. Because granule cells are so small and so densely packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving animals, so there is little data to use as a basis for theorizing. The most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of mossy fiber inputs. The idea is that with each granule cell receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a granule cell would not respond if only <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its inputs were active, but would respond if more than one were active. This combinatorial coding scheme would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.|$|E

Lacouture points out that for all his undoubted energy and physical courage there is no evidence in his brief period of command that he possessed the “hunter’s eye” of the great battlefield commander, and that not <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his officers joined him in London, although some joined the Resistance in France.|$|E

She also promised to repeal controversial Hudood laws that curtailed {{the rights of women}} However, during her two incomplete terms in office (1988–90 and 1993–96), Benazir Bhutto did not propose any legislation to improve welfare services for women.

The conspiracy plot is praised as a storyline that distinguishes this series from other adaptations. The Daily Telegraph's Stephen Pile criticised the script for [...] "veering between Hammer horror and larky humour" [...] and for being [...] "cheesy". He also criticised Hyde's gravity-defying hijinks and mistook Michelle Ryan for a model. In the same newspaper, James Walton called {{the first episode}} a combination of [...] "a good yarn with several nicely thoughtful touches". David Cornelius of DVDTalk was full of compliments for the series, summing up its review with the statement [...] "six episodes, 300 minutes, not <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them wasted. 'Jekyll' is this year's finest television event".|$|E
500|$|Hubbard's {{military}} career has attracted comment {{from a number}} of journalists and writers over the years. The claims made by the Church of Scientology were not challenged by some early writers; C.H. Rolph quoted without comment a 1968 Scientology biographical sketch circulated to British Members of Parliament in which Hubbard's war service was summarized, and in 1971 Paulette Cooper described as [...] "true" [...] the claim that Hubbard [...] "was severely injured in the war (and in fact was in a lifeboat for many days, badly injuring his body and his eyes in the hot Pacific sun)." [...] Others were more skeptical. George Malko attempted to verify Hubbard's [...] "revealing, anonymously authored, and totally unsubstantiated biography" [...] in 1970 but reported that [...] "I was unable to confirm <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> [...] critical claims: that he had been crippled and blind, the nature of his 'discoveries,' and the medical records stating he had 'twice been pronounced dead.'"

500|$|Although the {{painting}} was celebrated as a technical accomplishment, some critics were uncertain if it had the correct moral effect. The Library of the Fine Arts was critical of its [...] "pantomimic" [...] quality, which it considered [...] "calculated to excite any but such ideas as we should wish to see produced by Art", while The Examiner complained about the depiction of women being attacked, arguing: [...] "Mr Etty should not treat the fair sex in this harsh and wanton manner. We doubt his right to put <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them {{into the hands of}} a Demon, much less to deliver them over by the dozen to the grasp of the destroyers." [...] The Times said, [...] "We do not profess to understand what class of compositions that is which originates neither in history nor poetry—no doubt Mr. Etty does; but {{as far as we can}} comprehend his picture, which is much more intelligible than his language, it represents a quantity of able-bodied demons, who appear angry at the ladies for having stayed out so long, and who are come to fetch them home accordingly", and criticised Etty for a [...] "slovenly manner" [...] and for [...] "abusing his rich gifts, and [...] upon the wild and unmeaning what might be made subservient to much more worthy purposes". Despite this, the same critic conceded that [...] "The work is one of extraordinary power" [...] and that [...] "The figures are drawn with exquisite skill, the grouping admirably varied, and yet so combined as to present a complete picture, and the colouring vigorous and harmonious in an eminent degree." ...|$|E
