40|$|Commercial wind towers {{have been}} the focus of {{intensive}} research in terms of their design and performance. There are two main forces which drive the flow through these devices, external wind and buoyancy due to temperature difference. This study examines the relationship between these two forces and the indoor ventilation rate achieved. The work uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to isolate and investigate the two forces and draw comparisons. The study found that as expected the external driving wind is the primary driving force providing 76 % more internal ventilation than buoyancy driven flow, which is deemed secondary. Moreover the study found that the effect of buoyancy is insignificant without an external <b>airflow</b> <b>passage</b> other than the wind tower itself. The addition of an external <b>airflow</b> <b>passage</b> such as a window in combination with buoyancy force increased the indoor ventilation by 47 %. Therefore the careful positioning of windows in conjunction with internal heat source has the potential to overcome the lack of external wind driven forces in dense urban environments.

Preliminary results obtained using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package show that there are areas within the <b>airflow</b> <b>passage</b> along the cooling tube system that experience recirculation and choking.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to scientifically {{understand}} the operation of the plunger cooling system and quantify the heat transferred from the parison to the plunger during the glass container production process. The paper highlights the results attained and the problems encountered during this investigation. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the cooling air flowing within the plunger cooling tube system used experimental data obtained from both the laboratory test rig and container manufacturing process on the shop floor. Preliminary results attained demonstrated choking together with recirculation of air in some areas along the <b>airflow</b> <b>passage.</b> This confirmed previous findings that areas of excessive tool temperature and rapid tool wear were caused by the ineffective heat extraction. The ineffective heat extraction can be attributed to the poor circulation of cooling air in the plunger. It was concluded that the cooling tube design should be reassessed to improve the airflow in the plunger cooling tube system...|$|E

40|$|Airflow {{and heat}} {{exchange}} characterizations through large bodies of fragmented rock in mines, {{such as those}} at Creighton and Kidd Creek Mines, reveal them to be still fundamentally only empirical in nature. Analysis of the accepted methods for the design and understanding of geometric properties such as the heat exchange area or the length or shape of <b>airflow</b> <b>passages</b> known to affect heat transfer in, for example, heat exchanger design do {{not appear in the}} ‘design’ equations for those bodies of broken rock. This thesis couples a method of discontinuum porous media modelling (referred to as a packed sphere model, abbreviated PSM) with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code to develop a proxy methodology for analysis of porous media that incorporates variables of airflow, heat transfer, and geometry (including porosity and tortuosity). Material property values for equivalent continuum fluid dynamics models are established and are found to follow formulations for airflow branches used in mine ventilation network analysis. Laboratory experiments of airflow and heat transfer with the PSMs were compared to CFD results for the same models on a 1 : 1 scale, to verify the approach and CFD results. Three separate approaches were investigated for the scaling {{of the results of the}} PSMs for use in large scale (~ 1 km 3) CFD simulations of industrial situations. The result of the work presented in this thesis is a verified methodology for establishing CFD airflow and heat transfer parameters for large bodies of broken and fragmented rock from knowledge of the particle size distribution parameters or the body porosity. The application of the methodology is illustrated with reference to the so-called Natural Heat Exchange Area at Creighton Mine, Sudbury, Ontario.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. A {{model for}} {{predicting}} the hangar airflow on the aircraft {{exterior and interior}} is presented. The objective was to analyze the amount of air flowing over and inside the aircraft {{at the time of}} painting, in order to dry the paint effectively and to avoid possible hazardous effects on the painting crew. A 2 D model was simulated for the exterior airflow. Five different sections of the aircraft were considered in simulating the exterior airflow. The angle at which air flows from the diffuser was varied as 0 °, 22. 5 °, 45 °. Optimize the air distribution in the hangar area for effective drying and minimal contamination by paint particles. It was evident that the distribution of air along the aircraft exterior was more effective at angles of 0 ° and 22. 5 °. At 45 ° the airflow was directed away from the aircraft resulting in the circulation of air inside the hangar area. It was concluded that the diffuser can be remodeled {{in such a way that}} center of the diffuser is at 0 ° and 22. 5 ° towards the corners in order to distribute air evenly into the hangar area for effective drying of the paint. The drying of paint on fuselage depends on the airflow from the outside through strategic openings. A 3 D model of the aircraft was developed with open <b>airflow</b> <b>passages.</b> The analysis was conducted for 7 different scenarios where in the pilot and rear doors were closed randomly. The analysis identified the best scenario for uniform distribution within the aircraft. Two major constraints were to maintain a minimum velocity of 100 fpm throughout the inside of the aircraft and 12000 cfm of air at each exit (dog houses). The study showed that an external airflow distributed at 0 ° and 22. 5 ° provided the best scenario for the airflow inside with all doors open...|$|R
40|$|Heating {{capacity}} of an air-source heat pump (ASHP) system often decreases {{when it is}} operated in winter. This is because of frosting significantly affects the heat transfer efficiency of evaporator, and thus the <b>airflow</b> <b>passage</b> blocked. In order to solve this problem, a novel frost-free ASHP system, integrated with dehumidification and thermal energy storage, has been developed. In this paper, to further investigate the dynamic characteristics of the system working at low temperature, a mathematical model of the novel frost-free ASHP system was constructed. The mathematical model was verified by comparison with experimental data that showed that the measured results were in good accordance with the numerical ones. According to the mathematical model, the research results indicated that, at relatively humidity (RH) of 80 %, the system average COP increased by 56. 2 % when ambient temperature increased from − 10 °C to 0 °C. However, it decreased by 6. 7 % when RH increased from 75 % to 85 % at temperature of 0 °C. In addition, the system average COP at the air velocity of 3. 0 m s− 1 was higher 0. 22 and 0. 16 than that of 2. 5 m s− 1 and 3. 5 m s− 1. Finally, the correlations of the system frost-free working time and the system COP with ambient temperature and relative humidity were obtained, respectively, by multivariate linear regression. These results provided a basis in improving and optimizing the thermal system COP and other main performance parameters...|$|E

50|$|Rhino{{manometry}} {{is a form}} of manometry used in {{evaluation of}} the nasal cavity.Rhinomanometry is a standard diagnostic tool aiming to objectively evaluate the respiratory function of the nose. It measures pressure and flow during normal inspiration and expiration through the nose. Increased pressure during respiration is a result of increased resistance to <b>airflow</b> through nasal <b>passages</b> (nasal blockage), while increased flow, which means the speed of airstream, is related to better patency. Nasal obstruction leads to increased values of nasal resistance. Rhinomanometry may be used to measure only one nostril at a time (anterior rhinomanometry) or both nostrils simultaneously (posterior rhinomanometry).|$|R
40|$|Four {{horses were}} {{presented}} to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital with histories of facial asymmetry, nasal discharge or obstruction of normal nasal <b>passage</b> <b>airflow.</b> Radiographic examination of the maxillary sinuses of 2 cases revealed well circumscribed, unilateral, mineralised masses; the other 2 cases showed less mineralisation. The masses were accessed for further investigation by surgically created frontonasal bone flaps or trephination of the maxillary sinuses. Diagnosis of osteoma was confirmed histopathologically in 3 of the cases and of ossifying fibroma in the 4 th. Two horses were euthanased directly after surgical intervention due to poor prognosis. Osteomas are by nature expansile tumours and follow the complex communication of the sinuses, and therefore are not all amenable to surgical removal. Osseous fibromas are large, solitary, expansile lesions that are rare in all species but reported most frequently in horses. They have an apparent predilection for the rostral mandible of the horse...|$|R
40|$|The {{splitting}} of the airflow {{that passes}} through the openings in the combustor liner is vital to its performance. Traditionally, numerical simulations of the gas turbine combustor have limited the computational domain to only the flow field inside the liner, while the airflow distribution over the liner is estimated based on semi-empirical correlations. In addition, the airflow rates {{are assumed to be}} the same through the identical open passages at each combustor axial cross-section. In the present study, the internal and external flow fields of a practical gas turbine combustor liner are directly coupled, so the air splitting is determined by comprehensive simulations. The predicted results for the air distribution are closely correlated to the dataset estimated from recently improved semi-empirical correlations for passage discharge-coefficients. The simulations also show that the effects of the combustion process on the air splitting can be neglected. Lastly, the results reveal that the <b>airflow</b> through identical <b>passages</b> at the same axial cross-section are not equal, and can vary by up to 125...|$|R
40|$|Located in the sub-Antarctic, Marion Island (46 &#x 00 B 0; 54 &#x 2032; S, 37 &#x 00 B 0; 45 &#x 2032; E) has a {{distinct}} periglacial environment that is sensitive to climate change. Diurnal soil frost {{is the most important}} geomorphic process occurring on the island and this paper aims to understand the synoptic weather circulation pattern associated with summer soil frost occurrence in a sub-Antarctic environment. Preliminary results from automated microclimate measurements in the interior of Marion Island show that summer soil frost is dependent on Antarctic air mass circulation. This occurs exclusively during post-cyclonic <b>airflow</b> after the <b>passage</b> of a cold front connected to a mid-latitudinal cyclone and subsequent ridging in of the South Atlantic Anticyclone behind the cold front, or when a series of low pressure systems passes over the island. The duration and intensity of soil frost cycles are dependent on the duration of post-cyclonic Antarctic air mass circulation. Summer soil frost on Marion Island is driven by a complex interaction between the latitudinal position of the passing cyclone, the latitudinal position of the ridging anticyclone as well as the trajectory of the air mass circulation. The data suggest that predicted trends in synoptic climate change in the sub-Antarctic may lead to non-linear responses in soil frost dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{based on}} the nasal cycle are {{difficult}} because multiple measurements of nasal patency {{need to be made}} over many hours. There is a great need for a simple portable instrument that can be used away from the clinical laboratory for studies on the nasal cycle. Our aim was to investigate the usefulness of a small portable spirometer in studying the nasal cycle. The Mir Spirobank spirometer was fitted with a nasal adapter to measure the volume of air expired from each nasal passage during a slow vital capacity (VC). The spirometer was used to measure the fractions of the slow VC volume of air expired through the right and left nasal passage in turn. Hourly measurements were made over a 5 -hour period in six healthy volunteers. The spirometry measurements of the volume of air expired from each nasal passage were compared with nasal conductance of each nasal <b>passage</b> (<b>airflow</b> at 75 Pa) obtained by posterior rhinomanometry. The spirometer was found easy to use by both the investigator and the patients. Simple regression analysis of the spirometer and rhinomanometer measures of airflow partitioning found a correlation coefficient of r = 0. 827 (p < 0. 0001; n = 36). These results indicate that the partitioning of nasal expired volume measured by spirometry is directly comparable with partitioning of nasal airflow obtained with rhinomanometry. Spirometry has considerable advantages over rhinomanometry for studies on the nasal cycle because of portability and ease of use...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} part of automobile safety is the braking system. Disc brakes {{have been widely used}} in automobiles for sped retardation for over 30 years. During that time, they have developed from a simple disc to a complex disc with channels, vanes, holes and grooves. The stopping capability of disc brakes is affected by the rate at which heat is dissipated by forced convection and the thermal capacity of the rotor. Catastrophic failure of brake rotors can occur during rapid increases or decreases in rotor temperature where regions of high temperature gradients result in high thermal strains. There is little information in the public domain regarding the relative merits of different disc brake rotor geometries, particularly in terms of airflow patterns, heat transfer rates, and internal thermal gradients. The aim of this research project was to investigate how geometrical variations affect the thermal performance of bi-directional disc brake rotors, particularly for high performance applications. Dynamometer testing showed that respectable increases in braking performance are achievable with relatively simple machining modifications. Tuft and smoke visualization techniques provided a preliminary understanding of the <b>airflow</b> in the <b>passages</b> of three distinct bi-directional rotor designs. Particle Image Velocimetry was used for detailed flow measurements which supported the numerical simulations. Computational Fluid Dynamics was used to predict the airflow and heat transfer associated with eight bi-directional brake rotor designs. The results show that 'pillared' passage designs can achieve higher heat transfer rates than traditional straight radial vane designs and that the heat loss from pillared rotors is generally more uniform than from vaned rotors. Subsequent conjugate heat transfer simulations found that temperature gradients inside pillared rotors are typically lower than inside vaned rotors. Thus failure rates due to excessive thermal strain are expected to be lower for pillared rotors. It was shown that rotor selection based solely on heat transfer rates is inappropriate and different passage designs are suited to different applications. The findings of this research will directly benefit local disc brake manufacturers, who do not have resources to conduct thorough studies comparing the thermal characteristics of different brake rotor designs...|$|R
