40|$|As {{public schools}} become more diverse {{in terms of}} student population, the US {{teaching}} force remains relatively stable. For this reason, teacher education programs need to provide <b>and</b> sustain <b>social</b> <b>justice</b> learning to ensure pre-service teachers enter classrooms prepared to teach all students. This article examines how pre-service teachers took up identities as <b>social</b> <b>justice</b> educators <b>and</b> sustained <b>social</b> <b>justice</b> learning during lapses in teacher education curricula. Analysis reveals that teacher educators can incorporate methods into course curriculum to ensure <b>social</b> <b>justice</b> learning is sustained in teacher education. Implications for teacher educators include strategies to provide <b>social</b> <b>justice</b> pedagogy scaffolding <b>and</b> offer plausible suggestions to incorporate <b>and</b> sustain <b>social</b> <b>justice</b> education for pre-service teachers when absent in future teacher education curricula...|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the {{transition}} to the postwar economy was hard for the city, as thousands of jobs were lost at the shipyards with the decline in the defense industry. Eventually the city's social structure began to become more liberal. Replacing shipbuilding as a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to expand. No longer needed for defense, most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses. Following the war, in which many African Americans had served, veterans and their supporters stepped up activism to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>justice,</b> especially in the Jim Crow South. During the 1950s the City of Mobile integrated its police force and Spring Hill College accepted students of all races. Unlike {{in the rest of the}} state, by the early 1960s the city buses and lunch counters voluntarily desegregated.|$|E
5|$|Several nuns {{were given}} a {{platform}} to air their views including activist nuns such as Marjorie Tuite, Margaret Traxler, and six nuns of the order Sisters of Loretto, an order known for its work on pacifism <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>justice.</b> In some cases, signers of the statement grew more radical in their beliefs after being reprimanded by church authority. In the publicity surrounding the dispute with the nuns and the theologians, the statistics showing that most American Catholics disagreed with church teachings about abortion were repeated many times. Traxler appeared in a television spot with a tube of toothpaste, saying that you cannot put the toothpaste back in the tube. The various responses to the 1984 advertisement and its aftermath remained in the news through 1986.|$|E
