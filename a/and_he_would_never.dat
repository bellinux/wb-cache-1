5|$|Many people {{weighed in}} on the {{decision}} on both national and local levels. Auriemma felt guilty that he put Sales through the ordeal and was angry that some columnists chose to fault her and not him.

25|$|Strange Bedfellows (1965), with Lollobrigida, was a {{box office}} disappointment. So too was A Very Special Favor (1965), despite {{having the same}} writer and {{director}} as Pillow Talk. That year he was voted the 11th most popular star in the country, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> beat that rank again.|$|E
500|$|Don Novello as Vincenzo [...] "Vinny" [...] Santorini, an Italian demolitions expert. Kirk Wise and Russ Edmonds, Vinny's supervising animator, noted Novello's unique {{ability to}} improvise dialogue. Edmonds recalled, [...] " [...] {{would look at}} the sheet, and he would read the line that was written once, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> read it again! And we never used a written line, it was improvs, the whole movie." ...|$|E
60|$|More than that, he gloried in {{the look}} of them, in the trained, springy strides, in the lithe, erect forms, in the {{assurance}} in every move.

500|$|He {{returned}} to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League for the 1944season, which had switched its major league affiliation to the Cleveland Indians. [...] He enjoyed a resurgence in his offensive statistics that season, as his batting average rose to [...]301, and he hit 24doubles, eight triples, and 12home runs in 133games played.

[...] On March 26, 1946, he was released by the Cleveland Indians, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> appear in another major league game. [...] In his five-season major league career, Benjamin hit [...]229 with five home runs and 41RBIs in 241games.|$|E
500|$|Ryan White {{was seen}} by some as an [...] "innocent victim" [...] of the AIDS epidemic. Ryan White and his family {{strongly}} rejected the language of [...] "innocent victim" [...] because the phrase was often used to imply that gays with AIDS were [...] "guilty". Ryan's mother told The New York Times, Ryan always said, 'I'm {{just like everyone else}} with AIDS, no matter how I got it.' <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have lived as long as he did without the gay community. The people we knew in New York made sure we knew about the latest treatments way before we would have known in Indiana. I hear mothers today say they're not gonna work with no gay community on anything. Well, if it comes to your son's life, you better start changing your heart and your attitude around.|$|E
500|$|Though {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} Baker had {{died as a}} result of engine failure, unsubstantiated rumors began to circulate that his death was not accidental. Those who knew him were aware of his reluctance to return to civilian life and his feelings over the loss of Scott. He could have returned to America and played professional sport, where he could have earned far more money than from a job in finance, but his upbringing made that impossible for him. A career in business held no appeal; during a weekend vacation with a fellow Princeton graduate, Baker revealed that he felt his life was over, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again experience the thrills of football or hockey. In 1966, author John D. Davies published a biography of Baker, in which he noted that a relative of Baker's could not see a future for him in the post-war world. However, Davies refused to elaborate on what he called the [...] "suicide theory of [...] enigmatic death", as he feared that [...] "some of the old guard would be furious if they thought I was trying to prove it".|$|E

6000|$|... "We won't {{argue the}} point," [...] {{returned}} our hero, briefly. He was disgusted with both Merwell <b>and</b> Haskers, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> wished they might both go away <b>and</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> see them again.|$|R
500|$|Wheatley was {{involved}} in competitive athletics from an early age: In his youth, he ran competitively with the Penn Park track team, where, as an eight-year-old, he stood out for his discipline and promptness. [...] Because of his family trouble, he assumed a family leadership role at a relatively young age. [...] Wheatley {{made it clear to}} his brothers and sisters that when chaos came to their lives, they should to turn to him because he would be there <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> fall. When he was in high school, he would take his younger siblings to basketball games, mapping out emergency plans for shooting outbreaks or brawls. Wheatley's guardianship continued throughout his career at the University of Michigan and while he was a professional athlete. While playing in the NFL, he realized that leaving Mongo—the youngest of his siblings—in Inkster and merely providing financial support was not a solution because Mongo was still exposed to gang shootings. As Mongo's guardian, Wheatley moved Mongo to New Jersey for school. Mongo later earned outstanding freshman athlete honors during the Bergen County, New Jersey outdoor track championships while living with Wheatley, who was playing for the Giants at the time. In 2004, with his graduation from high school imminent, Mongo signed a letter of intent with [...] Utah State as a defensive back.|$|E

2500|$|Nolan now {{decided on}} plan B, {{one that was}} made earlier by Jim Harvey. Eight men were to move forward {{following}} Tafoya's trail to Silver Lake and return with water. [...] Unknown to Nolan he would not see these men until August 9 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> see Tafoya or his horse again. After dark Nolan pressed the men another nine miles (14km) before stopping for the night near a mound called [...] "Nigger Hill." [...] Today it is located in Roosevelt County, New Mexico about a mile west of the Texas border. Nolan could hear men down the trail and thinking they were lost fired shots into the air {{for them to find}} camp. [...] Some straggled into camp. Sergeant Umbles, the former First sergeant, was still out in the dark with two sick men. Captain Nolan then had the bugler, also named Nolan, to take a horse and to find and return the men to camp. Those four men never returned. Nolan would charge them with desertion upon his return.|$|E

6000|$|... "No; he made enemies--chiefly, I believe, by {{a certain}} impetuous candour; and they {{hindered}} his advancement, so that he lived in obscurity. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> stoop to conciliate: he could never forget an injury." ...|$|E
