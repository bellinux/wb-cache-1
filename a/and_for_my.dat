[...] While {{in the service of}} the Connecticut militia Morris saw his first action, fighting battles in both Long Island and White Plains. In his memoirs, Morris wrote of this time, stating that [...] "The soldiers universally manifested a great respect for me, for my care of the sick and my attention to their wants, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> sympathies in their distresses." ...|$|E

And you know, just the way I would sing it versus in the way Toni Braxton would sing it. And I love the way it came out, and I think probably the rest of the band really does not like it, and that’s probably why it didn’t make our fifth record, in 2005 when we were recording it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Within {{a week of}} his wedding, Wedge {{had been}} {{committed}} to the psychiatric ward in the Highland Hospital in Oakland, California for observation after admitting to an alienist {{that he had been}} obsessed with either strangling his new wife or defenestrating her during their honeymoon. Wedge also confessed that [...] "for several months I have been fighting a desire to kill myself. For weeks I would want to slash my throat every time I picked up a razor. Every time I looked out of a high window I wanted to jump out. I am a sick man <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> own protection and for the protection of my loved ones I want to be locked up and be placed where I can harm neither myself or anyone else". Wedge believed his condition was caused by damage caused by a frontal skull fracture sustained in a saloon fight about 1899, and exacerbated by the stress caused by the publicity surrounding his wedding and resignation from the church.|$|E
2500|$|Cricket {{historian}} J Neville Turner said: [...] "Miller’s Luck is {{up there}} with the great cricket biographies. The sensitive areas are handled with integrity and discretion." [...] Ron Reed, leading Australian sports writer, in a syndicated piece for all News Corporation tabloids including the Melbourne Herald Sun wrote: ‘Miller’s Luck is an excellent biography. It’s an honest portrayal of the imperfect human being behind the heroic legend.’ AAP’s Jim Morton wrote: ‘Keith Miller is an enlightening biography of the test all-rounder, who was a cool and carefree match-winner on the field and a playboy philanderer off it.’ Jim Rosenthal in the UK Daily Mail ranked the book as the number one sports book of 2006. The UK Cricket Society named it as the cricket biography of the year and it was short-listed for the Cricket Writers’ book of the Year. Archie Mac on Cricket Web’s book review wrote: ‘This is Roland Perry’s eighth book on cricket, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> money his best…the result is not just a great cricketing book, but also a complete portrait of a fascinating life.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Mulroney and Schreiber {{question}} each other's truthfulness and credibility. In {{his testimony}} to the Canadian House of Commons Ethics Committee on December 13, 2007, Mulroney pointed out contradictory statements Schreiber has made over the years, including statements made under oath. Mulroney also stated that the work he had performed for his arms-trading business associate Schreiber was out-of-country, rather than lobbying his own Canadian government – such as lobbying the late President Boris Yeltsin that Russia buy arms yet {{to be made in}} Canada. Schreiber had been incarcerated in Canada following his 1999 arrest on a German warrant for tax evasion, and is currently (June 2008) free on bail. Mulroney did not declare the income or pay taxes on it until years later, when Schreiber had come under criminal investigation in Germany. Erik Nielsen, former Deputy Prime Minister for Mulroney, stated disbelief in Mulroney's account, and denied his credibility: [...] "I think there was a phrase that attached to Brian years ago where he was known as Lyin' Brian, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> own part, I believe that they're both in the same boat — Schreiber and Mulroney." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2007, a {{demo version}} of Montag's song [...] "Body Language" [...] was leaked on On Air with Ryan Seacrest, which {{featured}} an uncredited rapped verse by Montag's boyfriend Spencer Pratt. Montag has claimed she {{was unhappy with}} the leak, as the song was a [...] "joke" [...] {{and she did not}} want that to be the first thing people heard from her musically. Montag released the promo single, [...] "Higher" [...] along with an accompanying video shot by Pratt to iTunes on February 5, 2008. The song and the video immediately elicited a negative response from the online community. Two weeks later, a ballad titled [...] "No More" [...] was leaked online, and Montag later released it as a promotional single the following month. Two more songs, [...] "Fashion" [...] and [...] "One More Drink" [...] appeared on the internet in June 2008. Consequently, Montag released the extended plays Wherever I Am and Here She Is..., which were made up of previously leaked material. Following the album's release, Montag stated [...] "I've actually gone broke putting every dollar I've ever made and my heart and soul into this music. For me, I have a different appreciation, a different understanding, and a different love of my music <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> album than any other artist possibly could." [...] Montag later confirmed she spent nearly $2 million on the album. Initially, the album was to include Montag's debut single, [...] "Body Language", but the song was later removed from the final product. The album was eventually released on January 11, 2010 for digital download.|$|E
