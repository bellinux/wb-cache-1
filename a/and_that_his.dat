5|$|A well-educated landowning aristocrat, Edwards {{deliberately}} cultivated {{the image}} of the natural leader. Thomas Ford writes that he continued to dress like an 18th-century gentleman long after such fashions had gone out of style, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> public speaking was marked by showy eloquence. Edwards consciously positioned himself in the select class of men who dominated Kentucky and, later, Illinois politics. In 1803 in Russellville, Edwards married Elvira Lane, a relative from Maryland.|$|E
5|$|According to Capitol Record's A, Joe Weinberger, he was {{approached}} by West and almost signed a deal with him, but another person in the company convinced Capitol's president not to. Desperate to keep West from defecting to another label, then-label head Damon Dash reluctantly signed West to Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z later admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, claiming that many saw him as a producer first and foremost, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> background contrasted with that of his labelmates.|$|E
5|$|According to Robert K. Massie and Lindsey Hughes, Peter told Zotov in October 1713 that he {{intended}} to have him marry a second time, to Anna Pashkova, a widow 50 years Zotov's junior, despite Zotov's wish to spend his final years in a monastery. However, the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary and Sergey Solovyov say that Zotov {{came up with the idea}} to marry Pashkova in 1714, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> plan to become a monk was merely a joke.|$|E

5|$|According to Tanaka, the Beach Boys were {{repeatedly}} referenced {{between him}} and Suzuki, {{and that he would}} often listen to co-founder Brian Wilson's 1988 eponymous album while on the way to Suzuki's home. Suzuki has stated that the percussive arranging in the game's soundtrack was based on the Beach Boys' albums Smile (unreleased) and Smiley Smile (1967), which both contained American themes shared with Van Dyke Parks' Song Cycle (1968). To Suzuki, Smile evoked the bright and dark aspects of America, while Song Cycle displayed a hazy sound mixed with American humor and hints of Ray Bradbury, a style which he considered essential to the soundtrack of Mother. Tanaka recalls Randy Newman being the first quintessentially American composer he could think of, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> albums Little Criminals (1977) and Land of Dreams (1988) were influential. While Suzuki corroborated with his own affinity for Harry Nilsson's Nilsson Sings Newman (1970), he also cited John Lennon as a strong influence due to the common theme of love in his music, which was also a prominent theme in the game, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970) helped him to avoid excessive instrumentation over the SNES's technical constraints.|$|E

5|$|As word {{increased}} of Bayh's intentions, {{political scientists}} opined on the detractions of a run. Citing {{the fact that}} his eight years as governor may be nullified by its distance in time <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> visibility in the Senate was low, critics pondered whether moderate voters may be more inclined to line with possible candidate Mark Warner of Virginia. However, this criticism subsided once Warner decided against a run in October 2006.|$|E
