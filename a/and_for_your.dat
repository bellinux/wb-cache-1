25|$|Britain's {{most famous}} spy, James Bond, {{generally}} spends {{little time in}} London, other than to receive his orders from his boss 'M'. However, some of the films do feature locations in the city. These include On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) (#1 in U.S.) in which George Lazenby as Bond visits the College of Arms <b>and</b> <b>For</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes Only (1981) (#1 in U.S.), in which Roger Moore experiences a hair-raising helicopter flight over the Docklands area. In the more recent Pierce Brosnan films, the Secret Service's headquarters are identified as being the new MI6 building on the River Thames at Vauxhall. The 1999 film The World Is Not Enough (#1 in U.S.) opens with an extended boat chase from the MI6 building down the river to the Millennium Dome, while in Die Another Day (2002) (#1 in U.S.) Bond visits a secret base in a disused Underground station, and makes a rare trip to his club Blades. Also in the 2012 Bond movie Skyfall (#1 in U.S.), Bond spends more time in London. First while he visits M's house {{to get back to}} service. Then to new underground office of MI6, then to the Art Gallery to meet the new Quartermaster. After returning from Shanghai also, Bond spends time in London before going to Scotland. He chases Silva in London Tube and other areas in London. Also at the end of Movie, Bond sees London from his office terrace. The 1967 version of Casino Royale makes extensive use of London locations, including 10 Downing Street, Whitehall, Trafalgar Square (with Nelson's Column replaced by a flying saucer) as well as the Changing of the Guard outside Buckingham Palace.|$|E

500|$|Until A View to a Kill, {{the title}} of the next film to be {{produced}} was also usually named, in the format [...] "James Bond will return..." [...] or [...] "James Bond will be back", although these were sometimes incorrect: The Spy Who Loved Me promised James Bond would return in For Your Eyes Only, but after the success of Star Wars, the producers decided to make Moonraker instead <b>and</b> <b>For</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes Only followed in 1981.|$|E
500|$|Richard Maibaum {{was once}} again the {{scriptwriter}} for the story, assisted by Michael G. Wilson. According to Wilson, the ideas from stories {{could have come from}} anyone as the outlines were worked out in committee that could include Broccoli, Maibaum, Wilson and stunt coordinators. Much of the inspiration for the stories for the film came from two Ian Fleming short stories from the collection For Your Eyes Only: Risico <b>and</b> <b>For</b> <b>Your</b> Eyes Only. Another set-piece from the novel of Live and Let Die – the keelhauling – which was unused in the film of the same name, was also inserted into the plot. Other ideas from Fleming were also used in For Your Eyes Only, such as the Identigraph which comes from the novel Goldfinger, where it was originally called the [...] "Identicast". These elements from Fleming's stories were mixed with a Cold War story centred on the macguffin of the ATAC. An initial treatment for “For Your Eyes Only” was submitted by Ronald Hardy, an English novelist and screenwriter in 1979. Hardy’s treatment included the involvement of a character named Julia Havelock whose parents were assassinated by a man named Gonzales.|$|E
500|$|In the New Testament, the messianic {{expectations}} {{found in}} early Judaism were fulfilled {{on the day}} of Pentecost as recorded in Acts. The Christian community was gathered together in Jerusalem when a sound from heaven like rushing wind was heard and tongues like tongues of flame rested on everyone. They were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues, miraculously praising God in foreign languages. A crowd gathered and was addressed by the Apostle Peter who stated that the occurrence was the fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel 2, [...] "And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy". He then explained how the Spirit came to be poured out, recounting Jesus’ ministry and passion and then proclaiming his resurrection and enthronement at the right hand of God. In response, the crowd asked Peter what they should do. He responded that they should repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of sins in order to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Peter finished his speech stating that the promise [...] "is for you <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself".|$|E

2500|$|Reading [...] the 20th century Israeli scholar Nechama Leibowitz {{wrote that}} people in their {{blindness}} tend to detect the guiding hand of Providence only when manifested in visible miracles, as the Israelites witnessed in the wilderness.

For this reason, the formulators of the liturgy obliged Jews to give thanks three times daily (in the final benedictions of the Amidah prayer) [...] "for Your miracles that are with us every day <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>Your</b> wonders and Your bounties that are at all times, evening, morning, and noon." ...|$|E

2500|$|The British {{version of}} the two-disc DVD {{contains}} two additional deleted scenes. In the first, Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem (at the eighth station of the cross) and {{falls to the ground}} as the women wail around him, and Simon of Cyrene attempts to hold up the cross and help up Jesus simultaneously. Afterwards, while both are holding up the cross, Jesus says to the women weeping for him, [...] "Do not weep for me, but for yourselves <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> children". In the second, Pilate washes his hands, turns to Caiaphas, and says: [...] "Look you to it" [...] (i.e., the Pharisees wish to have Jesus crucified). Pilate then turns to Abanader and says: [...] "Do as they wish". The scene next shows Pilate calling to his servant, who is carrying a wooden board on which Pilate writes, [...] "Jesus of Nazareth king of the Jews", in Latin and Hebrew. He then holds the board above his head in full view of Caiaphas, who after reading it challenges Pilate on its content. Pilate replies angrily to Caiaphas in non-subtitled Hebrew.
