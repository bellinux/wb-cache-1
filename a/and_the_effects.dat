5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} damping, {{also called}} photon diffusion damping, {{is a physical}} process which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) in the early universe, making the universe itself and {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E
5|$|Information {{about the}} {{structure}} and function {{of the human brain}} comes from a variety of experimental methods, including animals and humans. Information about brain trauma and stroke has provided information about the function of parts of the brain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of brain damage. Neuroimaging is used to visualise the brain and record brain activity. Electrophysiology is used to measure, record and monitor the electrical activity of the cortex. Measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas, or of the activity of a single neuron. An electroencephalogram can record the electrical activity of the cortex using electrodes placed non-invasively on the scalp.|$|E
