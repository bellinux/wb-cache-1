40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if the Crithidia luciliae assay for auto‐antibodies to double‐stranded DNA, often positive in systemic lupus erythematosus, is always negative in <b>auto‐immune</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>active</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (CAH) as has recently been suggested. Twenty‐five patients were identified as having auto‐immune CAH. Mean duration of follow‐up was 10. 5 years. Antinuclear antibodies were detected in 92 %, smooth muscle antibodies in 76 % and antimitochondrial antibodies in 16 %. Antibodies to double‐stranded DNA were detected by the Crithidia assay in four patients (16 %). Two of these patients had positive tests on only one occasion and no features of systemic lupus erythematosus. In the other two the assay was persistently positive. During follow‐up both developed arthritis and serositis but the liver lesion remained the dominant clinical feature. It was concluded that there is significant serological overlap between auto‐immune CAH and systemic lupus erythematosus making the Crithidia assay unreliable in distinguishing between them.

We have previously demonstrated no differences of T-lymphocyte subsets in blood between inactive hepatitis B s antigen (HBsAg) carriers and patients with HBeAg-negative <b>chronic</b> <b>active</b> <b>hepatitis</b> B. This study investigated the peripheral blood cytokine profile in patients with HBeAg-negative <b>chronic</b> <b>active</b> <b>hepatitis</b> B infection (Group A, n = 21) and inactive HBsAg carriers (Group B, n = 13). Serum cytokines [interferon (IFN) -&#x 3 B 3;, tumor necrosis factor-&#x 3 B 1;, interleukin (IL) - 1 b, IL- 4, IL- 12, IL- 10, IL- 2, IL- 5, IL- 8] were analyzed by using flow cytometry. Patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>active</b> disease presented with significantly decreased levels of IFN-&#x 3 B 3; and IL- 10 compared to inactive carriers (P = 0. 048 and P = 0. 008, respectively).

Eleven patients who had active disease had significantly higher soluble IL 2 R concentrations (590 (89) U/ml) than the five cases with inactive disease (220 (36) U/ml, p less than 0. 01). No difference was found between the controls and the patients with chronic liver disease due to hepatitis B infection, Wilson's disease, and alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency.
