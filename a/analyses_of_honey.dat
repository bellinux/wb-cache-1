40|$|Honey bee colonies {{are subject}} to {{numerous}} pathogens and parasites. Interaction among multiple pathogens and parasites is the proposed cause for Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), a syndrome characterized by worker bees abandoning their hive. Here we provide the first documentation that the phorid fly Apocephalus borealis, previously known to parasitize bumble bees, also infects and eventually kills honey bees and may pose an emerging threat to North American apiculture. Parasitized honey bees show hive abandonment behavior, leaving their hives at night and dying shortly thereafter. On average, seven days later up to 13 phorid larvae emerge from each dead bee and pupate away from the bee. Using DNA barcoding, we confirmed that phorids that emerged from honey bees and bumble bees were the same species. Microarray <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> bees from infected hives revealed that these bees are often infected with deformed wing virus and Nosema ceranae.

40|$|Populations {{of honey}} bees and other pollinators have {{declined}} worldwide in recent years. A variety of stressors have been implicated as potential causes, including agricultural pesticides. Neonicotinoid insecticides, which {{are widely used}} and highly toxic to honey bees, {{have been found in}} previous <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> bee pollen and comb material. However, the routes of exposure have remained largely undefined. We used LC/MS-MS to analyze samples of honey bees, pollen stored in the hive and several potential exposure routes associated with plantings of neonicotinoid treated maize. Our results demonstrate that bees are exposed to these compounds and several other agricultural pesticides in several ways throughout the foraging period. During spring, extremely high levels of clothianidin and thiamethoxam were found in planter exhaust material produced during the planting of treated maize seed. We also found neonicotinoids in the soil of each field we sampled, including unplanted fields. Plants visited by foraging bees (dandelions) growing near these fields were found to contain neonicotinoids as well. This indicates deposition of neonicotinoids on the flowers, uptake by the root system, or both. Dead bees collected near hive entrances during the spring sampling period were found to contain clothianidin as well, although whether exposure was oral (consuming pollen) or by contact (soil/planter dust) is unclear. We also detected the insecticide clothianidin in pollen collected by bees and stored in the hive.

40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is a {{comparison}} of selected quality indicators of samples from single-flower honeys from {{the area of the}} Czech Republic and honeys from different retail chains. The theoretical part focuses on the characteristics of the individual kinds <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> and how different their composition is. There are described basic physical and chemical requirements for honey including sensory requirements which are specified in Regulation No. 76 / 2003 Code. The practical part contains a physically-chemical analysis according to the Harmonized methods <b>of</b> European <b>Honey</b> and a sensory evaluation <b>of</b> selected single-flower <b>honeys</b> (honeydew, acacia, lime, sunflower and rape). There were <b>analysed</b> twenty samples <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> from Czech beekeepers and fifteen samples <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> bought in different retail chains in the Czech Republic.

The conclusion of the comparison <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> samples indicates that individual honey samples differed the most in the taste and smell criteria and in addition the samples were often disrupted by starchy sugar and malt extracts. The samples collected from the beekeepers from the area of the Czech Republic complied with Regulation No. 76 / 2003 Code.

40|$|Melissopalynology (pollen {{analysis}} of honey) is an indispensable method to authenticate honey origin and characteristics. It is very effective to determine {{and control the}} geographical origin of honeys and it also provides information about other important quality aspects. Melissopalynologists are challenged not only to identify the pollen found in honey but also {{decide what to do}} with the presence of pollen grains that are represented in the honey spectra. Pollen <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> can also determine important information about honeybees such as foraging ecology, habitat and vegetation visited, changes in food sources and habitat composition. The advantages of a pollen analysis is that all, or most, nectar sources involved are recognised, and if quantitative data are available, their relationship to each component, or to the dominant source, can be determined. Pollen spectra gave consistent results for the same type of honey from different areas. The large variety of meliferous sources (223) enable in Romania to produce characteristic type of honeys. The interest in the production of unifloral honeys is a higher consumer preference for some honey varieties leading to a commercial interest of the beekeepers. In six sample of commercial unifloral honey, 16 pollen types were identified. These honeys are not especially rich in pollen types and compares with many honeys characteristic of Europe. Plantago pollen grains are irregularly found in these honeys, as elsewhere, although their numbers in any one sample are insignificant. The presence of this pollen type is considered accidental, especially as numbers are always low. Comparison of results from samples extracted by different methods is impossible, for absolute pollen content may vary greatly...|$|E

30|$|When the {{parameters}} are <b>analysed,</b> segregation <b>of</b> the <b>honeys</b> {{into two groups}} was evident {{on the basis of}} conductivity with a discrimination value of 0.3. The electrical conductivity <b>of</b> the <b>honey</b> is closely related to the concentrations of mineral salts, organic acids and proteins, and it has proven to be useful to discriminate <b>honeys</b> <b>of</b> different floral origins (Mateo and Bosch-Reig 1998; Terrab et al. 2002 a, b, 2004) and a good indicator of geographic origin (Anklam 1998; Acquarone 2004; Acquarone et al. 2007). Generally, a high conductivity is correlated with a high ash content and it corresponds to the darkest honeys. Here we observed different conductivity in the thyme monofloral <b>honeys</b> <b>of</b> the same geographic region but in areas with different substrates. Consequently, the physicochemical characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>honeys</b> are closely related to a specific floristic composition and soil type. This supports earlier conclusions from a global study of the minerals present in honey (Feller-Demalsy et al. 1989; Bogdanov et al. 2008), where good electrical conductivity was valued and the mineral content was related to the botanical origin, the soil-climatic conditions and the extraction techniques used to obtain the product. The honeys with the greatest conductivity correspond to apiaries located in gypsum soils, with specific and endemic vegetation (gypsophytes), while those with lower conductivity correspond to honey samples from apiaries located on limestone.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to use {{melissopalynology}} to delineate the foraging preferences of bees in tropical environs. This was done by comparing pollen spectra obtained from the same hives every three months for three years at four sampling locations (in two sites) within a confined landscape mosaic. If melissopalynology is highly replicable, the spatial variation of the pollen spectrum from the honey samples would be much more than the temporal (inter-annual) variations. In other words, given the three factors, Month, Year and Location, honey pollen from different Locations, in a given Year and Month, would be much less similar than samples from different Years, in a given Location and Month. We then determined how the factors, Month, Year and Location, influenced the pollen influx <b>of</b> <b>honey.</b> The pollen <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> the 42 <b>honey</b> samples collected during the three years yielded 80 pollen taxa/types: 72 dicotyledonous and 8 monocotyledonous, encompassing 41 botanical families spread into seven life forms namely, trees, shrubs, epiphytes, herbs, climbers, grasses, and sedges. Our results showed that pollen spectra were equally comparable between Locations and between Months and Years; the importance of this result is that it helped to demonstrate the complexity of ecological/environmental phenomena involved in the process of foraging by bees in a heterogeneous and complex landscape...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{analytical}} {{composition and}} botanical origin <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> are basic data {{used to determine}} the quality of this foodstuff. Although proteins are used to characterise the analytical composition <b>of</b> <b>honey,</b> they can be eliminated during its ultrafiltration and, in the case <b>of</b> <b>honeys</b> not saturated with their own pollen, the use of proteins does not work well. As acidity is a well-known characteristic <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> and organic acids are present at around 0. 5 % in honey, we therefore investigated an alternative method to the protein-based White method, using organic acids as new internal standards instead of proteins. The qualitative and quantitative <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> 14 organic acids were carried out by ion chromatography with an electrochemical detector. The 13 C/ 12 C isotopic ratios <b>of</b> the <b>honeys,</b> and <b>of</b> the organic acids extracted from them with an anion exchange resin, were determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{microscopic}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> and its use in the evaluation and testing <b>of</b> <b>honey.</b> The work is divided into theoretical and practical parts. The theoretical part {{is devoted to the}} analysis of pollen and physical and chemical methods of determining the type <b>of</b> <b>honey.</b> The practical part describes the results and compares them. 22 honey samples originating from beekeepers has been shown 17 beekeepers false claims about their type <b>of</b> <b>honey.</b> <b>Of</b> the 7 aldulterated honeys, 4 samples were violated by foreign particles from the environment. Further honeys from the market containing suspicious particles and very critically low pollen grains in 1 g <b>of</b> <b>honey,</b> which points to a adulteration <b>of</b> <b>honey.</b> Unifloral honeys from Olomouc were found honey from satureja (S/ 2) and lavandula (F/ 1) containing neither one pollen grain of these plants...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{is focused on the}} {{antioxidant}} capacity and chemical profiling of eight Croatian Satureja Montana L. honey samples. Among the 20 compounds obtained by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and identified by GC-FID and GC/MS analyses, hotrienol was predominant (75. 9 - 81. 7 %). The honey matrix volatile/semivolatile profile was investigated by ultrasonic solvent extraction (USE) followed by GC-FID and GC/MS analyses. The major compounds identified by this latter method were the sinapic-acid derivatives methyl syringate (36. 2 - 72. 8 %) and syringaldehyde (2. 2 - 43. 1 %). Direct, targeted HPLC-DAD <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> the native <b>honey</b> samples revealed the presence of methyl syringate (7. 10 - 39. 60 mg/kg) and syringic acid (0. 10 - 1. 70 mg/kg). In addition, the total phenolic content of the samples was determined by the Folin£Ciocalteu assay (311. 0 - 465. 9 mg GAE/kg), and the antioxidant capacity was evaluated by the DPPH radical-scavenging activity (0. 5 - 1. 0 mmol TEAC/kg) and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (2. 5 - 5. 1 mmol Fe 2 +/kg...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} this diploma thesis is to {{evaluate}} the impact of grazing on the quality <b>of</b> bee <b>honey.</b> The theoretical part focuses {{on the characteristics of}} the individual kinds <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> and their different compositions. The fundamental physical and chemical requirements for honey are described there, including a sensory requirement, which indicates Public Notice No. 76 / 2003 Coll. The practical part contains the physico-chemical analysis itself, according to the Harmonised methods <b>of</b> the European <b>Honey.</b> The two fundamental kinds <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> were evaluated, i. e. blossom and honeydew <b>honey.</b> Each type <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> was represented by 20 samples. Subsequently, the following parameters were monitored: water content, acidity, pH, electrical conductivity, content of water-insoluble substances and also the test for the evidence <b>of</b> damage <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> structure by starch syrup was done. The comparison of the samples shows that the different types <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> vary mostly in the parameter of electrical conductivity. The final results show that the different bee grazing does not impact the quality <b>of</b> <b>honey...</b>|$|R
