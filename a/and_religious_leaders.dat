5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of inhabitants in the Rhondda prior to industrialisation, there are few residents of note before the valleys became a coal mining area. The earliest individuals {{to come to the}} fore were linked with the coal industry and the people; physical men who found {{a way out of the}} Rhondda through sport; charismatic orators who led the miners through unions or political <b>and</b> <b>religious</b> <b>leaders</b> who tended to the deeply religious chapel going public.|$|E

5|$|As part {{of their}} program to {{suppress}} Polish culture, the German Nazis attempted to destroy Christianity in Poland, with a particular emphasis on the Roman Catholic Church.

The worst conditions {{were found in the}} Reichsgau Wartheland, which the Nazis treated as a laboratory for their anti-religious policies.
