5|$|Artificial trees made of goose {{feathers}} were {{in use in}} <b>American</b> <b>homes</b> {{since the}} 1880s. In the 1930s, however, The Addis Brush Company, an American toilet bowl brush manufacturer, began making artificial trees of green-dyed bristles and then supplied the British (who suffered a dearth of wild trees) with thousands of artificial trees in the post-War years. Americans took {{little interest in the}} Addis artificial trees and remained loyal to real trees.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, {{only one}} in five American {{families}} had a Christmas tree. While America never lacked for real trees, the time and expense of retrieving them from the wild was significant. Early in the twentieth century, however, Christmas tree farms began supplying large metropolitan areas with real trees. In the 1920s, real trees became commonplace, supplanting artificial trees in <b>American</b> <b>homes.</b>|$|E

The lawsuit alleged that MRIS’s lawsuit against <b>American</b> <b>Home</b> Realty Network and Northstar MLS's lawsuit against <b>American</b> <b>Home</b> Realty Network in Minnesota were attempts to drive <b>American</b> <b>Home</b> Realty Network out of business and eliminate it as a competitor {{in the market for}} real estate broker services.

5|$|The Sopranos {{was a major}} ratings success, {{despite being}} aired on premium cable network HBO which is {{available}} in significantly fewer <b>American</b> <b>homes</b> than regular networks. The show frequently attracted equal or larger audiences than most popular network shows of the time. Nielsen ratings {{for the first four}} seasons are not entirely accurate, however, as Nielsen reported aggregate numbers for cable networks prior to January 2004, meaning that people who were included in the ratings estimates were actually watching HBO channels other than the main one on which The Sopranos aired.|$|E
5|$|Human {{attitudes toward}} insects are often negative, {{reinforced}} by sensationalism in the media. This {{has produced a}} society that attempts to eliminate insects from daily life. For example, nearly 75 million pounds of broad-spectrum insecticides are manufactured and sold each year for use in <b>American</b> <b>homes</b> and gardens. Annual revenues from insecticide sales to homeowners exceeded $450 million in 2004. Out of the roughly a million species of insects described so far, not more than 1,000 {{can be regarded as}} serious pests, and less than 10,000 (about 1%) are even occasional pests. Yet not one species of insect has been permanently eradicated through the use of pesticides. Instead, at least 1,000 species have developed field resistance to pesticides, and extensive harm has been done to beneficial insects including pollinators such as bees.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{stations}} in the United States often broadcast popular music. Each music station has a format, or a category of songs to be played; these are generally similar to but {{not the same as}} ordinary generic classification. Many radio {{stations in}} the United States are locally owned and operated, and may offer an eclectic assortment of recordings; many other stations are owned by large companies like Clear Channel, and are generally formatted on smaller, more repetitive playlists. Commercial sales of recordings are tracked by Billboard magazine, which compiles a number of music charts for various fields of recorded music sales. The Billboard Hot 100 is the top pop music chart for singles, a recording consisting of a handful of songs; longer pop recordings are albums, and are tracked by the Billboard 200. Though recorded music is commonplace in <b>American</b> <b>homes,</b> many of the music industry's revenue comes from a small number of devotees; for example, 62% of album sales come from less than 25% of the music-buying audience. Total CD sales in the United States topped 705 million units sold in 2005, and singles sales just under three million.|$|E

25|$|Poor {{housing quality}} and low incomes {{contributes}} to fuel poverty, a phenomenomen {{that is more}} common among lower-income household than among households in general. Over the past decade home energy costs have risen in <b>American</b> <b>homes</b> in general. For low-income households this cost increase is even more pressing, for which home energy expenditures can {{be as high as}} a fifth of household income and {{more than a quarter of}} total housing costs. For that reason, improving energy efficiency has been pointed out as one of the challenges for American housing by the Joint Center for Housing Studies.|$|E
25|$|The plant {{provides}} {{electricity to}} northern Illinois {{and the city}} of Chicago.

The Byron plant has been subject to some controversy with respect to a lawsuit in 1981 with concerns over tritium contamination in groundwater. Tritium contamination at Byron and other Illinois nuclear power plants led the state of Illinois to pass legislation requiring plants to report such contamination to the state within 24hours.

25|$|Cheiracanthium inclusum, {{alternately}} {{known as}} the black-footed yellow sac spider or the American yellow sac spider (in order to distinguish it from its European cousin C. punctorium), was formerly classified as a true sac spider (of the family Clubionidae), and then placed in the family Miturgidae, but now belongs to family Eutichuridae. It is a rather small pale yellow species that is indigenous to the Americas {{and can be found}} living in the foliage of forests and gardens but also can inhabit human homes. Despite common beliefs of necrosis, Cheiracanthium bites cause only localized swelling. C. inclusum is closely related to Cheiracanthium mildei, an introduced species native to Europe which is similar in appearance and natural history and can also be found in North <b>American</b> <b>homes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Each {{cremation}} uses about 28 {{gallons of}} fuel and releases about 540 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thus, the roughly 1 million bodies that are cremated annually in the United States produce ~270,000 tons of carbon dioxide. That’s more CO2 pollution than 22,000 average <b>American</b> <b>homes</b> generate in a year. The environmental impact may be reduced by using cremators for longer periods, and not cremating {{on the same day}} as the coffin is received, which reduces the use of fossil fuel and hence carbon emissions. Cremation is therefore becoming more friendly toward the environment though natural burials are also possible. Some funeral and crematorium owners offer a carbon neutral funeral service incorporating efficient-burning coffins made from lightweight recycled composite board.|$|E
25|$|As the Nintendo Entertainment System grew in {{popularity}} and entered millions of <b>American</b> <b>homes,</b> some small video rental shops began buying their own copies of NES games, and renting {{them out to}} customers for around the same price as a video cassette rental for a few days. Nintendo received no profit from the practice beyond the initial cost of their game, and unlike movie rentals, a newly released game could hit store shelves and be available for rent on the same day. Nintendo took steps to stop game rentals, but didn't take any formal legal action until Blockbuster Video began to make game rentals a large-scale service. Nintendo claimed that allowing customers to rent games would significantly hurt sales and drive {{up the cost of}} games. Nintendo lost the lawsuit, but did win on a claim of copyright infringement. Blockbuster was banned from including original, copyrighted instruction booklets with their rented games. In compliance with the ruling, Blockbuster produced their own short instructions—usually {{in the form of a}} small booklet, card, or label stuck on the back of the rental box—that explained the game's basic premise and controls. Video rental shops continued the practice of renting video games and still do today.|$|E

25|$|Under her {{editorial}} management {{it proved}} the swiftest journalistic success on record, numbering its subscribers by the hundred thousand, and while other papers took {{a loss for}} granted in the beginning, putting itself upon a paying basis at the outset. While she had assistants in every department, among their names those of some most distinguished in our literature, she was herself the inspiration of the whole corps, and under the advice and suggestion of its proprietors she held it on an even course. There was scarcely a poet, or a story-writer, or novelist of any rank in America or England {{who is not a}} contributor to its pages, and its purity, its self-respect, its high standard, and its literary excellence, were unrivalled among periodical publications.
