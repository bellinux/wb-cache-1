5|$|Youtsey, who {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>sentence,</b> did not appeal, {{but after two}} years in prison, he turned state's evidence. In Howard's second trial, Youtsey claimed that ex-governor Taylor had discussed an assassination plot with Youtsey and Howard. He backed the prosecution's claims that Taylor and Powers worked out the details, he acted as an intermediary, and Howard fired the shot. On cross examination, the defense pointed out contradictions {{in the details of}} Youtsey's story, but Howard was still convicted. Youtsey was paroled in 1916 and was pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor James D. Black.|$|E

5|$|Gordimer's {{homage to}} Fischer extends to using {{excerpts}} from his writings and public {{statements in the}} book. Lionel Burger's treason trial speech from the dock is taken from the speech Fischer gave at his own trial in 1966. Fischer {{was the leader of}} the banned SACP who was given <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> for furthering the aims of communism and conspiracy to overthrow the government. Quoting people like Fischer was not permitted in South Africa.

5|$|Giuseppe Elia Pace, an {{advocate}} and {{close friend of}} Mikiel Anton Vassalli, {{was found guilty of}} treason during the reign of de Rohan and was sentenced for flogging in Valletta followed by a permanent exile out of Malta.

Vassalli denied the accusations and remained imprisoned. Meanwhile, he received visits from the father of Fortunato Panzavecchia.

40|$|In 1965, {{alongside}} {{the abolition of}} capital punishment, <b>a</b> mandatory <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> for murder was implemented in England and Wales. The mandatory <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> served as <b>a</b> signal {{to the public that}} the criminal justice system would still implement the most severe sanction of life imprisonment in cases of murder. Nearly 50 years later, this article examines whether the imposition of <b>a</b> mandatory <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> for murder is still {{in the best interests of}} justice or whether English homicide law would be better served by a discretionary sentencing system. In doing so, the article considers debates surrounding the political and public need for <b>a</b> mandatory <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> for murder by drawing upon interviews conducted with 29 members of the English criminal justice system. This research concludes that a discretionary sentencing framework is required to adequately respond to the many contexts within which the crime of murder is committed...|$|R

5|$|On 7 June 2010, Van der Sloot {{reportedly}} {{confessed to}} killing Flores, {{after hours of}} interrogation. He initially proclaimed his innocence.

The prosecution was seeking a sentence of 30 years. Peru does not issue life sentences in standard cases of murder and has abolished capital punishment in all but exceptional circumstances, such as crimes committed under military law. <b>A</b> <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> can be issued for a murder committed during the commission of a robbery.

5|$|Allegations {{were made}} {{against the state}} police, state {{government}} and the chief minister Narendra Modi, citing that government authorities were involved and various police personnel {{played a role in}} the massacre: a number of eyewitnesses reported police officers favouring the mob by allegedly injuring or killing Muslims and damaging public and private property. All allegations were proved to be false and the government and police were cleared of wrongdoing by a Special Investigation Team. The initial report on the case was filed by the Gujarat police, accusing 46 people, all of whom the Special Court deemed unreliable. In 2008, the Supreme Court of India formed a Special Investigation Team to investigate the case. In 2009, the team submitted its report, which accused 70 people of wrongdoing, 61 of whom were charged. On 29 August 2012, the Special Court convicted 32 people and acquitted 29 due to insufficient evidence.

5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>sentence</b> or death by lethal injection. Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters asked if she was responsible for Fischer's murder, and she shook her head. Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but her attorney said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and deserved bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest was a mistake, and that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by saying they were content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they hoped it was a mistake, and {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. Her attorney reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that she deserved a bond as well because she was a senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{continued}} {{to be interested in}} aviation, learning to fly the more advanced aircraft that were coming into development at the start of World War II. On 10 May 1941 he undertook a solo flight to Scotland, where he hoped to arrange peace talks with the Duke of Hamilton, whom he believed to be prominent in opposition to the British government. Hess was immediately arrested on his arrival and was held in British custody {{until the end of the}} war, when he was returned to Germany to stand trial in the Nuremberg Trials of major war criminals in 1946. During much of the trial, he claimed to be suffering from amnesia, but later admitted this was a ruse. Hess was convicted of crimes against peace and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes and was transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947, where he served <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>sentence.</b> Repeated attempts by family members and prominent politicians to win him early release were blocked by the Soviet Union. Still in custody in Spandau, he died by suicide in 1987 at the age of 93. After his death the prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Osiel {{was arrested}} in Matamoros {{following}} a shootout with the Mexican military, and was extradited to the United States in 2007. In exchange for <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>sentence,</b> Osiel cooperated with the U.S. authorities by supplying information on {{the workings of the}} Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas. When Osiel was arrested, Antonio Ezequiel inherited the Gulf Cartel along with Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, a former policeman in Matamoros. He and other Gulf Cartel leaders were responsible for trafficking multi-ton drug shipments of cocaine and marijuana from Mexico to the United States. Antonio Ezequiel received a federal indictment in 2008 in the District of Columbia for drug trafficking violations. He also directed the flow of narcotics through land, sea, and air from Venezuela and Colombia to Guatemala and the U.S-Mexico border. When Osiel was imprisoned, several high-ranking lieutenants in the Gulf Cartel got together to appoint leaders and their turfs. According to the declarations of Zeta leader Mateo Díaz López (alias Comandante Mateo), Antonio Ezequiel was given the turf of Matamoros, one of the leading smuggling routes for the cartel. But Antonio Ezequiel never had the edge; one of his most trusted men, Ramiro García Hernández (alias El Mati), {{was arrested in}} 2004. Deemed inexperienced, Costilla Sánchez, Lazcano, and high-ranking leader Víctor Manuel Vázquez Mireles (alias El Meme Loco) moved Antonio Ezequiel to command the Gulf Cartel in Cancún. But after failing to meet the Gulf Cartel's demands, he was replaced.|$|E
