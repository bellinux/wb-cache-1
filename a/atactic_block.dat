40|$|A novel {{synthetic}} pathway toward stereoblock copolymers {{by combining}} catalytic chain transfer polymerization with anionic polymerization is described. Catalytic chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) {{has been used}} to synthesize vinyl-terminated polymers, which, after the Michael addition of a-lithioisopropyl isobutyrate, were used as macroinitiators for the anionic polymerization of methacrylate-type monomers. The resultant polymer consists of a predominantly <b>atactic</b> <b>block</b> (originating from the free radical polymerization) and a more isotactoid or syndiotactoid block (originating from the anionic polymerization) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{new class}} of titanium(IV) {{complexes}} bearing two phenoxy-azo ligands was synthesized. The Ti−N bonds from X-ray structures were longer than those of corresponding bis(phenoxy-imine) titanium(IV) complexes, which indicates that the coordination of phenoxy-azo ligands becomes weaker on replacing the imine carbon by nitrogen. These titanium complexes were applied for the polymerization of styrene using DMAO as cocatalyst, and syndiotactic polystyrene was obtained. Premixing DMAO with the titanium complex resulted in higher activity, similar to the related bis(phenoxy-imine) titanium(IV) com-plexes. The coordinating azobenzene subunits did not undergo E → Z photoisomerization upon UV irradiation. Stereoblock homopolymers often show different characteristics as compared to stereoregular polymers. For example, isotactic polypropylene containing <b>atactic</b> interior <b>blocks</b> has been reported by Coates and Waymouth to show elastic properties. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{morphological}} {{study was}} performed with symmetric diblock ethylene-propylene copolymer (DEP) andthe binary blends made from DEP and atactic polypropylene (APP) {{by use of}} small angle X-ray, lightand neutron scattering, and also scanning and transmission electron microscopy. DEP containsa crystallizable polyethylene block and an amorphous <b>atactic</b> polypropylene <b>block.</b> Quenching the blendsin liquid nitrogen preserved the morphology in the melt state. This quenching technique revealed that DEPforms a lamellar microdomain structure and blending DEP and APP includes morphological changes in themicrodomain structures as well as macrophase separation. When the APP chain was shorter than the APPblock, the addition of APP changed the morphology from a lamellar to a bicontinuous cylindrical and then adiscrete cylindrical and finally to a spherical structure. On the other hand, when the APP chain was longerthan the APP block, macrophase separation was observed and only a transition from a lamella toa bicontinuous cylinder occurred. These morphological transitions in the melt state can be correlatedto differences in the crystallization kinetics of the blends...|$|R
40|$|Atactic poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) is a thermosensitive polymer in aqueous solutions. By modifying its {{structure}} with isotactic (i) rich blocks {{it has been}} shown that the thermal and structural properties of the solutions can be modified. For example, a triblock PNIPAM with isotactic endblocks forms hydrogels at temperatures close to room temperature. These gels phase separate at higher temperatures and dissolve when lowering the temperature. The rheological properties of PNIPAM polymers in water-acetone mixtures were investigated to see how the acetone content affects solution behaviour. Different arrangements of the <b>atactic</b> and isotactic <b>block</b> result in different complex viscosity as a function of temperature profiles and the block arrangement have an effect on the strength of the formed gel. It was also found that the acetone content influences the gelling behaviour of the PNIPAM systems to a large extent...|$|R
