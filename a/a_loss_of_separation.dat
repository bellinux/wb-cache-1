40|$|In {{air traffic}} management, {{conflict}} prevention information {{refers to the}} guidance maneuvers, which if taken, ensure that an aircraft’s path is conflict-free. These guidance maneuvers {{take the form of}} changes to track angle or ground speed. Conflict prevention information may be assembled into prevention bands that advise the crew on maneuvers that should not be taken. Unlike conflict resolution systems, which presume that the aircraft already has a conflict, conflict prevention systems show conflicts for any maneuver, giving the pilot confidence that if a maneuver is made, then no near-term conflicts will result. Because near-term conflicts can lead to safety concerns, strong verification of information correctness is required. This paper presents a mathematical framework to analyze the correctness of algorithms that produce conflict prevention information incorporating an arbitrary number of traffic aircraft and with both a near-term and intermediateterm lookahead times. The framework is illustrated with a formally verified algorithm for 2 -dimensional track angle prevention bands.

50|$|A {{conflict}} {{is an event}} in which two or more aircraft experience <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> minimum <b>separation.</b> This does not in itself suggest that the aircraft are at any risk of collision. However, the separation minima are set for risk mitigation and therefore it is central to a controller's job to prevent this situation from occurring. Conflicts are detected by data assistants, who report them to the actual controllers; the data assistants suggest how to solve the conflict, but the controller is not obligated to follow the suggested instructions. A conflict occurs when the distance between aircraft in flight violates a defining criterion, usually considered as 5 nautical miles (9 km) of horizontal and/or 1000 feet <b>of</b> vertical <b>separation.</b> These distances define an aircraft's protected zone, a volume of airspace surrounding the aircraft which should not be infringed upon by any other aircraft.|$|R

Hydraulic performance issues related to flow instability and classical flooding are likely unimportant, especially for units with high throughputs. However, annular mixing increases rapidly with increasing rotor diameter while maintaining a fixed g force at the rotor wall. In addition, for engineering/process-scale contactors, elevated rotor speeds and/or throughput rates, can lead to organic phase foaming at the rotor discharge collector area.

Synthetic and enhanced flight vision system technologies are critical enabling technologies to EVO. Current research evaluated concepts for flight deck-based interval management (FIM) operations, integrated with Synthetic Vision and Enhanced Vision flight-deck displays and technologies.

40|$|Best {{paper in}} track award. ATM Seminar Eurocontrol/FAA (2013 - 06 - 13) When an {{airliner}} and a Remotely Piloted Air System (RPAS) have conflicting courses that may compromise the minimum safety separation between them, how much in advance should the RPAS start the separation manoeuvre? Which is the optimal heading change that will guarantee the desired separation distance {{with a minimum}} reaction time? These same questions can be asked {{if it is the}} airliner that performs the separation manoeuvre. In this paper the time reaction margins for both aircraft are analysed assuming they are equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) systems able to exchange aircraft intents. Due to their small cruise speeds, RPAS manoeuvres must be initiated well before the airliner ones. This leads to some safety buffer in case the RPAS cannot comply with the required change of trajectory or if it becomes suddenly unresponsive (due to an internal failure or because a lost-link situation).

Traffic aircraft approaching from various azimuths and altitudes were periodically presented on a trajectory, which posed a collision threat to the pilot’s aircraft if a maneuver was not initiated. Maneuver choices were classified by the axis (vertical, lateral, airspeed) and direction within the axis and were analyzed in terms of their safety, operationally defined as the time spent with <b>a</b> predicted <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation.</b> Decision analysis revealed a strong tendency to use single-axis maneuvers, to prefer vertical over lateral maneuvers, to climb, rather than descend, and to avoid airspeed maneuvers.

40|$|International audienceThe Air Traffic Control (ATC) {{environment}} {{is complex and}} safety-critical. Whilst exchanging information with pilots, controllers must also be alert to visual notifications displayed {{on the radar screen}} (e. g. warning which indicates <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> minimum <b>separation</b> between aircraft). Under the assumption that attentional resources are shared between vision and hearing, the visual interface design may also impact the ability to process these auditory stimuli. Using a simulated ATC task, we compared the behavioral and neural responses to two different visual notification designs - the operational alarm that involves blinking colored “ALRT” displayed around the label of the notified plane (“Color-Blink”), and the more salient alarm involving the same blinking text plus four moving yellow chevrons (“Box-Animation”). Participants performed a concurrent auditory task with the requirement to react to rare pitch tones. P 300 from the occurrence of the tones was taken as an indicator of remaining attentional resources. Participants who were presented with the more salient visual design showed better accuracy than the group with the suboptimal operational design. On a physiological level, auditory P 300 amplitude in the former group was greater than that observed in the latter group. One potential explanation is that the enhanced visual design freed up attentional resources which, in turn, improved the cerebral processing of the auditory stimuli. These results suggest that P 300 amplitude {{can be used as a}} valid estimation of the efficiency of interface designs, and of cognitive load more generally...|$|R

The airspace was constrained {{by a pair of}} special-use airspace (SUA) regions {{on either side of the}} pilot's planned route. Traffic flow management (TFM) constraints were imposed as a required time of arrival and crossing altitude at an en route fix. Key guidelines from the RTCA Airborne Conflict Management (ACM) concept were applied to autonomous aircraft operations for this experiment. These concepts included the RTCA ACM definitions of distinct conflict detection and collision avoidance zones, and the use of a graded system of conflict alerts for the flight crew. Three studies were conducted in the course of the experiment. The first study investigated the effect of hazard proximity upon pilot ability to meet constraints and solve conflict situations.

40|$|A {{conflict}} detection and resolution tool, Terminal-area Tactical Separation-Assured Flight Environment (T-TSAFE), {{is being developed}} to improve the timeliness and accuracy of alerts and reduce the false alert rate observed with the currently deployed technology. The legacy system in use today, Conflict Alert, relies primarily on a dead reckoning algorithm, whereas T-TSAFE uses intent information to augment dead reckoning. In previous experiments, T-TSAFE was found to reduce the rate of false alerts and increase time between the alert to the controller and <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> over the legacy system. In the present study, T-TSAFE was tested under two meteorological conditions, 1) all aircraft operated under instrument flight regimen, and 2) some aircraft operated under mixed operating conditions.

The performance of T-TSAFE on final approach was compared with Automated Terminal Proximity Alert (ATPA), a tool recently deployed by the FAA. Results show that controllers did not report differences in workload or situational awareness between the T-TSAFE and ATPA cones but did prefer T-TSAFE features over ATPA functionality.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this paper explores the addition of conformally integrated traffic probes into an egocentric Synthetic Vision (SV) Primary Flight Display (PFD). The underlying thought is that, although the traffic that is predicted to cause a future loss of separation may not lie {{within the field of}} view of the display, the location where the loss of separation is predicted to occur always will. Hence, rather than focusing on the depiction of traffic, which contributes to level 2 Situation Awareness (SA), the concept pursues spatially integrated depiction of the airspace where <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> is predicted. This provides readily actionable conflict information, relieving pilots from the traffic position and conflict estimation task and contributing to level 3 SA. The paper describes the integration of the data from the traffic probe into an SV PFD. The advantages of the concept will be illustrated using several traffic conflict scenarios, including an overtaking scenario involving unmanned aircraft. Given that unmanned aircraft may be markedly slower than manned aircraft which operate within the same airspace, a spatially integrated depiction of airspace where a future loss of separation is predicted, can help to preserve safety in classes of airspace that accommodate both manned and unmanned aircraft. Additionally, examples are provided illustrating how traffic probes can support pilots in monitoring the conformance of traffic to the priority rules of 14 CFR 91. 113.

40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) is an electrodriven separation {{technique that}} is often used for the separation of chiral molecules. Advantages of CE are its flexibility, low cost and efficiency. On the other hand, the precision and transfer of CE methods are well-known problems of the technique. Reasons for the more complicated method transfer are the more diverse instrumental differences, such as total capillary lengths and capillary cooling systems; and the higher response variability of CE methods compared to other techniques, such as liquid chromatography (HPLC). Therefore, a larger systematic change in peak resolutions, migration times and peak areas, with <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> and efficiency may be seen when a CE method is transferred to another laboratory or another type of instrument. A swift and successful method transfer is required because development and routine use of analytical methods are usually not performed in the same laboratory and/or on {{the same type of}} equipment. The aim of our study was to develop transfer rules to facilitate CE method transfers between different laboratories and instruments. In our case study, three β-blockers were chirally separated and inter-instrumental transfers were performed. The first step of our study was to optimise the precision of the chiral CE method. Next, a robustness test was performed to identify the instrumental and experimental parameters that were most influencing the considered responses. The precision- and the robustness study results were used to adapt instrumental and/or method settings to improve the transfer between different instruments. Finally, the comparison of adapted and non-adapted transfers allowed deriving some rules to facilitate CE method transfers. © 2014 Elsevier B. V. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{majority}} of aircraft {{are now using}} Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for navigation. This {{has led to an}} effect of reducing the magnitude of lateral deviations from the route center line and, consequently, increasing the probability of a collision, should <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> vertical <b>separation</b> between aircraft on the same route occur. The International Civil Aviation Organiza- tion (ICAO) has introduced Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP) that allow suitably equipped aircrafts to fly with 1 nmi or 2 nmi lateral offset to the right of airway centerline in oceanic airspace. Very few aircraft, how- ever, are using the SLOP procedure {{because of the lack of}} understanding of its safety benefits and implementation issues in identifying correct lateral offset that can reduce the collision risk. This paper proposes an Evolution- ary Computation framework using Differential Evolution process to identify optimal lateral offsets for each airway in a given airspace such that it reduces the overall collision risk. Airway specific lateral offsets are then correlated with airway-traffic features using Multiple Regression models to identify which features can explain the optimal lateral offset. The proposed approach establishes a generic mapping that can suggest optimal lateral offsets for a given airspace based on airway-traffic features to mitigate colli- sion risk. The proposed methodology is applied to Collision Risk assessment of one-day traffic data (710 flights) in Bahrain Upper Airspace (FL 290 -FL 410) o estimate optimal lateral offset that resulted in significant reduction of collision risk. Further, the number of flights and crossings on an airway were identified as key features affecting optimal lateral offset...|$|R

A conflict is an event in which two or more aircraft experience <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> minimum allowable <b>separation.</b> Interest has grown in developing more advanced automation tools to predict when a traffic conflict is going to occur and to assist in its resolution.

40|$|Transatlantic flight {{operations}} are, {{due to the}} absence of radar-based surveillance, the influence of the polar jet stream and the highly directional traffic peaks, significantly different compared to continental {{flight operations}}. To safely accommodate all transatlantic traffic in the North Atlantic oceanic airspace the Organized Track System (OTS) has been established, existing of a number of pre-determined flight routes. Currently, about half of all transatlantic traffic uses the OTS which is created twice a day, once to accommodate the westbound traffic and once to accommodate the eastbound traffic flow. All aircraft requesting to use the OTS send an oceanic clearance request to the oceanic planning controller, containing the estimated time of arrival at the track entry boundary, the preferred OTS track, flight level and Mach number. The aircraft are cleared onto the OTS using a first-come, first-served (FCFS) approach, taking the separation requirements with already cleared aircraft into account. If an oceanic clearance request cannot be granted due to <b>a</b> potential <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation,</b> the requesting aircraft will receive an alternative clearance. The research objectives of this thesis assignment are to: “Reduce the total direct operating cost of transatlantic air traffic by optimizing the OTS track allocation procedure using a real-time meta-heuristic scheduling algorithm” “Create a model capable of optimizing the OTS track allocation procedure for different cost-index values” This research aims at improving the current OTS track allocation procedure by changing the first-come, first-served approach, currently used, to a scheduling concept in which the total direct operating cost (DOC) is minimized for a large number of aircraft in a single optimization window. The use of a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm is proposed in this thesis project and the potential of using stochastic optimization for large scheduling problems is researched. The direct operating cost penalties for the possible alternative clearances is determined using fuel consumption models in combination with time cost models. The created population algorithm is tested for multiple cost-index values, using real life problems, and the results are compared to the existing OTS track allocation procedure. The generated results show a potential direct operating cost reduction as well as the possibility to use the created track allocation algorithm as a real-time decision support tool for the oceanic planning controller.

40|$|As new {{operational}} paradigms {{and additional}} aircraft are being {{introduced into the}} National Airspace System (NAS), maintaining safety in such a rapidly growing environment becomes more challenging. It is therefore desirable to have an automated framework to {{provide an overview of}} the current safety of the airspace at different levels of granularity, as well an understanding of how the state of the safety will evolve into the future given the anticipated flight plans, weather forecast, predicted health of assets in the airspace, and so on. Towards this end, as part of our earlier work, we formulated the Real-Time Safety Monitoring (RTSM) framework for monitoring and predicting the state of safety and to predict unsafe events. In our previous work, the RTSM framework was demonstrated in simulation on three different constructed scenarios. In this paper, we further develop the framework and demonstrate it on real flight data from multiple data sources. Specifically, the flight data is obtained through the Shadow Mode Assessment using Realistic Technologies for the National Airspace System (SMART-NAS) Testbed that serves as a central point of collection, integration, and access of information from these different data sources. By testing and evaluating using real-world scenarios, we may accelerate the acceptance of the RTSM framework towards deployment. In this paper we demonstrate the framework's capability to not only estimate the state of safety in the NAS, but predict the time and location of unsafe events such as <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> between two aircraft, or an aircraft encountering convective weather.

40|$|In earlier {{research}} projects, {{the depiction of}} airspace in which <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> is predicted to occur has been explored {{as a means to}} increase conflict awareness. The computation of the conflict space is based on the current state of traffic and ownship. If the traffic maneuvers, the location and extent of the conflict space will change accordingly. Hence, if the other traffic also maneuvers to avoid the predicted loss of separation it is of fundamental importance that the maneuvers of ownship and traffic are complementary. To ensure that a conflict will indeed be avoided by such a maneuver and not accidentally made worse when both maneuver simultaneously, a form of coordination is necessary between the aircraft involved. Some research has been done in the area of implicit coordination between two aircraft, which provides coordinated resolution maneuvers to conflicting aircraft based on an epsilon criterion when only state information is periodically broadcast by the aircraft. This thesis explores conflict scenarios that need additional rules to be safely resolved using implicit maneuver coordination and provides possible solutions. Furthermore, a system is developed for the application of implicit maneuver coordination in scenarios that involve multiple intruders. This system is summarized in a decision tree {{that can be used to}} categorize scenarios according to the location of the closest point of approach of the intruders and the connectedness of the corresponding conflict areas. These factors determine the scenario complexity and the available or preferred conflict resolution options. The system can be used to support pilots in quickly assessing the most optimal maneuver in complex conflict scenarios, plan aircraft routes, or make preventive maneuvers. Maximum airspace density with implicit maneuver coordination is addressed based on the minimum distance to conflict at which a maneuver must be made to prevent loss of separation.

Although removal of CO 2 from natural gas using membranes is well established in industry, there is limited research on H 2 S removal, mainly due to its toxic nature. In actual field operations, wellhead pressures can exceed 50 bar with H 2 S concentrations up to 20 %. Membrane plasticization and competitive mixed-gas sorption, which can both lead to <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> efficiency, are likely to occur under these aggressive feed conditions, and this is almost always accompanied by {{a significant decrease in}} membrane selectivity. In this paper, permeation and separation properties of a hydroxyl-functionalized polymer with intrinsic microporosity (PIM- 6 FDA-OH) are reported for mixed-gas feeds containing CO 2, H 2 S or the combined pair with CH 4. The pure-gas permeation results show no H 2 S-induced plasticization of the PIM- 6 FDA-OH film in a pure H 2 S feed at 35 °C up to 4. 5 bar, and revealed only a slight plasticization up to 8 bar of pure H 2 S. The hydroxyl-functionalized PIM membrane exhibited a significant pure-gas CO 2 plasticization resistance up to 28 bar feed pressure. Mixed-gas (15 % H 2 S/ 15 % CO 2 / 70 % CH 4) permeation results showed that the hydroxyl-functionalized PIM membrane maintained excellent separation performance even under exceedingly challenging feed conditions. The CO 2 and H 2 S permeability isotherms indicated minimal CO 2 -induced plasticization; however, H 2 S-induced plasticization effects were evident at the highest mixed gas feed pressure of 48 bar. Under this extremely aggressive mixed gas feed, the binary CO 2 /CH 4 and H 2 S/CH 4 permselectivities, and the combined CO 2 and H 2 S acid gas selectivity were 25, 30 and 55, respectively. Our results indicate that OH-functionalized PIM materials are very promising candidate membrane materials for simultaneous removal of CO 2 and H 2 S from aggressive natural gas feeds, which makes membrane-based gas separation technology an attractive option for clean energy production and reducing greenhouse gas emissions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{electromagnetic}} design of a synchronous machine suited for a belt-driven alternator and starter (BAS) in a micro hybridisation of a mid-size passenger car. The BAS needs to provide a high cranking torque to start the combustion engine, especially in a cool condition where the requirements are highest.

This thesis compares four potential excitations of a synchronous machine: the permanently magnetised (PMSM), the electrically magnetised (EMSM), the EMSM with series magnetisation (SMSM), and the hybrid magnetised (HMSM).

40|$|The {{effects of}} descent {{trajectory}} prediction errors {{on the performance}} of an “Arrival Manager” algorithm are explored. Errors in descent calibrated airspeed and wind speed are modeled in order to assess their impact on the baseline performance of the Arrival Manager algorithm in terms of arrival time performance, airborne delay and the number <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation.</b> These data were obtained by simulating in fast-time two streams of arrival traffic merging at the northeast metering fix at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. A simple arrival schedule is imposed with uniform spacing between aircraft. Given the modeled error in descent speed or wind, the Arrival Manager’s ability to deliver each aircraft to meet its crossing-time constraint with no <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> from other aircraft is assessed. Results indicate that both metrics—airborne scheduled delay and the number <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> losses—are more sensitive to the modeled descent speed errors than the modeled wind speed error.

40|$|Various {{methods have}} been {{introduced}} {{in the past in}} efforts to optimize airspace sector design and the allocation of air traffic controllers. This is done with the aim to accommodate growth, increase productivity and most importantly to ensure safety of air traffic. To accomplish this, a more comprehensive understanding of human workload, especially that of the controllers involved, is required. In Air Traffic Control (ATC), there exists a maximum number of aircraft per sector that the Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) is assumed to be capable of controlling simultaneously. The maximum controllable traffic is gathered based on experimentation and subjective assessments of controller workload, which are sector specific. This threshold is not to be exceeded in order to maintain a reasonable and sustainable level of workload. However, a sector complexity metric based on the maximum number of aircraft does not consider the dynamic nature of air traffic, thus limiting the possibility of accommodating the growth of air traffic. Consequently, to better support strategic decisions that need information on ATC workload, we need better measures than just the number of aircraft. Metrics, for example the Dynamic Density (DD) that use a weighted combination of static and dynamic airspace properties, such as the number of aircraft flying through a sector, the ratio of climbing, cruising and descending aircraft, the horizontal proximity between aircraft et cetera, have been constructed and proposed as a sector complexity measure. The proposed weightings are determined through regression analysis on expert judgement for a particular sector design. As a result, these metrics become highly dependent on sector and operator-centered factors and therefore not uniformly applicable to a wider range of operators and sector designs. A careful calibration would then be needed to tailor the measure to each individual operator and also to the considered sector. In an effort to find a more objective measure of sector complexity and a predictor of workload, this thesis investigates a constraint-based measure based on the Solution Space Diagram (SSD). In essence, the SSD is a method to observe aircraft restrictions and opportunities to resolve air traffic conflicts in both the speed and heading dimensions. The SSD can be described as the available control area for the controlled aircraft in respect to other observed aircraft within the vicinity. The construction of the SSD is based on the projection of the ‘zone of conflict’ of the observed aircraft where the key constraint is the 5 NM separation minimum between aircraft. When considering the SSD for any individual aircraft, all neighboring aircraft introduce a ‘no-go area’ or ‘zone of conflict’ on the SSD. Intrusion of this zone is called <b>a</b> conflict, or, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation.</b> Looking at the results of the numerous off-line and real-time human-in-the-loop experiments, the proposed SSD metric shows a promising prospect of being an objective measure of sector complexity and a viable subjective workload predictor. However, these results are based on specific experiment settings, assumptions, and simplifications that were made throughout the research. Thus, to prove that the method was found to be the most suited metric in measuring sector complexity, a more extensive research regarding its performance and robustness should be done in the future. More comprehensive research on sector complexity has to be done {{in order to have a}} better understanding of sector complexity and controller workload. Also, to keep up with the relevance of the current situation, the extension of the SSD to the third dimension is crucial. Control and SimulationAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|With {{the growth}} of the air traffic {{movements}} and the population of people living around airports, the number of awakenings due to aircraft noise has increased. ICAO has defined four research fields to reduce noise {{and one of them is}} implementation of noise abatement operational procedures. This includes different trajectory optimization methods, one of which is rerouting of trajectories around noise sensitive areas. Research has proven that rerouting has a positive effect on reducing the number of people getting disturbed while keeping the fuel consumption as low as possible. Until now these trajectory optimization problems focused on either a departure or an arrival trajectory. When implementing these optimized routes, it may result in a conflict with other existing routes and this is the problem that is the main focus of this research. Within this research trajectories will be combined and optimized for number of awakenings and fuel consumption while assessing the effect of terminal operations. The model that combines trajectories is based on existing models, including a point-mass model and a noise model. These are combined in a multi-objective evolutionary algorithmwhere the objectives are the number of awakenings and the fuel consumption. The results of the optimization problems are presented as Paretooptimal solutions. To contribute to the field of noise abatement terminal operations, two trajectories are combined in an optimization problem. To assure enough distance between the two trajectories the minimum separation constraint is used. When <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> happens, the flight path angle of one of the trajectories is adjusted. The designed model is used to optimize four trajectory optimization problems. The first being a departure trajectory, this is the current Spijkerboor standard instrumental departure that departs from runway 24 at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The second problem is the current night standard terminal arrival route starting at sea and landing on runway 18 R at Schiphol. For the third optimization problem the two trajectories of the previous optimization problems are combined with keeping the minimumseparation constraint in mind. The final case study was used to focus more on the effect of the minimum separation constraint. From the departure optimization problem can be concluded that there is a big diversity in the vertical and horizontal trajectory between the minimum fuel andminimumawakening solution. For the arrival optimization problem the difference between these two solutions is not significant. The vertical trajectory is for both solutions almost the same, the main difference is caused by the ground trajectory. When combining the trajectories the results of the objective functions for the combined problemare the sum of the arrival and departure objective functions. This results in a bias to the departure trajectory because these numbers are atleast twice the value compared to the arrival trajectory. This also results in the arrival trajectory always being created around the departure trajectory. From the final case study can be concluded that when designing the trajectories the influence of the minimum separation constraint is mostly on the vertical profile of the departure trajectory. Also can be observed that small rerouting of the trajectories sometimes is needed to give both trajectories enough space to cross each other.

40|$|Our {{previous}} work presented an approach for developing high confidence algorithms for recovering aircraft from <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> situations. The correctness theorems for the algorithms relied on several key assumptions, namely that state data for all local aircraft is perfectly known, that resolution maneuvers {{can be achieved}} instantaneously, and that all aircraft compute resolutions using exactly the same data. Experiments showed that these assumptions were adequate {{in cases where the}} aircraft are far away from losing separation, but are insufficient when the aircraft have already lost separation. This paper describes the results of this experimentation and proposes a new criteria specification for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> recovery that preserves the formal safety properties of the previous criteria while overcoming some key limitations.

40|$|The {{demand for}} air travel {{worldwide}} {{continues to grow}} at a rapid rate, especially in Europe and the United States. In Europe, the demand exceeded predictions with a real annual growth of 7. 1 % in the period 1985 - 1990, against a prediction of 2. 4 %. By the year 2010, the demand is expected to double from the 1990 level. Within the UK international scheduled passenger traffic is predicted to increase, on average, by 5. 8 per cent per year between 1999 and 2003. The demand has not been matched by availability of capacity. In Western Europe many of the largest airports suffer from runway capacity constraints. Europe also suffers from an en-route airspace capacity constraint, which {{is determined by the}} workload of the air traffic controllers, i. e. the physical and mental work that controllers must undertake to safely conduct air traffic under their jurisdiction through en-route airspace. The annual cost to Europe due to air traffic inefficiency and congestion in en-route airspace is estimated to be 5 billion US Dollars, primarily due to delays caused by non-optimal route structures and reduced productivity of controllers due to equipment inefficiencies. Therefore, to in order to decrease the total delay, an increase in en-route capacity is of paramount importance. At a global scale and in the early 1980 s, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) recognised that the traditional air traffic control (ATC) systems would not cope with the growth in demand for capacity. Consequently new technologies and procedures have been proposed to enable ATC to cope with this demand, e. g. satellite-based system concept to meet the future civil aviation requirements for communication, navigation and surveillance/ air traffic management (CNS/ATM). In Europe, the organisation EUROCONTROL (established in 1960 to co-ordinate European ATM) proposed a variety of measures to increase the capacity of en-route airspace. A key change envisaged is the increasing delegation of responsibilities for control to flight crew, by the use <b>of</b> airborne <b>separation</b> assurance between aircraft, leading eventually to ?free flight? airspace. However, there are major concerns regarding the safety of operations in ?free flight? airspace. The safety of such airspace can be investigated by analysing the factors that affect conflict occurrence, i. e. <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the prescribed <b>separation</b> between two aircraft in airspace. This paper analyses the factors affecting conflict occurrence in current airspace and future free flight airspace by using a simulation model of air traffic controller workload, the RAMS model. The paper begins with a literature review of the factors that affect conflict occurrence. This is followed by a description of the RAMS model and of its use in this analysis. The airspace simulated is the Mediterranean Free Flight region, and the major attributes of this region and of the traffic demand patterns are outlined next. In particular a day?s air traffic is simulated in the two airspace scenarios, and rules for conflict detection and resolution are carefully defined. The following section outlines the framework for analysing the output from the simulations, using negative binomial (NB) and generalised negative binomial (GNB) regression, and discusses the estimation methods required. The next section presents the results of the regression analysis, taking into account the spatio-temporal nature of the data. The following section presents an analysis of the spatial and temporal pattern of conflicts in the two airspace scenarios across a day, highlighting possible metrics to indicate this. The paper concludes with future research directions based upon this analysis. ...|$|R
