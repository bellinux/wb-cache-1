5|$|Just {{before the}} Second World War, Lympne was requisitioned by the Fleet Air Arm. It was named HMS Buzzard and n renamed HMS Daedalus II three months later, before being {{transferred}} to the Royal Air Force in May 1940. During the war Lympne was a front-line fighter base, RAF Lympne. It was heavily bombed during the Battle of Britain in 1940 <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> of action {{for a number of}} weeks. It was too close to the coast {{to be used as a}} squadron base, but squadrons were detached there on a day-to-day basis. Lympne was also to have been the landing place for a German aircraft used in a plot to kidnap Adolf Hitler, with preparations made by the Royal Air Force for his arrival.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April German troops {{took over}} the Market Square, the Smolna, the Presidential Palace, and the Senate-Ritarihuone area. Toward the end, the Brigade Wolf with 2,000–3,000 {{soldiers}} joined the battle. The units rushed from north to the eastern parts of Helsinki, pushing into the working-class neighborhoods of Hermanni, Kallio and Sörnäinen. German artillery bombarded and destroyed the Workers' Hall, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the Red lantern of the Finnish revolution. The eastern parts of the town surrendered around 2 p.m., 13 April; a white flag {{was raised in the}} tower of the Kallio Church, but sporadic fighting lasted until the evening. In total, 60 Germans, 300–400 Reds and 23 White Guard troopers were killed in the battle. Around 7,000 Reds were captured. The German army celebrated the victory and demonstrated the might with a major military parade in the centre of Helsinki on 14 April 1918.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to Beryl produced heavy rainfall in Cuba, causing flooding, mudslides and two deaths. Torrential rain also affected south Florida and the Bahamas. After forming, Beryl produced rough surf along the US southeastern coast, leaving one person from Folly Beach, South Carolina missing. Upon making landfall in Florida, the storm produced strong winds that left 38,000people without power. High rains alleviated drought conditions <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> wildfires along the storm's path. A fallen tree {{killed a man}} driving in Orangeburg County, South Carolina. In northeast North Carolina, Beryl spawned an EF1 tornado that snapped trees and damaged dozens of homes {{near the city of}} Peletier. Overall damage was minor, estimated at $148,000.|$|E

5|$|All of the dreadnoughts {{except for}} Petropavlovsk were laid up in October–November 1918 {{for lack of}} manpower. She bombarded the rebellious {{garrison}} of Fort Krasnaya Gorka in 1919 and supported Bolshevik light forces operating against British ships supporting the White Russians in the Gulf of Finland. On 17 August 1919 Petropavlovsk was claimed as torpedoed <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> of action by the British Coastal Motor Boat CMB 88 in Kronstadt harbor, but was, in fact, not damaged at all. On 24 November 1919 a fire broke out in Poltavas forward boiler room and gutted much of her interior; she was never repaired although numerous proposals were made to reconstruct her. The crews of Sevastopol and Petropavlovsk joined the Kronstadt Rebellion of 1921 and they were renamed Parizhskaya Kommuna and Marat respectively after the rebellion was crushed to commemorate the Paris Commune and to erase their 'betrayal' of the Communist Party. The two undamaged ships were recommissioned in 1925–26 and all the ships were given proper revolutionary names.|$|E
5|$|The ship briefly {{operated}} between Glasgow {{and other}} ports in Scotland for Hutcheson's West Highland Service {{before she was}} purchased in September 1861 by James D. Bulloch, the primary foreign agent in Great Britain for the Confederacy, to deliver the military and naval ordnance and supplies that he had purchased. To disguise his control of Fingal, and the destination of her cargo, Bulloch hired an English crew and captain <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> his destination as Bermuda and Nassau in the Bahamas. The cargo was loaded in Greenock in early October, although Bullock and the other passengers would not attempt to board until they rendezvoused with the ship at Holyhead, Wales. On the night 14/15 October, as she was slowly rounding the breakwater at Holyhead, Fingal rammed and sank the Austrian brig Siccardi, slowly swinging at anchor without lights. Bulloch and the passengers embarked in the steamer while Bulloch dispatched {{a letter to his}} financial agents instructing them to settle damages with the brig's owners because he could not afford {{to take the time to}} deal with the affair lest he and Fingal be detained. The ship reached Bermuda on 2 November and, after leaving port on 7 November, Bulloch informed the crew that the steamer's real destination was Savannah, Georgia; he offered to take anyone who objected to the plan to Nassau. However, all of the crew agreed to join in the effort to run the Union blockade. Fingal was able slip safely into the Savannah estuary in a heavy fog on the night of 12 November without sighting any blockaders.|$|E

25|$|The two {{valuable}} timber trees, alpine ash E. delegatensis and Australian {{mountain ash}} E. regnans, {{are killed by}} fire and only regenerate from seed. The same 2003 bushfire that had little impact on forests around Canberra resulted in thousands of hectares of dead ash forests. However, {{a small amount of}} ash survived <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> new ash trees as well. There has been some debate as to whether to leave the stands or attempt to harvest the mostly undamaged timber, which is increasingly recognised as a damaging practice.|$|E

He confronts Shere Khan, who argues that Mowgli has made himself the enemy of the jungle by causing the wildfire. Mowgli throws the torch into the water, giving Shere Khan the advantage. Baloo, Bagheera, and the wolf pack intervene and hold Shere Khan off, giving Mowgli enough time to set a trap. He lures Shere Khan up a dead tree and onto a branch, which breaks under the tiger's weight and Shere Khan falls into the fire to his death. Mowgli then directs the elephants to divert the river <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the fire.|$|E
25|$|Philippide married twice. As a bachelor, {{he sought}} a German bride, having become {{convinced}} during his Halle days that a German woman {{would be ideal}} for him. His first wife, Johanna Minckwitz, had a doctorate in Romance philology and {{was the daughter of}} a Zürich professor. The marriage took place in a civil ceremony at Saint Helier on Jersey in early October 1895. Although initially delighted with his new wife, the relationship soured due to the presence of Philippide's mother-in-law in his house. During one heated argument, he handled an axe and Johanna took her mother's side. Eventually, the two women returned to Switzerland and the marriage ended in divorce. Johanna continued to be interested in Romanian literature, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> her own study of Eminescu's poetry. She and Philippide reportedly had a child, although details have not survived.|$|E

Orton's team won with Orton pinning Batista, winning the match for his team. His feud with Orton {{continued}} up to Armageddon where Batista defeated Orton. On December 15 episode of Raw, Batista was put into a handicap match against The Legacy with John Cena as his partner. During the match, Orton struck Batista with a punt to the head. Batista was knocked out <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> of action indefinitely due to a storyline head injury.

25|$|In parallel, {{he carried}} {{on with his}} {{literary}} activity, publishing {{a large number of}} books in quick succession and, in some cases, with significant success among the Romanian public. His first novel, titled Domnișoara din Str. Neptun ("Little Miss on Neptune Street"), saw print in 1921, and marked Aderca's definitive break with traditionalism. It was followed by a long line of other novels and novellas: Țapul ("The Goat", 1921), later reissued as Mireasa multiplă ("The Multiple Bride") and as Zeul iubirii ("The God of Love"); Moartea unei republici roșii ("The Death of a Red Republic", 1924); Omul descompus ("The Decomposed Man", 1926); Femeia cu carne albă ("The White-fleshed Woman", 1927). A member of the Romanian Writers' Society, Aderca also made his debut as a translator from French, publishing a version of Henri Barbusse's Hell (1921). In 1922, he reissued Naționalism? Libertatea de a ucide as Personalitatea. Drepturile ei în artă și în viață ("The Personality. Its Rights on Art and Life", dedicated to philosopher and Noua Revistă Română founder Constantin Rădulescu-Motru), <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the first section of a more theoretical writing, Idei și oameni ("Ideas and People").|$|E
25|$|In {{politics}} Thanet's profile was low, but {{he generally}} supported the Duke of Bedford {{and the opposition}} to Pitt. In May 1798 he was present with Fox, Sheridan, Erskine, and other whig sympathisers at the trial of Arthur O'Connor at Maidstone. O'Connor was found not guilty, but was not discharged, since a warrant for his arrest for another offence was pending. Thanet and others were charged with having created a riot in the court <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the lights {{in an attempt to}} rescue the prisoner, or at least to help his escape. The case was tried before Lord Kenyon at the king's bench on 25 April 1799. Sir John Scott prosecuted, and Erskine conducted the defence. Richard Brinsley Sheridan appeared to give evidence for the accused, and distinguished himself by parrying eight times, and finally evading, the question of Edward Law, counsel for the prosecution, ‘Do you believe Lord Thanet meant to favour the escape of O'Connor?’ Having been found guilty of riot and assault at Maidstone, Thanet was brought up for judgment on 3 May, and committed to the king's bench prison, the bail offered by the Duke of Bedford being refused. On 10 June he was sentenced to a year's imprisonment in the Tower of London and a fine of £1,000, and on his release he was ordered to give security for his good behaviour for seven years to the amount of £20,000.|$|E
