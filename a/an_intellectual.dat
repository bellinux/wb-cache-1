5|$|According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, {{the lack}} of {{explicit}} violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they {{play a central role}} in imagining. Nonetheless—citing its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemonium—Stommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather than <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> level.|$|E

5|$|N. R. Malkani finds Aurobindo's {{theory of}} {{creation}} to be false, as the theory talks about experiences and visions which are beyond normal human experiences.

Malkani says that awareness is already a reality and suggests {{there would be no}} need to examine the creative activity subjected to awareness.|$|E

5|$|Sunday never {{attended}} seminary {{and made}} no pretense of being a theologian or <b>an</b> <b>intellectual,</b> {{but he had a}} thorough knowledge of the Bible and was well read on religious and social issues of his day. His surviving Winona Lake library of six hundred books gives evidence of heavy use, including underscoring and reader's notes in his characteristic all-caps printing.

5|$|The Sea Wolf, {{released}} in 1941, {{was based on}} Jack London's novel. Although the film had a strong cast and production, Rossen's re-draft of the script may be the greatest influence on the film. While the character of Captain Larsen remained both victim and oppressed in a capitalist hierarchy, he {{became a symbol of}} fascism. He split the novel's idealist hero into <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> bosun and a rebellious seaman. Warner Bros. cut many political points during production.|$|E

5|$|Elu Suttina Kote (1987 Kannada film {{starring}} Ambareesh, Ramesh Aravind and Gautami Tadimalla), an Indian Kannada-language film {{which is}} primarily {{based on the}} novel. Few differences can be noted such as the lead actor wants to surrender to police however is said persuaded by his lover {{not to do so}} as there is no evidence. In the climax, the lead actor goes running himself to the police when he sees him on the way promising her that he will return with a clear conscience. Although this was <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> film with good expectations, it did not see huge commercial success as other films where Ambareesh was the lead actor.|$|E
5|$|Hawks' friend Howard Hughes finally {{suggested}} Cary Grant for the role. Grant {{had just}} finished shooting his breakthrough romantic comedy The Awful Truth, and Hawks may have seen a rough cut of the unreleased film. Grant then had a non-exclusive, four-picture deal with RKO for $50,000 per film, and Grant's manager used his casting in the film to renegotiate his contract, earning him $75,000 plus the bonuses Hepburn was receiving. Grant was initially concerned {{about being able to}} play <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> character and took two weeks to accept the role, despite the new contract. Hawks built Grant's confidence by promising to coach him throughout the film, instructing him to watch Harold Lloyd films for inspiration. Grant met with Howard Hughes throughout the film to discuss his character, which he said helped his performance.|$|E
