A simple model for scintillations events has been used to simulate current spiking during RVT and optimize test conditions.

40|$|Superhydrophobicity as a {{phenomenon}} {{has become an}} increasing focus of research and technological activity, where its fundamental aspects span surface chemistry, chemical physics, and cellular biology. Additionally, its significance to the behavior of natural systems, interfacial fluid dynamics, and biotechnology represents an area rapidly gaining potential importance. Detailed reviews have progressively explored superhydrophobicity {{from a number of}} viewpoints (e. g., Ma and Hill, 2006; Qu&# 0233;r&# 0233;, 2002; Shirtcliffe et al., 2010). Here, aspects underlying this wetting behavior are illustrated. It has long been recognized that surface roughness has a profound effect on wetting behavior, in particular through apparent contact angles and subsequent contact angle hysteresis (Bico et al., 2001; Qu&# 0233;r&# 0233;, 2008). Qu&# 0233;r&# 0233; (2008) points out that both chemical and structural surface heterogeneity can cause pinning of the three-phase contact line (TPL) of an <b>advancing</b> <b>wetting</b> front, whereby the difference in the advancing and receding contact angles produces a Laplace pressure and hence a force resisting further liquid advancement. Movement of the <b>wetting</b> front (<b>advancing</b> and receding) {{can be viewed as a}} kinetic process in response to changing forces at the TPL that characteristically produce jumps in the movement of this line. Rough and microstructured surfaces inherently increase hydrophobicity of hydrophobic surfaces through two very different mechanisms: a purely geometrical increase in the actual surface area with respect to its projected area generally termed the Wenzel state (Wenzel, 1936) and a composite interfacial effect arising from an air&# 8211;water interface when air is trapped between microstructural features of the surface ahead of the <b>advancing</b> <b>wetting</b> front forming a Cassie&# 8211;Baxter state (Cassie and Baxter, 1944), as illustrated in Figure 1.

The resulting electrostatic <b>wetting</b> <b>tension</b> acts in conjunction with the air-water surface tension (analogous to electrowetting scenarios), thereby affecting the nanobubble morphologies.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) fibers {{are interesting}} alternatives to carbon fibers as fibrous reinforcement. However, good interfacial adhesion between the fibers and the matrix {{is difficult to}} control. Wetting of the fiber reinforcement with the matrix strongly determines the interfacial strength.

In this work, dynamic contact angle measurements were conducted on individual CNT fibers by using a modified tensiometric method based on the Wilhelmy method combined with a synchronized optical observation. The CNT fiber-liquid interactions were monitored in-situ, and accurate measurements of the contact angles were achieved. Contact angles on CNTs were estimated through a modified Cassie-Baxter model on the basis of the experimental contact angle values of CNT fibers.

Both qualitative and quantitative information obtained from these analyses revealed a loss of flu-orine with minor surface oxidation. This was found to be limited to several monolayers near the surface of the ozone-treated polyvinyldiene fluoride pipe.

40|$|The {{adhesion}} between polymers {{and concrete}} {{is complex and}} needs to be studied with adequate methods. One problem is about the best test to determine adhesion strength. The use of traditional tests like direct tension, flexure or shear, normally does not enable the correct determination of the adhesion strength. If the adhesive is good and the substrate’s surfaces are well prepared, the failure is in the substrate. With this kind of faitures it is possible to say that adhesion strength is higher than the failure stress. It is not possible to give a numerical value of adhesion strength. A test based on fracture mechanics makes the determination of adhesion strength easier. The use of a notched specimen concentrates the stresses in the poliymer/substrate joint and adhesive failures are more frequent. With adhesive failures, it is possibie to determine the numerical value of the adhesion strength. The results’ analysis of adhesion tests needs to be made using appropriate methods. The presentation of the results is made in accordance with a square optimisation method where the adhesion in tension and the failure mode are taken into consideration.

Les essais réalisés montrent que seuls les tambours en dérivé fluorocarboné de très faible tension critique de mouillage s'avèrent intéressants pour des utilisations industrielles. En effet, ils présentent un comportement indépendant de l'histoire de leur exposition ce qui les rend très faciles à utiliser, sans précautions particulières, du fait de leur très grande sélectivité vis-à-vis des hydrocarbures. Par contre, les autres tambours, qui présentent des contributions polaires non négligeables à leur énergie de surface, ont des comportements vis-à-vis des hydrocarbures fonction de l'histoire de leur exposition et ne s'avèrent pas sélectifs vis-à-vis des hydrocarbures à récupérer. The {{aim of this}} article is to analyze the influence of the surface energy of a deoiling drum on its gathering efficiency and selectivity. The project consists in testing drums having the same size but made of materials having different surface energies so as to evaluate the influence of this key parameter that had previously been poorly analyzed. Four materials were chosen : stainless steel, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, and a fluorocarbon derivative. These materials are representative, a priori, of the behavior of most materials because of the position of their critical <b>wetting</b> <b>tension</b> (gamma c) compared to the superficial tension values of water (72 dyn/cm) and the hydrocarbon phases to be gathered (25 to 35 dyn/cm) (Fig. 1). It should be noted that the fluorocarbon derivative drum tested was patented by our laboratory and is currently marketed by Société Elf. To simulate industrial conditions of the use of deoiling drums, we chose a tangential rotation speed of 0. 24 m/s, appreciably corresponding to the rotation speed of Elf drums. Likewise, the pollution sequences performed in the laboratory were examined to simulate the different working conditions of an industrial drum. Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8 show the volumes of kerosine and water gathered for each of the four drums as a function of time, together with the cumulative volumes of kerosine added to the test tank (Fig. 2) to simulate sequential pollution. The experimental results obtained reveal the different types of behavior by deoiling drums according to the nature of the material making them up : 1) If all the drums tested were first immersed in and imbibed by the kerosine phase before being immersed in water, they were able to recover the polluting kerosine phase under excellent conditions. No appreciable difference in behavior was found among the different materials (Fig. 17). 2) At the end of the recovery of the initial pollution, with the drums rotating in water, three different types of behavior could be seen as a function of time. The steel drum immediately forms a very large film of water over its entire surface area (Fig. 5). The PVC and polypropylene drums are not immediately covered by water after the disappearance of the kerosine film. However, after several hours, a slight rise in the water film can be seen in preferential areas of the drums. This dynamic phenomenon increased in time, and after 24 hours of operating the entire surface area of the drums was covered by a homogeneous water film (Figs. 6 c and 7 c). Only the fluorocarbon-derivative drum, after having entirely recovered the hydrocarbon phase, was not covered by water after 24 hours. It thus proves to be very advantageous from the industrial standpoint since it is highly selective with regard to hydrocarbons. 3) After this conditioning phase in water during 24 hours, recovery of the second pollution phase led to two very different behaviors between the steel drum and the three plastic drums. The stainless-steel drum continued, despite the presence of a layer of 3 cm of kerosine on the surface, to bring up the same amount of water. On the contrary, the three other drums immediately raised a very large film of kerosine. To conclude, these tests reveal three types of extreme behaviors that are representative, a priori, of the materials as a whole. Materials with high surface energy of the metal type cannot raise a hydrocarbon phase under good conditions unless they are previously wetted hence conditioned by this hydrocarbon phase. Such materials are thus of little interest for the continuous specific recovery of hydrocarbon phases. Materials with low surface energy such as plastics can be classified in two groups :- Standard plastics with a critical <b>wetting</b> <b>tension</b> of greater than 30 dyn/cm, and which often have appreciable polar contributions to the surface energy to be recovered without prior conditioning of the drum by a hydrocarbon phase. However, after prolonged contact with water, such drums take up large amount of water. In effect, they are suitable only for sequential operating under the control of an operator. - On the other hand, drums made of fluorocarbon derivatives with very low critical <b>wetting</b> <b>tension</b> proved to be highly selective with regard to hydrocarbons, and above all they do not take up water. Such drums marketed on a large scale by Société Elf thus lend themselves to continuous autonomous operations...|$|R

Surfactants alter interfacial tension and modify the invasion of pores by immiscible fluids. Experiments are conducted to explore the propagation of fluid interfaces along cylindrical capillary tubes and across pore constrictions {{in the presence of}} surfactants. Measured pressure signatures reflect the interaction between surface tension, contact angle, and the pore geometry. Various instabilities occur as the interface traverses the pore constriction, consequently, measured pressure signatures differ from theoretical trends predicted from geometry, lower capillary pressures are generated in <b>advancing</b> <b>wetting</b> fronts, and jumps are prone to under-sampling. Contact angle and instabilities are responsible for pronounced differences between pressure signatures recorded during advancing and receding tests. Pressure signatures gathered with surfactant solutions suggest changes in interfacial tension at the constriction; the transient surface tension is significantly lower than the value measured in quasi-static conditions. Interface stiffening is observed during receding fronts for solutions near the critical micelle concentration.

Case Description: A 90 -year-old woman presented with acute pain and reduction in vision in the left eye. Her intraocular pressure (IOP) was 55 mm Hg. There were red tinted blood cells in the anterior chamber giving it a reddish hue. The patient was known to have <b>advanced</b> <b>wet</b> macular degeneration. She was taking oral warfarin for atrial fibrillation. Her international normalised ratio (INR) was 7. 7. B-scan ultrasound of posterior segment showed vitreous and suprachoroidal haemorrhages. An ultrabiomicroscopic examination confirmed open angles. A diagnosis of haemolytic glaucoma secondary to intraocular haemorrhages was made. The IOP was controlled medically. Warfarin was withdrawn and oral vitamin K therapy was initiated leading to a rapid INR reduction. Three days later, her anterior chamber became progressively shallower causing a secondary acute angle closure which was managed medically. After 2 months, the left IOP was well-controlled without any medications and the eye was not inflamed. Her vision in that eye remained perception of light. Conclusion: Patients with suprachoroidal haemorrhages should be closely monitored as they might subsequently develop acute angle closure despite an initially open angle and well-controlled INR and IOP.

40|$|Advanced age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is the leading}} cause of late onset blindness. We present results of a genome-wide association study of 979 advanced AMD cases and 1, 709 controls using the Affymetrix 6. 0 platform with replication in seven additional cohorts (totaling 5, 789 unrelated cases and 4, 234 unrelated controls). We also present a comprehensive analysis of copy-number variations and polymorphisms for AMD. Our discovery data implicated the association between AMD and a variant in the hepatic lipase gene (LIPC) in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) pathway (discovery P = 4. 53 e- 05 for rs 493258). Our LIPC association was strongest for a functional promoter variant, rs 10468017, (P = 1. 34 e- 08), that influences LIPC expression and serum HDL levels with a protective effect of the minor T allele (HDL increasing) for <b>advanced</b> <b>wet</b> and dry AMD. The association we found with LIPC was corroborated by the Michigan/Penn/Mayo genome-wide association study; the locus near the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 was corroborated by our replication cohort for rs 9621532 with P = 3. 71 e- 09. We observed weaker associations with other HDL loci (ABCA 1, P = 9. 73 e- 04; cholesterylester transfer protein, P = 1. 41 e- 03; FADS 1 - 3, P = 2. 69 e- 02). Based on a lack of consistent association between HDL increasing alleles and AMD risk, the LIPC association may not be the result of an effect on HDL levels, but it could represent a pleiotropic effect of the same functional component. Results implicate different biologic pathways than previously reported and provide new avenues for prevention and treatment of AMD...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{contribute}} {{to the understanding of}} the experience of living with Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and its impact on quality of life through the use of a pragmatically guided mixed methods approach. AMD is a condition resulting in the loss of central vision in old age which can have a huge impact on the lives of patients. This thesis includes: literature reviewing; qualitative meta-synthesis; surveys and descriptive statistics; observation; and analysis of in-depth interviewing, in order to build a picture of what it is like for older people to live with AMD. I present the findings from six separate studies each designed to answer specific research questions. I begin with a mixed methods study to determine how well the most commonly used measure of quality of life for AMD patients’ represents patient experiences. I then go on to investigate the experiences of patients with AMD through a meta-synthesis of qualitative research and finally present four of my own empirical studies three of which investigate the experiences of patients with different types of AMD: early dry AMD, treatable <b>wet</b> AMD and <b>advanced</b> <b>wet</b> AMD and the final study investigates what it is like for a couple living together with AMD. Throughout the qualitative studies I use Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) to develop an understanding of the experiences and life contexts of patients with AMD. Through rigorous analysis, I identify a range of themes which highlight the shared and divergent experiences of individuals with AMD and the need to acknowledge patients’ past, present and potential future life contexts and experiences when providing services to older people with AMD. I relate the findings of the six studies to the wider psychological literature on chronic illness and make recommendations for services for patients with AMD to be provided holistically within a lifeworld-led health care model.

40|$|Water {{management}} practices in conserving water for arid lands are crucial in sustaining agriculture and food production. Sandy soils (Typic Torrripsamments] are practically important land resources in many Middle Eastern countries. In a laboratory experiment, five naturally occurring clay deposits were applied {{at different rates}} to sandy calcareous soil in order to evaluate their effect on relative swelling, infiltration and water conservation. Relative swelling index (RSI), cumulative infiltration (D), and <b>advance</b> of <b>wetting</b> front (Z) were measured in the laboratory for untreated and treated soil samples mixed with 1, 2, 3, and 5 % of the clay deposits. Results indicated that addition of natural deposits significantly increased RSI. The differences in RSI values between natural deposits at any rate of application were significant and related to clay content and presence of smectite type clay. RSI values for each clay deposit fitted to the following exponential function with the application rate x (RSI=aebx}. Results of D indicated that increasing natural deposit rate significantly increased the time required for the wetting front to reach 40 cm. There {{was a significant difference}} between the clay deposits at 5 % rate and the difference was related to the type of clay and clay content in each deposit. The presence of CaCO 3, dominance of kaolinite type clay and low clay content in the deposits enhanced water movement while dominance of smectite clay and high clay content decreased D. <b>Advance</b> of <b>wetting</b> front was markedly affected by the type and the rates of clay deposit applied. Z decreased with increasing rates of clay deposits. Soil water distribution profile was characterized by three zones based on the type and the rate of applied clay deposit to the soil...|$|R
40|$|Water-level {{increase}} after rainfall {{is usually}} indicative of rainfall recharge to groundwater. This, however, {{may not be}} true if the Lisse effect occurs. This effect represents the water-level increase in a well driven by airflow induced by an <b>advancing</b> <b>wetting</b> front during highly intensive rains. The rainwater, which may behave like a low-permeability lid, seals the ground surface so that the air pressure beneath the wetting front is increased because of air compression due to downward movement of the wetting front. A rapid and substantial rise of the water level in the well screened below water table, which bears no relationship to groundwater recharge, can be induced when various factors such as soil properties and the rain-runoff condition combine favorably. A transient, three-dimensional and variably saturated flow model was employed to study the air and groundwater flows in the soil under rain conditions. The objectives of this paper are two-fold: to evaluate the reliability of the theory of the Lisse effect presented by Weeks to predict its magnitude in modeled situations that mimic the physical complexity of real aquifers, and to conduct parametric studies on the sensitivity of the water-level rise in the well to soil properties and the rain event. The simulation results reveal that the magnitude of the Lisse effect increases with the ponding depth. Soil permeability {{plays a key role in}} generating the Lisse effect. The water-level rise in the well is delayed relative to the air-pressure rise in the unsaturated zone when the soil permeability is low, and the maximum water-level rise is less than the maximum air pressure induced by rain infiltration. The simulation also explores the sensitivity of the Lisse effect to the van Genuchten parameters and the water table depth.

40|$|Capillary {{phenomena}} in cohesionless soils {{play an important}} role in the migration of liquids through the unsaturated zone above and close to groundwater sources. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a theoretical and experimental study of capillary flow in the radial direction. A closed-form solution for the time-dependent <b>advance</b> of <b>wetting</b> front radius is derived as a function of porosity, degree of saturation, hydraulic conductivity, and capillary head. A laboratory test called the "radial horizontal capillarity test" was developed to measure the radial movement of the wetting front as a function of time and experiments were conducted. Values of capillary-induced hydraulic conductivity and capillary head from the theory and experiments on sands and silt are close to those obtained from linear horizontal capillarity tests...|$|R
