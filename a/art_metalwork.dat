50|$|In 1941 {{following}} the unexpected sudden death of George Atkinson, then Director of the National College of Art, Michael {{was appointed to}} the position of Acting Director. Shortly thereafter in 1942 Michael was appointed Director. It was because of this position that he changed his name to the Irish form (Micheál de Búrca) because the Director was required to be a Gaeilgeoir (an Irish language enthusiast). He was already fluent in Irish. He used the signature Michael Bourke initially, before switching to Micheál de Búrca. He continued to paint and exhibit as the Director. During World War II he re-introduced stained glass, screen printing, weaving and metal work to the college's curriculum. To facilitate this expansion he encouraged Patrick McElroy, a blacksmith and RAF veteran with CIÉ to lecture on enamelling and fine <b>art</b> <b>metalwork.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{place has}} a strong {{association}} with Governor Samuel Wensley Blackall and the prominence of the site selected for his huge monument indicates the prestige allotted to him and remains as a legacy of his influence and popularity. The Cemetery also has a special association with the life and work of its Trustees - those responsible for its development and maintenance, {{most of whom are}} interred within the grounds. As a foundation Trustee, architect James Cowlishaw's (1834-1929) association spanned 59 years. John Petrie (1822-1892), builder, monumental mason and Brisbane's first Lord Mayor was also a foundation Trustee and his monumental masonry business located opposite the main entry to the cemetery for 100 years produced {{a large proportion of the}} memorials and headstones in the cemetery. Architect Edward Myer Myers (1864-1926) was a Trustee from 1920 until his death and was responsible for the design of the Amenities Building.

Export markets readily accepted the style, which has continued to be produced ever since, both in China and around the world.|$|R
