Over the next few days the IPCC told reporters that Tomlinson's family were not surprised that he had had a heart attack. When journalists <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had been in contact with police officers before his death, they were told the speculation would upset the family.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Travers {{heard the}} gunmen rummaging {{in the back}} of the minibus, where he kept his guitar. Concerned it might be damaged, he {{approached}} the two gunmen and told them to be careful. <b>Asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had anything valuable inside the case, Travers replied no. The gunman turned him round, punched him in the back and pushed him on the shoulder back into the line-up.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Slaughter was the {{favorite}} choice {{for governor of}} Kentucky in 1812. Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into open war. With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as a possible candidate for governor. Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited him and <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would run. Shelby assured {{him that he had}} no desire to do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.|$|E

[...] "I {{have heard that}} Christianity keeps the key of virtue, and that if you read Tom Paine you will cut your throat at Monte Carlo. It is such rubbish that I am not even angry at it. You say that Christianity is the prop of morals; but what more do you do? When a doctor attends you and could poison you with a pinch of salt, do you <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> is a Christian? You <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> is a gentleman, <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> is an M.D.--anything but that. When a soldier enlists to die for his country or disgrace it, do you <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> is a Christian? You {{are more likely to}} <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> is Oxford or Cambridge at the boat race. If you think your creed {{essential}} to morals why do you not make it a test for these things?" ...|$|R

Gabe breaks down, and Andy promises he will not date Erin again. Gabe confronts Andy with the promise after he sees the two hanging out together, but Andy stands up for himself and embarrasses Gabe by describing Gabe's crying fit to Erin. When <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> wants to date Erin, he refuses to give a straight answer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} and summer of 1942, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin {{regularly}} toured villages in the Goražde, Kalinovik and Foča districts, encouraging the local civilians and Chetnik detachments to behave loyally towards the Italians. The Italians were unable to gain German support for their plan to use Chetnik groups as auxiliaries during the joint Italian-German anti-Partisan Operation Trio in April–May. In May, Jevđević met with German intelligence officers in Dubrovnik and was <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would cooperate in the pacification of Bosnia. Mihailović was aware of and condoned the collaborationist arrangements entered into by Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin. Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin frequently met with Chetnik commander Momčilo Đujić in Split, and the three men quarrelled over how to divide the financial assistance they were receiving from the Italians.|$|E

He was <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> attributed Johnson's technique to this pact, and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmation.|$|E
25|$|When <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> was a deva or a human, {{he replied}} that he had {{eliminated}} the deep-rooted unconscious traits {{that would make him}} either one, and should instead be called a Buddha; one who had grown up in the world but had now gone beyond it, as a lotus grows from the water but blossoms above it, unsoiled.|$|E
25|$|Two Border Patrol agents {{demanded to}} know where he was from. He {{answered}} their question accurately and produced a copy of a form showing his admission into the U.S. as a refugee. The agents <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had been fingerprinted and photographed through NSEERS ("Special Registration"). He answered, accurately, that he had not: refugees are exempt from that program. They arrested him.|$|E

25|$|Mayer {{eventually}} retired, {{and the new}} detective {{assigned to}} the case told Nels Rasmussen that {{he was unable to}} follow up on Mayer's notes and did not think that any new leads would emerge. Nels was rebuffed again in 1993, when he offered to pay for DNA testing on the evidence from the murder, now that the technology was available; he was told that the police had to have a suspect in order to proceed with testing. Lazarus briefly reunited with Ruetten in 1989; Mayer's notes show that Ruetten had called him and <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> still considered her a suspect.|$|E
25|$|When Qabbani was 15, his sister, who was 25 at the time, {{committed}} suicide because {{she refused to}} marry a man she did not love. During her funeral he decided to fight the social conditions he saw as causing her death. When <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> was a revolutionary, the poet answered: “Love in the Arab world is like a prisoner, and I want to set (it) free. I want to free the Arab soul, sense and body with my poetry. The relationships {{between men and women}} in our society are not healthy.” He is {{known as one of the}} most feminist and progressive intellectuals of his time.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary responsa {{deal with}} both {{traditional}} questions and phenomena associated with modern social, religious, medical and technological developments. For example, Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon noted that, while orbiting the earth, {{the space shuttle}} experiences a day/night cycle approximately every ninety minutes. Thus, Ramon <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> should keep the Sabbath according to Earth time, or mark it once every seven day/night cycles (ten and a half hours). And if according to Earth time, then what location on Earth should this be based upon? The rabbis concluded {{that he was to}} celebrate the Sabbath in accordance with Earth time, based on the place of his departure, Cape Canaveral.|$|E
25|$|All {{criminal}} trials {{before the}} High Court are heard and disposed of before a single Judge of the High Court. When the Court {{is ready to}} commence a trial, the accused appears or is brought before the court. The charge is read and explained, and the accused is <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> or she is guilty of the offence or claims to be tried. If the accused pleads guilty the plea is recorded, {{and he or she}} may be convicted on it and sentenced. If the accused refuses to or does not plead, or if he or she claims trial, the Court proceeds to try the case.|$|E
25|$|A mistake, however, {{prevented}} {{the move to}} the club: when the contract had been agreed, Dalglish realised {{they did not have}} the correct paperwork needed to complete the transfer. This was on a Friday afternoon, and the office had been locked up for the weekend. With a verbal agreement in place, they agreed to meet on Monday morning to complete the transfer officially. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, hearing about the move, phoned Keane and <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would like to join them instead of Blackburn. Ferguson ensured they had the paperwork ready and met up with Keane on the Saturday and signed for Manchester United for £3.75million, a British transfer record at the time.|$|E

25|$|Cram himself {{informed}} investigators of Gacy's {{attempts to}} rape him in 1976 {{and stated that}} after he and Gacy had returned to his home after the December 13 search of his property, Gacy had turned pale upon noting a clot of mud on his carpet which he suspected had come from his crawl space. Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> {{had been to the}} crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing. Cram stated these trenches were two feet (60cm) wide, six feet (200cm) long and two feet (60cm) deep—the size of graves.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, former Tel Kabri Expedition excavator, Assaf Yasur-Landau, and geophysicist, Yitzhach Makovsky, both then of Tel Aviv University, {{conducted}} an investigation {{to see if}} Kempinski and Niemeier had underestimated {{the size of the}} palace at Tel Kabri. They conducted electric resistivity and magnetometric soundings in an attempt to map out the architectural features under the soil without having to dig trenches. Their findings showed that the palace was indeed larger than previously thought. With these results, Yasur-Landau approached his former Megiddo Expedition colleague, Prof. Eric H. Cline of The George Washington University, the following year and <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would like to co-direct new excavations at Tel Kabri. After devoting a year to getting the necessary funding and permits for excavation, the two were able to begin work on the site in the summer of 2005.|$|E
25|$|In August 2017, he was <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> {{might have}} {{acquired}} Greek citizenship through his mother, born in Greece, and British or Cypriot nationality through his father, an ethnic Greek {{who was born}} in Cyprus when it was a British colony and who possessed a British passport. He stated: “I’ve never had, never sought, never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution I wrote to the Greek embassy and Cypriot high commission saying essentially, ‘I’ve never been a citizen, I don’t want to be, so if there’s any question that I could be, I renounce any rights to be’. I don’t know what else I can do in the circumstances.” He added that he had not received replies to these enquiries. Later he said he had renounced Greek citizenship but, on finding he might be British, he had sought clarification from British authorities. On 19 August, he announced that British authorities had confirmed he is a British Overseas citizen, a lesser form of British nationality. He stated that he would not resign from the Parliament, but would await a High Court decision. Together with that of Nash, Xenophon's case was referred to the Court on 4 September.|$|E
