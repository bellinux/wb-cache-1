Cr (III) concentrations were greatest during periods of high biological activity, as indicated by strong correlations between the ratio <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> (III) :Cr (VI) and both bacterial biomass and primary productivity.

Negligible effect of EDTA on the uptake <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> 6 + was found, but significant decrease <b>of</b> the <b>Cr</b> concentration in roots was measured. Although the translocation <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> 6 + within plant materials was detected in response to EDTA concentration, the amount <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> 6 + translocated to the lower stems was considerably small. EDTA in the nutrient media showed {{a negative effect on}} the uptake <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> 3 + by hybrid willows; the removal rates <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> 3 + were significantly decreased. Translocation <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> 3 + into the stems and leaves was undetectable, but roots were the exclusive sink for Cr 3 + accumulation. Weeping willows (Salix babylonica L.) showed lower removal rates for both chemical forms <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> than hybrid willows. Although EDTA had a minor effect on Cr 6 + uptake by weeping willows, positive effect on Cr 6 + translocation within plant materials was observed. It was also determined that EDTA in plant growth media significantly decreased the amount <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> 3 + taken up by plants, but significantly increased Cr 3 + mobilization from roots to stems. Results indicated that EDTA was unable to increase the uptake <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> 6 + by both plant species, but translocation <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> 6 +-EDTA within plant materials was possible. Addition of EDTA in the nutrient media showed a strong influence on the uptake and translocation <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> 3 + in both willows.

40|$|The cosmic ray(CR) positrons and antiprotons {{are often}} {{regarded}} as the products <b>of</b> collisions <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> nucleons with the interstellar medium. However this conclusion is challenged by recent experimental data. In this work, we choose the latest AMS- 02 data to analyze the astrophysical background <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> positrons and antiprotons based on the GALPROP code for CR propagation and QGSJET-II- 04 for hadronic CR interactions. The results show that in low energies the flux <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> antiprotons is consistent with AMS- 02 data, and the over-predicted flux <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> positrons is well reduced in a diffusion model combining the re-acceleration and convection terms. Using this model, the calculated flux <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> protons is consistent with AMS- 02 data with the hardening feature above 330 GeV. Based on this model, using the total fluxes <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> electrons and positrons from AMS- 02, interpretation of dark matter annihilation on the positron excess are also analyzed.

40|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> 1 on erythrocytes, as {{measured}} by monoclonal antibodies, remains undefined because of the repetitive structure <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> 1 {{and the presence of}} different types <b>of</b> structural <b>CR</b> 1 alleles. We studied the number <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> 1 per erythrocyte using two monoclonal antibodies, E 11 and 3 D 9, which recognize different sites on CR 1. The number of binding sites was higher for E 11 than for 3 D 9 (ratio E 11 / 3 D 9 : 1. 9 +/- 0. 4, n = 17); however, this ratio was not affected by CR 1 numbers or alleles. Partial digestion with papain <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> 1 on erythrocytes abolished the binding of 3 D 9. It reduced the binding of E 11 to one-third of its initial value (0. 35 +/- 0. 03; n = 13) using cells with different CR 1 numbers or alleles. By immunoblotting, a unique 75 -kDa stump <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> 1 remained attached to the erythrocytes for every allele studied. Taken together, these results suggest that the number <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> 1 has been over-estimated in the past using E 11 by a factor of 2, or more probably 3. However, the over-estimation <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> 1 number has been identical for erythrocytes bearing different CR 1 numbers or alleles...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{investigation}} of Lie algebras <b>of</b> local infinitesimal <b>CR</b> automorphisms. Such algebras are naturally associated to germs <b>of</b> homogeneous <b>CR</b> manifolds. The authors introduce a corresponding abstract notion <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> algebra. A CR algebra is a pair (L,L_ 1) (L,L 1), consisting of a real Lie algebra LL and a subalgebra L_ 1 L 1 of the complexification C⊗_ R LC⊗RL, such that the factor space L/L∩ L_ 1 L/L∩L 1 is finite-dimensional. The authors investigate some formal properties <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> algebras and construct some "fibrations" (i. e., LL-equivariant submersions) of such algebras. They introduce three new notions <b>of</b> nondegeneracy <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> algebras [...] -strict, weak and ideal nondegeneracy. These three concepts are weaker than those used previously by some other authors. The authors intend to extend the application of the É. Cartan method of investigating the equivalence <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> structures to some larger classes <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> manifolds. One <b>of</b> the main ideas of this paper is a decomposition <b>of</b> arbitrary <b>CR</b> algebras into three "parts": totally real, totally complex and weakly nondegenerate CR algebras (Theorems 5. 3 and 5. 4). There are some results about these three special classes <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> algebras. Some results about prolongations for transitive CR algebras are also obtained, in particular about maximality <b>of</b> parabolic <b>CR</b> algebras with respect to transitive prolongations...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{available}} nitrogen in nutrient solution on removal of two chemical forms <b>of</b> chromium (<b>Cr)</b> by plants was investigated. Pre-rooted hankow willows (Salix matsudana Koidz) were grown in a hydroponic solution system {{with or without}} nitrogen, and amended with hexavalent chromium [Cr (VI) ] or trivalent chromium [Cr (III) ] at 25. 0 ± 0. 5 °C for 192 h. The results revealed that higher removal <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> by plants was achieved from the hydroponic solutions without any nitrogen than those containing nitrogen. Although faster removal <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> (VI) than Cr (III) was observed, translocation <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> (III) within plant materials was more efficient than Cr (VI). Substantial difference existed in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> {{in different parts of}} plant tissues due to the nitrogen in nutrient solutions (p 0. 05). Removal rates <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> (III) decreased linearly with the strength of nutrient solutions with or without N addition (p< 0. 01). Translocation efficiencies <b>of</b> both <b>Cr</b> species increased proportionally with the strength of N-containing nutrient solutions and decreased with the strength of N-free nutrient solutions. Results suggest that uptake and translocation mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> (VI) and Cr (III) are apparently different in hankow willows. The presence of easily available nitrogen and other nutrient elements in the nutrient solutions had a more pronounced influence on the uptake <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> (III) than Cr (VI). Nitrogen availability and quantities in the ambient environment will affect the translocation <b>of</b> both <b>Cr</b> species and their distribution in willows in phytoremediation. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.
