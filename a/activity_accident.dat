40|$|Medicine—have {{turned their}} attention, {{with varying degrees}} of effectiveness, to the problem of dangerously poor quality {{medicines}} [1]. While substandard medi-cines are found everywhere in the world, it is the poorest countries with the weakest capacity for drug regulation and quality control that suffer the most. Everyone agrees that poor quality medicines are undesirable, but not every-one agrees on how to define them. It is clear that iatrogenic harm arises from at least two distinct, concurrent problems: (i) medicines that are accidentally or negli-gently ‘‘substandard’ ’ as a result of various failures in manufacturing, handling, regu-lation, or some combination of these, and (ii) medicines that are deliberately ‘‘falsi-fied,’’—neither being of the correct stan-dard nor being properly registered through a country’s regulatory authori-ty—and that call out for criminal law measures to suppress. In all cases, the result is a potentially dangerous medicine, whether occasioned by criminal <b>activity,</b> <b>accident,</b> or negligence [2]. A sound drug regulatory system is essential to overcome these problems. Yet while WHO estimates that nearly a third of its member states have very limited or no capacity for medicine regulation [3], it has yet to propose a concrete action plan to help ensure th...|$|E

Examples of types of software used by accident reconstructionists are CAD (computer aided design) programs, vehicle specification databases, momentum and energy analysis programs, collision simulators, and photogrammetry software.|$|R

40|$|Societal {{debates about}} the riskiness and {{acceptability}} of controversial technologies have led scientists to propose and apply quantitative definitions of risk. In parallel of this, psychological {{research has focused on}} identifying the factors underlying risk judgments and risky decisions. One such factor is the (subjective) probability of a future loss or accident. The present monograph reports on a series of studies about the cognitive mechanisms underlying accident probability assesment. For complex and realistic risky <b>activities,</b> <b>accident</b> probability judgments may be based on two fundamentally different types of information: frequency and scenario information. Frequency information refers to the outcomes of similar situations or activities in the past (''how often did accidents happen?''). Scenario information describes the way(s) in which a future accident may occur (''how might an accident happen?''). The aim of the present research was to study the role and relative importance of these types of information for risk judgment and risky decision making. [...] . Zie: Summary. ...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} face {{continuous}} pollution {{by means of}} run-offs, a new protection zone concept is currently being elaborated for the Upper-Sûre lake. To date, the protection zones that were defined by the national law of the 27 th of May 1961 are still in use [27] (Fig.  4). In the new scenario, these two existing protection zones will be extended by a third zone. The protection areas 2 and 3 not only {{take into account the}} surface of the watershed (42, 600  ha, amongst which 2 / 3 is situated on Belgian ground), but also consider the slope of the terrain. These protection zones will, in a first step, only be installed on Luxembourgish territories.

The objectives were to identify relationships between accidents and time exposure, workers’ age and sex, equipment used and work activities in family forestry's firewood production.

40|$|Drawing on the DFID’s {{sustainable}} livelihood framework, {{this paper}} explores the nexus between artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) and livelihood in Prestea mining region, Ghana. A cross-sectional mixed method survey involving simple random and purposively sampled participants () was carried out. The results suggest {{both positive and}} negative relationships between ASM and livelihoods of the people. The study found various livelihood assets associated with ASM and how critical assets are adversely affected by ASM activities. Limited employment opportunities in rural areas (82 %), economic hardships/poverty situations of people (59 %), and “quick” income earnings from ASM (90 %) were the major factors that influenced people to combine and use their personal assets to enable them to engage in ASM. ASM contributes to the livelihood enhancement through income generation, increased well-being and asset acquisition (50. 7 %), reduced vulnerabilities (31. 1 %), and empowerment of people (19. 2 %) to establish other economic activities. However, the small-scale miners and farmers as well as farmlands, forest, and water resources are most vulnerable to adverse effects of ASM <b>activities.</b> <b>Accidents</b> of various degrees, diseases, and death were the shocks in ASM. Regarding the massive impact of ASM on employment creation and poverty reduction in rural communities, it is recommended that stakeholders recast Ghana’s mineral policy to ensure concurrent environmental sustainability and socioeconomic development...|$|R

For fractures of the cranial and midfacial bones and mandible, only those patients who underwent closed reduction or open reduction and internal fixation in the operation room {{were included in the}} analysis. Patients treated with conservative management in the outpatient department were excluded. The investigated parameters were sex, age, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, time of injury (day of the week/month/year), region and cause of fracture, alcohol intoxication {{at the time of the}} injury, time from injury to surgery, hospitalization period, and postoperative complications. The causes of fracture were classified into the following six categories: ground accident, slipping on the ground and hitting the floor or nearby objects; fall, fall from a height that one’s feet could not reach; flying object, hit by a flying object; assault, intentionally or unintentionally hit by another person; sports <b>activity,</b> <b>accidents</b> during sports activities; and traffic accident, accidents involving automobiles. Surgery was performed by a specialist with at least 5  years of clinical experience in oral and maxillofacial surgery, plastic surgery, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, or neurosurgery. Medical records were reviewed by two surgeons, each with 3  years of clinical experience as oral and maxillofacial surgeons. The need for informed consent was waived.

40|$|Background In Australia, injury-causing {{accidents}} during led {{outdoor activities}} are currently problematic; however, the industry’s understanding of accidents is limited and the surveillance systems required to enhance it do not exist. This paper describes {{the development of}} a new accident analysis framework for led outdoor activities. Aims The aim of this research was to develop a new accident analysis framework for led outdoor activities. Methods Development of the framework was informed by three activities: 1. An analysis of existing led outdoor activity incident data; 2. A review of the accident causation literature; and 3. A review of existing accident analysis methods. The framework was then tested through analysis of a series of led outdoor activity incidents. Results The newly developed accident analysis framework comprises taxonomies of causal factors across the following led outdoor activity ‘system’ levels: Government policy and budgeting, Regulatory bodies and associations, Local area government planning and budgeting and company management, technical and operational management, physical processes and actor activities, and equipment and environment (Rasmussen, 1997). The test applications demonstrate that the framework can be used to identify causal factors across all levels of the led outdoor activity system. Contribution to the Field The new accident analysis framework provides a theoretically driven, structured methodology for analysing led outdoor <b>activity</b> <b>accidents.</b> Application of the framework will increase the sector’s understanding of accidents, which in turn will support development of more informed and effective countermeasures. The long term contribution will therefore be a reduction in accident and injury rates...|$|R
