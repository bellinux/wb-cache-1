2500|$|The {{radiation}} {{pattern of the}} feed antenna has to be tailored {{to the shape of}} the dish, because it has a strong influence on the <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiency,</b> which determines the antenna gain (see Gain section below).

[...] So the ideal {{radiation pattern}} of a feed antenna would be a constant field strength throughout the solid angle of the dish, dropping abruptly to zero at the edges.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaMultimode {{rectangular}} horn radiators {{have been}} in widespread use as reflector antenna feed elements for many years. These horns provide equal E and H planes over moderate bandwidths. With a few simple additional design considerations, however, these same horns can operate over two separate frequency bands. Dual mode operation is achieved by designing to prohibit generation of higher order beamshaping modes for lower operating band. Thus the horn operates as a square pyramidal horn at the low band and as a traditional multimode horn in the upper band. Upper band performance is not affected; however, efficiency in the lower band is somewhat less due to unequal beamshapes characteristic of square pyramidal horns. A horn utilizing these design concepts was developed and tested. Resultant horn geometry, corresponding reflector antenna <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and beamshapes at both bands are presented...|$|R

50|$|In general, the {{aperture}} of an antenna {{is not directly}} related to its physical size. However some types of antennas, for example parabolic dishes and horns, have a physical aperture (opening) which collects the radio waves.
