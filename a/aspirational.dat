5|$|The Lady's Realm was a British women's {{magazine}} published from 1896 until 1914, possibly until 1915. It primarily targeted upper-class readers {{as well as}} an <b>aspirational</b> middle-class audience, featuring photographs, poems, fiction, {{and columns}} by popular authors such as Marie Corelli, Frances Hodgson Burnett, Jack London, and H.G. Wells. The London Season was regularly covered, with visuals of significant society figures and débutantes appearing. Fashion trends in Paris and London were frequently discussed as well, particularly by its fashion editor Marian Pritchard.|$|E
5|$|The lyrics {{focus on}} how the bonding of two lovers can become so strong that they {{practically}} become one entity, through the act of sexual intercourse. Apart from the sexual connotations, there is an <b>aspirational</b> undercurrent to the lyrics, and like many of their subsequent songs, desire is explicitly linked to ambition–"Free your mind of doubt and danger/Be for real don't be a stranger/We can achieve it/We can achieve it".|$|E
5|$|Having, in his view, perfected many of {{his ideas}} and designs for steam engines, Evans turned his {{attention}} once more to the commercial propagation of his inventions. His first steam engines had been constructed on an ad-hoc basis, often with improvised tools and workers, and he had relied heavily on blacksmiths and other metal-working shops in Philadelphia with little experience in the more precise metal-work required to build steam engines. In particular, Evans soon realized that unlike his milling machines of wood and leather he would need specialist skills, precision tools and a large foundry {{in order to build}} steam machines on a commercial basis. Thus, Evans constructed the Mars Works on a large site a few blocks north of his store in Philadelphia. The choice of name, after the Roman god of war, is thought to have been <b>aspirational</b> and a challenge to the Soho Foundry near Birmingham in the United Kingdom, famous for building the Watt and Boulton engines. Indeed, the completed Mars Works was {{one of the largest and}} best equipped outfits of its kind in the United States—by contemporary accounts it featured a substantial foundry, moldmaker's shop, blacksmith's shops, millstone maker, a steam engine works and a large steam engine of its own to grind materials and work wrought iron. With over thirty-five staff, the Mars Works produced a wide range of manufactures ranging from working steam engines to cast iron fittings, as well as milling and farming machines for Evans's now well-established agricultural clientele. Steam engine orders alone proved insufficient to support the extensive business costs; hence the works became highly experienced in producing all kinds of heavy machinery, contributing to Philadelphia's emergence as a leading center for such work in the 19th century. Indeed, the works even received military orders, casting naval cannons during the War of 1812. Evans also proved highly innovative in designing steam power solutions for his clients. In one example where the Mars Works was commissioned to build engines for wool processing factories in Middletown, Connecticut, Evans designed a network of accompanying pipes with radiators to heat the factory with engine exhaust.|$|E

25|$|There {{were more}} than 1,200 {{maintained}} grammar schools, which were fully state-funded.

25|$|Some {{academic}} {{commentators have}} linked the increasing surfeit of Indian films and TV series on espionage thriller genre, where an Indian hero staves off impending global catastrophe, {{as a marker}} of an <b>aspirational</b> Pax Indica not based on 'older paradigms of internationalism based on universal brotherhood and non-violent pacifism associated with Gandhi and Nehru' but on the motif of an increasingly assertive potential superpower.|$|E

In her 2011 book Allah, Liberty and Love, she invites Muslims and non-Muslims to transcend the fears that stop many from living with integrity: the fear of offending others in a multicultural world {{as well as the}} fear of questioning their own communities. Manji asserts that change must start from within.|$|E

25|$|Tommy Hilfiger {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} brands in 1990s sportswear, though Polo Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Nautica, and DKNY were also popular. When Snoop Doggy Dogg wore a Hilfiger sweatshirt during an appearance on Saturday Night Live, it sold out of New York City stores the next day. Hilfiger's popularity was due to its perceived waspiness, which made it seem exclusive and <b>aspirational.</b> Moreover, Hilfiger courted the new hip hop market: black models featured prominently in the company's advertising campaigns, and rappers like Puffy and Coolio walked during its runways shows.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, certain {{costs are}} {{difficult}} to avoid and are shared by everyone, such as the costs of housing, pensions, education and health care. If the state does not provide these services, then for those on lower incomes, the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes {{are those who are}} worse equipped to manage their finances. Secondly, <b>aspirational</b> consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt. The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability.|$|E

She aggressively and successfully reengineered the entire apparel organization, and created three sub-brands for Nike apparel: Nike Performance, targeted to athletes and <b>aspirational</b> consumers; Nike Active, a line to be worn from gym to street; and Nike Fusion, apparel with higher-performance fabrics and aggressive styling. Under her leadership, Nike also rolled out new NikeWomen stores, launched NikeWomen catalogues, and started a new division called Fitness Dance. She advanced Nike's apparel innovation agenda, led the development and growth of the global women's business, and created and co-chaired Nike’s Global Women’s Leadership Council.|$|E

[...] The music site went on to praise the song for its 'fearless optimism'.|$|E
500|$|... "Impossible Is Nothing" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by Australian rapper Iggy Azalea for her debut studio album, The New Classic (2014). It was written by Azalea, The Invisible Men, Jon Turner, and Jon Mills of The Arcade. The track contains an interpolation of French-Lebanese composer Gabriel Yared's [...] "Proust", and was produced by The Invisible Men and The Arcade. A downtempo, hip hop song, it features a tinkering beat which comprises percussion instrumentation such as chimes and a glockenspiel. Azalea raps the track's <b>aspirational</b> lyrics with a mantra technique, pertaining to themes of perseverance, empowerment and underdog triumphalism.|$|E
500|$|An illness around 1431 left van der Paele {{unable to}} fulfil the {{functions}} of his office, and led him to reflect upon his position as canon and on his mortality. In response he endowed a chaplaincy {{to the church and}} commissioned this work from van Eyck. The artist was {{at the height of his}} fame and in high demand, and this, along with the large size of the panel, meant that the commission took a lot longer to complete than was initially envisioned; two completion dates can be found on the frame, implying that the earlier date was <b>aspirational</b> and missed.|$|E
500|$|Becky {{is not an}} <b>aspirational</b> character, she {{strives to}} be normal, {{satisfied}} with a [...] "hard up lifestyle". She has changed since her early days, having calmed down a little {{in terms of her}} often out of control behaviour. Of this Kelly comments: [...] "If someone had said to me that in three years' time she'd be Becky McDonald and would be behind the bar in the Rovers, I wouldn't have believed it [...] When Becky first came in she was a totally different character, but she's calmed down a lot and her softer side has come out." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 2010 Television Critics Association press tour in Los Angeles on July 29, 2010, {{producer}} Murphy {{said the}} series [...] "was inspired by <b>aspirational</b> sports {{movies of the}} 1980s like Breaking Away, Vision Quest, and Pittsburgh-set Flashdance", and also added that [...] "Hellcats is a show either for optimists or {{for people who are}} interested in learning the trade". Producer Welling said he was attracted to the series mainly because of the script, and he also felt the cheerleaders' world had not yet been tapped into on television. When asked why it picked up Hellcats, The CW replied saying the series is [...] "one of the underdogs" [...] and it liked the big production numbers.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{said that}} he wanted to make [...] "something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the {{adventure}} and all that" [...] but also have a conscience [...] "that maybe in the enjoying of it makes you think {{a little bit about the}} way you interact with nature and your fellow man". He added that [...] "the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our <b>aspirational</b> selves, what we would like to think we are" [...] and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans [...] "represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future".|$|E
500|$|... "There's Got to Be a Way" [...] is an R-pop music {{song with}} {{elements}} of gospel, lasting for a duration for four minutes and 52 seconds. The theme of social activism {{can be heard}} in the lyrics [...] "There’s got to be a way / to connect this world today." [...] The song begins with Carey publicly denouncing the existence of poverty and racism in the world, and she uses the bridge to shift the lyrics towards an uplifting and <b>aspirational</b> tone. Carey suggests we should be more tolerant of each other and not resort so readily to war in the lyrics [...] "Couldn't we accept each other / Can't we make ourselves aware." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Nana's Party" [...] is {{the fifth}} episode of the second series of the British dark comedy {{anthology}} television programme Inside No. 9. It was first broadcast on 23 April 2015 on BBC Two. Written and directed by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, the episode starred Claire Skinner as the obsessive-compulsive and <b>aspirational</b> Angela, who is hosting a party for the 79th birthday of her mother Maggie, played by Elsie Kelly. Angela's husband Jim, played by Pemberton, is keen to play a prank on Pat, Angela's brother-in-law, who is a practical joker. Pat is played by Shearsmith, while Carol, a recovering alcoholic who is Pat's wife and Angela's sister, is played by Lorraine Ashbourne. The episode also features Eve Gordon as Katie, Angela and Jim's teenage daughter, and Christopher Whitlow as a paramedic seen {{at the beginning and}} end of the episode.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on 19 May 2011 that David Beckham {{and his business}} partner, Simon Fuller, would be launching a men's bodywear line, a men's fragrance (with licensing partner Coty, Inc.), {{and a number of}} other projects to capitalize on Beckham's worldwide commercial appeal. The fragrance, entitled Homme by David Beckham, would join existing scents David Beckham Instinct (2005) and Intimately Beckham (2006), a his-and-hers collection with his wife Victoria Beckham. Steve Mormoris, senior vice president of global marketing for Coty Beauty, told Women's Wear Daily that the fragrance is a strategic launch for Coty that represents [...] "a key new orientation for the David Beckham fragrance brand— getting back to the male roots of the brand, enhancing David as an athlete and an <b>aspirational</b> man and building a new pillar to the David Beckham franchise." [...] Speaking of the new venture, Beckham said: ...|$|E
500|$|... "There's Got to Be a Way" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey from her self-titled debut studio album (1990). Columbia released it as the fifth and final single from the album in the United Kingdom. It {{was one of four}} songs Carey wrote with Ric Wake during their first recording session together in February 1990, but [...] "There's Got to Be a Way" [...] was the only composition to make the final track listing. It is a socio-political conscious R-pop song which addresses the existence of poverty, racism and war in the world which gradually becomes more <b>aspirational</b> and positive as it progresses. The track garnered a mixed reception upon the album's release in 1990. While Carey's vocals were praised, it was seen as too political. An accompanying music video highlights social injustices. The song reached number 54 on the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
500|$|In March 2011 Lancashire began {{starring}} {{in a new}} Cameron Mackintosh musical, Betty Blue Eyes, at the Novello Theatre. In the production, a loose adaptation of the 1984 film A Private Function, she starred as Joyce Chilvers, an <b>aspirational</b> housewife who Lancashire describes as [...] "brittle" [...] and [...] "capricious". Despite positive reviews the musical closed in London on 24 September 2011, after a run of just six months. For her performance Lancashire was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical. In 2012 she appeared as lady's maid Miss Whisset in the penultimate episode of the 2010 revival of Upstairs Downstairs. In September 2012 Lancashire began appearing as Head of Ladieswear Miss Audrey in the six-part series The Paradise set in a department store in Northern England in the late 19th century. Lancashire described her character as [...] "a true archetypal spinster" [...] who has long denied herself a romantic life and who begins to feel undermined by a younger colleague.|$|E
500|$|With <b>aspirational</b> lyrics, [...] "Impossible Is Nothing" [...] {{contains}} {{themes of}} perseverance, empowerment and [...] "underdog triumphalism". It also showcases ideas of prosocial behavior and [...] "blonde ambition". The lyrics welcome newcomers {{in the music}} industry, [...] "I even hope at one point you take it farther than me", and speak of self-empowerment: [...] "I shall never let 'em see me sweat / Promise to want for more until my very last breath / Promise to blaze a path and leave a trail for the next / And never sell out my soul for any number on a check". According to Lucy O'Brien of The Quietus, the lyrics portray Azalea as [...] "the hardworking Aussie girl and the feminist goddess urging with messianic fervour". John Lucas of The Georgia Straight describes the song as a [...] "bite-sized motivational seminar". [...] "Impossible Is Nothing" [...] was compared to songs by Eminem, specifically from his 2010 album Recovery.|$|E
500|$|The episode's action {{revolves}} around the practical joke involving the cake and, in particular, viewers' attempts to guess what has caused injury, as {{they know that the}} paramedic will be coming. Both Angela and the alcoholic Carol are [...] "ticking time-bomb". Angela is the central character, and is similar to a more anxious version of Sue Brockman, Skinner's character from Outnumbered. She is stressed and obsessive-compulsive, but <b>aspirational,</b> fastidious, and dutiful. The comedy critic Bruce Dessau compared Ashbourne's characterisation of Carol to Elizabeth Taylor's characterisation in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?; as the episode progresses, Carol becomes increasingly abusive. Commentators variously described Pat as [...] "appalling", [...] "tiresome", an [...] "irritating tit" [...] and [...] "an insufferable booby". For Chris Bennion, writing in The Independent, Pat's character is more complex: [...] "Behind Pat's cheesy jokes and schoolboy tomfoolery lies a desperately sad and dignified man, standing by and caring for a wife whose love for him has long gone." [...] Pat and Carol, for Pemberton and Shearsmith, have a more honest relationship than Jim and Angela, despite the problems in their relationship.|$|E
500|$|James Cameron {{has said}} that he [...] "tried to make a film that would touch people's spirituality across the broad spectrum." [...] He also stated that one of the film's {{philosophical}} underpinnings is that [...] "the Na'vi represent that sort of <b>aspirational</b> part of ourselves that wants to be better, that wants to respect nature, while the humans in the film represent the more venal versions of ourselves, the banality of evil that comes with corporate decisions that are made out of remove of the consequences." [...] Film director John Boorman saw a similar dichotomy as a key factor contributing to its success: [...] "Perhaps the key is the marine in the wheelchair. [...] He is disabled, but Mr Cameron and technology can transport him into the body of a beautiful, athletic, sexual, being. [...] After all, we are all disabled in one way or another; inadequate, old, broken, earthbound. [...] Pandora is a kind of heaven where we can be resurrected and connected instead of disconnected and alone." ...|$|E
500|$|A new logo {{was created}} for all of Beckham's {{commercial}} ventures {{in order to create}} a [...] "uniform visual identity" [...] for the brand. The mark, which was created by Alasdhair Willis, features the David Beckham name in the Replica Pro font, with a circular hole [...] "punched out of the script". The hole represents a football and a lens or viewfinder, which can [...] "spotlight a product detail or visual flourish on various marketing materials". Willis stated that the major challenge when creating the brand identity for Beckham was: [...] "How do you convey through a brand mark the sheer diversity of the David Beckham world?". He expanded his comment, stating that the identity needed to represent [...] "the future of the man as well as being true to his core DNA as one of the world's most respected and talented sportsmen. The identity needed to deliver against all these elements and at the same time be cool, relevant, desirable, versatile and accessible". Fuller added that the brand should also be <b>aspirational,</b> optimistic and inclusive.|$|E
500|$|Century Falls is conceptually much {{darker than}} its {{predecessor}} Dark Season and his later work, which Davies attributed to a trend that inexperienced writers [...] "get off on the dark stuff": in a BAFTA interview with Davies, Home recalled that she [...] "very nearly got into trouble because it did actually push at the boundaries which some of the powers-that-be would rather not have been pushed"; and a Daily Mail review of the series considered the show's themes of arson, black magic, and communal fear as being [...] "on a scale normally reserved for peak-time adult viewing". The series offered a sense of realism in its protagonist, who is not heroic and <b>aspirational,</b> has poor social skills, and is bluntly described by Ben as a [...] "fat girl", a practice that the Daily Mail praised as [...] "something that defies the Thought Police". Century Falls was the last script he wrote for the BBC's children's department for fourteen years. He had begun to formulate another successor: The Heat of the Sun, a series set over Christmas 1999 and New Year's Day 2000 that would have included the concepts of psychic powers and world domination.|$|E
500|$|By 2015, Paul Field {{called the}} new group [...] "an amazing success". [...] By that time, they {{produced}} 8 CDs and DVDs, and 3 new television series. [...] Field reported that the new group went through the same process as the original group in terms of audience acceptance and [...] "benchmarks of success". [...] They performed to sell-out audiences throughout Australia, had high sales of their DVDs and CDs, and won an ARIA in 2014. [...] According to Kathy McCabe of News Corp Australia, it took 18 months for the new group {{to be accepted by}} their audience. [...] McCabe credited their success to Watkins, who became the group's stand-out member. [...] According to Field, an American journalist called her young fans, who came to concerts dressed in yellow and wearing bows like her, the [...] "mini Emma army". [...] She was so popular, she starred in her own TV show, called [...] "Emma", without the other Wiggles, in 2015. [...] Field called her [...] "an <b>aspirational</b> role model" [...] for their young audience and reported that she had increased their fan base of girls. [...] Field stated that the audience emulated her fashion choices, opening up new merchandising possibilities for the group.|$|E
500|$|The {{bursting}} of {{the mining}} bubble was ruinous for Disraeli. By June 1825 {{he and his}} business partners had lost £7,000. Disraeli could not pay off {{the last of his}} debts from this debacle until 1849. He turned to writing, motivated partly by his desperate need for money, and partly by a wish for revenge on Murray and others by whom he felt slighted. There was a vogue for what was called [...] "silver-fork fiction"—novels depicting aristocratic life, usually by anonymous authors, read avidly by the <b>aspirational</b> middle classes. Disraeli's first novel, Vivian Grey, published anonymously in four volumes in 1826–27, was a thinly veiled re-telling of the affair of The Representative. It sold well, but caused much offence in influential circles when the authorship was discovered. Disraeli, then just [...] 23 years old, did not move in high society, as the numerous solecisms in his book made obvious. Reviewers were sharply critical on these grounds of both the author and the book. Furthermore, Murray and Lockhart, men of great influence in literary circles, believed that Disraeli had caricatured them and abused their confidence—an accusation denied by the author but repeated by many of his biographers. In later editions Disraeli made many changes, softening his satire, but the damage to his reputation proved long-lasting.|$|E
500|$|Strip Me {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 60, which indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews", based on 4 reviews. Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave Strip Me a C rating and wrote that it [...] "plays like one long, increasingly desperate pep talk. The only breather? 'Unexpected Hero,' a lovely late-Beatles-style ballad." [...] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted the album for [...] "retaining [...] same blend of well-manicured R and European sophistication" [...] of Bedingfield's debut album and commented that she [...] "plays it exceptionally safe, {{to the extent}} that she even tones down the self-empowerment of her first two records, preferring pristine blue-eyed soul and adult contemporary ballads, all tailored for an <b>aspirational</b> upscale lifestyle". Slant magazine's Jonathon Keefe found it [...] "single-minded in its uplifting, inspirational tone", writing in conclusion that [...] "Bedingfield uses her powerful voice to oversing most of her material, making Strip Me feel like even more of a sermon. It may not be the year's worst pop album, but it might just be the most exhausting and heavy-handed." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} media outlets. James Montgomery from MTV News {{commented that the}} video is [...] "grisly and garish, but also incredibly clever and visually arresting". T. Kyle writing for MTV Buzzworthy gave the video a positive feedback, writing [...] "Christina manages to be fun and provocative, the styling is beautiful and even <b>aspirational,</b> and Legendtina's body looks amazing". Sam Lansky from Idolator website complimented Aguilera's [...] "charming sense of humor" [...] and deemed [...] "Your Body" [...] as one of Aguilera's best music videos. Writing for Billboard, Jason Lipshut noted the video seemed to be inspired by the unending stream of violence on TV, but felt that Aguilera's clothing style in the video was the standout part. In {{a review of the}} video for Yahoo! Music, Lyndsey Park complimented the cultural references in the video, writing that [...] "it's enough to make even Seth MacFarlane or Dennis Miller's heads spin. And yet, somehow, it's all so very, very Xtina". Marc Hogan of Spin wrote that [...] "It might take us a few more viewings to get the joke, but at least there's enough amazing absurdity going on to make that prospect sound entertaining". On December 4, 2012, Fuse announced that [...] "Your Body" [...] was the number one video of 2012, based on online voting.|$|E
500|$|Judge John Deed {{presents}} a fictionalised {{version of the}} English legal system. The British Film Institute's Screenonline notes that [...] "Almost every week, Deed is seen presiding over cases being prosecuted by his ex-wife or defended by his on-off girlfriend (with occasionally help from his daughter)", highlighting how unlikely {{it would be for}} a real judge to have so many conflicts of interest in his court. It also notes that Deed's faults, such as his affairs with his therapist and with Francesca Rochester, prevent him from being [...] "a completely idealised heroic figure", and the fact that because all of his family and friends practise law, he is firmly entrenched in the legal system that he is constantly fighting against. Deed has been accused of hypocrisy, particularly for using his connections to bail Charlie after she destroyed GM crops in [...] "Exacting Justice". There is a belief in some legal circles that, although Judge John Deed is arguably the most unrealistic of contemporary legal dramas, viewers see Deed as an <b>aspirational</b> character taking on a corrupt establishment. Despite being picked apart by legal professionals, the cast and Newman were invited to the annual dinner of the Association of Women Barristers in 2006 as part of a drive to raise the profile and attract new members to the group.|$|E
