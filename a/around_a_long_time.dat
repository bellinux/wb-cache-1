This came in the 1920s, when classic female blues singers like Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith and Mamie Smith grew very popular; the first hit of this field was Mamie Smith's [...] "Crazy Blues". [...] These urban blues singers changed the idea of popular music from being simple songs that could be easily performed by anyone to works primarily associated with an individual singer. [...] Performers like Sophie Tucker, known for [...] "Some of These Days", became closely associated with their hits, making their individualized interpretations {{just as important as the}} song itself.|$|E
2500|$|Through Chrétien had {{supported}} Martin in {{his plans for}} cuts, he did not allow Martin {{to go as far}} as he would have liked with cutting various social programs and to devolve spending powers to the provinces as a way of cutting federal government expenditure. As a [...] "hard federalist", Chrétien fiercely objected to what he saw as the [...] "soft federalist" [...] Martin's attempts to weaken the power of the federal government under the guise of cutting the deficit. One senior Liberal later recalled about the Chrétien-Martin debate about reforming Old Age Security that: [...] "Martin had been told [...] "no" [...] by the prime minister three times and still he persisted...his insubordination was unprecedented. It got the point where Chrétien had to draw {{a line in the sand}} and say [...] "I'm the prime minister and you're the finance minister and I'm saying no!"". Much of the Liberal caucus was deeply unhappy with the 1995 budget, arguing that this was not what they had been elected for in 1993, only to be informed by the Prime Minister that there was no alternative. Chrétien himself expressed his unhappiness with his budget in a radio interview with Peter Gzowski in March 1995, saying about the budget: [...] "It is not our pleasure sir, I have to tell you that. I've been <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> It's no pleasure at all. I'm not doctrinaire, a right-winger. I'm a Liberal, and I feel like a Liberal, and it is painful.
