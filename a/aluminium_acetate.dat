Both elastin hydrolysate and fibronectin partially prevented fibroblast-mediated contraction. Hyaluronic acid was only slightly effective in reducing the collagen degradation rate and more fibroblast-mediated contraction of the material was found than for the native collagen fibres with elastin hydrolysate and fibronectin.

Aluminium toxicity (LD 50 / 24 h) evaluated as per Probit method {{was found to}} be 700 mg/kg body weight. One-fifth of lethal dose was taken as the sublethal dose. For acute dose studies, rats were given a single lethal dose of <b>aluminium</b> <b>acetate</b> orally for one day only and for chronic dose studies, the rats were administered with sublethal dose of <b>aluminium</b> <b>acetate</b> once in a day for 25 days continuously.

The results revealed that while acetylcholinesterase activity was inhibited, acetylcholine level was elevated differentially in all the above mentioned areas of brain under aluminium toxicity, exhibiting area-specific response. All these changes in the cholinergic system were subsequently manifested in the behavior of rat exhibiting the symptoms such as adipsia, aphagia, hypokinesia, fatigue, seizures, etc. Restoration of the cholinergic system and overt behavior of rat to the near normal levels under chronic treatment indicated the onset of either detoxification mechanisms or development of tolerance to aluminium toxicity in the animal which was not probably so efficient under acute treatment...|$|E
40|$|Nanocrystalline alumina {{has been}} {{obtained}} on the 100 -g scale by thermal decomposition of precursors {{resulting from the}} freeze-drying of aqueous solutions of different aluminium-containing products,namely <b>aluminium</b> <b>acetate</b> and aluminium L-lactate. Samples prepared at different temperatures (from 873 to 1573 K in steps of 100 K) were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and surface area measurements.

TEM and SEM images show the nanoparticulate character of the aluminas obtained at relatively low temperatures, with typical particle size in the 5 to 10 nm range.
