ResultsChildren with influenza were more often previously healthy and presenting with upper respiratory symptoms, while influenza negative patients typically had underlying medical conditions, and lower respiratory tract disease.

Many of these patients have respiratory virus infection but the exact burden of disease in defined clinical groups is unknown. Rhino-enteroviruses are increasingly implicated in severe <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>illness</b> in adults and advances in molecular diagnostics have led the recognition of high strain diversity and to the discovery of a new species (HRV-C).

40|$|Background: {{respiratory}} viruses are detectable in a {{large proportion}} of adults hospitalised with <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>illness.</b> For influenza and other viruses there is evidence that viral load and persistence are associated with certain clinical outcomes but it is not known if there is an association between viral load and hospital length of stay. Methods: 306 adults hospitalised with viral <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>illness</b> were studied. Associations between viral load and length of stay were examined. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to control for age, comorbidity, influenza vaccine status, duration of illness prior to hospitalisation, bacterial co-infection, clinical group and virus subtype. Results: high viral load was associated with a longer duration of hospitalisation for all patients (p < 0. 0001). This remained significant across all virus types and clinical groups and when adjusted for age, comorbidity, duration of illness prior to hospitalisation, bacterial co-infection and other factors. Conclusions: high viral loads are associated with prolonged hospital length of stay in adults with viral <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>illness.</b> This further supports existing evidence demonstrating that viral <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>illness</b> is a viral load driven process and suggests that viral load could be used in clinical practise to predict prolonged hospitalisation and prioritise antivirals.

40|$|Background <b>Acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>illness,</b> {{a leading}} cause of cough in children, {{accounts}} for a substantial proportion of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. In some children acute cough progresses to chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration), impacting on morbidity and decreasing quality of life. Despite the importance of chronic cough as a cause of substantial childhood morbidity and associated economic, family and social costs, data on the prevalence, predictors, aetiology and natural history of the symptom are scarce. This study aims to comprehensively describe the epidemiology, aetiology and outcomes of cough during and after <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>illness</b> in children presenting to a tertiary paediatric emergency department. Methods/design A prospective cohort study of children aged = 4 weeks duration) post presentation with <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>illness.</b> Demographic, epidemiological, risk factor, microbiological and clinical data are completed at enrolment. Subjects complete daily cough dairies and weekly follow-up contacts for 28 (+/- 3) days to ascertain cough persistence. Children who continue to cough for 28 days post enrolment are referred to a paediatric respiratory physician for review. Primary analysis will be the proportion of children with persistent cough at day 28 (+/- 3).
