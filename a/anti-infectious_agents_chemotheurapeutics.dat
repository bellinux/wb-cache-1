Antitreponemal antibodies were detected in 87 % of PNG sera versus 0 - 6 % of controls (P < 0. 0001). Anti-dsDNA antibodies were detected in 31 % of PNG samples, which was significantly higher than in three of the control groups (< 10 %). The outstanding high rate of antitreponemal antibodies detected in Kitavans possibly represents prior yaws disease. A low prevalence of cardiovascular disease was previously documented in Kitavans and has been attributed, in addition to their diet, to the high prevalence of natural cardioprotective autoantibodies (the IgM-antiphosphorylcholine antibodies) in this population. Treponemal infection has been shown to induce the appearance of antiphosphorylcholine antibodies. These protective autoantibodies may cross-react with the pathogenic anti-dsDNA antibodies.

It {{is even more}} unclear which factors may determine the subgroup (i. e., AMA status) of patients with PBC. We thus tested AMA+and AMA- PBC patients' sera for antibodies (Abs) against multiple infectious agents. METHODS: Sera from 69 patients with PBC (49 AMA+and 20 AMA-) and 100 matched controls were screened for IgG-Abs against Toxoplasma gondii, Helicobacter pylori, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C utilizing the BioPlex 2200 and ELISA kits (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). RESULTS: The prevalence of four <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agents</b> Abs was significantly elevated among PBC patients when compared with controls, namely anti-T. gondii (ATxA; 71 % vs. 40 %, p< 0. 0001), EBV early antigen (EA; 44 % vs. 12 %, p< 0. 0001), H. pylori (54 % vs. 31 %, p< 0. 01), and CMV (90 % vs. 75 %, p< 0. 05) Abs, respectively. The co-occurrence of these four <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agents</b> Abs was highly common in PBC, whereas this infection burden was rare in healthy subjects (20 % vs. 3 % respectively, p< 0. 0001). Furthermore, specific infections interactions possibly increasing PBC risk were noted as well. Seropositivity of ATxA was inversely associated with cirrhosis among PBC patients (p< 0. 05). Finally, no differences were observed between AMA- sera and their AMA+counterparts with regard to seroprevalence {{of any of the}} investigated infectious agents. CONCLUSIONS: We note the association of ATxA and PBC, with the possibility of a milder disease manifestation.

Here, we report the result of our preliminary screening of a series of 5 '-norcarbocyclic uridine analogues against protozoan parasites, specifically the major pathogens Leishmania mexicana and Trypanosoma brucei. The series displayed antiparasite activity in the low to mid-micromolar range and establishes a preliminary structure-activity relationship, with the 4 ',N(3) -di-(3, 5 -dimethylbenzoyl) -substituted analogues showing the most prominent activity. Utilizing an array of specially adapted cell lines, it was established that this series of analogues likely act through a common target. Moreover, the strong correlation between the trypanocidal and anti-leishmanial activities indicates that this mechanism is likely shared between the two species. EC 50 values were unaffected by the disabling of pyrimidine biosynthesis in T. brucei, showing that these uridine analogues do not act directly on the enzymes of pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism. The lack of cross-resistance with 5 -fluorouracil, also establishes that the carbocyclic analogues are not imported through the known uracil transporters, thus offering forth new insights for this class of nucleosides.

Five different extracts from Olea europaea, mastic gum, and Inula viscosa were tested against ten bacteria and one Candida albicans strain. The extraction protocols were conducted according to established experimental procedures. Two antimicrobial assays—the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assay—were applied.

In this review, we focus on the effects of diphenyl diselenide (DPDS) in various biological model organisms. DPDS possesses antioxidant activity, confirmed in several in vitro and in vivo systems, and thus has a protective effect against hepatic, renal and gastric injuries, in addition to its neuroprotective activity. The activity of the compound on the central nervous system has been studied since DPDS has lipophilic characteristics, increasing adenylyl cyclase activity and inhibiting glutamate and MK- 801 binding to rat synaptic membranes. Systemic administration facilitates the formation of long-term object recognition memory in mice and has a protective effect against brain ischemia and on reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia in rats. On the other hand, DPDS may be toxic, mainly because of its interaction with thiol groups. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the molecule acts as a pro-oxidant by depleting free glutathione. Administration to mice during cadmium intoxication has the opposite effect, reducing oxidative stress in various tissues. DPDS is a potent inhibitor of d-aminolevulinate dehydratase and chronic exposure to high doses of this compound has central effects on mouse brain, as well as liver and renal toxicity.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In 1990, the Commission for <b>Anti-infectious</b> <b>Agents</b> of the Swiss Society for Infectious Diseases {{decided to}} monitor trends in {{hospital}} consumption of antibiotics {{to understand better}} and rationalize their use. This article describes and analyzes the evolution {{in the use of}} aminoglycosides in Swiss university hospitals. METHODS: Annual consumption figures for four aminoglycosides were provided by pharmacists of participating hospitals for the period 1990 - 1993. RESULTS: Between 1990 and 1993, the overall consumption of oral and intravenous (i. v.) antibiotics increased by 22 % and 38 % respectively. On average, 38 % of hospitalized patients were receiving antibiotics in 1993 (0. 38 daily defined doses [DDD]/day). Aminoglycosides represented 11. 3 % of all i. v. antibiotics in 1990. There were wide differences between hospitals (range: 7. 9 to 36. 3 % DDD per 1000 days). The four-year trend showed relative stability of use in four hospitals and wide variations in two. Overall, gentamycin remains the most commonly used aminoglycoside while amikacin is less used and retains its role of second line drug. CONCLUSION: The analysis of hospital consumption of aminoglycosides in Swiss university hospitals shows that the trend in use is not identical in all hospitals and that there are wide differences between hospitals (some hospitals use five times more than others).

40|$|International audienceAntimicrobial {{resistance}} {{has become}} aggravated {{over the last}} 20 years. During this period pharmaceutical industries have focused on making incremental improvements on long-established antibiotics and, to an extent, sidelined the search for new drugs to overcome pharmaco-resistance strategies currently employed by pathogens. As a consequence bacterial infections are, to date, the most morbid and resistant among infectious diseases. This is, in particular, true for: diarrheic or respiratory infections, meningitis, sexually transmitted diseases and nosocomial infections. The {{time has come to}} discover innovative molecules for anti-infection therapies. Among new molecules with potential interest are antimicrobial peptides, {{an important component of the}} natural defenses of most living organisms. These are welcomed as serious candidates considering: their rapid microbicidal action, their broad spectrum of activity (bacteria, fungi, parasites, enveloped virus) and their original mechanism of action; the latter being difficult to evade by the resistance strategies employed by bacteria. Over the past decade, more than 700 microbicidal peptides have been inferred from various species including vertebrates. In the latter it is known that organs of the male genital tract express a potent and sophisticated anti-infectious defense system based partly on antimicrobial peptides. It follows that major reproductive organs such as the testis and epididymis are an ideal source for novel, highly specific microbicidal peptides. Using state-of-the-art proteomics and innovative syntactical biocomputing approaches, we identified numerous peptides with antimicrobial properties. This establishes the male genital tract as a veritable gold-mine for new <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agents</b> to be exploited for future medicine...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The hepatotoxic {{potential}} of statins is controversial. The objectives {{of this study}} were to describe the relative frequency of hepatotoxicity caused by statins and the phenotypes found in Spain. Patients and methods: The incidence of hepatotoxicity attributed to statins in the Spanish Hepatotoxicity Registry (REH) were studied and compared with those attributed to other drugs. Results: Between April 1994 and August 2012, the REH included a total of 858 cases of which 47 (5. 5 %) were attributed to statins. Of these, 16 were due to atorvastatin (34 %); 13 to simvastatin (27. 7 %); 12 to fluvastatin (25. 5 %); 4 to lovastatin (8. 5 %) and 2 to pravastatin (4. 3 %). Statins represented approximately half of the cardiovascular group which occupied 3. er place (10 %), after <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agents</b> (37 %) and central nervous system drugs (14 %). The hepatocellular pattern was predominant, especially in the simvastatin group (85 %), the cholestatic/mixed pattern was more frequent with fluvastatin (66 %) and had a similar distribution to atorvastatin. Patients with statin-induced toxicity were older (62 years versus 53 years, p < 0. 001) and more often demonstrated an autoimmune hepatitis phenotype (8. 5 % versus 1. 4 %, p < 0. 003). Conclusions: Statins are not a common cause of hepatotoxicity in Spain. Atorvastatin is the statin involved in the greatest number of incidents. The liver injury pattern varies among the different statins. The hepatitis phenotype with autoimmune features appears to be a characteristic signature of statin-induced hepatotoxicity...|$|R

Sera samples were also screened for antibodies against infectious agents (i. e., EBV, CMV, HBV, Helicobacter pylori, Treponema pallidum, and Toxoplasma gondii). Tests were performed using the BioPlex 2200 or ELISA kits (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). We found a significant gradient of ANA positivity among the groups: 45 % of Columbians, 38 % of Kitavans, 26 % of Mexicans, 12 % of Italians, 12 % of Dutch, and 11 % of Israelis were ANA positive. Geographical differences were also observed regarding the prevalence of specific autoantibodies, namely ANA: anti-dsDNA, chromatin, SmRNP, Ro/SSA, La/SSB, Scl 70; GI associated: antigliadin; and thrombophilia-associated: anti-beta 2 GP 1 and prothrombin. Additionally, significant differences were observed regarding serological markers of all infectious agents screened. The observed variance between healthy ethno-geographical distinct populations in prevalence of autoantibodies may represent different genetic or environmental (e. g., prior exposure to infection) influences. Thus may illuminate possible causes of geoepidemiological differences in AD...|$|R
40|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{constitute a}} family of drugs, which taken as a group, {{represents one of the}} most frequently prescribed around the world. Thus, not surprisingly NSAIDs, along with <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agents,</b> list on the top for causes of Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI). The incidence of liver disease induced by NSAIDs reported in clinical studies is fairly uniform ranging from 0. 29 / 100 000 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 17 - 051] to 9 / 100 000 (95 % CI: 6 - 15). However, compared with these results, a higher risk of liver-related hospitalizations was reported (3 - 23 per 100 000 patients). NSAIDs exhibit a broad spectrum of liver damage ranging from asymptomatic, transient, hyper-transaminasemia to fulminant hepatic failure. However, under-reporting of asymptomatic, mild cases, as well as of those with transient liver-tests alteration, in conjunction with reports non-compliant with pharmacovigilance criteria to ascertain DILI and flawed epidemiological studies, jeopardize the chance to ascertain the actual risk of NSAIDs hepatotoxicity. Several NSAIDs, namely bromfenac, ibufenac and benoxaprofen, have been withdrawn from the market due to hepatotoxicity; others like nimesulide were never marketed in some countries and withdrawn in others. Indeed, the controversy concerning the actual risk of severe liver disease persists within NSAIDs research. The present work intends (1) to provide a critical analysis of the dissimilar results currently available in the literature concerning the epidemiology of NSAIDS hepatotoxicity; and (2) to review the risk of hepatotoxicity for each one of the most commonly employed compounds of the NSAIDs family, based on past and recently published data...|$|R
40|$|Community-acquired {{pneumonia}} (CAP) is {{a common}} cause of morbidity among children in developed countries and accounts for an incidence of 10 - 40 cases per 1000 children in the first 5 years of life. Given the clinical, social and economic importance of CAP, there is general agreement that prompt and adequate therapy is essential to reduce {{the impact of the}} disease. The aim of this discussion paper is to consider critically the available data concerning the treatment of uncomplicated pediatric CAP and to consider when, how and for how long it should be treated. This review has identified the various reasons that make it difficult to establish a rational approach to the treatment of pediatric CAP, including the definition of CAP, the absence of a pediatric CAP severity score, the difficulty of identifying the etiology, limited pharmacokinetic (PK) /pharmacodynamic (PD) studies, the high resistance of the most frequent respiratory pathogens to the most widely used <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agents</b> and the lack of information concerning the changes in CAP epidemiology following the introduction of new vaccines against respiratory pathogens. More research is clearly required in various areas, such as the etiology of CAP and the reasons for its complications, the better definition of first-and second-line antibiotic therapies (including the doses and duration of parenteral and oral antibiotic treatment), the role of antiviral treatment and on how to follow-up patients with CAP. Finally, further efforts are needed to increase vaccination coverage against respiratory pathogens and to conduct prospective studies of their impact. © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

40|$|Hepatic {{fibrosis}} {{occurs as}} a wound-healing process after several forms of chronic hepatic injury. Activation and proliferation of hepatic stellate cells play {{pivotal role in}} the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis. Many researchers, from the therapeutic perspective, have focused their attention on searching for novel agents with inhibitory effects on hepatic stellate cells proliferation and activation to prevent hepatic fibrogenesis {{and a number of}} plant derived antioxidants have been tested as anti-fibrogenic agents, they generally suppress proliferation and collagen synthesis. Plants remain an imperative source of novel drugs, novel drug leads and new chemical entities. The plant based drug discovery resulted primarily in the development of antioxidant, anti-cancer and other <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agents</b> and continues to contribute to the new leads in clinical trials. This review summarizes some of those most important plant derived anti-fibrotic drugs and their beneficial effects on experimentally induced hepatic fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. The plant derived antioxidant compounds described herein are curcumin, silymarin, silibinin, baicalein, resveratrol, salvianolic acids, tetrandine, quercetin and berberine. Studies from ours and as demonstrated by pervious workers much information has been accumulated {{over the past two decades}} through in vivo and in vitro. In light of those studies, it has been confirmed that plants derived antioxidants, particularly flavanoids, show a significant influence to block hepatic fibrosis regardless of any etiology. This review outlines recent progress in the use of plant derived drugs against experimentally induced liver fibrosis by in vitro and in vivo studies and summarizes the possible mechanisms anti-fibrotic effects of these compounds...|$|R
40|$|Indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) catalyzes {{the first}} step in the {{degradation}} of tryptophan, an essential amino acid. During inflammation IDO can be induced in different cell types resulting in local tryptophan depletion. This inhibits T cell proliferation and may induce apoptosis. High expression of IDO was previously found in inflammatory bowel disease and is thought to represent a mechanism for downregulation of the local immune response. Our aim is to investigate the expression pattern of IDO in normal and inflamed murine and human intestinal mucosa. Immunohistochemical staining for IDO was performed on paraffin sections of colon of two mouse models for colitis and their controls and on paraffin sections of human ileum and colon in normal and two different inflammatory conditions, namely inflammatory bowel disease and diverticulitis. IDO immunohistochemistry showed similar results in murine and human tissue. In normal, as well as in inflamed mucosa, some mononuclear cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells were positive for IDO. In inflamed mucosa a specific expression pattern of epithelial IDO was found where epithelial cells flanking ulcers or bordering crypt abscesses showed high IDO expression. Moreover, in human intestinal inflammation, IDO was expressed in ulcer associated cell lineage. Since bacterial invasion is more pronounced in erosions and in crypt abscesses and since IDO activity and the resulting local tryptophan depletion can cause growth arrest of several tryptophan-dependent microorganisms, IDO expression in the vicinity of interruptions of the epithelial barrier may point to a role for IDO as a local <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agent.</b> Furthermore, expression of IDO at the margin of ulcerations and in the reparative ulcer-associated cell lineage suggests involvement of IDO in repair processes.

30|$|In this study, the peptide {{previously}} {{isolated from}} coelomocyte (blood cell) extracts {{of the green}} sea urchin, S. droebachiensis, centrocin 1 heavy chain (CEN 1 HC-Br) (Li et al. 2010) and the variants thereof, were evaluated for the potential as novel <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agents</b> by measuring their antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effect in vitro. CEN 1 HC-Br contains a brominated tryptophan in position two in the amino acid sequence (Li et al. 2010) with unknown function. AMPs containing brominated tryptophan have previously been characterized from several marine organisms such as hagfish intestinal antimicrobial peptides (HFIAPs), isolated from Atlantic hagfish or styelin D, isolated from tunicate Styela clava (Taylor et al. 2000; Uzzell et al. 2003). It has been speculated that the unusual amino acid bromotryptophan makes these AMPs less susceptible to proteolytic degradation and may increase the biological activity of the peptide (Li et al. 2010). To elucidate the functional significance of the bromination of the tryptophan residue, the debrominated variant of the centrocin 1 heavy chain, i.e. CEN 1 HC, {{was included in the}} assessments. To map the peptide region necessary of the biological activity, the C-terminal truncated variants of both peptides, CEN 1 HC-Br (1 – 20) and CEN 1 HC (1 – 20), were also tested. A free cysteine residue in the peptide sequence may potentially complicate the product development process due to the possible heterogeneity of the product caused by formation of disulphide bonds between molecules. Therefore, we investigated if the cysteine residue in CEN 1 HC (position 25) could be replaced by a similar amino acid. The most commonly used replacement for cysteine is serine, which in terms of geometry and volume occupancy is a highly isosteric analogue of cysteine. A cysteine to serine modified variant of CEN 1 HC, CEN 1 HC (Ser), was compared for microbicidal and anti-inflammatory properties to its non-substituted equivalent.|$|R
40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} are a serious concern worldwide especially in immune-compromised patients. Some of these {{diseases are}} considered to be contagious and are spread via airborne transmission, while others are not contagious, i. e. non-communicable diseases. The problem is compounded by the emergence of pathogens resistant to currently used antimicrobial drugs. A wide range of microbes including bacteria, fungi, parasites, viruses and protozoans are implicated as causative agents of various diseases. Many patients without ready access to Western medical facilities rely on medicinal plants for the cure of various ailments including infectious diseases. Two plant species used in South African traditional medicine for treating infectious diseases, namely Calodendrum capense Thunb. (Rutaceae) and Lydenburgia cassinoides N. Robson (syn. Catha transvaalensis, Celastraceae) were screened for antimicrobial activities against a range of fungi, bacteria and mycobacteria. The test organisms included Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium smegmatis and M. bovis BCG. The L. cassinoides acetone extract generally had good activity, with MIC values ranging from 0. 04 to 0. 15 mg/ml while the C. capense extract MIC values ranged from 0. 31 to 0. 62 mg/ml against the fungi. The hexane extract of L. cassinoides had good activity (MIC = 0. 04 mg/ml) against M. smegmatis and the methanol extract had MIC = 0. 16 mg/ml against M. bovis BCG. The two plant species had reasonable antibacterial activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, with MIC values ranging from 0. 16 to 0. 32 mg/ml. Antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis resulted in MIC = 0. 63 mg/ml for both plants. However in the bioautography assay, the hexane extracts of C. capense and L. cassinoides had good activity against S. aureus, showing active zones of bacterial growth inhibition. The aim {{of this study was to}} isolate and characterize the active compounds, with emphasis on antifungal activity, from Calodendrum capense and Lydenburgia cassinoides that may be useful in treating opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. Bioassay-guided evaluation of the antimicrobial active components of both hexane fractions using C. neoformans and C. albicans as test organisms led to the isolation and characterization of lupeol from C. capense and ß-amyrin from L. cassinoides. The MIC values of lupeol and ß-amyrin ranged from 1. 5 to 6. 2 µg/ml against all the tested organisms. Both compounds were also tested against a resistant strain of Candida albicans which resulted in MICs of 3. 2 and 6. 2 µg/ml respectively. Crude extracts and compounds were also tested for cytotoxicity against human liver (C 3 A) cells. The crude plant extracts had a low cytotoxicity with average LC 50 values of 205. 8 ± 8. 38 µg/ml for L. cassinoides and 83. 07 ± 44. 66 µg/ml for C. capense. LC 50 values for the isolated compounds were greater than 200 µg/ml, the highest concentration tested. Selectivity index (SI) values were calculated using the formula SI = LC 50 /MIC. The SI values of the crude extracts of the two plant species ranged between 0. 18 and 0. 91, showing that these extracts were relatively toxic compared to the antimicrobial activity as the SI values were less than 1. However, the compounds ß-amyrin and lupeol had good activity and low toxicity with SI values greater than 10. In conclusion both plant species showed broad-based antimicrobial activity against the standard ATCC strains of bacterial and laboratory isolates of fungal pathogens. Purified compounds with very good antifungal activity and negligible detectable cytotoxicity, namely lupeol from C. capense and ß-amyrin from L. cassinoides (both pentacyclic triterpenoids) were isolated. This is apparently the first report of these two compounds from these two plant species. In our research group, lupeol has been isolated from various other plant species and it is known to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. The second compound, ß-amyrin, reportedly has anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antibacterial, gastroprotective and hepatoprotective effects. The findings from this study show that the two isolated compounds were highly active against fungal and bacterial pathogens, with the lowest MIC value of 0. 015 mg/ml. Both compounds showed much better selectivity index values with regard to antifungal activity compared to those of the crude extracts. The compounds also had good activity against the two Mycobacterium strains tested, indicating potential application in antimycobacterial therapy. The results may validate to an extent the use of these two plants as <b>anti-infectious</b> <b>agents</b> in traditional medicine. The compounds have potential for development into therapeutic agents, but various factors will need to be investigated further, including in vivo efficacy and safety, as well as other aspects such as mode of administration.
