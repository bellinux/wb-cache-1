5|$|At the egg stage, {{pieces of}} the inner layer (the receptaculum) can be cut out with a knife <b>and</b> <b>eaten</b> raw. They are crisp and crunchy with an {{attractive}} radishy taste. The fungus is enjoyed <b>and</b> <b>eaten</b> in France and parts of Germany, where it may be sold fresh or pickled and used in sausages. Similar species are consumed in China.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is valued}} for its peppery flavor <b>and</b> <b>eaten</b> after {{suitable}} preparation in Russia and Finland, {{the species is}} highly irritating to the digestive system when eaten raw. The toxins, also responsible for the strongly bitter or acrid taste, are destroyed by cooking. Studies have identified several chemicals present in the mushrooms, including ergosterol and derivatives thereof, and the pungent-tasting velleral.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{high risk}} of predation, {{dolphins}} often avoid regions inhabited by tiger sharks. Injured or ailing whales may also be attacked <b>and</b> <b>eaten.</b> A group was documented killing an ailing humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) in 2006 near Hawaii. A scavenger, the tiger shark will feed on dead whales, and have been documented doing so alongside great whites.|$|E

Further controversy broke out with the discovery that Tara was partly Siberian tiger.|$|E
5|$|Jerusalem kugel (kugel yerushalmi) is an Israeli {{version of}} the {{traditional}} noodle pudding, kugel, made with caramelized sugar and spiced with black pepper.

5|$|Puffins {{have been}} hunted by man since time immemorial. Coastal {{communities}} and island dwellers with few natural resources at their disposal, made {{good use of}} the seafoods that they found on their cliffs and shores. Puffins were caught <b>and</b> <b>eaten</b> fresh, salted in brine or smoked and dried. Their feathers were used in bedding and their eggs were eaten, {{but not to the}} same extent as those of some other seabirds, being more difficult to extract from the nest. In most countries, Atlantic puffins are now protected by legislation, and in the countries where hunting is still permitted, strict laws prevent over-exploitation. They are still caught <b>and</b> <b>eaten</b> in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but there have been calls for an outright ban on hunting them in Iceland because of concern over the dwindling number of birds successfully raising chicks.|$|E

40|$|Sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> {{may have}} {{behavioral}} and psychological relationships and have cortical regions in common. This research investigated the general relationship between sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> from a reward perspective {{among the general}} population. Two-hundred and sixty-one Chinese participants were recruited via the internet (136 males, 125 females, mean age 30. 46 years) to fill in questionnaires about wanting and liking for sex <b>and</b> <b>eating.</b> The results revealed that first, there was {{a positive correlation between}} wanting for sex <b>and</b> wanting to <b>eat</b> only for males. Second, the relationship between liking for sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> was also positive for males and not significant in females. Third, the correlation between sociosexual orientation <b>and</b> wanting to <b>eat</b> was significant only in females, and there was no significant correlation between sociosexual orientation <b>and</b> liking for <b>eating.</b> Fourth, emotional sex cravings (or emotional sexual activity) was positively correlated with emotional food cravings (or emotional eating behavior), with a higher magnitude correlation in males than females. Finally, analysis of wanting (liking) models of sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> for males <b>and</b> females revealed three models for wanting among females: high wanting, low wanting for <b>eating,</b> <b>and</b> low wanting for sex; and two models for wanting among males: high wanting and low wanting. Liking for sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> among females consisted of two types of model: high liking and low liking; whereas three type models existed for males: high liking for sex, high liking for <b>eating,</b> <b>and</b> low liking. In general, our research revealed that, as with other natural rewards, sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> have considerable commonality and are related in numerous ways...|$|R

5|$|Adult mockingbirds {{can fall}} victim to birds of prey such as the great horned owl, screech owl and sharp-shinned hawk, though their {{tenacious}} behavior makes them less likely to being captured. Scrub-jays also have killed <b>and</b> <b>eaten</b> mockingbirds. Snakes rarely capture incubating females. Fledgelings have been prey to domestic cats, red-tailed hawks, and crows. Eggs and nestlings are consumed by blue jays, fish crows and American crows, red-tailed hawks, swallow-tailed kites, snakes, squirrels, and cats. Blowfly larvae and Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} Florida and Arizona populations, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Another {{threat to}} {{albatrosses}} is introduced species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack albatrosses or their chicks and eggs. Albatrosses {{have evolved to}} breed on islands where land mammals are absent and have not developed defences against them. Even species as small as mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan albatrosses are attacked <b>and</b> <b>eaten</b> alive by introduced house mice. Introduced species can have other indirect effects: cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island, threatening the Amsterdam albatross; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat.|$|E
5|$|Apples are an {{important}} ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake. They are often eaten baked or stewed, and {{they can also be}} dried <b>and</b> <b>eaten</b> or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for later use. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are also used (cooked) in meat dishes.|$|E

40|$|Symptoms {{of muscle}} dysmorphia, body dysmorphic disorder, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> {{disorders}} in a nonclinical population of adult male weightlifters in Australia. J Strength Cond Res 29 (5) : 1406 – 1414, 2015 —The current study aimed to (a) determine {{the rates of}} symptoms of muscle dysmorphia (MD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorder; (b) determine the relationships among symptoms of MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders; <b>and</b> (c) provide a comprehensive comparison of symptoms of MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders in a nonclinical population of adult male weightlifters in Australia. The participants (N = 648, mean age = 29. 5 years, SD = 10. 1) participated in an online survey, consisting of Muscle Appearance Satisfaction Scale, the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire, and the Eating Attitude Test- 26. Results indicated that 110 participants (17 %) were {{at risk of having}} MD, 69 participants (10. 6 %) were at risk of having BDD, and 219 participants (33. 8 %) were at risk of having an eating disorder. Furthermore, 36 participants (5. 6 %) were found at risk of having both MD and BDD, and 60 participants (9. 3 %) were at risk of having both MD <b>and</b> an <b>eating</b> disorder. Significant correlations and associations were found between symptoms of MD and BDD, and symptoms of MD <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders. Support was provided for the comorbidity of, and symptomatic similarities between, symptoms of MD and BDD, and symptoms of MD <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders. This may reflect a shared pathogenesis between symptoms of MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders. Strength <b>and</b> conditioning professionals, exercise scientists, athletic trainers, and personal trainers should be aware that adult males who are working out with weights (i. e., free weights or machines) may be at increased risk of having MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders...|$|R

5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's {{investigation}} of female fireflies {{of the genus}} Photuris revealed they emit the same light signals that females of the genus Photinus use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics, and are subsequently captured <b>and</b> <b>eaten.</b> Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating signals that have become modified for predation.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees, {{despite their}} ability to sting, are eaten by certain predators. Nests may be dug up by badgers <b>and</b> <b>eaten</b> whole, {{including}} any adults present. Adults are preyed upon by robber flies and beewolves in North America. In Europe, birds including bee-eaters and shrikes capture adult bumblebees on the wing; smaller birds such as great tits also occasionally learn to take bumblebees, while camouflaged crab spiders catch them as they visit flowers.|$|E
