5|$|In practice, Russian women saw mixed {{gains in}} their rights under Communism. Women's {{suffrage}} was granted, though voting meant little in Soviet society {{owing to the}} Communist Party's monopoly on power. This monopoly also meant that many independent feminist organizations and journals were shut down. Abortion was legalized in 1920, making the Soviet Union the first country to do so; however, it was banned again between 1936 and 1955. Generous maternity leave was legally required, and <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>network</b> of child-care centers was established. The country's first constitution recognized the equal rights of women.|$|E

Since the Ferguson protests, participants in {{the movement}} have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody. In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became involved in the 2016 United States presidential election.
