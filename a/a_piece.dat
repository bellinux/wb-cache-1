5|$|Partner {{communication}} {{is essential in}} a good defense. When one partner is under attack, the other partner {{should be aware of}} which pieces hurt most.

On the other hand, it results in the attacker having <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> less to play with, with the defender's partner having <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender an opportunity to take initiative.|$|E
5|$|Sargent's break {{came when}} Sir Henry Wood visited De Montfort Hall, Leicester, early in 1921 with the Queen's Hall orchestra.

Sargent completed the work too late for Wood to {{have enough time to}} learn it, and so Wood called on Sargent to conduct the first performance himself. Wood recognised not only the worth of the piece but also Sargent's talent as a conductor and gave him the chance to make his debut conducting the work at Wood's annual season of promenade concerts, generally known as the Proms, in the Queen's Hall on 11 October of the same year.|$|E

Vasishat suggested in 1985 that these teeth were instead p4s corresponding to molars referable to Sivaladapis, but this hypothesis has been disproven by the discovery of p4s referable to Indraloris.|$|E
