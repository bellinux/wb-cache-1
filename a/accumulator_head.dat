5000|$|In [...] Extrusion Blow Molding (EBM), plastic {{is melted}} and {{extruded}} {{into a hollow}} tube (a parison). This parison is then captured by closing it into a cooled metal mold. Air is then blown into the parison, inflating it {{into the shape of}} the hollow bottle, container, or part. After the plastic has cooled sufficiently, the mold is opened and the part is ejected. [...] Continuous and Intermittent are two variations of Extrusion Blow Molding. In Continuous Extrusion Blow Molding the parison is extruded continuously and the individual parts are cut off by a suitable knife. In Intermittent blow molding there are two processes: straight intermittent is similar to injection molding whereby the screw turns, then stops and pushes the melt out. With the accumulator method, an accumulator gathers melted plastic and when the previous mold has cooled and enough plastic has accumulated, a rod pushes the melted plastic and forms the parison. In this case the screw may turn continuously or intermittently. With continuous extrusion the weight of the parison drags the parison and makes calibrating the wall thickness difficult. The <b>accumulator</b> <b>head</b> or reciprocating screw methods use hydraulic systems to push the parison out quickly reducing the effect of the weight and allowing precise control over the wall thickness by adjusting the die gap with a parison programming device.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDesign {{procedure}} of large {{blow moulding machine}} rack is discussed in the article. A strength checking method is presented. Finite element analysis is conducted in the design procedure by ANSYS software. The actual situation of the rack load bearing is fully considered. The necessary means to simplify the model are done. The dimensional linear element Beam 188 is analyzed. MESH 200 is used to mesh. Therefore, it simplifies the analysis process and improves computational efficiency. The maximum deformation of rack is 8. 037 mm: it is occurred {{in the position of}} <b>accumulator</b> <b>head.</b> The result states: it meets the national standard curvature which is not greater than 0. 3 % of the total channel length; it also meets strength requirement that the maximum stress was 54. 112 MPa...|$|E
