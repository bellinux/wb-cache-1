25|$|When larvae hatch {{from their}} eggs, {{they are either}} red or yellow. Their bodies have a slender and flat {{appearance}} with short legs due to their minimal movement. The larvae are covered in hair and have two horn-type projections on the dorsal area of the last body segment. Immediately after birth, they start searching for food close to where they hatched. They feed on wood-borer insects on trees, or feed on their species' substrate or prey of choice. Feeding is {{the main purpose of}} the larval stage to prepare for pupation. Once their larval stage is complete the tree dwelling species {{make their way to the}} bottom of the tree to pupate. The pupal stage can last from 6 weeks to one year depending on the need to overwinter, and how short the overall lifecycle is for a particular species. A majority of clerid species pupate in earthen cells which are made from soil and certain enzymes secreted from their mouths. The rest remain in pupal cells. Adult beetles emerge from pupation <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> variable time of their life maturing, and eventually oviposit. Sexually mature adults or imagos of Thanasiumus sp. overwinter inside the wood-borer-infested trees and oviposit during the spring.|$|E
25|$|Larvae hatch about 12–21 {{hours after}} the eggs have been laid. The larvae are a cream color. C. hominivorax larvae dive head-first into {{whatever}} food source is nearest, and burrow deeper, eating into live flesh if available. This results in a pocket-like lesion that causes severe pain to the host. C. macellaria larvae only feed on the necrotic tissue of a wound. After 5 to 7 days, the larvae drop and {{move away from the}} food source to pupate. The larvae burrow into the first layer of topsoil, beneath leaves or garbage, and begin their pupation. The pupa is a dark brown color. This stage can last from 7 days at a warm temperature to as long as two months if the weather is much colder. The adults emerge <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> day or two finishing maturity. Adults of C. hominivorax breed only once in their lifetimes. Sexually mature adults breed 3–4 days after emerging from the pupa. Males mature rapidly, and spend their time waiting and eating nearby vegetation and the nectar of flowers. The females, however, are predatory, and feed on the fluids from live wounds. The females can fly long distances to find a mate. The adult flies of this species live around two to three weeks.|$|E
