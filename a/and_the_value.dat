5|$|Cley {{and nearby}} Blakeney had been prosperous and {{important}} ports in the Middle Ages, but land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the wharf. Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost to Blakeney and other Norfolk ports. The population stagnated, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of all property decreased sharply.

5|$|For the 2010 Ski Flying World Cup season, {{beginning}} in Oberstdorf, and from thereon used at all ski flying and ski jumping events, a supplementary points system was introduced. This system {{takes into account}} the wind speed and direction during each jump, as well as mid-round start gate adjustments, in order to enable a more fair contest. If a headwind is present, this is deemed an unfair advantage and points are therefore deducted as 'compensation'; if a tailwind is present, this is deemed to be a disadvantage and additional points are awarded instead. The amount of deduction or addition is calculated via coefficient using complex instrumentation which analyses the wind conditions at the time of a jump, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of the points themselves are in minimum increments of 0.1.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{we tried to}} {{identify}} variables that are differently related to social dominance orien-tation (SDO) and authoritarianism. A strong positive relationship between SDO and authoritarianism was found and both variables showed strong positive correlations with racism. Nevertheless, results {{support the idea that}} SDO and authoritarianism refer to different kinds of dispositional prejudice. Authoritarianism, when statistically corrected for SDO, was negatively associated with level of education, moral competence, relativism, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> hedonism, stimulation <b>and</b> self-direction, whereas positive correlations with age, cultural conservatism, orthodoxy, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> tradition, conformity <b>and</b> security were registered. In contrast, SDO, when corrected for authoritarianism, was negatively associated with age, second naiveté <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> universalism, benevolence <b>and</b> tradition, whereas economic conservatism, external critique, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> power, achievement, hedonism and stimulation showed positive relationships. It is argued that SDO represents a more modern kind of prejudice than authoritarianism. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Land {{reclamation}} schemes, {{especially those}} by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the silting up of the Glaven shipping channel and relocation of Cley's wharf.

Blakeney's shipping trade benefited from the silting up of its nearby rival, and in 1817 the channel to the Haven was deepened to improve access.
