5|$|On 26 October 2010, a {{military}} court convicted {{air traffic controller}} Sgt. Jomarcelo Fernandes dos Santos, sentencing him to 14 months in jail for failing to take action {{when he saw that}} the Embraer's <b>anti-collision</b> system had been turned off. Santos will remain free pending the outcome of the appeal process. Four other controllers were acquitted for lack of proof. On 17 May 2011, Judge Mendes sentenced air traffic controller Lucivando Tiburcio de Alencar to a term of up to three years and four months but ruled he is eligible to do community service in Brazil instead and acquitted Santos on charges of harming Brazil's air transport safety.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight control}} system of the Super Puma uses a total of 4 dual-body servo units for pitch control of the cyclic, collective, and tail rotor. A duplex digital {{autopilot}} is also incorporated. The cockpit is equipped with dual flight controls. Principle instrumentation constitutes of four multifunction liquid crystal displays along with two display and autopilot control panels; for redundancy, a single Integrated Standby Instrument System (ISIS) and Vehicle Monitoring System (VMS) are also fitted. According to Airbus Helicopters, the avionics installed upon later variants has ensured {{a high level of}} operational safety. Third party firms have offered various upgrades for the Super Puma, these have included integrated flight management systems, global positioning systems (GPS) receivers, a digital map display, flight data recorders, an <b>anti-collision</b> warning system, Night Vision Goggles-compatibility, and multiple radios.|$|E
25|$|The P-X shares some {{components}} {{with the}} C-X, later {{designated as the}} Kawasaki C-2, another indigenously-developed aircraft to replace the Kawasaki C-1 and C-130H Hercules cargo aircraft. The P-X and C-X designs were originally independent, {{it was decided that}} having common components to both designs would be useful. The JDA mandated that the two aircraft share identical body components; common components include the cockpit windows, outer wings, horizontal stabilizer, and other systems. Internal shared parts include the auxiliary power unit, cockpit panel, flight control system computer, <b>anti-collision</b> lights, and gear control unit. Due to the different roles of the two aircraft, they remain distinctly separate. The sharing of development resources had allowed for a large reduction in overall development costs which, when including the C-2, were reported as being 345 billion Yen ($3 billion) in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Kawasaki {{developed}} the C-X {{in parallel with}} the P-X, which it had also been selected to develop. As a cost saving measure, major airframe parts and system components were shared between the two aircraft. They use the same basic wing structure, although it is installed at different sweep angle and dihedral on the two versions, with different high lift devices and powerplant attachments. Common components include the cockpit windows, outer wings, horizontal stabilizer, and other systems. Internal shared parts include the auxiliary power unit, cockpit panel, flight control system computer, <b>anti-collision</b> lights, and gear control unit. As of 2007, the total development cost for the two aircraft has been 345 billion yen (or roughly equal to $2.9 billion), which is low compared to similar programs; for example, the development contract for the Boeing P-8 Poseidon alone was $3.89 billion.|$|E
500|$|In {{an initial}} deposition, the Embraer flight crew testified {{that they were}} cleared to flight level 370, {{approximately}} [...] above mean sea level, by Brasilia ATC, and were level at that assigned altitude when the collision occurred. They also asserted {{that at the time}} of the collision they had lost contact with Brasilia ATC, and their <b>anti-collision</b> system did not alert them to any oncoming traffic.|$|E
500|$|Congressmen Sherman P. Lloyd (R-Utah) and Henry S. Reuss (D-Wis) both {{decried the}} actions of the Marine jet fighter, which media at the time {{indicated}} had been [...] "stunting" [...] prior to the collision. In actuality, the 360° aileron roll maneuver the fighter pilot executed was to observe any air traffic above or below the aircraft. Lloyd said that military aircraft should be required to establish contact with air traffic controllers when entering high-traffic air corridors and around airports, while Reuss advocated the complete ban of military aircraft from any high-traffic civilian air corridors. Senator Frank Moss (D-Utah) sponsored a bill in December that would require the installation of <b>anti-collision</b> gear on all aircraft by 1975.|$|E
500|$|About 1454Z (now 0954 CDT {{due to the}} flight's {{crossing}} {{into the}} Central Time zone), a U.S. Air Force F-16 test pilot from the 40th Flight Test Squadron at Eglin AFB in western Florida, {{who happened to be}} in the air nearby, was directed by controllers to intercept N47BA. When the fighter was about [...] from the Learjet, at an altitude of about , the test pilot made two radio calls to N47BA but did not receive a response. The F-16 pilot made a visual inspection of the Lear, finding no visible damage to the airplane. Both engines were running, and the plane's red rotating <b>anti-collision</b> beacon was on (standard operation for aircraft in flight). The fighter pilot could not see inside the passenger section of the airplane because the windows seemed to be dark. Further, he stated that the entire right cockpit windshield was opaque, as if condensation or ice covered the inside. He also indicated that the left cockpit windshield was opaque, although several sections of the center of the windshield seemed to be only thinly covered by condensation or ice; a small rectangular section of the windshield was clear, with only a small section of the glare shield visible through this area. He did not see any flight control movement. At about 1512Z, the F-16 pilot concluded his inspection of N47BA and broke formation, proceeding to Scott AFB in southwestern Illinois.|$|E
2500|$|Investigation of the {{wreckage}} failed to determine if either had a working <b>anti-collision</b> light {{and it was only}} possible to determine the height of the accident by the use of eye witness accounts. The collision occurred in good visibility at an estimated height above ground level of [...] The investigation could find no evidence to suggest that either of the pilots had a medical problem or that either aircraft had any defect that would have contributed to the accident.|$|E
2500|$|Strobe {{lights are}} used in {{scientific}} and industrial applications, in clubs where {{they are used to}} give an illusion of slow motion, and are often used for aircraft <b>anti-collision</b> lighting both on aircraft themselves and also on tall stationary objects, such as television and radio towers. Other applications are in alarm systems, emergency vehicle lighting, theatrical lighting (most notably to simulate lightning), and as high-visibility running lights. [...] They are still widely used in law enforcement and other emergency vehicles, though they are slowly being replaced by LED technology in this application, as they themselves largely replaced halogen lighting. Strobes are used by scuba divers as an emergency signaling device.|$|E
2500|$|The Konkan Railway (abbreviated KR and कोरे) is a {{subsidiary}} {{zone of the}} Indian Railways. It {{is one of the}} 17 zones of the Indian Railways but without any divisional structure unlike other railways zones in India. It is operated by Konkan Railway Corporation limited, headquartered at CBD Belapur in Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra. The first passenger train ran on Konkan railway tracks on 20 March 1993 between Udupi and Mangalore. During its initial years of operation in the mountainous Konkan region, a spate of accidents prompted Konkan Railway to investigate new technologies. The <b>anti-collision</b> devices, the Sky Bus and RORO {{are a few of the}} innovations from Konkan Railway. It was the missing link between Mumbai, Maharashtra and [...] Mangalore, Karnataka and the southwestern coastal cities of India. The 741km (461mi) line connects Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka states in India. The first train on the completed track was flagged off on January 26, 1998, the Republic Day of India.|$|E

50|$|In civil aviation, pilots {{must keep}} {{navigation}} lights on from sunset to sunrise. High-intensity white strobe lights {{are part of}} the <b>anti-collision</b> light system, as well as the red rotating beacon.|$|E
50|$|Certain TV {{lift systems}} can be {{equipped}} with a contact strip or a programmable <b>anti-collision</b> monitoring system. The latter is absolutely necessary {{in the case of}} autonomously operating systems. If the TV lift has a dead man's switch, then the TV lift system stops as soon as the operator releases the button on the radio receiver. In the case of the <b>anti-collision</b> monitoring system, the power supply is measured. If the amount of power increases rapidly to a peak, the control box stops and lets the TV lift move in the opposite direction in order to dislodge the obstacle.|$|E

50|$|Procedural safety {{checks of}} the <b>anti-collision</b> systems were {{completed}} twice each day, when the trains were first placed in service and next between 2:00 and 3:00 p.m. Additional safety checks such as visually inspecting the carbon collector shoes were also performed each afternoon.|$|E
50|$|Because {{collision}} with other gliders is a risk, the <b>anti-collision</b> device FLARM {{is becoming increasingly}} common in Europe and Australia. In the longer term, gliders may eventually be required in some European countries to fit transponders once devices with low power requirements become available.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anti-collision</b> {{lights are}} {{flashing}} {{lights on the}} top and bottom of the fuselage, wingtips and tail tip. Their purpose is to alert others when something is happening that ground crew and other aircraft need to be aware of, such as running engines or entering active runways.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, Alpine Products, one of {{the largest}} {{manufacturer}} of alpine slides, entered the market with its [...] "Alpine Mountain Coaster".

5000|$|Wu - Infantry / Bowmen - Have high attack damage, attack speed, movement, but lowest {{health and}} armor-defense. Mainly use large wooden [...] "Paddles", short weapons (like swords) and shields. Bowmen have very long attack range, good load speed (rate of fire), but poor melee and <b>anti-collision</b> capabilities.|$|E
50|$|All {{aircraft}} built after 11 March 1996 {{must have}} an <b>anti-collision</b> light system (strobe lights or rotating beacon) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. The <b>anti-collision</b> system is recommended in good visibility, where only strobes and beacon are required. For example, just before pushback, the pilot must keep the beacon lights on to notify ground crews that the engines are about to start. These beacon lights stay on {{for the duration of}} the flight. While taxiing, the taxi lights are on. When coming onto the runway, the taxi lights go off and the landing lights and strobes go on. When passing 10,000 feet, the landing lights are no longer required, and the pilot can elect to turn them off. The same cycle in reverse order applies when landing.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} system include an engine-driven hydraulic pump, a hydraulic reservoir/accumulator, and filter. The electrical systems involve a 24-volt battery, a high-energy ignition system, generator, landing and taxi lamps, navigation lighting, and an <b>anti-collision</b> beacon. Pneumatic systems comprise a bleed air compressor, de-icing/de-misting measures, and {{elements of the}} environmental control system.|$|E
