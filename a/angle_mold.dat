Ingate <b>Angle,</b> <b>Mold</b> Temperature, and Pouring Temperature influence on the yield of products were studied by using response surface methodology. A 23 full factorial central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was employed. The relationship of Ingate <b>Angle,</b> <b>Mold</b> Temperature, Pouring Temperature, and yield of products was determined by using regression analysis. The models of expected function with quadratic model were used for analysis of the experimental data. The results indicated that the maximum predictive yield of products in alloy 1 by using optimal setting conditions of three controllable factors was 100 % and estimated optimum factors as follows: Ingate Angle= 37 ๐, Mold Temperature= 482 ๐C, and Pouring Temperature= 934 ๐C. The maximum predictive yield of products in alloy 2 by using optimal setting conditions of three controllable factors was 100 % and estimated optimum factors as follows: Ingate Angle= 35 ๐, Mold Temperature= 535 ๐C, and Pouring Temperature= 974 ๐C. The maximum predictive yield of products in alloy 3 by using optimal setting conditions of three controllable factors was 99. 72 % and estimated optimum factors as follows: Ingate Angle= 35 ๐, Mold Temperature= 514 ๐C...|$|E

Method. 47 subjects were evaluated by: (1) palpation and marking of the spinous processes using lead markers, (2) using X-rays in the sagittal plane to measure the Cobb <b>angles,</b> (3) <b>molding</b> the flexicurve to the spine, and (4) drawing the contour of the flexicurve onto graph paper. The angle of curvature was determined with the flexicurve based on a 3 rd order polynomial. Results. No {{differences were found between}} the Cobb angles and the angles obtained using the flexicurve in thoracic and lumbar curvatures (> 0. 05). Correlations were strong and significant for the thoracic (= 0. 72, < 0. 01) and lumbar (= 0. 60, < 0. 01) curvatures. Excellent and significant correlations were found for both the intraevaluator and interevaluator measurements. Conclusion. The results show that there is no significant difference between the values obtained using the flexicurve and those obtained using the X-ray procedure and that there is a strong correlation between the two methods. This, together with the excellent level of inter- and intraevaluator reproducibility justifies its recommendation for use in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Peroxidic perfluoropolyethers (PFPEs) are {{suitable}} tools for the covalent linkage of fluorinated groups on substrates containing aromatic moieties. Thus the thermal decomposition process of such fluorinated peroxides allowed the covalent linkage of PFPE radicals to the polycyclic aromatic {{structure of a}} graphitic carbon black. Contact <b>angle</b> measurements on <b>molded</b> pellets made with modified carbon black powders revealed a gradual enhancement of the hydrophobicity, which follows the increase of the fluorine content on the surface according to XPS experiments. BET analyses also revealed variations of the surface area of carbonaceous samples. Products and by-products were also evaluated by mass balances of decomposed portions of PFPE residues, respectively, PFPE chains bonded on carbon black and PFPE fluids obtained by homocoupling side-reactions. Modified carbonaceous materials were analyzed by solid state 19 F-MAS NMR {{and the results are}} in agreement with the proposed radical mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Several NASA {{technologies}} have played part in growth and cost containment of studio glass art, {{among them a}} foam type insulation developed to meet a need for lightweight material that would reduce flame spread in aircraft fire. Foam comes in several forms and is widely used by glass artists, chiefly as an insulator for {{the various types of}} ovens used in glass working. Another Spinoff is alumina crucibles to contain molten glass. Before alumina crucibles were used, glass tanks were made of firebrick which tended to erode under high temperatures and cause impurities; this not only improved quality but made the process more cost effective. One more NASA technology that found its way into glass art working is a material known as graphite board, a special form of graphite originally developed for rocket motor applications. This graphite is used to exact compound <b>angles</b> and creates <b>molds</b> for poured glass artworks of dramatic design...|$|R
40|$|Soft UV-imprint {{lithography}} at sub-micron dimensions {{was achieved}} in thin films of photopolymer resist. The imprinting was enabled by overcoming resist absorption by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) through surface treatment {{with a layer}} of (heptadecafluoro- 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrahydrodecyl) dimethylchlorosilane. Characterization of the composite molds was done by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, nanoindentation, and contact <b>angle</b> measurements. PDMS <b>molds</b> treated with fluoroalkylsilane layer were used to imprint into thin films (70 – 630 nm) of UV curable resins consisting of either polyurethanes or acrylates, replicating with high fidelity features over the surface of wafer substrates. The use of these highly conformal PDMS molds allowed the patterning of functional materials including gold and aluminium by a simple imprint lithographic technique. This is the first report of the use of modified PDMS surfaces in an imprint process that enables the transfer of sub-micron patterns to underlying layers for device structure fabrication. The patterned features were studied with atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and optical microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: Evaluation of {{fracture}} properties is a {{basic principle}} for true assessment of brittle materials’ properties. Resin–based composite materials are being used extensively in today’s dentistry. Fracture toughness is considered an important parameter for providing useful information about material’s nature, properties and its resistance to fracture. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the fracture toughness of a resin composite produced in the country and to compare it with that of other standard materials. Materials and Methods: Four types of resin composite materials were used as follow to prepare 60 specimens (n= 15 for each group), A) Tetric Ceram (Ivoclar–Vivadent); B) Brilliant (Coltene-Whaledent); C) SpectrumTPH (Dentsply); and D) Ideal Macoo (Ideal Macoo, Iran). Specimens of 5 mm diameter (&# 61617; 0. 1 mm) and 2 mm depth (± 0. 1 mm) were prepared in a central notch (90 &# 61616; notch <b>angle)</b> PTFE <b>mold.</b> Then specimens were light cured with two applications of overlapping exposures for a total of 120 s and were stored in distilled water at 37 &ordm;C for 48 hours, A cylindrical roller of 3 mm diameter was seated inside the V sections and fracture was accomplished in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Data were analyzed by one–way ANOVA and post-hoc paired Tukey HSD test with P 0. 05). Conclusion: From evaluating the fracture properties of materials tested in this study it was concluded that the mean fracture toughness value for SpectrumTPH (Dentsply) was significantly higher than that of Ideal Macoo resin composite material (Ideal Macoo, Iran). The F. T value for Ideal Macoo was considered acceptable as it was not significantly different from that of other resin composite materials tested...|$|R

We have several times alluded to the extreme richness and variety of hill foreground, as an internal energy to which there must be no contrast. Rawness of color is to be especially avoided, but so, also, is poverty of effect. It will, therefore, add much to {{the beauty of the}} building, if in any conspicuous and harsh <b>angle,</b> or shadowy <b>molding,</b> we introduce a wreath of carved leafwork,--in stone, of course. This sounds startling and expensive; but we are not thinking of expense: what ought to be, not what can be afforded, is the question. Besides, when all expense in shamming castles, building pinnacles, and all other fantasticisms {{has been shown to be}} injurious, that which otherwise would have been wasted in plaster battlements, to do harm, may surely be devoted to stone leafage, to do good. Now, if there be too much, or too conspicuous, ornament, it will destroy simplicity and humility, and everything which we have been endeavoring to get; therefore, the architect must be careful, and had better have immediate recourse to that natural beauty with which he is now endeavoring to assimilate.|$|R
30|$|Finally {{it should}} be noted that in most cases {{microfluidic}} designs are limited to planar, layer-by-layer geometries that are imposed by current lithography based techniques of microfabrication [20]. Using the 3 D molding process, 3 D patterns can be imprinted easily in a wide range of thermoplastic polymers used for low cost lab-on-a-chip applications and enclosed microfluidic devices with 3 D patterns can be formed via solvent-assisted bonding. The current 3 D molding process time is limited by curing of PDMS to form an intermediate stamp. However, the process time can be significantly used by using other UV curable polymers with similar cross-linking densities to have similar elastic properties since UV curing time is much shorter than thermal curing needed for PDMS. Various structures such as hierarchical micro and nanostructures with different geometries and dimensions can be patterned on the walls of microchannels and the cover plate enabling manipulating flow patterns. The direction of the patterns can also be controlled by setting different <b>angle</b> between brass <b>mold</b> protrusions and micropatterns on the surface of the thermoplastic polymer in the modified 3 D molding process. Such advantages make the 3 D molding process a suitable and powerful technique for fabricating micromixers.|$|R

It had a semi-monocoque fuselage, skinned with {{two layers of}} long plywood strips glued at opposing diagonal <b>angles</b> around a <b>mold</b> and skinned with fabric both inside and outside. The fuselage filled the full gap between the wings, leaving the pilot and observer/gunner over the top wings with an excellent view upward. The fuselage [...] "half-shells" [...] were each fitted onto a supporting framework of wooden formers and longerons. The [...] "wrapping" [...] technique of the long plywood strips for the outer fuselage surface led to this particular technique of manufacture being described in German as the Wickelrumpf (wrapped body) style of construction, and was subsequently patented by the firm, licensing the construction method to Pfalz in 1917 for construction of their own single-seat fighter designs. Although it {{was said to have}} tricky handling, the Roland C.II had excellent performance, and was also used on long-range missions as a bomber escort. A version with the 200 hp Benz Bz.IV engine and new wing struts was built as the D.III, but only one prototype was ever built, as was the case for the 160 hp Mercedes D.III-powered C.V.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Vacuum-assisted resin {{transfer}} molding (VARTM) processes are increasingly used in manufacturing scale-up composite applications. Accordingly, gravity can significantly influence the flow behavior in tall-structure composite man-ufacturing processes. The present study developed a closed-form analytic solution incorporating gravity effects with the equivalent parameter approach {{in order to}} predict the resin flow behavior in a tall structure resin infusion. A hybrid model was used that consists of thin distribution media and a fibrous preform. An analytic solution was developed and validated with experiments as well as numerical methods {{in terms of the}} resin flow front shape, lag length, and the flow front location with time for the horizontal, upward, and downward infusion cases. The flow front loca-tions were monitored using time domain reflectometry sensors embedded in the fabric layers. The lag length was constant in the horizontal infusion case, but decreased and increased in the upward and downward infusion cases, respectively, as resin progressed. The downward infusion case showed the fastest fill time, which corresponds to the previous results using a homogenous model. However, the flow became unstable at a certain location where the local flow front speeds increased suddenly along the distribution media. These phenomena were not observed in a model with homogenous media but were observed in a model with hybrid media, only in the downward infusion cases. The analytic solution also identified the stable flow conditions with the <b>mold</b> <b>angles.</b> The results obtained in the present study can be used to estimate stable process conditions in designing VARTM processes for manufacturing large-scale tall composite structures...|$|R
