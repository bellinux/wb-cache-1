500|$|Peter <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> write very quickly. It's {{usually a}} day or two a song, but for some reason this didn't really hit us as a hit song. We didn't give up on it. We just kept working on it {{over the course of a}} year. Thank God we did. [...] It was the first song that was cut on the True Blue album. It made me nervous as a writer, because a lot of times the very first song that gets cut doesn't make it in the long run. But the song ended up making the album, which really opened up a lot of doors for me.|$|E
2500|$|According to Packard, {{the core}} {{idea for the}} series emerged from bedtime stories that he told to his daughters, {{revolving}} around a character named Pete and his adventures. Packard stated, [...] "I had a character named Pete <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> had him encountering all these different adventures on an isolated island. But that night I {{was running out of}} things for Pete to do, so I just asked what they would do." [...] His two daughters came up with different paths for the story to take and Packard thought up an ending for each of the paths. [...] "What really struck me was the natural enthusiasm they had for the idea. And I thought: 'Could I write this down?'" ...|$|E

[...] "Calling the Center an 'anti-Israeli nest' and [...] Testone [...] and Mario Palumbo, the Center's board president, 'staunch anti-Zionists,' Lucas, {{in a series of}} emails, asked friends to stop donating to the Center and to contact elected officials to stop any government support." [...] "Asked ... to compare the response to his most recent boycott threat to [...] earlier one, Lucas wrote, 'This group has had their first and last meeting in the Center. If someone fucks with Israel, I fuck them back. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> win.'” ...|$|E

60|$|I {{got tired}} of inventing new answers to that {{question}}, and by <b>and</b> by <b>I</b> got horribly tired of the question itself. Whoever asked it became my enemy at once, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was <b>usually</b> almost eager to make that appear.|$|R

60|$|He {{came again}} and again to see me, always with a new roll of {{manuscript}} in his ulster.

60|$|For instance, {{for some}} years it had been my {{practice}} each winter to cruise for six or eight weeks on San Francisco Bay. My stout sloop yacht, the Spray, had a comfortable cabin and a coal stove. A Korean boy did the cooking, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> took a friend or so along to share the joys of the cruise. Also, I took my machine along and did my thousand words a day. On the particular trip I have in mind, Cloudesley and Toddy came along. This was Toddy's first trip. On previous trips Cloudesley had elected to drink beer; so I had kept the yacht supplied with beer and had drunk beer with him.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was much}} to allure a farmer {{boy in the}} decorum of well-dressed men and the grace of daintily clad {{women as well as}} in the music and the dim {{interior}} of the church (which seemed to me of great dignity and charm) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> went both morning and evening to watch the regal daughters of the county aristocracy go up the aisle. I even joined a Sunday school class because charming Miss Culver was the teacher. Outwardly a stocky, ungraceful youth, I was inwardly a bold squire of romance, needing only a steed and a shield to fight for my lady love. No one could be more essentially romantic than I was at this time--but fortunately no one knew it! ...|$|E

Train used to start at nine, and lag along round by Springfield, {{and get into the}} old Twenty-sixth Street Station here at six in the morning, where they let you sleep as long as you liked. They call you up now at half-past five, and, if you don't turn out, they haul you back to Mott Haven, or New Haven, I'm not sure which. I used to go into Boston and turn in at the old Worcester Depot, as we called it then, just about the time the train began to move, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> got a fine night's rest {{in the course of the}} nine or ten hours we were on the way to New York; it didn't seem quite the same after we began saying Albany Depot: {{shortened}} up the run, somehow.|$|E

60|$|September 1st.--Few things journalizable have {{happened}} during the last month, because Florence and the neighborhood have lost their novelty; <b>and</b> furthermore, <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> spend the whole day at home, having been engaged in planning and sketching out a romance.

5000|$|Computer {{programmer}} {{and author}} Fred Brooks makes an opposite statement regarding programming in The Mythical Man-Month: [...] "Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall {{continue to be}} mystified.

[...] The phrase has also been spoofed by computer scientist John McCarthy, to make the opposite point: [...] "As the Chinese say, 1001 words {{is worth more than}} a picture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When we halted for the night, Thompson <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> sawed out {{the blocks}} of compact snow, {{and carried them}} to Petersen, who acted as the master-mason in {{building}} the hut. The hour-and-a-half or two hours usually employed in erecting the edifice was the most disagreeable part of the day's labour; for, {{in addition to being}} already well tired and desiring repose, we became thoroughly chilled while standing about. The dogs were then fed, then the sledge unpacked, and everything carried into it. The door was now blocked up with snow, the cooking-lamp lighted, foot-gear changed, diary writing up, watches wound, sleeping-bags wriggled into, pipes lighted, and the merits of the various dogs discussed, until supper was ready; the supper swallowed, the upper robe or coverlet pulled over, and then to sleep. Next morning came breakfast, a struggle to get into frozen mocassins, after which the sledges were packed, and another day's march commenced. In these little huts we usually slept warm enough, although latterly, when our blankets and clothes became loaded with ice, we felt the cold severely. When our low doorway was carefully blocked up with snow, and the cooking-lamp alight, the temperature quickly rose, so that the walls became glazed and our bedding thawed; but the cooking over, or the doorway partially opened, it as quickly fell again, so {{that it was impossible to}} sleep, or even to hold one's pannikin of tea without putting mits on, so intense was the cold."--Sir L. McClintock is here speaking of a temperature of -39 degrees Fahr.|$|E
6000|$|... "One of {{the duties}} which fell to my share, {{during the period}} to [...] which I have referred, was the {{instruction}} of a class in [...] mathematics, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> found that Euclid and the ancient [...] geometry generally, when addressed to the understanding, formed a [...] very attractive study for youth. But it was my habitual practice to [...] withdraw the boys from the routine of the book, and to appeal to [...] their self-power {{in the treatment of}} questions not comprehended in [...] that routine. At first, the change from the beaten track usually [...] excited a little aversion: the youth felt like a child amid [...] strangers; but in no single instance have I found this aversion to [...] continue. When utterly disheartened, I have encouraged the boy by [...] that anecdote of Newton, where he attributes the difference between [...] him and other men, mainly to his own patience; or of Mirabeau, when [...] he ordered his servant, who had stated something to be impossible, [...] never to use that stupid word again. Thus cheered, he has returned [...] to his task with a smile, which perhaps had something of doubt in [...] it, but which, nevertheless, evinced a resolution to try again. I [...] have seen the boy's eye brighten, and at length, with a pleasure of [...] which the ecstasy of Archimedes was but a simple expansion, heard [...] him exclaim, 'I have it, sir.' The consciousness of self-power, [...] thus awakened, was of immense value; and animated by it, the [...] progress of the class was truly astonishing. It was often my custom [...] to give the boys their choice of pursuing their propositions in the [...] book, or of trying their strength at others not to be found there. [...] Never in a single instance have I known the book to be chosen. I [...] was ever ready to assist when I deemed help needful, but my offers [...] of assistance were habitually declined. The boys had tasted the [...] sweets of intellectual conquest and demanded victories of their [...] own. I have seen their diagrams scratched on the walls, cut into [...] the beams upon the play ground, and numberless other illustrations [...] of the living interest they took in the subject. For my own part, [...] as far as experience in teaching goes, I was a mere fledgling: I [...] knew nothing of the rules of pedagogics, as the Germans name it; [...] but I adhered to the spirit indicated at the commencement of this [...] discourse, and endeavoured to make geometry a means and not a [...] branch of education. The experiment was successful, and some of [...] the most delightful hours of my existence have been spent in [...] marking the vigorous and cheerful expansion of mental power, when [...] appealed to in the manner I have described." ...|$|E

60|$|These {{observations}} {{were taken by}} burying a brass tube two feet six inches to three feet deep, in exposed soil, and sinking in it, by a string or tied to a slip of wood, a thermometer whose bulb was well padded with wool: this, after a few hours' rest, indicates {{the temperature of the}} soil. Such a tube <b>and</b> thermometer <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> caused to be sunk wherever I halted, if even for one night, except {{during the height of the}} rains, which are so heavy that they communicate to the earth a temperature considerably above that of the air.|$|R

60|$|His mind ran rather {{upon his}} career, <b>and</b> <b>usually,</b> <b>I</b> {{am glad to}} recall, with a note of {{satisfaction}} and approval.
