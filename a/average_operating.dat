5|$|Hitler {{was finally}} {{convinced}} {{of the need to}} try every possible method to stop Bomber Command's night offensive over Germany. The operation was sanctioned by the OKL in November. Secrecy of the operation was paramount. The problem of preparing a large number of crews produced security fears which was recognised clearly. When crews of NJG 3 and NJG 2 were called to a briefing on Gisela, they were locked behind guarded doors. The crews were told that all available night fighters would participate in an all-out attack against Bomber Command over their airfields in England. The tactical deployment for the operation, they were told, was for two waves of night fighters to cross the coast in the region of Hull. To avoid enemy radar raiders were told to fly at minimum altitude and then climb to 4,500 metres as they reached the coast, generally believed to be the <b>average</b> <b>operating</b> height of British bombers. The Luftwaffe Western Front Intelligence Summary Service prepared dossiers for crews to study. It advised on the layout of British airfields and the lighting systems, such as the Drem system, along with funnel lights and angle of glide indicators. Crews were warned about RAF lighting codes on the control towers which warned RAF bomber crews of a possible intruder in the vicinity.|$|E

25|$|During 1970, Sud and Nord merged {{together}} to form Aerospatiale, who continued work on the SN 600. The company was keen to promote {{the advantages of the}} design, observing the SN 600 to offer well below <b>average</b> <b>operating</b> costs, being better within its size range than any other turbojet-powered competitor along with some turboprop-powered designs as well. Furthermore, it was promoted as being a spacious and flexible aircraft that satisfied the needs of commuter airlines. On 16 July 1970, the prototype SN 600, powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D engines installed, performed its maiden flight. However, the intended Larzac engine was never fitted to the prototype, having still been in development for over a year after the loss of the prototype, which had crashed during a test flight intended to explore the aircraft's stall characteristics on 23 March 1971. The loss of the prototype, while quickly resolved from a technical perspective, has been claimed to have badly shaken the faith of prospective customers in the type.|$|E

In 1998, the price at harvest of a [...] bushel was $2.68 per. Some information providers, following CBOT practice, quote the wheat market in per ton denomination. [...] A USDA report revealed that in 1998, <b>average</b> <b>operating</b> costs were $1.43 per bushel and total costs were $3.97 per bushel. In that study, farm wheat yields averaged 41.7 bushels per acre (2.2435 metric ton/hectare), and typical total wheat production value was $31,900 per farm, with total farm production value (including other crops) of $173,681 per farm, plus $17,402 in government payments. There were significant profitability differences between low- and high-cost farms, mainly due to crop yield differences, location, and farm size.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} examine empirically whether foreign banks on an <b>average</b> <b>operate</b> with greater {{efficiency}} and so attain {{higher levels of}} productivity and profitability. For this purpose, first, a stochastic frontier production function for the banking industry is estimated and bank-wise technical efficiency is computed. In the second stage, the authors compare the mean efficiency level of foreign banks with that of domestic banks. In addition, foreign and domestic banks are also compared {{with respect to the}} other measures of performance, namely, productivity and profitability. The result shows that the efficiency levels of group of foreign banks and domestic banks are not significantly different. The comparison of labour (or branch) productivity and profitability between domestic and foreign banks revealed that the same are respectively higher for the latter group. In wake of these findings, authors feel that the higher productivity and profitability of foreign banks are the consequences of their particular operational characteristics and strategies and preferential treatment rendered to them by the government of India. ...|$|R

40|$|Single-cell {{microfluidic}} analysis platforms {{are powerful}} {{tools in the}} characterization of rare phenotypes that exist as subpopulations and may be hidden by bulk <b>averages.</b> <b>Operating</b> at high throughputs and high concentrations is often necessary for processing large volumes required to isolate these rare populations and obtain statistical relevance. The current challenge of working at high concentrations lies in the inability of systems to perform relevant analysis or separation with high accuracy or purity when the interparticle spacing is reduced beyond the system response time, resulting in coincident events. This work proposes the use of structured channels to control interparticle spacing with an inertial microfluidics platform capable of operating at high throughputs (up to 10, 000 particles/sec), high concentrations (1 - 3 million particles/mL), and with heterogeneous cell populations (16 % cell size variation). Local expansion-contraction structures and extended chambers are used in series to induce secondary flows that promote repulsion between neighboring particles reliably (> 98 %) beyond a 40 -µm threshold. This use of passive methods to control spacing presents a more robust alternative to active methods such as squeezing sheath fluid or electric and magnetic field manipulation...|$|R
