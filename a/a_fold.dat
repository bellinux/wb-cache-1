5|$|The {{brooding}} anemone (Epiactis prolifera) is gynodioecious, starting life as {{a female}} and later becoming hermaphroditic, so that populations consist of females and hermaphrodites. As a female, the eggs can develop parthenogenetically into female offspring without fertilisation, and as a hermaphrodite, the eggs are routinely self-fertilised. The larvae emerge from the anemone's mouth and tumble down the column, lodging in <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> near the pedal disc. Here they develop and grow, remaining for about three months before crawling off to start independent lives.|$|E

5|$|These ore bodies {{formed in}} {{different}} places along a ring fault in the caldera. About 50 million years after they were deposited, the tectonic plate of which they were a part collided with another small plate {{and then with the}} proto-North American continent. The collisions, which welded the plates to the continent, folded the Cleopatra tuff {{in such a way that}} the two ore bodies ended up on opposite sides of <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> called the Jerome anticline.|$|E
30|$|<b>A</b> <b>folded</b> {{singularity}} {{is classified}} as <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> node if the eigenvalues are real and have the same sign, <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> saddle if the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, or <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> focus if the eigenvalues are complex [22, 23, 25, 29]. For parameter values used in Figure 2, the system has <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> node (with negative eigenvalues) on L+ (FN, blue point, in Figure 2), and <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> focus on L-(not shown).|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>fold</b> of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It was found that the cattle have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. Social standing depended on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother. Playfighting, licking and mounting were seen as friendly contact.|$|E
5|$|Beetles' flight {{wings are}} crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and stored below the elytra. <b>A</b> <b>fold</b> (jugum) of the {{membrane}} {{at the base}} of each wing is characteristic. Some beetles have lost the ability to fly. These include some ground beetles (Carabidae) and some true weevils (Curculionidae), as well as desert- and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few families, both the ability to fly and the elytra have been lost, as in the glow-worms (Phengodidae), where the females resemble larvae throughout their lives. The presence of elytra and wings does not always indicate that the beetle will fly. For example, the tansy beetle walks between habitats despite being physically capable of flight.|$|E
5|$|In the holotype of C. casuarius, {{the sides}} and tail of the body are covered in scales of several types. Polygonal tuberculate scales, covered in small bumps, vary in size over the body. Conical limpet-like scales are only {{preserved}} on <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> of skin preserved {{on the back of}} the tibia, but which was probably from the bottom of the belly, rather than the leg. Separating the polygonal scales of C. casuarius are shieldlike scales, arranged close together in rows. Ossified tendons are present on all the vertebrae, except for those in the cervical region. On no vertebrae do the tendons extend below the transverse processes. Each tendon is flattened at its origin, and transversely ovoid in the central rod, ending at a rounded point.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{structured}} biopolymers such as proteins, one {{can define}} topology of <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> RNA molecule. This is often done based on arrangement of intra-chain contacts within <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> RNA, termed as circuit topology.|$|R

We show how a compact manifold equipped with <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> symplectic structure {{can sometimes be}} broken apart, or “unfolded”, into honest compact symplectic orbifolds. <b>A</b> <b>folded</b> symplectic structure induces a spin-c structure which is canonical (up to homotopy).

5|$|The column or trunk is {{generally}} {{more or less}} cylindrical and may be plain and smooth or may bear specialist structures; these include solid papillae (fleshy protuberances), adhesive papillae, cinclides (slits) and small protruding vesicles. In some species the part immediately below the oral disc is constricted and {{is known as the}} capitulum. When the animal contracts, the oral disc, tentacles and capitulum fold inside the pharynx and are held in place by a strong sphincter muscle part way up the column. There may be <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> in the body wall, known as a parapet, at this point, and this parapet covers and protects the anemone when it is retracted.|$|E
5|$|The large pelvic fins {{originate}} {{beneath the}} disc and have convex trailing margins. Adult males have very short and thick claspers. The broad and flattened tail is {{shorter than the}} disc and bears <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> of skin along either side. There are two small dorsal fins, both with rounded to angular apices; the first is slightly smaller than the second, and its position varies from over to behind the pelvic fins. The caudal fin is triangular with rounded corners, and is roughly symmetrical above and below. The skin is soft and entirely devoid of dermal denticles.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the rhinarium {{does not have any}} {{olfactory}} receptors, so it is not used for smell in terms of detecting volatile substances. Instead, it has sensitive touch receptors (Merkel cells). The rhinarium, upper lip, and gums are tightly connected by <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> of mucous membrane called the philtrum, which runs from the tip of the nose to the mouth. The upper lip is constrained by this connection and has fewer nerves to control movement, which leaves it less mobile than the upper lips of simians. The philtrum creates a gap (diastema) between the roots of the first two upper incisors.|$|E

5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy. The {{back of the}} trachea may be damaged during tracheotomy. TBI resulting from tracheal intubation (insertion of a tube into the trachea) is rare, and the mechanism by which it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an endotracheal tube catching in <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> of membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through the airway. When an endotracheal tube tears the trachea, it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI that results from blunt trauma, most iatrogenic injuries to the airway involve longitudinal tears {{to the back of}} the trachea or tears on the side that pull the membranous part of the trachea away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from the cuff of an endotracheal tube can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the trachea, leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E
5|$|The leftmost division, {{advanced}} on La Haye Sainte. The farmhouse was {{defended by}} the King's German Legion. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out {{to either side}} and, {{with the support of}} several squadrons of cuirassiers, succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The Prince of Orange saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian Lüneberg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.|$|E
25|$|Finally, folds can have, but don't {{necessarily}} have <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> axis. <b>A</b> <b>fold</b> axis, “is the closest approximation to {{a straight line}} that when moved parallel to itself, generates {{the form of the}} fold.” (Davis and Reynolds, 1996 after Donath and Parker, 1964; Ramsay 1967). <b>A</b> <b>fold</b> that can be generated by <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> axis is called a cylindrical fold. This term has been broadened to include near-cylindrical folds. Often, the fold axis {{is the same as the}} hinge line.|$|E
