40|$|From {{the severe}} acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 to the Ebola epidemic of 2014 – 2015, {{one thing that}} always seems to go wrong in health emergencies is how national authorities communicate about it. In particular, how they communicate about the risk that the emergency poses to the people affected by it. Lessons learned and exercises conducted after these events almost always contain a recommendation along the lines of “We need to become better at risk communication”. The <b>Asia-Europe</b> <b>Foundation</b> (ASEF) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) collaborated and staged an emergency risk communication workshop on 7 – 8 September 2016. They convened this event in Stockholm, inviting 60 public health officials and experts from across the Asian and European regions. It was a diverse and multi-disciplinary group, some of whom were preparedness planners, others professional communicators and others responsible for public health training in their respective countries. The goal was to review best practice in the areas of emergency preparedness and risk communication in order to develop practical answers to the question, “How do you incorporate emergency risk communication into your public health preparedness plan?”. This is a report that outlines and expounds on their findings. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
