30|$|In this paper, {{we design}} <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for a mobile support robot that assists {{patients}} in their residential rooms. In general, the necessary life supports include physical operation assistance such as object location and handling, care tool/appliance adjustment, and utility condition controls. As stated above, {{most of these}} requirements may be met by robotic manipulators with multi-degrees of freedom, which are typically employed in industries [17]. On the other hand, because our proposed system provides minimum ADL supports to patients with slight disabilities, it mainly employs a single passive motor. Thus, the system can be sufficiently manufactured even by small/medium companies.|$|R

5000|$|Electric park brakes (EPB) {{are used}} on {{passenger}} vehicles {{to hold the}} vehicle stationary on grades and flat roads. This was accomplished traditionally using a manual parking brake. With electric park brakes, the driver activates the holding mechanism with a button and the brake pads are then electrically applied onto the rear brakes. This is accomplished by an electronic control unit (ECU) and an <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanism.</b> There are two mechanisms that are currently in production: 1. Cable puller systems and 2. Caliper integrated systems. [...] EPB systems {{can be considered a}} subset of Brake-by-wire technology.|$|E
50|$|For {{resonant}} scanners one often employed configuration is {{the indirect}} drive. In an indirect drive a small motion {{in a larger}} mass is coupled to a large motion in a smaller mass (the mirror) through mechanical amplification at a favorable mode shape. This {{is in contrast to}} the more common direct drive, where the <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanism</b> moves the mirror directly. Indirect drives have been implemented for electromagnetic, electrostatic, as well as piezo-electric actuators. There is no general answer to the question if the direct or indirect drive is more efficient, but judging by the performance of existing scanners the indirect drive appears to have the largest impact for piezo-electric scanners.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Virtual Prototyping with haptic {{feedback}} offers great {{benefits in the}} development process of actuated systems. We present a generic control scheme for the haptic rendering of actuated mechanisms, introducing the active admittance. It extends the conventional admittance control by modeling the actuation and the movable parts of the mechanism separately. This allows for an efficient iterative design and evaluation of an actuated mechanism and its single elements. The practicability of active admittance control is demonstrated by haptically rendering a car door with two actuated degrees-of-freedom.

30|$|For example, an {{in-plane}} omnidirectional {{mobile robot}} can locate at any {{position on a}} flat floor. When connecting the active and passive <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> the robot should be appropriately positioned for supporting the patient. Once the actuator pair is loosely connected by meshing, the active mechanism transfers its rotational motion to the passive one, increasing its connectivity to the mechanical tool or end effector. The simple tool or end effector might be a rotation-to-translation conversion mechanism, such as a pulley with a timing belt. Such tools are useful for curtaining and louvering of windows, or for realizing a simple gripper for object grasping. It {{should be noted that}} the robot and end-effector can be tightly connected through the passive latching mechanism. Driven by the rotating <b>actuator,</b> the latching <b>mechanism</b> on the end-effector can grip the robot housing. Having established a tight connection, the robot can trail simple objects across the floor.|$|R
5000|$|These {{were simple}} engines {{compared}} to modern engine design. However, they incorporate some very clever designs in several areas, many times because the designer {{was attempting to}} circumvent infringing a patent for a particular part of the engine. This is particularly true {{in the area of}} the governor. Governors are centrifugal, swinging arm, pivot arm, and many others. The <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanism</b> to govern speed is also varied depending on patents existing and the governor used. See, for example, U.S. Patents 543,157 from 1895 or 980,658 from 1911. However accomplished, the governor has one job - to control the speed of the engine. In modern engines, power output is controlled by throttling the flow of the air through the intake by means of a butterfly valve; the only exception to this being in diesels and Valvetronic petrol engines.|$|E

40|$|The <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{which is}} the bridge between the {{controller}} and the component, {{plays an important role}} in the nonlinear control system. The <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanism</b> fault has much effect on the whole nonlinear system performance. So the Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) of the <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanism</b> has been researched. But the <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanism</b> fault is always considered as the input type fault in the control system. Some unknown disturbances and uncertainties exist in the system input for the nonlinear system. It makes the designed observer insensitive to the initial state of slow variation fault for <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanism.</b> So, it is difficult to diagnose the incipient fault of the <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanism.</b> A method of the FDI for the <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanism</b> is proposed. The <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanism</b> which is often made up of more than one actuator, is analyzed as the dependent dynamic system and its fault is an output type fault. A batch of sliding mode observers is designed for each actuator of the <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The residuals of the designed observers tend to zero in the actuators fault-free condition. Once the faults exist in the actuators of the <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanism,</b> the residuals of the observers immediately varied. So, the number of the fault actuators can be diagnosed and the fault actuators are isolated. The results show that the proposed method is very effective for the FDI of the <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanism,</b> especially for the incipient state of gradual variation fault...|$|E

40|$|Blood pumps assist or {{take over}} the pump {{function}} of a failing heart. They are essentially activated by a pusher plate, a pneumatic compression of collapsible sacs or they are driven by centrifugal pumps. Blood pumps relying upon one of these <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanisms</b> do not account for realistic wall deformation. In this study, we propose an innovative design of a blood pump actuator device which {{should be able to}} mimic fairly well global left ventricular (LV) wall deformation patterns in terms of circumferential and longitudinal contraction, as well as torsion. In order to reproduce these basic wall deformation patterns in our actuator device, we designed a novel kind of artificial LV “muscle” composed of multiple actively contracting cells. Its contraction is based on a mechanism by which pressurized air, inside such a cell, causes contraction in one direction and expansion perpendicular to this direction. The organization and geometry of the contractile cells within one artificial LV muscle, the applied pressure in the cells, and the governing LV loading conditions (preload and afterload) together determine the global deformation of the LV wall. Starting from a simple plastic bag, an experimental model based on the abovementioned principle was built and connected to a lumped hydraulic model of the vascular system (including compliance and resistance). The wall deformation pattern of this device was validated visually and its pump performance was studied in terms of LV volume and pressure and heart rate. Our experimental results revealed (i) a global LV motion resembling a real LV, and (ii) a close correlation between our model and a real LV in terms of end-systolic volume and pressure, end-diastolic volume and pressure, stroke volume, ejection fraction and pressure-volume relationship. Our proposed model appears promising and it can be considered as a step forward when compared to currently applied <b>actuator</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> as it will likely result in more physiological intracavity blood flow patterns...|$|R
