25|$|Loweswater {{is unique}} amongst the major lakes of the District in {{emptying}} toward {{the centre of}} the National Park. Its waters flow out eastwards into Crummock Water before beginning their northward journey as the Cocker. Loweswater does not therefore represent any watershed between the fells on either side of its valley, as might be supposed from <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>glance</b> at the map. A low ridge circuiting the western end of the lake joins Burnbank Fell to Low Fell and Fellbarrow, confirming them as the last outpost of the Western Fells.|$|E
25|$|When one is {{learning}} another language, vocabulary presents difficulties. One must continuously search for unknown words, and consequently interest is lost. In the elementary part, however, this {{problem has been}} overcome, because the relevant translation of each word appears below the Volapük words. A selection of readings follows, and {{it is suggested that}} the Volapük words be read out loud. The grammar and a basic vocabulary have already been done in the introduction; nevertheless, <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>glance</b> at the translation is recommended to ensure that the overall meaning has been acquired. There is a maxim which states that a little study a day is better than a lot of study all at once.|$|E
25|$|The greasepaint {{mustache}} and eyebrows originated spontaneously {{prior to a}} vaudeville performance in the early 1920s {{when he did not}} have time to apply the pasted-on mustache he had been using (or, according to his autobiography, simply did not enjoy the removal of the mustache every night because of the effects of tearing an adhesive bandage off the same patch of skin every night). After applying the greasepaint mustache, <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>glance</b> in the mirror revealed his natural hair eyebrows were too undertoned and did not match the rest of his face, so Marx added the greasepaint to his eyebrows and headed for the stage. The absurdity of the greasepaint was never discussed on-screen, but in a famous scene in Duck Soup, where both Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) disguise themselves as Groucho, they are briefly seen applying the greasepaint, implicitly answering any question a viewer might have had about where he got his {{mustache and}} eyebrows.|$|E

2500|$|A rider posts to one [...] "diagonal" [...] or {{the other}} at the trot; when the rider is on the correct diagonal, the rider sits as the horse's inside hind leg and outside foreleg {{are on the ground}} and rises as the outside hind leg and inside foreleg are on the ground. [...] Diagonals are used in the posting trot help to keep the horse balanced, and are also useful for timing certain riding aids, such as those for the canter. A rider can learn to {{recognize}} diagonals by feel. However, less-experienced riders can check for the correct diagonal by <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>glance</b> at the horse's shoulder, sitting when the outside foreleg is on the ground and the shoulder is back.|$|E
