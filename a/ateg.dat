These results described an exhaust-based <b>ATEG</b> which integrated iron-based thermoelectric materials between a carbon steel hot-side heat exchanger and an aluminium cold-side heat exchanger. This <b>ATEG</b> could produce tens of watts out of a Porsche 944 exhaust system.|$|E

5000|$|An {{automotive}} {{thermoelectric generator}} (<b>ATEG)</b> is {{a device that}} converts some of the waste heat of an internal combustion engine (IC) into electricity using the Seebeck Effect. A typical <b>ATEG</b> consists of four main elements: A hot-side heat exchanger, a cold-side heat exchanger, thermoelectric materials, and a compression assembly system. ATEGs can convert waste heat from an engine's coolant or exhaust into electricity. By reclaiming this otherwise lost energy, ATEGs decrease fuel consumed by the electric generator load on the engine. However, {{the cost of the}} unit and the extra fuel consumed due to its weight must be also considered.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Hi-Z Inc {{designed}} an <b>ATEG</b> which could produce 1 kW from a diesel truck exhaust system. The {{company in the}} following years introduced other designs for diesel trucks as well as military vehicles ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{temperature}} {{difference between the}} two surfaces of the thermoelectric module(s) generates electricity using the Seebeck Effect. When hot exhaust from the engine passes through an exhaust <b>ATEG,</b> the charge carriers of the semiconductors within the generator diffuse from the hot-side heat exchanger to the cold-side exchanger. The build-up of charge carriers results in a net charge, producing an electrostatic potential while the heat transfer drives a current. With exhaust temperatures of 700°C (~1300°F) or more, the {{temperature difference}} between exhaust gas on the hot side and coolant on the cold side is several hundred degrees. This temperature difference is capable of generating 500-750 W of electricity.|$|E
5000|$|Like any new {{component}} on an automobile, {{the use of}} an <b>ATEG</b> presents new engineering {{problems to}} consider, as well. However, given an ATEG's relatively low impact on {{the use of an}} automobile, its challenges are not as considerable as other new automotive technologies. For instance, since exhaust has to flow through the ATEG’s heat exchanger, kinetic energy from the gas is lost, causing increased pumping losses. This is referred to as back pressure, which reduces the engine’s performance. This can be accounted for by down-sizing the muffler, resulting in net-zero or even negative total back-pressure on the engine, as Faurecia and other companies have shown.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper studies an <b>ATEG</b> {{system which}} {{works on the}} {{temperature}} difference between the exhaust gases (hot side) and circulating engine coolant liquid (cold side) of an Internal Combustion (IC) engine. The approach taken in this paper is theoretical analysis by understanding the basic physics (mathematical equations) of the <b>ATEG</b> system. These mathematical equations are modeled in MATLAB/Simulink environment for computer simulation. The inputs to this model, for simulation, are given from the IC engine test bench data. The {{results indicate that the}} <b>ATEG</b> system is suitable to drive all the electrical loads in a small (< 1. 4 liter engine) and midsized (between 1. 4 liter and 2 liter engine) IC engine driven Automobiles. Therefore, <b>ATEG</b> system forms a great candidate to replace the alternator for small and midsized Automobiles. Replacing the alternator by the <b>ATEG</b> eliminates the load of the alternator on the IC engine and increases the overall fuel efficiency of the automobile greatly (about 4 - 7 % depending on the IC engine and electrical demand of the car) ...|$|E
40|$|Increasing the {{combustion}} engine drive systems efficiency {{is currently being}} achieved by structural changes in internal combustion engines and its equipment, which are geared towards limiting mechanical, thermal and outlet losses. For this reason, downsizing. In addition to these changes, all manner of exhaust gas energy recovery systems are being investigated and implemented, including turbocompound, turbogenerators and thermoelectric generators. The article presents the author’s idea of a thermoelectric generator system of automotive applications <b>ATEG</b> (Automotive Thermoelectric Generator) {{and the study of}} the recovery of exhaust gas energy stream. The <b>ATEG</b> consists of a heat exchanger, thermoelectric modules and a cooling system. In this solution, 24 commercial thermoelectric modules based on Bi 2 Te 3 (bismuth telluride) were used. Measurements were made at two engine test sites on which SI and CI engines were installed. The exhaust gas parameters (temperature and mass flow rate), fuel consumption and operating parameters of the <b>ATEG</b> – the intensity and the voltage generated by the thermoelectric modules and the temperature {{on the walls of the}} heat exchanger – were all measured in the experiments. Based on the obtained results, the exhaust gas energy flow and the power of the <b>ATEG</b> were determined as well as its effect on the diesel engine drive system efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Fructo-oligosaccharides are {{prebiotic}} and hypocaloric sweeteners {{that are}} usually extracted from chicory. They can also be produced from sucrose using fructosyltransferases, but the only commercial enzyme suitable for this purpose is Pectinex Ultra, which is produced with Aspergillus aculeatus. Here we used the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis to express a secreted recombinant fructosyltransferase from the inulin-producing fungus Aspergillus terreus. A synthetic codon-optimised version of the putative beta-fructofuranosidase <b>ATEG</b> 04996 (XP 001214174. 1) from A. terreus NIH 2624 was secreted as a functional protein into the extracellular medium. At 60 degrees C, the purified A. terreus enzyme generated {{the same pattern of}} oligosaccharides as Pectinex Ultra, but at lower temperatures it also produced oligomers with up to seven units. We achieved activities of up to 986. 4 U/mL in high-level expression experiments, which is better than previous reports of optimised Aspergillus spp. fermentations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{feasibility}} report presents {{results in}} the thermal energy recovery systems (TERS) investigation, {{and the possibility of}} introducing them to production vehicles as subsystems. This prospective new technology should reduce dependence on fossil fuels. One of the TERS systems’ research objectives is to create a sustainable, electrical power source, suitable for the energy to be stored and later used in the electrical vehicle driving mode (EV) 1. It will also lower the impact on the environment by reducing fuel consumption through the application of automotive thermoelectric generators (<b>ATEG)</b> instead of classical alternators that convert mechanical energy to electrical. Instead of using part of the useful mechanical power, i. e. energy, we will be using wasted heat energy emitted in the environment. Investigation was carried out comprehensively by performing technical analysis, covering a wide variety of hybrid vehicles and systems. Finally, as an outcome, this report presents possible novel solutions to create sustainable hybrid vehicles with TERS systems...|$|E
