500|$|Kate McCann's {{appearance}} and demeanour were widely discussed, {{with much of}} the commentary coming from other women, including Booker Prize-winner Anne Enright in the London Review of Books. Kate was deemed cold and controlled, too attractive, too thin, too well-dressed, too intense. She had apparently been advised by abduction experts not to cry on camera because the kidnapper might enjoy her distress, and this led to more criticism: the Portuguese tabloid Correio da Manhã cited sources complaining that she had not [...] "shed a single tear". Journalism professor Nicola Goc argued that Kate had joined a long list of mothers deemed killers because of unacceptable maternal behaviour. Commentators compared her experience to that of Lindy Chamberlain, convicted of murder after her baby was killed by a dingo. Like Kate, she was suspected, in part, because she did not weep in public. There was even a similar (false) story about supposedly relevant Bible passages the women were said to have highlighted. Chamberlain asked: [...] "How can you apologise to me <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> again to someone else?" ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{according}} to contemporary English reports, Thomas Howard marched on foot leading the English vanguard {{to the foot}} of the hill. Howard was moved to dismount <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> by taunts of cowardice sent by James IV's heralds, apparently based on his role at sea and the death two years earlier of the Scottish naval officer Sir Andrew Barton. A version of Howard's declaration to James IV that he would lead the vanguard and take no prisoners was included in later English chronicle accounts of the battle. Howard claims his presence in [...] "proper person" [...] at the front is his trial by combat for Barton's death.|$|E

2500|$|As {{in other}} famous crimes, {{including}} {{the case of}} Jack the Ripper, the police dealt with numerous false confessions.
