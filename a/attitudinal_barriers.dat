There are {{two major}} ethnic groups in Guatemala—Ladinos, who are persons of mixed European and Indigenous {{heritage}} and Indigenous, {{most of whom are}} of Mayan descent and speak one of the 22 Mayan languages. Discrimination against Indigenous people, although prohibited by law, is evident in economic, educational, and health care domains (Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo Humano, PNUD 2005). For example, 80  % of Indigenous people in Guatemala live in poverty or extreme poverty, compared to 45  % of non-Indigenous people. In addition, Ladinos and Indigenous tend to hold mutually negative attitudes, with a majority of each group claiming that people of the other ethnicity are less agreeable, less intelligent, and less honest than members of their own group (PNUD 2005).|$|R

30|$|Intercountry adoptions from Guatemala {{were highly}} controversial, {{because of the}} large numbers of {{children}} being adopted to the USA, along with evidence of corruption and child theft. Since the implementation of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption in 2008, Guatemala’s central authority for adoption has prioritized domestic placements for children over intercountry adoption. A possible <b>attitudinal</b> <b>barrier</b> to domestic adoption in Guatemala—negative attitudes and prejudice against Indigenous people—was investigated through questionnaires measuring attitudes toward adoption and attitudes toward and social distance from the two major ethnic groups (Ladino and Indigenous). Guatemalan university students (N =  177, 61  % men) were recruited from basic required courses at a private university. Results showed that attitudes toward adoption in general were more favorable than toward interethnic adoption, with the most negative attitudes toward adoption of Ladino children by Indigenous parents. Multiple regression and analysis of covariance models revealed that female gender, experience with adoption and more positive attitudes about Indigenous persons were associated with more positive attitudes toward adoption. The findings imply that negative attitudes toward Indigenous persons are associated with negative attitudes toward adoption, and serve as barriers to promoting domestic adoption in Guatemala.|$|R

40|$|Special Education Needs (SEN) {{students}} who have difficulties in learning have traditionally been marginalized within or even excluded from the school libraries. To explore the practices of the school library media service provision and programmes conducted for SEN students in the mainstream schools and understand conditions that may facilitate or deter the provision of an inclusive school library in a Malaysian setting, a total of 24 participants comprising special educators, teacher librarians and students with disabilities were interviewed. The study found that although examples of good practice of school library services and programmes were found, there is need for improvement in service delivery to SEN students. Much of this could be achieved by enhanced communication and cooperation between teacher librarians and special educators. The analysis suggests six barriers {{in the provision of}} inclusive school libraries: physical, resources, curriculum, policy, unintentional and intentional <b>attitudinal</b> <b>barrier.</b> The paper concludes with a consideration of possible strategies for improvements in provision of inclusive school libraries.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Construction Management)) [...] Cape Penninsula University of Technology, 2005 The {{construction}} industry {{contributes to the}} economy {{in terms of its}} labour intensive nature and status as a major employer of labour in many countries. This pivotal role is divided by its unappealing status ofbeing an industrial sector with the lowest level of employment of disabled persons. Despite the South African government's efforts to diversifY the industry's labour force, these have had little concrete effect on changing the demographics of construction especially relative to the representation of minority groups such as women and disabled persons. The industry presents both a challenging and hostile environment and <b>attitudinal</b> <b>barrier</b> for persons with disabilities. They have not been seen as part of the pool of people considered for employment, and when already employed, possible promotion. To change this negative image, conscious measures are necessary to remove barriers. These measures should include a change in leadership style and approach, fundamental change in culture, change in the negative image of the working environment, and full implementation of equal opportunity policies. This paper reports on the employment status of disabled persons within the {{construction industry}}. To achieve this, the qualitative methodology was adopted and included surveys, self-administered questionnaires and interviews as well as the quantitative methodology to validate the completeness of dat...|$|R
50|$|In the Independent Living philosophy, {{people with}} disabilities are {{primarily}} seen as citizens and only secondarily as consumers of healthcare, rehabilitation or social services. As citizens in democratic societies, the IL Movement claims, persons with disabilities have the same right to participation, to the same range of options, degree of freedom, control and self-determination in everyday life and life projects that other citizens take for granted. Thus, IL activists demand the removal of infrastructural, institutional and <b>attitudinal</b> <b>barriers</b> and {{the adoption of the}} Universal Design principle. Depending on the individual’s disability, support services such as assistive technology, income supplements or personal assistance are seen as necessary to achieve equal opportunities. As emphasized by the IL Movement, needs assessment and service delivery must enable users to control their services, to freely choose among competing service providers and to live with dignity in the community. Cash benefits or Direct Payments are favored by IL activists over services in kind in terms of the outcomes for users’ quality of life and cost-efficiency.|$|E
40|$|Framework to {{evaluate}} a model examining associations between clinical trial knowledge, <b>attitudinal</b> <b>barriers</b> to participating in clinical trials, clinical trial self-efficacy, and clinical trial preparedness among 1256 cancer pa-tients seen for their first outpatient consultation at a can-cer center. As an exploratory aim, moderator effects for gender, race/ethnicity, education, and metastatic status on associations in the model were evaluated. Methods. Patients completed measures of cancer clinical trial knowledge, <b>attitudinal</b> <b>barriers,</b> self-efficacy, and pre-paredness. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was con-ducted {{to evaluate}} whether self-efficacy mediated the association between knowledge and barriers with pre-paredness. Results.

40|$|Structural and <b>attitudinal</b> <b>barriers</b> prevent many {{individuals}} from accessing professional {{mental health services}} and often times lead to the premature termination of treatment. Although research {{findings suggest that the}} integration of mental health services in primary care can increase access to services and reduce stigma for typically underserved populations, dropout occurs at high rates. The current study aims to: (1) identify correlates of attitudinal and structural barriers in a primary care setting, and (2) test the ability of the Integrated Model of Seeking Help (IMoSH) to predict follow-up for behavioral health visits. In particular, it was hypothesized that <b>attitudinal</b> <b>barriers</b> would predict behavioral intentions to return to a recommended appointment. On the other hand, structural barriers would better predict dropout for patients who had greater intentions of returning to their behavioral health appointment. Participants (N = 100) were recruited from two primary care clinics. During their initial contact with behavioral health services, patients rated their perceptions of attitudinal and structural barriers to treatment continuation, perceived need, and intention to return for a follow-up appointment. Electronic medical records indicated that 50 % of patients attended their recommended follow-up appointment. Correlational analyses did not identify any significant correlates of <b>attitudinal</b> <b>barriers.</b> However, Spanish language preference was related to the endorsement of more structural barriers. Findings from a path analysis testing the IMoSH’s ability to predict follow-up demonstrated that neither <b>attitudinal</b> <b>barriers</b> or structural barriers predicted behavioral intentions or follow-up, and structural barriers did not moderate the relation between behavioral intentions and follow-up attendance. Post hoc analyses revealed that a model including perceived need was able to predict follow-up attendance. The preliminary results of this study can help mental health service providers identify where efforts should be placed during patients’ first visits in order to increase treatment engagement and improve continuity of care...|$|E

The production of rice husk is steady and increasing in trend in Bangladesh. This biomass energy is playing {{a significant role in the}} country energy use. This study was conducted to focus on the improvement of rice husk energy and constraints for technologies dissemination in Bangladesh. The performances of the rice husk energy technologies were studied. The benefits of the use of rice husk energy technologies were analyzed and the constraints to its dissemination were found out during this study. The main consumer of the rice husk energy is the rice milling sector. About 70 % of rice husk energy is consumed by the rice parboiling system. The wastes of rice husk energy can be reduced by replacing the improved system and CO level in flue gas can be reduced as well. The surplus rice husk is converted to rice husk briquette fuel which is used for cooking in small restaurant and poor household sector. The solid fuel is used as an alternative of wood fuel. The rice husk briquetting could generate employment and play a great role to reduce the CO 2 reduction. Several constraints were identified for the dissemination of rice husk energy technologies viz. policy and regulation; official recognition, <b>attitudinal</b> <b>barrier,</b> loan facility, ownership, raw material availability etc...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether the viewing of a personal photoaged photograph had the capacity to alter Western Australian teenagers 2 ̆ 7 pro-tanning attitudes. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with fifteen teenagers. Findings: The teenagers 2 ̆ 7 pro-tanning attitudes prior to viewing their photoaged photograph are encapsulated in the study 2 ̆ 7 s central theme: 2 ̆ 7 You 2 ̆ 7 ve got to look after your skin and use sunscreen, but I always forget! 2 ̆ 7. Post-viewing their photoaged facial image many teenagers reiterated their intentions to adopt (when they remembered) skin-protective measures. However, photoaged photography did not alter other teenagers 2 ̆ 7 intention to tan. New knowledge: Teenagers who choose to continue to tan were aware of the long-term health risks associated with ultra-violet over-exposure. However, their desire remained strong to emulate the media promoted image of bronzed youth being popular individuals. Indeed, the social benefits of being considered attractive to their peers became an <b>attitudinal</b> <b>barrier</b> to the teenagers 2 ̆ 7 adoption of skin-protective behaviours. Those teenagers who changed their pro-tanning attitudes following their viewing of their ultra-violet photoaged photograph did so because of the shock they received when they saw their sun-damaged facial image. This suggests that photoageing photography can be effective with many adolescents because it reduces the cause-and-effect delay that exists between the occurrence of sun-damage and its visual presentation in later-life. Conclusion: Greater effort needs to be focused on increasing teenagers 2 ̆ 7 understanding of how sun-damage occurs, when it is appropriate to apply sunscreen, as well as in changing the prevailing media image of an attractive body being a tanned body. © 2016 by De Gruyter...|$|R
