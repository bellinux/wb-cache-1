40|$|The {{preservation}} of rare {{and endangered species}} of birds requires finding efficient, and above all successful, methods of breeding them in captivity. One strategy adopted is to remove eggs from the mother, making her lay more eggs, and then incubating the removed eggs artificially. Artificial incubation machines must attempt to replicate the conditions of natural incubation as closely as possible. Aside from careful control of temperature and humidity within the <b>artificial</b> <b>incubator,</b> an important factor to reproduce is that eggs must be turned about their long axis from time to time. Hatching will not occur in an egg that is not subjected {{to some form of}} occasional rotation. The reason why eggs are turned {{and the way in which}} they should be turned are still not well understood. The Study Group attempted to gain some insight into why eggs have to be turned from a fluid dynamic perspective. A simple egg-turning model for an egg at the first stages of incubation was constructed, based on lubrication theory...|$|E
40|$|Procaine {{hydrochloride}} 0. 1 mg {{was added}} to the fresh serum 1 ml of a surgical patient. After it was kept in an <b>artificial</b> <b>incubator</b> (37 °C) for 30 minutes exactly, the amount of non-hydrolyzed procain in it was determined by the method described above. The 1 ml of normal human serum perfectly hydrolyzed 0. 1 mg. of procaine hydrochloride in 30 minutes. On the other hand it was recognized that the activity of serum procaine-esterase decreased in some cases of stomach cancer, gastric ulcer, cholecystitis, splenomegaly and so forth. The amount of non-hydrolyzed procaine in these diseases was less than 0. 03 mg. But it is not always proper to say that the lowering of its activity in serum 1 ml suggests that of the total serum procaine-esterase activity of the same individual. On observing the relationship between hematocrit value and the activity of procaine esterase, the degree of anemia was more or less proportional to the activity of procaine-esterase in serum 1 ml. Furthermore investigating the total volume of circulating blood-plasma at the same time, we obtained the results as follows in the cases of gastric cancer patients, in which the activity of procaineesterase decreased markedly, the plasma volume often increased more than that in normal man. Therefore, in the view-point of the esterase activities of the total circulating plasma volumes, there was little difference between these patients and normal individuals. On the other hand, observing the relation between the amount of serum protein and the activity of procaine-esterase, it was suggested that the more the former decreased, the lower the latter often became, but the both were not always parallel, and also that the lowering of the latter might be related to the derease of albumin content...|$|E
40|$|Four new {{loggerhead turtle}} nest sites were {{discovered}} in July 2006 and July 2008 on Italian beaches in the regions of Puglia, Sardinia, and Campania. Previously, no nesting has been reported on those beaches. All nests were protected by a fence and a surveillance team and nest temperatures were monitored throughout the incubation period. The 2006 nests experienced low incubation temperatures, which lead to long incubation conditions {{and two of the}} nests had to be rescued and transferred into an <b>artificial</b> <b>incubator.</b> Both nests failed to hatch after > 100 days of incubation, but for different reasons: in Puglia the entire clutch (47 eggs) contained only eggs with yolk, and hence, if the eggs were fertilized then embryonic death occurred early and could not be determined; in Sardinia all but two of the embryos (clutch size 92) developed until the pre-pipping stage but did not hatch, probably {{due to a lack of}} gas-exchange caused by a disrupted chorioallantoic membrane. The Campania nest in 2006 (93 eggs) hatched with a low success (33. 3 %) after a prolonged incubation period (72 days) and also contained many undeveloped eggs (60 %). In 2008 instead, another nest in Campania incubated at very high temperatures (mean 33. 2 °C) and hatched after 46 days with a 92. 2 % success (clutch size was 115 eggs). The four nests reported here occurred contemporaneously with other nine unusual loggerhead turtle nesting events in the Western Mediterranean over the last decade. The possibility that turtles with relaxed philopatry explore new nest sites is discussed, but since no historical data on nesting in this region are available, organised monitoring of potential new nest sites is required to evaluate this behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The Pesquet´s parrot (Psittrichas fulgidus) is an endemic bird of New Guinea, {{where it}} inhabits {{mountain}} rainforests. This color featureless parrot with bare head {{is a very}} specialized frugivore feeding especially figs.

The aim of this thesis was to describe the breeding of this species in captivity and to determine the success existing rearing in selected breeding institution. Breeding of Pesquet´s parrot had been described in the Loro Parque in Tenerife, in Jurong BirdPark in Singapore, in San Diego Zoo in the U.

40|$|Avian {{incubation}} {{is influenced}} by three basic factors: temperature, humidity, and egg rotation. The incubation temperature can significantly affect {{the development of an}} individual before hatching as well as after it. In natural conditions the incubation temperature is maintained by a parent trying to stabilize it at the developmental optimum. The parents must also provide their own needs during incubation, which results in temperature fluctuations. Although the incubation temperature is species-specific, its mean varies between 30 řC and 40 řC across all avian taxa. Lower temperatures but still within the optimum range cause reduced hatchability and prolongation of incubation period. Higher temperatures within the optimum range shorten incubation period and also reduce hatchability. Incubation temperature affects also the weight of an individual, its body proportions, metabolism, survival after hatching, and possibly also reproduction success (fitness). A detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which temperature affects the embryo development and its features is necessary, among others, to optimize incubation methods in <b>artificial</b> <b>incubators.</b> Key words: incubation, temperature, reintroduction, egg, avian embryo, hatchability, incubation lengt...|$|R
50|$|The modern Centro Mexicano de la Tortuga (Mexican National Turtle Center) {{was founded}} by the federal {{government}} in 1991 after the sea turtle trade was completely banned in the country. The Centro Mexicano de la Tortuga is an aquarium and research center dedicated to turtles, especially sea turtles. The installation covers four hectares located in Mazunte right next to the beach, near where the sea turtle slaughterhouse used to be. The Center contains specimens of all marine turtles native to Mexico as well as six species of fresh water and two species of land turtles also found in the country. It contains tanks and other habitats in which a variety of turtle species can be seen. The buildings on the site are designed to be similar to those around it, both traditional and modern. Outdoor tanks hold turtle species of different ages and include both natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>incubators</b> for turtle eggs. The installation also contains a multipurpose room, gift shop and a cactus garden. Research objectives include developing techniques to manage, increase and preserve the turtle species of the country as well as promoting knowledge and ecological tourism based on turtles. This facility receives 60,000 visitors a year.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A simple {{model to}} {{describe}} the relation-ship between {{the temperature of the}} developing em-bryo, incubator temperature, embryo heat production, and thermal conductivity of the egg and surrounding air is presented. During early incubation, embryo tempera-ture is slightly lower than incubator temperature because of evaporative cooling. However, from mid-incubation onwards, metabolic heat production from the embryo raises embryo temperature above incubator temperature. The extent of the rise in embryo tempera-ture depends on thermal conductivity, which, in turn, is mainly influenced by the air speed over the egg. The importance of air speed and restrictions to air flow within <b>artificial</b> <b>incubators</b> is discussed. Exact determinations of optimum incubation temper-atures from studies reported in the literature are difficult because only incubator temperatures are reported. Embryo temperatures can differ from incubator temper-ature because of differences in thermal conductivity between different incubation systems and differences between incubators in their ability to control tempera-tures uniformly. It is suggested that shell surface temperatures are monitored in experiments to inves-tigate temperature effects to allow consistent compari-sons between trials. Monitoring shell temperatures would also make it easier to translate optimum temperatures derived in small experimental incubators to the large commercial incubators used by the poultry industry. The relationship between egg temperature, the metabolism of the developing embryo and egg size is discussed...|$|R
40|$|As female {{birds are}} able to lay {{no more than a}} single egg each day, in those species {{producing}} larger clutches the first laid eggs may get a developmental head-start over later eggs in the clutch. All other things being equal, the differential pattern of development across the clutch may contribute to hatching asynchrony and subsequent inequity in the competition between brood mates, and ultimately increase variance in the quality and fitness of first- and last-laid offspring. It has been suggested that females might allocate resources differently across the laying sequence to moderate the developmental rate and hatching time of different embryos. We tested this theory in the Zebra Finch Taeniopygia guttata, a common model species for investigating maternal effects in birds. We removed 758 eggs from 160 nests shortly after they were laid and used <b>artificial</b> <b>incubators</b> to control for parental effects and monitor hatching times. Eggs from larger clutches consistently hatched sooner than those from average-sized clutches, demonstrating that the intrinsic properties of an egg can alter the developmental time of embryos. There were also differences in the development time of eggs across the laying sequence, but these patterns were weaker, inconsistent and unrelated to sequential investment across the laying sequence in a straightforward way. This study indicates that maternal resource allocation to eggs across the laying sequence and across clutch sizes can influence development times and play a potentially important role in determining the competitive dynamics of broods. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The breeding, egg laying, incubation, chick {{survival}} {{and growth of}} emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) were studied in a farmed population. Eggs were laid every 3 - 5 days between May to October with a peak in July. Birds laid in vegetation, or where absent, near fence lines or by artificial shelters. Clutch size was highly variable (range: 2 - 45) between individuals, and between seasons, and variability increased with {{the age of the}} hen. The fate of 578 artificially incubated eggs were recorded. Fertility levels were high (90 %) but hatching success was lower. Embryonic mortality was greatest during the first trimester with a second smaller peak at the end of incubation. 434 chicks hatched, representing 68 % of all eggs set and 83 % of fertile eggs. Weight loss for the entire incubation period was 12. 5 % and was not correlated with embryo mortality. X-ray and ultrasound equipment were unsuccessful in determining egg fertility. Natural incubation was studied in two emu nests. Egg temperatures averaging 34. 1 °C and 31. 7 °C were lower and more variable than those used in <b>artificial</b> <b>incubators.</b> Eggs hatched after 51 - 54 days. In one nest, deserted eggs cooled to 12. 2 °C hatched when incubated artificially. Rates of egg turning varied, and two thirds of all egg turns were 90 ° or less, and only 12 % were turned between 158. 5 ° - 202. 5 °. Water loss during incubation was 10 % of the initial egg weight and was greatest at the end of incubation. Males lost up to 30 % of body weight during incubation. Survival, sex ratios and growth rates were determined for emu chicks hatching from 637 artificially incubated New Zealand eggs, and 105 eggs imported from Canada for incubation under class 1 quarantine conditions. Survival rates to three months were high (88 %). Mortality due to hatch-related problems was restricted to the first week of rearing, and to weeks 8 - 12 when bone deformities became evident. Sex ratios were 50 : 50. The chicks lost weight after hatching but thereafter grew exponentially. There {{was no significant difference between}} male and female hatch weights, or rates of growth, but females grew faster and were heavier up to 18 months. Most birds that grew significantly slower from three weeks of age died within three months. The genetic identity and development of twin emu was described.

40|$|During {{the last}} few decades, global climate change {{has been one of}} the major drivers of species extinction, and has altered many {{ecological}} interactions. Monarch butterflies, which represent a cultural icon in North America, have been experiencing population declines due to several anthropogenic forces associated with environmental change. In addition, a monarch protozoan neogregarine parasite, Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE), aggravates their situation by decreasing the reproductive success and longevity of adult butterflies. Previous studies have shown that global warming can modify the interaction between parasites and their hosts. This study aimed to assess how a rise in temperature affects the virulence and transmission potential of OE. I hypothesized that an increase in temperature would result in shorter adult life spans and higher parasite loads. A total of 154 larvae were reared on <b>artificial</b> diet in <b>incubators</b> at three temperatures, 22 °C, 25 °C and 28 °C until adult emergence or premature death. Approximately 30 larvae from each temperature were inoculated with 10 OE spores and 20 larvae were un-inoculated controls. Developmental time, pupal weight and spore loads were measured and data were analyzed using generalized linear models. Unexpected co-infection with an unknown pathogen resulted in high larval mortality in both OE-inoculated and control treatments, preventing an independent assessment of the effect of temperature on the monarch-OE interaction. As a result of co-infection, monarchs inoculated with OE were more likely to die during the larval stage. As expected, the total developmental time of butterflies declined at higher temperatures. Importantly, only 8 out of 42 OE-inoculated larvae that survived to adulthood produced OE spores, suggesting an antagonistic interaction between the unknown pathogen and OE. Overall, higher temperatures appeared to have a largely positive effect on monarch performance, since butterflies reared at warmer temperatures had shorter developmental times, resulting in a decrease in exposure time to the unknown pathogen. In conclusion, the unknown pathogen interacted in complex ways with OE, affecting monarch performance more than the increase in temperature itself. In this changing world, temperature sensitive host-parasite interactions could potentially be altered by global warming. However, they need to be studied within the context of how multiple pathogens will interact with their hosts under elevated temperature scenarios...|$|R
