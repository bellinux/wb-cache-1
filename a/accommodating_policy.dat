We model an economy composed {{of a large number of}} interacting price-setting firms, where interactions stem from consumers' uncertainty on prices posted by different firms. The underlying Markovian structure possesses a stationary distribution with multiple modes, so that its associated dynamics may be characterized by multiple regimes and sudden transitions among them.

Concerning external factors, monetary policy in Germany affects significantly both US and Japanese interest rates; Germany, on the other hand, is rather responsive to developments in continental Europe, in spite of its 'dominance' of the EMS. As for domestic influences, inflationary expectations are an important factor in explaining interest rate behaviour in Japan, and the budget deficit plays a role in the US.

It aims to answer the question why did the United States choose an aggressive policy towards the new Cuban regime, what were the results of their strategy, whether a more accommodating attitude would have potentially represented a better solution, and whether considering the circumstances the U. S. could have adopted such an attitude. It analyzes individual events and aspects of this period, led by the Bay of Pigs invasion, in order to find out how much influence did the United States have on Fidel Castro's turn to Communism and the Soviet Union, and whether they were partly responsible for triggering the Cuban missile crisis. The author comes {{to the conclusion that the}} American foreign policy towards Cuba between 1959 and 1963 was ill-chosen, because it was not only unable to obtain its main goal of overthrowing Fidel Castro, but also forced the Cuban regime to radicalise and closely cooperate with the Soviet Union.

40|$|Background: Three {{arguments}} are usually invoked {{in favour of}} stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trials: the logistic convenience of implementing an intervention in phases, the ethical benefit of providing the intervention to all clusters, and the potential to enhance the social acceptability of cluster randomised controlled trials. Are these alleged benefits real? We explored the logistic, ethical, and political dimensions of stepped wedge trials using case studies of six recent evaluations. Methods: We identified completed or ongoing stepped wedge evaluations using two systematic reviews. We then purposively selected six {{with a focus on}} public health in high, middle, and low-income settings. We interviewed their authors about the logistic, ethical, and social issues faced by their teams. Two authors reviewed interview transcripts, identified emerging issues through qualitative thematic analysis, reflected upon them {{in the context of the}} literature, and invited all participants to co-author the manuscript. Results: Our analysis raises three main points. First, the phased implementation of interventions can alleviate problems linked to simultaneous roll-out, but also brings new challenges. Issues to consider include the feasibility of organising intervention activities according to a randomised sequence, estimating time lags in implementation and effects, and <b>accommodating</b> <b>policy</b> changes during the trial period. Second, stepped wedge trials, like parallel cluster trials, require equipoise: without it, randomising participants to a control condition, even for a short time, remains problematic. In stepped wedge trials, equipoise is likely to lie in the degree of effect, effectiveness in a specific operational milieu, and the balance of benefit and harm, including the social value of better evaluation. Third, the strongest arguments for a stepped wedge design are logistic and political rather than ethical. The design is advantageous when simultaneous roll-out is impractical and when it increases the acceptability of using counterfactuals. Conclusions: The logistic convenience of phased implementation is context-dependent, and may be vitiated by the additional requirements of phasing. The potential for stepped wedge trials to enhance the social acceptability of cluster randomised trials is real, but their ethical legitimacy still rests on demonstrating equipoise and its configuration for each research question and setting...|$|E

40|$|Since Friedman (1953) an {{advantage}} often attributed to {{flexible exchange rate}} regimes relative to fixed regimes is their ability to better insulate the economy against real shocks. I use a post-Bretton Woods sample (1973 - 1996) of 74 developing countries to assess whether the response of real GDP, real exchange rates and prices to terms of trade shocks differ systematically across exchange rate regimes. I find that real GDP and the real exchange rate responses are significantly different across regimes. In response to a negative terms of trade shock, fixed regimes experience large and significant losses in real GDP growth and the real exchange rate depreciates only after two years. Flexible regimes, on the other hand, are associated with small growth losses and immediate large real depreciations. Negative shocks are inflationary in floats and deflationary in pegs. In the second chapter I document the large dispersion in price levels that exists between different exchange rate regimes. In low and medium income countries, price levels in floats are, respectively, 30 percent and 24 percent smaller than in pegs. A simple application of a stochastic open economy model with nominal rigidities suggests a possible explanation for this fact. (cont.) Uncertainty and {{the behavior of the}} monetary authority can affect the wage setting behavior of private agents. Under a peg, agents require a wage premium relative to floats, to be compensated for the higher variability in employment. This, in turn, implies a higher consumption based price level. However, an endogenous choice of the exchange rate regime and a less than fully <b>accommodating</b> <b>policy</b> in floats can potentially undo this result. Finally, the third chapter provides a simple dynamic framework to study the relation between the banking sector's safety nets and the share of foreign currency (dollar) deposits. When deposit and bank insurance schemes that do not discriminate between currencies they introduce a cross-transfer from local currency (peso) to dollar deposits that favors deposit dollarization and results in an increased currency exposure of banks. Second, the presence of a lender of last resort, by reducing the cost of risk to banks, stimulates dollar financing. by Christian M. Broda. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Our {{relationship}} with rain is complicated. It is imperative for life, yet it wrecks havoc {{on many of}} our urban areas. Increased development translates to increased impervious surfaces within cities, resulting in flood damage to property, nearby stream channel erosion, high pollutant loads carried to waterways, and significant damage to aquatic ecosystems. The impacts of rainfall from as small as 1 -year and 5 -year storm events is magnified due to our development practices and traditional stormwater management infrastructure. Directing huge volumes of runoff {{as quickly as possible}} into aging and deteriorating gray infrastructure (culverts, pipes, tunnels, and tanks) is no longer adequate. Green Infrastructure and Low Impact Development embody a new attitude toward managing runoff. Ironically, the fundamental principles are ancient: allow rain to naturally infiltrate the ground where is falls. Green Infrastructure (GI) : “An interconnected network of undisturbed natural areas and open space that helps preserve the values and functions of our watersheds and provides a wide array of benefits to both people and wildlife” (Benedict & McMahon, 2006). Low Impact Development (LID) : “a comprehensive land planning and engineering design approach with a goal of maintaining and enhancing the pre-development hydrologic regime of urban and developing watersheds” (Low Impact Development Center Inc., 2011). Stormwater management in its most basic terms is simply the way we ease the impacts of our land development processes. For the most part, the primary focus has been on mitigating increased runoff velocity and quantity once a site has undergone disturbance through a change in land use. A shift to preventing negative impacts, rather than mitigating them, is beginning to take precedent using GI and LID measures as preferred stormwater management techniques. However, development incorporating GI and LID remains marginal in most U. S. cities due to conflicting and unsupportive regulatory requirements at all levels of government. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive account of federal, state and local policies encouraging and/or obstructing GI and LID adoption for stormwater management in most urban areas.

40|$|The recent {{literature}} {{focuses on}} achieving macro-economic stability by an active {{use of the}} monetary policy instruments. The present study focuses on identifying monetary policy shocks and traces their impact on Pakistanâ€™s economy. To this end, nonlinear policy rules {{have been used to}} be able to use monthly data on monetary variables. We have used the standard SVAR and STAR approaches that are popular in making basic OLS estimation and the simulations in a new-Keynesian type closed economy model. We state identification conditions to reveal the dynamic effects of monetary policy shocks on the non-policy block of variables. For nonlinear analysis we have pursued a general-tospecific methodology whereby, by imposing straight restrictions on the general model, to find the model that is statistically sound and fits the data the best. A threshold regression model comprising three monetary regimes is used for analytical purposes. An important finding of the present study is that a higher-than-normal increase in money supply has had the expected effect of stoking the fires of unusual inflationary episodes. The policy response has been to curb inflation by using different monetary policy instruments namely, manipulation of the key interest rate and changes in the total reserve requirements of the banking system to restrain the inflationary tendencies. The empirical results confirm remarkable differences in the monetary policy transmission mechanism during the three sample periods. We conclude that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) can exercise an effective control on inflation and adjust output growth forecasts in the middle of the three threshold periods identified in this study. We also find that when inflation forecasts are within a moderate range, around the long-run inflation target, the SBP tends to assume an essentially <b>accommodating</b> <b>policy</b> stance with respect to the manipulation of the key interest rate. In general, the monetary authority relies on encouraging demand and supply shocks to restore inflation to its desired long-run level. On the contrary, when inflation forecast tends to fall outside the tolerance range (which according to resent study is 4. 13 to 11. 21), aggressive adjustments in the interest rate can take place. An important implication of our analysis is that only a small proportion of the observed repetitive variation is attributable to random variation in monetary policy and the real effects of monetary policy are smaller than is usually believed. Pakistanâ€™s experience with monetary policy supports the existence of the so-called Price Puzzle namely, that a positive shock to interest rate tends to increase the price level instead of reducing it Yet another finding of the present study is that inflation variability around the central projection can be contained by increasing short run nominal interest rates. The policy implication of this finding is that, with asymmetric output-inflation trade off, a vigilant policymaker would keep the average interest rate higher than the symmetric specification. One more interesting aspect of our analysis is that interest rate based policy has been much more sensitive to exogenous shocks in the period after 1999 - 2000. The policy responses of the SBP during this period have been asymmetric. Under this policy framework the SBP responds not only to current or lagged inflation; it keeps in view expected inflation as well. Another implication is that the monetary authority should extend its objective function to include not only price stability but also output stabilization...|$|E
