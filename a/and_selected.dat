40|$|In {{the recent}} years, the Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) {{products}} are being increasingly {{used in the}} world of software development. Therefore, evaluating <b>and</b> <b>selecting</b> appropriate COTS product {{is one of the most}} critical activities in COTS-based system development. Unfortunately, many methods that have been proposed in previous studies for evaluating <b>and</b> <b>selecting</b> COTS software are still have many limitations and lack to apply and accept as a formal method in the industry. So without an effective method for evaluating <b>and</b> <b>selecting</b> COTS products, the time spent on selecting the suitable COTS software may offset the advantages of using it. This paper outlines and discusses the common problems in existing methods and presents the main processes and evaluation criteria (nonfunctional requirements) that are required for evaluating <b>and</b> <b>selecting</b> COTS software through theoretical and empirical studies which goal is to develop new framework to evaluate <b>and</b> <b>select</b> COTS software...|$|R

30|$|The task of OSS-LMS {{evaluation}} and selection is often assigned under schedule pressure, and evaluators {{may not have}} time or experience to plan the {{evaluation and}} selection in detail. Therefore, evaluators may not use the most appropriate framework for evaluating <b>and</b> <b>selecting</b> OSS-LMS packages (Jadhav and Sonar 2011). Evaluating <b>and</b> <b>selecting</b> an OSS-LMS package that meets the specific requirements of an organization are complicated and time-consuming decision-making processes (Jadhav and Sonar 2009 a, b). Therefore, researchers have been investigating an improved means of evaluating <b>and</b> <b>selecting</b> OSS-LMS packages.|$|R

5|$|After 2008, Detroit's {{front office}} and {{coaching}} personnel were essentially overhauled {{by the team}} ownership. Matt Millen, the team's incumbent general manager and CEO since 2001, was terminated on September 28, 2008. His replacement, Martin Mayhew, ultimately terminated head coach Rod Marinelli in the off-season. Marinelli was replaced by Jim Schwartz, then defensive coordinator of the Tennessee Titans. Schwartz ultimately revamped the entire Detroit offensive (and defensive) philosophieshiring Scott Linehan and Gunther Cunningham, respectively. Detroit held the first pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, <b>and</b> <b>selected</b> quarterback Matthew Stafford out of the University of Georgia. Stafford was named the team's starting quarterback out of training camp, but he battled various injuries throughout the season. Much of the 2008 Detroit roster was released by the new regime, and the 2009 team was viewed as somewhat of a work-in-progress, but Johnson still finished the 2009 season with 67 receptions, 984 yards, and five touchdowns, while missing two games.|$|E
