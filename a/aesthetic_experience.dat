25|$|He {{says that}} Dewey {{was wrong to}} treat his {{definition}} of art as experience as a traditionalist wrapper definition, thus making it vulnerable to the valid charges, that it is both too narrow and too wide (there are some artworks which do not engender aesthetic experiences and, conversely, in some cases <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experience</b> accompanies phenomena which simply cannot be redefined as art, like natural beauty, e.g.). He further says that what Dewey should have done instead was to assign to it the directional and transformational role mentioned above. Conceived this way, Shusterman argues, the definition of art as experience has an undeniable value because even though it cannot embrace the whole extension {{of the concept of}} art it “underlines a crucial background condition, direction, and valued goal of art” (i.e. <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experience)</b> and also helps to widen “the realm of art by challenging the rigid division between art and action that is supported by definitions that define art as mimesis, poiesis, or the narrow practice defined by the institutional art world".|$|E
25|$|Shusterman {{advocates a}} {{definition}} of art; as experience that is influenced by Dewey’s definition with significant changes. While he accepts {{the majority of the}} elements central to the Dewey’s conception of this experience (e.g., that it cannot be reduced to the private mental world of the subject being rather an interaction between the subject and the object), there are some he finds questionable (e.g. Dewey’s insistence on the unity and coherence of <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experience</b> which Shusterman would like to supplement with aesthetics of rupture and fragmentation).|$|E

40|$|Whereas {{negative}} feelings sometimes increase preference for mood-incongruent <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experiences</b> (e. g., cheerful music, comedy), they also sometimes increase preference for mood-congruent ones (e. g., sorrowful music, drama). In this paper, we address {{the causes of}} this apparent discrepancy. We hypothesize that (1) mood-congruent <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experiences</b> offer a sense of bonding and emotional sharing, akin to interacting with an empathetic friend and thus (2) they are preferred when individuals are deprived {{of a sense of}} bonding from dissolving interpersonal relationships. Consistent with our hypotheses, three experiments show that {{negative feelings}} from broken interpersonal bonds increase preferences for mood-congruent <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experiences,</b> whereas negative feelings from non-interpersonal problems increase mood-incongruent preferences.

40|$|<b>Aesthetic</b> <b>experiences</b> of artworks are {{influenced}} by contextualizing information such as titles. However, how titles contribute to positive <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experiences</b> is still an open issue. Considering that fluency, as well as effortful elaborate processing, potentially influence <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experiences,</b> we tested how three different title types—semantically matching (fluent), semantically non-matching (non-fluent), and an untitled condition (control) —affected experiences of abstract, semi-abstract, and representational art. While participants viewed title/artwork combinations we assessed facial electromygraphic (fEMG) recordings over M. corrugator supercilii and M. zygomaticus major muscle to capture subtle changes in emotional and cognitive processing, and asked for subjective liking and interest. Matching titles, but also the more effortful untitled condition, produced higher liking compared to non-fluently processed, non-matching titles especially in abstract art. These results were reflected in fEMG with stronger M. corrugator activations in the non-matching condition followed by the untitled condition. This implies high cognitive effort as well as negative emotions. Only in the matching condition, M. zygomaticus was more strongly activated indicating positive emotions due to fluency. Interest, however, was hardly affected. These results show that high levels of dis-fluency and cognitive effort reduce liking. However, fluency as well as moderate levels of effort contribute to more positive <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experiences...</b>|$|R

He also spent evenings with delight in London's theatrical world, an <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experience</b> that would prove, somewhat later, of seminal importance to his mature critical work. In large part, however, Hazlitt was then living a decidedly contemplative existence, one somewhat frustrated by his failure to express on paper the thoughts and feelings that were churning within him. It was at this juncture that Hazlitt met Samuel Taylor Coleridge. This encounter, a life-changing event, was subsequently to exercise a profound influence on his writing career that, in retrospect, Hazlitt regarded as greater than any other.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} {{the identification of}} creative criteria to support the development of innovative systems. In idea generation, criteria that characterise creative ideas are: fluency, variety, innovativeness and usefulness. Creative criteria have been defined at a very generic level, and we have found very little indication of how in particular, the concept of innovativeness is operationalised. Trying to refine creative criteria in a specific domain however is very pertinent. Practically, it facilitates idea generation by allowing the selection, combination and elaboration of ideas that possess relevant characteristics. We explore thus creativity as innovativeness through a case study, the cybercartography project. The results of idea-generation sessions for this project provided insights into the definition of creative ideas. To refine the concept of innovativeness, {{we turn to the}} theory of <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experiences</b> {{based on the work of}} Dewey. Properties of <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experiences</b> are discussed in relation with the cybercartography project. The examination of <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experiences</b> led to the definition of innovativeness attributes as affect and dynamic inquiry...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} theory {{of the nature of}} <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experiences</b> on the basis of {{a theory of}} aesthetic values. It results in the formulation of the following necessary conditions for an experience to be aesthetic: (i) it must consist of a (complex) representation of an object and an accompanying feeling; (ii) the representation must instantiate an intrinsic value; and (iii) the feeling must be the recognition of that value and bestow it on the object. Since representations are of intrinsic value for different reasons, there are different kinds of <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experiences</b> (such as sensual or meta-cognitive ones). By means of certain conceptual links, it is possible to extend this account to other aesthetic entities thus enabling the formulation of a general theory of the aesthetic in non-aesthetic terms. In particular, aesthetic values are identical with subjective dispositions to elicit <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experiences</b> under normal conditions. Accordingly, I endorse anti-realism about aesthetic values: their existence, nature and exemplification are mind-dependent, while their ascriptions to objects have genuine truth-values. I back up this account by arguing against the alternative positions that either take aesthetic values to be objective or deny the truth-aptness of their attributions. Furthermore, I put forward a relativist variant of anti-realism according to which ascriptions of different (and seemingly incompatible) aesthetic values to a particular object are all correct, given that the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experiences</b> involved are made under normal conditions and concern the same aesthetically nonevaluative features of that object. For there is no specifically aesthetic norm (e. g., a specification of “ideal critics”) by means of which one of the faultless <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experiences</b> can be picked out as the only appropriate one. That aesthetic values nevertheless show a normative dimension is ensured by their conformity to a general account of values as capacities to satisfy, or dissatisfy, rational desires...|$|R

500|$|Fantasia {{garnered}} significant {{critical acclaim}} {{at the time}} of release and was seen by some critics as a masterpiece. The West Coast premiere at the Carthay Circle Theatre was a grand affair, attracting some 5000 people, including Shirley Temple, Cecil B. DeMille, Forrest Tucker, James Cagney, Robert Montgomery, James Murphy, Edgar Bergen, [...] and many other notables in the film industry. Among those at the film's premiere was film critic Edwin Schallert of the Los Angeles Times who considered the film to be a magnificent achievement in film which would go down in film history as a landmark film, noting the rapturous applause the film received by the audience during the various interludes. He stated that Fantasia was [...] "caviar to the general, ambrosia and nectar for the intelligentsia" [...] and considered the film to be [...] "courageous beyond belief". Music critic of the newspaper, Isabel Morse Jones, was highly praising of the soundtrack to the film, believing it to be a [...] "dream of a symphony concert", an [...] "enormously varied concert of pictorial ideas, of abstract music by acknowledged composers, of performers Leopold Stokowski and orchestra players of Hollywood and Philadelphia, and, for the vast majority, new and wonderful sound effects". Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, also at the premiere, noted that [...] "motion-picture history was made last night... Fantasia dumps conventional formulas overboard and reveals the scope of films for imaginative excursion... Fantasia... is simply terrific." [...] Peyton Boswell, an editor at Art Digest, called it [...] "an <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experience</b> never to be forgotten". Time magazine described the premiere as [...] "stranger and more wonderful than any of Hollywood's" [...] and the experience of Fantasound [...] "as if the hearer {{were in the midst of}} the music. As the music sweeps to a climax, it froths over the proscenium arch, boils into the rear of the theatre, all but prances up and down the aisles." [...] Dance Magazine devoted its lead story to the film, saying that [...] "the most extraordinary thing about Fantasia is, to a dancer or balletomane, not the miraculous musical recording, the range of color, or the fountainous integrity of the Disney collaborators, but quite simply the perfection of its dancing". Variety also hailed Fantasia, calling it [...] "a successful experiment to lift the relationship from the plane of popular, mass entertainment to the higher strata of appeal to lovers of classical music". The Chicago Tribune assigned three writers to cover the film's Chicago premiere: society columnist Harriet Pribble; film critic Mae Tinee; and music critic Edward Barry. Pribble left amazed at the [...] "brilliantly-attired audience", while Tinee felt the film was [...] "beautiful... but it is also bewildering. It is stupendous. It is colossal. It is an overwhelmingly ambitious orgy of color, sound, and imagination." [...] Barry was pleased with the [...] "program of good music well performed... and beautifully recorded" [...] and felt [...] "pleasantly distracted" [...] from the music to what was shown on the screen. In a breakdown of reviews from both film and music critics, Disney author Paul Anderson found 33% to be [...] "very positive", 22% both [...] "positive" [...] and [...] "positive and negative", and 11% negative.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{many other}} {{aesthetic}} theories, Schopenhauer's {{centers on the}} concept of genius. Genius, according to Schopenhauer, is possessed by all people in varying degrees and consists of the capacity for <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experience.</b> An <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experience</b> occurs when an individual perceives an object and understands by it not the individual object itself, but the Platonic form of the object. The individual is then able to lose himself in the object of contemplation and, for a brief moment, escape the cycle of unfulfilled desire by becoming [...] "the pure subject of will-less knowing". Those who have a high degree of genius can be taught to communicate these aesthetic experiences to others, and objects that communicate these experiences are works of art. Based on this theory, Schopenhauer viewed Dutch still-life as the best type of painting, because it was able to help viewers see beauty in ordinary, everyday objects. However, he sharply criticized depictions of nude women and prepared food, as these stimulate desire and thus hinder the viewer from the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>experience</b> and becoming [...] "the pure subject of will-less knowing".|$|E
