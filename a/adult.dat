40|$|In {{spite of}} {{evidence}} for increased maintenance and/or improvement of emotional experience in older adulthood, past work suggests that young <b>adults</b> are better able than older <b>adults</b> to identify emotions in others. Typical emotion recognition tasks employ a single-closed-response methodology. Because older <b>adults</b> are more complex in their emotional experience than young <b>adults,</b> they may approach such response-limited emotion recognition tasks in a qualitatively different manner than young <b>adults.</b> The first study of the present research investigated whether older <b>adults</b> {{were more likely than}} young <b>adults</b> to interpret emotional expressions (facial task) and emotional situations (lexical task) as representing a mix of different discrete emotions. In the lexical task, older <b>adults</b> benefited more than young <b>adults</b> from the opportunity to provide more than one response. In the facial task, however, there was a cross-over interaction such that older <b>adults</b> benefited more than young <b>adults</b> for anger recognition, whereas young <b>adults</b> benefited more than older <b>adults</b> for disgust recognition. A second study investigated whether older <b>adults</b> benefit more than young <b>adults</b> from contextual cues. The addition of contextual information improved the performance of older <b>adults</b> more than that of young <b>adults.</b> Age differences in anger recognition, however, persisted across all conditions. Overall, {{these findings are consistent with}} an age-related increase in the perception of mixed emotions in lexical information.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how associative and inductive reasoning processes develop over trials in feature positive (FP) and feature negative (FN) discrimination learning.

The measure of discrimination learning was the number of trials it took participants to articulate the exact rule. In the initial task, older <b>adults</b> articulated the rule more slowly than younger <b>adults</b> in FP discrimination and took marginally more trials to articulate the rule in FN discrimination than younger <b>adults.</b> Age differences were greater in FP discrimination than in FN discrimination learning because younger <b>adults</b> performed well in FP discrimination learning.

Older <b>adults</b> articulated the FN rule slower than older <b>adults.</b> The differences in trials to articulate the FN rule for the two groups were somewhat larger for inconsistent transfer than consistent transfer. Discrimination learning was explained in terms of associative and inductive reasoning processes reasonably well. The measure of associative processes was forgotten responses, whereas the measures of inductive reasoning processes were irrelevant cue shifts and perseverations. In FP discrimination learning in the initial task, older <b>adults</b> had a greater proportion of forgotten responses, irrelevant cue shifts, and marginally more perseverations than younger <b>adults.</b> Therefore, older <b>adults</b> had more difficulty with associative and inductive reasoning processes than younger <b>adults</b> in FP discrimination.
