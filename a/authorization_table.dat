We argue that three major principles are missing from the proposed mechanism: hierarchies of purposes, delegation of tasks and authorizations (i. e. outsourcing), and the minimal disclosure of private information. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework for the negotiation of personal information among customers and (possibly virtual) enterprises based on user preferences when enterprises may adopt different processes to provide the same service. We use a goal-oriented approach to analyze the purposes of a Hippocratic system and derive a purpose and delegation hierarchy. Based on this hierarchy, effective algorithms are given to determine the minimum set of authorizations needed for a service. In this way, the minimal <b>authorization</b> <b>table</b> of a global business process can be automatically constructed {{from the collection of}} privacy policy tables associated with the collaborating enterprises. By using effective online algorithms, the derivation of such minimal information can also be done on-the-fly by the customer wishing to use the services of a virtual organization. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} three aspects (i. e., role-based access control, role-based {{delegation}} and privacy-aware access control) {{of developing a}} systematic methodology for information sharing in distributed collaborative environments. We develop techniques for setting up secure group communication and providing accesses to group members for many database systems, which incorporate new security constrains and policies raised by current information technologies. We create new forms of access control models to identify and address issues of sharing information in collaborative environments and to specify and enforce privacy protection rules to support identified issues. In role based access control systems (RBAC) permissions are associated with roles, and users are made members of appropriate roles thereby acquiring the roles’ permissions. This greatly simplifies management of permissions. Roles are created for various job functions in an organization and users are assigned roles based on their responsibilities and qualifications. Users can be easily reassigned from one role to another. Roles can be granted new permissions as new applications and systems are incorporated, and permissions can be revoked from roles as needed. The principal motivation of RBAC is to simplify administration. In large organizations the number of roles {{can be in the}} hundreds or thousands, and users can be in the tens or hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions. Effective management of permission-role assignment could be very useful in practice to avoid the security breach, especially when conflicting permissions granted to the same role. Constraints are an important aspect of RBAC and are a powerful mechanism for laying out higher level organizational policy. Even for the usage control (UCON) model, constraints are discussed less and no formal language is proposed to describe constraints precisely. An appealing is to study constraints formally in RBAC and UCON models. Our work looks at proposing formal approaches to check conflicts and help allocate permissions without compromising security in RBAC and proposing a formal language to specify constraints for system designers and administrators in UCON models. Delegation requirement arises when a user needs to act on another’s behalf to access resources. Essentially, in a multi-agent system, delegation becomes the primary mechanism of inter-agent collaboration and cooperation. However, the previous delegation model could not work efficiently in large systems and perform the sensitive delegation task within the broad area of security. In this thesis, we introduce a flexible ability-based delegation model within RBAC. Moreover, to avoid risk during the delegation process, we propose a secure multi-level delegation model, where a projection between the reliability of delegatees and the sensitivity of delegated tasks is built. Our multi-level delegation model allows that a delegatee in a higher trust level can be assigned with a higher level task. With the widespread use of information technology, privacy protection becomes a major concern and it could not be easily achieved by traditional access control models. In this thesis, we propose a privacy-aware access control model with generalization boundaries, which could maximize data usability while, minimizing disclosure of privacy. Moreover, our privacy-aware access control model provides a much finer level of control. Although Hippocratic database enforced the fine-grained disclosure policy through creating a privacy <b>authorization</b> <b>table,</b> but it does not allow to distinguish which particular method is used for fulfilling a service in a real world case. We use a goal-oriented approach to analyze privacy policies of the enterprises involved in a business process, in which one can determine the minimum disclosure of data for fulfilling the root purpose with respect to customer’s maximum trust. We provide efficient algorithms to automatically derive the optimal way of authorizations needed to achieve a service from enterprise privacy policies. ...|$|E

40|$|Today, many {{applications}} require users from one organization to access data belonging to another organizations. While traditional solutions offered for the federated and mediated databases facilitate this by sharing metadata, {{this may not}} be acceptable for certain organizations due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel solution – Privacy-preserving Access Control Toolkit (PACT) – that enables privacy-preserving secure semantic access control and allows sharing of data among heterogeneous databases without having to share metadata. PACT uses encrypted ontologies, encrypted ontology-mapping tables and conversion functions, encrypted role hierarchies and encrypted queries. The encrypted results of queries are sent directly from the responding system to the requesting system, bypassing the mediator to further improve the security of the system. PACT provides semantic access control using ontologies and semantically expanded <b>authorization</b> <b>tables</b> at the mediator. One of the distinguishing features of the PACT is that it requires very little changes to underlying databases. Despite using encrypted queries and encrypted mediation, we demonstrate that PACT provides acceptable performance. 1...|$|R

40|$|Appendix H, Section H. 3. 3. 10. 11 of the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR), {{provides}} {{the limits to}} be observed for fueled components authorized for storage in the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) spent fuel storage system. Currently, the authorization basis allows standard driver fuel assemblies (DFA), {{as described in the}} FSAR Chapter 17, Section 17. 5. 3. 1, to be stored provided decay power per assembly is {le} 250 watts, post-irradiation time is four years minimum, average assembly burn-up is 150, 000 MWD/MTHM maximum and the pre-irradiation enrichment is 29. 3 % maximum (per H. 3. 3. 10. 11). In addition, driver evaluation (DE), core characterizer assemblies (CCA), and run-to-cladding-breach (RTCB) assemblies are included based on their similarities to a standard DFA. Ident- 69 pin containers with fuel pins from these DFAs can also be stored. Section H. 3. 3. 10. 11 states that fuel types outside the specification criteria above will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. There are many different types of fuel and blanket experiments that were irradiated in the FFTF which now require offload to the spent fuel storage system. Two reviews were completed for a portion of these special type fuel components to determine if placement into the Core Component Container (CCC) /Interim Storage Cask (ISC) would require any special considerations or changes to the authorization basis. Project mission priorities coupled with availability of resources and analysts prevented these evaluations from being completed as a single effort. Areas of review have included radiological accident release consequences, radiological shielding adequacy, criticality safety, thermal limits, confinement, and stress. The results of these reviews are available in WHC-SD-FF-RPT- 005, Rev. 0 and 1, ''Review of FFTF Fuel Experiments for Storage at ISA'', (Reference I), which subsequently allowed a large portion of these components {{to be included in the}} <b>authorization</b> basis (<b>Table</b> H. 3. 3 - 21). The report also identified additional components and actions in Section 3. 0 and Table 3 that require further evaluation. The purpose of this report is to evaluate another portion of the remaining inventory (i. e., delayed neutron signal fuel, blanket assemblies, highly enriched assemblies, newly loaded Ident- 69 pin containers, and returned fuel) to ensure it can be safely off loaded to the FFTF spent fuel storage system...|$|R
