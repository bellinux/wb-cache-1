5|$|In 2006, the Livestock Conservancy began {{investigating}} the Carolina Marsh Tacky {{to see if}} it was truly a descendant of colonial Spanish stock, and during the organization's initial field investigations it was found that many surviving members of the breed fit the physical type for Spanish horses. In 2007, the organization partnered with the Equus Survival Trust in a project to preserve the breed that included DNA sampling, the creation of a new studbook and mapping the genetics of the breed. The Conservancy participated in the rescue of the Wilbur Cruce strain of Colonial Spanish horse when the area in which it lived was to be turned over to a land conservation program that required domestic animals to be removed. After the rescue, <b>a</b> <b>conservation</b> plan was developed for the animals and small breeding groups of horses were placed with responsible parties. It also assisted in formulating <b>a</b> <b>conservation</b> and breeding strategy for a strain of Colonial Spanish horses from Santa Cruz Island in California. This support helped the horses to become recognized and registrable with the Colonial Spanish registry.|$|E
