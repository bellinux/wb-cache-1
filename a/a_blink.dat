5|$|Traditionally, devices like <b>a</b> <b>blink</b> {{comparator}} {{were used}} in astronomy to detect objects in the Solar System, because these objects would move between two exposures—this involved time-consuming steps like exposing and developing photographic plates or films, and people then using <b>a</b> <b>blink</b> comparator to manually detect prospective objects. During the 1980s, the use of CCD-based cameras in telescopes {{made it possible to}} directly produce electronic images that could then be readily digitized and transferred to digital images. Because the CCD captured more light than film (about 90% versus 10% of incoming light) and the blinking could now be done at an adjustable computer screen, the surveys allowed for higher throughput. A flood of new discoveries was the result: over a thousand trans-Neptunian objects were detected between 1992 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied cerebellar learning tasks is the eyeblink conditioning paradigm, in which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) such as a tone or a light is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), such as an air puff, that elicits <b>a</b> <b>blink</b> response. After such repeated presentations of the CS and US, the CS will eventually elicit <b>a</b> <b>blink</b> before the US, a conditioned response or CR. Experiments showed that lesions localized either to a specific part of the interposed nucleus (one of the deep cerebellar nuclei) or to a few specific points in the cerebellar cortex would abolish learning of a conditionally timed blink response. If cerebellar outputs are pharmacologically inactivated while leaving the inputs and intracellular circuits intact, learning takes place even while the animal fails to show any response, whereas, if intracerebellar circuits are disrupted, no learning takes place—these facts taken together make a strong case that the learning, indeed, occurs inside the cerebellum.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, Charles Kowal {{discovered}} 2060 Chiron, an icy planetoid with {{an orbit}} between Saturn and Uranus. He used <b>a</b> <b>blink</b> comparator, the same device that had allowed Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto nearly 50 years before. In 1992, another object, 5145 Pholus, {{was discovered in}} a similar orbit. Today, an entire population of comet-like bodies, called the centaurs, is known {{to exist in the}} region between Jupiter and Neptune. The centaurs' orbits are unstable and have dynamical lifetimes of a few million years. From the time of Chiron's discovery in 1977, astronomers have speculated that the centaurs therefore must be frequently replenished by some outer reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} capture sections {{of the night sky}} in pairs of images. Each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart. He then placed both images of each section in a machine called <b>a</b> <b>blink</b> comparator, which by exchanging images quickly created a time lapse illusion of the movement of any planetary body. To reduce the chances that a faster-moving (and thus closer) object be mistaken for the new planet, Tombaugh imaged each region near its opposition point, 180 degrees from the Sun, where the apparent retrograde motion for objects beyond Earth's orbit is at its strongest. He also took a third image as a control to eliminate any false results caused by defects in an individual plate. Tombaugh decided to image the entire zodiac, rather than focus on those regions suggested by Lowell.|$|E
5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using <b>a</b> <b>blink</b> comparator, he rapidly shifted {{back and forth between}} views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes the {{appearance}} of floaters has to be attributed to dark specks in the tear film of the eye. Technically, these are not floaters, but they do look the same {{from the viewpoint of}} the patient. Persons with blepharitis or a dysfunctional meibomian gland are especially prone to this cause, but ocular allergies can also cause the problem. To differentiate between material in the vitreous humour of the eye and debris in the tear film, one can look at the effect of blinking: debris in the tear film will move quickly with <b>a</b> <b>blink,</b> while floaters are largely unresponsive to it. Tear film debris is diagnosed by eliminating the possibility of true floaters and macular degeneration.|$|E

Feldmann's [...] "agenda was to have an album that was palatable for a generation of ADD kids." [...] The band members and Feldmann felt a breakthrough in direction with the song [...] "Cynical", which they immediately chose as the opening song on the album. According to Hoppus, the band recorded a total of nearly 50 songs. By mid-February, the album was [...] "70–80%" [...] complete, according to Barker, and work was reportedly completed in early March 2016. By the end of March, the group were still narrowing down the songs that would be present on the album. The trio posted their progress via their respective social media accounts during the recording, in the form of Snapchat and Instagram clips. All parties seemed satisfied with the record. While recording, Barker told an interviewer that [...] "It's honestly the best material we've written or put out in years. I haven't been excited about <b>a</b> <b>Blink</b> album like this in a long time." [...] Feldmann commented, [...] "I'm just so excited to have people hear it.

Isham praised Spears' attitude to the filming of the scene, claiming that she [...] "had not <b>a</b> <b>blink</b> of fear" [...] during the shoot, Spears is sitting on top of a cliff, surrounded by cliffs. Isham also considered the music video one of his favorites, commenting that he had [...] "nothing but positive things to say about my experience with her and what she's doing right now" [...] and that Spears [...] "stepped into it with positive energy. She ended up stepping out and kicking ass, There are 3 versions of the video, Version 1 and 2 has clips from the movie [...] "Crossroads" [...] and Version 3 is the original version."

500|$|In 1987, {{astronomer}} David Jewitt, then at MIT, {{became increasingly}} puzzled by [...] "the apparent emptiness {{of the outer}} Solar System". He encouraged then-graduate student Jane Luu to aid him in his endeavour to locate another object beyond Pluto's orbit, because, as he told her, [...] "If we don't, nobody will." [...] Using telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, Jewitt and Luu conducted their search {{in much the same}} way as Clyde Tombaugh and Charles Kowal had, with <b>a</b> <b>blink</b> comparator. Initially, examination of each pair of plates took about eight hours, but the process was sped up with the arrival of electronic charge-coupled devices or CCDs, which, though their field of view was narrower, were not only more efficient at collecting light (they retained 90% of the light that hit them, rather than the 10% achieved by photographs) but allowed the blinking process to be done virtually, on a computer screen. Today, CCDs form the basis for most astronomical detectors. In 1988, Jewitt moved to the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Hawaii. Luu later joined him to work at the University of Hawaii's 2.24m telescope at Mauna Kea. Eventually, the field of view for CCDs had increased to 1024 by 1024 pixels, which allowed searches to be conducted far more rapidly. Finally, after five years of searching, Jewitt and Luu announced on August 30, 1992 the [...] "Discovery of the candidate Kuiper belt object" [...] Six months later, they discovered a second object in the region, (181708) 1993 FW.|$|E

2500|$|Theoretical models {{predict that}} {{planetary}} nebulae can form from main-sequence stars of {{between one and}} eight solar masses, which puts the progenitor star's age at greater than 40 million years. Although {{there are a few}} hundred known open clusters within that age range, a variety of reasons limit the chances of finding a planetary nebula within. For one reason, the planetary nebula phase for more massive stars is on the order of thousands of years, which is <b>a</b> <b>blink</b> of the eye in cosmic terms. [...] Also, partly because of their small total mass, open clusters have relatively poor gravitational cohesion and tend to disperse after a relatively short time, typically from 100 to 600 million years.|$|E
2500|$|Tombaugh {{used the}} observatory's 13-inch astrograph to take {{photographs}} of the same section of sky several nights apart. He then used <b>a</b> <b>blink</b> comparator to compare the different images. When he shifted between the two images, a moving object, such as a planet, would appear to jump from one position to another, while the more distant objects such as stars would appear stationary. Tombaugh noticed such a moving object in his search, near the place predicted by Lowell, and subsequent observations showed it to have an orbit beyond that of Neptune. This ruled out classification as an asteroid, and they decided this was the ninth planet that Lowell had predicted. The discovery was made on Tuesday, February 18, 1930, using images taken the previous month. The name [...] "Pluto" [...] was suggested by an 11-year-old English schoolgirl, Venetia Burney. It won out over numerous other suggestions {{because it was the}} name of the Roman god of the underworld, who was able to render himself invisible, and because Percival Lowell's initials PL formed the first 2 letters. The name Pluto was officially adopted on May 1, 1930.|$|E
2500|$|... n our fast {{changing}} world where technology is outdated in <b>a</b> <b>blink</b> and future-proofing is the gold standard, the grid has demonstrated remarkable flexibility. Over two hundred years, {{the scale of}} architecture has changed from three-story walk-ups to skyscrapers more than 1,000 feet tall. Parks and avenues unanticipated by the plan have been created. The grid {{gave rise to a}} particular kind of urbanism. Unlike Washington, D.C., and the capital cities of Europe, New York does not have axial avenues that focus on star buildings. New York has buildings that sit cheek by jowl and anonymously form street walls. It has narrow canyons of space bounded by those street walls with views of the horizon. It has density and enclosure but also the thrill of open-ended space. Yet when modernist urban theories turned against the vernacular urbanism of New York, and superblocks and towers in the park were imposed on the city, the grid absorbed those inventions. [...] Although New York's real estate dynamism is typically associated with disrespect for history, with buildings toppled {{for the next generation of}} taller ones, the 1811 grid endures as living history.
