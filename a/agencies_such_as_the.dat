5|$|Despite gaining {{considerable}} power {{during the}} mid twentieth-century, {{the governor is}} still much weaker than those of other states. He has no line-item veto authority, and the pocket veto was ruled unconstitutional. If a governor does not sign or reject a bill, it becomes law automatically. This led to a fist fight during the term of Claude Matthews, who was locked out of the House chambers {{to prevent him from}} returning a bill in time. Vetoes are also easily overridden, requiring only a simple majority as opposed to a supermajority. The legislature still exercises final control over the hiring of state employees, but given the large size of the government and the short legislative sessions, they are unable to make any considerable impact other than their continued advocacy for an expanded merit system. The cabinet is still almost entirely independent of the governor, and he has control over only half of the government's <b>agencies,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Indiana State Police and the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Other large <b>agencies,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Department of Administration, are {{under the control of the}} cabinet.|$|E

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the Virginia Military Institute and Harvard Law School, Lansdale was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve in 1933. He was called up for active duty in June 1941, and {{was assigned to the}} Investigations Branch in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 (military intelligence) of the War Department General Staff. He became involved with the Manhattan Project in 1942, eventually becoming Brigadier General Leslie Groves's special assistant for security. Lansdale coordinated the activities of the Manhattan Project's field security teams with those of other <b>agencies</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> FBI.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1944, the Army {{decentralized}} counterintelligence to {{the service}} commands. Lansdale attempted to have his group exempted from this, but when he failed, Groves had Lansdale's unit reassigned to the Manhattan Project, creating a new Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) unit within the Project. Groves had Lansdale transferred to the Manhattan District, but instead of placing him {{in charge of the}} new CIC unit, Groves made Lansdale his special assistant for security at Manhattan Project headquarters in Washington, D.C. Lansdale coordinated the activities of the Manhattan Project's field security teams with those of other <b>agencies</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> FBI.|$|E

25|$|Many {{environmental}} justice issues are local, and therefore difficult to address {{by a federal}} <b>agency,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> EPA.

5|$|There {{had been}} limited affirmative action {{programmes}} before. However, these mostly {{focused on the}} civil service, as Article 153 of the Constitution did. Admission to higher education was largely merit-based. The Tunku government preferred laissez-faire policies, minimising economic intervention. Although some <b>agencies,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Rural Industrial Development Agency (RIDA), which attempted to aid Malay entrepreneurs, existed, their programs were criticised as being based on handouts and favouring the politically connected. RIDA was renamed as the Majlis Amanah Rakyat (The Indigenous People's Trust Council) or MARA in 1965, and came to symbolise the development of Malay entrepreneurship.|$|E

5|$|Law {{enforcement}} in the United States is primarily {{the responsibility of}} local police and sheriff's departments, with state police providing broader services. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is {{the largest in the}} country. Federal <b>agencies</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws. At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.|$|E
5|$|McVeigh {{later said}} that he had {{contemplated}} assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he {{said that he}} sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement <b>agencies,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.|$|E

50|$|The {{amount of}} {{information}} included on a background check depends {{to a large degree}} on the sensitivity of the reason for which it is conducted—e.g., somebody seeking employment at a minimum wage job would be subject to far fewer requirements than somebody applying to work for a law enforcement <b>agency</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> FBI or jobs related to national security.|$|R

50|$|Ideas for {{legislation}} {{can come from}} many areas, including members, lobbyists, state legislatures, constituents, legislative counsel, an executive <b>agency</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> president or cabinet officer or executive agency, and the usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review. A proposal has usually one of four principal forms: the bill, the joint resolution, the concurrent resolution, and the simple resolution.|$|R
5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about {{recruiting}} processes for local 610 Offices. In rare instances where such information is available, 610 officers appeared to have been drawn from other party or state <b>agencies</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Political and Legislative Committee staff or Public Security Bureaus). Hao Fengjun, a defector and former officer with the 610 Office in Tianjin City, was one such officer. Hao had previously worked for the Public Security Bureau in Tianjin, and was among the officers selected to be seconded to the newly created 610 Office. According to Hao, few officers volunteered for a position in the 610 Office, so selections were made through a random draw. Some 610 Offices conduct their own recruiting efforts to bring in staff with university degrees.|$|E
5|$|Research programs, {{including}} field {{projects such}} as the VORTEX projects (Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment), deployment of TOTO (the TOtable Tornado Observatory), Doppler On Wheels (DOW), {{and dozens of other}} programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. Universities, government <b>agencies</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> National Severe Storms Laboratory, private-sector meteorologists, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the National Science Foundation. The pace of research is partly constrained by the number of observations that can be taken; gaps in information about the wind, pressure, and moisture content throughout the local atmosphere; and the computing power available for simulation.|$|E
5|$|The first Polish {{communist}} government, the Polish Committee of National Liberation, {{formed in}} July 1944, declined to accept jurisdiction over Home Army soldiers, therefore {{for over a}} year Soviet <b>agencies</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> NKVD took responsibility for disarming the Home Army. By war's end, some 60,000 Home Army soldiers had been arrested, 50,000 of whom were deported to Soviet Gulags and prisons; most of these soldiers had been taken captive by the Soviets during, or in the aftermath of, Operation Tempest, when many Home Army units tried to work together with the Soviets in a nationwide uprising against the Germans. Other Home Army veterans were arrested when they approached Polish communist government officials after having been promised amnesty. After a number of such broken promises during {{the first few years of}} communist control, Home Army soldiers stopped trusting the government.|$|E
