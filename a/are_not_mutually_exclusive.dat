5|$|A {{number of}} authors {{have noted that}} the two explanations, as a {{chemical}} defence against predators and as a chemical defence against ectoparasites, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive,</b> and evidence for both explanations exists. The fact that the highest concentrations of toxins are bound in the feathers of the breast and belly, in both pitohuis and ifrits, has caused scientists {{to suggest that the}} toxins rub off on eggs and nestlings providing protection against predators and nest parasites.|$|E
5|$|The first {{proposal}} that the membranes within cells form a single system that exchanges material between its components was by Morré and Mollenhauer in 1974. This proposal was {{made as a}} way of explaining how the various lipid membranes are assembled in the cell, with these membranes being assembled through lipid flow from the sites of lipid synthesis. The idea of lipid flow through a continuous system of membranes and vesicles was an alternative to the various membranes being independent entities that are formed from transport of free lipid components, such as fatty acids and sterols, through the cytosol. Importantly, the transport of lipids through the cytosol and lipid flow through a continuous endomembrane system <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive</b> processes and both may occur in cells.|$|E

50|$|At {{various points}} in history there existed a High King of Ireland, who ruled {{over the other}} kings as suzerain, much like the British High Kings and Anglo-Saxon Bretwalda. There also existed Kings of Tara who did not rule all of Ireland but were {{recognised}} as holding positions of authority over the other kings. These two titles <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive</b> and <b>were</b> often held by the same individual.|$|R

50|$|While SOM and COM were contrapositioned by IBM, they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive.</b> In 1995 Novell contributed ComponentGlue {{technology}} to OpenDoc for Windows. This technology provided different means to integrate between COM- and SOM-based components. In particular, SOM objects {{can be made}} available to OLE2 applications by either late binding bridge (based on IDispatch) or COM interfaces having higher performance. In essence, SOM classes are implementing COM interfaces this way.|$|R

Being a regional power <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive</b> {{with any of the}} other categories of power. The majority of them exert a strategic degree of influence as minor or secondary regional powers. A primary regional power (like Australia) has often an important role in international affairs outside of its region too.|$|R
5000|$|Emergent {{industries}} may supplant legacy brands {{in terms}} of market share of medium without extinguishing their predecessors user base.

The primary channel of consumption <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive</b> to its relative competition. In fact, successful brands may utilise multiple mediums and create a network of complementary auxiliary products.|$|R
25|$|While {{this model}} of infant care is {{substantially}} different from the typical Western neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU) procedures described here, the two <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive,</b> and {{it is estimated that}} more than 200 neonatal intensive care units practice kangaroo care today.

25|$|Chromatography may be preparative or analytical. The {{purpose of}} preparative {{chromatography}} is {{to separate the}} components of a mixture for later use, and is thus a form of purification. Analytical chromatography is done normally with smaller amounts of material and is for establishing the presence or measuring the relative proportions of analytes in a mixture. The two <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Class I chemicals, Class II chemicals are essentially harmless. They stimulate scent and taste receptors {{so as to}} discourage feeding. They tend to have low molecular weight and are volatile and reactive, including acids, aldehydes, aromatic ketones, quinones, and terpenes. Furthermore, they may be aposematic, indicating through odors the presence of chemical defenses. The two different classes <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive,</b> and insects may use combinations of the two.|$|E
5000|$|Manuel Castells {{states that}} {{information}} economy <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive</b> with manufacturing economy. [...] He finds that some {{countries such as}} Germany and Japan exhibit the informatization of manufacturing processes. In a typical conceptualization, however, information economy is considered a [...] "stage" [...] or [...] "phase" [...] of an economy, coming after stages of hunting, agriculture, and manufacturing. This conceptualization can be widely observed regarding information society, a closely related but wider concept.|$|R
5|$|The Government {{argued that}} the {{sections}} of the Act dealing with disputation by petition encompassed any question {{about the validity of}} an election, including the eligibility of a candidate, and that the sections should be interpreted broadly. Sue made a similar argument, saying that the sections allowing disputes by petition and the sections allowing disputes by the relevant house of Parliament <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive</b> and that elections could be disputed by either the Parliament or the people.|$|R
25|$|One key {{concept in}} {{distinguishing}} secret societies from fraternities is that, on campuses that have {{both kinds of}} organizations, one can {{be a member of}} both, (that <b>is,</b> membership <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive).</b> Usually, being a member of more than one fraternity <b>is</b> <b>not</b> considered appropriate, because that member would have divided loyalties; however, typically, there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an issue being a member of a secret society and a fraternity, because they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> considered similar organizations or competing organizations.|$|R
25|$|The Baal kriyah or baal koreh (master of the reading) {{reads the}} weekly Torah portion. The {{requirements}} {{for being the}} baal kriyah {{are the same as}} those for the shatz. These roles <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive.</b> The same person is often qualified to fill more than one role and often does. Often there are several people capable of filling these roles and different services (or parts of services) will be led by each.|$|E
25|$|Oceanic fish (also called {{open ocean}} or {{offshore}} fish) {{live in the}} waters that are not above the continental shelf. Oceanic fish can be contrasted with coastal fish, who do live above the continental shelf. However, the two types <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive,</b> {{since there are no}} firm boundaries between coastal and ocean regions, and many epipelagic fish move between coastal and oceanic waters, particularly in different stages in their life cycle.|$|E
25|$|Coined in {{the early}} 1990s, the term human {{security}} {{has been used by}} thinkers who have sought to shift the discourse on security away from its traditional state-centered orientation to the protection and advancement of individuals within societies. Human security emerged as a challenge to ideas of traditional security, but human and traditional or national security <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive</b> concepts. It has been argued that, without human security, traditional state security cannot be attained and vice versa.|$|E
30|$|We {{concede that}} this is an initial study that was {{designed}} to test usability and, therefore, has its limitations in drawing more detailed conclusions. The sample size in the study was small, and the challenges identified may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a comprehensive list.

50|$|A neophile is {{distinct}} from a revolutionary in that anyone might become a revolutionary if pushed far enough by the reigning authorities or social norms, whereas neophiles are revolutionaries by nature. Their intellectual abhorrence of tradition and repetition usually bemoans a deeper emotional need for constant novelty and change. The meaning of neophile approaches and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive</b> to the term visionary, but differs in that a neophile actively seeks first-hand experience of novelty rather than merely pontificating about it.|$|R
50|$|Natural philosopher Robert Boyle contributed {{greatly to}} the {{understanding}} of respiration by showing that air (or oxygen), which is required for fire in combustion reactions, is also needed for human breathing.1 Despite this, Boyle's works on the mechanical origin of qualities were generally rather remote from Helmontian chemistry; however, Boyle's philosophy and Helmontian iatrochemistry <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive.</b> Like van Helmont, Boyle claimed that spirit of human blood, like other ingredients obtained by the chemical analysis of blood, was no simple substance.|$|R
