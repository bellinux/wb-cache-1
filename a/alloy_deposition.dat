40|$|This meeting comes {{very near}} the 100 th anniversary of the elcctro{{deposition}} f alloys, since the method for brass deposition was discovered in 18413 There has been a steady increase in scientific and industrial interest in this field, especially {{during the last decade}} in which about half of the papers pertaining to <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> have appeared. It may be pointed out that several prominent organi-zations are interested in alloy depositions, but for various reasons are {{not in a position to}} discuss the work. The most outstanding fact of recent years on <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> is that not only color but composition within narrow limits are main-tained in large daily production. <b>Alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> requires close control, but no more so than that required in production plating of the several bright metals. Certainly electrodepositlon f alloys should no longer be considered a laboratory curiosity. INTRODUCTION. For the most part, recent papers on <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> discuss procedures and re-sults of research work. Some suggest practical or industrial applications, hut i...|$|E

40|$|Non-cyanide {{electrolytes}} for silver-indium <b>alloys</b> <b>deposition</b> {{investigated in}} order to adjust electrolysis conditions thus to observe the formation of spatio-temporal structures onto the electrode surface. It was established that the electrolytes for silver-indium deposition prepared with the excess of thiocyanate and iodide complexing agents are stable in time. The alloy electrodeposition is of a regular type where the silver is the more positive metal. The observed oscillations of the potential during galvanostatic deposition of indium in the thiocyanate solution are suggested to appears due to the formation/destruction of some passive layers on the electrode surface. Spatio-temporal structures could be observed during electrodeposition of the alloy from thiocyanate electrolytes...|$|R
40|$|Lead-tin <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> is done commercially from fluoborate bath. Though the {{practical}} aspects of addition agents for producing quality deposits are widely reported, the basic aspects on influence of these addition agents on <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> are important. The techniques of cyclic and linear stripping voltammetry on a copper electrode in a fluoborate solution, {{with and without}} addition agents, have been employed to throw light on the basic aspects, {{with the aim of}} understanding, optimizing and controlling lead-tin alloy depositio...|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical {{equivalent}} {{is defined}} {{in the context of}} the calculation of the current density of electrodeposition of alloys. In order to calculate the current efficiency of the <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> process, it is necessary to know the mass of the alloy expected to be deposited per Faraday of electricity when no other electrode reaction than the <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> occurs at the electrode surface. Since alloys do not have a faxed composition, in other words, since alloys do not obey the law of definite properties, it is not possible to calculate theoretically the mass of the alloy deposited per Faraday. Thus there exists no fixed value for the electrochemical equivalent of an alloy. However, the current efficiency for an <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> process can easily be calculated, without any need to know or define the electrochemical equivalent of an aUoy. An analysis of the alloy deposited can be obtained experimentally and the corresponding Faradays utilised can be calculated. The ratio of this quantity to the number of Faradays passed through the cell would give the current efficiency for the <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> process. The above a [...] <;pects are dealt with in detail in the paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} antimony in chloride-free ethylene glycol and the electrodeposition of antimony-bismuth and antimony-tellurium binary alloys, and bismuth-antimony-tellurium ternary alloys from ethylene glycol solutions were investigated {{by means of}} cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments. It was found that antimony(III), tellurium(IV) and bismuth(III) have comparable diffusion coefficients in ethylene glycol. The electrodeposition potential of antimony was more negative than that of tellurium and the <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> obeyed regular <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> behavior. In the ternary <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> experiments, only a bismuth-telluride alloy could be electrodeposited at low overpotentials and the antimony content in the alloy increased when more negative potentials were applied or when lower rotation speeds were used. Bi 2 Te 3 /(Bi 1 −xSbx) 2 Te 3 multilayers were obtained by alternating the electrodeposition potentials using a rotating disk electrode. During the deposition of antimony by reduction of antimony(III) in ethylene glycol, “explosive” antimony was probably formed. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{protecting}} iron and steel, Cd-Zn, Sn-Zn and Sn-Cd alloys were electrodeposited in cyanide boths. Changes in the alloy compositions under such varying electrolytic conditions as current density and temperature, etc. and {{the properties of the}} <b>alloy</b> <b>depositions</b> were investigated. As a result, it was found that any alloy of desired components could be obtained under some suitable electrolytic conditions, but the alloy compositions varied with the electrolytic conditions employed. Control of anode dissolution was also discussed. These electrodeposited alloys exhibited superior corrosion resistance which was superior to that of single plating, as indicated by the result of the corrosion test in which the test pieces were immersed into NaCI, NH_ 4 Cl and C_ 2 H_ 40 _ 2 solutions. It was possible to obtain excellent protective films by the proper utilization of the unique characteristics of the individual components and by a suitable treatment after plating...|$|R

30|$|Traditionally, in {{materials}} science, the roughness is {{an indicator of}} surface quality and depends on the material processing.

40|$|Cyclic voltammetric {{studies were}} carried out on {{platinum}} in alkaline solution containing cobalt sulphate, sodium tungstate, dimethyl sulphoxide and triammonium citrate. Spectral u. v. absorption studies of cobalt citrate complex indicate the species to be [Co L (H 2 O) 3] 2, where L is triammonium citrate. The deposition of cobalt involves a stepwise electron transfer mechanism. The observed cyclic voltammetric data show that the <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> is possibly from cobalt±tungstate complex. The citrate ions and dimethyl sulphoxide hinder the <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition.</b> Dimethyl sulphoxide, which specifically adsorbs on the electrode surface, favours the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), whereas tungstate hinders the HER.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model based on mixed potential theory was developed {{which was used}} to optimize a non-anomalous Ni–Zn–P electroless deposition process developed by us at USC. The model was developed by assuming an adsorption step {{in addition to the}} electrochemical steps. The concentrations of the Zn and Ni complex were estimated by solving the material balances in addition to the electroneutrality condition and the equilibrium relations. The composition of the coating was estimated from the partial current densities of all charge transfer reactions, which occur at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The model results showed that the adsorption plays {{a significant role in the}} <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> process. From the model results, it was seen that the addition of Zn ions to the bath inhibits the deposition rate by changing the surface coverage of the adsorbed electroactive species on the electrode surface. The model indicated that an increase of pH of the bath increases the <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> rate...|$|E
40|$|Compared to pure zinc plating, {{zinc alloys}} provide several advantages. A zinc alloy {{generally}} offers superior sacrificial protection to steel since it corrodes {{more slowly than}} pure zinc. A search for a non-cyanide zinc plating bath resulted {{on the development of}} a zinc nickel sulphamate bath. To obtain better quality zinc-nickel deposits, triethanolamine was added to the bath. In this paper the influence of triethanolamine in zinc-nickel plating from sulphamate bath has been investigated through current efficiency measurements, cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron microscope, and X-ray diffraction techniques. In the presence of triethanolamine in the zinc-nickel sulphamate bath the current efficiency of <b>alloy</b> <b>deposition</b> increased to a maximum of 99 % at the current density of 1. 5 Adm- 2 and thereafter decreased. TEA adsorbed on the electrode surface obeying Henry’s isotherm. On mild steel surfaces, uniform smooth slate gray deposit with smaller crystallites was produced, in presence of TEA in solution, and the electrodeposits exhibited additional Zn(OH) 2 and g-Ni 3 Zn 22 phases.

Against this, is the danger of triggering an allergic responses although this can be minimised by using nickel alloyed with copper and tin. In order for an <b>alloy</b> electro <b>deposition</b> process to be widely used, the classical cyanide-based process must be replaced with an alternative electrolyte giving comparable deposit properties. On this basis, satisfactory results have been found with deposits up to 30 μm thick, based on alloy compositions of 30 % to 60 % copper, 36 % to 63 % tin and 5 % to 24 % of zinc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Co/Pt multilayers were {{prepared}} on silicon substrates with a Ag buffer of different thickness and Pt intermediate layers {{by using the}} molecular-beam epitaxial technique. The as-deposited films (at 160 C) were then post-annealed for 30 min in a vacuum at a temperature (an) ranging from 260 C to 500 C. The for-mation of CoPt 1 0 -ordered structure were observed for all the samples grown at 160 C. The out-of-plane coercivity () and saturation magnetization () of all Co/Pt multilayer films de-creased monotonically as elevating annealing temperature, owing to the heavy diffusion of Si into Co/Pt films at higher temperatures. When an reaches 500 C, the formation of PtSi phase destroys the magnetic properties.

In this study, the crack-free sample of K 465 /Stellite- 6 laminated material was formed by laser metal deposition shaping to control the cracking behaviour in laser metal deposition of K 465 superalloy. The microstructure differences between the K 465 superalloy with cracking and the laminated material were discussed. The microstructure and intermetallic phases were analyzed through scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

Steel sheets of 100 µm were employed as substrate and were coated in a dc magnetron sputtering unit fitted with a rectangular target of aluminum 2. 0 w% scandium master <b>alloy.</b> After <b>deposition,</b> the substrates were dissolved in an oxidizing medium and thus freestanding aluminum-scandium thin films were obtained. The homogeneous thickness was achieved by a reciprocal movement of the substrate. The influence of a radio frequency bias voltage on the coating properties was investigated.

40|$|Solid {{freeform}} fabrication of engineering materials {{is now possible}} using the Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) technique. Closed loop optical feedback system for DMD makes realistic components with dimensional accuracy of 0. 01 inch. On the other hand, close control of the process parameter can provide microstructure of choice. Such continued capability to control macro and microstructure is creating considerable interest. H 13 tool steel {{is one of the}} difficult <b>alloys</b> for <b>deposition</b> due to residual stress accumulation from martensitic transformation. However, it is the material of choice for the die and tool industry. DMD offers Copper chill blocks and water cooling channels as the integral part of the tool. On the other hand ZrO 2 was co-deposited with nickel superalloys using DMD. This process thus is amenable to produce both macro and microstructure to a designed specification.

30|$|Steigerwalt et al. [164] {{reported}} the successful synthesis of PtRu alloy that was widely dispersed on a graphene carbon nanofiber (CNF) support as an electrocatalyst in DMFC. The catalytic activity was enhanced by ~[*] 50 % relative to that recorded for an unsupported PtRu colloid anode electrocatalyst. Meanwhile, Wang et al. [152] reported that Pt/CNF nanocomposites {{obtained by the}} reduction of hexachloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6) precursor with formic acid (HCOOH) in aqueous solution containing electrospun CNFs at room temperature showed a higher current density than other prepared Pt/CNFs and was approximately 3.5 times {{greater than that of}} the E-TEK Pt/C electrocatalyst. Another research carried out by Giorgi et al. [153] described a CNF and bimetallic PtAu electrode with a single layer and both diffusive and catalytic functions using a decreased noble metal amount (approximately five times less) with a consequent large cost reduction. In addition, the bifunctional electrocatalytic properties were also active for the MOR on the PtAu nanoparticle catalysts [154]. Calderón et al. [155] reported PtRu/CNF prepared via reduction using sodium borohydride (NaBH 4), methanol, and formate ions. This electrocatalyst synthesized by SFM was heat-treated (denoted as SFM TT), which improved its electrocatalytic activity during MOR. Later, Maiyalagan [165] reported that the addition of silicotungstic acid acted as a stabilizer for the PtRu particles on CNT support. The PtRu-supported CNT was prepared by microwave heating of an ethylene glycol (EG) solution of STA, H 2 PtCl 6.6 H 2 O (as Pt precursor), and RuCl 3.xH 2 O (as Ru precursor) with CNF suspended in the solution. The Pt and Ru precursors were loaded on CNF by conventional impregnation method. The results revealed that the PtRu nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on carbon nanofiber support, with an average particle size of 3.9  nm enhanced the catalytic activity toward methanol electrooxidation. As a conclusion, the carbon nanotubes supporting material with high electronic conductivity and high surface area gives an advantage of better dispersion for the Pt or Pt <b>alloys</b> <b>deposition.</b> The higher the surface area of supporting material can reduce the agglomeration of metal particles on it, thus can produce better catalyst morphology for better fuel cell performance.|$|R
