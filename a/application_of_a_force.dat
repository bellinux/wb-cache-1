500|$|Aristotle {{provided}} a philosophical {{discussion of the}} concept of a force {{as an integral part of}} Aristotelian cosmology. In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different [...] "natural places" [...] therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their [...] "natural place" [...] (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to [...] "natural motion", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>force.</b> This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>force</b> needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general.|$|E

30|$|Kuzumaki et al. (2017) {{reported}} that <b>a</b> strong traction <b>force</b> {{applied to the}} tendon gel can form thick fibers.

We assumed that extension stops when the tendon gel becomes resilient to <b>a</b> traction <b>force.</b> While it is generally considered that the physical stability of collagen fibers is more affected by intermolecular cross-links than by intramolecular cross-links, collagen fibers are more strongly bound together when more fibers are cross-linked than when collagen molecules are larger (Graham et al., 1984; Klein et al., 2001). Moreover, Kuhn (1987) {{reported that}} the cross-linking of collagen fibrils lends tensile strength to tendons, whereas Kwansa et al. (2014) indicated that the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> traction <b>force</b> promotes cross-linking between the amino and carboxy I terminals of the collagen fibers, which structurally strengthen the collagen tissue. Furthermore, mechanical stress is essential for the maturity of collagen fibers (Urschel et al., 1988). Similarly, Kuzumaki et al. (2017) reported that when the cross-linking reaction progressed, collagen bundles were formed by a Schiff-base cross-linking reaction, and the bundle became thicker over time.|$|R

The most important finding is <b>an</b> enlargement <b>of</b> the typical horizontal scale of the forming helical convective structures accompanied by a cells merging, an essential increase in the kinetic energy of flows and intensification of heat transfer.
