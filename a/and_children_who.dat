5|$|In 1901 and 1902, Caldas da Rainha welcomed 350 Boer men, women, <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> {{sought refuge}} from the ravages of the Second Boer War in their South African homeland. Initially housed in the thermal hospital, the {{refugees}} were transferred to the park pavilions {{at the onset of}} the bathing season. Some rented rooms in town, marveling at the low rates.|$|E
5|$|The film is set during World War II {{in rural}} Vichy France, and {{begins with a}} nine-year-old French boy, Claude (Mathias Laliberté) {{escaping}} from an orphanage. He decides to avoid state protection. He meets a Romani caravan, an extended family of 20 men, women <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> decide to adopt him. The Romani start calling Claude, Korkoro, the free one. Fascinated by their nomadic lifestyle, Claude decides to stay with them.|$|E
5|$|Time {{spent in}} {{religious}} gatherings interfered seriously with the practical routines of the island. Old ladies <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> made noise in church were lectured at length and warned of dire punishments in the afterworld. During {{a period of}} food shortages on the island, a relief vessel arrived on a Saturday, but the minister said that the islanders had {{to spend the day}} preparing for church on the Sabbath, and it was Monday before supplies were landed. Children were forbidden to play games and required to carry a Bible wherever they went. Mackay remained minister on St Kilda for 24 years.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{protection}} of the National Guard, some miners returned to work and some strikebreakers, imported from the eastern coalfields, joined them as Guard troops protecting their movements. In February 1914, {{a substantial portion of the}} troops were withdrawn, but a large contingent remained at Ludlow. On April 20, 1914, a general fire-fight occurred between strikers and troops, which was antagonized by the troops and mine guards. The camp was burned, resulting in 15 women <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> hid in tents at the camp, being burned to death. Costs to both mine operators and the union were high. This incident brought unwanted national attention to Colorado.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{engagement}} at Wisconsin Heights, the militia {{decided to wait}} until the following day to pursue Black Hawk. They heard, but did not understand, Neapope's speech during the night, and to their surprise, when morning arrived their enemy had disappeared. The battle, though militarily devastating for the British Band, had allowed much of the group to escape to temporary safety across the Wisconsin River. The reprieve was short-lived for many – a group of Fox women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> attempted to escape down the Wisconsin following the battle were captured by U.S.-allied tribes or shot by soldiers further downstream. During the night, while the non-combatants escaped in canoes, Black Hawk and the remaining warriors crossed the river near present-day Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin. The band fled west over rugged terrain toward the banks of the Mississippi River, with a week's head start on the militia.|$|E
5|$|She Has a Name is a {{play about}} human {{trafficking}} written by Andrew Kooman in 2009 as a single act and expanded to full length in 2010. It is about the trafficking of children into sexual slavery and {{was inspired by the}} deaths of 54 people in the Ranong human-trafficking incident. Kooman had previously published literature, but this was his first full-length play. The stage premiere of She Has a Name was directed by Stephen Waldschmidt in Calgary, Alberta in February 2011. From May to October 2012, She Has a Name toured across Canada. In conjunction with the tour, A Better World raised money to help women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> had been trafficked in Thailand as part of the country's prostitution industry. The first performances of She Has a Name in the United States took place in Folsom, California in 2014 under the direction of Emma Eldridge, who was a 23-year-old college student at the time.|$|E

5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is indicated}} as an adjunctive (additional) treatment {{in children with}} drug-resistant epilepsy. It is approved by national clinical guidelines in Scotland, England and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies. Children with a focal lesion (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for surgery {{are more likely to}} become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises that the diet should not be recommended for adults with epilepsy. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low glycaemic index treatment and the modified Atkins diet—to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults. A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are tube-fed.|$|E

25|$|Burning {{solid fuels}} such as coal and {{biofuels}} {{in the home}} for cooking and heating is a dominant global source of PAH emissions that in developing countries leads {{to high levels of}} exposure to indoor particulate air pollution containing PAHs, particularly for women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> spend more time in the home or cooking.|$|E
