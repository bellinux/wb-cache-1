40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} parts of an autonomous robot is to establish the path by which it should navigate in order to successfully achieve its goals. In the case of agricultural robotics, a procedure that determines this desired path can be useful. In this paper, a new virtual sensor is introduced in order to classify the elements of an orange grove. This proposed sensor will be based on a color CCD camera with <b>auto</b> <b>iris</b> <b>lens</b> which is in charge of doing the captures of the real environment and an ensemble of neural networks which processes the capture and differentiates each element of the image. Then, the Houghâ€™s transform and other operations will be applied in order to extract the desired path from the classification performed by the virtual sensory system. With this approach, the robotic system can correct its deviation with respect to the desired path. The results show that the sensory system properly classifies the elements of the grove and can set trajectory of the robot...|$|E
30|$|The DC <b>iris</b> <b>lens</b> has {{the same}} {{construction}} but is less expensive {{since there is no}} amplifier integrated in the lens. Instead, the amplifier is in the camera which drives the <b>lens</b> <b>iris</b> through a cable plugged into the camera. For the DC <b>iris</b> <b>lens,</b> the signal that controls the iris opening and closing should have a stable value if the input signal is constant and should increase/decrease when the input signal decreases/increases. This control is most of the times achieved by a PID controller [6]. The use of a custom PID type of video level control allows an enhanced performance compared to AC <b>iris</b> <b>lens</b> type. For high-end video applications, the DC <b>iris</b> <b>lens</b> is adopted and discussed further below. However, since it is not known in advance which DC <b>iris</b> <b>lens</b> will be attached to the camera, a PID loop should be able to accommodate all DC <b>iris</b> <b>lenses.</b> Hence, such a control is designed to be relatively slow and stability and other problems as for the AC <b>iris</b> <b>lens</b> often occur due to the large variations in characteristics of the various lenses.|$|R

The DC <b>iris</b> <b>lens</b> is controlled by a PID control type, whereas the AC <b>iris</b> <b>lens</b> has a build-in controller that measures the incoming video signal and controls the lens to achieve an adequate lens opening. When this lens control is in operation, other controls (exposure and gain control) are not used. Only when the lens is fully open and the wanted video level is still not achieved, we have to start using exposure and gain controls. A problem with this concept is {{that we do not have}} any feedback from the lens about its opening status; so we have to detect a fully open condition. A straightforward approach for this detection is to observe the error signal [...]...|$|R

The use of epinephrine based eye-drops, {{commonly used to}} treat glaucoma, may also lead to buildup of adrenochrome pigments in the conjunctiva, <b>iris,</b> <b>lens,</b> and retina.|$|R
30|$|To {{control its}} opening, the AC <b>iris</b> <b>lens</b> {{has a small}} {{integrated}} amplifier, which responds {{to the amount of}} scene light. The amplifier will open or close the iris automatically to maintain the same amount of light coming to the image sensor. By adding positive or negative offsets and multiplying this video signal, we explicitly guide the controller in the lens, to open or close the iris. To obtain a stable operation of AC <b>iris</b> <b>lenses,</b> they are constructed to have very slow response to dynamic changes. There are cases where the response is fully absent or follows special characteristics. First, such lenses often have large so-called dead-areas in which they do not respond to the driving signal. Second, the reaction to an intensity change can be nonlinear and nonsymmetrical. Third, a stable output value can have static offset errors.|$|R
3000|$|Adjustable <b>iris</b> <b>lenses</b> can be manual or {{automatic}}. For {{the manual}} lenses, user selects a fixed setting, while the automatic ones feature a dynamical adjustment following a measurement. If this measurement and the aperture control {{occur in the}} lens unit using the actual video signal as input, {{it is said to}} be a video (AC) <b>iris</b> <b>lens.</b> Alternatively, when the measurement occurs outside the lens unit, it is called a DC iris and an external signal is used to drive the <b>lens.</b> The <b>iris</b> is an adjustable opening (aperture), that controls the amount of light coming through the lens (i.e., the [...] "exposure"). The more the iris is opened, the more light it lets in and the brighter the image will be. A correct iris control is crucial to obtain the optimum image quality, including a balanced contrast and resolution and minimum noise.|$|R
3000|$|Due to {{the unknown}} {{nonlinear}} lens components, {{it is not}} possible to make a linear control model by feedback linearization. Instead, a small-signal linearization approach around the working point (LSP) is used [8]. Furthermore, DC <b>iris</b> <b>lenses</b> have a large spread in LSPs: for example, temperature and age influence the LSP in a dynamic way (e.g., mechanical wear changes the behavior of the DC <b>iris</b> <b>lens</b> and with that the LSP). An initial and dynamic measurement of the lens' LSP is required. The initial LSP is fixed, based on an averaged optimum value for a wide range of lenses, and the dynamic LSP value is obtained by observing a long-term [...] "lowpass" [...] behavior of the lens. In addition, the variable friction and mechanical play result in a momentous dead area around the LSP, which we also have to estimate.|$|R
30|$|The core {{problem for}} DC iris control is the unknown {{characteristics}} of the forces and the attached DC <b>iris</b> <b>lens</b> as a system. Each DC <b>iris</b> <b>lens</b> possesses a specific transfer function due to a large deviation of the LSP {{in addition to the}} differences in friction, mass, driving force, equilibrium force, iris shape, and so forth. Using a single control algorithm for all lenses results in a large deviation of control parameters. To cope with this variable and unknown characteristics, we have designed an adaptive feed-back control. Here, the basic theory valid for the linear time invariant systems is not applicable, but it is used as a starting point and aid for the design. As such, to analyze the system stability, we cannot employ the frequency analysis and a root-locus method [7], but have to use a time-series analysis based on a step and sinus responses.|$|R

40|$|There is a {{wide range}} of {{alternative}} fixation techniques of intraocular lenses in the absence of adequate capsular support, such as angle- or iris-supported anterior chamber lenses and intra- / transsclerally-fixated (suture, fibrin glue, etc.) and iris-supported posterior chamber lenses. All procedures have different advantages and disadvantages depending on the anatomical situation and integrity of the capsular bag complex and the neighboring structures such as the iris, sclera and corneal endothelium. Furthermore, life expectancy and ocular comorbidities of the patient should be considered. In the so far largest published (to the best of our knowledge) study on posterior iris-claw aphakic lenses we were able to confirm the very good results of the inverse, retropupillar implantation technique in phakic, aphakic and pseudophakic eyes without adequate capsular support with a low complication rate. In addition, we first reported mid-term results of retropupillary fixated <b>iris</b> claw <b>lenses</b> with an adequate endothelial cell loss of 5. 5 % over a mean follow-up of 34 months. Using light microscopy we were able to analyze morphological characteristics after traumatic and spontaneous disenclavation of <b>iris</b> claw <b>lenses.</b> Based on these results, we do not recommend the controversially discussed reenclavation procedure of traumatically dislocated <b>iris</b> claw <b>lenses.</b> We therefore advise to perform an IOL exchange. Due to the good results of retropupillary fixated <b>iris</b> claw <b>lenses</b> in adults, we introduced this alternative fixation technique in children with good results and a low complication rate. According to our good results in combination with a penetrating keratoplasty, we first combined the retropupillary fixated <b>iris</b> claw <b>lens</b> with a DMEK (Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty) procedure. In summary, the implantation of a retropupillary <b>iris</b> claw <b>lens</b> is a fast, safe, simple and effective surgical correction of aphakia or lens (sub-) luxations in eyes without adequate capsular support.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} ocular findings of the external structures and anterior segment of the eye, detected by biomicroscopic examination in schoolchildren in Natal (RN) - Brazil. METHODS: After previous random selection, 1, 024 pupils from elementary and secondary {{public and private schools}} in the city of Natal were evaluated from March to June 2001. All were submitted to preestablished standard research norms, consisting of identification, demographic information, ophthalmologic biomicroscopic examination, with slit lamp, performed by ophthalmologists from the "Onofre Lopes" University Hospital. RESULTS: Alterations of the conjunctival and palpebral conditions were the most prevalent (10. 4 % and 6. 2 % respectively). Follicles (4. 2 %) and papillae (3. 0 %) were the frequent conjunctival lesions, while blepharitis (3. 5 %) and meibomitis (1. 1 %) were the most detected abnormalities in the eyelids. Upon examining the cornea, <b>iris,</b> <b>lens</b> and anterior vitreous, the most encountered findings were nubecula (0. 5 %), papillary membrane reliquiae (0. 5 %), posterior capsula opacity (0. 8 %) and hyaloid arteria reliquiae (2. 0 %).

The camera was evaluated for effectiveness as a single photon detector by attenuating the beam until its irradiance was consistent with single photon events in the camera pixels for one exposure and examining the signal. These attenuation procedures were then employed using single photon counting modules to detect the interference pattern. The single photon counting modules provided a TTL signal corresponding with single photon detection.

40|$|The eye is {{the major}} organ of vision and highly {{specialized}} for photoreception. It focusses light from an object onto the light-sensitive retina.

40|$|Purpose: To {{visualize}} structural alterations of the cornea, <b>iris,</b> and <b>lens</b> {{in patients}} with exfoliation syndrome (XFS) using a noncontact in vivo laser scanning confocal microscope and to correlate these with the clinical features. Methods: The cornea, <b>iris,</b> and <b>lens</b> of 30 eyes with XFS were imaged using the Rostock Cornea Module of Heidelberg Retina Tomograph II (50 Ã— noncontact Nikon lens, an estimated 1 to 2 Âµm transverse resolution, 500 Ã— 500 -Âµm field of view). Serial transverse section images, as well as anterior segment photographs, were taken and analyzed. Results: The corneal stroma and endothelium of 19 eyes (63 %) showed different amounts and sizes of scattered small hyperreflective deposits. The irides revealed hyperreflective deposits on the anterior outer surfaces and/or pupillary margin corresponding to exfoliation material (XFM) and/or pigment granules. The anterior lens capsule showed varying degrees of peripupillary fibrillar hyperreflective deposits, hyperreflective areas with apparent epithelial cells centrally, and uniform epithelial cells in the clear intermediate zone. On the anterior capsule in 4 pseudophakic eyes, XFM appeared as hyperreflective round deposits. Hyperreflective floating deposits were seen in the aqueous humor in the pupillary region of the posterior chamber of 6 eyes (20 %).
