25|$|Venezuela also {{experienced}} shortages {{of electricity and}} was plagued by common blackouts. On 6 April 2016, President Maduro ordered public workers to not go to work believing it would cut down on energy consumption. However, the workers actually used more energy at their homes using <b>air</b> <b>condition,</b> electronics and appliances. On 20 April 2016, the government ordered the rationing of electricity in ten Venezuelan states, including {{the capital city of}} Caracas; a week after moving Venezuela's time zone ahead and telling Venezuelan women to stop using hairdryers, all attempts to curb electricity usage. Two days later on 22 April 2016, minister of electricity, Luis Motta Dominguez, announced that beginning the next week, forced blackouts were to occur throughout Venezuela four hours per day for the next 40 days.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1920s, Trains #524 and #525 {{were among the}} B's ten daily {{passenger}} trains in each direction between Washington and New York. On May 29, 1929, the B dubbed its mid-afternoon deluxe Washington-New York train the Columbian. By the early 1930s, intense competition from the Pennsylvania Railroad in the New YorkWashington market prompted the B to <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> the train in 1932, the first railroad to do so. Also introduced were the richly-appointed Martha Washington-series dining cars, celebrated for their decor and fresh Chesapeake Bay cuisine served on Dresden china in ornate cars with glass chandeliers and colonial-style furnishings. Dining car specialties included oysters and Chesapeake Bay fish served with cornmeal muffins. In September 1941, the B introduced a new WashingtonChicago all-coach train, calling it the Columbian. The Columbian's former afternoon schedule between New York and Washington was renamed the Marylander.|$|E

It has such a huge patronage such that a supplementary train, Cocanada AC Express, a fully <b>air</b> <b>conditioned</b> train, was introduced between Kakinada and Secunderabad in 2012 to cater to the rush.

25|$|The {{local news}} papers in Hamburg {{were full of}} praise for the modern crew accommodations: The crew of 38 had all a single cabin, except a few mess-boys who were in double berth cabins below the main deck. However, no <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> was fitted in the entire {{passenger}} and crew accommodations, but individual electric fans only, {{in addition to the}} central ventilation system. The upper deck was reserved for 12 passengers, accommodated in 10 single and in one double cabin, all with their own bath rooms. The charterers requested from the owners, that two stewardesses are employed on each ship to look after the well-being of the passengers. The forward front of the superstructure housed the dining room, smoking saloon and the bar, where the captain, chief engineer and first officer were dining with the passengers. The public rooms and the cabins were tastefully furnished with plenty of wood. The boat deck was strictly reserved for the master, the deck officers and the radio operator. The single cabins for the deck crew and the motormen were on the poop deck on two levels. These cabins had a washbasin, but toilettes and showers were for common use. In the deckhouse on the top was the crew bar. The mess rooms with a small pantry for the deck crew and the motormen were located in the aft mast house. Mid ships on the main deck were the engineer's and the chief engineer's cabins, the cabins of the chief steward and the cooks, the galley and the officer's mess. Even the engineers, except for the chief, had a communal shower and toilette.|$|E
500|$|Cornell began {{operating}} a closed loop, central {{chilled water system}} for air conditioning and laboratory cooling in the 1963 using centralized mechanical chillers, rather than inefficient, building-specific air conditioners. In 2000, Cornell began operation of its Lake Source Cooling System which uses the cold water temperature {{at the bottom of}} Cayuga Lake (approx 39°F) to <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> the campus. [...] The system was the first wide-scale use of lake source cooling in North America.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} {{will have a}} total of 59 elevators, five {{of which will be}} double-deck elevators, as well as 12escalators. It will also have the highest observation deck in the world, to which high speed elevators will travel at up to 10 metres (33feet) per second (slightly over [...] ) in both directions. The elevators cannot go faster because the change in air pressure at such a rapid speed could cause nausea; at , the air pressure is over 10 kPa (1.5 psi) lower than at ground level (a 10% reduction in air pressure). They must also be efficient so the cables are not unbearably heavy. Jeddah Tower will have three sky lobbies where elevator transfers can be made, and no elevator will go from the bottom to the highest occupied floor. No official floor count has been given; however, Smith stated in a television interview that it will be about 50 floors more than the Burj Khalifa, which has 163occupied floors, leading to the inference that Jeddah Tower will have over 200floors. The tower will also feature a large, roughly [...] diameter outdoor balcony, known as the sky terrace, {{on one side of the}} building for private use by the penthouse floor at level 157; it is not the observation deck. It was originally intended to be a helipad, but it was revealed to be an unsuitable landing environment by helicopter pilots. The building's large notches will also serve as shaded terraces for other areas of the tower and the exterior of the {{building will}} use low-conductivity glass to save on cooling costs by reducing thermal loads. In addition, the lower air density, exacerbated by the thin desert atmosphere, will cause the outdoor air temperature towards the top of the tower to be lower than the ground level air, which will provide natural cooling. There is also significantly more air flow (wind) at heights, which is very strong at one kilometre and had a large impact on the structural design of the tower. The Burj Khalifa actually takes in the cooler, cleaner air from the top floors and uses it to <b>air</b> <b>condition</b> the building. Jeddah Tower will be oriented such that no façade directly faces the sun; it will also use the condensate water from the air conditioning system for irrigation and other purposes throughout the building.|$|E

This facility satisfies 15% of campus electrical needs, and a university-run, on-campus hydroelectric plant in the Fall Creek Gorge provides an additional 2%.
