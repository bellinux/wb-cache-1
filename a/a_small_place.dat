5|$|Anita and {{the player}} get drunk {{on a table}} {{while the rest of}} the {{characters}} start dancing and flying across the room. Then the player is taken again to the room where Anita was peeling oranges, and then back to the room where both she and Borges were lying shot. The player is then shown leaving the airport carrying Borges on a luggage cart. They arrive at <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>place</b> where the gunfight sequence takes place, followed by the motorcycle ride sequence, which ends with a crash that leads the player into a museum. In this area, there are several plaques showing the game's name and credits. The player leaves the area and goes into a new one where Bernoulli's principle about low and high air pressures is explained. Then, the player is again moved to the motorcycle sequence, where the game ends.|$|E

25|$|Sometime in December 1865, {{crew members}} S.S. Lee, Orris M. Brown, John T. Mason and W.C. Whittle sailed from Liverpool to Buenos Aires, via Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo.

As the animosity of the United States Government began to soften towards them, Brown and Mason returned home; Lee and Whittle returned sometime later.|$|E
500|$|The siege was brief. It {{seems clear}} that the defences of Madinat al-Fath were lacking as the Castilians succeeded in {{capturing}} Gibraltar in 1309. The Castilian account of the First Siege of Gibraltar indicates {{that it was only}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>place,</b> with [...] "one thousand one hundred and twenty-five Moors" [...] within {{at the time of its}} fall. Only two siege engines and a few hundred men were needed to reduce it. After the conquest and the expulsion of the town's population, Ferdinand IV of Castile ordered the defences to be strengthened with the walls repaired, a keep constructed above the town and a dockyard (atarazana) to be built to house galleys. However, the main siege of Algeciras failed, and the Castilians struck a deal with the Granadan sultan allowing them to hold on to Gibraltar.|$|E

2500|$|The London Morning News remarked in 1892, [...] "Dwight, Illinois is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>place.</b> Remove Dr. Keeley from Dwight and {{it would}} be but a pin mark on the state map." [...] The {{founding}} of the Keeley Institute in 1879 by Dr. Leslie Keeley and his associates John R. Oughton and Curtis Judd had great influence {{on the development of the}} village of Dwight. The Lodge, first as Oughton's home and then as the focal point of the internationally known institute has always been one of the most visible reminders in Dwight of the Keeley Institute. The Keeley Institute solidified its place in American culture throughout its period of prominence as several generations of Americans joked about people, especially the rich and famous, who were [...] "taking the Keeley Cure" [...] or had [...] "gone to Dwight." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Beat Hotel" [...] was {{a typical}} European-style {{boarding}} house hotel, with common toilets on every floor, and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>place</b> for personal cooking in the room. Life there was documented by the photographer Harold Chapman, {{who lived in the}} attic room. This shabby, inexpensive hotel was populated by Gregory Corso, Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky for several months after Naked Lunch first appeared. The actual process of publication was partly a function of its [...] "cut-up" [...] presentation to the printer. Girodias had given Burroughs only ten days to prepare the manuscript for print galleys, and Burroughs sent over the manuscript in pieces, preparing the parts in no particular order. When it was published in this authentically random manner, Burroughs liked it better than the initial plan. International rights to the work were sold soon after, and Burroughs used the $3,000 advance from Grove Press to buy drugs (equivalent to approximately $ in today's funds). Naked Lunch was featured in a 1959 Life magazine cover story, partly as an article that highlighted the growing Beat literary movement. During this time Burroughs found an outlet for material otherwise rendered unpublishable in Jeff Nuttall's My Own Mag. Also, some of Burroughs' poetry appeared in the avant garde little magazine Nomad {{at the beginning of the}} 1960s.|$|E
