40|$|Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale preludes are {{varied and}} artistic {{not only in}} the {{treatment}} of chorale melodies, but also in the <b>accompaniments</b> <b>of</b> those chorale melodies. This study examines the <b>accompaniments</b> <b>of</b> Bach's long chorale preludes, focusing on identifying the various types and the characteristics that make them unique. This study investigates the two broad categories <b>of</b> <b>accompaniments</b> depending on whether the motives are chorale-derived or independent of the chorale. While the chorale prelude accompaniments in the first large group are closely related, the <b>accompaniments</b> <b>of</b> the chorale preludes in the second group stand independently and illustrate the vast range of Bach's compositional skill. Both groups demonstrate Bach's interest in expanding his predecessors' models, a trait that can be traced throughout all of Bach's compositional history...|$|R
