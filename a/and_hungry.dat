Next to the poet's wife, by the open door, an angry milkmaid presents her substantial bill, demanding payment for milk, underlining the poet's refusal to provide for his family by getting himself a proper job. The cupboard stands open and empty, save for a mouse; near the door, a dog steals {{the last of the}} family's food from a plate.|$|E
5|$|From here Alcibiades {{joined in}} the siege of Byzantium along with Theramenes and Thrasyllus. A portion of the {{citizens}} of the city, demoralized <b>and</b> <b>hungry,</b> decided to surrender the city to Alcibiades for similar terms as the Selymbrians had received. On the designated night the defenders left their posts, and the Athenians attacked the Peloponnesian garrison in the city and their boats in the harbor. The portion of the citizenry that remained loyal to the Peloponnesians fought so savagely that Alcibiades issued a statement {{in the midst of the}} fighting which guaranteed their safety and this persuaded the remaining citizens to turn against the Peloponnesian garrison, which was nearly totally destroyed.|$|E

The Hull Daily Mail reported in March that Channel 5 were looking at Hull as a potential location for the series, but that the city council had urged residents not to participate. The Yorkshire Post reported a similar approach to residents in Bridlington in April. Love Productions also announced plans for Famous, Rich <b>and</b> <b>Hungry,</b> a two-part documentary for the BBC's Sport Relief that would see celebrities spending time with families experiencing food poverty in order to explore the issue.|$|E
5|$|The Australian advance {{had been}} {{hampered}} by bad weather, steep terrain, supply problems, fatigue {{and the strong}} defence mounted by the Japanese, nevertheless they had secured the Wareo–Gusika spur and the track that ran between Wareo and Bonga. In {{the face of the}} Australian advance on Wareo, early in December the Japanese commander, Katagiri, had ordered his troops, who were weary from the fighting <b>and</b> <b>hungry</b> {{due to a lack of}} supplies, to fall back to the north. The 79th Infantry Regiment, which had been defending the area around the Lakes, was ordered to move back to Kalasa and Sio, while the 80th Infantry Regiment, having been located around Kuanko, followed the 79th and moved east towards the coast.|$|E
5|$|As they {{continue}} walking, SpongeBob constantly sings {{a song about}} how the Krusty Krab pizza is the best pizza on the sea floor, which annoys Squidward. The two gradually become tired <b>and</b> <b>hungry,</b> so SpongeBob suggests they eat coral like the pioneers. Squidward immediately spits out the coral, disgusted by the taste, and demands SpongeBob hand over the pizza so he can eat it, having finally given up hope on getting back to civilization. SpongeBob refuses and a short chase ensues between the two. Just as Squidward is about to grab the pizza, SpongeBob notices a giant rock that he claims the pioneers drove for miles. Incredulous at this claim, Squidward tries to tell SpongeBob {{to forget about the}} pioneers, saying that there are none left because of their unusual travelling methods. He quickly changes his mind after SpongeBob runs him over with the rock and they drive {{it all the way to}} the customer's house.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jack's owner Jack Cowin and his private holding company Competitive Foods Australia began legal {{proceedings}} in 2001 against Burger King's parent Burger King Corporation with a counter-claim {{that the company had}} violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was in breach of the contract. In a decision handed down by the Supreme Court of New South Wales that affirmed Cowin's claims, Burger King was determined to have violated the terms of the contract and as a result was required to pay Cowin <b>and</b> <b>Hungry</b> Jack's a $46.9million (Aus, $41.6million USD 2001) award. The court's decision {{was one of the first}} major cases in Australia that implied that the American legal concept of good faith negotiations existed with the framework of the Australian legal system, which until that verdict, had rarely been seen in the country's courts. In its decision, the Court stated that Burger King had failed to act in good faith during contract negotiations by seeking to include standards and clauses that would engineer a default of the franchise agreement, allowing the company to limit the number of new Hungry Jack’s branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement.|$|E
5|$|Out of options, Buchner opened negotiations, {{using those}} interned {{in the castle}} as hostages. Presenting them at the keep's door, he made clear {{that they would be}} killed unless Ferdinand promised to spare his, his wife's and Sudermann's lives. Ferdinand acceded to Buchner's demand; some sources {{maintain}} that the Abbot of Heisterbach, one of the prisoners, had been treated decently by Buchner throughout his imprisonment in the castle and himself asked for Buchner's life to be spared. The prisoners were released. With much difficulty, given the state of mind of the besiegers, Ferdinand and Arenberg brought the Buchners and Sudermann out of the castle alive. Once the Buchners, Sudermann, and the hostages were clear of the fortress, Ferdinand released his troops, who were in an ugly mood <b>and</b> <b>hungry</b> for blood and plunder. All those who remained in the keep—soldiers, men, women and children—were killed, some inside the keep, some in the courtyard below; the slaughter lasted well into the night. The castle's 178 dead were buried in two mass graves whose locations remain unknown. Among those who perished in the destruction and storming of the castle {{was also one of the}} prisoners, a vicar from Hildesheim. The Hildesheim suffragan, too, was not among the rescued prisoners; he had died during his incarceration, a short while before the castle was stormed.|$|E

Hungry Jack's was successful at trial, the trial judge finding that there had been breaches of contract and breaches of fiduciary duty on Burger King's part, and awarding Hungry Jack's nearly $AU 71 million in damages. Burger King appealed against the decision.|$|E
