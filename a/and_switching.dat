5|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} controversy regarding Holden's decision {{to retain the}} Commodore name for the 2018 model, despite it being dimensionally smaller than its predecessor, lacking a V8 engine option <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> from a RWD to a FWD drivetrain. Whilst the decision has been {{considered to be a}} safe choice in order to preserve sales, the retention of the Commodore name has been critiqued for Holden missing the opportunity to rebrand its sedan range and push its offering into the more lucrative semi-premium end of the market.|$|E
5|$|An {{offshoot}} of the work at MIT {{was the beginning of}} digital circuit design theory by one of Bush's graduate students, Claude Shannon. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of Boolean algebra to electronic circuits in his landmark master's thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay <b>and</b> <b>Switching</b> Circuits. In 1935, Bush was approached by OP-20-G, which was searching for an electronic device to aid in codebreaking. Bush was paid a $10,000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project went over budget and was not delivered until 1938, when it was found to be unreliable in service. Nonetheless, it was an important step toward creating such a device.|$|E

5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of marine}} mammals by the Navy, even in {{accordance}} with the Navy's policy, continues to meet opposition. The Navy's policy says that only positive reinforcement is to be used while training the military dolphins, and that they be cared for {{in accordance with}} accepted standards in animal care. The inevitable stresses involved in training are topics of controversy, as their treatment is unlike the animals' natural lifestyle, especially towards their confined spaces when not training. There is also controversy over the use of muzzles and other inhibitors, which prevent the dolphins from foraging for food while working. The Navy states that this is to prevent them from ingesting harmful objects, but conservation activists say this is done to reinforce the trainers' control over the dolphins, who hand out food rewards. The means of transportation is also an issue for conservation activists, since they are hauled in dry carriers, <b>and</b> <b>switching</b> tanks and introducing the dolphin to new dolphins is potentially dangerous as they are territorial.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} model that leads to an {{equilibrium}} with characteristics similar to the following stylized facts observed in retail markets: (a) Retailers advertise only selected brands; (b) Often low priced advertised brands are understocked; (c) In-store promotions are biased towards more expensive substitute brands. Together these practices constitute illegal bait <b>and</b> <b>switch.</b> Is this phenomenon necessarily harmful to consumers and to the economy? We show that bait <b>and</b> <b>switch</b> can benefit consumers because utility is created through in-store promotions and price competition is enhanced. This suggests that the FTC investigate further its ban on bait <b>and</b> <b>switch.</b> pricing, promotion, regulation, bait <b>and</b> <b>switch...</b>|$|R

40|$|In our 1990 {{paper we}} {{demonstrated}} that a law prohibiting bait <b>and</b> <b>switch</b> {{may have the}} surprising consequence of hurting the consumers {{it was designed to}} protect.

We show here that our earlier conclusion is correct in a more general setting: A law prohibiting bait <b>and</b> <b>switch</b> in a competitive market can reduce consumer well-being but never improve it. When bait <b>and</b> <b>switch</b> occurs, it creates welfare gains, and when it would create welfare losses, it does not occur, regardless of a law prohibiting the practice.
