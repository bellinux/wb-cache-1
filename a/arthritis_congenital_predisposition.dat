30|$|Lumbar spinal {{stenosis}} {{is defined as}} a clinical symptom complex that includes low back pain, bilateral lower extremity pain, paresthesias, and other neurologic deficits. It occurs due to anatomic narrowing of the neural pathway through the spine, which may be centrally located in the spinal canal or positioned more laterally in the lateral recesses or neuroforamina. It is postulated that degenerative lumbar stenosis occurs in a high-risk spine with some underlying <b>congenital</b> <b>predisposition</b> [18], but this has not been proven. The anatomic changes result from a cascade of events that include intervertebral disk degeneration, facet joint arthrosis, and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum [1, 3]. As a result, the biomechanical characteristics of the spinal segment are altered, which further perpetuates a cycle of degenerative changes.|$|R

30|$|Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) {{ankylosis}} can {{be defined}} as the union of mandibular condyle to the cranial base which is the articular surface through osseous or fibrous tissue, with partial or complete mandibular impediment [1]. The etiological factors for TMJ ankylosis include trauma, rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> <b>congenital</b> anomalies, infection, and neoplastic processes. Trauma is well known as the most predominant factor in TMJ ankylosis particularly in children and is associated with inadvertent use of forceps during delivery, traffic accident, and falls [2 – 4]. When TMJ ankylosis occurs in children, the future growth and development of the jaws and teeth are affected negatively. Furthermore, psychosocial development of the children affected is profoundly influenced due to the obvious facial deformity, which worsens as they grow [5]. Condyle reconstruction is carried out in order to restore TMJ function and facial deformity in adults, whereas high incidence of recurrence and the probable change in the unfavorable growth of the mandible are also needed to be considered in children [5, 6].|$|R
40|$|The {{technology}} of artificial joint replacements has evolved rapidly {{over the last}} forty years and has become an overwhelming success. Such an artificial replacement can lead to a dramatic relief of pain and restoration of the joint functions for patients suffering from osteoarthritis, rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> <b>congenital</b> deformities or post traumatic disorders. The most frequently afflicted joint is the hip, which is replaced quite often with a metallic joint. This artificial replacement represents the major success story in orthopedic surgery in the twentieth century; there is much interest in extending research on hip joint even further, early in the twenty first century. The success of a total hip arthroplasty is strongly related to the initial stability of the femoral component and to the stress shielding effect. In fact, for cementless stems, initial stability is essential to promote bone ingrowths into the stem coating. The use of a hollow stemmed hip implant is an important way for reducing the effects of stress shielding. The integration of topology optimization into hip prosthesis design allows generating holes to enhance fixation, and to reduce the volume for light stem structure. To design the hip prosthesis, two ways can be used: The first one consists in studying the hi...|$|R

The 83. 9 % rate of posterior presentation and the 90 % rate of males confirmed the hypothesis of hypomobility of calves affected by congenital articular rigidity. The success rate after appropriate treatment was 82. 8 %. This study also confirmed the predisposition of Belgian Blue calves to tibial fractures (52 %). The success rate of fractures in calves was 74. 1 %. An alternative to treatment in case of quadriceps or combined spastic paresis is fattening. Seventy height percent of affected calves have indeed been fattened with an almost normal growth rate. This alternative remains economically advantageous. 	The second study developed a classification of gastrocnemius spastic paresis based on general examination, special examination and postoperative results.

The empirical laws, destined to verify its deductions, have been formed in abundance by every successive age of humanity; and the premises for the deductions are now sufficiently complete. Excepting the degree of uncertainty which still exists as {{to the extent of}} the natural differences of individual minds, and the physical circumstances on which these may be dependent (considerations which are of secondary importance when we are considering mankind in the average, or en masse), I believe most competent judges will agree that the general laws of the different constituent elements of human nature are even now sufficiently understood to render it possible for a competent thinker to deduce from those laws, with a considerable approach to certainty, the particular type of character which would be formed in mankind generally by any assumed set of circumstances. A science of Ethology, founded on the laws of Psychology, is therefore possible; though little has yet been done, and that little not at all systematically, toward forming it. The progress of this important but most imperfect science will depend on a double process: first, that of deducing theoretically the ethological consequences of particular circumstances of position, and comparing them with the recognized results of common experience; and, secondly, the reverse operation; increased study of the various types of human nature that {{are to be found in}} the world; conducted by persons not only capable of analyzing and recording the circumstances in which these types severally prevail, but also sufficiently acquainted with psychological laws to be able to explain and account for the characteristics of the type, by the peculiarities of the circumstances: the residuum alone, when there proves to be any, being set down to the account of <b>congenital</b> <b>predispositions.</b>|$|R

We report the clinical and molecular {{features of a}} patient initially identified as a potential FA case only because of chemotherapy toxicity during the treatment of a T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cells from this patient showed a moderate chromosomal instability, increasing sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents but normal response to ionizing radiation.

Indications were septic arthritis, benign soft tissue tumors, traumatic and congenital hip dislocation, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and osteochondroma of the acetabulum. Diagnostic arthroscopy was technically feasible in all cases. All cases of septic arthritis were successful treated using arthroscopic lavage and antibiotics.

40|$|Humans have {{an innate}} {{ability to deal}} with numerosity and other aspects of magnitude. This ability is {{generally}} honed through education in and experience with mathematics, which necessarily changes the brain structurally and functionally. These changes can be further manipulated through non-invasive electrical brain stimulation. Studying these processes in the case of maths not only constitutes research of great practical impact – given the importance of numerical skills in today's society – but also makes use of maths as a suitable domain in which to study plasticity. In this thesis, I aimed to explore how expertise with numbers shapes brain and behaviour, and also the degree to which processing numbers is similar to other domains in terms of the necessity of healthy brain regions believed to underlie normal processing within and across these domains. In Study 1, behavioural and structural brain differences were found cross-sectionally between mathematicians and non-mathematicians. A double dissociation between those groups was found between grey matter density in the frontal lobe and behavioural performance: their correlation was positive for mathematicians but negative for controls. These effects may have been caused by years of experience, by <b>congenital</b> <b>predispositions,</b> or, plausibly, by both of these factors, whose disambiguation is non-trivial. Study 2 used transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) to assist arithmetic learning. A novel montage was used to enhance brain function during the stage when it is believed to be most involved. Real as compared to sham tRNS enhanced reaction times (RTs) and learning rate on a calculation-based task, but not on a retrieval-based task. The effects were only observed in conditions of high task difficulty. Study 3 examined structural MRI measures before and after arithmetic training to determine how either frontal or parietal tRNS applied with the task changes the structure of the brain longitudinally as compared to sham. Previous results (including those of Study 2) of behavioural facilitation in terms of enhanced RTs to calculation problems were replicated, and further interpreted. Both frontal and parietal tRNS modulated the changes that occurred, pre-to-post training, in terms of cortical volume and gyrification of frontal, parietal and temporal areas. Study 4 investigated the shared neural and cognitive resources used for processing numerical magnitude and musical pitch, by probing how stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) effects for each of the two dimensions compare in a group of mainly temporoparietal lesion patients with numerical impairments versus controls. A double dissociation was found in that numerically impaired patients did not show the number-based SRC effect but did show the pitch-based one, while control subjects demonstrated the opposite trend. Overall, the results of these studies leave us with three main messages. First, expertise in numbers and mathematics, whether acquired through years of experience (Study 1) or through a few days of tRNS-assisted training (Study 3), appears to be associated with complex changes in the morphology of several brain structures. Some – but not all – of these structures are maths-relevant, and, in the case of tRNS-assisted training, they are distal {{to the site of the}} stimulating electrodes. Second, tRNS can improve performance in arithmetic (Studies 2 and 3), although the mechanisms by which this occurs are not yet fully understood, neither neurally nor behaviourally. Third, I found (Study 4) that brain lesions leading to impairment in the number domain do not necessarily affect processing in other domains – such as pitch – that are otherwise linked to number via a putative common code in the parietal lobes.

Radiographic evaluation consisted in antero posterior and axial views of the hip. One patient was operated bilaterally, with a total of 18 hips operated, and mean follow up of 8 years (5 - 12). Results: Diagnosis of secondary arthritis was: developmental hip dysplasia in 12 patients, septic arthritis sequelae in 3 patients and other causes of hip arthritis in 3 patients. Average Merlé-D´Aubigné score was 9, 9 (8 - 13) preoperatively and 16, 10 (13 - 18) at last follow-up.

Mice deficient in both FancC and Mus 81 that survived to birth exhibited growth defects and an in-creased incidence of congenital abnormalities. This cooperativity of FancC and Mus 81 in developmental outcome was also mirrored in response to crosslink damage and chromosomal integrity.

These treatments have varying degrees of success and adverse effects, but the rarity of the condition prevents any evidence-based recommendations...|$|R
40|$|Arthritis can be {{idiopathic}} or {{caused by}} inflammatory disease (for instance rheumatoid <b>arthritis),</b> posttraumatic, <b>congenital,</b> or as a resultant of avascular necrosis {{of one of}} the carpal bones. The common factor in all these causes is that the normal biomechanics are disturbed, either by disturbance of the joint surface or by instability of the ligaments. Prevention of further deterioration in the early stages is aimed at restoring the normal biomechanics; correction malunion, restoring ligaments, improving vascularity. If the patient is seen at a later stage or early treatment has failed salvage procedures can be an option, but they sacrifice or replace part of the joints. In part 1 is described how according to literature, rheumatoid arthritis leads to instability which results in a destruction of the wrist, how it is diagnosed and what the treatment options are(chapter 2). Further it is demonstrated that the DASH can be used in rheumatoid arthritis (chapter 3) and that the radio-scapholunate arthrodesis is a good option in rheumatoid arthritis of the wrist (chapter 4 and 5). In part 2 the outcome is described of the radial shortening osteotomy for Kienböck’s disease, which is also a cause of joint degeneration through osteonecrosis of the lunate (chapter 6). Osteoarthritis of the trapeziometacarpal joint which is most often idiopathic can be treated with simple resection as shown in Chapter 7. The short term outcome as well as the pitfalls when using the Nugrip CMC implant as an alternative to simple resection are described in Chapter 8...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDiamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is {{a severe}} {{congenital}} anemia {{characterized by a}} specific decrease of erythroid precursors. The disease is also associated with growth retardation, <b>congenital</b> malformations, a <b>predisposition</b> for malignant disease and heterozygous mutations in either of the ribosomal protein (RP) genes,,,, and We show herein that primary fibroblast from DBA patients with truncating mutations in or in have a marked reduction in proliferative capacity. Mutant fibroblasts are associated with extended cell cycles and normal levels of p 53 when compared to w. t. cells. mutant fibroblasts accumulate in the G 1 phase, whereas the mutant cells show an altered progression in the S phase resulting in reduced levels in the G 2 /M phase. RPS 19 deficient cells exhibit reduced levels of Cyclin-E, CDK 2 and retinoblastoma (Rb) protein supporting a cell cycle arrest in the G 1 phase. In contrast, RPS 24 deficient cells show increased levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p 21 and a seemingly opposing increase in Cyclin-E, CDK 4 and CDK 6. In combination, our results show that RPS 19 and RPS 24 insufficient fibroblasts have an impaired growth caused by distinct blockages in the cell cycle. We suggest this proliferative constraint {{to be an important}} contributing mechanism for the complex extra-hematological features observed in DBA...|$|R
