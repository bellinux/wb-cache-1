40|$|It {{is often}} argued that an {{observation}} of rising annual income inequality {{need not have}} negative normative implications. The argument is that {{if there has been}} a sufficiently large simultaneous increase in mobility, the inequality of income measured over a longer time period can be lower despite the rise in <b>annual</b> <b>inequality.</b> In this paper, it is shown by example that if normative implications are drawn from a standard social welfare function, the set of circumstances put forward in the above argument are not sufficient to guarantee that social welfare will improve. The reason is that even though rising mobility does reduce longer term inequality, it also increases the variability of income profiles over time and the latter has a detrimental social welfare effect. Hence, {{there are two types of}} mobility: one which reduces inequality (regression to the mean), but another that increases inequality (relative movements uncorrelated with incomes). Further, if individuals' aversion to income variability is sufficiently larger than the social welfare judge's aversion to inequality, then an increase in mobility, no matter how large, cannot offset the negative normative effect of rising <b>annual</b> <b>inequality.</b> Copyright 2002 by Blackwell Publishers Ltd/University of Adelaide and Flinders University of South Australia...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look at}} {{lifetime}} inequality to address two main questions: How well does a modern tax system, based on annual information, target lifetime inequality? What aspects of the tranfser system are most progressive from a lifetime perspective? To answer to these questions {{it is crucial to}} relate lifetime and <b>annual</b> <b>inequality</b> and determine the main building blocks of lifetime disparities. We look at lifetime inequality and the redistribution properties of taxes and benefits using a dynamic life-cycle model of women's education, labour supply and savings with family dynamics and rich individual heterogeneity in preferences and productivity. The model is coupled with {{a detailed description of the}} UK personal tax and benefit system and is estimated on UK longitudinal data covering the 1990 s and early 2000 s. We show that the tax and benefits system is more redistributive from an annual than from a lifetime perspective, and it most progressive at the bottom of the income distribution in both cases. We then establish that heterogeneity in family experiences throughout adult life is the main vehicle through which the tax and benefits system moderates lifetime inequality. Although transitory, family conditions under which working is especially costly, such as lone-motherhood, are escpecially prevalent among the lifetime poor. By targeting this group, particularly using policies specifically designed to improve the work incentives of those with the lowest earnings capacity, the tax and benefits system does achieve life-cycle redistribution. Other policies like universal benefits towards family with children are less well targeted towards the lifetime poor but are more progressive and improve the work incentives in the middle 60 % of the distribution of lifetime income. female laboursupply, life-cycle, inequality, redistribution, taxe...|$|E
40|$|Income {{variability}} {{explains a}} significant {{fraction of the}} increase in annual income inequality. Chapter 1 considers the impact of variability on tax unit inequality. Using income tax return panel data, I estimate that between a tenth and a quarter {{of the increase in}} top one percent income shares between the early 1980 s and 2000 s was caused by variability. Increased income variability over this period resulted from mean-reverting fluctuations in the bottom quintile and top one percent. Variability {{in the top of the}} distribution seems partly driven by permanent income shifting in response to the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Chapter 2 examines the individual earnings distribution. Using Social Security Administration earnings panel data, I estimate that variability explains half of the increase in <b>annual</b> <b>inequality</b> in the bottom half of the distribution between 1973 and 1985. When workers with years of zero earnings are included, increasing earnings variability explains almost all of this group's increase in inequality. The increase in earnings variability appears to be explained by an increased fraction of working age men with years of zero earnings. Annual individual earnings inequality in the bottom half of the distribution not only increased with variability in the 1970 s and 1980 s, but also fell with variability in the 1950 s and early 1960 s. This suggests that the U-shaped trend in income inequality observed over these four decades was partly caused by first a fall and then a rise in earnings variability. Between 1985 and 2000, falling variability caused most of the decline in annual earnings inequality within the bottom half of the distribution. Within the top of the distribution, earnings inequality increased over this period because of changes in permanent earnings and not increasing variability. Income variability means that in a progressive tax system annual and lifetime federal tax rates can diverge. Chapter 3 shows that on an annual basis, those at the bottom of the distribution pay little or no federal income taxes, while on a lifetime basis they pay average tax rates about five percentage points higher. Income variability also means there is a trade-off between vertical and horizontal equity...|$|E

The magnetic data at Colaba were collected through eye-observation instruments from 1841 to 1872 and by photographic (magnetograph) instruments from 1872 to 1905, which reveal seasonal and other periodic effects on geomagnetic elements. Seasonal influence can be deciphered on the H minimum, but not on the maximum; the disturbances in March and April were opposite to those in December and January. D was maximum in 1880 (57 ' E) and minimum in 1904 (10 ' E). The data from 1882 to 1905 revealed that H <b>annual</b> <b>inequality</b> was influenced by 5. 5 -year periodicity, D by 13. 5 days from 1888 to 1905, and I and Z by 11 -year periodicity from 1894 to 1905 and 1873 to 1905, respectively. Secular variation of Z was parallel to that of I. Z exhibited an increasing trend from 1868 (12 874 nT) to 1905 (15 083 nT). The plan and location of Colaba–Alibag as well as the instruments used are discussed. The initial Colaba magnetic data containing "magnetic disturbances" was harnessed to identify the "disturbing point" on Earth. Nanabhoy Moos, the first Indian director, presciently hinted at a solar origin for magnetic disturbances, revealed the dependence of magnetic elements on the sunspot cycle, unraveled disturbance daily variation, and tried to understand the association, if any, between geomagnetic, seismological and meteorological phenomena. The two giant volumes published in 1910 attest to Moos' seminal work and his inventiveness in organizing and analyzing long series data. He also had a major role in moving Colaba magnetic observatory to Alibag. Thus, the observatory and Moos had a synergestic relationship influencing each other.

40|$|Excerpt] Income {{inequality}} {{has been}} increasing in the United States over the past 25 years. Several factors {{have been identified as}} possibly contributing to increasing income inequality. Some researchers have suggested the decline in unionization and a falling real minimum wage as the primary causes. Others have argued that rising returns to education and skill-biased technological change are the important factors explaining rising inequality. Most analysts agree that the likely explanation for rising income inequality is due to skill-biased technological changes combined with a change in institutions and norms, of which a falling minimum wage and declining unionization are a part. Since most people are concerned with upward mobility, and given the central importance of income mobility to the debate over income inequality, this report examines the relation between income mobility and inequality. Income mobility studies are an important complement to income inequality studies — income inequality does not address the {{issue of whether or not}} the poor are getting poorer, whereas income mobility does. While there appears to be considerable relative income mobility (about 60 % of individuals change income quintiles over 10 years), it is not far — about 60 % of those individuals who changed income quintile in the 1980 s or 1990 s only moved to the next quintile. But most individuals in the poorest quintile in 1980 experienced an increase in their real income between 1980 and 1989 — half saw their real income increase by more than 36 %. Of those in the richest quintile, almost half saw their real income fall by 10 % or more during the 1980 s. But there are differences in income changes between the 1980 s and the 1990 s: those in the poorest income quintile may have done slightly better in the 1990 s than in the 1980 s, while individuals higher up in the income distribution (quintiles 2 - 5) appear to have done better in the 1980 s than in the 1990 s. In both the 1980 s and 1990 s, income growth was progressive and had an equalizing effect on the income distribution, but the equalizing effect had a larger absolute value in the 1990 s than in the 1980 s. Mobility, however, had a disequalizing effect and, in fact, outweighed the progressivity effect, thus increasing the <b>annual</b> <b>inequality.</b> In both decades, the long-term income inequality is lower than the income inequality in the first year of the decade. The results suggest that mobility had a greater equalizing effect on long-term inequality in the 1990 s than in the 1980 s. Three broad types of government economic policy affect income growth and mobility, and hence income inequality: (1) regulation, (2) the tax system, and (3) government transfers. Economic policies to reduce the growth of income inequality may work, in part, through their effects on income mobility. Reducing income mobility (that is, stabilizing incomes) may reduce the rising trend in income inequality, but it could also increase inequality of longer-term income...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationships}} between <b>annual</b> and subannual <b>inequality</b> and mobility {{during the course of}} the year. We apply an exact decomposition framework as outlined in Wodon and Yitzhaki (Econ Bull 4 : 12 ̆ 0138, 2003), and in Yitzhaki and Wodon (Research on Economic Inequality 12 : 1792 ̆ 013199, 2004). Earnings records of pension insurants in Germany serve as the database. The long time horizon of our database allows us to investigate the stability and robustness of the parameters of the decomposition over time. Specifically, we show that the mobility component of the decomposition, as measured by Gini correlation coefficients, changes over the observation period. This makes it difficult to predict the impact of the income accounting period on inequality in a more general context. Thus, it is of paramount importance to use income data from a uniform accounting period in distributional analyses. The final publication is available at www. springerlink. com: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{the impact}} of the measure of the living {{standard}} on poverty and inequality diagnosis. Three measures are assessed on the fourth waves of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP). The first one divides the household instantaneous income by the current consumption units. The two others use the annual income instead of the instantaneous one. The difference between the two measures is that one refers to the current consumption units, whereas the other one accounts for the effective presence of each household member during the last twelve months. Poverty and inequality diagnosis on the whole population does not differ significantly between the last two measures. However, it may display important differences when one focuses on specific households, particularly those that are more subject to important changes in household composition. The diagnosis based on an instantaneous measure of income differs significantly from those based on the <b>annual</b> income. <b>Inequalities</b> seem to be more important according to instantaneous income (Gini and Theil Indexes are greater) and poverty more frequent with 9. 8 % of the households (instead of 8, 5 % for annual income) in 1995. The profile of poor households depends on the measure of income. According to the instantaneous income, blue-collar workers represent half of the poor households instead of one third in the case of annual income. At the individual level, poor active workers account for 2. 1 millions according to instantaneous income compared to 1. 8 millions according to annual income. poverty diagnosis, working poors, inequality indexes...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} goal of {{the paper}} is to give {{a detailed description of}} the development of inequality and stratification in Germany, with respect to regional differences, by applying a new method for detecting stratification in a given society with respect to the distribution of income For the decomposition of inequality in economic well-being (as measured by <b>annual</b> income) additive <b>inequality</b> indices are most popular. Unfortunately the Gini index cannot be decomposed in an additive manner. However, this disadvantage can be turned into an advantage, because the decomposition proposed by Lerman & Yitzhaki (1991) delivers an overlapping index for different income strata which is helpfully very much in interpreting time series of decompositions. We apply this method, which is extended by the estimation of confidence bands by means of a jackknife approach. The formula of the Gini used in this paper is therefore a covariance based formula derived by Lerman and Yitzhaki (1989), the applied decomposition technique is presented in Lerman & Yitzhaki (1991) as well as in Yitzhaki (1994) and for the calculation of the confidence interval see Frick et al. (2004). In our empirical application we make use of representative micro-data for privat...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of economic wellbeing is {{generally regarded as}} one of the key performance indicators of a society and economic wellbeing is strongly influenced by income, wealth and consumption. Despite this, almost all studies of inequality in Australia have relied upon income as the sole measure of economic wellbeing, due in large part to the ready availability of income data. This thesis attempts to redress that deficiency. This thesis provides an insight into an under-researched but vitally important topic - the {{distribution of}} wealth. Specifically the research has three goals. The first is to provide estimates of the level and distribution of wealth in Australia at the current time and the trends over the past decade or two. The second aim is to provide projections of the future wealth distribution. The final goal is to see if there are significant differences between the distribution of lifetime wealth and the annual cross-sectional distribution of wealth. The research uses a technique not previously used in Australia to estimate wealth in the future - dynamic microsimulation. The microsimulation model used is based on a starting sample of 150, 000 individuals and this large number allows a large range of experiences to be modelled, while not having the high costs, years of commitment and other problems associated with undertaking panel studies. This thesis estimates that the average levels of wealth will increase significantly over the 40 -year period from 2000 to 2040 but that wealth inequality will increase over the same period. The reasons for the increases in wealth inequality appear to be due to changes in asset ownership, particularly lower levels of home ownership; the ageing population; and increases in inequality within age cohorts. The research found that lifetime wealth inequality for a sub-group of Generation X differed from the distribution based on annual data. The lifetime wealth inequality was significantly less than the <b>annual</b> wealth <b>inequality...</b>|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} {{evidence}} on cross-national comparisons of <b>annual</b> disposable income <b>inequality</b> in over 20 wealthy nations. We begin by reviewing a number of conceptual and measurement issues which must be addressed by any cross-national comparison of survey based household income data. With these caveats in mind, we present data on both the level of inequality during the early-to-mid- 1990 s, and trend in inequality since 1970. While most comparisons are made in terms of relative incomes within nations, we also make some real income comparisons {{at a point in}} time using purchasing power parities. The data indicate that a wide range of inequality exists across these rich nations during this decade, with the most unequal nation experiencing a level of inequality which is more than twice the level found in the most equal nation. Country specific trends in income inequality are more similar, though not universally so. The large majority of nations have experienced rising income inequality over the last decade or longer. This increase is not offset by changes in income mobility over this period, and follows a period of declining income inequality in most of these same nations.
