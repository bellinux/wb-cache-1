5|$|After {{advancing}} to the Imperial Age, players can also construct <b>a</b> <b>Wonder,</b> an extremely expensive non-military building. On many gameplay modes, building <b>a</b> <b>Wonder</b> triggers a victory countdown—unless it's destroyed within a certain timeframe, the building player wins. Every civilization's Wonder is {{in the shape of}} a landmark unique to that historical culture—the Temple of Heaven for the Chinese, for example, or Notre Dame for the Franks.|$|E
5|$|In Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties, {{the three}} new civilizations must build <b>a</b> <b>Wonder</b> to advance from age to age, instead of {{advancing}} from the Town Center. Unlike previous Age of Empires games, the player does not achieve victory by building <b>a</b> <b>wonder.</b> Players {{can choose from}} a selection of wonders, each having benefits unique to their civilization. Once built, this wonder provides an initial bonus of units or resources, while continuing to provide a benefit to the player's civilization. This initial bonus becomes larger, depending on which age is being advanced to. Since the wonder is a building, players can assign different numbers of villagers to build it, which affects the speed of advancement. Wonders that are destroyed cannot be rebuilt.|$|E

She is the daughter of a golden age superhero and a princess of an alien planet. She is also Blackwolf's ex-wife. Her powers are flight, super-strength, micro-vision, and a protective forcefield.|$|E

5|$|Additional game modes are {{available}} to the player in The Age of Kings. One mode, random map, generates a map from one of several randomly chosen map generating scripts, with players starting in the Dark Age with a Town Center, three villagers (or more depending on civilization), and a scout unit. The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as <b>a</b> <b>Wonder</b> and keeping it standing for {{a certain amount of}} time, or by obtaining control of all relics on the map for a set amount of time. Deathmatch mode allows players to begin with large amounts of resources, creating a focus on military dominance, while in the regicide mode each player is given a king unit, winning by killing all of the other monarchs.|$|E
5|$|In April 1735, Linnaeus and Sohlberg {{set out for}} the Netherlands, with Linnaeus to take a {{doctoral}} degree in medicine at the University of Harderwijk. On the way, they stopped in Hamburg, where they met the mayor, who proudly showed them <b>a</b> <b>wonder</b> of nature which he possessed: the taxidermied remains of a seven-headed hydra. Linnaeus quickly discovered it was a fake: jaws and clawed feet from weasels and skins from snakes had been glued together. The provenance of the hydra suggested to Linnaeus it had been manufactured by monks to represent the Beast of Revelation. As much as this may have upset the mayor, Linnaeus made his observations public and the mayor's dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum were ruined. Fearing his wrath, Linnaeus and Sohlberg had to leave Hamburg quickly.|$|E
5|$|Monson briefly {{taught at}} the University of Utah, then began a career in publishing. His first job was with the Deseret News, where he became an {{advertising}} executive. He joined the advertising operations at the Newspaper Agency Corporation at its formation in 1952. One year later, Monson transferred to the Deseret News Press, beginning as sales manager and eventually becoming general manager. While at Deseret News Press, Monson worked to publish LeGrand Richards's A Marvelous Work And <b>A</b> <b>Wonder.</b> He also worked with Gordon B. Hinckley, the LDS Church's representative on publications, with whom he would later serve in the First Presidency.|$|E

5|$|This video, {{which was}} {{directed}} by Diane Martel, features Beyoncé walking through a performance hall in modern-day street clothes, performing the song. Once she arrives onstage and at the song's bridge, she appears in costume as Deena, dressed in a 1970s-era gown. Intercut into the video are scenes from Dreamgirls, most of which depict Deena's relationship with Curtis. These clips, however, were taken out in the director's cut version of the video; this version appeared on the B'Day Anthology Video Album. In her first outfit, Beyoncé is seen wearing <b>a</b> <b>Wonder</b> Woman T-shirt.|$|E

60|$|Amidst <b>a</b> <b>wondering</b> silence, we three {{walked out}} of the Jolly Bargemen, and in <b>a</b> <b>wondering</b> silence walked home. While going along, the strange gentleman {{occasionally}} looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of his finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front door. Our conference was held in the state parlor, which was feebly lighted by one candle.|$|R

25|$|Before the {{reinforcements}} arrived, De Vecchi {{chose the}} age old tactic of divide and rule, and offered great rewards, money and prestige to any clans {{who chose to}} support the Italians.

There are {{numerous}} cultural and research institutes located in the city, such as the American Academy in Rome, and The Swedish Institute at Rome.

The Colosseum, arguably one of Rome's most iconic archaeological sites, is regarded as <b>a</b> <b>wonder</b> of the world.|$|E
25|$|Walls {{and towers}} are {{defensive}} structures, {{which are not}} able to train units, and are used only for the purposes of defense. They are able to research some upgrades, although these are generally only useful to the building performing the research. Another type of building available to players, is a Wonder: a grand building that represents an architectural achievement of the civilization. In certain game modes, once a player builds <b>a</b> <b>wonder,</b> a ten-minute countdown begins. If the wonder is still standing after the countdown ends, the player who built the wonder wins.|$|E
