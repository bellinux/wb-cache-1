25|$|Before any of {{us could}} rise to examine it, four more lights {{appeared}} almost simultaneously, about the same shape, and varying only in size. Surrounding each one was the dim outline of a small human figure, black and grotesque, more like a little image carved out of black shining wood, than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>I</b> can liken them to. Dorothea kissed her hands to these dreadful little shapes, and Michael bowed with great reverence. As {{for me and my}} companions, we were so awe-struck yet amused at these comical shapes, that we could not move or speak until they themselves seemed to flit about in a sort of wavering dance, and then vanish, one by one.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also well-liked by the band. Mick Avory, who noted the song {{as one of}} the songs he was most proud to be {{associated}} with, said [...] "I always liked 'Lola', I liked the subject. It's not like <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> liked it for that. We'd always take a different path". In a 1983 interview, Ray Davies said, [...] "I'm just very pleased I recorded it and more pleased I wrote it". The band revisited the [...] "Lola" [...] character in the lyrics of their 1981 song, [...] "Destroyer", a minor chart hit in America.|$|E
500|$|In January 1996, Madonna {{travelled}} to Buenos Aires {{to research}} Eva's life, {{and met with}} several people who had known her before her death. During filming, she fell sick many times due to the intense emotional effort required, and midway through production, she discovered she was pregnant. Her daughter Lourdes was born on October 14, 1996. Madonna published a diary of the film shoot in Vanity Fair. She said of the experience, [...] "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because {{it was much more}} than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time... And I am prouder of Evita than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>I</b> have done." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{are a very}} {{remarkable}} man, Dick!' said my aunt, {{with an air of}} unqualified approbation; 'and never {{pretend to}} be <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> for <b>I</b> know better!' ...|$|R
500|$|Before {{starting}} filming {{or making}} an entrance on stage, Terry-Thomas had a routine he would undertake: [...] "my own technique {{to get myself}} going was... to jump {{in the air and}} execute a few dance steps". His approach for much of his film work was to underplay many of his reactions. Filming a scene in a cinema in Private's Progress, a close-up was needed showing his character [...] "registering shock, fury, indignation and <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>I</b> could stuff in"; he [...] "just looked into the camera and kept my mind blank. It's a trick I've used often since. In this way, the audience does the work". Terry-Thomas said [...] "I like to do my own stunts", which he did for films such as A Matter of WHO and Bachelor Flat. This included some dangerous work; for example, during Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines, he ran along the roof of a moving train.|$|E
500|$|Justice Stevens, {{joined by}} Burger, Stewart and Rehnquist, concurring in part and dissenting in {{part in the}} judgment, found it {{unnecessary}} {{to determine whether a}} racial preference was ever allowed under the Constitution. [...] A narrow finding that the university had discriminated against Bakke, violating Title VI, was sufficient, and the court was correct to admit him. [...] "It is therefore perfectly clear that the question whether race can ever be used as a factor in an admissions decision is not an issue in this case, and that discussion of that issue is inappropriate." [...] According to Stevens, [...] "he meaning of the Title VI ban on exclusion is crystal clear: Race cannot be the basis of excluding anyone from a federally funded program". He concluded, [...] "I concur in the Court's judgment insofar as it affirms the judgment of the Supreme Court of California. To the extent that it purports to do <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> <b>I</b> respectfully dissent." ...|$|E
500|$|Biko {{spent two}} years at St. Andrews Primary School and four at Charles Morgan Higher Primary School, both in Ginsberg. Regarded as a {{particularly}} intelligent pupil, {{he was allowed to}} skip a year. In 1963 he transferred to the Forbes Grant Secondary School in the township. Biko excelled at maths and English and topped the class in his exams. In 1964 the Ginsberg community offered him a bursary to join his brother Khaya as a student at Lovedale, a prestigious boarding school in Alice, Eastern Cape. Within three months of Steve's arrival, Khaya was accused of having connections to Poqo, the armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), an African nationalist group which the government had banned. Both Khaya and Steve were arrested and interrogated by the police; the former was convicted, then acquitted on appeal. No clear evidence of Steve's connection to Poqo was presented, but he was expelled from Lovedale. Commenting later on this situation, he stated: [...] "I began to develop an attitude which was much more directed at authority than at <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> hated authority like hell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I was thinking. Everybody agrees that {{diamonds}} will go further {{with a girl}} than <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> When <b>I</b> told the governor he quite jumped at the idea." ...|$|R
6000|$|Carrie {{held her}} arms out. [...] "I wouldn't be <b>{{anything}}</b> <b>else</b> if <b>I</b> could. You know that, too. Come and kiss me, Charley, and never say {{anything of the}} kind again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{never was}} <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> since <b>I</b> knew him. What {{are we to}} do now? Forster says it won't look well {{to ask for a}} {{separation}} only because he's insane. He tried to shoot you?" ...|$|R
500|$|The {{character}} {{also had}} a brief sexual relationship with hospital Lothario Sam Strachan. She and Sam had a one night stand in episode [...] "The Borders of Sleep", {{and went on to}} become close friends, with Maddy assisting Sam in caring for a teenage prostitute he felt responsible for. She also supported him through his Non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, and enlisting his support in illegally proving a patient's death through negligence. In the show's tenth series, Maddy also formed a fast respect for the new head of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit, Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow). Pow ruled out a romance between the two characters, however, stating: [...] "They're protective of each other, but they're more like brother and sister than <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> don't think he's ready for the relationship merry-go-round at Holby just yet". He added that: [...] "Any man would be a fool to turn down Maddy, but Linden wants his wife back". Similarly, Lewington has assessed that neither Sam nor Linden are Maddy's ideal man, and instead she is [...] "waiting for a new hunk!" ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1996 musical, Evita, Madonna {{played the}} title role of Eva Perón. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Perón and wrote to {{director}} Alan Parker to explain why she would be perfect for the part. She said later, [...] "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because {{it was much more}} than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time. And I am prouder of Evita than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>I</b> have done." [...] After securing the role, she had vocal training and learned about the history of Argentina and Perón. During shooting she became ill several times due to the intense emotional effort required. However, as she told Oprah Winfrey, she was also pregnant during the filming: [...] "I was winded after every take. I had to lie on the couch every ten minutes so I could recover from dizzy spells, I was worried that I was shaking the baby around too much and that would injure it in some way." [...] Madonna wrote in her personal diary at the time: [...] "Ironically, this feeling of vulnerability and weakness is helping me in the movie. I'm sure Evita felt this way every day of her life once she discovered she was ill." ...|$|E
500|$|Spurs won the 1949–50 Second Division {{title with}} seven games to spare, scoring more goals and conceding fewer {{than any of}} their rivals, and were {{promoted}} to the First Division for the following season. In August 1950, shortly before Tottenham embarked on their first top-flight season since they had been relegated {{at the end of}} the 1934–35 campaign, Rowe told the club's annual meeting: [...] "As much as <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> <b>I</b> would rate our good time last year to the acquisition of Alf Ramsey." [...] After an uncertain start to the 1950–51 season, Spurs quickly recovered their form of the previous year and by Christmas were top of the table. Ramsey continued to play a key role, according to McKinstry playing [...] "the best football of his life": [...] "He was the master of strategy, the lynchpin of a side that built its attacks from the back, the scheming practitioner who put Rowe's plans into action." [...] His understanding of the game and authority on and off the field led to his teammates nicknaming him [...] "The General". On 28 April 1951, with a 1–0 home victory over Sheffield Wednesday, Tottenham were crowned champions of England only a year after promotion. [...] "I think fortune shone upon me very handsomely during the 1950–51 season," [...] Ramsey remarked in Talking Football—"After all, I was a member of one of the finest club teams in years".|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was no use}} in my coming," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "for, you see, I couldn't have {{accepted}} anything for what I did--I couldn't very well have done <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> could <b>I,</b> under the circumstances?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good, sir," [...] Godolphin said, with a grim smile. [...] "I {{must really}} {{compliment}} you all on your fertility of resource and invention. And now, is there <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that <b>I</b> {{can do for}} you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, ma'am,' said Bitzer, knuckling his {{forehead}} again, {{in return for}} the favour of Mrs. Sparsit's improving conversation. 'Would you wish a little more hot water, ma'am, or is there <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that <b>I</b> could fetch you?' ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{was above}} all {{influenced}} by Odd Man Out (1947) - [...] "I still {{consider it as}} one of the best movies I've ever seen and a film which made me want to pursue this career more than <b>anything</b> <b>else...</b> <b>I</b> always dreamt of doing things of this sort or that style. To a certain extent I must say that I somehow perpetuate the ideas of that movie in what I do." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{recording}} studio at Chorlton High School, {{one of the}} schools the brothers attended, commemorates Gibb. In honouring Gibb, his brother Barry Gibb noted: [...] "Mo was a real McCartney bass freak, {{as a lot of}} us were. He would pick up on all the things that McCartney would [...] Maurice was very good on different instruments, you know. Good lead guitarist, good bass player, good keyboard player. He was versatile. He loved playing bass more than <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> <b>I</b> think, at that time." ...|$|E
2500|$|It’s hard to {{say whether}} she’s a grand {{synthesis}} of all the pre-Raphaelite pictures ever made … whether she’s an original or a copy. In either case she’s a wonder. Imagine a tall lean woman in [...] a long dress of some dead purple stuff, guiltless of hoops (or of <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>I</b> should say) with a mass of crisp black hair heaped into great wavy projections on each of her temples … a long neck, without any collar, and in lieu thereof some dozen strings of outlandish beads.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is there <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that <b>I</b> can do {{for your}} comfort, as one who has been honoured by Titus, himself, our future emperor? You have but to express your wishes, and I shall be glad to carry them out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In half an hour's time, sir," [...] he said, [...] "I {{shall be}} going on {{business}} to Narrabee, our market-town here. Can I take any letters to the post for you? or is there <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that <b>I</b> {{can do in the}} town?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Must I {{answer that}} question? Ought I {{to be made}} to answer it? But I will tell you fairly, without {{touching}} on <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> that <b>I</b> feel that we are all disgraced, and that I will not take disgrace into another family." ...|$|R
2500|$|For many years, Beban was typecast as a French {{character}} actor. Beban later recalled, [...] "No {{one will}} ever know what an awful time I had {{to get away from}} French character. I had to live, and for French character parts I could name my own salary, but for <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>I</b> wasn’t worth as much as a chorus man." [...] No longer wishing to play parts that cast him as [...] "a Sunday comic supplement," [...] Beban begged to be given serious parts where he could portray a more rounded human being.|$|E
2500|$|Anderson played guitar for the {{experimental}} rock project Amps for Christ until the early 2000s. In 2006, she shaped the noise-folk band Gowns with The Mae Shi member and then-boyfriend Ezra Buchla. On February 5, 2010, Anderson announced the official disbandment of Gowns, which coincided with the ending of her personal relationship with Buchla. In the announcement, Anderson wrote [...] "We were tapping into some very raw emotions, and I'm ultimately proud of the risks we took. In spite of <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> <b>I</b> feel like we were honest, and I feel like we were brave." [...] She further commented that the band members [...] "haven't ruled {{out the possibility of}} future collaborations." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh {{were present}} at the {{coronation}} of her brother, Tsar Alexander III, in Moscow in May 1883. Their family was completed {{with the birth of}} a fourth daughter, Princess Beatrice, born at Eastwell on 20 April 1884. Years later, the Duchess lamented her failure to have more children: [...] "The only real heavenly moment is the birth of the child. This cannot be compared to <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> think if I had even a dozen children I would have kept the same feeling." [...] In July 1884, they traveled to Ilinskoe, outside Moscow, to visit Maria’s younger brother Grand Duke Sergei, who had married Queen Victoria’s granddaughter Elisabeth of Hesse.|$|E
60|$|As I spoke a {{particularly}} large ball of flame fell from above. It resembled a shooting star or a meteor more than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that <b>I</b> had ever seen, {{and made me}} wonder whether we were not perhaps standing beneath some inky, unseen sky.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can bear}} that;--though {{it is hard}} the having to go away and live among strange people. I think I shall get a farm somewhere, and see if I can take a lesson from you. <b>I</b> don't know <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that <b>I</b> can do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Annie; [...] "I haven't {{really been}} off our own place since I came. I've seen nobody but {{two or three}} old friends, and we {{naturally}} talked more about old times than <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> But <b>I</b> hear that there are great changes." ...|$|R
2500|$|Tré Cool's {{father was}} {{supportive}} and overhauled a bookmobile {{to transport the}} band. He would later say: [...] "I watched them go from {{a bunch of kids}} to a group of musicians with work ethic," [...] also adding: [...] "On their first tour or two, {{it was more of a}} party than <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> still scratch my head and say, 'How in the hell did they make it?' They used to practice in my living room here – a lot of the songs they did on Dookie. You hear it coming together, and you don't expect people are going to go out and buy it. But when it does, you just say, 'Wow that's so cool.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Various {{artists have}} cited Ege Bamyası as an influence. Stephen Malkmus of Pavement has been {{quoted as saying}} [...] "I played Can's Ege Bamyası album every night before I went to sleep for about three years." [...] Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth recalls, [...] "I found Ege Bamyası in the 49-cent bin at Woolworth's. I didn't see {{anything}} written about Can, I didn't know anything about them except this okra can on the cover, which seemed completely bizarre. I finally picked that record up, and I completely wore it out. It was so alluring. Something about it made Can seem to be playing outside of rock 'n' roll. It was unlike <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>I</b> was hearing at the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gouldman’s {{reputation}} as a hit songwriter {{attracted the attention of}} bubblegum pop producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz of Super K Productions, who invited him to New York to write formula bubblegum songs. In what he later called a [...] "creative lowpoint", Gouldman accepted. He recalled: [...] "They wanted me to write and produce for them, so I figured, why not? Nothing else was happening for me at the time. All told I worked for them for three or four periods {{over the course of a}} year, just writing and recording, and had no time for <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> <b>I</b> was totally involved in the whole Kasenetz-Katz thing while I was with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Strether debated; he {{took another}} turn. [...] "This last month I've been awaiting, I think, more than <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> the message <b>I</b> have here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I doubt it," [...] said Tom. [...] "An educated dog--that is, a trick dog--rarely knows <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> But, nevertheless, <b>I</b> think Wags remarkably bright." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to say}} anything," [...] said I, [...] "against what I {{have seen}} to-day, and I don't {{want to think of}} <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> while <b>I</b> am looking at it; but this I will say, that {{landscape}} with Scott is very different from landscape without him." ...|$|R
