5|$|The dispute {{lasted until}} 1753 and {{involved}} many of London's periodicals. It eventually resulted in countless essays, poems, {{and even a}} series of mock epic poems starting with Smart's The Hilliad.

5|$|It was to {{have been}} a five-week race, from 1 June to 5 July, with an entry fee of 20 francs. These {{conditions}} attracted very few cyclists: one week before the race was due to start, only 15 competitors had signed up. Desgrange then rescheduled the race from 1 to 19 July, increased the total prize money to 20,000 francs, reduced the entry fee to 10 francs and guaranteed at least five francs a day to the first 50 cyclists in the classification. After that, 79 cyclists signed up for the race, of whom 60 <b>actually</b> <b>started</b> the race.|$|E

5|$|Theobald's {{household}} {{included many}} young men of ability, including his successor Thomas Becket. Theobald {{was instrumental in the}} early spread of Roman law to England, inviting the Bologna-schooled jurist Vacarius to join his administration and advise on legal matters. Whether Vacarius <b>actually</b> <b>started</b> a school in Theobald's household is unclear, but in the 1140s he taught briefly at Oxford. Theobald was instrumental in fostering the teaching of canon law in England; the conflict that later arose between Henry II and Thomas Becket had its roots in disputes that were exposed during Theobald's time in office. While still in Normandy, Theobald had made an intense study of ecclesiastical or canon law, which he continued after being elected archbishop.|$|E
5|$|The war was {{accompanied}} by a media battle between Russia and Georgia. The Russian military brought Russian journalists to the combat zone to report news discrediting Georgia and portraying Russia as the saviour of Russian citizens in the conflict zone. Russia also aired television footage supporting its actions which had a strong effect on the local populations of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In a first for Russia, a Russian Armed Forces spokesman was provided by the Russian authorities to give television interviews about the war. Despite these tactics and domestic success, the Russian information campaign against Georgia was not successful internationally. In response to the information war, the Georgian government halted the broadcasting of Russian television channels in Georgia and blocked access to Russian websites. The information skirmishes between Georgia and Russia continued after armed hostilities had ended. According to political scientist Svante Cornell, the Kremlin spent millions in an international information campaign to blame Georgia for the war. Cornell writes that there is evidence, including some in Russian media, that Russia <b>actually</b> <b>started</b> the war.|$|E

25|$|Despite its success, {{numbers in}} service with the RFC <b>actually</b> <b>started</b> to decline from spring 1918, mainly {{due to a}} {{shortage}} of engines, and production switched to the DH.9, {{which turned out to}} be disappointing, being inferior to the DH.4 in most respects. It was left to the further developed DH.9A, with the American Liberty engine, to satisfactorily replace the DH.4.|$|E
25|$|The third {{canonical}} period, {{known as}} the Jus Novissimum ("newest law"), stretches from the Council of Trent to the promulgation of the 1917 Code of Canon Law which took legal effect in 1918.

Peters argues that the Jus Novissimum <b>actually</b> <b>started</b> with the Liber Extra of Gregory IX in 1234.|$|E

25|$|During the 1878–79 season Lord Harris' England team toured Australia. The {{feature of}} the {{tourists}} game against New South Wales at the SCG in 1879 was a riot sparked apparently when the crowd disagreed with an umpiring decision by George Coulthard that went against the locals. Lord Harris believed {{the invasion of the}} ground by about 2000 spectators was <b>actually</b> <b>started</b> by bookmakers in the stand. One of the umpires for the match was Edmund Barton, later to become Australia's first Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{definite}} {{record as}} to who gave the order to begin shelling the Four Courts. Historians have only presumed that it was Collins. There is only anecdotal evidence as to how and when the ultimatum was served on the anti-Treaty garrison, whether adequate time was allowed the Four Courts men to surrender, or whether shelling began precipitately while the garrison was loading up their arms to leave the building. Further study {{remains to be done}} on this most critical event of 1922, which <b>actually</b> <b>started</b> the Civil War in earnest.|$|E
25|$|In 1741, a {{supposed}} plot of arson was allegedly conducted by three enslaved men, Cuffee, Prince, and Caesar. These three men were {{alleged to have}} burned several buildings including the home of Lieutenant Governor George Clarke. Cuffee and Quack (Kwaku), were tried for arson, found guilty, and burned at the stake. In total 13 black men were burned at the stake, 17 were hanged along with four whites. 70 people were deported from New York. There is considerable historical debate as to how these fires were <b>actually</b> <b>started.</b>|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} events, the public {{prosecutor}} in Nîmes {{got to work}} to trace witnesses. He investigated 70, including 17 Italians, and opened 41 files leading to indictments against 17 accused, only eight of whom had previous criminal records. Charges were laid on 10 September and, {{at the request of}} the prosecutor, the Cour de Cassation agreed to hold the trials in Angoulême. Among the defendants was an Italian worker, Giordano, defended by M. Guillibert, a lawyer from Aix. The trial was due to open on 11 December 1893 but, due to the complexity of the case, it was not <b>actually</b> <b>started</b> until the 27 December.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{paperback}} houses {{that contributed to}} the decline of the genre–Ace, Dell, Avon, among others–were <b>actually</b> <b>started</b> by pulp magazine publishers. They had the presses, the expertise, and the newsstand distribution networks which made the success of the mass-market paperback possible. These pulp-oriented paperback houses mined the old magazines for reprints. This kept pulp literature, if not pulp magazines, alive. The Return of the Continental Op reprints material first published in Black Mask; Five Sinister Characters contains stories first published in Dime Detective; and The Pocket Book of Science Fiction collects material from Thrilling Wonder Stories, Astounding Science Fiction and Amazing Stories. But note that mass market paperbacks are not pulps.|$|E

25|$|Despite their name, Arabic numerals <b>actually</b> <b>started</b> in India. The {{reason for}} this misnomer is Europeans saw the numerals used in an Arabic book, Concerning the Hindu Art of Reckoning, by Mohommed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi. Al-Khwārizmī wrote several {{important}} books on the Hindu–Arabic numerals and on methods for solving equations. His book On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals, written about 825, along {{with the work of}} Al-Kindi, were instrumental in spreading Indian mathematics and Indian numerals to the West. Al-Khwarizmi did not claim the numerals as Arabic, but over several Latin translations, the fact that the numerals were Indian in origin was lost. The word algorithm is derived from the Latinization of Al-Khwārizmī's name, Algoritmi, and the word algebra from the title of one of his works, Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī hīsāb al-ğabr wa’l-muqābala (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing).|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{came out}} of the revolution as essentially bilingual (Czech and German) institution. In due course the university's support for the democratisation and the Czech National Revival brought retribution from the government in Vienna. In 1851, as the régime regained self-confidence, growing government intolerance of dissent and the subsequent decline in student numbers led to the closure of the Faculty of Philosophy. The Faculty of Law, which in 1849 had <b>actually</b> <b>started</b> teaching in the Czech language, was closed {{at the start of the}} 1855/56 academic year. In 1860 Emperor Franz Joseph I closed virtually the whole university. Only the independent Faculty of Theology and the independent University Library remained open, for nearly another eighty years, until, following the German invasion, all the Czech Universities were closed in November 1939. The School of Surgery also survived the emperor's decree in 1860, but closed in 1875.|$|E

It {{is true that the}} emperor intended it to be a strictly general or truly ecumenical council, at which the Protestants should have a fair hearing. He secured, during the council's second period, 1551–1553, an invitation, twice given, to the Protestants to be present and the council issued a letter of safe conduct (thirteenth session) and offered them the right of discussion, but denied them a vote. Melanchthon and Johannes Brenz, with some other German Lutherans, <b>actually</b> <b>started</b> in 1552 on the journey to Trento. Brenz offered a confession and Melanchthon, who got no farther than Nuremberg, took with him the Confessio Saxonica. But the refusal to give the Protestants the right to vote and the consternation produced by the success of Maurice in his campaign against Charles V in 1552 effectually put an end to Protestant cooperation.|$|E
