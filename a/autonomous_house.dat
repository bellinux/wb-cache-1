Since the death of Neale, there has been no single figure with authority across the entire Order. Several of these autonomous convents have dependent priories, which are smaller units of the Order, not having autonomous status, but whose sisters are under the authority of the Mother Superior of the 'parent' autonomous convent.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Irish cottage was the <b>autonomous</b> <b>house</b> {{for rural}} Northern Ireland between the 17 th and 19 th Centuries. Its form {{enhanced}} the beautiful Irish landscape {{and provided a}} holistic response to the occupants ’ requirements. The goal {{of this study was}} to design a contemporary alternative which would meet the expected comfort levels of the 21 st Century, but with lower energy consumption than current standard housing. The design develops through studies of the vernacular, deriving a series of design guidelines from the environmental attributes of traditional architecture. A further technical investigation of design for this climate with the materials available in the 21 st century derives an alternative series of design guidelines. The culmination of the study is the assimilation of the results of both investigations in a design which incorporates traditional and contemporary design and construction. The design developed following a rationale to reduce energy consumption and heat loss, maximise passive solar gains and generate energy...|$|E
40|$|Buildings are {{responsible}} for 40 % of the energy used globally as well as emit asmuch as one third of greenhouse gas emissions. With small but widespread changes to theway we build and use our buildings, the built environment could quickly reduce our impact onthe environment. In Sweden young adults are leaving higher education with an everincreasing limiting set of choices, the housing market has been outstripping inflation for over 20 years and the continuing deregulation of the housing markets, both private and municipalhas resulted in young adults returning home after their education has finished. Thereforethrough the design of buildings {{that are expected to}} last for at least 100 years there is a chanceto reduce our negative environmental impact and reduce the growing financial gap for youngadults, both important factors for sustainable developmentThe premise of the paper is to design a home for a small family that goes beyond greenbuilding standards of energy efficiency and takes into account the resource use and wasteproduction of the occupants. An <b>autonomous</b> <b>house</b> is identified and explored as the solution:a house that has no connections to the municipal systems that supply water and electricity northe municipal systems that deal with the waste produced by the occupants. This paper asks: Isan <b>autonomous</b> <b>house</b> possible in Sweden?

A final design is based upon the designmethodology A Pattern Language to develop and explore thoughts and ideas of the humanrequirements and the built environment’s interaction with nature. Given the length of timeallowed to produce this paper and to continue the narrative, the results of as-built home arealso presented and discussed. The final as-built solution thinks beyond the house as a singleentity and looks to the neighbourhood for solutions for resources that can be shared.

We have to transform and adapt them to a program that is completely alien compared to that {{for which they were}} intended, adapting them to a new constellation of de- sires. Yet, notwithstanding the wish for transformation, {{it is not possible to}} believe that these houses could transmute into something other from what they are now, that social housing could be converted into up-market suburban neighbourhoods, magically altering the assets of the residents as well. The requested housing density leaves no space for trees, hillocks, or gently meandering roads, and there will be no rise in property prices. Here, operation aurum ex stercore will not work. It is difficult to suppose a radical transformation of the area without presupposing a concurrent reworking of the entire city in which the area is inserted. Ultimately, it is simply a case of moving apartment residents into the most <b>autonomous</b> <b>houses,</b> and believing that this will be enough to improve the overall conditions of the residents. We ask ourselves what sense our work can have under these conditions. Can we propose a subdivision of lots capable of producing a city setting? Can we somehow defend Bakema’s building?

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu- Natal, Durban, 2004. Millions of Black South Africans still lack {{access to}} {{adequate}} housing, mainly {{as a result}} of apartheid era development policies. The delivery of low income, state subsidised, housing includes the provision of water, sewer drainage and electricity supply services. These services are provided via individual connections to the bulk infrastructure, or grid, supply network. Whilst this delivery mechanism meets community aspirations, it masks the environmental impact of this access to natural resources. This research investigates the low income housing delivery mechanism in South Africa, both past and present, and considers the associated infrastructural service delivery in the context of what is understood as sustainable development. In order to identify a more environmentally sustainable format of service delivery, the notion of <b>autonomous</b> <b>housing</b> is investigated. This investigative research establishes the body of knowledge in respect of rainwater harvesting and renewable energy sources capable of being harvested at a domestic level and uses this knowledge to inductively derive theoretical models for the provision of water and electricity supply as well as sewer drainage to low income housing in the Ethekwini Municipal area. The objective of the research is therefore to propose a more autonomous, or self reliant, system of service delivery that constitutes sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|Stephen E Hunt has {{produced}} the definitive account of Street Farm (Graham Caine, Peter Crump and Bruce Haggart), a London-based collective of anarchist architects working in the early 1970 s. The three friends put together Street Farmer, an underground paper that, alongside mutating tower blocks, cosmic tractors and sprouting one-way signs, propagated ideas for the radical transformation of urban living which they called ‘revolutionary urbanism’. Taking inspiration from Situationism and social ecology, Street Farm offered a powerful vision of green cities in the control of ordinary people. As well as writing and drawing, the group took part in street activism and squatting, were exponents of <b>autonomous</b> <b>housing</b> and radical technology and became rock ’n’ roll architects, going {{on the road with}} multimedia slideshow presentations to a recorded soundtrack of music by the likes of John Lennon and Jefferson Airplane. In 1972 Caine built and designed ‘Street Farmhouse’ with Haggart and other friends. It hit national and international headlines as the first structure intentionally constructed as an ecological house, appearing on an early BBC documentary introduced by a youthful Melvin Bragg. While their fame was brief, their ongoing influence on prominent green architects including Howard Liddell, Brenda Vale and Robert Vale and Paul Downton has been more enduring...|$|R
