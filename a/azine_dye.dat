40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a polymer composition, which contains or {{consists of a}} matrix {{of at least one}} thermoplastic polymer capable of crystallization and, incorporated therein, at least one <b>azine</b> <b>dye</b> and at least mono-, di-, tri-, and/or tetravalent metal salt. Said polymer composition is characterized in that the crystallization point thereof is considerably reduced in comparison with polymer compositions having no additives or a composition containing only an <b>azine</b> <b>dye</b> or a metal salt as an additive. The invention further relates to a corresponding additive composition for the crystallization and/or for the lowering of the crystallization point of thermoplastic polymers or polymer compositions capable of crystallization...|$|E
40|$|Ever since vagotomy {{became an}} im-portant part of modern peptic ulcer surgery, {{investigators}} have {{searched for a}} test that would reliably indicate the completeness of vagus nerve section. The insulin hypo-glycemia test, originally advocated by Hollander [8], has remained the most widely utilized test for the completeness of vagotomy, but despite several modifications it’s reliability has been questioned {{in a number of}} reports [6, 13, 141. In addition, the Hollander test has only postoperative application and cannot be used intraopera-tively. Two-deoxy-D-glucose (2 DG) is a potent vagal stimulant, causing an increase in gastric acid secretion greater than that produced by insulin-induced hypoglycemia [4]. The remarkable safety and low incidence of side effects associated with 2 DG have been fully investigated in other studies involving humans [4, 9, 121. Neutral red is an <b>azine</b> <b>dye</b> that is secreted by the gastric parietal cells into the stomach lumen [l], but only in the presence of intact vagal innervation to the stomach [lo]. Neu-tral red has likewise been shown to be safe for human use [7]. The present study is an attempt to use 2 DG and neutral red in combination as a test for completeness of vagotomy both in-traoperatively and postoperatively...|$|E
40|$|The syntheses of {{a number}} of azo and <b>azine</b> <b>dyes</b> with various surface {{attachment}} groups is described. The dyes use different methods of achieving surface complexing and are evaluated for their suitability as multiple labels for SERRS. The surface complexing agents, 8 -hydroxyquinoline, benzotriazole, and pyridine are both shown to form robust layers on the silver surface. The relative intensities of the SERRS signals from each dye were shown to be predictive by considering the molar absorption coefficient at the laser excitation frequency...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the {{modified}} electrodes, the resox and hydrolytic ferments, polymer semiconductors, phenothiazine, phenoxazines, phenazines, unorganic polycrystals, and polyelectrolites. The {{purpose of the}} work: {{the search for the}} new ways of conjugation of the fermentative and electrochemical reactions {{for the development of the}} ferment electrodes. The phenomenon of the direct electrocatalysis with hydrogenase has been studied; the new group of the electroactive polymers on the base of the <b>azine</b> <b>dyes</b> has been opened; the regeneration of the cofactors has been realized and the ferment electrodes on the base of the polymer azines have been created. The selfdoped polyaniline, electrochemically active in the neutral and alkali water solutions, has been synthesized. The selective catalyst of restoration of the hydrogen peroxide on the base of the dye blue has been synthesized. The method of the ferments immobilization in the water-not soluble polyelectrolites has been developed; the potentiometric biosensors with higher sensitivity habe been created on the base of polyaniline and amperemetric biosensors with high sensitivity and selectivity on the base of the dye blue have been created. The flow-injection analysis of glucose and ethanole, not depending on the presence of the reducers of the ascorbate and paracetamol type, has been developed.

40|$|In 1891 Guttmann and Ehrlich (P. Guttmann and P. Ehrlich, Berlin Klin. Wochenschr. 28 : 953 - 956, 1891) {{were the}} first to report the {{antimalarial}} properties of a synthetic, rather than a natural, material when they described the clinical cure of two patients after oral administration of a thiazine dye, methylene blue. Since that time, sporadic reports of the antimalarial properties of several xanthene and <b>azine</b> <b>dyes</b> related to methylene blue have been noted. We report here the results from a reexamination of the antimalarial properties of methylene blue. Janus green B, and three rhodamine dyes and disclose new antimalarial data for 16 commercially available structural analogs of these dyes. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations for the chloroquine-susceptible D 6 clone and SN isolate and the chloroquine-resistant W 2 clone of Plasmodium falciparum were determined by the recently described parasite lactate dehydrogenase enzyme assay. No cross-resistance to chloroquine was observed for any of the dyes. For the 21 dyes tested, no correlation was observed between antimalarial activity and cytotoxicity against KB cells. No correlation between log P (where P is the octanol/water partition coefficient) or relative catalyst efficiency for glucose oxidation and antimalarial activity or cytotoxicity was observed for the dyes as a whole or for the thiazine dyes. The thiazine dyes were the most uniformly potent structural class tested, and among the dyes in this class, methylene blue was notable for both its high antimalarial potency and selectivity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric method for {{the determination of}} nitrogen dioxide in air and nitrite in water, soil, some analytical grade chemicals and tooth paste has been developed. Nitrogen dioxide in air is fixed as nitrite ion in alka-line sodium arsenite or triethanolamine absorber solution. The method {{is based on the}} reaction of nitrite in aqueous medium with known excess of Neutral Red (C. I. 50040), an <b>azine</b> <b>dye</b> having a primary amino group with absorption maxima at 530 nm. In acid medium, it showed a decrease in colour intensity due to diazotization, followed by deamination. Addition of bromide ion enhances the rate of diazotization, and the reaction goes to completion almost instantaneously. Beer’s law is obeyed over the range 0 – 20 µg nitrite and the molar absorptivity is 2. 5 · 104 L mol– 1 cm– 1. The colour system is stable for 2 days. The dye can be extracted under alkaline condition in iso-amyl alcohol and the addition of methanolic sulphuric acid restores the dye colour. It showed molar absorptivity of 4. 3 · 104 L mol– 1 cm– 1. Beer’s law is obeyed over the range 0 – 1. 6 µg of nitrite, having a detec-tion limit of 0. 15 µg. Key words. Neutral Red – nitrogen dioxide – nitrite – nitrate – solvent extraction...|$|E
