40|$|The {{nature of}} {{transverse}} instabilities to dark solitons and dispersive shock waves for the (2 + 1) -dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation / Gross-Pitaevskii (NLS / GP) equation is considered. Special attention {{is given to}} the small (shallow) amplitude regime, which limits to the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation. We study analytically and numerically the eigenvalues of the linearized NLS / GP equation. The dispersion relation for shallow solitons is obtained asymptotically beyond the KP limit.

5000|$|The above {{atmospheric}} profile indicates several unusually favorable {{factors for}} development of severe weather, including tornadoes. One is these is significant vertical wind shear. The wind barbs on the right indicate significant speed and directional shear with height in the lower 500 mb of the atmosphere. Winds veer significantly, from SW at the surface to NW at 500 mb, and also increase from 8 kts at the surface to 46 kts at 500 mb, leading to a vertical shear value of 44 s −1. This exceeds the [...] "high potential" [...] severe weather threshold of 40 s −1. Veering winds with height indicate warm air advection; this, coupled with strong surface heating, contribute significantly to destabilization of the atmosphere. The second favorable feature on the plot is the steep vertical temperature gradient in the lower atmosphere up to the Lifted condensation level (LCL) - from 26.4 C at the surface (989 mb) to about −5 C at the LCL, which is about 600 mb. While the 600 mb height is unknown, {{it is likely that}} the atmospheric lapse rate is close to or exceeds the threshold for <b>absolute</b> <b>instability,</b> strongly driving convection. Air is therefore forced to rise rapidly, leading to a significant latent heat release (LHR), providing further energy for severe thunderstorms. Other strongly favorable conditions for severe weather are a highly negative (-6.1) lifted index (which exceeds the threshold of −6 for [...] "high potential" [...] of severe weather) and a CAPE value that peaked at 3.8 kJ, well over the threshold of 2.5 kJ for a high potential of severe weather. Vertical velocity at the surface is 13.6 m s −1, indicating strong rising motion.|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study has}} been undertaken {{of the influence of}} a compliant boundary on <b>absolute</b> <b>instability.</b> In a certain parameter range <b>absolute</b> <b>instability</b> occurs in the boundary layer on a rotating disc, thereby instigating rapid transition to turbulence. The conventional use of wall compliance as a laminar-flow control technique has been to lower growth rates of convective instabilities.

We show that a second order sensitivity analysis is effective to quantify and interpret the observed stabilizing effect. The global growth rates predicted by the second order expansion closely match those issued from a direct computation of the eigenvalues.
