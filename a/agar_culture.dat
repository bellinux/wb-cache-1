50|$|Petri first studied {{medicine}} at the Kaiser Wilhelm Academy for Military Physicians (1871-1875) and received his medical degree in 1876. He continued his studies at the Charité Hospital in Berlin and had active duty as a military physician until 1882, continuing then as a reservist. From 1877 to 1879 {{he was assigned to}} the Imperial Health Office (Kaiserliches Gesundheitsamt) in Berlin, where he became an assistant to Robert Koch. On the suggestion of Angelina Hesse, the New York-born wife of another assistant, Walther Hesse, the Koch laboratory began to culture bacteria on agar plates. Petri then invented the standard culture dish, or Petri plate, and further developed the technique of <b>agar</b> <b>culture</b> to purify or clone bacterial colonies derived from single cells. This advance made it possible to rigorously identify the bacteria responsible for diseases.|$|E
50|$|When {{grown on}} Sabouraud {{dextrose}} <b>agar</b> <b>culture</b> media, the fungus grows slowly as black, slimy, yeast-like colonies that reach {{a diameter of}} 2 mm after 14 days at 25 C. Then the colony centers develop a velvety texture and become greenish-gray and dome-shaped, while retaining a slimy and yeast-like margin. After 14 days, the ellipsoidal yeast-like cells are brown when stained with lactophenol cotton blue, and measure 6 by 3.5 µm. They have ringed zones that pinch off to create budding cells. The mycelia of the fungus are swollen and form torulose hyphae (swollen and constricted at intervals) that are pinched at their ends. When the colonies become velvety, the mycelia are not swollen, and conidia are formed in clusters. The average length of the conidiophores is about 10 µm. The conidia are oval to roughly spherical, and typically measure 3 by 2 µm.|$|E
50|$|Thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar, or TCBS agar, {{is a type}} of {{selective}} <b>agar</b> <b>culture</b> plate that is used in microbiology laboratories to isolate Vibrio secies. TCBS agar is highly selective for the isolation of V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus as well as other Vibrio species. TCBS agar contains high concentrations of sodium thiosulfate and sodium citrate to inhibit the growth of Enterobacteriaceae. Inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria is achieved by the incorporation of ox gall, which is a naturally occurring substance containing a mixture of bile salts and sodium cholate, a pure bile salt. Sodium thiosulfate also serves as a sulfur source and its presence, in combination with ferric citrate, allows for the easy detection of hydrogen sulfide production. Saccharose (sucrose) is included as a fermentable carbohydrate for metabolism by Vibrio species. The alkaline pH of the medium enhances the recovery of V. cholerae and inhibits the growth of others. Thymol blue and bromothymol blue are included as indicators of pH changes.|$|E

50|$|When {{grown in}} agar cultures, colonies are usually circular, 4.0 to 4.5 mm in diameter. Agar colonies usually have wide edges and an {{elevated}} center. They are commonly smooth with dull surfaces, and are yellow-orange pigmented {{in the center}} of the opaque colonies. They grow both in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, but tend to grow significantly less in the latter. Optimal NaCl concentrations of the <b>agar</b> <b>culture</b> for the growth of S. hominis seem to be around 7.5%, and a salt concentration of 15% yielded poor growth to no growth at all. The optimal growth temperature range was around 28 to 40°C, but good growth is still observed at 45°C, while no growth is observed at 15°C. S. hominis can be differentiated from staphylococci by its colony morphology and pigmentation patterns, predominant tetrad cell arrangement, poor growth in thioglycolate, low tolerance of NaCl, and carbohydrate reaction pattern. Each species is also significantly different in cell wall composition, lactic acid configuration, temperature extremes of growth, coagulase activity, hemolysis acetylmethylcarbinol production, nitrate reduction, and phosphatase, DNase, and bacteriolytic activities. Similarities in these properties between S. hominis and several other species suggest a close relationship between S. hominis and S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. warneri.|$|E
