However, she breaks up with Munch after the fish, a Jack Dempsey, ends up eating all her other fish. The now lonely Munch turns to Bolander for comfort, but finds the tables have turned and that Bolander has met a local waitress named Linda (Julianna Margulies). The two get <b>along</b> <b>very</b> well and bond over their mutual love of music. The episode ends with Linda and Bolander getting together to play music: Linda plays the violin, while Bolander plays the cello.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) {{is asked}} to visit the Dunder Mifflin {{branches}} to lecture about his success in Scranton. He and Pam (Jenna Fischer), who is coming along as his assistant and driver, plan to visit every branch except Nashua because Michael {{is not ready to}} face his ex-girlfriend Holly, who works there. They first visit the Utica branch, where former Scranton employee Karen (Rashida Jones) is now regional manager. Pam, who is engaged to Karen's ex-boyfriend Jim (John Krasinski), fears the encounter will be awkward. But Karen is now married and pregnant, and the two get <b>along</b> <b>very</b> well – when Pam reveals her and Jim's engagement, Karen even offers genuine congratulations. Michael's lecture in Utica proves to be a disaster when he tries to teach the employees a trick for how to memorize names and ends up insulting everybody. Nevertheless, Pam is ecstatic to have found closure with Karen. Later, on the road, Michael tells Pam that he never found closure with Holly and, at Pam's suggestion, they decide to blow off the other lectures and drive to Nashua to find Holly.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of general relativity is that it {{can be applied to the}} universe as a whole. A key point is that, on large scales, our universe appears to be constructed <b>along</b> <b>very</b> simple lines: all current observations suggest that, on average, the structure of the cosmos should be approximately the same, regardless of an observer's location or direction of observation: the universe is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. Such comparatively simple universes can be described by simple solutions of Einstein's equations. The current cosmological models of the universe are obtained by combining these simple solutions to general relativity with theories describing the properties of the universe's matter content, namely thermodynamics, nuclear- and particle physics. According to these models, our present universe emerged from an extremely dense high-temperature state –the Big Bang– roughly 14 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{successful}} conquest of Shu, Zhong Hui wrote {{a memorial to}} the Wei imperial court to report his contributions and urge the government to pacify and restore peace in Shu through benevolent governance.

25|$|He {{was part}} of the great {{movement}} for reform in the 15th-century French church. His approach was to reform the recruitment and education of the clergy, <b>along</b> <b>very</b> ascetic lines, heavily influenced by the hermit saint Francis of Paola. To this end he founded many colleges, all of them strictly controlled and dedicated to poor students with real vocations. Chief amongst them was the Collège de Montaigu, latterly part of the University of Paris. He lived at a time when this model of reform was under increasing pressure from more thoroughgoing critiques—including that of one of his most famous students, Erasmus.|$|E

25|$|When Benson was {{informed}} of the league's findings, he called in Payton and Loomis and ordered the program shut down immediately. However, {{they did not do}} so. Loomis had been interviewed during the 2010 investigation as well, and had stated that he knew of no such scheme and would stop it immediately if it was taking place. The league also found that Vitt, whom Payton had assigned to monitor Williams (the two reportedly didn't get <b>along</b> <b>very</b> well), also knew about the broader lines of the scheme and even witnessed Williams handing out payments to players. However, Vitt failed to tell anyone about it.|$|E

Aristides' two families lived in the same house for some time, but they did not get <b>along</b> <b>very</b> well, and four years later, Eurídice moved with her children to a small room behind a bar in São Paulo.

Throughout Genie's stay with the Riglers, Ruch persistently accused researchers of conducting harmful tests, deliberately forcing her mother out of her life, and misusing the available grant money, all of which the research team consistently and emphatically denied. Genie's mother steadily began listening more to Ruch, and eventually came to feel the research team was marginalizing her.|$|E

25|$|Despite early {{competition}} with the colony of Virginia to its south, and the Dutch colony of New Netherland to its north, the Province of Maryland developed <b>along</b> <b>very</b> similar lines to Virginia. Its early settlements and population centers tended to cluster around the rivers and other waterways that empty into the Chesapeake Bay and, like Virginia, Maryland's economy quickly became centered on the cultivation of tobacco, for sale in Europe. The need for cheap labor, and later with the mixed farming economy that developed when tobacco prices collapsed, led to a rapid expansion of indentured servitude, penal transportation, and forcible immigration and enslavement of Africans. Maryland received a larger felon quota than any other province.|$|E
25|$|At about 10.30 Mr. Alderman Gilpin, {{chairman}} of the company, and several other directors made their appearance, {{and a few minutes}} later the car, drawn by a couple of powerful horses, went sliding along Carrington-street to the Midland and nearly to the Great Northern Railway Stations. Pleased with the sight, the people ran {{by the side of the}} car and not a few hailed the conductor to stop and take them up. Having returned to the end of Station-street, the car was run along Arkwright-street to the Trent Bridge. Considering that the metals are new and not so clean as they will be kept in a few days, the car went <b>along</b> <b>very</b> pleasantly indeed.|$|E
25|$|In 1851, William {{returned}} to London {{with his wife}} and two children (Frederick and Louise), on the occasion of The Great Exhibition. For the first time, Victoria met her future husband and, despite the age difference (she was eleven years old and he was nineteen), they got <b>along</b> <b>very</b> well. To promote the contact between the two, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert asked their daughter to guide Frederick through the exhibition, and during the visit the princess was able to converse in perfect German, while the prince was only able to say a few words in English. The meeting was therefore a success, and, years later, Prince Frederick would recall the positive impression that Victoria made on him during this visit, with her mixture of innocence, intellectual curiosity and simplicity.|$|E

500|$|This {{method of}} {{recording}} caused conflicts to arise. Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote of Spector's obsessive techniques: [...] "Phil {{would sit in}} the control room and would listen through the headphones to Marky hit one note on the drum, hour after hour, after hour, after hour." [...] During the recording of [...] "Rock 'n' Roll High School", Johnny was forced by Spector to repeat his part hundreds of times {{over the course of several}} hours. Sire Records owner Seymour Stein relates: [...] "To Johnny, this must have been like the Chinese water torture." [...] "I understood [...] attitude," [...] said Marky. [...] "He was from The Bronx, I was from Brooklyn. We got <b>along</b> <b>very</b> well and had a nice rapport… But he had his way of working that was very slow, and the Ramones had their way of working which was very fast. So that would sometimes irk everybody, and led to animosity with Johnny and Dee Dee." ...|$|E

Sirtis described her character's relationship with Ziva as electric, explaining that she saw Orli as a counterfoil to Ziva's intensity and drive for vengeance. Their history, she believed, is [...] "kind of mind-blowing"; it provides an explanation for subplots introduced earlier in the episode. She clarified that Director Elbaz would not be a [...] "shrinking flower": [...] "She's kickass. She's strong. She's manipulative. She uses every weapon in her female arsenal.
