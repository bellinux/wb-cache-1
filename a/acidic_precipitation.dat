Line corrosion can occur if the drip edge of an inert roofing material rests directly on copper. A solution to this may be to raise the lower edge of the shingles with a cant strip, or to provide a replaceable reinforcing strip between the shingles and the copper.

In this work, the oxidation of As(III) to As(V) with ozone was carried out in an acidic solution.

40|$|Phosphotungstic acid (PTA) used at {{different}} concentrations in water was com-bined witis various compounds (amino acids, proteins, acid glycosaminoglycans, glycoproteins and simple sugars).

This study aims to investigate the removal kinetic and mechanisms of the mixed materials involved in the decolourisation of the dye to maximise their prospective applications for industrial wastewater treatment. The experimental results showed that dye removal was governed by combined physiochemical reactions of adsorption, ion-exchange, and precipitation. Ca-dye precipitation contributed over 70 % total dye removal, followed by adsorption and ion-exchange. The dye removal kinetic followed the pseudo-second-order expression and was well described by the Freundlich isotherm model. This study indicated pH was a key parameter to govern the removal mechanisms, i. e. adsorption/coagulation at <b>acidic</b> pH and <b>precipitation</b> at basic condition.

40|$|Plants, fungi, and {{bacteria}} enhance the oxalate-carbonate cycle in soils. Moreover, in temperate forests, it {{is related to}} mineral nutrient cycles including Ca and other elements such as Fe, Al and P (Cromack et al., 1977). Plants and fungi produce large amounts of calcium oxalate that are consumed by oxalotrophic bacteria as carbon and energy sources. So, the complete oxidation of oxalate salts releases carbonate and hydrogenocarbonate ions in the soil environment with a concomitant alkalinisation of the soil solution. If calcium is available, these conditions lead to the precipitation of secondary calcium carbonate (Braissant et al., 2004; Cailleau et al., 2005; Cailleau et al., 2004). Half of the organic carbon from oxalate is released as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the other half is transformed into mineral carbon (Verrecchia et al., 2006) with a residence time 10 to 100 longer than organic carbon (Retallack, 1990). Because salts are originally organic, the oxalate-carbonate pathway represents a potential major carbon sink (Cailleau et al., 2005) and probably acts as a regulator of the atmospheric pCO 2 (Verrecchia et al., 2006).

A 56 -year-old farmer was examined by the family doctor 1 h after voluntarily ingesting 500 mL of FIGHTER ~D (bentazon, 480 g/L water). He presented a Glasgow score of 15, polypnea, diarrhea, and vomiting. During transport by ambulance to the hospital, he tossed, sweated, and suddenly presented breathing difficulty followed by heart failure.

30|$|The {{process can}} be {{described}} {{in such a way that}} in the early diagenetic stage, an aerobic degradation of the accumulated organic matter generated large amounts of organic acids; due to the weakly <b>acidic</b> environment, no <b>precipitation</b> of carbonates was there. After depletion of the aerobic oxidation potential, the formed organic acids served as a substrate for fermentation by enzymes of anaerobic bacteria; this fermentation had to take place at temperatures below 50  °C. Organic acids contained both 12 C and 13 C, but those with isotopically lighter 12 C were consumed by bacteria first and CO 2 with 12 C was released. Due to this, organic acids with 13 C were concentrated in the organic matter. Simultaneously, the pH of the environment increased and carbonates and calcium oxalate monohydrate with 13 C were formed. Subsequently, the basal siderite matrix of the pelosiderite concretions was created and, in cracks of these concretions, ankerite and whewellite precipitated and crystallized. In the later diagenetic stage, during deeper burial, the remaining organic acids with a lower content of 13 C (and lower δ 13 C values) were thermally decarboxylated and formed carbonates with lower δ 13 C values crystallized in the peripheral parts of concretions. This crystallization took place at temperatures below 50  °C.|$|R

The air mass trajectory, surprisingly, explained the variability of only a small fraction of trace elements in precipitation water. The air mass origin area was correlated only with the concentrations of As, V and Cr. Wind directions were helpful in explaining the variability of Mn, U and Ba concentrations (east–north-easterly wind) and the contents of B, As, Rb, Se, Sr and Li in precipitation (south-westerly wind), which may indicate the local geological source of those.

Observations during the 1986 and 1987 water-years were used as base con-ditions. In 1986 snowfall in the Sierra Nevada was well above average, although chemical fluxes were lower than in 1987, which was a low-accumulation year. The chemical composition of stream water during the early part of snowmelt was sensitive to chemical loading in the snowpack and to snowmelt rate, both of which are subject to year-to-year natural variations and to anthropogenic perturbations. Stream-water chem-ical composition was also sensitive to uncertainties in the model, including rate of chemical release from the snowpack, nitrogen reactions, and flow routing in the catchment. The largest effects were limited to a period lasting up to a few days, coinciding with the ionic pulse in spring snowmelt. Some significant effects were also apparent during summer rains. Stream waters in late summer and fall were also affected by a faster snowmelt rate, primarily associated with soil drying and lower late-season streamflows.

40|$|The present {{contribution}} {{deals with}} {{the definition of the}} size/extent of major decay phenomena in the Venetian architectural surfaces caused by the impact of the local environment and its variation due to the effects of the climate changes occurred in the last years. Decay patterns observed on historical buildings and data related to the surrounding environment have been taken into account for evaluating the impact of climate changes on the built Cultural Heritage of Venice. This contribution aims to animate a network of Cultural Heritage stakeholders devoted to promote an effective and sustainable preservation policy. 1. Introduction The surfaces of built Cultural Heritage of Venice have been exposed in the last century to a particularly aggressive environment, not only related to the presence of brackish water and marine aerosol, but also due to the atmospheric pollution produced by the local industries and the extensive use of fossil-oils [1]. In recent years a better air quality has been assessed, however frequent and intense high tides and meteoric precipitations, enhanced by climate changes, and the lack of preservation and maintenance of the natural defences (e. g. barrier islands and coastal wetlands) make Venice Lagoon and its coasts progressively more vulnerable [1 - 4] [...] The impact of the climate changes on the historic architectonic surfaces in Venice is therefore of crucial importance {{for the development of a}} sustainable preservation plan for the Venetian Cultural Heritage. General models and data which relate climate changes and construction materials are available [5], but specific studies for more complex systems, such as historical centres, are still absent. Furthermore, the quantitative relationship between pollutant concentrations, meteorological variables and stone degradation is still difficult to clear out [6]. 2. Discussion: Effects of climate change on architectural surfaces in Venice Climate changes have exacerbated the well-known degradation factors present and intrinsic in the Venetian environment (e. g. the capillary rise of salt solution, the marine aerosol, etc.) and others related to the human overexploitation of the lagoon resources [6, 7]. The decay due to sulphatation, nitration and oxidation is expected to be reduced, thanks to the decrease of the associated pollutants [4], but erosion and washout processes - in particular for carbonatic materials - will continue and most probably increase due to the raise of CO 2 and <b>acidic</b> <b>precipitations</b> [1, 3, 5, 8]. In addition to air pollution, marine aerosol, often wrongly considered as a mere co-factor, is another important degradation factor since it induces surface roughness and crust formation [8]. The nowadays frequency and height of the tides are mainly responsible for enhancing the erosion effects due to water waves and rising damp within the buildings [1]. An emblematic situation is the SOCIETÀ CHIMICA ITALIANA Divisione di Chimica dell’Ambiente e dei Beni Culturali 11 narthex of St. Mark’s Basilica, flooded by tides ≥ + 80 cm SLM, which increased from an average of 43 times/year in 1983 - 1993 to 118 times/year in 2004 - 2014 [9]. 3. Final considerations For better understanding the peculiar situation in Venice in relation to the future climate changes, the integration and implementation of existing database are necessary. In this prospect, the selection of case studies and their monitoring over time should be promoted, together with an accurate research and standardization of old and ancient archive data, often not taken into consideration as not published or promoted by local stakeholders. This contribution will show some of the collected literature data and underline the difficulty of working with old and often not scientifically organised data.

Red mud is generated from alumina production where bauxite is digested in hot sodium hydroxide solution during the Bayer process. Red mud can contain considerable amounts of CRM such as rare earth elements (REEs). In the present study, purification of CRM from perturbing, co-extracted elements such as Fe and Al from red mud hydrochloric acid leachates was evaluated. RESULTS: A first purification was achieved by removing Fe (> 87 %) from the <b>acidic</b> leachate using <b>precipitation</b> with NaOH. REEs as well as Al were hardly removed by precipitation (21 %, and 33 %, resp.). A second purification was achieved using liquid/liquid extraction (LLE) with di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA). Here, four explanatory variables (i. e.

Finally, the optimal extraction conditions maximizing the economic potential (total metal extracted×economic value of the respective metal) of CRM were determined using a design of experiment approach. CONCLUSION: The experimentally determined economic potential extracted corresponded well to the prediction (88 %; to the predictions, maximum recovery of 17. 18 ± 0. 59 US $ t- 1).

In order to understand carbonate formation in such extreme environments, we have conducted a geo-biochemical study of Rio Tinto sediment, where carbonates are occurring, and laboratory culture experiments using a bacterial strain isolated from Rio Tinto. We show that carbonates can precipitate in environmental settings and in laboratory culture experiments with acidic to neutral solutions. A multi-technique approach including optical microscopy, SEM-EDS, AFM, TEM, XRD, carbon isotope analyses and Raman and Mössbauer spectroscopy demonstrate that Rio Tinto carbonates are related to microbial activity. Apparently, under <b>acidic</b> conditions, carbonate <b>precipitation</b> in Rio Tinto is microbially mediated by the neutralization of the solution because of the bacterial degradation of the organic matter and the reduction of ferric iron (Fe 3 +), as in the culture experiments occur. Bacteria change the physico-chemical conditions (e. g., Fe 2 +/Fe 3 +, pH) of their surrounding environment and overcome kinetic barriers to mineral precipitation (e. g., carbonates, sulfates, phosphates). The neutralization of Rio Tinto water occurs in regions where the sediment is rich in organic matter and ferric iron (Fe 3 +). Although, Mars surface sediments are devoid of organic matter, if life did emerge there, ancient sediments could have been much richer in organic matter than today, providing the carbon source for carbonate minerals precipitation. In conclusion, the formation of carbonates in the extreme environment of Rio Tinto could explain the occurrence of carbonates on Mars. Finally, this environmental and experimental study provides potential mineralogical biosignatures that may be useful to test life on Mars and other extraterrestrial habitats...|$|R

Geographical patterns of atmospheric Ca 2 +, Na +, Cl −, NH 4 +, NO 3 −, and SO 4 2 − {{were similar to}} wet deposition and attributed to anthropogenic sources, sea-salt emissions, and agricultural emissions. Decreasing trends in atmospheric NH 4 + (1994 – 2010) and SO 4 2 − (1983 – 2010) were prevalent. Atmospheric NO 3 − increased prior to 2001 and then declined afterwards. These {{results are consistent with}} SO 2, NO x and NH 3 emission trends in Canada and the USA. Widespread declines in annual NO 3 − and SO 4 2 − wet deposition ranged from 0. 07 to 1. 0  kg ha − 1  a − 1 (1984 – 2011). <b>Acidic</b> aerosols and <b>precipitation</b> impacted southern and eastern Canada more than western Canada; however, both trends have been decreasing since 1994. Scavenging ratios of particulate NH 4 +, SO 4 2 − and NO 3 − differed from literature values by 22  %, 44  %, and a factor of 6, respectively, because of the exclusion of gas scavenging in previous studies. Average gas and particle scavenging contributions to total wet deposition were estimated to be 72  % for HNO 3 and 28  % for particulate NO 3 −, 37  % for SO 2 and 63  % for particulate SO 4 2 −, and 30  % for NH 3 and 70  % for particulate NH 4 +...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{increased}} interest in modeling multicomponent reactive transport systems to investigate the mobility of toxic heavy metals in subsurface environments. In this study, a mathematical model was developed for understanding {{the fate of a}} typical heavy metal (lead) in unsaturated soils. Water movement in the soil was described by Richards equation which was modified to include a sink term for root water uptake. A convection-dispersion type model was utilized to determine the fate and transport of heavy metals, other accompanying ions, root exudates, and biomass. The transport model was coupled to a biogeochemical model that incorporated the important chemical and biological interactions between the heavy metal of interest and the carbonate and phosphate minerals, reactive sorption sites, organic acids, and microbial biomass in the soil. Local equilibrium assumption (LEA) was adopted, and the transport and biogeochemical models were externally coupled while solving for heavy metal transport. The model was used to simulate lead movement through unsaturated soils, with a typical plant root system, at the laboratory column scale. Model results were shown to compare satisfactorily with experimental data for lead, zinc, and calcium in saturated soil columns. Fate and transport of lead was strongly influenced by ion exchange process in <b>acidic</b> soils, while <b>precipitation</b> was the dominant process in neutral to alkaline soils. The model predicted the enhanced leaching of lead in the presence of citric acid by explicitly incorporating the geochemical reactions between the metals Pb, Ca, Fe and citric acid. In another application, immobilization of lead in the presence of biomass was found to be dependent on the growth of biomass which in turn, depends on the availability of root exudates in the rhizosphere. ...|$|R

40|$|Forests of {{the central}} and {{southern}} Sierra Nevada in California {{have been subjected to}} chronic damage by ozone and other atmospheric pollutants for the past several decades. Until recently, pollutant exposure of northern Sierra Nevada forests has been mild but increasing population and changes in land use throughout the Sacramento Valley and Sierra Nevada foothills may lead to increased pollutant damage in these forests. Although, better documented in other regions of the United States, little is known regarding the potential for <b>acidic</b> <b>precipitation</b> damage to Sierra Nevada forests. Only recently have studies directed towards understanding the potential interactive effects of ozone and <b>acidic</b> <b>precipitation</b> been undertaken. A key issue in resolving potential regional impacts of pollutants on forests {{is the extent to which}} research results can be scaled across genotypes and life-stages. Most of the pollution research to date has been performed using seedlings with varying degrees of genetic control. It is important to determine if the results obtained in such studies can be extrapolated to mature trees and to different genetic sources. In this paper, we present results from a one-year study examining the interactive effects of foliar exposure to acidic rain and ozone on the growth of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), a conifer known to be sensitive to ozone. The response to pollutants is characterized for both seedlings and mature tree branches of three genotypes grown in a common environment...|$|E

The Muskau Arc is a 40 km long moraine belt bent into a horseshoe-like shape {{pushed by}} the Mid Polish Glaciation, located in west Poland. Pyrite-bearing Neogene lignite {{deposits}} were mined there until the 1980 s. The abandoned open pits filled with groundwater are forming a set of reservoirs called "Anthropogenic Lake District". It consists of more than 100 reservoirs on the total area of more than 1500 square kilometers. Oxidation process of iron sulfide-containing lignite left in mining pits or deposited in dumps, exposed to atmospheric oxygen and water results in formation of <b>acidic</b> waters and <b>precipitation</b> of ochreous sediments. The water is characterized by high Fe and SO 42 - content. This chemical association with low pH waters is causing the main environmental waste problem in this region, which is typical for most Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) areas. The main goal of conducted experiment has been to examine the abilities of acid mine water remediation on the example of Muskau Arch lake named Africa. The chemical neutralization of acidic pH and removal of high salinity by precipitation was made by various substances application. The objective {{of this study was}} comparison of the potential effects of this treatments applied in several steps. Africa {{is one of the largest}} and deepest reservoirs of Muskau Arch. This meromictic lake has constant vertical stratification characterized by diversity of physicochemical parameters and content of major ions. Water contained in the mixolimnion at the top (down to about 10 m depth from surface) is well mixed by air currents and saturated with oxygen. It has lower pH (pH = 2. 75) and lower ion concentrations (the average TDS amounts to 2000 mg/L) than the bottom layer. Monimolimnion in the bottom part (below 10 m from the surface) is anoxic, poor in oxygen, with higher pH (pH = 4. 75) and salinity (TDS up to 6000 mg/L). Water in both layers is not mixing due to significant density difference preserving the geochemical stratification. In the set of laboratory experiments samples of waters from both layers were mixed with different doses of lime and lacustrine chalk. The application was carried out over half a year in several steps, because of the ability of this water to acidify itself. In all cases, especially in second stage, the treatments lead to rapid increase of pH and to precipitation of different secondary phases, mostly gypsum and iron hydroxides (ferrihydride, goethite and rare green rust). This results in removal of ferric and ferrous ions and reduction of sulfates content by close to 80 %. However effects was varying and depends on kind of treatment, layers, which have different acid neutralizing capacity, and step of dosing. pH of upper layer is lifted to about neutral value (7 - 8) by chalk dosing or slightly basic (9) in the case of liming. These treatments are successful already in first step application. Hydrogen ion releasing in iron hydroxides precipitation process in bottom layer, due to occurring specific pH-Eh conditions, restrains neutralization effectiveness. Therefore next application steps are necessary to reach neutral pH (6 - 7) after chalk treatment or even alkaline (11 - 12) by liming. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|The study {{objectives}} were {{to compare the}} changes of water chemistry of bulk precipitation, throughfall and stemflow for 3 types of forest stands, China-fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantation, secondary hardwood stand, and natural hardwood stand in Guandaushi Forest, in central Taiwan from January 1996 to December 1998. Annual bulk precipitation had an average pH of 4. 05 and stemflow of China-fir plantation was little more <b>acidic</b> than bulk <b>precipitation,</b> but throughfall of China-fir plantation almost maintain the same pH as in bulk precipitation. The pH values in throughfall and stemflow of secondary hardwood and natural hardwood {{were significantly higher than}} in bulk precipitation. It indicated that canopies and stems of hardwoods showed a high capacity to buffer the acidity of precipitation by accompanied with leaching and washing large amounts base cations. The conductivity in throughfall and stemflow of three stands were higher than in bulk precipitation. Most ion concentrations in throughfall and stemflow also showed higher values than in bulk precipitation except for H, F, Na and HCO 3 in stemflow of China-fir plantation. The enrichment factors were from 1. 50 to 64. 49 in different ions, especially K, Ca, Mg, and HCO 3 substantially increased in throughfall and stemflow of secondary and natural hardwood. Under three stands, H had a negative net canopy exchange (NCE) attributable to acid neutralization in the canopies and stems, especially in secondary and natural hardwood. K, Ca, and Mg had a positive NCE due to canopy and stem leaching and washing, especially K. A comparison of NCE of inorganic anions in three stands showed that Cl, NO 3 -N, and SO 4 -S had higher positive values in China-fir plantation than in secondary and natural hardwoods, while HCO 3 had a highest positive value in natural hardwood. Regression analysis of single-event data showed that the most important factor regulating the event-to-event variation in net throughfall fluxes was the amount of precipitation, suggesting that canopy exchange (leaching and uptake) regulated the net throughfall fluxes for most ions. Duration of the interevent dry periods (dry deposition) was highly siginificant in most base cation fluxes for throughfall, especially in China-fir plantation, suggesting a higher scavenging efficiency of the needles for dry deposition. The mean DOC concentration in bulk precipitation was 4. 7 mg/L. However the rain passing through the tree canopies and barks as throughfall and stemflow, the mean concentrations were 7. 0 and 30. 8, 9. 9 and 10. 0, and 8. 3 and 7. 2 mg/L in China-fir plantation, secondary hardwood, and natural hardwood, respectively. Significant correlation between DOC and charge balance deficit was observed, indicating that organic ions would contribute to the charge balance in the three stands. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic acids were the dominant fractions in bulk precipitation, throughfall and stemflow of three stands, accounting for ~ 90 % of total DOC. However, differences in DOC fractions were found between bulk precipitation and throughfall or stemflow. In bulk precipitation, hydrophilic DOC were the dominant fraction but hydrophobic DOC were rich in throughfall and stemflow, indicating that these DOC fractions were altered when bulk precipitation were through canopies and stems. The elemental compositions of both humic polymers (MW> 1000) and FAs (MW> 1000), which were isolated from the water samples of throughfall and stemflow, were in the ranges typical for humic substances from other origin. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) pectra also were close to the characteristics of reported humic substances. The results showed that the humic polymers (MW> 1000) and FAs (MW> 1000) in the water samples of throughfall and stemflow, which were above ground and soil mediation free environments, and in canopies and stems, may be a new pathway of formation as well as humification of humic substances. The occurrence and function of the humic substances in the water samples from various origins in forest ecosystem thus can not be overlooked. 本試驗的目的主要在探討雨水及比較雨水流經不同林分後水質之變化。樣區設於惠蓀林場關刀溪支流之一小集水區，在此集水區內除收集林外雨外，並於相鄰的杉木林、次生闊葉樹林及天然闊葉樹林三種不同林分內收集穿落水和幹流水，以比較雨水及雨水流經此三種不同林分後水化學的變化。資料採用時間為 1996 年 1 月至 1998 年 12 月。 三年試驗期間，林外雨的pH平均為 4. 05 ，杉木林幹流水的pH比林外雨低，穿落水則略高，而天然林和次生林則不論穿落水或幹流水皆比林外雨顯著高出甚多，顯示闊葉樹林對林外雨具有較高之中和能力，但卻會增加除H外之其他鹽基陽離子（Na, K, Ca, Mg）的濃度及輸入量。當雨水通過林冠及樹幹到達林地後，電導度值明顯增加，尤其是杉木林的幹流水增加最多。此三種林分的穿落水及幹流水的無機離子濃度除H, F, Na及杉木林幹流水的HCO 3 外，皆顯著增加，其增多係數（enrichment）由 1. 50 到 65. 49 不等，其中以K, Ca, Mg及HCO 3 增加較為明顯。 若以淨林冠交換量（net canopy exchange, NCE）而言，H在三種林分皆有被林冠保留現象，其保留情形以次生林及天然林較杉木林明顯。K, Ca, Mg皆是釋出，尤其是K的釋出為最大量。陰離子方面，Cl, NO 3 -N及SO 4 -S釋出都是以杉木林最多，次生林次之，天然林最少。HCO 3 的釋出則剛好相反。 以穿落水淨輸入量當應變數，雨量、降雨間隔日數（乾沉降）、林外雨氫離子濃度和林外雨成份離子濃度當作自變數，以每場雨的資料推導迴歸方程式，分析的結果顯示與各成分離子輸入量顯著關係最高的是雨量，因此，雨量是影響雨水穿過此三種林分冠層後，離子輸入量的最重要因子。降雨間隔日數和大部分穿落水陽離子的淨輸入量，也都存有高度相關，尤其是杉木林，此結果證明杉木林對乾沉降的攔截能力。 林外雨之可溶性有機碳（dissolved organic carbon, DOC）平均濃度為 4. 7 mg/L，而杉木林、次生林及天然林的穿落水濃度分別為 7. 0, 9. 9 及 8. 3 mg/L，幹流水則分別提高到 30. 8, 10. 0 及 7. 2 mg/L，以杉木林增加最為顯著，顯示雨水流經此三種不同林分冠層後，DOC和上述的養分離子一樣，濃度皆增加。DOC的測定結果與水樣陰離子缺乏所作的迴歸分析，顯示陰離子的缺乏主要來自DOC。 DOC的特性方面，林外雨以親水性酸佔大部分，但穿落水及幹流水則以疏水性酸佔大部分。表示雨水經過冠層後，所含的有機酸成分已有明顯改變。另由羧酸濃度、元素分析百分比及FTIR圖譜等之DOC的特性分析顯示，雨水及通過林冠之穿落水或幹流水皆有腐植化現象，惟林外雨腐植化程度低，但三種林分的穿落水及幹流水已有明顯腐植化現象，證實腐植化物質的形成及腐植化過程在林分冠層或樹體中亦進行著。封面 摘要 Summary 目錄 表目次 圖目次 壹、前言 貳、前人研究 一、雨水的分配 二、無機養分離子 (一) 雨水水化學 (二) 穿落水水化學 (三) 幹流水水的化學 三、可溶性有機碳(DOC) 參、材料與方法 一、樣區位置 二、水樣種類與收集 (一) 降水的收集 (二) 穿落水的收集 (三) 幹流水的收集 三、水樣化學分析 (一) pH、電導度、懸浮質、無機陰陽離子及有機陰離子 (二) DOC的測定 (三) DOC分離與特性分析 1. 中和酸的能力的測定 2. 親水性與疏水性物質的測定 3. 羶羧含量的測定 4. 灰分測定及元素分析 5. 傅立葉轉換紅外線光譜分析 (四) 腐植化聚合物 四、資料的處理與分析 肆、結果 一、養分濃度的變化 二、水量及無機養份的輸入量 (一) 降水量、穿落水量及幹流水量 (二) 離子的輸入量 (三) 離子輸入亮的季節變化 (四) 離子的淨輸入量 三、可溶性有機碳(DOC) (一) 陰離子缺乏和DOC的關係 (二) DOC濃度的變化與輸入量 (三) DOC濃度的季節變化 (四) DOC的特性 伍、討論 一、離子濃度及輸入亮 (一) 降水 (二) 穿落水 (三) 幹流水 (四) 離子的淨輸入量 (五) 影響穿落水離子淨輸入變異的原因 二、水中溶解碳(DOC) 的化學 (一) DOC對水樣離子平衡的貢獻 (二) DOC在三種林分的差異及季節變化 (三) DOC在分離與特性分析 陸、結論 柒、引用文...|$|R
