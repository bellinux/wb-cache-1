40|$|This study {{investigated}} menstrual regularity, disordered eating, body composition {{in a group}} of female <b>athletes,</b> a <b>s</b> well as the differenc e between body composition and disordered eating in irregular vs normal menstruating athletes. Participants were Caucasian female athletes (n= 46), 14 – 25 years, 53. 75 ± 8. 55 kg and 164. 85 ± 7. 93 cm were recrui ted and subdivided into three groups based on level of performance (i. e. Beginners, Intermediate and Advanced). They completed self-administered questionnaires on menstrual history, eating attitude (EAT- 26) and disordered eating behaviour (EDI). Body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography. Results indicated that beginner athletes had a younger menarcheal age than both intermediate (12. 95 vs. 14. 00 and 14. 33 yr, d = 0. 8, respectively) and advanced <b>athlete</b> <b>s,</b> and a higher body fat percentage than intermediate athletes (20. 44 ± 4. 18 vs. 16. 29 ± 4. 57 %, d = 0. 8, respectively). Of the total group 2. 17 % had primary amenorrhea, 21. 74 % secondary amenorrhoea and 8. 70 % oligomenorrhoea. Of all the athletes, 10. 7 % used oral contraceptives to regulate their menstrual cycles. There was a low risk for disordered eating amongst all the athletes even though 28 % reported a history of eating binges, 9 % reported to have vomited before to control weights, and 31 % used diet pills and laxatives for weight control. No differences were found between body composition and disordered eating in irregular and normal menstruating athletes. It was concluded that menstrual irregularities are present in this group of <b>athlete</b> <b>s</b> and some showed signs of extreme weight-control behaviour. This places them at a high risk of developing two components of the female athlete triad namely funct ional hypotha lamic amenorrhea and low energy-availability with or without an eating disorder.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis is comprised of four studies. The first study aimed to examine the measurement invariance of the Coach-Athlete Relationship Questionnaire (11 -item, athlete version CART-Q) employing a total of 1, 363 athletes from Belgium (n = 200), Britain (n = 382), China (n = 200), Greece (n = 115), Spain (n = 120), Sweden (n = 169), and the United States of America (n = 177). Multi-group mean and covariance structure (MACS) analyses supported the factorial validity of the CART-Q in a three-first order factor model across the seven countries. An examination of the latent mean differences of the CART-Q revealed {{that there are some}} variations in terms of the intensity athletes perceive in the quality of the relationship with their coach across the different countries. Overall, these results supply additional evidence of the psychometric properties of the CART-Q and highlight that it is a sound instrument that can be applied cross-culturally. The second study attempted to identify the cultural nuances that exist in Chinese coach-athlete relationships from an derived-emic perspective. Eight-hundred Chinese coaches and athletes completed the long and short versions of the CART-Qs. Results supported the reliability across the CART-Q versions examined, while confirmatory factor analyses only supported the factorial validity of the three-first order factor model of the 11 -item CART-Q. The findings indicated that the corresponding aspect of complementarity may not best capture the Chinese coach-athlete behavioural interactions. Thus, it suggested that future research should consider conceptualising and measuring the coach-athlete reciprocal interactions in terms of coaches dominant behaviours and athletes submissive behaviours within Chinese sports context. The third study examined the nomological validity of the 11 -item CART-Qs with 350 Chinese coach-athlete dyads. Big-Five personality traits and relationship satisfaction were employed as the criterion variables of coach-athlete relationships. Results revealed: (a) actor effects of personality traits, namely, conscientiousness, extroversion, and neuroticism, on both coaches and athletes perceptions of relationship quality and (b) partner effects of only athletes personality, namely, conscientiousness, extroversion, and neuroticism, on their coaches perceptions of relationship quality. The findings suggested that each relationship member s personality trait contributed independently to relationship quality, because no interaction effects of the coach <b>s</b> and the <b>athlete</b> <b>s</b> personality traits on relationship quality were found. In addition, the findings also supported both actor and partner effects of the coach <b>s</b> and the <b>athlete</b> <b>s</b> perceptions of relationship quality on their satisfaction with training. Based upon the relevant theory and findings generated from the previous three studies, the fourth and final study aimed to fill the gap in the relevant literatures by expanding the construct of complementarity to include coach-athlete reciprocal behaviours, namely the coach s dominant and the <b>athlete</b> <b>s</b> submissive behaviours. Study 4 included 4 phases reflecting the process undertaken to develop and validate the Dominant-Submissive Behaviours Scales. Phase 1 generated a pool of items based on the relevant literatures and feedback from the coaches and athletes; these items were then assessed by three panel groups including academic experts, coaches and athletes. In phase 2 and phase 3, confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the construct validity, nomological validity, and internal reliability of the developed scales. As a result, the 10 -item coach s dominant behaviour scale and the 10 -item <b>athlete</b> <b>s</b> submissive behaviour scale were derived. Phase 4 employed athletes from five different countries to assess the cross-cultural validity of the submissive scale, and results supported the full structural invariance of the <b>athlete</b> <b>s</b> submissive behaviour scale across the five countries. Overall, results confirmed the dominant-submissive scale is a valid measure for assessing another dimension of complementarity in coach-athlete relationships. Collectively, this thesis has expanded the current knowledge of coach-athlete relationships to a broader social-cultural context by recruiting coaches and athletes from eight different countries across two continents. It is therefore plausible to conclude that the conceptualisation of the 3 + 1 Cs model and the CART-Q seem to be universal across diverse cultures at a generic level. However, future research needs to continue discovering the universals as well as the variations of human behaviours in the content and the quality of coach-athlete relationships.

The footpads follow the prerecorded motion of the feet of healthy individuals. For gait training, the patient progresses sequentially through successively more advanced modes. In this study, two modes, the enforced climbing of stairs and interactive climbing of stairs, were developed. In the interactive mode, foot pressure sensors are used to realize interactive walking. Comparisons were made between the modes for healthy individuals and a patient. The effectiveness of the system was examined using electromyography (EMG) and foot pressure data...|$|R
40|$|ATHLETE {{is a large}} six-legged tele-operated robot. Each foot is a wheel; travel can be {{achieved}} by walking, rolling, or some combination of the two. Operators control ATHLETE by selecting parameterized commands from a command dictionary. While rolling can be done efficiently with a single command, any motion involving steps is cumbersome - walking a few meters through difficult terrain can take hours. Our goal is to improve operator efficiency by automatically generating sequences of motion commands. There is increasing uncertainty regarding <b>ATHLETE</b> <b>s</b> actual configuration over time and decreasing quality of terrain data farther away from the current position. This, combined with the complexity that results from 36 degrees of kinematic freedom, led to an architecture that interleaves planning and execution at multiple levels, ranging from traditional configuration space motion planning algorithms for immediate moves to higher level task and path planning algorithms for overall travel. The modularity of the architecture also simplifies the development process and allows the operator to interact with and control the system at varying levels of autonomy depending on terrain and need...|$|R

40|$|The ankle foot {{orthotic}} (AFO) {{has been around}} for centuries. They were created to augment functionality of an ankle damaged due to injury or disease. A common reason a patient might be prescribed an AFO is a condition called foot drop. Foot drop can be caused by many conditions, but the most common reason is a stroke. Foot drop can be characterized by the inability to raise and/or lower a patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot.</b> This incapacitation of the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot</b> leads to unnatural gaits and joint fatigue, as well as increasing the patient 2 ̆ 7 s likelihood of tripping and becoming seriously injured. Hard plastic AFOs that hold a patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot</b> in a neutral position are the current standard for combating foot drop. These AFOs come in many different shapes and sizes, which emphasizes the wide variety in functionality of someone with foot drop. Unfortunately, the restrictive nature of the AFO can cause unnatural movements in the patient 2 ̆ 7 s foot; these unnatural tendencies are more exaggerated when walking down stairs and ramps, as the natural gait is to land toe first, the opposite of what the brace allows the patient to do. The purpose of this project is to create a sensor system for an AFO to help identify varying terrain. In the future this information can then be made to control an active AFO. Each terrain type will be first measured by a pair of simple infrared range finder, attached on the lower leg, one range finder looks ahead of the user and the other looks straight down at the ground. Models for the ground conditions can be established by representing each with Fourier series created using RANdom Sample Consensus (RANSAC). RANSAC coefficients will be scaled off the rate of data coming in and gait speed. Each model has a period term so the data can easily be scaled to match the pattern of walking regardless of pace. Gait speed will be measured using the downward facing ankle-mounted rangefinder, but with a threshold to determine when the foot is in contact with the ground. Once this initial set-up is completed, the system can take in data live and provide a prediction of the type of ground the patient is walking over, using pattern recognition techniques. The hope for this project is that if the system can accurately predict the change in ground type from, for example, level walking to walking down a ramp, an AFO could then be made to adjust itself, giving the patient a more natural gait, even when encountering adverse conditions. A byproduct of constantly using a patient 2 ̆ 7 s own gait to measure ground type is the ability to track a patient 2 ̆ 7 s changing gait over time, giving therapists a valuable new tool for tracking progress in a patient...|$|R

Two groups of amateur <b>s</b> <b>athletes</b> (floorball players) were examined during the study - intervention group(n = 16, average height = 178, 23 cm (std 7, 18), average weight = 80, 04 (std 11, 53), average age = 25, 15 years (std 3, 31)) and control group(n = 8, ave- rage height = 181, 48 cm (std 5, 59), average weight = 82, 29 kg (std 11, 20), average age = 27, 07 let (2, 68)). Each participant underwent the entrance measurement both on Footscan to evaluate the level of postural stability by selected parameters and on InBody 3. 0 a Tanita to evaluate the level of body composition by selected parame- ters. Then the intervention group took part in the intervention exercise. After the six week intervention period underwent both groups the second measurement. The results of both measurements were evaluated, compared and statistically analyzed. Results The results showed great [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Leg-hold traps are an {{important}} tool in selectively capturing coyotes (Canis latrans) causing agricultural depredations. Because animals captured in leg-hold traps may incur injury and trauma {{to their feet and}} legs, there has been growing opposition to use of such traps. Each year, state or federal legislation is proposed to restrict the use of traps and considerable research effort has been devoted to the examination of trap improvements or alternatives. A variety of trap modifications have been suggested to reduce foot injuries and make the technique more generally acceptable, including use of padded jaws (Linhart et al. 1986, Olsen et al. 1986, Linhart et al. 1988) or attachment of tranquilizer tabs to traps (Balser 1965, Linhart et al. 1981). A tranquilizer tab consists of a measured amount of tranquilizer in some form of small pouch or nipple attached to the trap jaw. When a coyote is captured in a tranquilizer tab-equipped trap, it chews on the tab and ingests {{some or all of the}} tranquilizer, resulting in reduced: 1) anxiety, 2) struggling, and 3) secondary injuries to the coyote 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot</b> and leg. In addition, tranquilization may (4) serve to improve trap efficiency by reducing escapes...|$|R
40|$|Geckos have {{extraordinary}} wall-climbing ability {{because of}} the millions of hairs with micro/nano fibrillar structures on their feet. Mimicking gecko 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>feet</b> is of scientific and engineering importance for development of physical adhesion materials and devices. The design of gecko-inspired physical adhesives seems to be geometry dominated. In this study, Finite Element Method (FEM) has been used to analyse the vertical peel-off force of polyporpylene (PP) nanofibres having different fibre dimensions, inclining angels and contact areas on a flat glass substrate. It has been found that the main parameters affecting the frictional adhesion are fibre diameter and fibre aspect ratio, the inclining angle between the fibre and the substrate surface, and the intimate contact areas. Our analysis has shown that PP nanofibres with a diameter of less than 200 nm can generate less peel-off force than fibres of larger diameters, indicating more stable adhesion with the glass substrate for thinner fibres. A bent fibre with more intimate contact area can bear more shear force than a straight fibre with less contact area. Also, under the same shear loading, fibres with an inclining angle of less than 30 ° provide a low peel off force. </p...|$|R
