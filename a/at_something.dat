5|$|Over {{the next}} four seasons, Yorkshire failed to win the Championship, {{although}} they never finished lower than fourth in the table. The team displayed an unaccustomed weakness in bowling, particularly {{after the death of}} Roy Kilner in 1928. The effectiveness of the main bowlers was reduced by age and injury; only Macaulay remained <b>at</b> <b>something</b> approaching his bowling peak. However, his performances worsened each year. His bowling figures in the 1927 season were similar to his achievements in 1926, showing only a slight decline, but his total of wickets fell each season until 1930.|$|E
5|$|Henry Fuseli {{would later}} create {{one of the}} more famous portrayals of the Three Witches in 1783, {{entitled}} The Weird Sisters or The Three Witches. In it, the witches are lined up and dramatically pointing <b>at</b> <b>something</b> all at once, their faces in profile. This painting was parodied by James Gillray in 1791 in Weird Sisters; Ministers of Darkness; Minions of the Moon. Three figures are lined up with their faces in profile in a way similar to Fuseli's painting. However, the three figures are recognisable as Lord Dundas (the home secretary at the time), William Pitt (prime minister), and Lord Thurlow (Lord Chancellor). The three of them are facing a moon, which contains the profiled faces of George III and Queen Charlotte. The drawing is intended to highlight the insanity of King George and the unusual alliance of the three politicians.|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of the {{campaign}} went well, with John outmanoeuvring the forces under the command of Prince Louis and retaking the county of Anjou by the end of June. John besieged the castle of Roche-au-Moine, a key stronghold, forcing Louis to give battle against John's larger army. The local Angevin nobles refused to advance with the king; left <b>at</b> <b>something</b> of a disadvantage, John retreated back to La Rochelle. Shortly afterwards, Philip won the hard-fought battle of Bouvines in the north against Otto and John's other allies, bringing an end to John's hopes of retaking Normandy. A peace agreement was signed in which John returned Anjou to Philip and paid the French king compensation; the truce was intended to last for six years. John arrived back in England in October.|$|E

5|$|When he played, Bates stood <b>at</b> , <b>something</b> that {{teammates}} taunted him about: in Milwaukee {{spring training}} camp, players threw {{a cap on}} the ground and addressed {{it as if it were}} Bates. During the MLB off-season, he worked as a substitute school teacher in Houston. Before the World Series, Bates raced against an unchained cheetah in a promotional event for the Cincinnati Zoo at Riverfront Stadium. The premise of the event was to show that a cheetah could defeat a human (with a five-second head start) in a 100-yard race. The cheetah was supposed to chase a toy, but about halfway through the race, Bates' hat fell off, and instead, it went after the hat; Bates won the race. In 2000, the University of Texas inducted him into their Men's Athletics Hall of Honor. , Bates lives in Houston and works for an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry. He also coaches his daughter's softball team outside of work.|$|E

25|$|Many writers, {{including}} Lactantius, Cyprian of Carthage, Augustine, Marsilio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Giordano Bruno, Campanella, Sir Thomas Browne, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, considered Hermes Trismegistus to be a wise pagan prophet who foresaw {{the coming}} of Christianity. St. Thomas Aquinas reported that Trismegistus arrived <b>at</b> <b>something</b> akin to {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity.|$|E

25|$|The {{spinning}} sensation experienced from BPPV {{is usually}} triggered by {{movement of the}} head, will have a sudden onset, and can last anywhere from {{a few seconds to}} several minutes. The most common movements patients report triggering a spinning sensation are tilting their heads upwards in order to look <b>at</b> <b>something,</b> and rolling over in bed.|$|E
25|$|Jaypaw {{is upset}} that he can't compete, and while staying behind at the camp, {{he has a}} vision. He is choking on earth, and he smells badger and fox. He is scrabbling desperately with his paws, until realizes that he is seeing through Lionpaw's eyes. It turns out that, while competing, Lionpaw and Breezepaw fell into a {{collapsing}} fox den. Luckily, Jaypaw got there in time to save them along with Crowfeather. The leaders decide that since every Clan won <b>at</b> <b>something,</b> {{there would be a}} tie and no Clan would win.|$|E
25|$|Several {{people have}} pointed out more or less {{significant}} areas where Lewis' Outline is {{not consistent with the}} text of The Chronicles. Paul Ford, author of Companion to Narnia, points out that the text of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe states that Lucy and Edmund are one year apart in age, the years given in the timeline for their births, 1930 and 1932 respectively, would put their ages <b>at</b> <b>something</b> more than a year. Devin Brown, author of Inside Narnia: A Guide to Exploring The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, uses the timeline as a way to reconcile some of the statements concerning the timing of Aslan's appearances in Narnia with other characters' recollection of those appearances.|$|E

25|$|After the screening, the {{two couples}} stayed outside the theatre {{for a while}} but {{separated}} about 23:15. Olof and Lisbet Palme headed south {{on the west side}} of Sveavägen, towards the northern entrance of the Hötorget metro station. When they reached the Adolf Fredrik Church, they crossed Sveavägen and continued on the street's east side. They stopped a moment to look <b>at</b> <b>something</b> in a shop window, continued past the Dekorima shop which was then located on the corner of Sveavägen and Tunnelgatan, and headed for the metro station entrance on the other side of Tunnelgatan. At 23:21, halfway across the street and only a few metres from the station entrance, a man appeared from behind, shot Mr. Palme at point-blank range and fired a second shot at Mrs. Palme. The perpetrator then jogged down Tunnelgatan street, up the steps to Malmskillnadsgatan and continued down David Bagares gata , where he was last seen.|$|E
25|$|At the inquest, {{the medical}} {{examiner}} explains that chloral hydrate {{was given to the}} victim before he was murdered. After the inquest, Edna Brent, one of the secretaries, expresses confusion <b>at</b> <b>something</b> said in evidence. She tries but fails to convey this to Hardcastle. She is soon found dead in a telephone box on Wilbraham Crescent, strangled with her own scarf. The dead man's identity is yet unknown. Mrs Merlina Rival (original name Flossie Gapp) identifies the dead man as her one-time husband, Harry Castleton. Colin leaves Britain on his own case, travelling behind the Iron Curtain to Romania. He returns with the information he needed, but not the person he hoped to find. Following Poirot's advice, Colin talks with the neighbours. He finds a ten-year-old girl, Geraldine Brown, in the apartment block across the street. She has been observing and recording the events at Wilbraham Crescent while confined to her room with a broken leg. She reveals that a new laundry service delivered a heavy basket of laundry {{on the morning of the}} murder. Colin tells Hardcastle.|$|E
500|$|She and I {{sat down}} and wrote this song about some serious insecurities that we had {{when we first started}} down this road with each other, and we both had trust issues. We were getting over it, but we wrote this song about it. And it's perfect. I couldn't be happier about that song and the way it came about and the honest way ... It is like people getting a look <b>at</b> <b>something</b> {{personal}} for the first time.|$|E

500|$|Zelda Fitzgerald's {{collected}} writings (including Save Me the Waltz), {{edited by}} Matthew J. Bruccoli, {{were published in}} 1991. New York Times literary critic Michiko Kakutani wrote, [...] "That the novel was written in two months is amazing. That for all its flaws it still manages to charm, amuse and move the reader is even more remarkable. Zelda Fitzgerald succeeded, in this novel, in conveying her own heroic desperation to succeed <b>at</b> <b>something</b> of her own, and she also managed to distinguish herself as a writer with, as Edmund Wilson once said of her husband, a 'gift for turning language into something iridescent and surprising.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} its release, Living in the Material World {{gained a reputation}} as [...] "a forgotten blockbuster" [...] – a term used by Simon Leng and echoed by commentators such as Robert Rodriguez and AllMusic's Bruce Eder. The latter describes Harrison's 1973 album as [...] "an underrated minor masterpiece" [...] that [...] "represent his solo playing and songwriting <b>at</b> <b>something</b> of a peak". John Metzger of The Music Box refers to Material World as [...] "the most underrated and overlooked album of 's career", adding that it [...] "coalesces around its songs … and the Zen-like beauty that emanates from Harrison's hymns to a higher power inevitably becomes subtly affecting." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{turned to}} her {{paternal}} grandmother for solace. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly {{to take the place}} of their beloved mother. Madonna later told Vanity Fair that she saw herself in her youth as a [...] "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good <b>at</b> <b>something.</b> I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades.... I wanted to be somebody." [...] Terrified that her father Tony could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him.|$|E
500|$|Support among {{senators}} for {{the resolution}} came about {{after the release of}} the Kony 2012 video and its subsequent popularity. One of the resolution leaders, Senator Chris Coons, became aware of the situation after his daughters asked him what he was doing to stop Kony and Senator Roy Blunt was informed [...] "at a Missouri caucus in St. Louis when a constituent quizzed him about Kony". One of the co-sponsors of the resolution, Senator Lindsey Graham, stated that, [...] "When you get 100 million Americans looking <b>at</b> <b>something,</b> you will get our attention.

Slant Magazine's Aaron Scott called it [...] "the best track on the album," [...] writing, [...] "The surprising content about a marriage that is resisting divorce will certainly appeal to a generation of youth subjected to a massive divorce epidemic.
