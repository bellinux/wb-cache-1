5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} studios generally take numerous precautions {{to protect the}} health of the person being pierced and the piercer. Piercers are expected to sanitize the location to be pierced as well as their hands, even though they will often wear gloves during the procedure (and in some areas must, as it is prescribed by law). Quite frequently, these gloves will be changed multiple times, often one pair for each step of setup to avoid cross contamination. For example, after a piercer wearing gloves has cleaned the area to be pierced on a client, the piercer may change gloves to avoid recontaminating the area. Wearing sterile gloves is required by law for professional piercing procedures in some areas, such as the states of Florida and South Carolina. Tools and jewellery should be sterilized in <b>autoclaves,</b> and non-autoclavable surfaces should be cleaned with disinfectant agents on a regular basis and between clients.|$|E
25|$|Gamma {{radiation}} {{is often used}} to kill living organisms, in a process called irradiation. Applications of this include the sterilization of medical equipment (as an alternative to <b>autoclaves</b> or chemical means), the removal of decay-causing bacteria from many foods and the prevention of the sprouting of fruit and vegetables to maintain freshness and flavor.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>autoclaves</b> have {{meters and}} charts that record or display information, {{particularly}} temperature and pressure {{as a function}} of time. The information is checked to ensure that the conditions required for sterilization have been met. Indicator tape is often placed on packages of products prior to autoclaving, and some packaging incorporates indicators. The indicator changes color when exposed to steam, providing a visual confirmation.|$|E
40|$|Characteristics of <b>autoclaved,</b> and <b>autoclaved</b> then acetylated, ae, wx {{and normal}} maize {{starches}} were studied. Prior <b>autoclaving</b> decreased {{the degree of}} acetylation of all the starches. After <b>autoclaving</b> the gelatinization peak temperature (Tp) increased and peak viscosity (PV) generally decreased. The Tp of <b>autoclaved</b> then acetylated starches increased and PV decreased compared with acetylated native starches except for waxy starch which showed a higher PV. <b>Autoclaving</b> increased hardness and adhesiveness of waxy and normal starches, but decreased that of ae starches. Acetylation decreased hardness of all the native and <b>autoclaved</b> starches. <b>Autoclaving</b> decreased swelling power and solubility of all the starches except waxy. Acetylation increased swelling power and solubility of all the native and <b>autoclaved</b> starches. <b>Autoclaving</b> decreased clarity and digestibility of all the starches. <b>Autoclaved</b> starches increased less in clarity and more in digestibility than native starches after acetylation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|While {{significantly}} {{resistant to}} heat and radiation, endospores can {{be destroyed by burning}} or by autoclaving at a temperature exceeding {{the boiling point}} of water, 100°C. Endospores are able to survive at 100°C for hours, although the longer the number of hours the fewer that will survive. An indirect way to destroy them is to place them in an environment that reactivates them to their vegetative state. They will germinate within a day or two with the right environmental conditions, and then the vegetative cells, not as hardy as endospores, can be straightforwardly destroyed. This indirect method is called Tyndallization. It was the usual method for a while in the late 19th century before the introduction of inexpensive <b>autoclaves.</b> Prolonged exposure to ionising radiation, such as x-rays and gamma rays, will also kill most endospores.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the antimicrobial effect of different copaiba oil concentrations against the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, and analyze differences in inhibition of microorganisms with <b>autoclaved</b> and non <b>autoclaved</b> oil. This study provided an agar diffusion test with six isolates of bacteria and six different concentrations of <b>autoclaved</b> or non <b>autoclaved</b> copaiba oil and a negative control. The results showed sensitivity of five L. monocytogenes isolates related to the 10 % <b>autoclaved</b> solution of copaiba oil. Four strains also showed sensitivity to the 5 % <b>autoclaved</b> solution and one to 2. 5 % <b>autoclaved</b> solution. The 10 % non <b>autoclaved</b> oil solution showed growth inhibition only for two strains. These results had pointed the 10 % <b>autoclaved</b> solution of copaiba oil with higher inhibition as all other solutions and concentrations tested (P< 0. 05). For the other concentrations of both solutions, the 5 and 2. 5 % <b>autoclaved</b> and 10 % non <b>autoclaved</b> solutions had presented statistically equal. All other concentrations of both copaiba solutions and the negative control did not presented any bacteria inhibition. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that the <b>autoclaved</b> copaiba oil may be a potential new agent source for infection control or for food preservation, inhibiting the growth of food-borne bacteria such as L. monocytogenes...|$|R
2500|$|A {{widely used}} method for heat {{sterilization}} is the [...] autoclave, sometimes called a converter or steam sterilizer. <b>Autoclaves</b> use steam heated to 121-134°C under pressure. To achieve sterility, {{the article is}} placed in a chamber and heated by injected steam until the article reaches a time and temperature setpoint. [...] Almost all the air {{is removed from the}} chamber, because air is undesired in the moist heat sterilization process (this is one trait that differ from a typical pressure cooker used for food cooking). The article is held at the temperature setpoint {{for a period of time}} which varies depending on what bioburden is present on the article being sterilized and its resistance (D-value) to steam sterilization. A general cycle would be anywhere between 3 and 15 minutes, (depending on the generated heat) at 121°C at 100 kPa, which is sufficient to provide a sterility assurance level of 10−4 for a product with a bioburden of 106 and a D-value of 2.0 minutes. Following sterilization, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. This may be achieved by gradually depressurizing the sterilization chamber and allowing liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.|$|E

The society representing the 8,000 Iranians suffering from thalassemia, an inherited blood disorder, has said its members are beginning to die because of a lack of an essential drug, deferoxamine, used to control the iron content in the blood. Further, Iran can no longer buy medical equipment such as <b>autoclaves,</b> essential for the production of many drugs, because some of the biggest Western pharmaceutical companies refuse to do business with the country.|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>autoclaves</b> {{was a big}} step {{in the direction of}} widespread treatment of refuse, and so many functional forms of <b>autoclaves</b> are currently in operation at landfills and treatment centers around the world. Some common features of <b>autoclaves</b> that differentiate them from competing technologies are as follows. <b>Autoclaves</b> employ the moist-heat method to sterilize and deactivate refuse in a large pressure vessel where saturated steam is injected. The end product is completely sanitized and even previously bio-hazardous waste can be discarded in a normal municipal landfill. <b>Autoclaves</b> employ the same method of sterilization as converters, but do so using larger and more complex equipment that also has higher safety and energy consumption requirements. In a majority of cases, <b>autoclaves</b> are hub-and-spoke operations requiring regional treatment centers and a supply chain.|$|E
