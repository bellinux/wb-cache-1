5|$|After the Battle of Svolder, {{the victorious}} leaders split Norway into areas of control. Heimskringla gives the most {{detailed}} account of the division, describing it as threefold. Olaf the Swede received four districts in Trondheim as well as Møre, Romsdal and Rånrike. He gave these to Jarl Svein Hákonarson, his son in law, to hold as a vassal. Svein Forkbeard gained possession of the Viken district, where Danish influence had long been strong. The rest of Norway was ruled by Eirik Hákonarson as Svein's vassal. Fagrskinna, in contrast, says that the Swedish part consisted of Oppland <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of Trondheim. Other sources are less specific.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that sleep duration is closely associated with metabolic risk factors. However, the relationship between habitual sleep duration and blood pressure values in Japanese population has not been fully established. We performed a cross-sectional study of 1, 670 Japanese male subjects to clarify the relationship between habitual sleep duration and blood pressure values. The study subjects were divided into four groups (< 6, 6 -, 7 -, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 8 h) according to their nightly habitual sleep duration. The rate of subjects with < 6, 6 -, 7 -, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 8 h sleep duration was 12. 0, 37. 6, 38. 2, and 12. 2 %, respectively. Compared with the group with 7 -h sleep duration (referent), the < 6 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 8 h groups had significantly greater systolic and diastolic blood pressure values. The rate of hypertensive subjects, defined as systolic blood pressure <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 90 mmHg, with sleep duration of < 6, 6 -, 7 -, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 8 h was 13. 4, 5. 7, 7. 5, and 13. 8 %, respectively. Compared with the group with 7 -h sleep duration (referent), the multivariate odds ratios (95 % confidence interval) of the groups with < 6 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>parts</b> per thousand yen 8 h for hypertension was 2. 43 (1. 40 - 4. 20, P < 0. 01) and 2. 28 (1. 31 - 3. 95, P < 0. 01), respectively, adjusted for conventional cardiovascular risk factors. The present study demonstrates that both long and short habitual sleep duration were significantly associated with high blood pressure values and hypertension occurrence in Japanese male subjects...|$|R

5|$|Initially {{the film}} was planned as a short fiction, the project {{evolving}} during 2005. At the time, Nemescu also had planned what would later become the feature film California Dreamin', impossible to film at that moment, deciding that Marilena from P7 could prove a useful exercise for both director and actors. Thus the screenplay was rewritten and filming started with a very reduced budget of only US $14,000, which was collected by Nemescu by participating at various film festivals, with older short fictions. During development, however, the film received new funds, though still modest ones, thus the actors <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the team accepted to work for free.|$|E

5|$|Business US Highway41 (Bus. US41) {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway that}} served as a business loop off US41 and M-28 in Marquette, Michigan, along Washington and Front streets.

Those two streets originate with the early founding of the city {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. Jurisdiction over them was transferred to the city as part of a highway swap that resulted in the decommissioning of the trunkline in 2005. It was also previously co-designated Bus. M-28, mirroring the Bus. US41/Bus. M-28 designation previously used along Bus. M-28 in Ishpeming and Negaunee. Washington and Front streets had been a part of the state highway system since the 1910s, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the United States Numbered Highway System since 1926.

5|$|By 1537 {{the area}} {{immediately}} {{north of the}} new colony of Guatemala was being {{referred to as the}} Tierra de Guerra ("Land of War"). Paradoxically, it was simultaneously known as Verapaz ("True Peace"). The Land of War described an area that was undergoing conquest; it was a region of dense forest that was difficult for the Spanish to penetrate militarily. Whenever the Spanish located a centre of population in this region, the inhabitants were moved and concentrated in a new colonial settlement {{near the edge of the}} jungle where the Spanish could more easily control them. This strategy resulted in the gradual depopulation of the forest, simultaneously converting it into a wilderness refuge for those fleeing Spanish domination, both for individual refugees and for entire communities, especially those congregaciones that were remote from centres of colonial authority. The Land of War, from the 16th century through to the start of the 18th century, included a vast area from Sacapulas in the west to Nito on the Caribbean coast and extended northwards from Rabinal and Salamá, and was an intermediate area between the highlands and the northern lowlands. It includes the modern departments of Baja Verapaz and Alta Verapaz, Izabal and Petén, as well as the eastern part of El Quiché <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the Mexican state of Chiapas. The western portion of this area was the territory of the Q'eqchi' Maya.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the successes}} under Basil, {{during the reign}} of his {{successor}} Leo VI the Wise (886–912), the Empire again faced serious threats. In the north, a war broke out against the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the Imperial Fleet was used in 895 to ferry an army of Magyars across the Danube to raid Bulgaria. The Bulgarian war produced several costly defeats, {{while at the same time}} the Arab naval threat reached new heights, with successive raids devastating the shores of Byzantium's naval heartland, the Aegean Sea. In 891 or 893, the Arab fleet sacked the island of Samos and took its stratēgos prisoner, and in 898, the eunuch admiral Raghib carried off 3,000 Byzantine sailors of the Kibyrrhaiotai as prisoners. These losses denuded Byzantine defences, opening the Aegean up to raids by the Syrian fleets. The first heavy blow came in 901, when the renegade Damian of Tarsus plundered Demetrias, while in the next year, Taormina, the Empire's last outpost in Sicily, fell to the Muslims. The greatest disaster, however, came in 904, when another renegade, Leo of Tripoli, raided the Aegean. His fleet penetrated even into the Dardanelles, before proceeding to sack the Empire's second city, Thessalonica, all while the Empire's fleet remained passive in the face of the Arabs' superior numbers. Furthermore, the Cretan corsairs' raids reached such intensity, that by the end of Leo's reign, most of the southern Aegean islands were either abandoned or forced to accept Muslim control and pay tribute to the pirates. It is no surprise that a defensive and cautious mindset is prevalent in the Leo's contemporary instructions on naval warfare (Naumachica).|$|E

Unlike Alpenvorland and Küstenland, these zones did not immediately receive high commissioners (oberster kommissar) as civilian advisors, but were military regions where the commander was to exercise power on behalf of Army Group B. Operation zone Nordwest-Alpen or Schweizer Grenze was located between the Stelvio Pass and Monte Rosa and was to contain wholly the Italian provinces of Sondrio and Como and parts of the provinces of Brescia, Varese, Novara and Vercelli. The zone of Französische Grenze was to encompass areas west of Monte Rosa and was to incorporate the province of Aosta <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the province of Turin, and presumably also the provinces of Cuneo and Imperia.|$|E

In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled MUL.APIN, the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior Ninurta, and the bow with Ishtar, daughter of Enlil. Ninurta was linked to the later deity Marduk, who was said to have slain the ocean goddess Tiamat with a great bow, and worshipped as the principal deity in Babylon. The Ancient Greeks replaced the bow and arrow depiction with that of a dog.|$|E
