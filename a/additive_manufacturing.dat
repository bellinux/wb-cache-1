25|$|<b>Additive</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> {{starting}} with today's infancy period, requires manufacturing firms to be flexible, ever-improving users of all available technologies to remain competitive. Advocates of <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> also predict that this arc of technological development will counter globalization, as end users will {{do much of}} their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products from other people and corporations. The real integration of the newer additive technologies into commercial production, however, is {{more a matter of}} complementing traditional subtractive methods rather than displacing them entirely.|$|E
25|$|ISO/ASTM52900-15 defines seven {{categories}} of <b>Additive</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> (AM) processes within its meaning: binder jetting, directed energy deposition, material extrusion, material jetting, powder bed fusion, sheet lamination, and vat photopolymerization.|$|E
50|$|Makhlouf {{controlled}} three Syrian companies {{close to}} the government of Bashar Al-Assad - Maxima Middle East Trading, Morgan <b>Additives</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> and Pangates International. These companies used Mossack Fonseca shell companies registered in the Seychelles and British Virgin Islands to ease the pressure global sanctions put on his cousin's regime. He paid for the Syrian Air Force helicopter fuel through shell companies, for example. The US Treasury sanctioned Makhlouf, charging that Pangates had supplied the Assad government with a thousand tonnes of aviation fuel.|$|R

[...] The other two, Maxima Middle East Trading and Morgan <b>Additives</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> Co, and their owners Wael Abdulkarim and Ahmad Barqawi, {{were said to have}} [...] "engaged in deceptive measures" [...] to supply oil products to Syria.|$|R
40|$|<b>Additive</b> layer <b>manufacturing</b> is {{emerging}} as the next generation in part manufacture. It is being adopted by aerospace, tool making, dental and medical industries to produce and develop new conceptual designs and products due to its speed and flexibility. It has been noted that parts produced using <b>additive</b> layer <b>manufacturing</b> are not to a consistent quality. Variations have been recorded showing inadequate control over dimensional tolerances, surface roughness, porosity, and other defects in built parts. It is, however, possible to control these variables using real-time processes that currently lack adequate process measurement methods. This paper identifies process variation and lists parameters currently being recorded during a commercial additive manufacture (AM) machine build process. Furthermore, it examines correlations between manufactured parts and real time build variations...|$|R
25|$|Good {{examples}} of threaded parts produced with <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> {{are found in}} the dental implant and bone screw fields, where selective laser sintering and selective laser melting have produced threaded titanium implants.|$|E
25|$|In {{the current}} scenario, 3D {{printing}} or AM {{has been used}} in manufacturing, medical, industry and sociocultural sectors which facilitate 3D printing or AM to become successful commercial technology. The earliest application of <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> was on the toolroom end of the manufacturing spectrum. For example, rapid prototyping was one of the earliest additive variants, and its mission was to reduce the lead time and cost of developing prototypes of new parts and devices, which was earlier only done with subtractive toolroom methods such as CNC milling, turning, and precision grinding. In the 2010s, <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> entered production to a much greater extent.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{techniques}} like {{injection moulding}} {{can be less}} expensive for manufacturing polymer products in high quantities, but <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> can be faster, more flexible and less expensive when producing relatively small quantities of parts. 3D printers give designers and concept development teams the ability to produce parts and concept models using a desktop size printer.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 2010s, the terms 3D {{printing}} and <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> evolved senses {{in which they}} were alternate umbrella terms for AM technologies, one being used in popular vernacular by consumer-maker communities and the media, and the other used more formally by industrial AM end-use part producers, AM machine manufacturers, and global technical standards organizations. Until recently, the term 3D printing has been associated with machines low-end in price or in capability. Both terms reflect that the technologies share the theme of sequential-layer material addition or joining throughout a 3D work envelope under automated control. Peter Zelinski, the editor-in-chief of <b>Additive</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> magazine, pointed out in 2017 that the terms are still often synonymous in casual usage but that some manufacturing industry experts are increasingly making a sense distinction whereby AM comprises 3D printing plus other technologies or other aspects of a manufacturing process.|$|E
25|$|It {{might be}} {{possible}} to print organs, or possibly entire organisms using <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> techniques. A recent innovative method of construction uses an ink-jet mechanism to print precise layers of cells in a matrix of thermoreversible gel. Endothelial cells, the cells that line blood vessels, have been printed in a set of stacked rings. When incubated, these fused into a tube.|$|E
50|$|Neoweb is a non-corrosive, inert {{engineering}} thermoplastic resistant to extreme environmental conditions, heat, cold, water, wind and dust. It operates in temperature extremes of -60°C to +60°C, {{and has been}} successfully used in environments from deserts to saturated peat bogs to the arctic tundra. Special <b>additives</b> and <b>manufacturing</b> processes make Neoweb highly resistant to environmental influences, such as UV radiation and oxidation, during long-term outdoor storage, installation as well for long-term project design-life.|$|R
25|$|Selective laser {{sintering}} is an <b>additive</b> rapid <b>manufacturing</b> technique {{that uses a}} high power laser to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass representing a desired 3-dimensional object. The laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning cross-sections generated from a 3-D digital description of the part {{on the surface of}} a powder bed. Selective {{laser sintering}} was invented and patented by Dr. Carl Deckard at the University of Texas at Austin in 1989.|$|R
50|$|The {{rendition}} of the term that relates to the additive fabrication processes has its origins at the RMRG (Rapid Manufacturing Research Group) at Loughborough University in the United Kingdom. The term forms {{a part of a}} descriptive taxonomy of terms relating directly to various particulars relating to the <b>additive</b> CAD-CAM <b>manufacturing</b> processes, originally established {{as a part of the}} research conducted by architect Thomas Modeen into the application of the aforementioned techniques in the context of architecture.|$|R
25|$|Many, perhaps most, {{threaded}} parts {{have potential}} to be generated via <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> (3D printing), {{of which there are}} many variants, including fused deposition modeling, selective laser sintering, direct metal laser sintering, selective laser melting, electron beam melting, layered object manufacturing, and stereolithography. For most additive technologies, it has not been long since they emerged from the laboratory end of their historical development, but further commercialization is picking up speed. To date, most additive methods tend to produce a rough surface finish and tend to be restricted in the material properties that they can produce, and thus their earliest commercial victories have been in parts for which those restrictions were acceptable. However, the capabilities are continually growing.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s, {{a number}} of writers and social {{commentators}} have speculated in some depth about {{the social and cultural}} changes that might result from the advent of commercially affordable <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> technology. Amongst the more notable ideas to have emerged from these inquiries has been the suggestion that, as more and more 3D printers start to enter people's homes, the conventional relationship between the home and the workplace might get further eroded. Likewise, it has also been suggested that, as it becomes easier for businesses to transmit designs for new objects around the globe, so the need for high-speed freight services might also become less. Finally, given the ease with which certain objects can now be replicated, {{it remains to be seen}} whether changes will be made to current copyright legislation so as to protect intellectual property rights with the new technology widely available.|$|E
25|$|AM {{processes}} for metal sintering or melting (such as selective laser sintering, direct metal laser sintering, and selective laser melting) usually went {{by their own}} individual names in the 1980s and 1990s. At the time, all metalworking was done by processes that we now call non-additive (casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining); although plenty of automation was applied to those technologies (such as by robot welding and CNC), {{the idea of a}} tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal (rather than adding it), such as CNC milling, CNC EDM, and many others. But the automated techniques that added metal, which would later be called <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> were beginning to challenge that assumption. By the mid-1990s, new techniques for material deposition were developed at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, including microcasting and sprayed materials. Sacrificial and support materials had also become more common, enabling new object geometries.|$|E
40|$|<b>Additive</b> layer <b>manufacturing</b> (ALM) {{methods such as}} {{selective}} laser melting (SLM) and laser metal deposition (LMD) enable production of parts with complicated shapes. Iron based aluminides are a new promising class of materials for high temperature applications. Near net shape production by ALM is specifically interesting in case of these wear resistant aluminides, where machining is difficult. In this article the microstructure of aluminides prepared by SLM and LMD will be compared with those prepared by spark plasma sintering of the same compositions...|$|R
40|$|Considering a {{rectangular}} panel of pixels {{arranged in a}} grid, we introduce a taxonomy of damages based on spatial arrangements of dysfunctional pixels. We detect these different types of damage in experimental data obtained from a detector from an X-ray machine used for <b>additive</b> layer <b>manufacturing</b> object visualisation.

As a practical application, we propose a protocol for performance monitoring for detector panels...|$|R

40|$|<b>Additive</b> Layer <b>Manufacturing</b> (ALM) shows a great {{potential}} {{for the production of}} lightweight designed components. The use of lattice structures {{is one of the most}} common approaches for lightweight design in ALM because they show a high stiffness and strength combined with a small mass. To reach an optimum design, these structures should not have a periodical build up, but have to be optimized concerning their course and the strut's diameters. For the load dependent adaption of the diameters, the material properties of such filigree structures have to be known well. This geometry-dependent, anisotropic material behavior is described in the following paper...|$|R
