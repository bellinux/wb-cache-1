50|$|Although Barbary macaques {{are sexually}} active at all points during <b>a</b> <b>female’s</b> {{reproductive}} cycle, male Barbary macaques determine <b>a</b> <b>female’s</b> most fertile period by sexual swellings on the female. Mating is most common during <b>a</b> <b>female’s</b> most fertile period. The swelling {{size of the}} <b>female</b> reaches <b>a</b> maximum {{around the time of}} ovulation, suggesting that size helps a male predict when he should mate. This is further supported by the fact that male ejaculation peaks {{at the same time that}} female sexual swelling peaks. There is not a sufficient change in female sexual behaviour around the time of ovulation in order to demonstrate to the male that the female is fertile. The swellings, therefore, appear necessary for predicting fertility.|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>female</b> P. labiata {{more often}} pursues small jumping spiders and web spiders than larger prey. While it more often catches small jumping spiders than larger ones, {{it is about}} equally {{effective}} with all sizes of web spiders up to twice P. labiata′s size. <b>A</b> <b>female</b> P. labiata is effective against insects up to twice P. labiata′s size when the insect is stuck in a non-salticid's web, and against insects not in webs and up to P. labiata′s size, while P. labiata seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in the open. <b>A</b> <b>female</b> P. labiata very seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in her own web, and is slightly less effective against smaller insects in P. labiata′s web than in other situations. Males are less efficient in all cases.|$|E

5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} system is that <b>a</b> <b>female</b> can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. <b>A</b> <b>female</b> who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. <b>A</b> <b>female</b> kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E
