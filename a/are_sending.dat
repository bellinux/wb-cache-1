5|$|The USS Enterprise is {{on patrol}} near the Romulan neutral zone {{and the crew}} is {{experiencing}} unusual dreams. Captain James T. Kirk and Science Officer Spock both confess that they are having dreams that Spock is Captain {{of the ship and}} Kirk is an Ensign. Kirk informs Spock that Starfleet intelligence has discovered that the Romulans are attempting to use time travel and <b>are</b> <b>sending</b> more ships to investigate. Captain Kirk goes to sleep, and awakes as Ensign Kirk on the VSS ShiKahr, which appears to otherwise be the Enterprise. The Ensign is a drug addled ex-convict who has been on board for only a day.|$|E
25|$|Remittances from expatriates were a {{major source}} of foreign {{exchange}} in the 1970s and early 1980s. Continuous migration to New Zealand has shifted most members of nuclear and extended families there, removing the need to send remittances back home. In the late 1990s, PFTAC conducted studies on the balance of payments, which confirmed that Niueans are receiving few remittances but <b>are</b> <b>sending</b> more money overseas.|$|E

How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable? What are we thinking?When we think about this case, we need to think about the message that we <b>are</b> <b>sending</b> to our children and our grandchildren. What we do in this Chamber tonight is as important as anything we have done in defending our Nation, in doing the things that we do as Members of Congress.|$|E
25|$|Moroccan {{officials}} have heralded {{a significant increase}} in the amount of money Moroccan expatriates <b>are</b> <b>sending</b> home. Government efforts are underway to encourage Moroccans living abroad to increase their investments at home, and to allay concerns about bureaucracy and corruption. With money sent home by Moroccan migrants reaching $5.7 billion in 2007, Morocco came in second, behind Egypt, on the recent World Bank list of the top 10 MENA remittance recipient countries. Neighbouring Algeria ($2.9 billion) came in at number five. In fact according to the World Bank, remittances constituted 9.5% of GDP in Morocco in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Nineteen {{years after}} Voldemort's downfall, Ron and Hermione have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, whom they <b>are</b> <b>sending</b> {{off to her}} first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo. Though the {{epilogue}} does not explicitly say Ron and Hermione are married, news articles and other sources treat it as a fact. Ron has also passed his Muggle driving test, despite Hermione's apparent belief {{that he could not}} do so without Confunding the examiner. (Ron secretly reveals to Harry he actually did Confund the examiner.) He and Harry work for the Ministry of Magic as Aurors, and along with Hermione they have helped to revamp the Ministry; it is far different from the one that existed previously. Before becoming an Auror, Ron joins George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, which becomes a very lucrative business.|$|E

500|$|Holst {{was given}} a {{spectacular}} send-off. The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, [...] "Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA <b>are</b> <b>sending</b> me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, {{has given me a}} parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning. So we're going to do The Planets, and you've got to conduct'." [...] There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.|$|E
500|$|In April 2015, Daft Punk {{appeared}} in a short tribute to Rodgers {{as part of a}} documentary on his life titled [...] "Nile Rodgers: From Disco to Daft Punk". In the short clip, the two send a [...] "transmission" [...] to Rodgers with the message, [...] "Dear Nile, We <b>are</b> <b>sending</b> you this transmission to thank you for all your amazing songs. Your music continues to inspire the world... With love, Daft Punk". Later in 2015, a documentary on Daft Punk titled Daft Punk Unchained was released. The film covers Daft Punk's music career from the 1990s up to and including their 2014 Grammy appearance. The documentary features interviews with Rodgers, Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, and others who have interacted with the duo in their projects.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Yodel It!" [...] was {{met with}} a mixed {{response}} from music critics. Reviewers from Wiwibloggs had {{both positive and negative}} opinions of the recording, praising its staging potential, the mixture of multiple genres and the singers' stage presence, but also criticized the yodeling sequences. An editor jokingly wrote, [...] "Look, if Switzerland <b>are</b> <b>sending</b> a Romanian band this year, why shouldn't Romania send a yodeller in return?" [...] Overall, the reviewers on the website gave the song 7.36 out of 10 points. A later review lowered the score to 5.69 out of 10 points. Matei Ruta from EuroVisionary noticed that [...] "Yodel It!" [...] had a [...] "mass appealing sound and has the important quality of being an earworm". Critical commentary also likened parts of the song {{to the sound of the}} band The Script and will.i.am's [...] "Hall of Fame" [...] (2012). The judges of the Selecția Națională were positive and found that the song had a simple construction and applauded its catchiness. Traian Danciu of Adevărul similarly praised [...] "Yodel It!" [...] and its optimistic message. The track was also predicted to rank highly at Eurovision by a number of international publications, and reached number six in the betting odds before the contest. Eurovision specialist Andrei Faur had a negative opinion of the track, calling it mediocre and unfeeling. He also noted yodeling was not a typical element of Romanian culture.|$|E

500|$|In her room, Anna replays the {{confrontation}} in her mind, her anger building ("Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?"). [...] Lady Thiang, the King's head wife, tells Anna that the King is troubled by his portrayal in the West as a barbarian, as the British are being urged {{to take over}} Siam as a protectorate. [...] Anna is shocked by the accusations – the King is a polygamist, but he is no barbarian – but she is reluctant to see him after their argument. [...] Lady Thiang convinces her that the King is deserving of support ("Something Wonderful"). [...] Anna goes to him and finds him anxious for reconciliation. [...] The King tells her that the British <b>are</b> <b>sending</b> an envoy to Bangkok to evaluate the situation. [...] Anna [...] "guesses" [...] – the only guise in which the King will accept advice – that the King will receive the envoy in European style, and that the wives will be dressed in Western fashion. [...] Tuptim has been writing a play based on a book that Anna has lent her, Uncle Tom's Cabin, that can {{be presented to the}} guests. [...] News is brought to the King that the British are arriving much earlier than thought, and so Anna and the wives are to stay up all night to prepare. [...] The King assembles his family for a Buddhist prayer for the success of the venture and also promises before Buddha that Anna will receive her own house [...] "as provided in agreement, etc., etc." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXII" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology was positive {{and gave the}} episode a rating of seven out of ten, but commented that he preferred [...] "episodes that feature longer, more involved storylines more than the spoof collections." [...] At The A.V. Club, Hayden Childs gave the episode a C+ grade, saying, [...] "The writers seem unwilling to mock the more outrageous aspects of the movies they <b>are</b> <b>sending</b> up and settle for weakly batting at the obvious. Some of the jokes land, but none land too solidly." [...] Meredith Woerner of io9 thought that [...] "he whole thing never quite achieved {{the same level of}} brilliance as some previous years — even though the Avatar bit was funny, we've seen so many Avatar spoofs by now that, well, it's tired. However we did get a lot of joy out of seeing Homer dressed up as Doctor Manhattan and Maggie as a wee-little chest burster." [...] Even more critical was CraveOnline's Blair Marnell who gave the episode a rating of three out of ten. He commented that [...] "there is no stronger argument for ending 'The Simpsons' than the latest Halloween installment of 'Treehouse of Horror'" [...] and further said that [...] "in all honesty, it's amazing how tame 'The Simpsons' has become over the years. This show used to be the 'South Park' of its day. Now it's just showing its age and it's no longer the cool TV rebel that it used to be." [...] Alex Strachan had the opposite reaction in a review in Calgary Herald and concluded that we should [...] "orget all that talk about The Simpsons being past its prime. Based on tonight's sharp-eyed, keen-witted Treehouse of Horror XXII - funnier, faster and more fright-worthy than last year's dud, thankfully - there's a lot of ink left in the old ink pot yet." ...|$|E
