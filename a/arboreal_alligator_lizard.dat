50|$|It {{typically}} takes Cope's <b>arboreal</b> <b>alligator</b> <b>lizards</b> {{until the}} second reproductive season {{for them to be}} large and sexually mature enough to reproduce. These lizards are viviparous (they do not lay eggs like many other reptiles), but will give birth to live pups. The mating ritual of this <b>alligator</b> <b>lizard</b> is similar to other lizards, which will begin with the male lizard biting the head of the female in a display of his strength and fitness for mating. They will remain in this position until the female succumbs to the male and allows him to mate with her This embrace could last for several hours. Each female will only give birth to one litter per year, of between 7 and 14 babies per litter. The breeding season for this species can be as broad as July to November with the newborns being delivered between the months of March to July. The gestation period for this lizard is between 6 and 8 months, during which time the female will gain weight and develop what is known as “chalk sacs” on her jowls as a calcium supply. After birth, she does not provide any postnatal care to her young. Once born, these lizards do not need to rely on a limited diet, but can begin consuming the same material as their adult counterparts.|$|R
