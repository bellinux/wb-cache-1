5|$|Captive whales have {{occasionally}} {{been known}} to mimic human speech. Scientists have suggested this indicates a strong desire {{on behalf of the}} whales to communicate with humans, as whales have <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> vocal mechanism, so imitating human speech likely takes considerable effort.|$|E
5|$|Castle is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} catch-all term {{for all kinds of}} fortifications and, as a result, has been misapplied in the technical sense. An example of this is Maiden Castle which, despite the name, is an Iron Age hill fort which had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> origin and purpose.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} from most other swallows in their breeding or wintering ranges by the streaking on the underparts. Although the lesser striped swallow has white underparts with dark streaking, it is larger, has a deeply forked tail and <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> plumage, with dark blue upperparts, a red rump and a chestnut head.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} {{in that they}} are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The {{differences between the two groups}} are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Cauldron, Palace {{employee}} Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation. Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} eleven seasons of Doctor Who, often the {{surviving}} materials are in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> format or condition from their original broadcast masters. Surviving 1960s material is recorded on film stock of varying quality, while early 1970s material {{is available in}} a patchwork of professional and consumer formats. To present the material in a form approximating its original broadcast masters requires extensive technical work, and {{a certain amount of}} invention.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> {{version of}} the film was released; much of the live-action {{sequences}} were replaced by animation, and dialogue was heavily rewritten and reedited. It was given a limited release in the United States and went largely unnoticed; it performed respectably in foreign markets, and developed a cult following. The original {{version of the}} film remains unreleased.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, audiences had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> take on his work. Many {{perceived}} it as {{a subversive}} and Marxist satire on American capitalism. If not subversive, {{it was at}} least considered a Marxist critique of pop culture. Given Warhol's apolitical outlook in general this is not likely the intended message. It is likely that his pop art was nothing more than an attempt to attract attention to his work.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s two men began to {{assemble}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> picture of Hubbard's life. Michael Linn Shannon, {{a resident of}} Portland, Oregon, became interested in Hubbard's life story after an encounter with a Scientology recruiter. Over {{the next four years}} he collected previously undisclosed records and documents. He intended to write an exposé of Hubbard and sent a copy of his findings and key records to a number of contacts but was unable to find a publisher.|$|E

Meanwhile, a team led by Captain Jonathan Archer has {{infiltrated}} the Xindi weapon while it is en route to Earth. Both the spheres and the weapon are destroyed, but Archer is lost, presumed dead. Enterprise returns to Earth but the crew suddenly find that they have been sent back in time to <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Lady Wilkinson (1858), who {{provides}} an extensive {{discussion of the}} etymology of the various names for this plant, suggests <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> origin, namely the Old English word affodyle (that which cometh early), citing a 14th-century (but likely originally much earlier) manuscript {{in support of this}} theory, and which appears to describe a plant resembling the daffodil. Ellacombe provides further support for this from a fifteenth century English translation of Palladius that also refers to it.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the {{referendum}} was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E

5|$|Recent studies, {{based on}} the {{discovery}} of a penny of Eanred for which a date no earlier than c. 850 is proposed, suggest <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> dating for ninth-century Northumbrian kings. From this, it is argued that Eardwulf's second reign ended circa 830, rather than in the years soon after 810, and that the reigns of subsequent kings should be re-dated accordingly: Eanred from 830 to 854, Æthelred II from 854 to 862, Rædwulf in 858, and Osberht from 862 to 867.|$|E

5|$|The {{memorial}} is {{not without}} its critics. Alana Vincent has argued that constituent parts of the monument are in conflict, and as a result the message conveyed by the monument is not unified. Visually, Vincent argues there is a dichotomy between the triumphant pose of the figures {{at the top of the}} pylons and the mourning posture of those figures at the base. Textually, she argues the inscription text celebrating the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge strikes <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> tone to the list of names of the missing at the base of the monument.|$|E

5|$|Upon its {{inception}} in 1921, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> M-86 was routed along a portion of present-day M-66 from M-46 at Six Lakes northward to Remus, ending at M-24 (modern M-20). A few years later in 1924–25, M-66 was extended north to Remus, supplanting the contemporary M-86. At the same time, the M-86 designation was relocated to Ionia County to run from M-44 in Orleans to M-43 (present day M-66) just east of there. In late 1929, M-44 was extended east from Orleans to junction with M-43, once again, causing M-86 to be supplanted and removed from the highway system.|$|E
5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} disclosed to us, as an example: In {{that section of}} the game, there is a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, {{you can see that}} it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Tsar Alexander I laid all {{the blame}} on M. I. Kutuzov, Commander-in-chief of the Allied Army. However, {{it is clear that}} Kutuzov's plan was to retreat farther to the rear where the Allied Army had a sharp {{advantage}} in logistics. Had the Allied Army retreated further, they might have been reinforced by Archduke Charles's troops from Italy, and the Prussians might have joined the coalition against Napoleon. A French army {{at the end of her}} supply lines, in a place which had no food supplies, might have faced <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> ending from the one they achieved at the real battle of Austerlitz. This essentially was Kutuzov's successful strategy in 1812, after the Battle of Borodino.|$|E
