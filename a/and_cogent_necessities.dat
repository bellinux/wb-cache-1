40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of mobile phase composition on the retention of phenolic acids and flavonoid compounds on five different hydrosilated silica-based stationary phases in buffered aqueous acetonitrile. Cogent UDC cholesterolTM, Cogent bidentate C 18 TM <b>and</b> <b>Cogent</b> Phenyl hydrideTM columns show significant dual reversed-phase/normal-phase retention behavior, while <b>Cogent</b> Diamond hydrideTM <b>and</b> <b>Cogent</b> Silica-CTM columns provide very low retention in the reversed-phase mode. The effect of the aqueous acetate buffer concentration on retention factors of phenolic acids and flavonoid compounds over the full mobile phase composition range, including both aqueous normal-phase (ANP) and reversed-phase (RP) mechanisms, can be described by a four-parameter equation for dual-retention mechanism. At increasing temperature, the retention factors and peak widths decrease in the aqueous normal-phase range. In agreement with van’t Hoff model, linear ln k versus 1 /T plots were observed, showing a single retention mechanism. From among the stationary phases tested, Cogent UDC cholesterolTM column has high temperature stability (up to 100 /C) and provides most selective and efficient separations of flavones in the ANP mode <b>and</b> <b>Cogent</b> Diamond hydrideTM is the most selective and effective for separation of phenolic acids...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{examine a}} {{possibility}} {{to explain the}} signals of dark matter direct detection from DAMA <b>and</b> <b>CoGeNT</b> experiments, under the framework of supersymmetric extension of the standard model. For this purpose, we introduce four Higgs doublet fields and assume that one pair of Higgs fields which have very small vacuum expectation values gives sizable effects for annihilation and scattering processes of dark matter. We show that the preferred parameter regions for DAMA <b>and</b> <b>CoGeNT</b> results can be simultaneously explained by supersymmetric four-Higgs doublet model with the parameters consistent with the observed value of dark matter relic abundance. The extra Higgs fields introduced as {{an explanation of the}} light dark matter scenario also explain the Wjj anomaly reported by CDF. ar X i...|$|R

For example, <b>Cogent</b> <b>and</b> Sprint-Nextel terminated their peering relationship in 2008 after {{they failed to}} resolve a peering dispute.

MacSHAPA is designed for observational data analysis, <b>and</b> <b>COGENT</b> is designed for knowledge elicitation and cognitive engineering, but both support requirements gathering.

40|$|In the {{scenario}} of isospin-violating dark matter (IVDM), {{the dark matter}} (DM) spin-independent couplings to protons and to neutrons are allowed to be different, which has been considered to relax the tensions between the results of DAMA, <b>CoGeNT</b> <b>and</b> XENON experiments. We explore the allowed values of DM-nucleon couplings favored and excluded by the current experiments under the assumption of IVDM. We find that the recently updated XENON 100 result excludes {{the main part of}} the overlapping signal region between DAMA <b>and</b> <b>CoGeNT.</b> The mass of the IVDM is restricted to a narrow range near 7. 5 - 8 GeV. We also show that the possible tensions between some experiments such as that between DAMA and SIMPLE are unlikely to be affected by isospin violating interactions. In an effective operator approach, we investigate conservative upper bounds on the DM-quark couplings required by the IVDM scenario from the cosmic ray antiproton fluxes measured recently by BESS-Polar II and PAMELA, and that from the relic density. The results show that the relatively large couplings favored by DAMA <b>and</b> <b>CoGeNT</b> are tightly constrained, if the operators contribute to velocity-independent annihilation cross sections. For thermal relic DM, the upper bounds from the relic density can also be stringent. Comment: 26 pages, 8 figs, match the published versio...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{model for}} {{magnetic}} inelastic dark matter (MiDM), {{which is a}} minimal extension of the standard model with right-handed neutrinos (N_R), a singly charged scalar (S) and a vector-like charged fermion (E), has been presented. In this framework in which dark matter inelastically scatters off nuclei through a magnetic dipole interaction by making a transition to a nearly degenerate state with a mass splitting (δ) of 100 keV. The model is constrained from Direct detection experiments, DAMA <b>and</b> <b>COGENT.</b> In our analysis we do not find any parameter space using the recent annual modulation data from <b>COGENT,</b> where DAMA <b>and</b> <b>COGENT</b> are consistent with each other. The bound from relic density provides a much stronger constraint.
