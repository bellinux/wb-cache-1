5000|$|TCP {{provides}} a checksum {{for protecting the}} payload and <b>addressing</b> <b>information</b> from the TCP and IP headers. Packets with incorrect checksums are discarded within the network stack, and eventually get retransmitted using ARQ, either explicitly (such as through triple-ack) or implicitly due to a timeout.|$|E
5000|$|Less {{overhead}} is required, {{since the}} packets are not routed individually and complete <b>addressing</b> <b>information</b> is not {{provided in the}} header of each data packet.

40|$|The {{address signal}} lines are {{connected}} to a semiconductor memory device when they are implemented on the PCB (Printed Circuit Board). So they experience the wiring capacitance and due to this wiring capacitance on printed circuit board the rising and falling time of respective address signal disperse. If the address signal lines change in timing, the following problem occurs. When a microprocessor connected to a semiconductor memory device changes the <b>address</b> <b>information</b> from one <b>address</b> to another address, due to deviation of timing of the change of the signal, the wrong address is generated. In an Asynchronous semiconductor memory device, the change of address is immediately responded. So it also responds to such wrong <b>address</b> <b>information</b> and internal circuit selects the wrong <b>address</b> <b>information</b> and operates corresponds to that wrong address...|$|R

5000|$|DVD+R and DVD+RW have a {{constant}} wobble frequency of 817.4 kHz, but encodes its <b>addressing</b> <b>information</b> by periodically inverting {{the phase of}} the wobble signal (bi-phase modulation) to encode an exact address of the location on the spiral track (Address in Pregroove).

50|$|InterSwitch Trunk (IST) is {{one or more}} {{parallel}} point-to-point links (Link aggregation) {{that connect}} two switches {{together to create a}} single logical switch. The IST allows the two switches to share <b>addressing</b> <b>information,</b> forwarding tables, and state information, permitting rapid (less than one second) fault detection and forwarding path modification. The link may have different names depending on the vendor. For example, Brocade calls this an Inter-Chassis Link (ICL). Cisco calls this a VSL (Virtual Switch Link).|$|E

5000|$|NT {{stands for}} Non-Tracking, meaning the head does not {{precisely}} follow the tracks on the tape. Instead, the head moves over the tape at approximately the correct angle and speed, but performs {{more than one}} pass over each track. The data in each track is stored on the tape in blocks with <b>addressing</b> <b>information</b> that enables reconstruction in memory from several passes. This considerably reduced the required mechanical precision, reducing the complexity, size, and cost of the recorder.|$|E
50|$|R2 {{register}} signalling {{is a family}} of protocols that govern the conveyance of <b>addressing</b> <b>information</b> during the addressing phase and how the call attempt turned out during the disposition phase. Although in the 1960s R2 {{register signalling}} was represented by electromechanical devices that could generate multi-frequency audio tones and by electromechanical devices that could detect those audio tones, by the latter 1970s these electromechanical registers also could be represented by digitized PCM audio in DS0 channels of an E1 other than the R2 line signalling DS0 channel in that E1.|$|E

Address elements are updated by means of matching with the address tree layer by layer. Then, by defining four types of positional relations, corresponding set are selected from standard POI library as candidate for enrichment and amendment of non-standard address. At last, the fast standardized processing of POI <b>address</b> <b>information</b> was achieved with the help of backtracking address elements with minimum granularity. Experiments in this paper proved that the standardization processing of an address can be realized by means of this method with higher accuracy in order to build the address database...|$|R
