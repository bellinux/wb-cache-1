50|$|A Snap-fit (Integral <b>Attachment</b> <b>Feature)</b> is an {{assembly}} method used to attach flexible parts, usually plastic, {{to form the}} final product by pushing the parts' interlocking components together. There {{are a number of}} variations in snap fits, including cantilever, torsional and annular. Snap fits are an alternative to assembly using nails or screws, and have the advantages of speed and no loose parts. Snap fit connectors can be found in everyday products such as battery compartment lids, Snap fasteners and Pens.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{integral}} <b>attachment</b> <b>features</b> in {{the form}} of snap-fits in assemblies comprised of plastic parts is proliferating. At the highest (i. e., attachment) level, the fundamental (or representative) shape of base and mating parts, imposed or selected installation direction and assembly motion, and possible and preferred attachment combinations must all be determined. Once this is done, decisions must be made on what specific types and forms of locking, locating, and enhancement <b>attachment</b> <b>features</b> are most appropriate for the application. This paper focuses on the issues that affect locking feature selection. Introduction Integral <b>attachment</b> <b>features</b> refer to all design elements on the interfaces of mating parts that guide, assist, and/or accomplish engagement during assembly without separate fasteners. Integral <b>attachment</b> <b>features</b> have been divided into three types based on their principal function, namely: (1) locking features, (2) locating features, and (3) compliant features [1 [...] ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{volume of}} {{biomedical}} literature has experienced explosive growth in recent years. This {{is reflected in}} the corresponding increase in the size of MEDLINE®, the largest bibliographic database of biomedical citations. Indexers at the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) need efficient tools to help them accommodate the ensuing workload. After reviewing issues in the automatic assignment of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH® terms) to biomedical text, we focus more specifically on the new subheading <b>attachment</b> <b>feature</b> for NLM’s Medical Text Indexer (MTI). Natural Language Processing, statistical, and machine learning methods of producing automatic MeSH main heading/subheading pair recommendations were assessed independently and combined. The best combination achieves 48 % precision and 30 % recall. After validation by NLM indexers, a suitable combination of the methods presented in this paper was integrated into MTI as a subheading <b>attachment</b> <b>feature</b> producing MeSH indexing recommendations compliant with current state-of-the-art indexing practice...|$|E
40|$|Integral {{attachment}} {{features are}} a growing method of joining plastic parts. Guidelines and equations that can predict {{the performance of}} features are needed for more efficient design. A design of experiments approach {{has been used to}} generate approximate second-order equations (response surfaces) which can calculate the insertion and retention forces for the compressive hook integral <b>attachment</b> <b>feature.</b> The data for this investigation was generated using finite element methods. The response equations are based on geometric and material properties of the feature and have been compared to supplemental FEM and experimental results. The results show that in the range of the equation, we can predict FEM results within 10 % for feature retention. Guidelines for designing features have also been stated. These results can enhance the performance of the compressive hook feature through an improved design.

40|$|Informal carers {{provide the}} {{majority}} of care to older Australians and {{play a key role}} in the co-ordination of formal care services. The role of carers is not only fundamental to those they care for, but for the functioning of the aged care system as a whole. The intrinsic nature of care is relational. Care occurs primarily in the context of long-term, pre-existing relationships. Family ties and emotional <b>attachment</b> <b>feature</b> strongly as reasons Australian carers take on the role of primary carer. The focus of the Home Care Package (HCP) program is on the 2 ̆ 7 individual 2 ̆ 7 older person who is the 2 ̆ 7 consumer 2 ̆ 7 directing the care. The older person has 2 ̆ 7 control 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 choice 2 ̆ 7 to purchase services from the open market of aged care providers. The HCP Program reform largely ignores the relationship experience, knowledge and key role of unpaid family, friends or neighbours who are providing significant levels of care to maintain the older person in their home. As demand for home based care increases due to an ageing population and further deinstitutionalisation of aged care services, supply of people willing to take on the role of informal carer is diminishing. Re-focusing HCP policy on informal care relationships rather than labelling the carer and the care recipient as separate 2 ̆ 7 individuals 2 ̆ 7 is the key to improving carer wellbeing and the sustainability of the informal care relationships that maintain older people at home. Based on an international literature review and data from a study of care relationships findings relating to the current 2 ̆ 7 lived experience 2 ̆ 7 of carers and older people who are HCP recipients will be discussed. The concept of 2 ̆ 7 informal care networks 2 ̆ 7 will also be explored in relation to the role a range of informal carers play in supporting older relatives / friends to remain at home...|$|E

50|$|In {{the context}} of attachment, a {{hydraulic}} function consists of a valve on the forklift with a lever near the operator that provides two passages of pressurized hydraulic oil to power the <b>attachment</b> <b>features.</b> Sometimes an <b>attachment</b> has more <b>features</b> than your forklift has hydraulic functions and one or more need to be added. There are many ways of adding hydraulic functions (also known as adding a valve). The forklift manufacturer makes valves and hose routing accessories, but the parts and labor to install can be prohibitively expensive. Other ways include adding a solenoid valve {{in conjunction with a}} hose or cable reel that diverts oil flow from an existing function. However, hose and cable reels can block the operator's view and are problematic, easily damaged. The Ditto Valve kit uses a solenoid valve and special HydWire hoses, in which the wire reinforcing braid doubles as an electrical conduit. These hoses replace those already on the forklift, nesting in the original reeving, keeping it safe from damage and out of the operators field of vision.|$|R

Thewell-known <b>attachment</b> <b>features</b> of this animal result from the softness of the sucker tissues and the surfacemorphology of {{the portion of the}} sucker that is in contact with objects or substrates. Unlike artificial suction cups, octopus suckers are characterized by a series of radial grooves that increase the area subjected to pressure reduction during attachment. In this study, we constructed artificial suction cupswith different surface geometries and tested their attachment performances using a pull-off setup. First, smooth suction cupswere obtained for casting; then, sucker surfaces were engravedwith a laser cutter. As expected, for all the tested cases, the engraving treatment enhanced the attachment performance of the elastomeric suction cups comparedwith that of the smooth versions. Moreover, the results indicated that the surface geometry with the best attachment performance was the geometrymost similar to octopus suckermorphology. The results obtained in this work can be utilized to design artificial suction cupswith higherwet attachment performance. 1...|$|R
