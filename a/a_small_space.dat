5|$|Data {{collected}} by land locations coding in METAR are conveyed worldwide via phone lines or wireless technology. Within many nations' meteorological organizations, this data is then plotted onto a weather map using the station model. A station {{model is a}} symbolic illustration showing the weather occurring at a given reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to plot a number of weather elements in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>space</b> on weather maps. Maps filled with dense station-model plots {{can be difficult to}} read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, station {{models are}} {{symbolic}} illustrations showing the weather occurring {{at a given}} reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to fit a number of weather elements into <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>space</b> on weather maps. This allows map users to analyze patterns in atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind speed & direction, cloud cover, precipitation, and other parameters. The most common station plots depict surface weather observations although upper air plots at various mandatory levels are also frequently depicted.|$|E
5|$|The Gateway Foundation already owned {{two of the}} {{two dozen}} pieces prior to Citygarden's creation, and it {{purchased}} the remaining number between 2006 and 2009. The organization has not revealed the cost of acquiring the sculptures, an amount {{not included in the}} $30 million; however, it is estimated that the collection is worth around $12 million, if not more. The garden has received criticism from those who think that 24 sculptures is too many in such <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{station model}} is a {{symbolic}} illustration showing the weather occurring at a given reporting station.

Maps filled with dense station-model plots {{can be difficult to}} read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns. A computer draws a station model for each observation location. The station model is primarily used on surface-weather maps, but {{can also be used to}} show the weather aloft. A completed station-model map allows users to analyze patterns in air pressure, temperature, wind, cloud cover, and precipitation.|$|E
5|$|In 2029, {{aboard the}} United States Air Force space station Oberon, Leo Davidson {{works closely with}} {{primates}} who are trained for space missions. His favorite simian co-worker is a chimpanzee named Pericles. With a deadly electromagnetic storm approaching the station, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>space</b> pod piloted by Pericles is used to probe the storm. Pericles's pod heads into the storm and disappears. Against his commanding officer's orders, Leo takes a second pod and goes in pursuit of Pericles. Entering the storm, Leo loses contact with the Oberon and crashes on a planet called Ashlar in the year 5021. He discovers {{that the world is}} ruled by humanoid apes who speak English, use domesticated horses for transportation, and treat human beings as slaves.|$|E
5|$|The Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) Chicago {{was created}} {{as the result}} of a 1964 meeting of 30 critics, {{collectors}} and dealers at the home of critic Doris Lane Butler to bring the long-discussed idea of a museum of contemporary art to complement the city's Art Institute of Chicago, according to a grand opening story in Time. It opened in fall 1967 in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>space</b> at 237 East Ontario Street that had for a time served as the corporate offices of Playboy Enterprises. Its first director was Jan van der Marck. In 1970 he invited Wolf Vostell to make the Concrete Traffic sculpture in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|By 24–28days after hatching, {{the young}} birds start to perch on {{branches}} near the nest {{and take their}} first flight. They are fed by their parents for a further 28–30days, staying close to the nest while growing and practicing flying. At this stage they are extremely vocal, and their cries to their parents can often be heard a considerable distance away. The young hawks disperse after their parents stop provisioning them. Though they receive {{the same amount of}} food, male chicks (roughly half the size of females) mature more quickly and seem to be ready to leave the nest sooner. In a study in the Forest of Ae, south-west Scotland, it was found that 21% of nestlings over two days old died, with the causes of death being starvation, wet weather, predation and desertion by the parents. The parasite Leucocytozoon toddi can be passed from parent to nestling at the nest, possibly {{because of the number of}} birds sharing <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>space,</b> thus allowing transmission.|$|E

40|$|Two {{possible}} reasons of the MTC underestimation by noise analysis are investigated: the deviation from point-kinetics of the reactor response, {{and the effect}} of randomly distributed (both in time and in space) noise sources. The strong deviation of the MTC noise estimate from its actual value is found to be mainly due to the heterogeneous structure of the temperature noise. The spatial heterogeneous temperature noise distribution gives both <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> (<b>space</b> independent) reactivity effect, and <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> (<b>space</b> dependent) cross-power spectrum density between neutron and temperature noise, in comparison with homogeneous noise sources, on which the MTC definition relies...|$|R

25|$|Black labor {{played a}} crucial role in Miami's early development.

25|$|The plant's {{small size}} and rapid {{lifecycle}} are also advantageous for research. Having specialized as a spring ephemeral, {{it has been}} used to found several laboratory strains that take about six weeks from germination to mature seed. The small size of the plant is convenient for cultivation in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>space,</b> and it produces many seeds. Further, the selfing nature of this plant assists genetic experiments. Also, as an individual plant can produce several thousand seeds; each of the above criteria leads to A. thaliana being valued as a genetic model organism.|$|E
25|$|At a {{chemical}} synapse, one neuron releases neurotransmitter molecules into <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>space</b> (the synaptic cleft) that is adjacent to another neuron. The neurotransmitters are kept within small sacs called vesicles, and are {{released into the}} synaptic cleft by exocytosis. These molecules then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell's side of the synaptic cleft. Finally, the neurotransmitters must be cleared from the synapse through one of several potential mechanisms including enzymatic degradation or re-uptake by specific transporters either on the presynaptic cell or possibly by neuroglia to terminate {{the action of the}} transmitter.|$|E
