25|$|Following {{another round}} of booing and the {{throwing}} of more cans, Illingworth ordered and led his men from the field <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that {{to some of them}} he had to repeat his order at least twice...Had the Englishmen remained on the field I doubt whether play could have resumed.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell {{coaches in}} a quiet and {{cerebral}} style which he picked up from the first head coach under who he worked, saying with typical understatement, [...] "Coach Bryant wasn't a screamer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> he had some success." [...] He has further described his approach to coaching thusly: ...|$|E
500|$|Herc {{carefully}} {{studied the}} dancers. [...] "I was smoking cigarettes and I {{was waiting for}} the records to finish. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> people was waiting for certain parts of the record," [...] he says. It was an insight as profound as Ruddy Redwood's dub discovery. The moment when the dancers really got wild was in a song's short instrumental break, when the band would drop out and the rhythm section would get elemental. Forget melody, chorus, songs—it was all about the groove, building it, keeping it going. Like a string theorist, Herc zeroed in on the fundamental vibrating loop {{at the heart of the}} record, the break.|$|E
6000|$|... "Another thing----Heaven knows I {{never want}} to start trouble, but I can't help what I see from my back steps, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> your hired girl Bea {{carrying}} on with the grocery boys and all----" ...|$|R
60|$|Every now {{and again}} she looks towards the door and listens: then turns to the open window. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> that each time she looks towards the door the evil in her face shrinks back; but each time she turns to the window it grows more fierce and sullen.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that Superstition {{stood in}} the light of the doorway looking down on us.|$|R
2500|$|Having {{the home}} {{recording}} system also proved useful for production, the band {{felt that it}} would not only benefit themselves, but other local bands who could not afford the studio prices, even in the Welwyn Garden City area. It was here that Billy and Charlotte both stumbled upon the opportunity that would eventually prove significant for the band. [...] "I was producing a local Welwyn Garden City band in my front lounge one day <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that it was quite good so I asked {{if they were going to}} send it to any London venues, because I knew a few that would like it. They said that they were going to send it off to Michael Eavis who runs Glastonbury Festival, and I asked why..." [...] Michael Eavis that year was running an unsigned bands competition to play on the Other Stage, and The Subways decided that would be a great idea. [...] "It was really just another address to send one of our CDs off to. All we wanted was to play shows and this was another great opportunity. The CD we sent off to Michael Eavis was literally one among a bunch of 30 that were being sent out to London promoters for a load of gigs we wanted to book. We never expected the phone call saying that we'd won and were to play Glastonbury", said Cooper on radio. The Subways remain friends with Eavis today, and have suggested that other upcoming bands should send demos to Eavis.|$|E
60|$|He {{touched his}} right hand lightly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> {{for the first time}} that it was bandaged up.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me more attentively, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> a quick {{movement}} of her hands towards each other.|$|E
60|$|We talked {{along for}} half an hour, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that he looked tired, and spoke of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Pappoose!' says John Tom, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> {{that the}} flowers {{of the white}} man's syntax have left his tongue. He is the {{original}} proposition in bear's claws and copper color. 'Me bring,' says he, and he lays the kid in his mother's arms. 'Run fifteen mile,' says John Tom--'Ugh! Catch white man. Bring pappoose.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suspect so," [...] replied Tom, [...] "and it {{does not}} raise my spirits to see Saunders shaking his huge visage so portentously. Do you know, I have a great belief in that fellow. He seems to know {{everything}} and to have gone through every sort of experience, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> {{that most of his}} prognostications come to pass." ...|$|R
60|$|He ground {{his teeth}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> in the gaslight that {{his face was}} ghastly pale and his lips were blue.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> as I {{kissed my}} dear that she lay {{with one hand}} under her pillow {{so that it was}} hidden.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Baas, everything," [...] he answered, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that he {{kept his}} eyes fixed upon the ground and that his lips twitched.|$|E
5000|$|... 'A dancer {{must have}} {{tremendous}} personality. A God like Christ {{and even a}} godman like Rajneesh had some personality. Combination of talent, dedication, creativity and being emotive is imperative. A coupling of these four qualities with technique is essential. Monotony is deterrent as it regards your style <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> today, that new dancers perform in a startlingly similar fashion.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Mr. Palliser {{was asking}} {{if you were}} up, sir, and they’re getting breakfast now,” he said, and then glanced at the clothes. “I’ve been giving them a brush. There was some mud on the trousers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> a seam split in the coat. I could ask one of the maids to put a stitch in it before it gets worse.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{all very}} mysterious," [...] she said. [...] "I do not {{understand}} it at all. We seem to be almost in hiding here, seeing no one and going nowhere. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> that Major Forrest, whenever he walks even in the garden, is always looking around {{as though he were}} afraid of something. What did you quarrel with Lord Ronald about?" ...|$|R
60|$|Lord Langerdale {{shook his}} head, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that {{he failed to}} {{look me in the}} face. I braced myself up with a great effort.|$|E
60|$|It {{was four}} bells. Louis came aft {{to relieve the}} wheel. There was a {{dampness}} in the air, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> he had on his oilskins.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you think}} you might be mistaken in your {{identification}} of Mr. Stumpy?" [...] he replied, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that again he nearly stumbled in pronouncing the tramp's name.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the main}} themes in The Doug Anthony All Stars CD/video release Dead & Alive is necrophilia. [...] "Necrophilia comes from the Latin 'necros' meaning 'dead' and 'philia,' the verb, 'to fill.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> when <b>I</b> say that word 'necrophilia,' {{a lot of the}} younger people up the front visibly stiffen. The older mob up the back begin to look a bit scared. And quite rightly so." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> turned, <b>and</b> saw my uncle. He was {{disguised}} in {{a costume}} of reddish-brown cloth. [...] "Golf here?" [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> the tricycle. [...] "A vagrom man on wheels!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> obeyed: <b>and,</b> in passing, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> {{he breathed}} {{as fast as}} a cat.|$|R
60|$|She {{lifted her}} little hand and saluted him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> {{that it was}} after another fashion {{to that of the}} Kaffirs who lived thereabouts, after the Zulu fashion indeed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't," [...] {{her mother}} advised. [...] "He hates {{anything}} {{that sounds like}} an epigram, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that he avoided any allusion to his birthday last month. Any news, dear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the figure}} urged the weary horse and {{advanced}} slowly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> {{that it was}} very small. [...] "A boy," [...] I thought to myself, [...] "who is bringing some message." ...|$|E
6000|$|I have {{traveled}} {{more than anyone}} else, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>noticed</b> that even the angels speak English with an accent. [...] --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.|$|R
50|$|During {{his stay}} in Frankenthal from 1588 to 1595, he {{influenced}} several better known Flemish émigré landscape painters, {{who are now}} collectively {{referred to as the}} 'Frankenthal School'. The early 17th century art historian Karel van Mander wrote about Coninxloo in his Schilder-boeck. Van Mander stated that Coninxloo's teacher Pieter Coeke van Aelst was his cousin, <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> know at this time of no better landscape painter, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> that they are following his manner very much in Holland.|$|R
6000|$|... "Father didn't do it yesterday; it's his work; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>notice</b> it. You know—Father often forgets—he doesn't {{like to have}} to work in the afternoon, now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Martin {{took his}} seat astride of an African tom-tom or drum; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> {{at the time}} that Jean Marie's naked foot hung down from the {{cross-beam}} almost directly over Martin's head.|$|E
6000|$|... "'None of {{the ladies}} made the smear,' Penelope answered. 'I left Miss Rachel in bed at twelve last night. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> the door, {{and there was nothing}} wrong with it then.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who are you?" [...] asked Captain Flagg of Captain Hannock; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that Mr. Henshaw {{had laid}} aside his navy-blue suit and badge, and was {{standing}} by apparently as an ordinary passenger.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have brought}} good luck, Master Conway; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>notices</b> <b>I</b> {{generally}} do well {{when you are}} out with me. I am getting more fish to-night than I have any night for weeks, and if it goes on like this till morning I shall make a good thing of it. I wants it bad enough, for I am in arrears a bit with my rent. The war has made everything so terrible dear that it is {{as much as a}} poor man can do to keep his head above water.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the name}} of the People and by the order of the Committee of Public Safety!" [...] said one of the men, who stood in the forefront, <b>and</b> who, <b>I</b> <b>noticed,</b> had a corporal's stripe on his left sleeve.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shoo--shoo--shoo!" [...] cried Scraps, {{dancing around}} and laughing. [...] "And your horrid green eyes, Miss Bungle! You can't see your eyes, but we can, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> you're {{very proud of}} what little color you have. Shoo, Miss Bungle, shoo--shoo--shoo! If you were all colors and many colors, as I am, you'd be too stuck up for anything." [...] She leaped over the cat and back again, and the startled Bungle crept close to a tree to escape her. This made Scraps laugh more heartily than ever, and she said: ...|$|R
