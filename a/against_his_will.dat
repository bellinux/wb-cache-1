5|$|Shortly {{before his}} marriage, Kurosawa was {{pressured}} by the studio <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will</b> {{to direct a}} sequel to his debut film. The often blatantly propagandistic Sanshiro Sugata Part II, which premiered in May 1945, is generally considered one of his weakest pictures.|$|E
5|$|<b>Against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will,</b> Gygax {{was back}} in charge again; he {{immediately}} looked for a quick product to get NIPI off the ground. He had retained the rights to Gord the Rogue {{as part of his}} severance agreement with TSR, so he licensed Greyhawk from TSR and started writing new novels beginning with Sea of Death (1987); sales were brisk, and Gygax's Gord the Rogue novels ended up keeping New Infinities in business.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Khánh had {{not spoken}} up and allowed the {{impression}} that the moves had been made without his consultation or <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will,</b> and an attempt on the part of other officers to take power themselves. Hương had actually privately endorsed the dissolution of the HNC, as both he and the Young Turks thought it would allow them to gain more power and influence over Khánh.|$|E
50|$|The play {{concludes with}} Phao leaving Sicily; Cupid rebels <b>against</b> <b>his</b> mother's <b>will</b> and remains with Sapho, {{adopting}} her as his new mother.|$|R
5000|$|A slave {{could be}} freed <b>against</b> <b>his</b> master's <b>will</b> by denouncing a forced rape, by denouncing a counterfeiter, by {{discovering}} disloyalty against the king, and by denouncing murder <b>against</b> <b>his</b> master.|$|R
5000|$|Antinous ( [...] Ἀντίνους) was a {{chief among}} the Molossians in Epirus, who became involved, <b>against</b> <b>his</b> own <b>will,</b> in the Third Macedonian War of Perseus of Macedon against the Romans.|$|R
5|$|According to Maple's account, in {{the last}} few weeks of Pickingill's life, when he had become very ill, the local people moved him to the {{infirmary}} <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will,</b> where he declared that at his funeral there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers. Many locals interpreted this as coming true when as the hearse carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped out of their harness shafts. His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.|$|E
5|$|At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own {{authority}} over his pirate crew. He {{told the court}} that his crew engaged in piracy <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will,</b> {{and said he had}} warned them that he would leave the crew unless they stopped robbing vessels. He further stated that he had been asleep during the capture of the sloop Francis. The court did not accept these protestations. Boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that Bonnet's quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. A powerful quartermaster {{appears to have been a}} common feature of pirate crews in the early modern era.|$|E
5|$|During the Confederate {{incursion}} {{into the}} North in mid-1863 {{that culminated in}} the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederates twice sent parties to Stevens's Caledonia Forge. Stevens, who had been there supervising operations, was hastened away by his workers <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will.</b> General Jubal Early looted and vandalized the Forge, causing a loss to Stevens of about $80,000. Early said that the North {{had done the same}} to southern figures, and that Stevens was well known for his vindictiveness towards the South. Asked if he would have taken the congressman to Libby Prison in Richmond, Early replied that he would have hanged Stevens and divided his bones among the Confederate states.|$|E
5000|$|Wang Po-chieh as Li Chongguang (李重光), Li Yutang's 17-year-old only son. He goes <b>against</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>will</b> to show <b>his</b> fervent {{support for}} the revolution. He sacrifices himself to protect Sun Wen by acting as a decoy to divert the assassins.|$|R
60|$|I was aroused {{from these}} consoling {{reflections}} by {{the voice of}} Mr. Bruff. My meditative silence appeared to weigh upon the spirits of this worldling, and to force him, as it were, into talking to me <b>against</b> <b>his</b> own <b>will.</b>|$|R
50|$|Impeccability is {{the absence}} of sin. Christianity teaches this to be an {{attribute}} of God (logically God cannot sin, it would mean that he would act <b>against</b> <b>his</b> own <b>will</b> and nature) and therefore it is also commonly, but not uncontroversially, attributed to Christ.|$|R
5|$|Itachi reappears later {{during the}} Fourth Great Ninja War, brought back by Kabuto Yakushi using the , a {{forbidden}} summoning jutsu {{that brings the}} dead back as immortal corpses, to fight on Tobi's side. Paired with Nagato and forced to fight Naruto and Killer Bee <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will,</b> Itachi learns of his brother's intentions and summons the crow he gave Naruto to regain his free will. After sealing Nagato, Itachi heads out to stop Kabuto and encounters Sasuke, with his younger brother wanting {{to know the truth}} once it is over.|$|E
5|$|Later, Gil {{is taken}} to a {{solarium}} to receive the sun's healing rays. While he naps, he transforms into a reptilian creature, horrifying the other patients. Fleeing from the scene, Gil discovers his new appearance. Stern notifies Ann and Dr. Buckell about the incident, theorizing that the exposure to radiation caused a reversal of evolution, transforming Gil into a prehistoric reptile after exposure to sunlight. Stern suggests that Gil can control his symptoms by staying {{in the dark and}} remaining in the hospital, but admits that the patient cannot be held <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will.</b>|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Æthelberht's life or reign, as very few East Anglian records have survived from this period. Mediaeval chroniclers have {{provided}} dubious accounts of his life, {{in the absence of}} any real details. According to Richard of Cirencester, writing in the fifteenth century, Æthelberht's parents were Æthelred I of East Anglia and Leofrana of Mercia. Richard narrates in detail a story of Æthelberht's piety, election as king and wise rule. Urged to marry <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will,</b> he apparently agreed to wed Eadburh, the daughter of Offa of Mercia, and set out to visit her, despite his mother's forebodings and his experiences of terrifying events (an earthquake, a solar eclipse and a vision).|$|E
50|$|Pintya gets {{married to}} Sunita <b>against</b> <b>his</b> mother's <b>will.</b> Initially, {{there is a}} heavy clash between Kala and Sunita, but Sadashiv {{resolves}} it forcibly.

50|$|After Robert's death, the Lannisters make Joffrey King <b>against</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>will,</b> and <b>his</b> mother uses {{him as a}} puppet. A cruel ruler, Joffrey makes {{a mistake}} when, against Cersei's and Sansa's wishes, he refuses to honor his promise of sparing Ned; instead, Joffrey has him executed.|$|R
5|$|The {{sovereign}} however may remove {{an individual}} from the Privy Council. On 8 June 2011, the former MP Elliot Morley was expelled following his conviction {{on charges of}} false accounting {{in connection with the}} British parliamentary expenses scandal. Before this, the last individual to be expelled from the Council <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will</b> was Sir Edgar Speyer, Bt., who was removed on 13 December 1921 for collaborating with the enemy German Empire, during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Tyrion asks Tywin to {{be named}} heir to House Lannister's ancestral home Casterly Rock. Tywin angrily refuses and threatens to hang Shae if she is found in his bed again, but does have Tyrion named as Master of Coin, the treasurer. He also forces Tyrion to marry Sansa Stark <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will,</b> though both decide not to consummate the marriage. Tyrion and Sansa begin to bond as they are both outcasts in King's Landing, until Sansa discovers that her mother Catelyn and brother Robb have been murdered {{as a result of}} Tywin's scheming.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1945, the ACLU {{had taken a}} stand {{to protect the rights}} of the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute {{governing}} mental commitments. In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed involuntary commitments, unless it could be demonstrated that the person was a danger to himself or the community. In the landmark 1975 O'Connor v. Donaldson decision the ACLU represented a non-violent mental health patient who had been confined <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will</b> for 15 years, and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal. The ACLU has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous, but who create disturbances. The New York chapter of the ACLU defended Billie Boggs, a mentally ill woman who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Mrs. Morel was {{trembling}} violently. Struggles {{of this kind}} often took place {{between her and her}} son, when she seemed to fight for <b>his</b> very life <b>against</b> <b>his</b> own <b>will</b> to die. He took her in his arms. She was ill and pitiful.|$|R
60|$|Returning {{to the big}} chair, he, {{speaking}} of truth and the like in literature, said that an autobiography was the one work in which a man, <b>against</b> <b>his</b> own <b>will</b> {{and in spite of}} his utmost striving to the contrary, revealed himself in his true light to the world.|$|R
50|$|Hugh Smallen {{was part}} of the second wave of modernist architects to live and {{practice}} in New Canaan, Connecticut, and was born May 6, 1919 in New York City. He decided to pursue a major in architecture at Yale University <b>against</b> <b>his</b> father’s <b>will.</b> <b>His</b> education was interrupted when he was needed in World War II where he served as an aerial photographer.|$|R
5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door {{to catch a glimpse}} of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will</b> and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E
5|$|Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru {{revolves}} around the main protagonist Mizuho Miyanokouji, a male high school student. After Mizuho's grandfather dies, his will is reviewed, which explains his desire to have his grandson transfer to Seio Girls' Academy, the same one his own mother attended and his ancestors founded. Abiding by the will, Mizuho cross-dresses to attend the school. The headmistress, the deputy head teacher (visual novel only), Mizuho's homeroom teacher Hisako Kajiura and Mariya Mikado initially know his secret; Shion Jujo and Ichiko Takashima also eventually find this out. Mizuho is very popular among the other students, who often talk about how pretty, nice, and athletic Mizuho is. This rampant popularity escalates to him even being nominated <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will</b> to join in on the Elder election. By these terms, the current student council president, Takako Itsukushima, runs against Mizuho.|$|E
5|$|Skye {{tries to}} defend them both, {{but when the}} team finds {{evidence}} that Lydon was paid substantially for the information, she turns on him and cooperates with the agents. The team tracks the buyer, Raina, to a Project Centipede facility in Hong Kong, where they are draining Chan's fire-resistant platelets <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will,</b> to use as stabilizers for the extremis serum within their super-soldiers. Chan, angry with this betrayal and with S.H.I.E.L.D. for constricting him, attacks both. He kills, among others, Quan and the Centipede head doctor Debbie. Realizing that Chan can't be reasoned with, Coulson and May inject him with a large dose of extremis, causing him to explode. Lydon, convinced that what he did is harming people, helps by using his hacking skills to direct the blast through the ventilation and out {{the top of the}} building, while the others escape to safety.|$|E
5000|$|As the war turns <b>against</b> him, <b>his</b> {{emotions}} <b>will</b> intensify {{and will}} have outbursts more frequently. <b>His</b> public appearances <b>will</b> become much rarer, because he's unable to face a critical audience.|$|R
50|$|At {{the death}} of Count Lexa von Aehrenthal in February 1912, Count Berchtold was {{appointed}} as his successor and thus became, {{at the age of}} 49, the youngest foreign minister in Europe. His appointment reportedly came <b>against</b> <b>his</b> own <b>will</b> and despite lack of experience in domestic affairs, as well as in military matters.|$|R
50|$|After María {{moves into}} the del Olmo household, she {{falls in love with}} Jorge Luis, who is weak <b>against</b> <b>his</b> mother's <b>will</b> and always does as she wants. Malvina makes it her life's mission to antagonize María. When she finds out that María loves her son, she pushes him to marry her {{in order to get the}} money back.|$|R
5|$|The U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment {{gives an}} {{individual}} suspected of crime a {{right not to}} be forced, by police or other government officials, into giving up evidence that would show {{he or she was}} guilty of a crime. Based on this constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination and to prevent coerced testimony by police or other government officials, the Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona that an individual who was being held by police and was not free to leave had to be told of his/her right to remain silent. After Berghuis, a subsequent case, Salinas v. Texas, considered a suspect who was not being held <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will</b> by police officers, but who had instead agreed to accompany officers and discuss a case upon their request. It extended Berghuis by ruling that in such a situation and prior to any arrest, the individual was not required to be explicitly told about his/her right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Tony wanders in {{delirium}} {{until he}} is rescued by Mr. Todd, who rules over a small native tribe in a remote clearing in the jungle. Todd nurses Tony back to health. Although illiterate, Todd owns copies of the complete works of Charles Dickens, and asks Tony to read to him. However, when Tony's health recovers and he asks to be helped on his way, the old man repeatedly demurs. The readings continue, but the atmosphere becomes increasingly menacing as Tony realises he is being held <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will.</b> When a search party finally reaches the settlement, Todd arranges that Tony be drugged and kept hidden; he tells the party that Tony has died, and gives them his watch to take home. When Tony awakes he learns that his hopes of rescue are gone, {{and that he is}} condemned to read Dickens to his captor indefinitely. Back in England, Tony's death is accepted; Hetton passes to his cousins, who erect a memorial to his memory, while Brenda marries Tony's friend Jock Grant-Menzies.|$|E
5|$|Varno said he {{received}} uncredited assistance from {{his friends and}} fellow screenwriters Jerome Bixby and Harold Jacob Smith, the latter of whom won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film The Defiant Ones (1958). Varno ran lines and ideas by both men and sought advice. Smith in particular inspired lines for the speech made by the monster {{at the end of}} the film, in which the creature discusses how the human characters consider him the embodiment of evil simply because he is different from them. Varno said much of that dialogue from Smith, however, ended up getting cut from the final film. One of the primary themes of the film, as embodied in John Corcoran's attempts to defend the alien creature, was that simply because someone or something is ugly or different does not necessarily make it evil. However, the script also followed a common trait of most horror films of the 1950s that even somewhat understandable monsters are not entirely sympathetic, and the Blood Beast creature proves itself evil by impregnating Corcoran <b>against</b> <b>his</b> <b>will</b> and pursuing world domination.|$|E
50|$|The story {{takes place}} from 1825 to 1830, when Orsinia is {{ruled by the}} Austrian Empire. The hero is Itale Sorde, {{the son of the}} owner of an estate on a lake called Malafrena in a valley of the same name. Itale leaves the estate, <b>against</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>will,</b> to engage in nationalistic and revolutionary {{politics}} in the capital.|$|R

On {{the day of the}} wedding, Burdon learns that Margaret has married Haddo instead. Porhoet is convinced it was <b>against</b> <b>his</b> niece's <b>will,</b> and Burdon tries to track them down.|$|R
