5|$|ICD-10 {{includes}} in its diagnosis {{psychological and}} physical abuse and injury in addition to neglect. This is somewhat controversial, being a commission rather than omission and because abuse in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> {{does not lead to}} attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{intended}} just {{to convince}} Fox to fund some shooting in Paris, Frankel's sizzle reel led {{the studio to}} put a stronger marketing push behind the movie. It moved the release date from February to summer, scheduling it as a lighter alternative audiences could consider to Superman Returns {{at the end of}} June 2006, and began to position it as an event movie in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{it opened}} on 4 May 1789 at 52 Pall Mall, the Shakespeare Gallery {{contained}} 34 paintings {{and by the}} end of its run it had between 167 and 170. The Gallery itself was a hit with the public and became a fashionable attraction. It took over the public's imagination and became an end in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E

5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself,</b> but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E
25|$|There is pre-historic {{evidence}} that shows brewing began around 5400 BC in Sumer (southern Iraq). However, {{as with the}} history of corn whiskey, the production of other alcoholic beverages is often seen as a way to preserve excess grain, rather than an occupation in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} types of fever were known as early as 460 BC to 370 BC when Hippocrates was {{practicing}} medicine including that due to malaria (tertian or every 2 days and quartan or every 3 days). It also became clear around this time that fever was a symptom of disease rather than a disease in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
25|$|Just as open syllables {{have ten}} vowels, so too do closed syllables: /æ/ /ɪ/ /ɛ/ /u̯æ~ʊ/ /u̯ɛ/ /u̯ɪ/ /eɪ/ /oʊ/ /aɪ/ /aʊ/. It {{is worth noting}} that in Yangon MSB no vowel quality exists in both closed and open syllables, and that {{therefore}} nasalisation cannot be said to be a contrastive feature in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
25|$|Canada {{formally}} decriminalized mixed {{martial arts}} with {{a vote on}} Bill S-209 on June 5, 2013. The bill formally gives provinces the power to create athletic commissions to regulate and sanction professional mixed martial arts bouts. Bill S-209 does not in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> make MMA legal across Canada; it allows provinces to make it legal on a province by province basis.|$|E

25|$|A {{port scan}} or portscan {{is a process}} that sends client {{requests}} to a range of server port addresses on a host, with the goal of finding an active port; this is not a nefarious process in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b> The majority of uses of a port scan are not attacks, but rather simple probes to determine services available on a remote machine.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, (conservative) Religious Zionists {{differ with}} Modern Orthodoxy in its {{approach}} to secular knowledge. Here, engagement with the secular is permissible, and encouraged, but only insofar as this benefits the State of Israel; secular knowledge (or, at the least, an extensive secular education) is viewed as valuable for practical ends, though not in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b> See further under Torah Umadda.|$|E

25|$|While {{creating}} Still Life, Dimitris Papaioannou {{thought a}} lot about the human crave for meaning, and about the absurdity of the human condition, rooted in matter but yearning for spirit. He was thinking about Albert Camus, and about work as meaning in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b> At the same time, Dimitris Papaioannou concentrated deeply on simplicity, interaction with real materials, and silence — musically-composed silence.|$|E
25|$|In other words, once we've {{explained}} {{a perception}} fully {{in terms of}} how it affects us, there is nothing left to explain. In particular, {{there is no such thing}} as a perception which may be considered in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> (a quale). Instead, the subject's honest reports of how things seem to them are inherently authoritative on how things seem to them, but not on the matter of how things actually are.|$|E
25|$|Adam is {{the first}} human created by God. Though {{initially}} alone, Adam demands a mate from God. Considered God's prized creation, Adam, along with his wife, rules over all the creatures {{of the world and}} resides in the Garden of Eden. He is more gregarious than Eve, and yearns for her company. His complete infatuation with Eve, while pure in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself,</b> eventually contributes to his joining her in disobedience to God.|$|E

25|$|The still life, {{which had}} often been {{considered}} a minor genre, flourished throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. In Spain, this particular subject matter was termed bodegón and depicted in an austere gloomy style (tenebrismo). Van der Hamen was considered as the greatest Spanish still life painter of the seventeenth century, when that form was revived as a worthy subject in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> {{rather than as an}} adjunct to a symbolic or narrative work.|$|E
25|$|The term negrito {{was coined}} by the Spaniards {{based on their}} appearance. The word 'negrito' would be misinterpreted and used by future European {{scholars}} as an ethnoracial term in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b> Both Christianized negritos {{who lived in the}} colony and un-Christianized negritos who lived in tribes outside of the colony were classified as 'negritos'. Christianized negritos who lived in Manila were not allowed to enter Intramuros and lived in areas designated for indios.|$|E
25|$|Boeing was {{experienced}} at selling {{to the military}} but had not enjoyed the same success with civil airliners. This market was dominated by Douglas which was adept at {{meeting the needs of}} airlines by refining and developing its range of propeller-driven aircraft, and in 1950 was marketing the forthcoming DC-7. Boeing decided the only way to overcome the airlines' suspicion of the jet – <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> – was to show them a completed aircraft.|$|E
