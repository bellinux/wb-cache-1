5|$|A {{number of}} his trusted {{advisers}} were Hungarian, and he remained interested in Hungarian politics. Báthory wished to recreate his native country into an independent, strong power, but the unfavorable international situation did not allow him to significantly advance <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> plans in that area. In addition to Hungarian, he was well versed in Latin, and spoke Italian and German; he never learned the Polish language.|$|E
5|$|Although Jean-Jacques Dessalines, {{a pivotal}} {{figure in the}} Haitian Revolution, is barely {{mentioned}} in the novel, the one page dedicated to him emphasizes his connection to African gods while neglecting to mention <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> other features that made him an effective leader. While Dessaline's belief in African gods is highlighted, Henri Christophe's abandonment of the religion is stressed, being identified {{as the reason for}} his downfall.|$|E

5|$|As of May 2008, a {{film version}} of the comic is in the {{scripting}} stage, with Brian K. Vaughan writing and Kevin Feige, Marvel Studios President of Production, producing. Feige has said that while {{it may not be}} a precise story line of <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> comics, it will be similar to the tone or origins of its initial run.|$|E
5|$|Busoni's {{recorded}} output on {{gramophone record}} was very limited, {{and many of}} the original recordings were destroyed when the Columbia factory burnt down. Busoni mentions recording the Gounod-Liszt Faust Waltz {{in a letter to his}} wife in 1919. This recording was never released. He never recorded <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own works.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Kon {{released}} the 13-episode television series Paranoia Agent, in which Kon revisits {{the theme of}} the blending of imagination and reality, as well as working in additional social themes.

5|$|Siti Akbari {{was first}} {{published}} in four volumes in 1884. It proved to be Lie's most popular work, and received the most reprints out of <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> publications. The first reprinting was in 1913 by Hoa Siang In Kiok, and the second was in 1922 by Kho Tjeng Bie. Both of these new printings consisted of a single volume, and, according to Tio, contained numerous inaccuracies.|$|E
5|$|After Perceval's death, Parliament made generous {{provision}} to his widow and children, and approved the erection of monuments. Thereafter his ministry was soon forgotten, his policies reversed, {{and he is}} generally better known for the manner of his death than for <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> achievements. Later historians have characterised Bellingham's hasty trial and execution as contrary {{to the principles of}} justice. The possibility that he was acting within a conspiracy, on behalf of a consortium of Liverpool traders hostile to Perceval's economic policies, {{is the subject of a}} 2012 study.|$|E

Milne's form attracted attention elsewhere with Aberdeen among those interested, a move Milne favoured to be near his son and other family in Scotland. On being called into a meeting with manager, Joe Jordan, Milne was told by Jordan {{that he had no}} intention of letting him nor <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> other best players leave, but that he would make an exception for Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|After scoring four Test {{centuries and}} two ODI centuries in 2004, Trescothick was named {{as one of}} the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 2005. Between the two formats (Test and ODI), Trescothick has scored a century against every {{opponent}} he has played except Namibia and Netherlands, each of which he only faced in one ODI. Trescothick did not score a century in <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> three Twenty20 Internationals; his highest score was the 72 he scored against Sri Lanka in 2006.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Browning {{was awarded}} the Order of Polonia Restituta (II class) by the Polish government-in-exile, but his {{critical}} evaluation of the contribution of Polish forces led to the removal of Major-General Stanisław Sosabowski as commanding officer of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade. Some writers later claimed that Sosabowski had been made a scapegoat {{for the failure of}} Market Garden. Montgomery attached no blame to Browning or <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> subordinates, or indeed acknowledged failure at all. He told Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, that he would like Browning to take over VIII Corps in the event that Richard O'Connor, the GOC, were transferred to another theatre.|$|E

5|$|Al-Muwaffaq, {{suffering}} from gout, was already visibly nearing his end; the vizier Isma'il ibn Bulbul {{and the city}} commander of Baghdad, Abu'l-Saqr, called al-Mu'tamid and his sons, including the heir-apparent al-Mufawwad, into the city, hoping to exploit al-Muwaffaq's imminent death for their own purposes. Nevertheless the attempt to sideline Abu'l-Abbas failed due to his popularity with the soldiers and the common people. He was set free to visit his father's deathbed, {{and was able to}} immediately assume power when al-Muwaffaq died on 2 June. The Baghdad mob ransacked his opponents' houses, and Ibn Bulbul was dismissed and thrown in prison, where he died from maltreatment after a few months. Similar fates awaited <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> supporters that Abu'l-Abbas could lay his hands on.|$|E
5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences. However, {{he had little}} {{interest}} in sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos). He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so.|$|E
5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by court martial aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. The court acquitted him, his officers and his men of all blame. The court found the cause of the accident to be the thick fog and the ignorance of the pilots. The court required the pilots to forfeit their pay, barred them from piloting <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> Majesty's ships, and imprisoned them for a time in the Marshalsea.|$|E
