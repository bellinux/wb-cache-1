40|$|Network {{data access}} {{services}} such as OPeNDAP enable widespread access to data across user communities. However, without ready means to restrict access to data for such services, data providers and data owners are constrained from making their data more widely available. Even with such capability, the range of different security technologies available can make interoperability between services and user client tools a challenge. OPeNDAP is a key data access service in the infrastructure under development to support the CMIP 5 (Couple Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5). The work is being carried out {{as part of an}} international collaboration including the US Earth System Grid and Curator projects and the EU funded IS-ENES and Metafor projects. This infrastructure will bring together Petabytes of climate model data and associated metadata from over twenty modelling centres around the world in a federation with a core archive mirrored at three data centres. A security system is needed to meet the requirements of organisations responsible for model data including the ability to restrict data access to registered users, keep them up to date with changes to data and services, audit access and protect ﬁnite computing resources. Individual organisations have existing tools and {{services such as}} OPeNDAP with which users in the climate research community are already familiar. The security system should overlay access control in a way which maintains the usability and ease of access to these services. The BADC (British Atmospheric Data Centre) has been working in collaboration with the Earth System Grid development team and partner organisations to develop the security architecture. OpenID and MyProxy were selected at an early stage in the ESG project to provide single sign-on capability across the federation of participating organisations. Building on the existing OPeNDAP speciﬁcation an architecture based on pluggable server side compo- nents has been developed at the BADC. These components ﬁlter requests to the service they protect and apply the required authentication and <b>authorisation</b> <b>schemes.</b> Filters have been developed for OpenID and SSL client based authentication. The latter enabling access with MyProxy issued credentials. By preserving a clear separation between the security and application functionality, multiple authentication technologies may be supported without the need for modiﬁcation to the underlying OPeNDAP application. The software has been developed in the Python programming language securing the Python based OPeN- DAP implementation, PyDAP. This utilises the Python WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) speciﬁcation to create distinct security ﬁlter components. Work is also currently underway to develop a parallel Java based ﬁlter implementation to secure the THREDDS Data Server. Whilst the ability to apply this ﬂexible approach to the server side security layer is important, the development of compatible client software is vital to the take up of these services across a wide user base. To date PyDAP and wget based clients have been tested and work is planned to integrate the required security interface into the netCDF API. This forms part of ongoing collaboration with the OPeNDAP user and development community to ensure interoperability. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{authorisation}} requirement aims {{to ensure a}} high level of protection by reducing emissions of SVHC from imported articles. Taking into account the overall purposes of REACH the restriction scheme also aims to ensure {{a high level of}} protection. However, with respect to reducing emissions of SVHC from imported articles, the comparison of both instruments shows that the <b>authorisation</b> <b>scheme</b> is clearly more effective since the respective requirement comes into effect more quickly, it shifts the burden of proof to the actors responsible for the possible risk and allows for case-by-case decisions to grant authorisation. The restriction in turn is not equally effective and, therefore, no preferable measure in terms of Article  2.2 TBT.

Following Art.  56 (1) REACH a manufacturer, importer or downstream user shall not place an Annex XIV substance on the market for use or use it himself, unless this use is exempt from the authorisation requirement or the actor, or his supplier, respectively, attained an authorisation for the corresponding use. The <b>authorisation</b> <b>scheme</b> thus establishes a use specific ban that is effective from a specified sunset date with permit reservation: by applying for authorisation actors may temporarily—according to Art. 60 (8) REACH every authorisation decision is subject to review—overcome the barrier of the ban.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} the REACH Regulation is to ensure {{a high level of}} {{protection}} of {{human health and the environment}} as well as the free circulation of substances on the internal market while enhancing competitiveness and innovation. To this end, REACH introduces, among other instruments, the authorisation regime for substances of very high concern (SVHC) that are listed on Annex XIV of the regulation. After expiration of the transitional period for each Annex XIV-SVHC, articles, such as most products of daily use, produced in the European Economic Area (EEA) may not contain such substances unless an authorisation was granted for the specific use or this use falls within the scope of an exemption from the authorisation requirement. The <b>authorisation</b> <b>scheme</b> does, however, only apply to SVHC used in the EEA. As a consequence, REACH does not regulate SVHC entering the European market as part of imported articles which burden human health and the environment. Moreover, from an economic perspective, domestic articles are subject to stricter requirements than those which are produced abroad, putting actors from within the EEA at competitive disadvantage and thus impeding the intention of REACH to enhance competitiveness and innovation. One option to close this regulatory gap could be to extend the authorisation requirement to SVHC present in imported articles. A legal appraisal on behalf of the German Environment Agency (UBA) assesses whether such option would be in accordance with the specifications of WTO world trade law. It concludes that, measured by the standards of the WTO dispute settlement practice, such an extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>scheme</b> would neither violate the principles of national treatment and most-favoured nation treatment. Also, such regulation would not constitute an unnecessary obstacle to trade, since the extended authorisation requirement would pursue a legitimate objective covered by the regulatory autonomy of the EU and, furthermore, the regulation would not be more trade-restrictive than necessary. The contribution at hand summarises the main findings while taking into account first reactions to the legal appraisal.|$|R

30|$|The {{technical}} regulation {{of an extended}} <b>authorisation</b> <b>scheme</b> aims to prevent the risks posed by SVHC in imported articles. For all SVHC ‘scientific evidence of probable serious effects to human health or the environment’ 6 is available and every authorisation process includes, among other aspects such as socio-economic considerations, a comprehensive risk assessment. The {{technical regulation}} restricts international trade by imposing an authorisation requirement for SVHC listed in Annex XIV REACH and {{that are used in}} imported articles. However, article producers may lift the ban by proving that the risks posed by the substance use are adequately controlled or that the socio-economic benefits outweigh the risks. This instrumental design attenuates the measure’s intrusiveness. Moreover, the technical regulation is likely to make a significant contribution to its purposes while these purposes are legitimate objectives under Article 2.2 TBT. As no equally effective alternative means are available, the overall view of these facts leads {{to the conclusion that the}} extended authorisation requirement is not more trade-restrictive than necessary in terms of Article  2.2 TBT.|$|R
30|$|Pursuant to Art. 2.2 TBT, ‘technical {{regulations}} {{shall not}} be more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective, taking account of the risks non-fulfilment would create.’ Such risks of not fulfilling the legitimate objective might thus give hints as to {{the necessity of a}} technical regulation. Sentence  4 of Art.  2.2 TBT continues that ‘[i]n assessing such risks, relevant elements of consideration are, inter alia: available scientific and technical information […] or intended end-uses of products’. To determine the risks in case the <b>authorisation</b> <b>scheme’s</b> goals are not fulfilled, the ‘nature of the risks’ to {{human health and the environment}} caused by SVHC have to be examined [21]. Taking into account available scientific and technical information as well as intended end-uses of products, this analysis includes both procedural and substantive considerations as explained in the next two sections. From a procedural point of view an assessment is necessary whether the risk assessment provided for in the extended authorisation requirement is appropriate to determine risks in terms of Art.  2.2 TBT. From a substantive point of view the significance which the TBT Agreement ascribes to these risks needs to be considered.|$|R
3000|$|Neither the TBT Agreement nor the {{relevant}} case law contain requirements concerning the risk assessment.

On this basis the conclusion can be drawn that the risk assessment in accordance with the extended authorisation requirement conforms to the requirements of the SPS Agreement. By implementation of quantitative and qualitative risk characterisation methods in the application for authorisation (Art.  62 (4)(d) REACH in conjunction with Art.  14 and Annex I REACH) and its review by ECHA’s committee for risk assessment (Art. 64 (4) REACH), the <b>authorisation</b> <b>scheme</b> ensures the assessment of the risks in each application of SVHC in an article.

Because extranets allow third-party users into corporate networks, they need to be extremely secure and external access needs to be highly controllable. Access control and authorisation mechanisms must be in place to regulate user access to information/resources {{in a manner that is}} consistent with the current set of policies and practices both at intra-organisational and cross-organisational levels.

30|$|Besides, {{it has to}} {{be checked}} whether the scheme {{constitutes}} a de facto discrimination against foreign products. In this respect, all detrimental impacts on the competitive opportunities of imported products caused by the regulation at hand might potentially be relevant for the examination [21]. However, even if detrimental effects exist, this impairment could be due to a legitimate regulatory distinction and for this reason be altogether justified [18, 20]. This is also the case with respect to the extended authorisation requirement. For instance, under REACH, a company needs to be established within the community to place substances, mixtures or articles on the market. The same requirement would apply to obtaining the authorisation for use of certain SVHC in an imported article. Companies without establishment in the community would thus need an importer or an only representative according to Art.  8 REACH with establishment in the community to apply for authorisation, affecting the compliance costs of the company. At the same time, companies are not forced to contract one of the mentioned actors, unless they refuse establishment of an office in the community. It could be argued that the competitive opportunities of foreign companies without establishment in the community are detrimentally impacted [22]. However, the legislator’s intention to require establishment in the community needs to be appreciated. Generally, legal acts issued by an administrative body may not be served to actors from outside EU; the same applies for favourable legal acts. Moreover, the objectives of the <b>authorisation</b> <b>scheme</b> can only be achieved if the provisions are linked with appropriate and effective enforcement mechanisms. To this end, the European intermediary is a prerequisite that the REACH requirements can be fully applied or, where appropriate, enforcing measures (e.g. criminal sanctions) can be taken. Hence, the putative impairment of competitive opportunities of imported products would be justified by legitimate regulatory distinctions in terms of Art. 2.1 TBT. As a result, the extended authorisation requirement would not cause a de facto discrimination.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MA (Political Science)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Private Military and Security Companies (PMSCs) {{have become}} {{increasingly}} important actors {{since the end of}} the Cold War. They provide a wide range of services and are therefore difficult to classify. Many view them as new front companies for mercenaries, which this thesis argues is not the case. Few states have put in place legislation to deal with the problems caused by these companies, and they are therefore generally not accountable to states. This is problematic because their services are within an area where states have traditionally had monopoly. This thesis studies the new South African legislation, the Prohibition of Mercenary Activities and Regulation of Certain Activities in Country of Armed Conflict Act of 2006, which was put in place in order to ban mercenaries and regulate the services offered by the private military and security companies based in the country. By comparing it to the older South African legislation, the thesis evaluates the extent to which the new legislation has been able to close loopholes inherent in the old legislation. The new South African legislation is also compared to the international conventions which bans mercenaries. By banning these actors, South Africa is very much in line with the international community when it designed the conventions. However, PNSCs are not mercenaries. The thesis then compares the new South African legislation to the domestic regulation in place in the United States of America. It finds that despite having many of the same weaknesses as the South African legislation, it is more likely that the American regulation will be abided by than the South African. This is due to the positive relationship between the US government and American PMSCs, and the fact that the government is a major client of the companies. South Africa does not enjoy the same positive relationship with its companies. Finally, the new South African legislation is compared to the UK Green Paper of 2002, which presented options of how to deal with the companies. The ban on mercenaries put in place by the new South African legislation was discouraged in the Green Paper. The licensing regime (as in the USA) that was proposed by the Green Paper, however, is similar to the <b>authorisation</b> <b>scheme</b> established in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} access to the radio {{spectrum}} is setting the stage for a revision of existing radio spectrum management practices, mainly oriented towards exclusive use of frequency bands. A new wave of policy reforms is envisaged, with a potential shift of policy focus from static to dynamic efficiency. A previous wave of policy reforms promoted the implementation of market mechanisms for a more efficient distribution and use of radio frequencies, i. e. static efficiency. This second wave of spectrum policy reforms might translate into a new generation of spectrum management more centred on spectrum sharing solutions. Spectrum sharing could ensure more flexibility in spectrum use and certainty of radio spectrum access thanks to technology advances, thus promoting investment and innovation, i. e. dynamic efficiency. Among several forms of spectrum sharing solutions, collectively referred to as Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) systems, the concept of Licensed Shared Access (LSA) has recently been under scrutiny, in particular in the European Union (EU) and in the United States (US). LSA is an <b>authorisation</b> <b>scheme</b> that allows for shared use of already assigned but underused spectrum bands between incumbent(s) and new user(s) by means of exclusive individual spectrum rights of use. The adoption of the LSA regime would contribute to spectrum efficiency by making underused spectrum bands available for new users. The use of Reconfigurable Radio System (RRS) technologies, such as Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Cognitive Radio (CR) would minimise the risk of harmful interference. Against this background, this paper is intended as a progress report on the discussion upon the LSA regime, based on an extensive bibliography, which includes official documents, academic papers, position papers and reports. Several studies agree on the contribution LSA could bring in terms of spectrum efficiency. In this regard, selected elements of the LSA regime are assessed in terms of potential contribution to dynamic efficiency, taking into consideration the dichotomy between static and dynamic efficiency. These elements are: contract length; sharing arrangements; assignment procedure for LSA licences; implementation of RRS technologies; monitoring and enforcement. Although priority has historically been given to exclusive assignment of radio spectrum rights of use, the authors recognise the potential of LSA as a complementary regime that could promote spectrum efficiency. However, the authors advocate further exploration to clarify whether and to what extent LSA would be beneficial in terms of dynamic efficiency, i. e. promotion of investment and innovation and, thus, economic growth, taking into consideration the potential trade-off between static and dynamic efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Workflows {{are often}} used to {{represent}} enterprise-type activities, and authorisation control is an important security consideration in enterprise-level applications. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a popular <b>authorisation</b> control <b>scheme</b> under which users are assigned to certain roles, and the roles are associated with permissions. This paper presents a novel mechanism for modelling workflow execution in cluster-based resource pools under Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) schemes. Our modelling approach uses Coloured Timed Petri-Nets, and various authorisation constraints are modelled, including role constraints, temporal constraints, cardinality constraints, Binding of Duty and Separation of Duty constraints, etc. The interactions between workflow authorisation and workflow execution are also captured in the model. In this paper, the modelling mechanism is developed in such a fashion that {{the construction of the}} authorisation model for a workflow can be automated. This feature is very helpful in modelling a large collection of authorisation policies or complex workflows. A Petri-net simulation tool, the CPN-Tool, is utilised to implement the developed modelling mechanism and simulate the constructed model. Both system-level performance (e. g., utilisation of resource pools) and application-level performance (e. g., workflow response time) can be obtained from model simulations. This work can be used to plan system capacity and investigate the impact of authorization policies on system and application performance...|$|R

40|$|Automating the {{execution}} of workflows (or business processes) on computer resources {{has been the subject}} of much research. However, many workflow scenarios still require human involvement, which introduces additional authorization concerns. Role-Based Authorization Control (RBAC), under which the users are assigned to certain roles while the roles are associated with prescribed permissions, is a popular <b>authorisation</b> control <b>scheme.</b> When we allocate resources for workloads and plan system capacities, it is often assumed that when a task is allocated to a resource, the resource will accept the task and start {{the execution}} once the processor becomes available. However, the authorization policies impose further constraints on task executions, and therefore may incur performance penalty and affect both application- and system-oriented performance. This paper investigates the issue of allocating resources for running workflows under the role-based authorization control. The resource allocation strategies are developed in this paper for both human resources and computing resources. The allocation strategy for human resources takes into account the authorization constraints and establishes the optimization equation subject to the constraint of the budget available to hire human resources. Then the optimization equation is solved to obtain the number of human resources allocated to each authorization role. The allocation strategy for computing resources also takes into account authorization constraints, calculating not only the number of computing resources, but also the proportion of processing capacity in each resource allocated to serve the tasks assuming each role. The simulation experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the developed allocation strategies. The experimental results show that the allocation strategy developed in this paper outperforms the traditional allocation strategies, which do not consider authorization constraints, in terms of- both average response time and resource utilization...|$|R
5|$|In 1872 Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was {{appointed}} as the Metropolitan Railway's Chairman. A director of many railway companies, {{he had a}} vision of unifying a string of railway companies to create a single route running from Manchester via London to an intended Channel Tunnel and on to France. In 1873 Watkin entered negotiations {{to take control of the}} Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and a section of the former Buckinghamshire Railway running north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He planned to extend the MR north from London to Aylesbury to join the existing lines and create a direct route from London to the north of England. He also proposed to extend a short rail branch which ran from the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway to the small town of Brill, known as the Brill Tramway, southwest to Oxford, and thus create a through route from London to Oxford. Rail services between Oxford and London at this time were poor, and although still an extremely roundabout route, had the scheme been completed it would have formed the shortest route from London to Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford upon Avon. The Duke of Buckingham, chairman of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and owner of the Brill Tramway, was enthusiastic, and <b>authorisation</b> for the <b>scheme</b> was sought from Parliament. Parliament did not share the enthusiasm of Watkin and the Duke, and in 1875 the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill was rejected.|$|R
