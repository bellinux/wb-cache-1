40|$|Our {{hypothesis}} {{was that the}} simultaneous activation of tongue protrudor and retractor muscles (co-activation) would constrict and stiffen the pharyngeal <b>airway</b> more than the independent activation of tongue protrudor muscles. Upper <b>airway</b> stiffness was determined by injecting known volumes of air into the sealed pharyngeal <b>airway</b> of the anaesthetized rat while measuring nasal pressure under control (no-stimulus) and stimulus conditions (volume paired with hypoglossal (XII) nerve stimulation). Stimulation of the whole XII nerves (co-activation) or the medial XII branches (protrudor activation) effected similar increases in total pharyngeal <b>airway</b> stiffness. Importantly, co-activation produced volume compression (<b>airway</b> narrowing) at large <b>airway</b> volumes (P < 0. 05), but {{had no effect on}} <b>airway</b> dimension at low <b>airway</b> volumes. In comparison, protrudor activation resulted in significant volume expansion (<b>airway</b> dilatation) at low <b>airway</b> volumes and <b>airway</b> narrowing at high <b>airway</b> volumes (P < 0. 05). In conclusion, both co-activation and independent protrudor muscle activation increase <b>airway</b> stiffness. However, their effects on <b>airway</b> size are complex and depend on the condition of the <b>airway</b> at the time of activation...|$|R

5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} breathe like mammals, with airflow {{moving in and}} out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more like birds, with airflow moving in a unidirectional loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, air flows through the trachea and into two primary bronchi, or <b>airways,</b> which branch off into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then into even narrower tertiary <b>airways,</b> and then into other secondary <b>airways</b> which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary <b>airways</b> and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the bronchial tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional airflow without the aid of avian-like air sacs.|$|E

40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease characterized by reversible airflow limitation and <b>airway</b> hyperresponsiveness.

40|$|Chapter 1 {{gives an}} {{introduction}} on {{the variation in}} <b>airway</b> obstruction {{in the general population}}. <b>Airway</b> caliber, which determines the extent of <b>airway</b> obstruction, varies at an endogenous, circadian rhythm.

There are different ways to investigate (variation in) <b>airway</b> obstruction in the general population. An individual's variation in <b>airway</b> obstruction or <b>airway</b> lability can be determined by measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability, measurement of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to methacholine, or measurement of reversibility of <b>airway</b> obstruction.

To evaluate the upper <b>airway</b> differences {{in patients with}} normal facial profile and those with skeletal class III deformity 3. To evaluate the differences in upper <b>airway</b> models among patients with different dentofacial deformities and describe the role of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in the human upper <b>airway</b> Materials and Methods Part I : Three-Dimensional Analysis of the Normative Upper <b>Airway</b> in Chinese This was a cross-sectional observational study. Cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT) scans of one hundred patients were analyzed. Computer analysis of the different upper <b>airway</b> parameters were studied including <b>airway</b> length and volume, as well as <b>airway</b> dimensions at the axial level of the soft palate, hard palate, base of tongue, and epiglottis. The most constricted <b>airway</b> location was identified and correlation analysis with variables of interest was done. Part II: A Cone Beam Computerized Tomography Study of <b>Airway</b> in Skeletal Class I and Class III Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) records of 200 patients were {{used to evaluate the}} upper <b>airway</b> dimensions. This sample consisted of patients with normal facial profile (Class I) and those demonstrating skeletal class III deformities. Computer analysis of the upper <b>airway</b> parameters such as <b>airway</b> length, <b>airway</b> volume, <b>airway</b> anterior-posterior and cross-sectional area dimensions at the hard palate, soft palate, base of tongue and epiglottis were performed. The most constricted <b>airway</b> sites were identified. Part III: Computational fluid dynamics study of upper <b>airway</b> in different dentofacial deformities Cone-beam computed tomography records of 12 patients were used to evaluate the upper <b>airway.</b> This sample consisted of facial skeletal Class I, II and III subjects. The upper <b>airway</b> models were constructed to allow CFD simulations in the <b>airway</b> from the epiglottis to the hard palate. Cross-sectional area, pressure, velocity and resistance were measured based on the reconstructed meshed models. Results Part I : Three-Dimensional Analysis of the Normative Upper <b>Airway</b> in Chinese In 100 subjects (40 males, 60 females) aged 16 - 40 years with normal facial profile, we found that the most constricted site occurs {{at the level of the}} soft palate. This surface area of this site was found to be linearly correlated to the <b>airway</b> volume, suggesting a significant relationship between the most constricted area and the total <b>airway</b> volume. Gender differences were found in <b>airway</b> length, volume, and in the dimensions at the base of tongue and epiglottis region. The mean <b>airway</b> length was 54. 12 mm + 6. 19 for males and 49. 25 mm + 4. 86 for females; <b>airway</b> volume of 15. 09 cm 3 + 4. 92 for males and 13. 12 cm 3 + 4. 72 for females. Part II: A Cone Beam Computerized Tomography Study of <b>Airway</b> in Skeletal Class I and Class III The sample consisted of 100 Class I (41 males, 59 females) with a mean age of 25. 4 years and 100 Class III (38 males, 62 females) with a mean age of 23. 5 years. Gender differences were noted in the <b>airway</b> length, <b>airway</b> volume and dimensions at the base of tongue and epiglottis for both groups. Males showed longer <b>airway</b> length, larger <b>airway</b> volume, larger <b>airway</b> dimensions at the base of tongue and epiglottis compared to females. Significant differences in all the <b>airway</b> parameters between the two groups were found except for <b>airway</b> length. The soft palate was found to be the most constricted <b>airway</b> site observed in the Class I subjects while Class III subjects showed restriction in both the soft palate and epiglottis region. Part III: Computational fluid dynamics study of upper <b>airway</b> in different dentofacial deformities The airflow was variable among <b>airway</b> in different skeletal deformities. The pressure changes along <b>airway</b> of Class II were the largest, followed by Class I. The pressure drop in the <b>airway</b> of Class III subjects were the smallest. The larger pressure differences would cause greater resistance in the <b>airway.</b> The highest resistance was observed in the <b>airway</b> of Class II subjects. Conclusion Part I : Three-Dimensional Analysis of the Normative Upper <b>Airway</b> in Chinese This <b>airway</b> data provide a normative reference that can be used in various dentofacial analysis as well as for diagnosis and treatment planning for related dentofacial deformities and in understanding the pathophysiology for sleep-related breathing disorders. Part II: A Cone Beam Computerized Tomography Study of <b>Airway</b> in Skeletal Class I and Class III The upper <b>airway</b> is larger in patients with Class III deformity than those with a normal facial profile. The site of restriction is commonly observed at the soft palate in the Class I group whereas patients with Class III deformity, the <b>airway</b> restriction sites are at both the soft palate and epiglottis. Understanding of the upper <b>airway</b> differences in between class I and class III facial deformities can have implications on treatment planning for orthognathic surgery.
