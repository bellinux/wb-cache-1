[...] UGO's Darren Latta noted as a downside to the series that [...] "the approach maybe a little too subdued at times." [...] Latta also felt that despite being familiar with the setting, Gaiman never utilized the period to its full potential.

500|$|Charles Cecil and Tony Warriner {{had worked}} {{together}} at Artic Computing, an English video game development company. In 1990, {{they decided that}} they would {{set up their own}} video game development company, together with David Sykes and Noirin Carmody. The four started up Revolution Software, initially based in Hull, with a 10 thousand pounds loan from Cecil's mother. Cecil wanted the game to differ from popular Sierra games at the time, saying: [...] "While I enjoyed Sierra games, I felt that there had to be more than yet again saving King Graham of Daventry from a – let’s be frank – fairly unlikely series of events. It was <b>all</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit twee. So we {{came up with the idea}} of writing an adventure game that did not take itself too seriously, but did have a serious story – something in-between Lucasarts and Sierra." [...] The game was published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment.|$|E
500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, [...] "I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more {{comfortable}} within ourselves, with this band....we're <b>all</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me– yielding, letting something else happen and going with it." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, {{and then you have to}} think, 'What are the real battles?' 'What's really important?' You get to a certain point, and it's really hard to remember what music is and to remember what drives you." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} of the book for The Daily Telegraph, British doctor and science writer James Le Fanu was critical, and commented that Taylor did not {{acknowledge}} [...] "the explanatory gap" [...] between current understanding of the brain's structure and [...] "what it does, how we think, feel and emote". Le Fanu concluded, [...] "The paradox of Brainwashing is {{that it would have been}} a much more interesting book if Dr Taylor had pursued the contrarian view of seeking to explain why that 'explanatory gap' is not merely unbridged but, with the advance of the neurosciences, now seems to be unbridgeable. A brain that was simple enough to be fully known would be too simple to contain conscious observers who might know it." [...] Nigel Hawkes of The Times criticized what he saw as Taylor's conclusion that [...] "we are <b>all</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit brainwashed by our culture and experience" [...] and noted that this assessment places Jim Jones of the Peoples Temple group in the same classification as the tabloid press.

[...] As such, the music in Hair runs the gamut of rock: from the rockabilly sensibilities of [...] "Don't Put it Down" [...] to the folk rock rhythms of [...] "Frank Mills" [...] and [...] "What a Piece of Work is Man". [...] "Easy to Be Hard" [...] is pure rhythm and blues, and protest rock anthems abound: [...] "Ain't Got No" [...] and [...] "The Flesh Failures". [...] The acid rock of [...] "Walking in Space" [...] and [...] "Aquarius" [...] are balanced by the mainstream pop of [...] "Good Morning Starshine". [...] Scott Miller ties the music of Hair to the hippies' political themes: [...] "The hippies... were determined to create art {{of the people and}} their chosen art form, rock/folk music was by its definition, populist. ...he hippies' music was often very angry, its anger directed at those who would prostitute the Constitution, who would sell America out, who would betray what America stood for; in other words, directed at their parents and the government."

[...] He also called Beyoncé [...] "fairly glorious" [...] and noted that [...] "the live versions of the '4' material are more invigorating than the studio equivalents, with Beyoncé's eight-piece all-female band making everything sound like the great cross-pollination of contemporary urban and '70s soul you'd hope for." [...] Praising Beyoncé's [...] "animal magnetism" [...] during the performances of the songs, Simon Gage of Daily Express said that [...] "Beyoncé shines when it comes to performing". Chuck Arnold of People magazine commented that the songs from 4 sound [...] "even better" [...] performed on the live album. Darryl Sterdan of the website Jam! said in his review, [...] "With her usual blend of divatastic majesty, girl-next-door intimacy and boundless energy, B... rewinds her career and performs her latest CD at a NYC ballroom." ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} on the website Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, [...] "Sweet Sacrifice" [...] is an alternative metal and gothic metal song, set in common time and performed in moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. It is written in the key of F# minor and Lee's vocals for the song range from the musical note of A#3 to G5. According to IGN's Ed Thompson, Lee sings the lines [...] "It's true we're <b>all</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> insane/But it's so clear now that I'm unchained", with her [...] "haunting vocals". Some critics found dark lyrics like [...] "I dream in darkness, I sleep to die, erase the silence, erase my life, our burning ashes darken the day, a world of nothingness, blow me away" [...] accompanied with [...] "rumbling guitars" [...] and a string section. A writer for the website Sputnikmusic found similarities between the songs on Fallen and [...] "Sweet Sacrifice". The main theme for the song is getting over from an abusive relationship. Jordan Reimer of The Daily Princetonian concluded that Lee sings the lines [...] "You know you live to break me" [...] and [...] "Are you still too weak to survive your mistakes?" [...] to Evanescence's past guitarist Ben Moody. That sentiment was echoed by Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone, {{who said that the}} lyrics [...] "One day I'm gonna forget your name/And one sweet day, you're gonna drown in my lost pain" [...] are aimed at Moody.|$|E

The music video leaked onto the Internet on April 4, 2007, after briefly being available for digital download on iTunes Store. It initially premiered on Yahoo! Music on April 5. The video was {{compared with the}} psychological thriller film directed by Tarsem Singh, The Cell (2000). Lee said that the main inspiration is [...] "like we're in the walls of our minds, sort of". During an interview with MTV News, she further revealed {{the concept of the}} video, [...] "It's mostly live performance. It's not so much fluff and flying and tricks and wolves and stuff. It's more really just about the song, and that is unique for us. We usually do crazy stuff. It's gonna be sort of like a video within the video. Since the song is our heaviest single, we really wanted to focus on mostly performance but still have something about it that's really unique. And I think [...] really {{hit the nail on the}} head." [...] The video starts with Lee laying on a couch and as the song progresses, she starts singing the lyrics [...] "It's true, we're <b>all</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> insane, but it's so clear now that I am unchained" [...] while getting up from it.

At San Diego Comic-Con International 2016, Marvel confirmed the castings of Keaton, Zendaya, Glover, Harrier, Revolori, Daly and Woodbine, while revealing Zendaya, Harrier, and Revolori's roles as Michelle, Liz Allan and Thompson, respectively, and announcing the casting of Jacob Batalon as Ned. It was also revealed that the Vulture would be the film's villain, while the writing teams of Watts and Christopher Ford, and Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, joined Goldstein and Daley in writing the screenplay, from Goldstein and Daley's story. Watts praised Goldstein and Daley's drafts as [...] "really fun and funny", and said that they [...] "sort of established the broad strokes of the movie", with he and Ford, close friends since childhood, then re-writing the script based on specific ideas that Watts had and things that he wanted to film, which he said was a [...] "pretty substantial structural pass, rearranging things and building it into the sort of story arc we wanted it to be." [...] McKenna and Sommers then joined the film to deal with changes to the script during filming, as [...] "it’s <b>all</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit flexible when you get to set.
