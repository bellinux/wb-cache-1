5|$|Every {{player has}} {{a limit to}} the number of units they can create—a {{population}} limit—but may not immediately use the entire potential population. The population capacity, which can be capped at anywhere between 75 – 200 in intervals of 25, is {{based on the number of}} houses, Castles, or Town Centers—the main building in a player's town—which have been built. The Age of Kings introduced two significant new features for unit management: the idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all a player's villagers into their Town Center, Castle, or tower for safety; units garrisoned within these three buildings, especially archers, increase the building's firepower (towers fire more arrows with units garrisoned inside) including the town center, which cannot fire <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> without someone garrisoned there.|$|E

25|$|Matrix mechanics, on {{the other}} hand, came from the Bohr school, which was {{concerned}} with discrete energy states and quantum jumps. Bohr's followers did not appreciate physical models which pictured electrons as waves, or as <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> They preferred {{to focus on the}} quantities which were directly connected to experiments.|$|E
25|$|Well, Jay, you {{absolutely}} are. I do apologize for any problems that {{my lack of}} sensitivity to perceptions has caused this movement. I do it happily and gladly to you and everyone else. I would never do <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> that hurt local United Ways, the mission or the people we serve.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of showing}} that the Boolean laws are satisfied, we can instead {{postulate}} a set X, two binary operations on X, and one unary operation, and require that those operations satisfy the laws of Boolean algebra. The elements of X need not be bit vectors or subsets but can be <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> This leads to the more general abstract definition.|$|E

5000|$|Negotiations on a {{successor}} to the Kyoto Protocol dominated the conference. A meeting of environment ministers and experts held in June called on the conference {{to agree on a}} road-map, timetable and 'concrete steps for the negotiations' with a view to reaching an agreement by 2009. It has been debated whether this global meeting on climate change has achieved <b>anything</b> significant <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{concept of}} pratītyasamutpāda {{has also been}} {{compared}} to the Western philosophy of metaphysics, {{the study of the}} nature of being and ultimate reality. Schilbrack states says that the doctrine of interdependent origination seems to fit the definition of a metaphysical teaching, by questioning whether there is <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Hoffman disagrees, and asserts that pratītyasamutpāda should not be considered a metaphysical doctrine in the strictest sense, since it does not confirm nor deny specific entities or realities.|$|E
25|$|A {{statue of}} George Orwell, sculpted by the British {{sculptor}} Martin Jennings, was unveiled on 7 November 2017 outside Broadcasting House, {{the headquarters of}} the BBC. The wall behind the statue is inscribed with: “If liberty means <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> it means the right to tell people what {{they do not want to}} hear”, words from his proposed preface to Animal Farm and a rallying cry for the idea of free speech in an open society.|$|E
25|$|Another {{difference}} is {{between those who}} believe the New Covenant has already substantially arrived (Preterists), and that this knowledge of God that the member of the New Covenant has is primarily salvific knowledge; and those that believe that the New Covenant has not yet substantially arrived, but will in the Second Coming, and that this knowledge is more complete knowledge, meaning {{a member of the}} New Covenant no longer has to be taught <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> regarding the Christian life (not just that they lack need for exhortation regarding salvific reconciliation with God).|$|E

5000|$|Compared {{to radical}} {{groups of the}} time, the Society was quite moderate. In fact, they were {{sometimes}} so scared {{to be associated with}} the radical movements of the time that they rarely said <b>anything</b> specific <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Instead of calling for drastic reform, they focused on listing grievances. As a result, their intentions seemed ambiguous. Francis himself stated that the Society delayed in making it clear what its intentions and feelings were about reform.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{his lifelong}} fame and upper-class origins, Churchill always {{struggled}} to keep his income at a level which would fund his extravagant lifestyle. MPs before 1946 received only a nominal salary (and in fact did not receive <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> until the Parliament Act 1911) so many had secondary professions from which to earn a living. From his first book in 1898 until his second stint as Prime Minister, Churchill's income while out of office was almost entirely made from writing books and opinion pieces for newspapers and magazines, among them the forthnightly columns {{that appeared in the}} Evening Standard from 1936 warning of the rise of Hitler and the danger of the policy of appeasement.|$|E
25|$|TSA rules {{state that}} if you move your fire demon next to an {{opposing}} fire demon, only your fire demon is immolated; all other adjacent pieces survive. This implies that a fire demon's passive burn (how it automatically burns enemy pieces that end up next to it without moving) is faster than its active burn (how it burns enemy pieces that it moves next to). A few computer programs and books stipulate that other adjacent pieces are immolated as well, with only the opposing fire demon surviving, but this interpretation is not widely followed. Both variants are playable, though the TSA rules are more consistent in not allowing the suicidal fire demon to burn <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{bomb that}} Çatlı's team had planted in Ara Toranyan's car on 22 March 1983 did not explode. A {{follow-up}} attempt also failed. Toranyan {{said they had}} planted the bomb in the wrong car. Likewise, Henri Papazyan's car bomb on 1 May 1984 did not explode. Çatlı claimed credit for killing Hagop Hagopian, however {{he was in a}} French prison (again, on narcotics charges) {{at the time of the}} attack. Papazyan is now believed to have been killed as a result of infighting. The second French team (led by Ketene) did carry out some attacks (which Çatlı also claimed credit for), such as the 1984 Alfortville monument and Salle Pleyel concert room attacks. It is unknown whether the Lebanese contingent did <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E

60|$|This person--so Nicholas {{observed}} in the same glance at the mirror which had enabled him to see his face--was standing {{with his back to}} the fire conversing with a younger man, who stood {{with his back to the}} company, wore his hat, and was adjusting his shirt-collar by the aid of the glass. They spoke in whispers, now and then bursting into a loud laugh, but Nicholas could catch no repetition of the words, nor <b>anything</b> sounding <b>at</b> <b>all</b> like the words, which had attracted his attention.|$|R
25|$|As a brief example, Frame {{uses the}} {{epistemology}} of Kant, who taught that {{the categories of}} thought that are necessary for our understanding the world around us, such as causality, logic, time, space, and order, are structured by our minds and imposed upon the things we experience. In order to be rational and {{make sense out of}} life we must assume, or presuppose, these notions. Because we cannot empirically verify these categories by touch, smell, sight, etc. they must be thought of as created by and arising from our minds, thus ordering and providing the criterion for those things that we can empirically verify. This led Kant to conclude that if we are to think of <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> we must think in terms of everything being caused by something logically and temporally prior to it. This led to a fairly deterministic view of mankind.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Wilson {{remembers how}} {{he got a job}} at the local {{airfield}} thanks to Frank's dad. Frank quickly became a pilot, but Wilson didn't have the money to get flight certified and as such became a mechanic and fixed planes. Regardless he was still happy in life and eventually asked Amelia to marry him, and she agreed. That evening Amelia told Lawrence, who strangely didn't say <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> and left to do some work in the field. When Frank found out about the wedding, he privately told Wilson to cancel it saying that Amelia would never settle for a quiet life in Bastion Falls. Wilson ignored his request, confident he would soon have his pilots license and would be able to fly her to the Big City. Suddenly the bell from the hilltop church begins to ring in the Dreamscape, and Wilson heads over there. Once he does he remembers how on the wedding day Amelia never showed up, and she was never seen again. Lawrence blamed her disappearance on Wilson, saying that this would never have happened if he hadn't asked her to marry him.|$|E
25|$|This {{meant that}} taxes, {{infrastructure}} improvement, and internal trade policy were defined independently by each territory, leading to many internal customs barriers and tolls, and conflicting policies {{even within the}} Habsburg domains. Charles I and Philip II {{had been able to}} master the various courts through their impressive political energy, but the much weaker Philip III and IV allowed it to decay, and Charles II was incapable of controlling <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> The development of Spain itself was hampered by the fact that Charles I and Philip II spent most of their time abroad; for most of the 16th century, Spain was administrated from Brussels and Antwerp, and it was only during the Dutch Revolt that Philip returned to Spain, where {{he spent most of his}} time in the seclusion of the monastic palace of El Escorial. The empire, held together by a determined king keeping the bureaucracy together, experienced a setback when a less-trusting ruler came to the throne. Philip II distrusted the nobility and discouraged any independent initiative among them. While writers of the time offered novel solutions to Spain's problems such as using irrigation in agriculture and encouragement of economic activity, the nobility never really produced anyone that could bring about serious reforms.|$|E

40|$|My aim here is {{to answer}} the {{question}} about why is there somethingrather than nothing by arguing for the existence of some necessary beings (that, assuch, couldn’t not exist) – the space, the time, and the natural basic laws – and byshowing that the existence of nothingness is logically impossible. I also try toaccount for the fact that contingent beings arise from necessary beings bydistinguishing between necessary existence and necessary arising, as to answer thequestion about why is there <b>anything</b> contingent <b>at</b> <b>all</b> and to propose a solution tothe Dilemma of Contingency...|$|R
25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E
500|$|However, Downing Street's {{spokesman}} strongly {{denied the}} suggestion that Alexander was trying to distance Britain from US foreign policy and show that Britain would not necessarily, in Tony Blair's words, stand [...] "shoulder to shoulder" [...] with George W.

To interpret this as saying <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> about our relationship with the U.S. is nonsense." ...|$|E
500|$|Oppy {{criticized the}} argument, viewing it as a weak {{parody of the}} ontological argument. He stated that, {{although}} it may be accepted {{that it would be a}} greater achievement for a non-existent creator to create something than a creator who exists, there is no reason to assume that a non-existent creator would be a greater being. He continued by arguing that there is no reason to view the creation of the world as [...] "the most marvellous achievement imaginable". Finally, he stated that it may be inconceivable for a non-existent being to create <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
50|$|This book {{takes up}} the {{philosophical}} questions: What is time? who am I? What is real? Why does <b>anything</b> exist <b>at</b> <b>all?</b> and presents them for the adult reader while guiding the reader through the history of philosophy. The book was published by Lindhart og Ringhof in 1992. Shortly thereafter Moskvitin wrote a highly critical and devastating review of his book in the Danish newspaper Politiken under a pen name. The aim was to create debate and interest in the book, but Moskvitin's plan backfired {{and the result was}} a low sale.|$|R

"In {{the case}} of [...] "attentat sans violence" [...] without violence, the offence in which the police {{have been unable to}} find <b>anything,</b> nothing <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> in that case, the {{criminal}} is simply a criminal because he is a criminal, because he has those tastes. It is {{what used to be called}} a crime of opinion. (...)

5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{questions}} that can be asked in this setting is {{about the relationship between}} the significant performance and its reflective critique. If one expresses oneself in a particular fashion, and someone says [...] "that's true", is there <b>anything</b> useful <b>at</b> <b>all</b> that can be said in general terms about the relationship between these two acts? For instance, does the critique add value to the expression criticized, does it say something significant in its own right, or is it just an insubstantial echo of the original sign? ...|$|R
