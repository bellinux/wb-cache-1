25|$|As befits {{a logical}} language, {{there is a}} large {{assortment}} of logical connectives. Such conjunction words take different forms depending on what they connect, <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the (standard) Lojbanic expressions are typically precise and clear.|$|E
25|$|These {{barriers}} are <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> NP-complete problems are useful: if a polynomial-time algorithm {{can be demonstrated}} for an NP-complete problem, this would solve the P = NP problem in a way not excluded by the above results.|$|E
50|$|Pakistan's {{automotive}} sector has not experienced significant {{growth and the}} small car segment remains totally monopolized by PakSuzuki. Due {{to the lack of}} competition in the country, Paksuzuki is selling obsolete vehicles without any safety features or upgrades in Pakistan. Government policies have consistently favored Paksuzuki, Toyota, and Honda due to which further investment has been blocked in the country. Used car imports are also <b>another</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> new assemblers are unwilling to invest. When Nexus Automotive was operating Gandhara Nissan (Nissan), Deewan Mushtaq (Hyundai and Kia), and Adam Motors had assembling operations in Pakistan; however, now all three have stopped assembly of passenger vehicles in the country.|$|R

25|$|Easy {{access to}} fresh water {{also would have}} been mandatory, which is <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> {{settlements}} were in bottom lands near water. A number of wells from the times have been discovered, with a log-cabin type lining constructed one layer at a time as the previous layers sank into the well.|$|E
25|$|Brad and Adam {{may have}} been {{from as far away}} as Canada, which is <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> they remain unidentified.

25|$|Copper’s higher tensile {{strength}} (200–250 N/mm2 annealed) compared to aluminium (100 N/mm2 for typical conductor alloys) is <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> copper is used {{extensively in the}} building industry. Copper’s high strength resists stretching, neck-down, creep, nicks and breaks, and thereby also prevents failures and service interruptions. Copper is much heavier than aluminum for conductors of equal current carrying capacity, so the high {{tensile strength}} is offset by its increased weight.|$|E

50|$|<b>Another</b> main <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the NCR has {{the highest}} income because more than 50% of its income is {{generated}} from local taxation and {{other sources of revenue}} while the rest comes from the Internal Revenue Grant. Also, the NCR allocates 12-13% of its income to education, and has a high amount of savings, thus ensuring its independence from the National Government. However, the NCR is the highest borrower among all the regions, thus it also {{has the highest}} debt at the same time.|$|R
60|$|And {{this brings}} me to <b>another</b> {{principal}} <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> a tradesman should not only keep books, but be very regular and exact in keeping them in order, that is to say, duly posted, and all his affairs exactly and duly entered in his books; and this is, that if he should be surprised by sudden or unexpected sickness, or death, as many are, and as all may be, his accounts may not be left intricate and unsettled, and his affairs thereby be perplexed.|$|R
25|$|There was <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> another synagogue was needed. The Jewish {{community}} in Singapore was now {{made up of}} Jews from Europe {{as well as from}} Asia. Different backgrounds in the community led to disagreements over the order of service and specific rituals. Manasseh Meyer, who established the Maghain Aboth Synagogue, was very sensitive to this friction and was finally prompted to build his own private synagogue near his home in Oxley Rise.|$|E
25|$|There is <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> Ellis’ {{paintings}} are {{not strong enough}} to be called the scientific illustration. It seems that Ellis had her own taste when she choosing the object, which resulted in the limitation of botanical species in her painting. She preferred colorful and showy species rather than many small-flowered herbaceous species, for example, waterlilies were her most favorite flowers, and there was no depicting of the large and significant sunflower family in her artworks.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, Bartow's {{growth was}} modest, {{especially}} {{in comparison to the}} rest of the county and state. While other cities in Polk County aggressively annexed adjacent land and allowed rapid growth, the government of Bartow generally took a more cautious approach. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> Bartow's growth had been slow was that most of the land surrounding the city was owned by phosphate mining companies making residential growth impractical. Although Bartow had been the largest city in Polk county in 1900, by the 1910 U.S. Census Lakeland had surpassed Bartow in population. Bartow remained the second largest city in the county until sometime in the 1950s when Winter Haven become more populous than Bartow.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Another</b> {{prominent}} <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> {{the album}} was not completed was because four of the members (Carl, Suggs, Lee and Chris) wished to use the tracks they had written for the next band they were forming. Nonetheless, the full six remaining members of the band did manage to record two tracks, [...] "(Waiting For) The Ghost Train" [...] and its B-Side [...] "Maybe In Another Life". These tracks became the group's farewell single. The Unreleased Madness Album was quickly substituted with a rush-released second compilation album titled Utter Madness.|$|R
50|$|When beauty {{advertisements}} make {{promises that}} certain product can make consumers look younger. Beauty advertising often {{has little to}} do with the product. The product is often dwarfed by a beautiful woman’s image. As beauty advertisement is selling the beauty and also the self-worth. This is also <b>another</b> important <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> celebrities are increasingly appeared on beauty products advertisements. Celebrities represent the best selves, they are beautiful and adored by millions. After consumer review those beauty product campaigns, they will start to concern about their appearance and start to shop before they get ugly.|$|R
25|$|Since E. imperialis is a euglossine species, {{they are}} a non-social bee, and {{therefore}} lack the formation of colonies. Studies have shown that significant barriers to establish stable perennial colonies arise from two main factors: high diploid male production and genetic polymorphism. There could be no supply of truly altruistic workers (or drones), since the supply would be inconsistent, with up to 50% of the intended diploid females actually being males. Therefore, with no drone class, colonies {{would not be able}} to adequately form. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> there is such a high diploid male population is because diploid male larva live within thick, closed off resinous cells which are not readily eliminated by the females. Diploid males are therefore seen as a ‘waste’ in energy and resources, and have no adaptive value to other bees.|$|E
25|$|Islamic art {{frequently}} adopts {{the use of}} geometrical floral or vegetal {{designs in}} a repetition known as arabesque. Such designs are highly nonrepresentational, as Islam forbids representational depictions as found in pre-Islamic pagan religions. Despite this, there is a presence of depictional art in some Muslim societies, notably the miniature style made famous in Persia and under the Ottoman Empire which featured paintings of people and animals, and also depictions of Quranic stories and Islamic traditional narratives. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> Islamic art is usually abstract is to symbolize the transcendence, indivisible and infinite nature of God, an objective achieved by arabesque. Islamic calligraphy is an omnipresent decoration in Islamic art, and is usually expressed {{in the form of}} Quranic verses. Two of the main scripts involved are the symbolic kufic and naskh scripts, which can be found adorning the walls and domes of mosques, the sides of minbars, and so on.|$|E
25|$|The first Indian {{immigrants}} in British Columbia allegedly faced widespread racism {{from the local}} white Canadians. Race riots targeted these immigrants, {{as well as new}} Chinese immigrants. Most decided to return to India, while a few stayed behind. The Canadian government prevented these men from bringing their wives and children until 1919, <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> many of them chose to leave. Quotas were established to prevent many Indians from moving to Canada in the early 20th century. These quotas allowed fewer than 100 people from India a year until 1957, when the number was increased to 300. In 1967, all quotas were scrapped. Immigration was then based on a point system, thus allowing many more Indians to enter. Since this open-door policy was adopted, Indians continue to come in large numbers, and roughly 25,000-30,000 arrive each year, which now makes Indians the second highest group immigrating to Canada each year, after the Chinese.|$|E
5000|$|WMHE's initial format {{consisted}} of [...] "fine arts" [...] music programming, including classical, jazz, and big band music. But, <b>another</b> important <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> Mr. Hillebrand created WMHE was to transmit the new Muzak subscription service to businesses and {{restaurants in the}} Toledo area. FM radio has a second audio channel, a subcarrier channel, that’s only received through special receivers and used to distribute Muzak. The transmitter was located behind the studio building on Bancroft St. next to an electronics store also {{owned and operated by}} Mr. Hillebrand (Hillebrand Electronics).|$|R
30|$|Although quantum {{efficiency}} (QE) is not high, ~ 4  % at 2  μm, the uniformity {{and stability of}} PtSi SB are superb owing to its monolithic structure (Akiyama et al. 1994). For applications in which shot noise of incoming photon dominates (e.g., Venus observations), the advantage of PtSi overcomes the disadvantage of low QE. Domestic availability of large format arrays was <b>another</b> major <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the PtSi SB was chosen for IR 2. The IR 2 -SNS (a 1 -Mpixels PtSi SB detector), manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric, Corp. (MELCO), has all design details disclosed to us.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{possible}} <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> Mozart didn't stay {{is given}} by Volkmar Braunbehrens, citing Schenk: the death in Vienna in November 1787 of Gluck, whose post in the Imperial musical establishment Mozart sought (and ultimately got, though {{at a much lower}} salary); Mozart needed to return home to lobby for the position. Daniel E. Freeman has pointed out that the imperial appointment meant that Mozart would never live in any city other than Vienna. The prestige of such a position combined with the possibility of further employment and honors from the imperial court would have rendered any opportunities available in Prague unattractive in comparison.|$|R
25|$|Brown was a leg-spinner in his youth, {{but turned}} to medium paced bowling after the war. He {{was able to}} turn or cut the ball with his large hands and was a wicket taker rather than a {{container}} of batsmen, but sometimes lost his line and length. As a pace bowler he was more accurate, was able to tie down even the best batsmen and proved adept at breaking solid partnerships. In particular {{he was able to}} dismiss the stonewalling Australian captain Lindsay Hassett. He still used his leg-spin when required by conditions or the frailties of the batsmen, sometimes mixing them up in the same over. His bucket hands made him a good catcher and he once caught and bowled Keith Miller in both innings of a Test, so the Australian all-rounder nicknamed him 'C and B'. As a batsman he stuck to the simple expedient of blocking the good balls and thumping the bad ones. With his height, weight and strength he could strike the ball as hard as anyone and once hit a six into the Lord's Pavilion. His first-class centuries were noted for their plentiful boundaries and this was <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> his was popular with the crowds.|$|E
25|$|Using {{feedback}} about the original characters, Akihiko Yoshida was brought on as main character designer. While the team {{thought he would}} refuse due to his busy schedule, Yoshida was willing to join the project {{as a number of}} staff members at his company CyDesignation were fans of Nier. Yoshida joined a little later than usual in the process, so Taro gave him a general guideline of sleek designs with black as the dominant color. As opposed to the original Nier, which was released in two versions with a different version of the main protagonist for western tastes, the team decided to have the game feature the same protagonist in all versions, focusing on creating a high-quality Japanese role-playing game rather than making adjustments for its western release. This wish for a uniform international appearance was <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the team brought in Yoshida. The Commander, Adam, and Eve were designed by Yuya Nagai. Square Enix artist Toshiyuki Itahana handled the redesigns for Devola and Popola. The enemy concept art was handled by Hisayoshi Kijima, while environmental artwork was done by Kazuma Koda, Yasuyuki Kaji, and Shohei Kameoka: environmental design was a collaborative effort with Yoko, and the team strove to make the environments appear like places players would visit in the real world. One of the challenges faced when creating the character models was making them seem alive despite their mechanical nature.|$|E
25|$|In {{particular}} {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s many gurus acquired groups of young followers in Western Europe and the USA. According to the American sociologist David G. Bromley this was partially {{due to the}} repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1965 which permitted Asian gurus entrance to the USA. According to the Dutch Indologist Albertina Nugteren, the repeal was only one of several factors and a minor one compared with the two most important causes for the surge of all things 'Eastern': the post-war cross-cultural mobility and the general dissatisfaction with established Western values. According to the professor in sociology Stephen A. Kent at the University of Alberta and Kranenborg (1974), {{one of the reasons why}} in the 1970s young people including hippies turned to gurus was because they found that drugs had opened for them the existence of the transcendental or because they wanted to get high without drugs. According to Kent, <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> this happened so often in the USA then, was because some anti-Vietnam War protesters and political activists became worn out or disillusioned of the possibilities to change society through political means, and as an alternative turned to religious means. Some gurus and the groups they lead attracted opposition. One example of such group was the Hare Krishna movement (ISKCON) founded by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, many of whose followers voluntarily accepted the demandingly ascetic lifestyle of bhakti yoga on a full-time basis, in stark contrast to much of the popular culture of the time.|$|E
40|$|Is there a {{link between}} public debt and wealth inequality? Could {{government}} bondholders use intra-generational redistribution strategically to make the repayment of debt politically viable? Using a two-generations game-theoretic model, we identify coordination and divide-and-conquer as key factors. By coordinating their bond investments, the old generation may secure a majority favoring debt repayment. As a consequence, coordination mediates the impact of wealth inequality on public debt. Furthermore, ease of coordination offers <b>another</b> compelling <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> declining population growth fosters the accumulation of public debt. We test our model in a laboratory experiment and confirm the central predictions...|$|R
500|$|In 1925, Gandhi gave <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> to <b>why</b> he got {{involved}} in the Khilafat movement and the Middle East affairs between Britain and the Ottoman Empire. Gandhi explained to his co-religionists (Hindu) that he sympathised and campaigned for the Islamic cause, not because he cared for the Sultan, but because [...] "I wanted to enlist the Mussalman's sympathy {{in the matter of}} cow protection". According to the historian M. Naeem Qureshi, like the then Indian Muslim leaders who had combined religion and politics, Gandhi too imported his religion into his political strategy during the Khilafat movement.|$|R
30|$|Previous {{research}} has found {{a strong correlation between}} size and a wide range of organizational practices, including horizontal and vertical differentiation, formalization, administrative intensity, internal labor markets, provision of training, etc. Among them, the most direct connection to size-earnings differential is internal labor market, which is used to describe structured employment relationships that include internal promotion along established job ladders and commitment to long-term employment. <b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> for <b>why</b> large employers pay more to workers of the same quality is that they are less able to judge accurately the productivity of their employees (so-called “monitoring costs”).|$|R

500|$|Critics reacted {{positively}} {{to the character}} of Dexter. Entertainment Weeklys Josh Wolk called him [...] "the hippest-looking killer since American Psychos Patrick Bateman". The San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman said [...] "What makes the series work so well is twofold. Hall is magnificent; it's another sterling performance from him. But instead of being pent up yet emotionally explosive, like his David Fisher on [...] "Six Feet Under," [...] he's cool and calculated and entirely without compassion as Dexter. That makes him alluring, in a strange way. while Ryan found him to be [...] "among the more compelling characters on the small screen". Gilbert described Dexter as a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, calling him a vigilante obsessive murderer with a slippery personality, but [...] "also a hero of sorts". InsidePulse.com reviewer Mathan Erhardt said that the episode did not quite meet his expectations and that [...] "to me the major flaw in the show is Dexter’s noir-esque narration", although he finished the review by saying [...] "Dexter, despite [...] flaws is yet <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> Sunday night {{is one of my favorite}} nights to watch TV." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{postcard}} of Carl and Ellie in Andy's room, {{an easter}} egg in the movie, puts it chronologically before Up. Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear shows a strong animosity towards humans after his owner Daisy replaced him. Moved by hatred, {{he starts to}} lead a toy population and believe that every toy will be sooner or later discarded by the humans who own them. This provides <b>another</b> <b>reason</b> for <b>why</b> human-made objects are motivated to take over. In this film, we briefly see that Buzz Lightyear's batteries are produced by the mega corporation Buy n Large (BnL), which shows great importance in later films.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>reason</b> for <b>why</b> {{many states}} have not adopted the FRCP {{is that they have}} borrowed, by {{occasional}} statutory acts, the most innovative parts of the FRCP for their civil procedure systems, while maintaining the general principle that the legislature should manage civil procedure. For example, the FRCP's liberal discovery rules heavily influenced the California Civil Discovery Act of 1957 as well as its replacement, the Civil Discovery Act of 1986. Thus, by fixing the most archaic and frustrating parts of their procedural systems, they have obviated the need for complete reform, which would also necessitate retraining all their lawyers and judges.|$|R
