500|$|Ray Davies {{has claimed}} that he was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Lola" [...] after Kinks manager Robert Wace spent a night in Paris dancing with a transgender woman. Davies said of the incident, [...] "In his apartment, Robert had been dancing with this black woman, and he said, 'I'm really onto a thing here.' And it was okay until we left at {{six in the morning}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Have you seen the stubble?' He said 'Yeah', but he was too pissed [...] to care, I think".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{retiring}} officially {{from the}} company, Marcus {{continued to be}} closely involved as an advisor even through the final weeks of his life. He established a sideline as a retailing consultant, maintaining regular business hours in his offices at Crescent Court {{for more than a}} decade and offering advice locally to luxury car dealership Sewell Corporation and hotelier Rosewood Corporation as well as internationally to such businessmen as Mohamed Al-Fayed of Harrods. Called on to consult for Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos, the 94-year-old businessman recalled arriving in his customary expensive tailored suit to discover 300 casually dressed employees: [...] "I took off my coat, my necktie and my shirt, down to my T-shirt. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Okay. Let’s talk.' I couldn’t have planned it better. It broke the ice. I was on stage for two hours." ...|$|E
500|$|Grande came up {{with the}} idea of the music video and {{contacted}} Max Landis, known for his 2012 film Chronicle. In an interview, Grande explained: [...] "It's very unique, it's very different, I called Max [...] up and I said 'hey I want to do something that ends exactly like this' and I described the ending shot to him <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I also want it to be (a) one take … and I want the ending shot to look like this, And I described those two things to him and he’s like, 'wow, that's ambitious and it’s brave and it’s different, but let's try it". A day later, Grande discussed the video's concept and said that it was [...] "the coolest concept ever and he killed it and it's very different. I'm very nervous about it because it's so unique and weird and I feel like brave and different, but it’s exciting".|$|E
6000|$|... "Hogs!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> so sarcastic, that Jone {{looked hard}} at me, but I didn't tell him {{anything}} more till we {{was in the}} boat, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> just <b>said</b> right out what had happened. Jone couldn't help laughing.|$|R
6000|$|I was dumfounded {{by such a}} proposition, {{and it is not}} {{impossible}} that my knees began to shake as I thought of attempting such a thing. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> suddenly remembered that we had no weapons aboard, except an old musket which we used to shoot into a flock of ducks now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> with a laugh: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May it please your Lordship," [...] he began; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> as <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> {{his mind}} became a ghastly blank, in which dim and formless ideas flitted vaguely to and fro.|$|R
60|$|I looked Alexander Abraham over gradually, {{in a way}} I have, {{beginning}} at his feet and traveling up to his head. I took my time over it; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> very quietly.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was only}} natural we should first congratulate {{each other on}} our good fortune in having come unwittingly to the very spot we most desired to gain, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> simply giving words to the {{thoughts}} which had entered my mind as I gazed upon the fortification: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did it, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to Bob, pointing: 'There's my house, and here's my office, and up there's Maine, and {{out that}} way is California, and over there is Florida--and that's your range 'til court meets. You're in my charge, and I take the responsibility. You be here when you're wanted.' ...|$|E
50|$|The rose is red, the violet's blue,The honey's sweet, {{and so are}} you.Thou art my {{love and}} I am thine;I drew thee to my Valentine:The lot was cast <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> drew,And Fortune <b>said</b> it shou'd be you.|$|R
6000|$|... "But it isn't anybody else, {{and that}} makes it impossible. Sometimes I think it might be if I would only say so to myself, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> all that <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to her about you comes up----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then he <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was mean, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was base, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> {{called him}} a beggar. If I had been cool, perhaps I shouldn't have {{called him a}} beggar. But I did, and I am {{ready to take the}} {{consequences}} of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{reflected}} again, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{more than}} anything to make her uncomfortable, I'm afraid: [...] "I feel perfectly easy in my conscience, personally, but I have a social duty in the matter, and I hope I shall perform it with more fidelity and courage than you have shown. I shall speak to Kendricks." ...|$|E
6000|$|I comforted {{him as well}} as I could. In {{such cases}} men do not need much expression. A grip of the hand, the {{tightening}} of an arm over the shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man's heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> softly to him, [...] "Come and look at her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had no {{courage to}} think that at first, heavenly kind as was your welcome to me. But soon I began to hope, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'I will haf her if I die for it,' and so I will!" [...] cried Mr. Bhaer, with a defiant nod, as if the walls of mist closing round them were {{barriers}} which he was to surmount or valiantly knock down.|$|E
60|$|He {{might as}} well have asked me my grandmother's opinion of protoplasm. <b>I</b> {{reflected}} respectfully, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> didn't know it had any particular shape. My gunpowdery chief went off with a bang, of course, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> went on loading and firing until he was out of adjectives.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Marmaduke did not speak, but he {{shut his}} lips tight, and his hand went to where the hilt of his sword would have been. Two of the constables went out and {{questioned}} the grooms, and found that you had, as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> ridden off. When they came back, there was some talk between the magistrates, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> four constables and some soldiers were left in the house. Sir Marmaduke's horse was brought round, and he rode away, with the magistrates and the other soldiers." ...|$|R
2500|$|I come {{to answer}} your question, [...] "If the consecration made by Pope John Paul II on 25 March 1984 in union with all the bishops of the world, {{accomplished}} the conditions for the consecration of Russia according to the request of Our Lady in Tui, Spain on 13 June 1929?" [...] Yes, it was accomplished, <b>and</b> since <b>then</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> that it was made.|$|R
60|$|Five minutes afterwards, George said, “Ah!” too, {{and threw}} his plate {{out on the}} bank; and, three minutes later than that, Montmorency gave {{the first sign of}} contentment he had {{exhibited}} since we had started, and rolled over on his side, and spread his legs out; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> “Ah!” and bent my head back, and bumped it against one of the hoops, but I did not mind it. I did not even swear.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told him}} I did. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I would run below for a minute, to ram {{a few of}} my things into a sailor's bag I had. I've never cared for a lot of dunnage; I {{believed}} in going about flying light when I was at sea. I came back and found him strolling up and down the deck, as if he were taking {{a breath of fresh air}} before turning in, like any other evening.|$|E
6000|$|VIVIE.--and to {{a concert}} where the band played all the evening: Beethoven and Wagner and so on. I wouldn't go through that {{experience}} again for anything you could offer me. I held out for civility's sake until the third day; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> plump out, that I couldn't stand any more of it, {{and went off to}} Chancery Lane. N o w you know the sort of perfectly splendid modern young lady I am. How do you think I shall get on with my mother? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{think he}} is so nice as an ape,' said Anne. 'He {{is more like a}} monkey. He tries the dolls by court-martial, and he shot Arabella with a pea-shooter, and broke her eye; only grandpapa made him have it put in again with his own money, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was a little sneak, and if I ever did it again he would shoot me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was a child}} {{going along}} out there {{and asked me if}} the postman had been by and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> yes, and she said how long since I saw him and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> hadn't seen him at all, and she <b>said</b> how did <b>I</b> know he'd been by, <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> because <b>I</b> smelt his track on the sidewalk, and she <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. What did she do that for?" ...|$|R
40|$|The main aim is an {{overview}} of process in a shape memory metal-based materials. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, I commented on the issue of history and principle of shape memory materials. In the second part I have divided this materials by a structural point of view, dealing with the most widely used memory material in practice. I pointed out its advantages and disadvantages. Another part was devoted to the production, thermal <b>and</b> mechanical processing. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> the most used application in practice. Finally, I commented on the future shape memory materials...|$|R
6000|$|I was on {{the point}} of {{interrupting}} Marlow when he stopped of himself, his eyes fixed on vacancy, or--perhaps--(I wouldn't be too hard on him) on a vision. He has the habit, or, say, the fault, of defective mantelpiece clocks, of suddenly stopping in the very fulness of the tick. If you have ever lived with a clock afflicted with that perversity, you know how vexing it is--such a stoppage. I was vexed with Marlow. He was smiling faintly while I waited. He even laughed a little. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> acidly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would you?" [...] Grizel asked merrily. [...] "Well, let me see. She {{was not at}} church--she {{never went}} there, you remember; but {{of course she was}} curious to hear about you, and I had no sooner got home than she came to me and said, 'Was he there?' 'Yes,' I said. 'Is he much changed?' she asked. 'He has a beard,' I said. 'You know that is not what I really mean,' she said, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'I don't think he is so much changed that it is {{impossible}} to recognize him again.'" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was delighted}} that I had guessed their {{relative}} qualities so perfectly, {{and when we}} arrived at Mrs. March I glibly presented them. My wife was all that I could have wished her to be of sympathetic and intelligent. She did not overdo it by shaking hands, but she made places for the ladies, smiling cordially; and Mrs. Deering made Miss Gage take the seat between them. Her husband and I stood awhile in front of them, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> we would go off and find chairs somewhere.|$|E
6000|$|... "I kenna," [...] {{answered}} the blind woman; [...] "I gat ill-will about it amang some o' our ain folk. They <b>said</b> <b>I</b> should hae been to him what Jael was to Sisera. But weel I wot I had nae divine command to shed blood, and {{to save it}} was baith like {{a woman and a}} Christian. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> they <b>said</b> <b>I</b> wanted natural affection, to relieve ane that belanged to the band that murdered my twa sons." ...|$|R
5000|$|I come {{to answer}} your question, [...] "If the consecration made by Pope John Paul II on 25 March 1984 in union with all the bishops of the world, {{accomplished}} the conditions for the consecration of Russia according to the request of Our Lady in Tui, Spain on 13 June 1929?" [...] Yes, it was accomplished, <b>and</b> since <b>then</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> that it was made.And I say that no other person responds for me, it is I who receive and open all letters and respond to them.|$|R
500|$|The vocals of {{the album}} were {{recorded}} at Sarm East to a click track using a Roland TR-808 drum machine, and other various machines and boxes synced up the tracks. As Langan recalls: [...] "In those days of relatively limited technology we again had to push {{what we had to}} the limit... If, for instance, something required an effect, whether it be tape delay or phasing or some big, delayed reverb, the art was to get that effect right and record it... It all had to be done <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> it would influence the next process." [...] Langan has noted that balancing the backing vocals in the songs from the album was a major problem, due to no available terabytes of storage. He stated: [...] "We'd make it as clean as we possibly could, bounce that down to two tracks <b>and</b> <b>then</b> we'd erase." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} so from the beginning," [...] she said. [...] "When I first knew Brisket, {{it was not for}} any love I had for the man, but because mother took him up. Mother promised him money; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I'd marry him,--not because I cared for him, but because he was respectable and all right. And then mother hadn't the money when the pinch came, and, of course, Brisket wasn't going to be put upon;--why should he? So I took up with Robinson, and you knew it, father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true," [...] I said to myself, with an inward laugh, [...] "I carry no glove or {{delicate}} handkerchief bound upon my visor--" [...] but at {{this point}} my mind wandered. I went more slowly, and at last I stopped and sat down under the shade of a way-side tree. I thought for a few minutes, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to myself, [...] "It seems to me {{this would be a good}} time to take one of those capsules," [...] and I took one. I then fancied that perhaps I ought to take two, but I contented myself with one.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was startled}} and surprised. It seemed so natural and simple {{to be talking}} under Mrs. Bouverie Barton's big {{chandelier}} with this interesting young man, and yet so impossible {{for a moment to}} connect him in thought with all the terrible things that one had read in books about the prisons and penal laws of China. That a graduate of London University, a philosopher learned in all the political wisdom of Ricardo, Mill, and Herbert Spencer, should really be subject to that barbaric code of abominable tortures, was more than one could positively realize. I hesitated a moment, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "But of course they will never recall you." ...|$|E
5000|$|We booked {{the studio}} for five days.... I {{went around to}} the record shop near the studio {{to get hold of}} Shaft.... and in the window was ... a big cut-out of Whitney Houston.... I love that track, and I loved Whitney Houston <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just <b>said</b> 'Wow', and bought the album Whitney.... We just played that track over and over again, and we just thought: ..."no point us making records when such fantastic records as this have been made". And that's how that track ... grew into a celebration of Whitney Houston. Bill Drummond ...|$|R
60|$|The {{doctor was}} the first friend I thought of; but I knew he was always out seeing his {{patients}} of an afternoon. The beadle was the next person who came into my head. He {{had the look of}} being a very dignified, unapproachable kind of man when he came about the inquest; but he talked to me a little <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was a good girl, and seemed, I really thought, to pity me. So to him I determined to apply in my great danger and distress.|$|R
5000|$|Huff {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan on a football scholarship in 1967. He played fullback for the freshman team in 1967, but switched to linebacker in his sophomore year. He recalled the transition from fullback to linebacker as follows:"As a freshman you were there to be meat. One day in practice I'm playing fullback and, when I {{go out for a}} pass, this little linebacker named Dennis Morgan who had forearms like Popeye just about ripped my head off. Right <b>then</b> <b>and</b> there <b>I</b> <b>said</b> 'I want to be that guy, not this guy.' I had no problem switching to linebacker." ...|$|R
