40|$|The role {{of exotic}} tree {{plantations}} for biodiversity conservation is contested. Such plantations nevertheless offer various ecosystem service benefits, which include carbon storage and facilitation of indigenous tree species regeneration. To assess forest restoration potential in tropical exotic tree plantations, we assessed native cloud forest tree regeneration in 166 plots in ca. 50 -year-old plantations of five timber {{species that are}} widely used in tropical plantations (Pinus patula, Eucalyptus saligna, Cupressus lusitanica, Grevillea robusta and Acacia mearnsii). Differences in species abundance, diversity and composition were compared among plantations, and between plantations and disturbed and undisturbed indigenous Afromontane cloud forest (southeast Kenya) relicts after controlling for environmental variation between plots (i. e. altitude, distance to indigenous forest, soil depth, slope, aspect) and for environmental and stand structural variation (i. e. dominant tree height and basal <b>area).</b> <b>Regenerating</b> trees were mostly early-successional species. Indigenous tree species regeneration was significantly higher in Grevillea plantations, where the seedling community also included late-successional tree species. Regeneration under Eucalyptus was particularly poor. Acacia had an strong invasive nature, reducing its potential role and usability in indigenous forest restoration. Our study underlined that exotic tree plantations have differential effects on native tree species regeneration, with high potential for Grevillea plantations and low potential for the invasive exotic species. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) {{images and}} vegetation typology, based on lichens {{as the principal}} component of caribou winter diet, was developed to map caribou habitat over a large and diversified area of Northern Qu&eacute;bec. This approach includes field validation by aerial surveys (helicopter), classification of vegetation types, image enhancement, visual interpretation and computer assisted mapping. Measurements from more than 1500 field sites collected over six field campaigns from 1989 to 1996 represented the data analysed in this study. As the study progressed, 14 vegetation classes were defined and retained for analyses. Vegetation classes denoting important caribou habitat included six classes of upland lichen communities (Lichen, Lichen-Shrub, Shrub-Lichen, Lichen-Graminoid-Shrub, Lichen-Woodland, Lichen-Shrub-Woodland). Two classes (Burnt-over <b>area,</b> <b>Regenerating</b> burnt-over area) are related to forest fire, and as they develop towards lichen communities, will become important for caribou. The last six classes are retained to depict remaining vegetation cover types. A total of 37 Landsat TM scenes were geocoded and enhanced using two methods: the Taylor method and the false colour composite method (bands combination and stretching). Visual inter&not;pretation {{was chosen as the}} most efficient and reliable method to map vegetation types related to caribou habitat. The 43 maps produced at the scale of 1 : 250 000 and the synthesis map (1 : 2 000 000) provide a regional perspective of caribou habitat over 1200 000 km 2 covering the entire range of the George river herd. The numerical nature of the data allows rapid spatial analysis and map updating...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to identify the influence of canopy cover on butterfly abundance in young secondary forest and regenerating forest at Maragamuwa area of Kumaragala forest reserve in Naula, Matale district of Sri Lanka. Line transect method was used to collect data. Hundred meter long five transects were established in each forest area. Butterfly abundance data were collected weekly for eight months from January to August 2014. Regenerating forest had low canopy cover (< 50 %) than young secondary forest (20 - 90 %). Total of 2, 696 butterflies belonging to 87 species in six families were recorded. Some butterfly species were restricted to shady areas, but most butterflies were abundant in sunny areas. Butterflies in some families (Family Lycanidae, Nymphalidae, Pieridae) were abundant in sunny conditions and some families (Family Hesperiidae, Papilionidae) abundant in shade. ANOVA was conducted to identify the variation of number of species (F= 54. 05, p< 0. 001) and among abundance (F= 10. 49, p< 0. 05) with the canopy cover. Species richness was high in moderate canopy cover (20 ± 5 %). Negative Pearson correlation coefficient stated butterfly abundance decreased with the canopy cover (r=- 0. 91) and species richness decreased with canopy cover (r=- 0. 85). Some butterflies were common in sunny areas and some species were confined to shady areas. However, most of the species were generally found throughout the <b>area.</b> <b>Regenerating</b> forest encountered more shrubs than in young secondary forest, which butterflies preferred to food on. Main findings of the study were that butterfly abundance was high in sunny areas and butterfly species richness was high in moderate shady areas...|$|E

In addition, the construction of railway station back then has physically occupied the city partially in a linear fashion and variously influenced the urban space. The importance of the railway station in the city was mentioned in the Building News in 1872, that the “Railway termini and hotels are to the nineteenth century what monasteries and cathedrals were to the thirteenth century. ” After 130 years, Ferrarini(2005) explained that while factories are isolated in the suburb area, railway station is one of the most industrial structures located in the center of the city supporting the city function as a complex facility. Furthermore, he referred to the railway station the possibility as a city facility among the typical facilities being decided by the function as a school, museum, library, City Hall or factory. From recent projects, such as Japan's Tokyo Station Restoration project, Paris’ Gare du Nord and the surrounding <b>area</b> <b>regenerating</b> project, New York's High Line project, and Busan's Integrated Regeneration of the old harbor project, railway station, since the nineteenth century's industrial revolution, is not only functioning as the daily use, but also the accelerator in regenerating the old city with its historical background.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to identify and monitor forest regeneration {{for a period of}} eight years after deforestation events occurred in 2001 in the Eastern Amazon region. The study utilized Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images acquired for scene 224 / 65 (path/row), for the following dates: 07 / 06 / 2000 (Geocover product), 08 / 02 / 2001, 08 / 29 / 2002, 07 / 04 / 2005 (Geocover product) and 08 / 08 / 2009. Deforestation data was obtained from the PRODES deforestation mapping program for the year 2001. The results showed a large and increasing area of forest regeneration within the area and period of study. The first year after deforestation showed the highest proportion of regeneration (20 %), which {{can be attributed to the}} known pattern of less intensive land use in the initial years after vegetation removal, associated with stem regeneration and germination from the remaining seed banks. The proportion of <b>regenerated</b> <b>area</b> decreased over the years (through new deforestation of <b>regenerating</b> <b>areas),</b> but still occupied 13 % of the area deforested in 2001 at the end of the eight-year period (2001 - 2009). Another important result showed that from the total <b>area</b> <b>regenerated</b> by 2009, 60 % started the recovery process immediately after the 2001 deforestation event, and had no evidence of economic use during the studied period (i. e. no justification exists for the observed deforestation in the first place).
