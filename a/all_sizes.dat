5|$|Female Murray cod, upon first {{reaching}} sexual maturity, have egg {{counts of}} no more than 10,000. Very large female Murray cod can have egg counts as high as 80,000–90,000, although a recent, very large 33-kg specimen yielded an egg count of 110,000 viable eggs. Egg counts in female Murray cod of <b>all</b> <b>sizes</b> are relatively low compared to many fish species.|$|E

5|$|A female P. labiata {{more often}} pursues small jumping spiders and web spiders than larger prey. While it more often catches small jumping spiders than larger ones, {{it is about}} equally {{effective}} with <b>all</b> <b>sizes</b> of web spiders up to twice P. labiata′s size. A female P. labiata is effective against insects up to twice P. labiata′s size when the insect is stuck in a non-salticid's web, and against insects not in webs and up to P. labiata′s size, while P. labiata seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in the open. A female P. labiata very seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in her own web, and is slightly less effective against smaller insects in P. labiata′s web than in other situations. Males are less efficient in all cases.|$|E
5|$|As the Japanese ships {{continued}} to pound the Tsesarevich, the battleship , followed shortly afterward by Peresvet, boldly charged Tōgō's battleline {{in an attempt}} to divert the Japanese shellfire. The Japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to the oncoming ships, badly damaging both and forcing them to turn away. Ukhtomsky signaled the other Russian ships to follow him back to Port Arthur, but the signal was hard to discern because the flags had to be hung from the bridge railings without the topmasts and were only gradually recognized. Peresvet received a total of 39 hits of <b>all</b> <b>sizes</b> that killed 13 men and wounded 69. Her forward 12-inch turret was knocked out and several hits near the waterline caused flooding; compartments of the double bottom had to be counterflooded to restore some of her stability. Repairs took until late September.|$|E
5|$|Paper {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} discoveries of ancient China. Beginning in the 3rd century BCE paper was made in <b>all</b> <b>sizes</b> with various materials. Silk was no exception, and silk workers had been making paper since the 2nd century BCE. Silk, bamboo, linen, wheat and rice straw were all used differently, and paper made with silk became the first type of luxury paper. Researchers have found an early example of writing done on silk paper in the tomb of a Marchioness who died around 168, in Mawangdui, Changsha, Hunan. The material was certainly more expensive, but also more practical than bamboo slips. Treatises on many subjects, including meteorology, medicine, astrology, divinity, and even maps written on silk have been discovered.|$|E

Larger larvae also occurred on upper surfaces, but were more evenly dispersed over all surfaces than smaller larvae, and tended to aggregate on down-stream faces of rocks during high flow...|$|R

5|$|Threats to Bridgeoporus nobilissimus include {{extirpation}} {{of known}} and unknown habitats by logging, fire, or other disturbances, and forestry practices {{that lead to}} the loss of large-diameter Abies procera and Abies amabilis trees and large-diameter stumps and snags in managed forests. Due to the scarcity of its mature tree hosts, B.nobilissimus was listed in 1995 as an endangered species by the Oregon Natural Heritage Program, making it the first of the fungi to be listed as endangered by any private or public agency in the United States. It is the sole fungus in category A of the survey and management guidelines for fungi under the Northwest Forest Plan, meaning pre-disturbance surveys and site management are needed before developing areas known to harbor the fungus. There were 13 known sites with the fungus before 1998; extensive surveying in the Pacific Northwest increased this number to 103 sites by 2006. Although it is infrequently observed, the fungus is more abundant than fruit body appearance indicates. Using genetic markers to detect the fungus mycelium in hosts, researchers found that B.nobilissimus was present at low to moderate levels and widespread in forest stands containing at least a single visible fruit body. It was detected in trees of <b>all</b> <b>sizes,</b> and in species not previously thought to harbor the fungus. B.nobilissimus may require decades of mycelial growth in its host before fruit body production is initiated. The fungus has not been successively grown in vitro despite several attempts.|$|E
