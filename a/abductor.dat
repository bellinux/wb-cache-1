5|$|A similar {{situation}} arose outside the apartment. A crowd {{gathered by the}} front door of 5A, including next to the children's bedroom window—through which an <b>abductor</b> may have entered or left—trampling on evidence. An officer dusted the bedroom window's exterior shutter for fingerprints without wearing gloves or other protective clothing.|$|E
5|$|Abduction of marriage-age {{women was}} common during the Liao dynasty. Khitans men of all social classes {{participated in the}} activity, and the abductees were both Khitan and Han. In some cases, this was {{a step in the}} {{courtship}} process, where the woman would agree to the abduction and the resulting sexual intercourse, and then the <b>abductor</b> and abductee would return to the woman's home to announce their intention to marry. This process was known as baimen (拜門). In other cases, the abduction would be non-consensual and would result in a rape.|$|E
5|$|Anderson and Ward {{devise a}} plan to indict members of the Klan for the murders. They arrange a {{kidnapping}} of Mayor Tilman, taking him to a remote shack. There, he is left with a black man, who threatens to castrate him unless he talks. The <b>abductor</b> is an FBI operative assigned to intimidate Tilman, who gives him a full description of the killings, including {{the names of those}} involved. Although his statement is not admissible in court due to coercion, Tilman's information proves valuable to the investigators.|$|E

5|$|The resort's {{staff had}} left a note in a message book at the swimming-pool {{reception}} area, asking that the same table, which overlooked the apartments, be block-booked for 20:30 for the McCanns and friends every evening {{for the last four}} evenings of the holiday. The message said the group's children were asleep in the apartments. Madeleine's mother believes the <b>abductor</b> may have seen the note.|$|E
5|$|In the UK Control Risks, a British {{security}} company—paid by {{an anonymous}} donor {{to assist the}} McCanns since 7 May—took hair samples from the McCann twins on 24 September, at their parents' request. The twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the <b>abductor</b> might have given the children sedatives. According to the Polícia Judiciária files, Kate had asked them to take samples, {{three months after the}} disappearance, but they had not done so. Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found.|$|E

5|$|Leaving {{a bowling}} alley, student Taylor Watts (Jacinda Barrett) is {{abducted}} by two men. As she is dragged into a car, her dropped purse shows {{that her father}} is Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). Watts is then seen briefing Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents on the kidnapping, as a witness describes one <b>abductor,</b> who was wearing a mask like those issued to U.S. troops in the Gulf War. FBI agent Emma Hollis (Klea Scott) remarks to the agents that Watts failed to mention of the Millennium Group or those opposed to it in his briefing, and that her partner Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), who has been investigating the Group, is absent.|$|E
25|$|The <b>abductor</b> hallucis {{stretches}} {{along the}} medial {{edge of the}} foot, from the calcaneus {{to the base of}} the first phalanx of the first digit and the medial sesamoid bone. It is an <b>abductor</b> and a weak flexor, and also helps maintain the arch of the foot. Lateral to the <b>abductor</b> hallucis is the flexor hallucis brevis, which originates from the medial cuneiform bone and from the tendon of the tibialis posterior. The flexor hallucis has a medial and a lateral head inserted laterally to the <b>abductor</b> hallucis. It is an important plantar flexor which comes into prominent use in classical ballet (i.e. for pointe work).|$|E
25|$|The {{extensor}} pollicis brevis (EPB) originates on the ulna {{distal to}} the <b>abductor</b> pollicis longus, from the interosseus membrane, {{and from the}} dorsal side of the radius. Passing through the first tendon compartment together with the <b>abductor</b> pollicis longus, it {{is attached to the}} base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. It extends the thumb and, because of its close relationship to the long <b>abductor,</b> also abducts the thumb. It is innervated by the deep branch of the radial nerve (C7-T1).|$|E

50|$|Haley, Jackson, McClain and Christmas {{were killed}} as the <b>abductors</b> {{attempted}} {{to drive away}} from the courthouse. Haley was apparently hit by fire from a sawed-off shotgun that had been fastened to his neck with adhesive tape by the <b>abductors.</b> Magee was severely wounded, Thomas {{was shot in the}} spine and left paralyzed, and one of the female hostages was also wounded.|$|R
50|$|Harald Kleber, {{who worked}} for Gruenhelme, was kidnapped by unknown gunmen in Herat Province on December 16, 2007. On March 14, 2008, it was {{reported}} that the <b>abductors</b> demanded $50,000 dollars ransom for his release. The <b>abductors</b> had initially demanded $100,000 dollars for his release but decreased the amount. Kleber was killed sometime after that because the ransom they demanded was not paid.|$|R

25|$|Extension is {{effected}} {{mainly by}} the <b>abductor</b> pollicis longus, assisted by the extensores pollicis longus and brevis.|$|E
25|$|Adduction {{is carried}} out by the adductor; {{abduction}} mainly by the <b>abductor</b> pollicis longus and brevis, assisted by the extensors.|$|E
50|$|After having {{stopped in}} a {{pedestrian}} area in Cologne at 11:00am, {{the car was}} surrounded by media and shoppers. Some reporters offered to guide the <b>abductors</b> on their way or to hand them pictures of police officers to prevent trickery if hostages were exchanged. A reporter guided the <b>abductors</b> to a nearby rest area on an Autobahn and accompanied them for several kilometers.|$|R
5000|$|The militants {{released}} Valderama on June 12, after a ransom {{payment of}} 100,000 pesos ($2,250). Negotiator Isnaji Alvarez {{stated that the}} <b>abductors</b> gave Drilon’s family until June 17 to pay 1.12 million dollars, but a deadline for the other two hostages was unclear. Xinhua, reported that the “militants had set a deadline of Tuesday noon for a ransom of 15 million pesos (337,079 U.S. dollars), local media reported Monday.” Isnaji earlier said “the <b>abductors</b> demanded 20 million pesos (US$450,000) in ransom.” Minutes before the deadline, the kidnappers extended [...] "Indefinitely" [...] the deadline {{for the release of}} Drilon and her companions, with the <b>abductors</b> requesting livelihood products in exchange for their freedom.|$|R
50|$|It {{appears that}} Sarkis Zeitlian {{was killed by}} his <b>abductors.</b> However, the details remain mired in controversy.|$|R
25|$|The dorsal blood supply, {{particularly}} of the proximal portion, is highly variable. Sometimes the fibers of the <b>abductor</b> pollicis brevis {{emerge from the}} tubercle.|$|E
25|$|The palmar {{surface is}} rounded and rough, and gives {{attachment}} to the transverse carpal ligament, the flexor carpi ulnaris and the <b>abductor</b> digiti quinti.|$|E
25|$|The <b>abductor</b> pollicis longus (APL) {{originates}} on the dorsal {{sides of}} both the ulna and the radius, and from the interosseous membrane. Passing through the first tendon compartment, it inserts {{to the base of}} the first metacarpal bone. A part of the tendon reaches the trapezium, while another fuses with the tendons of the extensor pollicis brevis and the <b>abductor</b> pollicis brevis. Except for abducting the hand, it flexes the hand towards the palm and abducts it radially. It is innervated by the deep branch of the radial nerve (C7-C8).|$|E

25|$|The opponens digiti minimi {{originates}} {{from the}} long plantar ligament and the plantar tendinous sheath of peroneus longus and is inserted on the fifth metatarsal. When present, it acts to plantar flex the fifth digit and supports the plantar arch. The flexor digiti minimi arises from the region of base of the fifth metatarsal and is inserted onto {{the base of the}} first phalanx of the fifth digit where it is usually merged with the <b>abductor</b> of the first digit. It acts to plantar flex the last digit. The largest and longest muscles of the little toe is the <b>abductor</b> digiti minimi. Stretching from the lateral process of the calcaneus, with a second attachment on the base of the fifth metatarsal, {{to the base of the}} fifth digit's first phalanx, the muscle forms the lateral edge of the sole. Except for supporting the arch, it plantar flexes the little toe and also acts as an <b>abductor.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>abductor</b> pollicis brevis (APB) {{originates}} on the scaphoid tubercle and the flexor retinaculum. It inserts to the radial {{sesamoid bone}} and the proximal phalanx of the thumb. It is innervated by the median nerve (C8-T1).|$|E
25|$|Deportation and {{expulsion}} {{options are}} frequently quite successful at returning child abductors and children, but {{can only be}} used when the <b>abductor</b> is not a citizen of Mexico as the Mexican Constitution prohibits the deportation of its citizens.|$|E

5000|$|Abductees of {{all ages}} and genders {{sometimes}} report being subjected to a [...] "child presentation." [...] As its name implies, the child presentation involves the abduction claimant being shown a [...] "child." [...] Often the children appear to be neither human, nor the same species as the <b>abductors.</b> Instead, the child will almost always share characteristics of both species. These children are labeled by experiencers as hybrids between humans and their <b>abductors,</b> usually Greys.|$|R
5000|$|Karla {{hears the}} <b>abductor's</b> voice from her son's toy voice recorder, {{revealing}} the <b>abductor's</b> name Margo, who claims that Karla {{is looking for}} her son (despite all attempts to discourage her). Margo sees Karla talking over the phone. She then sees a police motorcycle several meters behind her. Hoping to stop the abductors' car, Karla sways her car. The abductors' car slams the police motorcycle into Karla's car, apparently knocking the police officer unconscious.|$|R
