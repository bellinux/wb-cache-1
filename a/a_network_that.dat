5|$|The {{essence of}} network {{synthesis}} {{is to start}} with a required filter response and produce <b>a</b> <b>network</b> <b>that</b> delivers that response, or approximates to it within a specified boundary. This is the inverse of network analysis which starts with a given network and by applying the various electric circuit theorems predicts the response of the network. The term was first used with this meaning in the doctoral thesis of Yuk-Wing Lee (1930) and apparently arose out of a conversation with Vannevar Bush. The advantage of network synthesis over previous methods is that it provides a solution which precisely meets the design specification. This is not the case with image filters, a degree of experience is required in their design since the image filter only meets the design specification in the unrealistic case of being terminated in its own image impedance, to produce which would require the exact circuit being sought. Network synthesis on the other hand, takes care of the termination impedances simply by incorporating them into the network being designed.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} of the Maya covered a third of Mesoamerica, and the Maya {{were engaged in a}} dynamic relationship with neighbouring cultures that included the Olmecs, Mixtecs, Teotihuacan, the Aztecs, and others. During the Early Classic period, the Maya cities of Tikal and Kaminaljuyu were key Maya foci in <b>a</b> <b>network</b> <b>that</b> extended beyond the Maya area into the highlands of central Mexico. At around the same time, there was a strong Maya presence at the Tetitla compound of Teotihuacan. Centuries later, during the 9th century AD, murals at Cacaxtla, another site in the central Mexican highlands, were painted in a Maya style. This may have been either an effort to align itself with the still-powerful Maya area after the collapse of Teotihuacan and ensuing political fragmentation in the Mexican Highlands, or an attempt to express a distant Maya origin of the inhabitants. The Maya city of Chichen Itza and the distant Toltec capital of Tula had an especially close relationship.|$|E

25|$|The {{first of}} three late-20th century {{emigration}} waves began in 1961 after the assassination of dictator Trujillo, due to fear of retaliation by Trujillo's allies and political uncertainty in general. In 1965 the United States began a military occupation of the Dominican Republic to end a civil war. Upon this, the U.S. eased travel restrictions, {{making it easier for}} Dominicans to obtain U.S. visas. From 1966 to 1978, the exodus continued, fueled by high unemployment and political repression. Communities established by the first wave of immigrants to the U.S. created <b>a</b> <b>network</b> <b>that</b> assisted subsequent arrivals.|$|E
25|$|A {{trunk line}} between Berlin and Munich was {{contained}} in the German railway network proposed by Friedrich List in 1833. The line between Erlangen and Ebensfeld {{was part of the}} extension built in the 1840s as part of the Ludwig South-North Railway (Ludwig-Süd-Nord-Bahn). The current route, which was opened in 1851, was not based on comprehensive transport planning, but was a consequence of <b>a</b> <b>network</b> <b>that</b> evolved from 1840 out of lines built to serve local purposes. Since then line improvements and technical upgrades have taken place. After German reunification, the lines were restored, renovated and electrified.|$|E

HBO experienced another success among viewers in 2008, with {{the debut of}} True Blood, a vampire drama based {{on a series of}} gothic novels by Charlaine Harris. The network saw three more hit series in the 2010s with Game of Thrones, based on George R. R. Martin's fantasy novel series A Song of Ice and Fire, which earned both critical and viewer praise; Girls, a comedy series created by series star Lena Dunham; and True Detective, an anthology-style series – structured to feature a different cast and setting within each season's storyline – which initially saw established film actors Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey in its lead roles.|$|E
25|$|Around 100BC, the Adena {{evolved into}} the Hopewell people, who were named for the farm owned by Captain M. C. Hopewell, where {{evidence}} of their unique culture was discovered. Like the Adena, the Hopewell people participated in a mound-building culture. Their complex, large and technologically sophisticated earthworks {{can be found in}} modern-day Marietta, Newark, and Circleville. They were also a powerful trading society, managing to knit together <b>a</b> <b>network</b> <b>that</b> passed goods throughout a third of the continent. The Hopewell, however, disappeared from the Ohio Valley in about 600AD. Little is known about the people who replaced them, although many Siouan-speaking peoples from the Plains & East Coast claim them as ancestors & say they lived throughout the Ohio region until approx. the 13th century. It is possible that the rise of the Mississippian Culture was the downfall of the Hopewell, as they began to rise to prominence on the Mississippi River around {{the same time that the}} Hopewell Culture died out.|$|E
25|$|However, the ITO faced {{opposition}} from Spence Caldwell, a former CBC executive {{and one of}} the unsuccessful applicants for the Toronto licence, who had first approached the BBG in April 1960 to pitch a second-station network proposal of his own. Under his plan, at least 51% of the shares of the network would be owned by various prominent Bay Street investors who had previously backed his Toronto station bid; only 49% would be reserved for the network's affiliates to purchase, if they wished. The BBG – and particularly its chair Andrew Stewart (who at the time also served {{as the president of the}} University of Alberta) – was not in favour of a station-owned network, fearing that the Toronto station would eventually come to dominate it. Although it did not immediately approve Caldwell's proposal, it soon set several conditions on such <b>a</b> <b>network</b> <b>that</b> effectively made Caldwell's group the only feasible applicant.|$|E

Wadah Khanfar, the then {{managing director of}} the Arabic Channel, was appointed as the director general of Al Jazeera Media Network. He also acted as the {{managing director of the}} Arabic Channel. Khanfar resigned on 20 September 2011 proclaiming that he had achieved his original goals, and that 8 years was enough time for any leader of an organization, in an interview aired on Al Jazeera English. Ahmed bin Jassim Al Thani replaced Khanfar and served as the director general of the channel from September 2011 to June 2013 when he was appointed minister of economy and trade. The chairman of the channel is Hamad bin Thamer Al Thani. The Director General and editor-in-chief of the Arabic website is Mostefa Souag, who replaced Ahmed Sheikh as editor-in-chief. It has more than 100 editorial staff. The managing director of Al Jazeera English is Al Anstey. Mohamed Nanabhay became editor-in-chief of the English-language site in 2009. Previous editors include Beat Witschi and Russell Merryman.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, we {{know that}} Praetextatus' family was ancient and noble, and {{therefore}} he possessed a network of relationships {{with other members of}} the senatorial aristocracy, <b>a</b> <b>network</b> <b>that</b> was used also to gain advantages. His acquaintances included Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, his father Lucius Aurelius Avianius Symmachus, Virius Nicomachus Flavianus and probably the senators Volusius Venustus and Minervius. An example of this network of relationships is the very wedding between Praetextatus and his wife Aconia Fabia Paulina, celebrated around 344 (they had been married for 40 years in 384); Paulina, in fact, was the daughter of Fabius Aconius Catullinus Philomathius, Praefectus urbi in 342–344 and Consul in 349. They had at least one son, recalled in the funeral eulogy and the author of an inscription in honour of his father, dated to little time after his death and found in their home on the Aventine. Even if most historians identify the commissioner of the inscription with a son, this could be also a daughter, maybe the Praetextata cited by Jerome. Finally, Vettius Agorius Basilius Mavortius, Consul in 527 and with an interest in literature that Praetextatus had, could have been his great-grandson.|$|E
