5|$|Subarachnoid blood can be {{detected}} on CT scanning {{in as many as}} 60 percent of people with traumatic brain injury. Traumatic SAH (tSAH) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion. It usually happens in the setting of other forms of traumatic brain injury and has been linked with a poorer prognosis. It is unclear, however, if this is <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack at}} Sinsinawa Mound, {{compounded}} by other incidents around the region, helped {{contribute to the}} fear gripping the settlers. The people of Platteville, in present-day Wisconsin, contemplated fleeing to Galena, about 25 miles (40 km) south, as <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sinsinawa Mound raid. Colonel Dodge dispatched one of his men, Frederick Hollman, to Platteville to reassure its nervous residents. However, by the time Hollman arrived the settlers had already been informed that the local Native American Ho-Chunk tribesmen were friendly. This and the subsequent delivery of promised supplies from Galena further placated Platteville's residents, and the threatened exodus was called off.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{coverage}} is erratic, <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sources that Bewick consulted: his own knowledge of British animals, the available scholarly sources, combined with George Culley's 1786 Observations on Livestock and the antique John Caius's 1576 On English Dogs. Bewick had {{to hand the}} Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman's account of {{his visit to the}} Cape of Good Hope on Cook's expedition of 1772 to 1776, and animals from the Southern Cape figure largely in the book. It was an energetic muddle, but it was at once greeted with enthusiasm by the British public. They liked the combination of vigorous woodcuts, simple and accurate descriptions, and all kinds of exotic animals alongside things they knew.|$|E

5|$|The urban {{landscape}} of the cities changed dramatically during this period. The Praetorian Building in Dallas (1907) and the Amicable Life Insurance Company building in Waco (1911) {{were among the first}} skyscrapers in Texas. The Perlstein Building in Beaumont was the first skyscraper built as <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boom. Beaumont's downtown grew rapidly during the first decade after the 1901 strike. After a second major strike at Spindletop in 1925, Beaumont had the largest skyline of any city between Houston and New Orleans {{by the end of the}} decade. The twenty–two story Edson Hotel, completed in 1929, was the tallest hotel building in Texas for several years.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the emperor Hadrian the {{proportion}} of Italians in the legions had fallen to just ten percent and provincial citizens now dominated. This low figure is probably <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> changing needs of military staffing: a system of fixed border defences (Latin: limes) were established around the Empire's periphery under Hadrian, consolidating Trajan's territorial gains. These called for troops to be stationed permanently in the provinces, a prospect more attractive to locally raised rather than Italian troops. The higher prestige and pay {{to be found in the}} Italian dominated Praetorian Guard must also have played a role. The majority of the troops in the legions at the start of the 3rd centuryAD were from the more Romanised (though non-Italian) provinces, especially Illyria. As the century progressed, more and more barbarians (Latin: barbari) were permitted to settle inside of, and tasked with aiding in the defence of, Rome's borders. As a result, greater numbers of barbarous and semi-barbarous peoples were gradually admitted to the army.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies the valley floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the basalt below the valley floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, is <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples are composed primarily of plagioclase, but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and other minerals.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman naval {{presence}} at Beirut was completely annihilated, removing the only Turkish naval threat to Italian transports {{in the area}} and giving the Italians complete naval dominance of the southern Mediterranean Sea {{for the rest of the}} war. Casualties on the Ottoman side were heavy. Both Ottoman warships were sunk, with Avnillah alone taking 58 killed and 108 wounded. In contrast the Italian ships not only took no casualties, but no direct hits from the Ottoman warships as well. The damage was not restricted to the Ottoman naval vessels present at Beirut, as the city took heavy damage as well. Stray shots from the cruisers decimated the city. Fires broke out as <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stray gunfire, destroying several banks and part of the city's customs house as well as other buildings. Combined from the fires and shelling, 66 civilians were killed in the city along with hundreds of others wounded.|$|E
5|$|The central {{conflict}} in many Final Fantasy games {{focuses on a}} group of characters battling an evil, and sometimes ancient, antagonist that dominates the game's world. Stories frequently involve a sovereign state in rebellion, with the protagonists taking part in the rebellion. The heroes are often destined to defeat the evil, and occasionally gather as <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antagonist's malicious actions. Another staple of the series is the existence of two villains; the main villain is not always who it appears to be, as the primary antagonist may actually be subservient to another character or entity. The main antagonist introduced {{at the beginning of the}} game is not always the final enemy, and the characters must continue their quest beyond what appears to be the final fight.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} slaves in Indiana were {{owned by the}} French traders who entered the region and introduced the practice to the native tribes. Jesuit priests encouraged the tribes they lived among to adopt slavery {{as an alternative to}} executing their prisoners in war. According to some classical historians, the decline of cannibalism among the tribes was <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rise of slavery. Early slaves were often Native Americans who were sold to pay debts. The early slaves typically performed manual labor, helping the traders transport their goods and to build forts and trading posts. While part of new France, laws were enacted to give slaves some protection from their masters. Torture and mutilation of slaves was forbidden, and families were prevented from being forcibly broken up. Other laws allowed slaves to be seized by creditors as payment. Other laws required that if a master had children by a slave, the slave and her children were then to be freed. Their status under the French laws was similar to that of minors.|$|E

5|$|Lingbao scriptures arose as <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{success of}} earlier Shangqing texts. Lingbao scriptures are {{all based on}} a text known as the Text of the Five Talismans (Wufujing), which was {{compiled}} by Ge Chaofu between 397 and 402 and borrowed {{from the work of}} Ge Hong, his great uncle. Being the most ancient Lingbao text, the Five Talismans provided the framework of the remainder of the Lingbao canon, which was based on the five directions. Because all Lingbao texts descended from the Five Talismans, it was believed that they had been revealed to Ge Xuan, presumably the original owner of the Five Talismans. Ge Xuan is purported to have transmitted the Lingbao texts first to his disciple Zheng Siyuan, who then transmitted it to Ge's grandnephew Ge Hong (284-364), who is well known for his alchemical innovations. The claim that the Lingbao texts derive from Ge Xuan, however, was likely a way of legitimizing them through the exaggeration of their antiquity. In reality, they were likely assembled by Ge Chaofu himself. Within a few years of the texts' dissemination, they had become extremely popular.|$|E
5|$|Some of Antarctica {{has been}} warming up; {{particularly}} strong warming {{has been noted}} on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted {{for the first time}} that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05°C (0.09°F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1°C (0.2°F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> much greater atmospheric warming there.|$|E
5|$|The HV and {{the special}} police {{suffered}} 174211 killed or missing, while the ARSK had 560 soldiers killed. Four UN peacekeepers were also killed. The HV captured 4,000 prisoners of war. The number of Serb civilian deaths is disputedCroatia claims that 214 were killed, while Serbian sources cite 1,192 civilians killed or missing. During and after the offensive, 150,000–200,000 Serbs—or nearly the entire Serb population of the area formerly held by the ARSK—fled {{and a variety of}} crimes were committed against the remaining civilians there. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) later tried three Croatian generals charged with war crimes and partaking in a joint criminal enterprise designed to force the Serb population out of Croatia, although all three were ultimately acquitted and the tribunal refuted charges of a criminal enterprise. In 2010, Serbia sued Croatia before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), claiming that the offensive constituted a genocide. In 2015, the court ruled that it was not genocidal, and it affirmed that the Serb population fled as <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> offensive, although Croatia did not have the specific intent to displace the country's Serb minority, nor was it found that ethnic cleansing or civilian targeting took place. However, it was found that crimes against civilians had been committed by Croatian forces. , the Croatian judiciary has convicted 2,380 persons for various crimes committed during Operation Storm.|$|E

5|$|The anti-Hindi {{imposition}} agitations of 1937–40 and 1940–50 led to {{a change}} of guard in the Madras Presidency. The main opposition party to the Indian National Congress in the state, the Justice Party, came under Periyar's leadership on 29 December 1938. In 1944, the Justice Party was renamed as Dravidar Kazhagam. The political careers of many later leaders of the Dravidian Movement, such as C. N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi, started with their participation in these agitations. The agitations stopped the compulsory teaching of Hindi in the state. The agitations of the 1960s {{played a crucial role}} in the defeat of the Tamil Nadu Congress party in the 1967 elections and the continuing dominance of Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu politics. Many political leaders of the DMK and ADMK, like P. Seenivasan, K. Kalimuthu, Durai Murugan, Tiruppur. S. Duraiswamy, Sedapatti Muthaiah, K. Raja Mohammad, M. Natarajan and L. Ganesan, owe their entry and advancement in politics to their stints as student leaders during the agitations, which also reshaped the Dravidian Movement and broadened its political base, when it shifted from its earlier pro-Tamil (and anti-Brahmin) stance to a more inclusive one, which was both anti-Hindi and pro-English. Finally, the current two-language education policy followed in Tamil Nadu is also <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agitations.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} the game's fictional locations, the team tried to represent iconic {{features of the}} American frontier; New Austin features small towns and outposts, Nuevo Paraíso includes rebel outposts and Mexican army forts, and West Elizabeth represents the civilized areas of the world. These three locations represent a developing nation, a province {{on the brink of}} war, and an advanced nation, respectively. The American frontier was extensively researched for the game. The team organized field trips to Washington, visited the Library of Congress, captured a multitude of photographs, and analyzed various classic Western films. A challenge that the team faced as <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's size was to include enough content to interest players.
