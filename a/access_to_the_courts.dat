25|$|The modern law of {{contract}} is primarily {{a creature of the}} industrial revolution and the social legislation of the 20th century. However, the foundations of all European contract law are traceable to obligations in Ancient Athenian and Roman law, while the formal development of English law began after the Norman Conquest of 1066. William the Conqueror created a common law across England, but throughout the middle ages the court system was minimal. <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts,</b> in what are now considered contractual disputes, was consciously restricted to a privileged few through onerous requirements of pleading, formalities and court fees. In the local and manorial courts, according to English law's first treatise by Ranulf de Glanville in 1188, if people disputed the payment of a debt they, and witnesses, would attend court and swear oaths (called a wager of law). They risked perjury if they lost the case, and so this was strong encouragement to resolve disputes elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} scandal {{occurred}} on Easter Sunday in 1768, in which Sade procured {{the services of}} a woman, Rose Keller, a widow-beggar who approached him for alms. He told her she could make money by working for him—she understood her work to be that of a housekeeper. At his chateau at Arcueil, Sade ripped her clothes off, threw her on a divan and tied her by the four limbs, face-down, so that she could not see behind her. Then he whipped her. Keller testified that he made various incisions on her body into which he poured hot wax, although investigators found no broken skin on Keller, and Sade explained that he had applied ointment to her after the whipping. Keller finally escaped by climbing out of a second-floor window and running away. At this time, la Présidente, Sade's mother-in-law, obtained a lettre de cachet (a royal order of arrest and imprisonment, without stated cause or <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts)</b> from the King, excluding Sade from the jurisdiction of the courts. The lettre de cachet would later prove disastrous for the marquis.|$|E

500|$|In California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508 (1972), the Supreme Court {{stated that}} the right to {{petition}} encompass [...] "the approach of citizens or groups of them to administrative agencies (which are both creatures of the legislature, and arms of the executive) and to courts, the third branch of Government. Certainly the right to petition extends to all departments of the Government. The right of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition." [...] Today thus this right encompasses petitions to all three branches of the federal government—the Congress, the executive and the judiciary—and has been extended to the states through incorporation. According to the Supreme Court, [...] "redress of grievances" [...] is to be construed broadly: it includes not solely appeals by the public to the government for the redressing of a grievance in the traditional sense, but also, petitions on behalf of private interests seeking personal gain. The right not only protects demands for [...] "a redress of grievances" [...] but also demands for government action. The petition clause includes according to the Supreme Court the opportunity to institute non-frivolous lawsuits and mobilize popular support to change existing laws in a peaceful manner.|$|E

2500|$|The High Court of Australia {{has shown}} {{resistance}} to privative clauses, holding {{that the ability}} of legislatures to insulate administrative tribunals from judicial review by means of such clauses is restricted by the Constitution of Australia, particularly section75(v) which states: [...] "In all matters... in which a writ of Mandamus or prohibition or an injunction is sought against {{an officer of the}} Commonwealth... the High Court shall have original jurisdiction."

Defenders of the court argue that it has provided easier <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts.</b> They also note that the argument that the court would not be independent has been disproved by the Supreme Court's willingness to overrule decisions of the Court of Appeal.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{explanation}} {{of the scope of}} the rights protected by the clause, Justice Washington included the right to travel through and reside in states, the right to claim benefit of the writ of heabeas corpus, the right of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts,</b> the right to purchase and hold property, and an exemption from higher taxes than state residents pay. The Corfield case involved the rights of an out-of-state citizen, rather than the rights of an in-state citizen, and Justice Washington's opinion did not suggest that this provision of the Constitution addresses how a legislature must treat its own citizens.

40|$|Many {{states have}} {{implemented}} laws which limit non-economic (e. g., pain and suffering) damages {{as a result}} of medical malpractice. These laws are seen by proponents as reducing medical malpractice insurance costs and preserving <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health care – especially for lower income individuals. Opponents believe that individuals are harmed through being prevented from seeking a full measure of redress for medical malpractice incidents, by reducing <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> system, and that these laws simply enrich insurance companies and doctors. Federal lawmakers are currently studying the potential effect of uniform medical malpractice damage limits at the national level. It is therefore of interest to legal scholars, policy makers and <b>the</b> public <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> actual effects of such laws. We find that limits do not reduce <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> system, yet reduce <b>the</b> incentive <b>to</b> litigate <b>the</b> weakest claims, reduce the average size of malpractice awards, and reduce total loss costs (a measure of insurance provider payments/losses).
