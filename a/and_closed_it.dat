Oliver Jones Huie was {{selected}} by Ga Tech's athletic association to coach the football team for the 1903 season when the team won 3 and lost 5 games. A professional coach was desperately needed if Tech wished to build a truly competitive football program. The {{first game of the}} 1903 season was a 73–0 destruction at the hands of John Heisman's Clemson; shortly after the season, Tech offered Heisman a coaching position.|$|E

In August 2008 the museum opened a retail gift shop in The Streets of Tanasbourne shopping center, <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>it</b> in December 2009 {{due to the}} economic recession. This satellite gift shop {{was to be a}} temporary endeavor, and was designed in part to help drive traffic to the museum. By 2010 the museum's collections had grown to more than 20,000 specimens, and still had about 25,000 visitors annually, with about 18,000 coming from school field trips. Tschernich stepped down as curator in 2011, with Lara O'Dwyer-Brown taking over the position in 2012. Brown left in 2014, with Julian Gray hired as executive director and Leslie Moclock as curator in May 2014.|$|E

After four years and $36 million in renovations, it reopened, {{but it was never}} the same; it closed with little notice on Sunday, July 28, 2002, after declaring bankruptcy. LeRoy's health was failing. Also, the local economy did not recover quickly enough to make payments on the substantial loans for the renovations.|$|E
25|$|Both KSS and KES {{were taken}} over by the {{municipality}} in 1924, when their concessions expired. Oslo Municipality thereby established a new municipally-owned company, Oslo Sporveier, to operate all street trams in Oslo. KSS continued to use the Class S trams until 1918. However, many of the trams were rebuilt to other models and these remained in service until 1966. KSS had no need for Rodeløkka Depot <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>it</b> down immediately after the take-over. The Rodeløkka Line was closed in 1949, although the southern part is still in operation as part of the Sinsen Line. Sagene Ring closed in 1961, and the Vippetangen Line followed suit six years later.|$|E

After having lost 10 million kroner of its investment, Tenvig decided to {{withdraw}} from the airline <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>it</b> down in April 1987. However, seventy percent of the company was bought by Helikopter Service. The airline started operations again in August, legally as a new company, Nye Partnair A/S. It soon reverted to the former name. After about a year the company was again running without a deficit and Helikopter Service sold its shares to the brothers Terje and Rolf Thoresen. From then the company started losing money and had a poor financial result in 1988. That year the airline operated three Convairs and six Super King Airs. In terms of revenue, it was the fifth-largest airline in Norway, with 80 employees.|$|E

25|$|On August 19, 2015, the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned 15 Mexican businesses, {{including}} Hotelito Desconocido, {{under the}} Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (also {{known as the}} Kingpin Act). According to the sanction, Hotelito Desconocido served as a money laundering front that provided financial and material assistance to Los Cuinis and their leader Abigael González Valencia (brother of Tobares' last employer Gerardo). All of Hotelito Desconocido's assets in the U.S. were frozen, and U.S. citizens were prohibited from engaging in business with this entity. The sanctioned also extended to six Mexican individuals linked to Los Cuinis. That same day, federal agents from Mexico's Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR) confiscated Hotelito Desconocido <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>it</b> down. This action was done following a formal request done through the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit and by the exchange of information with U.S. officials.|$|E
25|$|The {{same day}} the Kingpin Act was made public, the PGR seized Hotelito Desconocido <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>it</b> down. This action by the PGR stemmed from suspicions that the hotel was a money {{laundering}} front for the CJNG drug cartel; the Mexican government had leads that Hotelito Desconocido {{was used as a}} legal entity by the CJNG in an attempt to invest money in economy and hide the illegal origins of their drug proceeds. They also added that the CJNG may have used the hotel as a meeting spot for its members. The seizure was done following a formal request done through the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit and by the exchange of information with U.S. officials. The National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV) also froze several Mexican-based bank accounts from a previous investigation they had open. Torres González's assets were temporarily frozen in Mexico. The 14 other businesses sanctioned through the Kingpin Act were not confiscated by the Mexican government that day.|$|E
25|$|In late 2007, {{construction}} {{began on}} a large mixed-use residential, office and retail development located {{on the site of}} the old GW Hospital (Square 54) and just east of the Foggy Bottom-GWU Metrorail station. It was the second-largest undeveloped lot in the District of Columbia at the time of initial construction activity. In 2014, the university assumed ownership of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the oldest private art museum in Washington D.C. and independent college of art and design. The college of art and design became The Corcoran School of the Arts and Design under the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. The National Gallery of Art will acquire many of the 17,000 pieces of art from the Corcoran and the rest will be donated to other museums around the country. In May 2014, GW opened the Milken Institute School of Public Health, a nine-story building that received LEED certification for sustainability features including a green roof, rainwater collection system and special heating and air conditioning technologies that helps mass air displacement. The Textile Museum reopened to the public in March 2015 after the institution merged with the university in 2011 <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>it</b> for renovations two years later.|$|E

500|$|Criswell-Radovan, LLC, a Napa, California-based {{development}} company, {{purchased the}} property in spring 2013, <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>it</b> on September 5, 2013 for a complete renovation. The development project was originally estimated {{to take at least}} a year and was to include overhauls of the interior guest rooms, the Circle Bar, the casino, Frank Sinatra's Celebrity Room theater and a complete exterior upgrade. The casino upgrade sought to restore the Cal Neva's original 6,000-square-foot gaming floor, complete with a full slot machine display and the return of table games. The project was initially planned to finish by December 2014, but reopening was delayed multiple times due to difficulties with construction and financing. The company obtained a $29 million loan in November 2014 that allowed construction to begin. [...] An additional $20 million equity line of credit was also financing the project.|$|E

The cantata text resembles works which his second cousin Johann Ludwig Bach set to music.

The cantata is structured in seven movements in two parts (three and four movements), to be performed {{before and after the}} sermon. It is scored for an intimate ensemble of four vocal soloists, a choir only in the chorale, two horns, two oboes d'amore, taille, strings and continuo.

500|$|The Ashland Mill Bridge was a {{lenticular}} pony {{truss bridge}} over the Pachaug River in Griswold, Connecticut that was built in 1886 by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company.

The bridge served the millyard of the Ashland Cotton Company, in the Jewett City section of Griswold. [...] The bridge was [...] long and crossed a millrace on a skew angle. The Ashland Mill was damaged by arson in March 1994 and subsequently torn down, but the bridge itself remained.
