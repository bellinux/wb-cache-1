5000|$|Within <b>an</b> {{evolutionarily}} stable <b>strategy,</b> several {{scenarios are}} possible, including pure and mixed <b>strategies.</b> <b>A</b> pure <b>strategy</b> is one {{not affected by}} chance, in which an individual only expresses one strategic behavior. [...] In contrast, <b>a</b> mixed <b>strategy</b> describes <b>a</b> scenario involving the probabilistic expression of behaviors among individuals. For example, an individual under <b>a</b> mixed <b>strategy</b> could express one mating tactic, such as sneaking, with a certain frequency and another tactic, such as mate guarding, at all other times. [...] Though <b>a</b> mixed <b>strategy</b> is theoretically possible, {{it has not been}} documented in the context of alternative mating behaviors. Instead, <b>a</b> conditional <b>strategy</b> involving alternative behaviors may best characterize alternative mating strategies.|$|R

They met again on 26 February the day before polling began in the Common Roll election. The consensus at this meeting was that Abel Muzorewa's interim government would win enough seats, when put together with the 20 seats reserved for whites which were all Rhodesian Front, to deny Mugabe victory. However, the early election results in March dented this confidence.|$|E

Smith's teams executed the four corners set so effectively that in 1985 the NCAA instituted a shot clock to speed up play and minimize ball-control offense. Although fellow Kansas alum John McLendon actually invented the four corners offense, Smith got credit for utilizing it in games. Smith was also the author of Basketball: Multiple Offense and Defense, which is the best-selling technical basketball book in history.|$|E

The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower's concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending.
