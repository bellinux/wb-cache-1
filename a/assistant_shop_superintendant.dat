40|$|Background: The Swedish retail {{trading company}} KappAhl has reorganized all the boutiques in Sweden. Before the {{reorganization}} {{many of the}} boutiques consisted of four levels: <b>shop</b> manager, <b>assistant</b> <b>shop</b> manager, department managers and regular personel. After the reorganization <b>assistant</b> <b>shop</b> managers and department managers {{have been replaced by}} a so called “responsibility group” consisting of some of the employees. The change is presented as a decentralisation. Purpose: With this thesis I want to attain knowledge about different change attitudes from the employees before reorganizations, and what different effects that can be the result from an decentralization. Limitations: One shop has been studied closely and that is KappAhl at Gränby outside Uppsala. I have studied the opinions from the employees concerning the decentralization and the effects from this decentralization. Procedure: At the boutique of Gränby I interviewed 13 people from the personel, 12 women and 1 man. The literature I´ve used is about work of change in organisations and effects from decentralizations. Results: The opinions before the reorganization from the employees at the boutique of Gränby were positive from almost everyone. The effects from the decentralization has been very positive. The intra communication at the boutique is better and the personel thought that is was easier to help the customers, for example when the customers has reclaims...|$|R
