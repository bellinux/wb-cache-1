40|$|This is {{a review}} and update on acute {{conditions}} affecting the gingival tissues, including abscesses in the periodontium, necrotizing periodontal diseases, and other acute conditions that cause gingival lesions with acute presentation, such as infectious process {{not associated with}} oral bacterial biofilms, muco-cutanenous disorders, and traumatic and <b>allergic</b> <b>lesions.</b> A periodontal abscess is clinically important since it is a relatively frequent dental emergency, it can compromise the periodontal prognosis of the affected tooth, and because bacteria within the abscess have been identified, mainly {{by the type of}} etiology, and there are clear diffrences between those affecting a previously existing periodontal pocket ahd those affecting healthy sites. Therapy for this acute condition consists of drainage and tissue debridement, with individual evaluation of the need for systemic antimicrobial therapy. the definitive treatment of the pre-existing condition should be accomplished after the acute phase is controlled. Necrotizing periodontal disease (NPD) present three typical clinical features : papilla necrosis, gingival bleeding, and pain. Although the prevalence of these diseases is not high, their importance is clear, since they represent the most severe conditions associated with dental biofilm, with very rapid tissue destruction. In adittion to bacteria, the etiology of NPD includes numerous factors that alter the host response and predispose to these diseases, including HIV infection, malnutrition, stress, and tobacco smoking. The treatment consists of superficial debridement, careful mechanical oral hygiene, rinsing with chlorhexidine, and daily re-evaluation. Systemic antimicrobials may be used adjunctively in severe cases or in non-responding conditions and the best option is metronidazole. Once the acute disease is under control, definitive treatment should be provided, including the adequate therapy for the pre-existing gingivitis or periodontitis. Among other acute conditions affecting the periodontal tissues, but not caused by the microorganisms present in oral biofilms, are infectious diseases, muco-cutaneous diseases and traumatic or <b>allergic</b> <b>lesions.</b> In most cases, the gingival envolvement is not severe, though they are common and may prompt a dental emergency visit.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The causal {{relationship}} between severe allergic conditions and successful pregnancy remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate repro-ductive performance in an experimental mouse model of atopic disease (AD), {{and the appearance}} of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells that have crucial roles in placental formation was examined. In the NC/Nga pregnant mice with moderate skin <b>allergic</b> <b>lesions</b> and an 8. 6 -fold elevation of plasma IgE, significant differences were not detected in the reproductive indices of the number of normal fetuses, abortion rate and placental size. There were few uNK cells in the placenta of AD mice, and they showed a significant decrease regarding the immature subtype as compared with controls. These findings revealed that AD disturbs uNK cell differentiation and provides disadvantageous effects on placental formation, although it does not arrest the pregnancy process. It may be possible that specific immunological conditions behind AD operate favorably to recover the reproductive performance.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} effect of prior sensitization on the removal of antigen and the development of <b>allergic</b> <b>lesions</b> in animals receiving a single large intravenous injection of foreign protein. When a purified protein such as crystallized bovine albumin is injected intravenously into normal rabbits, it is cleared from the blood in a predictable fashion, requiring approximately 2 weeks (1 - 3). Thereafter, for several days, free circulating antibody is demonstrable in increasing titer (3). The blood clearance of antigen occurs in three phases: an early phase of rapid equilibration of antigen between the intravascular and extravascular compartments; a second phase of slow catabolism of antigen; and a final or "immune " phase of rapid antigen elimination by antibody. Since during the "immune " phase of antigen clearance the newly formed antibody is present with excess antigen, free circulating antibody is not demonstrable during this phase. However, the effects of antibody production can be accurately measured by the increased rate at which the antigen is eliminated (4). In a previous study (3), histologie and immunologic observations were made on a large group of normal rabbits injected intravenously with a single dose of crystallized bovine albumin. Cardiovascular, renal, and lymphoid granulomatons lesions were encountered in high incidence. The lesions developed during the "immune " phase of antigen elimination and regressed after th...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{case report}} of {{allergic}} granulomatous prostatitis and its systemic dissemination. A 45 -year-old male visited our hospital with initial symptoms of dysuria, pollakiuria and fever on February 19, 1980. Thereafter, a painless abscess in his left cheek and hard swelling of his right parotid gland appeared. He was hospitalized on March 11 because of hearing difficulties and congestion in the conjunctiva. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities in the chest or abdomen, but a proctological examination showed stone-like hardness of the prostate gland which {{was the size of}} a hen's egg. Laboratory findings indicated peripheral eosinophilia and immunoglobulinemia. X-rays showed multiple coin lesions in the chest and multiple cystic changes in the spleen. Biopsies of the cheek lesion and prostate showed eosinophilic granulation accompanied by fibrinoid necrosis and vasculitis. When steroid administration was started, his symptoms and signs showed dramatic but temporary improvement. The <b>allergic</b> <b>lesions</b> then gradually progressed and resisted the steroid therapy. He died on March 13, 1982. In 1972, Towfighi et al. presented 31 cases of nonspecific granulomatous prostatitis with a comprehensive review of the literature.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{effect of}} {{interleukin}} (IL) - 4 on eosinophil chemotactic lymphokine (ECL) production from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) stimulated with {{purified protein derivative}} (PPD) was examined. The PBMC stimulated with PPD in the absence of IL- 4 failed to produce evident ECL. However, PPD-induced eosinophil chemotactic activity (ECA) production was markedly enhanced in a dose-dependent manner by pretreatment of PBMC with IL- 4. The most potent enhancement was induced by IL- 4 at a concentration of 30 U in tuberculin-sensitive PBMC. Short-term pretreatment (30 min to 3 h) was sufficient for the enhancement, whereas longer-term treatment was less effective. Eosinophil chemotactic lymphokine was found to be a CD 4 + T cell-derived factor with an isoelectric point of approximately pH 7. 0 and without heparin affinity, unlike chemokines such as RANTES and eotaxin. The effect of IL- 4 on the production of other cytokines, such as interferon (IFN) -γ, IL- 5, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was also examined. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells produced all these cytokines when they were treated with PPD, {{even in the absence of}} IL- 4. When PBMC were pretreated with IL- 4, interestingly not only IFNy but also IL- 5 production was suppressed by pretreatment with IL- 4, although ECL production was enhanced by the pretreatment. In the case of RANTES and GM-CSF, significant amounts of these cytokines were produced, even without antigenic stimulation, and IL- 4 pretreatment did not result in an enhancement of their production. It is thus suggested that IL- 4, existing in <b>allergic</b> <b>lesions,</b> plays a crucial role in eosinophil accumulation mediated by the T cell-derived ECL...|$|R
40|$|Gastrointestinal {{food allergy}} {{is caused by}} the {{development}} of allergic inflammation in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract. The mechanisms of this inflammation are immunogflobulin E (IgE) -mediated (oral allergic syndrome, immediate gastrointestinal hypersensitivity), non-IgE-mediated (protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, protein-induced enteropathy, protein-induced allergic proctocolitis) and mixed IgE- and non-IgE-mediated reactions (eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastritis and eosinophilic gastroenteritis). Gastrointestinal manifestations of food allergy are also combined with symptoms of atopic diseases, more often with atopic dermatitis, urticaria and angioedema. Clinical manifestations of <b>allergic</b> <b>lesions</b> of the gastrointestinal tract are different and non-specific. Common signs of gastrointestinal allergy include: vomiting (occurs from a few minutes to 4 – 6 hours after eating); сolic (immediately or several hours after eating); constipation; diarrhea; refusal of food (from a specific product or complete refusal to eat); abdominal pain; flatulence, the presence of mucus and eosinophils in the stool; poor appetite; headache.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the incidence and causes of skin {{reactions to the}} synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who received prophylactic/therapeutic subcutaneous fondaparinux treatment for more than 7 days were prospectively examined for cutaneous adverse effects between September 1, 2008, and April 30, 2009. When indicated, other procedures, such as skin biopsy, allergy testing, and clinical/laboratory assessment for thrombosis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 231 patients were enrolled. No patient developed typical delayed type IV hypersensitivity (DTH) erythematous skin lesions. However, one female patient experienced abdominal pruritus at sites of injection. Histology revealed a mild lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, confirming a DTH reaction. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, as another possible underlying pathomechanism for cutaneous lesions, was ruled out clinically and serologically. Hence, the overall incidence of fondaparinux-induced <b>allergic</b> skin <b>lesions</b> was 0. 4 % (95 % confidence interval, 0. 01 %- 2. 4 %). No cross-allergies were observed in patients with DTH reaction to heparins. CONCLUSION: Fondaparinux has a low allergenic potential. The incidence of allergic cutaneous DTH reactions is almost 20 times lower compared to that with commonly used heparins. These results, together with the known low prevalence of secondary thrombotic events or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia during fondaparinux therapy, suggest that in selected patients fondaparinux might substantially improve patient care, therapeutic safety, and cost-effectiveness of anticoagulant therapy.

Biphasic tissue eosinophilia peaking at 6 and 24 hr was observed in the skin lesions in Bordetella pertussis vaccine (Bp) -treated animals. In contrast, only the early phase of tissue eosinophilia was observed in Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) -treated animals. Although less eosinophil chemotactic activity was detected in 24 -hr-old skin extract of FCA-treated animals (FCA-extract), evident activity was recovered in the concanavalin A eluate (Con A-eluate) when FCA-extract was fractionated by Con A Sepharose. The chemotactic factor in Con A-eluate of FCA-extract was confirmed to be the T cell-derived eosinophil chemotactic factor, termed Delayed ECF-a, which has been isolated from <b>allergic</b> skin <b>lesions</b> by immunoadsorption. Another factor from the same skin lesions, Delayed ECF-b (which is a serum-derived one), was not detected in the FCA-extract. When eosinophils were mixed or pretreated with Con A-effluent of FCA-extract, the treated cells failed to be attracted by Delayed ECF-a, while the response to Delayed ECF-b was not affected, indicating that the inhibition was selective for Delayed ECF-a but not for Delayed ECF-b, and the eosinophil chemotactic inhibitory factor (ECIF) acts on eosinophils directly.

40|$|Mast cells play a {{key role}} in {{allergic}} reaction and disorders through the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI) which is primarily activated by IgE and antigen complex. In humans, mast cells express two types of FcεRI on the cell surface, tetrameric αβγ 2 and trimeric αγ 2, whereas in mice, the tetrameric αβγ 2 type is exclusively expressed. In human <b>allergic</b> inflammation <b>lesions,</b> mast cells increase in number and preferentially express the αβγ 2 type FcεRI. By contrast, in the lesion of non-allergic inflammation, mast cells mainly express the αγ 2 type. Since the β chain amplifies the expression and signaling of FcεRI, mast cell effector functions and allergic reaction in vivo are enhanced in the presence of the β chain. In contrast, a truncated β chain-isoform (βT) inhibits FcεRI surface expression. The human FcεRIβ gene contains seven exons and a repressor element located in the forth intron, through which FcεRIβ transcription is repressed in the presence of GM-CSF. Regarding the additional signal regulatory function of the β chain, the β chain ITAM has dual (positive and negative) functions in the regulation of the mast cell activation. Namely, the FcεRIβ chain ITAM enhances the mast cell activation signal triggered by a low-intensity (weak) stimulation whereas it suppresses the signal triggered by high-intensity (strong) stimulation. In an oxazolone-induced mouse CHS model, IgE-mediated mast cell activation is required and the β chain ITAM is crucially involved. Adenosine receptor, one of the GPCRs, triggers a synergistic degranulation response with FcεRI in mast cells, for which the β chain ITAM critically plays positive role, possibly reflecting the in vivo allergic response. These regulatory functions of the FcεRIβ ITAM finely tune FcεRI-induced mast cell activation depending on the stimulation strength, enabling the FcεRIβ chain to become a potential molecular target for the development of new strategies for therapeutic interventions for allergies...|$|R
40|$|Allergic skin {{reactions}} of the delayed type may be conveniently considered to involve two distinct processes: first, induction of the sensitized state, and second, elicitation of the allergic reaction in the sensitized individual. With regard to the induction of sensitization, it is generally believed that low molecular weight substances (haptens) can function effectively in this respect if they combine in vivo with tissue constituents, presumably proteins. This belief, which had long been reasonably maintained {{on the basis of}} analogy with the conditions required for the production of antisera by haptens, achieved a high degree of plausibility {{as a result of the}} systematic studies of Landsteiner and Jacobs (1, 2). The question as to whether hapten combination with protein is involved in the second process, namely, elicitation of the reaction, has received little attention. In many studies of the elicitation process, haptens which are homologous in structure to the hapten used for inducing sensitization often have produced widely divergent reactions: some homologues have elicited skin lesions, while other have not (3 - 5). This diversity of responses has been interpreted quite consistently in terms of specificity arising from the configurational conformity of the elicifing compound to the sensitizing hapten, little attention being paid to other factors that might modify the responses. However, from a consideration of these earlier studies, it appeared possible that, in addition to configurational features, at least one other factor [...] namely, combination of the eliciting hapten with protein [...] might be involved in accounting for the diverse responses sometimes obtained in eliciting reactions with haptens which are structurally similar to the substance used for inducing sensitization. Accordingly, we have sought to determine with a group of 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl compounds whether combination with protein is important in determining the effectiveness of haptens in producing delayed <b>allergic</b> skin <b>lesions</b> in sensitized guinea pigs and men...|$|R
40|$|Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} is a T cell-mediated immune response, which in its relapsing chronic form is of high socioeconomic impact. The phosphoglycoprotein osteopontin (OPN) has chemotactic and Th 1 cytokine functions and in various models {{is essential for}} robust T cell-mediated immunity. Here we demonstrate that OPN is abundantly expressed by both effector T cells and keratinocytes in <b>allergic</b> {{contact dermatitis}} <b>lesions.</b> T cells from nickel-allergic donors secrete high levels of OPN following antigen-specific stimulation. OPN may substitute for missing IFN-γ secretion in T effector cells because low IFN-γ-producing T cell clones secrete high levels of OPN, and OPN down-modulates their interleukin- 4 expression. Furthermore, interferon-γ from T effector cells augments OPN in allergic contact dermatitis by inducing OPN in keratinocytes, which in turn polarizes dendritic cells and attracts inflammatory cells. In the murine contact hypersensitivity (CHS) model for allergic contact dermatitis, OPN is strongly induced in antigen-specific proliferating T cells, and OPN null mice display a reduced chronic CHS inflammatory response due to a decreased influx of effector T cells. Importantly, because of its function for chronic allergic contact dermatitis, OPN {{may well be a}} therapeutic target, because anti-OPN antibody treatment in part suppresses established chronic CHS...|$|R

Cow’s milk proteins, citrus fruits, chocolate, strawberry were the most frequent causes of food allergies. Gastrointestinal symptoms in allergy manifested by pain and dyspeptic syndrome (nausea, heartburn), altered bowel elimination. 28 % of patients hadn’t abdominalgia.

Animals with dormant focal experimental <b>allergic</b> encephalomyelitis (EAE) <b>lesions</b> were challenged intravenously with a replication-deficient adenovirus vector carrying interleukin (IL) - 1 β cDNA (AdIL- 1 β). Aggravation of inflammation and demyelination within the focal EAE lesion was observed after AdIL- 1 β injection with associated changes in tissue structure detected by diffusion and magnetization transfer imaging. Postgadolinium-DTPA T 1 -weighted images revealed contrast enhancement in the ipsilateral meninges, indicating breakdown of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and increased left/right regional cerebral blood volume ratio was also observed after AdIL- 1 β injection. To determine the role of IFN-β on reactivation of the EAE lesion, rats were treated with therapeutic doses of IFN-β and focal EAE lesions showed significantly reduced reactivation in response to systemic AdIL- 1 β injection. In conclusion, these findings indicate a central role for peripheral IL- 1 β expression in the mechanism of MS lesion reactivation and that the therapeutic effects of IFN-β may, at least in part, reflect suppression {{of the effects of}} peripheral inflammation on MS lesion pathogenesis. © 2013 ISCBFM All rights reserved...|$|R

We have developed a sensitive detection method, called two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in situ hybridization, which enabled us to detect the HTLV-I proviral DNA in paraffin-embedded spinal cord tissue sections from HAM/TSP patients. HTLV-I proviral DNA was detected only in the nucleus of lymphocytes that had infiltrated into the spinal cord. However, no proviral DNA was amplified in any neuronal cells, including neurons and glial cells. This indicates that the demyelination of the spinal cord by HTLV-I as a result of viral infection of oligodendrocytes or neuronal cells is unlikely.

Results: Among 3009 patients, 495 (16. 5 %) had lip lesions ranging from 4 years to 85 years {{with a mean age of}} 39. 7 years. There were 309 (62. 4 %) males and 185 (31. 9 %) females. Lower lip was the most affected region (54. 1 %) followed by the corner of the mouth (30. 9 %) and upper lip (11. 7 %). In 3. 2 % of the cases, both the lips were involved. Of the 495 lip lesions, the most common were Potentially Malignant Disorders (PMDs) (37. 4 %), herpes labialis (33. 7 %), mucocele (6. 7 %), angular cheilitis (6. 1 %), and <b>allergic</b> and immunologic <b>lesions</b> (5. 7 %). Conclusion: Lip lesions may act as an indicator for the presence of an underlying systemic disease. PMDs and infections were the most common lip lesions in the present study...|$|R
40|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20 century, echosonography has been used in many medical specialties. In 1992 and 1993 highfrequencies echosonography was used in the {{examination}} of irritant and <b>allergic</b> skin <b>lesions</b> in order to examine the effects of different therapeuthical agents on the skin lesions [1 - 4]. Hoffmann used highfrequencies echosonography in the examination of healing of skin lesions [3]. By their incidence skin tumors are the largest group of newly discovered tumors, and their usual location is on the face [5 - 7]. By clinical examination it is not possible to precisely determine the depth of tumor border; therefore, the radically performed surgical excision is the only correct surgical treatment. The aim of this study was to estimate the results of preoperatively performed high frequencies echosonography in order to reduce the number of incorrectly performed surgical excisions of skin tumors. The group was composed of 40 patients with 45 tumors, who first underwent echosonographic diagnostic procedure (20 MHz, Hadsund electronic, Hadsund Technology, Denmark) and then surgical excision; patients in control group (45 patients with 45 tumors) were only subjected to surgical excision. Excised tumors were then pathohistologically analyzed, and measurements of tumor depth progression were performed. Margins of pathohistological specimen were controlled for the presence of tumor cells. Results of measurements of tumor depth obtained by echosonography and pathohistological measurements were compared. By Jate's modification of c 2 test results regarding correct and incorrect surgical excision in patients and control group were compared. By linear regression analysis results of tumor depth obtained by echosonographic and pathohistologic examinations were compared. Hypoechogen zone echosonographic results were used like criteria for tumor expansion. Results of tumor depth measurements are presented in Table 1. Linear regression analysis showed (R = 0. 64) that echosonographic examination gave objective pictures of tumor depth. Six specimens were excluded from this examination, and only the presence of tumor cells on specimen margins were analyzed. All tumors in patients were excised radically; in control group tumor cells were present on pathohistological specimens margins of six cases. In comparison p = 0. 5016 was a not significant value. Success of 100 % of specimens correctly excised in operated patients is the success which is very close to success of Moh's micrographie surgery (by Fleming only 1 % of tumor relapse in a five-year follow-up period) [8]. Result of 13. 33 % of incorrect excision in control group is close to results obtained by Leshin and al [9]. Result of p = 0. 05016 is not statistically significant, but is very close to statistically significant values. This might require future examinations in a larger group of patients. Results of R = 0. 64 correlate with results obtained by Hoffmann [3], because they show that high-frequencies ultrasound examination gives an objective picture of skin tumors depth. Results of this examination show that preoperative high frequencies ultrasound examination can determine the progression of tumor depth, and give to surgeon data which can help him to perform correct surgical excisions...|$|R
