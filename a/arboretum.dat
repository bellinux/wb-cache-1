5|$|Construction on the Commonwealth nursery and Westbourne Woods <b>arboretum</b> {{was started}} in 1914, and a {{temporary}} camp was built near the brickworks to accommodate the workers. Thomas Charles Weston was Officer-in-Charge (Afforestation Branch) in the years 1913 to 1926, and later became Director of City Planting and the Superintendent of Parks and Gardens. Weston was responsible for testing and selecting plant species at the <b>arboretum</b> for their suitability to Canberra's environment; from 1913 through to 1924 Weston oversaw the propagation {{of more than two}} million trees which were then planted in the Canberra area. Most of the original Westbourne Woods <b>arboretum</b> is now leased to the Royal Canberra Golf Club, with the remainder forming part of Weston Park. The Yarralumla nursery is still active, albeit on a smaller scale and functioning as a retail nursery selling both wholesale and direct to the public.|$|E

Although the seeds at the Waimea <b>Arboretum</b> germinated and grew for a while, no plants survived beyond the stage of seedling development.
