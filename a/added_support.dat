5|$|The {{game was}} the first to be {{released}} under the Octane Games brand. It received average reviews from critics upon release, with IGN's Gord Goble writing that his main issue with the game was that it was very short and lacked any lasting appeal.

5|$|HDMI 1.0 and 1.1 are {{restricted}} to transmitting only certain video formats, defined in EIA/CEA-861-B and in the HDMI Specification itself. HDMI 1.2 and all later versions allow any arbitrary resolution and frame rate (within the bandwidth limit); any formats that are {{not supported by the}} HDMI Specification (i.e. no standardized timings defined) may be implemented as a vendor-specific format. Although successive versions of the HDMI Specification continue to add support for additional formats (such as 4K resolutions), the <b>added</b> <b>support</b> is to establish standardized timings to ensure interoperability between products, not to establish what formats are and aren't permitted, and video formats do not require explicit support from the HDMI Specification in order to be displayed.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, the English {{scientist}} George Ernest Shelley {{used the}} spelling Necrospa in a book, thereby creating a junior synonym; however, he attributed {{the name to}} zoologist Philip Sclater. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway suggested that the Rodrigues starling should belong in the same genus as the hoopoe starling, Fregilupus, due to the similarity of the species. More subfossils found in 1974 <b>added</b> <b>support</b> to {{the claim that the}} Rodrigues bird was a distinct genus of starling. The stouter bill is mainly what warrants generic separation from Fregilupus. In 2014, the British palaeontologist Julian P. Hume described a new extinct species, the Mauritius starling (Cryptopsar ischyrhynchus), based on subfossils from Mauritius. It was shown to be closer to the Rodrigues starling than to the hoopoe starling, due to the features of its skull, sternum and humerus. Until then, the Rodrigues starling was the only Mascarene passerine bird named from fossil material.|$|E
