5|$|After independence, the All India Women's Conference {{continued}} to operate and in 1954 the Indian Communist Party formed its own women's wing {{known as the}} National Federation of Indian Women. However, feminist <b>agendas</b> <b>and</b> movements became less active right after India's 1947 independence, as the nationalist agendas on nation building took precedence over feminist issues.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} have disagreed with parts of Watson's proposal, {{arguing that the}} four staple crops were already widely disseminated before that period, and that Islamic irrigation built on rather than replacing the Roman irrigation network in Spain. Against this, the historian Paolo Squatriti, reviewing Watson's paper 40 years on, noted that it had proven useful to many different historical <b>agendas,</b> <b>and</b> had held up surprisingly well {{in the face of}} new findings in archaeology and archaeobotany.|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis Czech {{media and}} public {{euroscepticism}} examines frames of public euroscepticism in Czech media <b>agenda</b> <b>and</b> public <b>agenda.</b> The thesis is framed in agenda- setting and framing theory which explains processes of shifting themes between public <b>agenda,</b> media <b>agenda</b> <b>and</b> political <b>agenda.</b> Plethora of studies set in agenda-setting and framing theory has proved correlations between media <b>agenda</b> <b>and</b> public <b>agenda.</b> The goal of this diploma thesis is to examine what is the correlation between Czech media <b>agenda</b> <b>and</b> public <b>agenda</b> {{in terms of public}} euroscepticism, which eurosceptic frames are brought in public agenda by media <b>agenda</b> <b>and</b> how pervasive those frames are. For the comparison of agendas is used the typology of public euroscepticism by Catharine Sørensen which consists of economic euroscepticism, euroscepticism based on sovereignty, democratic euroscepticism and social euroscepticism. Author postulates positive correlation between media <b>agenda</b> <b>and</b> public <b>agenda</b> <b>and</b> presence of pervasive frames in media agenda. The first part describes the theoretical frame of the thesis, the agenda-setting and framing theory. The second chapter presents existing research about euroscepticism on EU and Czech level.

In a formal {{imperial}} relationship, the core can appoint and dismiss peripheral elites, obviate any external <b>agenda</b> or policies, <b>and</b> directly control the internal <b>agenda</b> <b>and</b> policies. In an informal imperial relationship, the core has influence but not control over appointing and dismissing peripheral elites, direct control over the external <b>agenda</b> <b>and</b> policies, and influence over the internal <b>agenda</b> <b>and</b> policies. Finally, in a hegemonic relationship, the core has no control over appointing or dismissing peripheral elites, control over the external agenda, influence over external policies, and no control over the internal agenda or policies.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Heathen organisations {{emerged in the}} United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Iceland, largely {{independently}} from each other. This has been partly attributed to the wider growth of the modern Pagan movement during the 1960s and 1970s, {{as well as the}} development of the New Age milieu, both of which encouraged the establishment of new religious movements intent on reviving pre-Christian belief systems. Further Heathen groups then emerged in the 1990s and 2000s, many of which distanced themselves from overtly political <b>agendas</b> <b>and</b> placed a stronger emphasis on historical authenticity than their 1960s and 1970s forebears.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{is also the}} most visible state officer and is the center of political attention in the Commonwealth. The official host of the state when dignitaries visit, the governor frequently delivers addresses at various dedications and ceremonies, and appears on national television with the winner of the annual Kentucky Derby. The state constitution requires the governor to address the legislature periodically regarding the state of the Commonwealth. This address, traditionally given annually, is often targeted directly at the state's citizens as much as, or more so than, the legislature. The governor can use the address to extol the accomplishments of his or her term and lay out a specific plan for the upcoming legislative session; the contents of the address often shape the agenda of the session. The state's media outlets devote significant coverage to the governor's actions, and many strong governors have used the media to win support for their <b>agendas</b> <b>and</b> criticize political enemies.|$|E

25|$|Economics per se, as {{a social}} science, is {{independent}} of the political acts of any government or other decision-making organization, however, many policymakers or individuals holding highly ranked positions that can influence other people's lives are known for arbitrarily using a plethora of economic concepts and rhetoric as vehicles to legitimize <b>agendas</b> <b>and</b> value systems, and do not limit their remarks to matters relevant to their responsibilities. The close relation of economic theory and practice with politics is a focus of contention that may shade or distort the most unpretentious original tenets of economics, and is often confused with specific social <b>agendas</b> <b>and</b> value systems.|$|E

He shared Ahmad Khan's belief that Muslims should first build up their social capital through advanced education before engaging in politics. Agha Khan boldly told the British Raj that Muslims must be considered a separate nation within India. Even after he resigned as president of the AIML in 1912, he still exerted major influence on its policies and agendas. in 1913 Mohammed Ali Jinnah joined the Muslim league.|$|E
25|$|Spaatz and Harris {{once again}} protested at {{the use of}} their {{services}} for tactical support, each with their own <b>agendas</b> <b>and</b> targets. Harris wanted to continue his policy of area bombing industrial cities, Spaatz wanted to attack the oil plants. Both believed their strategies would cripple the German war effort. Spaatz threatened to resign if {{at least one of the}} strategic bomber forces was not given over to a campaign against oil targets. He argued bombing tactical targets in France was pointless, as rail yards could be easily repaired. Moreover, he wanted to provoke the Luftwaffe in battle. Spaatz thought that attacking rail targets would not achieve this, but striking at Petroleum would. Eisenhower relented, and Spaatz succeeded in moving the USAAF 15AF to Romanian targets. Up until this point, only sporadic attacks had been made against oil targets.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} no {{prohibition}} {{in the area of}} the didgeridoo's origin, such restrictions have been applied by other Indigenous communities. The didgeridoo was introduced to the Kimberleys almost a century ago but it is only in the last decade that Aboriginal men have shown adverse reactions to women playing the instrument and prohibitions are especially evident in the South East of Australia. The belief that women are prohibited from playing is widespread among non-Aboriginal people and is also common among Aboriginal communities in Southern Australia; some ethnomusicologists believe that the dissemination of the Taboo belief and other misconceptions is a result of commercial <b>agendas</b> <b>and</b> marketing. Tourists generally rely on shop employees for information when purchasing a didgeridoo. Additionally, the majority of commercial didgeridoo recordings available are distributed by multinational recording companies and feature non-Aboriginals playing a New Age style of music with liner notes promoting the instrument's spirituality which misleads consumers about the didgeridoo's secular role in traditional Aboriginal culture.|$|E

25|$|The L.A. riots {{contributed to}} the {{creation}} of new ethnic <b>agendas</b> <b>and</b> organization. A week after the riots, in the largest Asian-American protest ever held in a city, about 30,000 mostly Korean and Korean American marchers walked the streets of L.A. Koreatown, calling for peace and denouncing police violence. This cultural movement was devoted to the protection of Koreans' political rights, ethnic heritage, and political representation. It created a new form of leaders within the community, in which second generation children spoke on behalf of the community. Korean Americans saw a shift in occupation goals, from storeowners to political leaders. Such political voice aided Korean Americans in receiving governmental aid in the reconstruction of their damaged neighborhoods. Countless community and advocacy groups have been established to further fuel Korean political representation and understanding. They experienced firsthand the severity of such isolation, as they were forced to endure the physical and psychological aftermath. The representative voice that was created remains present in South Central Los Angeles, as such events as the riots {{contributed to the}} shaping of identities, perceptions and political and social representation.|$|E
25|$|In 1803, the Boheman affair {{caused a}} severe {{conflict}} between Gustav IV Adolf and the ducal couple. The mystic Karl Adolf Boheman (1764–1831) {{had been introduced}} to the couple by Count Magnus Stenbock in 1793 and gained great influence by promising to reveal scientific secrets about the occult. Boheman inducted them into a secret society Yellow Rose (society) in 1801, where both sexes where accepted as members, and to which the Counts and Countesses Ruuth and Brahe {{as well as the}} mother of the queen were introduced. Boheman was arrested upon an attempt to recruit the monarch, who accused him of revolutionary <b>agendas</b> <b>and</b> expelled him. The ducal couple were exposed in an informal investigation by the monarch, and the duchess was questioned {{in the presence of the}} royal council. In 1808, he was again chief commander during Gustav IV Adolf's stay in Finland. He is presumed to have been, if not involved, so aware of the plans to depose Gustav IV Adolf in 1809. He kept passive during the Coup of 1809, and accepted the post of regent by the victorious party after having assured himself of the deposed monarch was not in mortal danger. He was initially not willing to accept the crown, however, out of consideration of the former king's son.|$|E
25|$|Peña Nieto was sworn-in as President of Mexico on 1 December 2012 at {{the federal}} {{congress}} and later flew to a military parade to formally {{take control of the}} armed forces. During his inauguration speech at the National Palace, Peña Nieto proposed his <b>agendas</b> <b>and</b> reforms for the new administration. Before and after the inauguration, protesters rioted outside of the National Palace and clashed with Federal Police forces, vandalizing hotel structures and setting fires in downtown Mexico City. More than 90 protesters were arrested and several were injured. Mayor Marcelo Ebrard blamed anarchist groups for the violence. However, there is evidence that agents of provocation worked with the police, paid 300 Mexican pesos (about US$20) for their acts of vandalism, according to media reports. Photos show the vandals waiting in groups behind police lines prior to the violence. Previous protests had been entirely peaceful, but on this occasion, in apparent response to violence, the police fired rubber bullets. In contrast to the protests, there were no public celebrations of the new presidency. The day after his inauguration, Peña Nieto announced the Pact for Mexico, an agreement that he had struck with the leaders of two other major parties about the government's goals for the next few years.|$|E

25|$|Since the Cabinet Crisis of 1964, {{there has}} been {{disagreement}} {{on the extent to}} which rivalries within the MCP in the early 1960s reflected generational and ideological tensions between Dr Banda and his younger ministers or regional divisions. Following the release of the Chisiza brothers and Chipembere in October 1960, the influence of northerners appeared to grow, reaching a peak in September 1961 when Yatuta Chisiza was appointed the party's Administrative Secretary alongside his brother, Dunduzu, the Secretary General; Chiume was Publicity Secretary; Orton Chirwa was Legal Adviser; and Rose Chibambo, the only woman on the party's National Executive, was Chairman of the Woman's League. This apparent northern dominance, masked divisions and politicians born in the north pursued various personal and ideological <b>agendas</b> <b>and</b> did not act as a regional bloc. After the Lancaster House conference made it clear that independence would be achieved, MCP became a more divided party. The focus moved away from achieving independence towards the allocation of resources between ministries and regions. Resentment of the hold that better-educated northerners had on scarce jobs was used by Banda to assert his authority by playing ministers off against one another, but there is no evidence of him adopting a pro-Chewa, anti-northern stance before the 1964 crisis. None of the ministers who resigning in 1964 drew attention to regional distinctions, but Banda's allies from the Central Region accused northern politician in general and Chiume in particular of favouritism, and voiced Chewa resentment against senior civil servants from the north, many of whom had demonstrated in favour of the former ministers. Rose Chibambo came in for particularly violent abuse, probably because of anti-female as well as anti-northern prejudice.|$|E

Clements also made Wetherby executive secretary of the State Democratic Central Committee, which allowed Wetherby to make many important political contacts.|$|E
