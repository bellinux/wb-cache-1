5|$|In the game's primary single-player mode, titled GH Live {{within the}} game, the player completes songs while {{experiencing}} full-motion video {{taken from the}} first-person perspective of a band's lead guitarist. The video includes shots of the audience and the band members. As the player performs the songs, the audience responds positively to good performances when few mistakes are made. If the player makes several mistakes in a row, the <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> become critical and start to jeer at the performer. To win back the crowd, the player can either match more notes correctly, or can use collected Hero Power to rapidly regain their interest. Hero Power, replacing Star Power from previous Guitar Hero games, is collected by correctly playing marked series of notes on the track; Hero Power can be accumulated, marked as on-screen guitar picks next to the track, to be used at later times. The player can release Hero Power for a limited time by either tilting the guitar controller upward or hitting a special button on the controller.|$|E

25|$|Although {{romance novels}} are {{translated}} into over 90 languages, {{the majority of}} authors of these works are from Great Britain, the United States, Canada or, to a lesser extent, Australia. In France, where over 12 million romance novels are sold each year, all are translations. and some publishing companies in Germany refuse to allow their romance authors {{to use their own}} names, fearing that the German <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> not buy a romance novel that does not have an Anglo-American pseudonym.|$|E
25|$|He {{extensively}} discusses playwright Molière's work, {{and uses}} the play Le Misanthrope to exemplify a comedy in which the audience derives immoral pleasure. In the play, the main character, Alceste, is good and honest in his relationships with men and made to look ridiculous, whereas Philinte, a deceiver and manipulator, is shown as superior. Rousseau considers this play to be a work of genius, but it is, of course, morally backwards. He reasons that even if comedy writers write a play that is morally acceptable, the <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> not find it funny. Therefore, theatres are of little use.|$|E
500|$|Jeanie {{practices}} {{for her own}} audition ("No Other Love"), and Larry tells her that the <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> accept her if she's [...] "a real kid" [...] like Juliet, but reject her if she's a [...] "phony" [...] ("The Big Black Giant"). Larry desires a romance with Jeannie, but fears the larger and stronger Bob.|$|E
5000|$|The play {{received}} favorable reviews. Mark Allan called it, 'triumphant, inspirational, a winner.' [...] Katherine Gibson found it, 'funny, poignant, authentic' [...] Sharon Pollock said, 'actors and <b>audiences</b> <b>will</b> {{love these}} roles.' ...|$|R

500|$|Music {{critics have}} applied several {{different}} genres to Quique, including dream pop, ambient techno, Intelligent Dance Music, and shoegaze. Glenn Swan of AllMusic described the album's mixture of genres as [...] "a sort of electronic hybrid that had listeners simultaneously scratching their heads", while Jess Harvell of Pitchfork {{stated that the}} <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> [...] "hear {{the beginnings of a}} still-thriving genre that remains slippery and unnamed, purely electronic music with a strange, tangy rock aftertaste." ...|$|E
500|$|We {{feel it is}} {{appropriate}} to continue with the transmission of these episodes as this is not a one-off programme but an established and long-running series. The <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> be familiar with the character of Newt and this plotline, which has been both trailed and promoted, has been developing over a number of weeks.

500|$|Salegy is an {{electrified}} {{version of}} the traditional antsa musical style that Tandroy singer Mama Sana used to perform at Betsimisaraka and Tsimihety rituals. [...] In addition to their commonalities in tempo, vocal style, and tendency toward minor keys (which some attribute to an Arab influence, and which stands {{in contrast to the}} major key dominance of Highland music), the salegy shares the antsa's structure in that it always features a middle section called the folaka ("broken") which is primarily instrumental—voice serves only to urge on more energetic dancing—and during which the vocalists (and the <b>audience)</b> <b>will</b> launch into intricate polyrhythmic hand-clapping to the beat of the music.|$|E

50|$|Because {{dead air}} does not attract listeners, the station tries to fill its {{broadcast}} day with sound. <b>Audiences</b> <b>will</b> only tolerate {{a certain number}} of commercials before tuning away.

500|$|This {{would cause}} {{problems}} for the studio, Universal and partner MGM. [...] "The studio is just back from the holiday and is regrouping based on the news, and has no cohesive game plan at the moment," [...] said Kevin Misher, Universal's President of Production. Misher added that, [...] "It {{was one of those}} moments when you sit down and think, 'Can Clarice be looked upon as James Bond for instance? A character who is replaceable?' Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling, and the <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> not accept anyone else?" [...] Foster said in December 1999 that the characterization of Starling in Hannibal had [...] "negative attributes" [...] and [...] "betrayed" [...] the original character.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, The Devil Inside, a low-budget {{found footage}} horror film {{following}} in the steps of Cloverfield, opened the weekend after New Year's Day. Critics, for whom {{it had not been}} screened, reviewed it harshly if and when they did see it, and audiences reacted angrily to the film's abrupt ending, which directed them to a website for more information. Yet, as Cargill notes, its success was proof that even on that low-potential weekend, a disengaged <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> [...] "throw money at a terrible movie if it looks like it's good." [...] The film's opening weekend take of $33.7 million ranks in the top ten for January. The Devil Inside went on to make over $50 million domestically and almost that much abroad to break $100 million in total receipts.|$|E
500|$|The {{season finale}} {{of the second}} season {{introduced}} the parallel universe to viewers. Fringes producers debated over {{how much of this}} universe to depict in the third season, but ultimately decided that showing the doppelgangers would [...] "fit more into our own character’s lives and show different aspects of their personalities". As a result, Fringe began its third season by alternating between episodes, with each depicting one universe. The Fox network was initially resistant to this design, as executives were [...] "really concerned that if the episodes didn't have [...] Walter or Peter in them, it wouldn’t feel like our show anymore." [...] Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman explained that the series had to constantly evolve, [...] "otherwise we’ll get bored, the cast will get bored, the <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> get bored"; after the first several episodes of the season, Fox agreed it was a positive change.|$|E

50|$|Despite being {{a native}} of Japan, she has lived abroad {{most of her life}} and {{considers}} herself an outsider to Japan. This enabled her to bring a different perspective to theatre in Japan by challenging how plays are produced there and what Japanese <b>audiences</b> <b>will</b> respond to.|$|R
500|$|Adamson also {{desired to}} make the film larger in scale; [...] "I've gained {{confidence}} having gone through the first. This time, I {{was able to go}} larger [...] scale, with more extras and bigger battle scenes." [...] Inspired by a passage in the novel where Reepicheep says he would like to attack the castle, a new battle scene in which Peter and Caspian make an attempted raid on Miraz's castle was created. Adamson felt the imagery of mythological Greek creatures storming a castle was highly original. Markus and McFeely used the sequence to illustrate Peter and Caspian's conflict and Edmund's maturity, in an effort to tighten the script by using action as drama. Adamson preferred subtlety to the drama scenes, asking his young male actors not to perform angrily. Adamson copied Alfred Hitchcock by [...] "tell people {{at the end of the}} scene, 'Now just give me something where you're not thinking about anything.' By using it in context, the <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> read an emotion into it." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, Warner Bros. took pitches from {{comic book}} writers, screenwriters and {{directors}} {{on how to}} successfully restart the Superman film series. Comic book writers Grant Morrison, Mark Waid, Geoff Johns and Brad Meltzer were among those who pitched their ideas for a reboot. [...] "I told them, it’s not that bad. Just treat Superman Returns as the Ang Lee Hulk," [...] Morrison said. [...] "The Incredible Hulk has proven the <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> forgive you and let you redo the franchise," [...] said Waid. Morrison's idea was similar to his work on All-Star Superman, while Waid's was akin to [...] Mark Millar, teaming with director Matthew Vaughn, also planned an epic eight-hour Superman trilogy, each installment released a year apart, similar to The Lord of the Rings. Millar compared it to the Godfather trilogy, in which it would chronicle the entire life of Superman, {{from the early days}} of Krypton to the finale where Superman loses his powers as the Sun starts to go supernova.|$|E
500|$|It Takes a Church has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Tom Conroy of Media Life enjoyed the premiere episode, {{arguing that it}} may even attract a secular audience: [...] "Even secular viewers will be curious to see which one Angela picks, and they’ll get a glimpse into a subculture that is largely invisible on TV. Members of that subculture, on the other hand, will watch It Takes a Church and say, 'Amen!'". Contrastly, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times called the series [...] "utterly frivolous," [...] and called into question the [...] "state of America's spiritual health" [...] after watching an episode. Genzlinger also argued that the show was a {{not much more than}} a [...] "desperate" [...] effort to find something the conservative Christian <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> watch. Carrie Grosvenor of About Entertainment added that viewers should [...] "pass" [...] on the series, calling GSN's The American Bible Challenge a better [...] "solid game format." ...|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} {{for the film}} by English language critics has been mixed. DVD Talk gave the film a mixed review, writing [...] "Sayonara Jupiter will intrigue and frustrate fans of Japanese fantasy cinema in equal measure, while mainstream American <b>audiences</b> <b>will</b> find it insufferably dull and unoriginal." ...|$|R

500|$|RCA Records CEO Peter Edge {{spoke to}} Billboard on which two {{specific}} groups {{they want the}} album to appeal to, [...] "By the time the album is available, Usher's collective <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> {{have had a chance}} to really sample a number of songs from the album [...] the end result will be an Usher album that appeals to his earliest fans, and people who may have never listened to or owned an Usher album before." [...] Prior to the album's release, Usher was put under the management of Grace Miguel—whom he is in a relationship with—replacing Randy Phillips, who managed Usher for a short period after he split with his mother, Jonnetta Patton for a second time, in 2008. The cover art and track listing for both the standard and deluxe edition of the album were revealed on May 3, 2012. On June 4, 2012, 30 second snippets of each track were leaked on the internet.|$|E
500|$|In October 2007, drinks' {{industry}} {{body the}} Portman Group made an official complaint to communications regulator Ofcom about {{a scene in}} Holby City which depicted two medics drinking five shots of tequila following a stressful day at work. The body's chief executive David Poley claimed that in failing to show {{the negative consequences of}} this action, the series was presenting a [...] "highly irresponsible portrayal of excessive and rapid drinking". Ofcom received a total of eight complaints about the incident. In response to the accusation that [...] "We would expect the BBC to take greater care with the portrayal of alcohol in programmes", the BBC released a statement tying the complaint closely to the alcoholism storyline being played out with Kyla at the time, explaining that: [...] "Holby City {{is in the middle of}} a storyline in which a key character (Kyla) has spiralling problems in her personal and professional life because of alcohol — a storyline that fully and realistically depicts the negative impact of alcohol dependency in the workplace. Kyla has now been seen to seek help for alcoholism and the <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> see how she fares on the road to recovery." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman {{decided to}} {{alternate}} the episodes between the prime and parallel universes because they [...] "thought {{that the best}} way to really thoroughly tell these stories was to dive into them wholeheartedly... the journey that our heroine is on and then come back over here because [...] is embedded in our team, we have point of view characters in both universes and it seemed to us the perfect opportunity to really explore in a really thorough fulsome way the alternate universe". Wyman elaborated that he felt fans [...] "would really appreciate a mythology in two places", and showing both universes [...] "just presented itself in such a natural organic way to evolution in our storytelling". Fox however was initially worried about the premise's sustainability, and that an episode without Peter or Walter [...] "wouldn't feel like our show anymore," [...] to which Pinkner responded that [...] "not unlike a show like Lost, Fringe has to constantly evolve, to move and grow and go forward, otherwise we'll get bored, the cast will get bored, the <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> get bored". After the first three episodes, both Fox and Warner Bros. became more favorable to the storyline.|$|E
