5|$|The World Health Organization, the European Union {{and other}} {{regional}} bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies {{in order to}} reduce the harm of alcoholism. Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of <b>alcohol</b> <b>abuse.</b> Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, evidence based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of <b>alcohol</b> <b>abuse</b> have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent <b>alcohol</b> <b>abuse</b> amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the study is the {{influence}} of <b>alcohol</b> <b>abusing</b> father on the clinical picture of PTSD patient. The father plays an important identification role in the psychological development of his son. Therefore it is to be expected that an <b>alcohol</b> <b>abusing</b> father will become a (negative) role model for his son and that he will also later on in stressful situations try to reduce the anxiety and depression by consuming larger quantities of alcoholic drinks. The aim {{of the study is}} to find out whether there are differences in PTSD clinical picture in patients whose fathers <b>abused</b> <b>alcohol</b> and in those whose fathers did not have such problem. The participating patients were from the Psychiatric hospital »Sveti Ivan«. Mississippi and Watson scales were applied, as well as a questionnaire named »Early traumas« from which the variable »alcohol abuse of the father« was selected. The analysis shows that the participants who in their family histories had fathers who <b>abused</b> <b>alcohol</b> developed a milder clinical picture of PTSD, i. e. they reactions to the stress later on were less sensitive compared to the control group of participants whose fathers did not <b>abuse</b> <b>alcohol</b> and whose clinical pictures of the disorder were more severe...|$|R

5|$|Tertiary sexual {{dysfunction}} results from {{psychological and social}} factors. Reduced libido, desire, or experience of arousal {{could be due to}} psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships. Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused. Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and drug and <b>alcohol</b> <b>abuse</b> may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties. Drug and <b>alcohol</b> <b>abuse</b> increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and social functioning.|$|E

40|$|The type {{of parental}} child-rearing {{practices}} used {{by parents and}} guardians substantially influence children’s self-esteem and consequently their decision to engage in <b>alcohol</b> use, its <b>abuse.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the role of self-esteem and parenting patterns on <b>alcohol</b> use and <b>abuse</b> among adolescents. Three hundred and sixteen boys and girls in Senior High Schools completed self-report questionnaires assessing self-esteem, parenting patterns and <b>alcohol</b> use and <b>abuse.</b> The results showed that while girls reported lesser self-esteem than boys, boys reported higher levels of <b>alcohol</b> use and <b>abuse</b> than girls. Also, authoritative parenting pattern had a positive effect on self-esteem and a negative effect on alcohol use. On the other hand, authoritarian and permissive parenting patterns had negative effects on self-esteem and positive effects on alcohol use, with slight variations. These results provide valuable information regarding strategies aimed at fostering parent-child relationship and rapport with the ultimate aim of bolstering the self-esteem of adolescents to subsequently eschew insalubrious behaviour, particularly <b>alcohol</b> use and <b>abuse...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} how nurses experience to handle the alcohol issues among young people and how they can identify young people’s <b>alcohol</b> problems, <b>abuse</b> and dependence. Empirical articles were searched in the databases Cinahl, Medline(Pubmed) and Discovery and resulted in the inclusion of 14 scientific articles. The results showed that nurses find it difficult to raise the issues of alcohol with young people, this partly because they feel that they have too little knowledge and that it is an emotional issue to raise. There is help instruments available that nursing staff can use to raise this issues and to identify <b>alcohol</b> problems, <b>abuse</b> and dependence. The usual instruments for use on adolescents are AUDIT, CRAFT and POSIT. It is important that health workers have knowledge about this, so they can identify <b>alcohol</b> problems, <b>abuse</b> or dependence among adolescents in the early stage. The conclusion which is found is that <b>alcohol</b> problems, <b>abuse</b> and dependence among adolescents at early ages have increased considerably. Health professionals have lack of knowledge about being able to deal with issues of alcohol. There is little knowledge about how the instruments on alcohol-related issues for adolescents have to be used, which leads that questions not addressed...|$|R
