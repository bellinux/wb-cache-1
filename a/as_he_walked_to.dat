500|$|Despite being widely tipped as contenders, the Heat {{got off to}} a {{tentative}} 9–8 start. The Heat managed to go on to compile a 21–1 record, however, and were jostling with the Boston Celtics and Chicago Bulls for pole position in the Eastern Conference as mid-season approached. Miami finished the regular season with 58 wins and faced Philadelphia {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. Miami won the series in five games, and also prevailed in five games in the semi-finals against Boston. In the Conference Finals against Chicago, Bosh was particularly instrumental, averaging 23.2 points in the 4–1 series win. He was slow off the blocks in the Finals against Dallas, shooting below [...]300 in the first two games, but scored the winning shot in Game 3 to give Miami a 2–1 lead. That was the last game Miami won, as Dallas won the next three to win its first ever championship. Bosh was seen sobbing <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the locker room following the loss.|$|E

One month after his divorce was finalized, Gacy abducted and murdered an 18-year-old youth named Darrell Sampson. Sampson was last seen alive in Chicago on April 6, 1976. Five weeks later, on the afternoon of May 14, a 15-year-old named Randall Reffett disappeared while walking home from Senn High School; the youth was gagged with a cloth, causing him to die of asphyxiation.

During the afternoon of 15 October Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, gave an impromptu speech to the protesters {{on the topic of}} anonymity after he was challenged by police for wearing a mask <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the protest.

While Handy waited, he dictated a statement in which he accused Heney of attacking him, and he also dictated his will. Heney immediately surrendered at the court house and his bond was set at $6,000. Three friends immediately posted his bail. A hearing was set for Saturday.|$|E

All his clothing was later found in Haarmann's apartment. Less than three weeks later, on 26 May, a 17-year-old travelling salesman from the town of Kassel named Fritz Wittig, whom Haarmann would later state he had killed upon the insistence of Grans as he had worn a [...] "good new suit" [...] Grans coveted, was dismembered and discarded in the Leine River. The same day Wittig {{is believed to have}} been killed, Haarmann killed his youngest known victim, 10-year-old Friedrich Abeling, who disappeared while truant from school. His murder would be followed less than two weeks later by that of 16-year-old Friedrich Koch, who was approached by Haarmann on 5 June <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> college.

2500|$|On 21 April 2001, a mugging {{and attack}} upon 76-year-old white World War II veteran Walter Chamberlain by three Asian youths was amongst {{the first major}} provocations {{which led to the}} riots. Mr. Chamberlain was {{approached}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> his home after watching a local amateur rugby league match. He was mugged and badly beaten, receiving fractured bones in the face amongst other injuries. His battered face appeared {{on the front of the}} Manchester Evening News, and the story spread to all the major national newspapers. In the Mail on Sunday, his story was told under the headline 'Whites beware'. In the Mirror, his face appeared under the headline [...] "Beaten for being white: OAP, 76, attacked in Asian no-go area". Media pundits began to speculate on the apparent transformation of young Asian males - from the stereotype of hard-working boys, who respected their parents, to the new stereotype of angry, violent thugs. An Asian male (a Mr. Fokrul Islam) was ultimately charged for the crime of racially aggravated grievous bodily harm on 1 October 2001, some time after the riots. Walter Chamberlain and his family in an attempt to try to calm tensions in the borough stated at the time that the mugging was just that, and not at all racially motivated."It was a violent assault on an elderly man", said Mr. Chamberlain's son Steven. [...] "As a family we don't think it was a race issue at all." [...] Since this story was attributed to fuelling further hatred in the local communities race crimes against all sections of society are no longer reported as such for fear of further trouble.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2010–11 Ashes series Johnson {{took more}} wickets {{than any other}} Australian with 15 (36.93) even though he played only 4 Tests. In the First Test at the Gabba he was hit for 0/170 in the match and was so out of form that he was dropped. Returning for the Third Test at the WACA he hit 62, took 6/38 and 4/44 was {{instrumental}} in Australia's 267 run victory. However, his wayward bowling returned and Johnson {{became the subject of}} a chanting by the Barmy Army whenever he bowled; He bowls to the left, He bowls to the right, That Mitchell Johnson, His bowling is shite. [...] In the Fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground England fans sang this <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the crease and he made a first ball duck as England won by an innings to retain the Ashes. In July 2012, he admitted the jibes he’d received from England fans during successive Ashes series defeats had dented his confidence. [...] He has also, however, considered the choice to target him as a compliment. Ever since his overall poor Ashes series, Mitchell Johnson claimed a spot in the South African series. He did not fare well in that series either, without picking up a 4 or 5 wicket haul, leaking many runs, and not contributing heavily with the bat. He picked up a toe injury, escaping being dropped. He did find himself, later that year, in the 3rd Test at Perth against South Africa. He bowled exquisitely, picking up the prized wicket of Hashim Amla and finishing with a four wicket haul. He also gained a place, in the Test series against Sri Lanka. Although he didn't play in the 1st Test, he was the man of the match in the 2nd claiming match figures of 6–79 as well as playing a brilliant 92 not out. He also played in the 3rd Test as an all-rounder due to Shane Watson's injury. He had a poor first innings with the ball and bat. With figures of 1–118 and only making 13, despite a fierce spell to Lahiru Thirimanne which, unfortunately, didn't claim any wickets. He did bowl well in the second innings, claiming the prized wicket of Dilshan and Thirimanne.|$|E

2500|$|The first live {{performance}} of the song was made at the premiere of the artist's Politia Live Clubbing concert series in Thessaloniki on 14 May. For the {{live performance}} of the song it is played with smoke and bright green and pink lights in the background as Rouvas sings {{standing in front of}} a microphone stand while playing his black Gibson Les Paul. Rouvas was also short-listed as a performer at the MAD Video Music Awards 2010, where he led the nominations for a solo artist with six, and performed a similar routine as the third act of the night. For the performance, all of the lights in the stadium were dimmed to bring lights from the cellular phones of audience members into prominence, while an animation of the new [...] "Sakis" [...] logo, also exhibited on the single cover, ran on the black video wall as Rouvas appeared on stage wearing tight black pants, unlaced boots, and a torn black T-shirt designed by Dimitris Kaïdantzis, while playing an excerpt of an unrelated guitar riff <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> his platform on the side of the stage. The music subsequently began with Rouvas singing in front of a stand and playing guitar simultaneously, while below him a grid exuded gold lighting and smoke and behind him an outtake of the then-unreleased music video, featuring a close-up of Rouvas singing in front of a black background, as well as additional imagery, was played on the video wall. In the final chorus, the platform raised Rouvas several feet in the air above the audience, while confetti was distributed all over the stadium. The performance was reviewed favourably, with MAD TV deeming it [...] "explosive," [...] while it was [...] "unique" [...] to the awards' standard, where upbeat, choreographed performances are usually favoured by artists. While most negative criticism of the performance centred on the selection of the song itself being wrong for the event, especially as Rouvas is known for his elebarate stage shows and choreography, the innovative camera work and stage presentation was widely acclaimed, with Madata calling it an [...] "impressive extreme." [...] The song will also be part of Rouvas' set list on his forthcoming tour following Politeia.|$|E
