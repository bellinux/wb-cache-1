40|$|Flip chip is an {{electronic}} packaging {{technology that is}} becoming more popular in first level electronic packaging {{as the need for}} high density electrical interconnects becomes more relevant. The parallel nature of flip chip and harsh thermomechanical treatment introduces stress to the microchip and substrate. This is primarily caused by the application of high forces and mismatch in the thermal coefficient of expansion among the materials in the system. Other noise factors like misalignment, parallelism mismatch, warpage, pillar height variation, and temperature variation can weaken the bonding process. Unlike wire bonding, {{there is a lack of}} tools available for quality assessment of the flip chip process in-situ locally at the interconnect sites. There are however some existing wire bonding sensor tools which can be modified to be useful for optimization of flip chip equipment and processes. A 4 x 3 mm CMOS chip is designed to record XYZ force and temperature profiles in-situ on a 2 -dimensional surface during a simulated flip chip process. This was done as a low risk proof of concept to evaluate if the wire bonding tools can be adapted for a flip chip application. 95 μm square Al bond pads arranged in a square 8 x 8 array with 400 μm pitch have embedded piezoresistive force sensors and local top metal resistive temperature detectors. The chip is packaged with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>wire</b> bonds to deliver power and capture signals while operating under a bond head. Ball bumps 73 μm in diameter are deposited onto the sensor pads using 4 N Au wire. Z sensors are calibrated using a modified automatic wire bonder. A normalized sensitivity of SN= 1. 39 mV/V/N is measured. Temperature sensors are calibrated at 50 °C using Kelvin probing yielding 186. 94 Ω. A 3 x 3 mm Si wafer with Al patterning is used as a dummy pressure plate for touchdowns on the sensor chip with an experimental setup advanced process bond head. Force and temperature signals are recorded locally at each bump. 80 N force with 200 °C temperature ramps ups are applied. Evidence of tilt and thermal expansion are detected. The prototype is demonstrated successfully and identified the most stressful stage of the bonding which occurred during thermal transients, i. e. during the short lived overshoot period of maximum stress in the force signals observed immediately after the application of heat to the system...|$|E
40|$|Torque {{control of}} {{individual}} incisors using pre-adjusted edgewise (PAE) appliance {{is a common}} clinical challenge. In order to overcome the inherent disadvantages of the PAE appliance in efficiency of torque delivery, the use of light <b>wire</b> <b>auxiliaries</b> for early control of {{the roots of the}} instanding tooth in the alignment stage itself has been described using the case report. A case of an 18 -year-old female patient with the chief complaint of irregularly placed upper front teeth has been described. Treatment was carried out by extraction of four premolars and the resolution of crowding and the incorporation of light <b>wire</b> <b>auxiliaries</b> with PAE appliance has been described. For the alignment of 42 which was lingually displaced, and to bring it into the arch by bodily displacement rather than labial tipping, a LIght <b>wire</b> <b>auxiliary</b> (Mollenhauer aligning auxiliary) was used in conjunction with PAE appliance. The biomechanical advantages of the procedure have been highlighted. The use of light <b>wire</b> <b>auxiliaries</b> have definite advantages and hence should be a part of our armamentarium to handle such cases. Light <b>wire</b> <b>auxiliaries</b> offer us a biomechanically superior and economical alternative to apply torque forces on incisors...|$|R

Some of the first users of AF cab signal systems include the Washington Metro and Bay Area Rapid Transit. More recently digital systems have become preferred, transmitting speed information to trains using datagrams instead of simple codes. The French TVM makes use of the running rails to transmit the digital signalling information while the German LZB system makes use of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>wires</b> strung down {{the centre of the}} track to continually transmit the signalling information.|$|R

50|$|Lashing {{has been}} used as a means of {{installing}} communications cables since the process was developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories in the late 1940s. This process typically involves lashing one or more copper telephone cable, co-ax cable TV cable or fibre optic cable to a pre-installed steel messenger wire using a steel lashing wire and a device called a 'spinner' or 'lasher'. It is used to attach these types of cables to road-side utility pole lines and this type of installation is not covered by the term OPAC. OPAC specifically refers to fibre optic cables attached to overhead power lines where the host conductor is part of the overhead electricity system.Lashed communication cables on the ground <b>wire</b> or an <b>auxiliary</b> grounded <b>wire</b> were installed until the mid-1980s at several powerlines of former EVS (now EnBW) in Baden-Württemberg, Germany and are still used on some lines.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{main idea}} of the paper is {{investigation}} of the maximum values of current and angle errors of the current transformers {{and the nature of}} their changes in steady-state and transient power system conditions in which the possible output of errors beyond the normalized range of values, as well as a comparison of the degree of change of current and angle errors of the current transformers for power supply <b>auxiliary</b> <b>wiring</b> devices of relaying protection in these conditions. Research methods. The authors used the method of simulation and visualization of the current transformer operation of computers, intended for supply of secondary circuits of relay protection devices in steady and transient conditions of supply power system and different operating modes. The obtained results. The authors defined the percentage of the maximum current and angular error of the primary current transformation to the secondary circuit of the current transformer which are caused by the presence of the magnetizing current and resistive losses in the magnetic system of the test current transformer; their comparison is performed and conclusions are drawn regarding their changes in steady-state and transient conditions, in particular, the fact is established that the current errors in emergency conditions vary to a much greater extent than the angular and under certain conditions may extend beyond the value of the normalized state standards. Scientific novelty. The authors developed the modern method of investigation of current and angle errors of the current transformers for auxiliary supply of relay protection devices based on the use of a computer model of an ideal current transformer with a linear no hysteresis B-H curve, which has similar characteristics and primary and secondary circuit parameters to study the real transformer current. Practical significance. The results can be used in researching the optimum operating current transformers conditions and the development of new principles of perform measurement and logical circuits of relaying protection, in particular, it was concluded that in order to provide the more sensitive and selective protection we can use the devices based on the principle of their action to respond only to the phase relation between the currents of the current transformers and connections that have to be rebuilt only from the angle measurement errors...|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of RCDs that need a power supply, a {{dangerous}} condition can arise if the neutral wire is broken or switched off {{on the supply side}} of the RCD, while the corresponding live wire remains uninterrupted. The tripping circuit needs power to work and does not trip when the power supply fails. Connected equipment will not work without a neutral, but the RCD cannot protect people from contact with the energized wire. For this reason circuit breakers must be installed in a way that ensures that the neutral wire cannot be switched off unless the live wire is also switched off at the same time. Where there is a requirement for switching off the neutral wire, two-pole breakers (or four-pole for 3-phase) must be used. To provide some protection with an interrupted neutral, some RCDs and RCBOs are equipped with an <b>auxiliary</b> connection <b>wire</b> that must be connected to the earth busbar of the distribution board. This either enables the device to detect the missing neutral of the supply, causing the device to trip, or provides an alternative supply path for the tripping circuitry, enabling it to continue to function normally {{in the absence of the}} supply neutral.|$|R
