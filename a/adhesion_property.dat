Methods and Results: Thirteen dairy propionibacteria strains and two control strains, Lactobacillus acidophilus MJLA 1 and Bifidobacterium lactis BDBB 2, were tested for adhesion to C 2 BBe 1. Electron microscopic observations demonstrated that the control strains, L. acidophilus MJLA 1 and B. lactis BDBB 2, had similar adhesive ability to C 2 BBe 1 as had been previously shown to Caco- 2.

The adhesion and chemical properties of hybrids were investigated as a function of epoxy group contents. The hybrids were prepared from 3 -metacrloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTS) and 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTS) and diphenylsilanediol. The transparent hybrids were obtained after curing by UV irradiation. The adhesion properties of the hybrids were estimated by the maximum load to resist in a scratch test. The <b>adhesion</b> <b>property</b> of the hybrids increased with addition of GPTS and the highest adhesion was obtained from the hybrid with 5 - 10 mol % of GPTS.

Results show that, depending on the graphene-substrate adhesion, number of graphene layers and substrate stiffness, graphene exhibits two distinct types of morphology: I) graphene remains bonded to the substrate and corrugates to an amplitude up to that of the substrate surface patterns; II) graphene debonds from the substrate and remains flat on top of the substrate surface patterns. The sharp transition between these two types of graphene morphology occurs at a critical adhesion between the graphene and the compliant substrate material.

The second objective was to identify reliable indicators to predict shear <b>adhesion</b> <b>properties</b> by building the correlation between physical <b>properties</b> and <b>adhesion</b> <b>properties</b> of enzymatically modified soy protein-based adhesives (ESP). ESP was prepared with three independent variables (X 1 : trypsin concentration, X 2 : incubation time, and X 3 : glutaraldehyde (GA) concentration as a crosslinker) using a response surface methodology (RSM) called a central composite design (CCD). The important physical properties of viscosity (Y 1), tacky force (Y 2), and water resistance (Y 3) were measured and investigated their relationship with adhesion strength. Viscosity, tacky force and water resistance showed solid correlation with adhesion strength of ESP and they were used to predict adhesion performance of soy protein modification system in this work. In addition, we studied the correlation between film strength and adhesion strength of another soy protein system. Because cohesion among protein molecules plays an important role in film and bonding mechanisms, we assumed that the film strength may be a reliable indicator to predict the adhesion strength of soy protein. The mechanical properties of the film and <b>adhesion</b> <b>properties</b> of soy protein on cherry wood were measured in terms of different concentrations of plasticizer (poly (propylene glycol) bis (2 -aminopropyl ether) (H 2 N–PPG–NH 2)). The results found out the low correlation between film and adhesion strength of soy protein in the presence of the plasticizer. We believe this might be caused by different curing conditions for film and adhesive applications of soy protein. Curing conditions greatly affect the thermal and curing behavior as well as mechanical properties of final materials. Thus, similar or comparable curing conditions should be required to obtain the information on the relationship between film and adhesion strength of soy protein...|$|R

The range of calcium carbonate loaded was from 10 to 50 parts per hundred parts of rubber (phr). Coumarone-indene resin was used as the tackifier and its concentration was fixed at 80 phr. Toluene was chosen as the solvent throughout the investigation. The substrates (PET film/paper) were coated with the adhesive using a SHEEN hand coater at a coating thickness of 60 µm. Viscosity of the adhesive was measured by a HAAKE Rotary Viscometer whereas loop tack and peel strength were determined by a Llyod Adhesion Tester operating at 30 cm/min. Results show that viscosity of ENR-based adhesives increases gradually with increase in calcium carbonate loading due to the concentration effect of the filler. However, for loop tack and peel strength, it passes through a maximum at 30 phr calcium carbonate, an observation which is attributed to the optimum wettability of adhesive on the substrate at this adhesive composition.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ultra high {{molecular}} weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fiber has advanced mechanical properties and excellent physical properties that include high effectiveness for cosmic radiation shielding, which is valuable for outer space missions. Unfortunately, poor interface in UHMWPE fiber–polymer composites hinders the structural integrity and safety, and restricts its effectiveness for the radiation shielding. In this study, {{we focus on the}} improvement of the <b>adhesion</b> <b>property</b> between the UHMWPE fiber and resin matrix by developing a nano-epoxy matrix through making a modification on the matrix with reactive graphitic nanofibers (r-GNFs). The interfacial adhesion between UHMWPE fiber and the nano-epoxy matrix with low concentrations of r-GNFs (0. 15, 0. 30, and 0. 50 wt%) is characterized by analyzing load–displacement curves from microbond tests. Study results show that crack initiation force, debonding force, debonding energy, and friction energy from the microbond tests increase considerably, due to the effective improvement of interfacial <b>adhesion</b> <b>property</b> by the nano-epoxy matrix.
