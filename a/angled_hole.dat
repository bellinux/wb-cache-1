50|$|Some {{individuals}} have complained about persistent soreness {{in the area}} spanning a year or more, migration, {{and in some cases}} even rejection. While some of these issues can arise from improper aftercare and careless handling, many times they are the result of improper placement or poorly suited anatomy. Depending on the size and thickness of one's antihelix in this area, the increased curvature of a CBR (as opposed to a curved barbell) can put undue strain on the healing fistula which can prolong soreness and promote migration. Rejection will only occur in the most extreme of circumstances, usually because of poor placement (too shallow or oddly <b>angled</b> <b>hole)</b> or extreme trauma inflicted on the piercing especially during healing. In general, a person with decent health and proper hygiene is unlikely to experience any complications or pain outside of the normal healing process.|$|E

40|$|High turbine inlet {{temperature}} becomes necessary for increasing thermal efficiency of modern gas turbines. To prevent failure of turbine components, advance cooling technologies have been applied to different portions of turbine blades. The detailed film cooling effectiveness distributions along a rotor blade has been studied under combined effects of upstream trailing edge unsteady wake with coolant ejection by the pressure sensitive paint (PSP). The experiment is conducted in a low speed wind tunnel with a five blade linear cascade and exit Reynolds number is 370, 000. The density ratios for both blade and trailing edge coolant ejection range from 1. 5 to 2. 0. Blade blowing ratios are 0. 5 and 1. 0 on suction surface and 1. 0 and 2. 0 on pressure surface. Trailing edge jet blowing ratio and Strouhal number are 1. 0 and 0. 12, respectively. Results show the unsteady wake reduces overall effectiveness. However, the unsteady wake with trailing edge coolant ejection enhances overall effectiveness. Results also show that the overall effectiveness increases by using heavier coolant for ejection and blade film cooling. Leading edge film cooling has been investigated using PSP. There are two test models: seven and three-row of film holes for simulating vane and blade, respectively. Four film holes? configurations are used for both models: radial <b>angle</b> cylindrical <b>holes,</b> compound <b>angle</b> cylindrical <b>holes,</b> radial <b>angle</b> shaped <b>holes,</b> and compound <b>angle</b> shaped <b>holes.</b> Density ratios are 1. 0 to 2. 0 while blowing ratios are 0. 5 to 1. 5. Experiments were conducted in a low speed wind tunnel with Reynolds number 100, 900. The turbulence intensity near test model is about 7 %. The results show the shaped holes have overall higher effectiveness than cylindrical holes for both designs. As increasing density ratio, density effect on shaped holes becomes evident. Radial <b>angle</b> <b>holes</b> perform better than compound <b>angle</b> <b>holes</b> as increasing blowing and density ratios. Increasing density ratio generally increases overall effectiveness for all configurations and blowing ratios. One exception occurs for compound angle and radial <b>angle</b> shaped <b>hole</b> of three-row design at lower blowing ratio.

Advanced cooling technologies must be applied to cool the blades, so they can withstand the extreme conditions. Film cooling is widely used in modern high temperature and high pressure blades as an active cooling scheme. In this study, the film cooling effectiveness in different regions of gas turbine blades was investigated with various film hole/slot configurations and mainstream flow conditions. The study consisted of four parts: 1) effect of upstream wake on blade surface film cooling, 2) effect of upstream vortex on platform purge flow cooling, 3) influence of <b>hole</b> shape and <b>angle</b> on leading edge film cooling and 4) slot film cooling on trailing edge. Pressure sensitive paint (PSP) technique was used to get the conduction-free film cooling effectiveness distribution. For the blade surface film cooling, the effectiveness from axial shaped <b>holes</b> and compound <b>angle</b> shaped <b>holes</b> were examined. Results showed that the compound <b>angle</b> shaped <b>holes</b> offer better film effectiveness than the axial shaped holes. The upstream stationary wakes have detrimental effect on film effectiveness in certain wake rod phase positions. For platform purge flow cooling, the stator-rotor gap was simulated by a typical labyrinth-like seal. Delta wings were used to generate vortex and modeled the passage vortex generated by the upstream vanes. Results showed that the upstream vortex reduces the film cooling effectiveness on the platform. For the leading edge film cooling, two film cooling designs, each with four film cooling hole configurations, were investigated. Results showed that the shaped holes provide higher film cooling effectiveness than the cylindrical holes at higher average blowing ratios. In the same range of average blowing ratio, the radial <b>angle</b> <b>holes</b> produce better effectiveness than the compound <b>angle</b> <b>holes.</b> The seven-row design results in much higher effectiveness than the three-row design.

Additional four film-hole geometries with backward injection were tested by reversing the injection direction from forward to backward to the mainstream.

40|$|AbstractTo design more {{efficient}} film cooling geometries for gas turbines, non-intrusive {{measurements of the}} flow temperature, velocity and derived quantities like the turbulent heat flux are needed in well-defined, generic flow configurations. With this aim we have applied thermographic particle image velocimetry (thermographic PIV) to investigate the flow emanating from angled and trenched cooling holes in a closed-loop optically-accessible wind tunnel facility. BAM:Eu 2 + thermographic phosphor particles were seeded into the flow as a tracer. A pulsed high-speed UV laser was used to excite the particles and the luminescence was detected using two high-speed cameras to determine the temperature field by a two-colour ratiometric approach. The velocity field was measured using ordinary high-speed PIV. The simultaneously measured fields were sampled {{at a rate of}} 6 kHz in a vertical plane through the centreline of the symmetrical single-row cooling holes. The flowrate and temperature of the cooling air and heated main flow were chosen to achieve density and momentum flux ratios of 1. 6 and 8 respectively. For these conditions the average and RMS temperature fields show that for ordinary <b>angled</b> <b>holes</b> the jet is detached from the surface. In contrast, the trenched geometry leads to a cooling film attached to the surface. However, time-resolved image sequences show instances where hot air breaks through the cooling film and almost reaches the surface. Similar image sequences for the <b>angled</b> <b>holes</b> show that the detached coolant jet becomes unstable downstream and pockets of cold air are ejected into the main flow. This intermittency may in part explain the observation that the measured turbulent heat flux is oriented towards the cold core, but deviates {{from the direction of the}} mean temperature gradient, thereby contradicting the simple gradient diffusion hypothesis commonly used in RANS simulations...|$|R

As a result, {{there is a strong}} need to study in detail and discover essential features of turbine platform and blade tip film cooling under engine representative flow and rotating conditions. This dissertation deals with the specific heat transfer and aerodynamics problematic inherent to high pressure (HP) turbine sections. Major efficiency improvement has been achieved by introducing a completely new endwall contouring technology which decreases the strength of the secondary flow vortices. Efficiency measurements show for the contoured rotor a maximum efficiency of 89. 9 % compared to the reference non-contoured case of nt-s = 88. 86 %. This is an efficiency increase of nt-s = 1. 04 %. The new method of endwall contouring not only has improved the turbine aerodynamic efficiency but it also has substantially improved the film cooling effectiveness of the contoured endwall. The film cooling experiments were carried out using pressure sensitive paint (PSP) measurement technique. Measurements were conducted for three coolant-to-mainstream mass flow ratios (MFR) of 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 5 %. Film cooling data is also obtained for three rotational speeds, 3000 rpm (reference condition), 2550 rpm and 2400 rpm and they are compared with non-contoured endwall data. For 3000 rpm two more coolant to mainstream mass flow ratio of 0. 75 % and 1. 25 % are performed to have a better view of how film cooling effectiveness is changing. Comparing experimental results of the film cooling effectiveness investigations of the contoured case with the reference non-contoured case, clearly shows the improving effect of contouring on film cooling effectiveness for all cases investigated in this report. Four different blade tip ejection configurations were utilized to determine the impact of the hole arrangements on the film cooling effectiveness: plane tip with tip hole cooling, squealer tip with tip hole cooling, plane tip with pressure-side-edge compound <b>angle</b> <b>hole</b> cooling and squealer tip with pressure-side-edge compound <b>angle</b> <b>hole</b> cooling.

This "anti-vortex" film cooling concept proposes the addition of two branched holes from each primary hole {{in order to produce}} a vorticity counter to the detrimental kidney vortices from the main jet. These vortices typically entrain hot freestream gas and are associated with jet separation from the turbine blade surface.

Army Corps of Engineers installed a low-head weir in Los Alamos Canyon near the White Rock ''Y. '' However, the occurrence of fractured basalt at the surface and ponding of runoff behind the weir enhance the possibility of downward migration of contaminants. Therefore, three boreholes were drilled on the south bank of the channel by LANL to provide a means of monitoring the impact of the Cerro Grande fire and of the weir on water quality beneath the canyon. The boreholes and associated instrumentation are referred to as the Los Alamos Weir Site (LAWS). The three boreholes include a vertical <b>hole</b> and two <b>angled</b> <b>holes</b> (one at approximately 45 {sup o} and one at approximately 30 {sup o}). Since the basalt is highly fractured, the holes would not stay open. Plans called for inserting flexible liners into all holes. However, using liners in such unstable ground was problematic and, in the <b>angled</b> <b>holes,</b> required deployment through scalloped or perforated polyvinyl chloride (PVC) shield. The vertical hole (LAWS- 01), drilled to a total depth of 281. 5 ft below ground surface (bgs), was completed as a 278 -ft deep monitoring well with four screens: one targeting shallow perched water encountered at 80 ft, two in what may correspond to the upper perched zone at regional groundwater characterization well R- 9 i (1 / 4 mi. to the west), and one in what may correspond to the lower perched zone at R- 9 i. A Water FLUTe{trademark} system deployed in the well isolates the screened intervals; associated transducers and sampling ports permit monitoring head and water quality in the screened intervals. The second hole (LAWS- 02), drilled at an angle of 43 {sup o} from horizontal, is 156 ft long and bottoms at a depth of 106 ft bgs. The shallow perched water seen at LAWS- 01 (at 80 ft) was not encountered. A scalloped PVC shield was installed to keep the hole open while permitting flexible liners to contact the borehole wall. It was initially instrumented with a color-reactive liner to locate water-producing fractures. That was later replaced by an absorbent liner to collect water from the vadose zone. The third hole (LAWS- 03), drilled at an angle of 34 {sup o} from horizontal, initially had a length of 136 ft and bottomed at a depth of 76 ft bgs. However, the PVC shield rotated during installation such that scallops were at the top and rock debris repeatedly fell in, preventing liner insertion. While pulling the scalloped PVC to replace it with a perforated PVC shield that did not require orientation, the scalloped PVC broke and only 85 ft was recovered. The hole was blocked at that position and could not be drilled out with the equipment available. Thus, LAWS- 03 was completed at a length of 85 ft and a depth of 40 ft bgs. An absorbent liner was installed at the outset in preparation for the 2002 summer monsoon season. The entire monitoring site is enclosed inside a locked, 8 -ft-high chainlink fence for security. The liners used in the angled boreholes carry electrical wire pairs to detect soil-moisture changes. Surface-water data are provided by stream gages above and below the weir site. Depth of ponding behind the weir is provided by a gage installed just behind the structure...|$|R
40|$|We {{measure the}} flux of spherical glass beads {{through a hole}} as a {{systematic}} function of both tilt <b>angle</b> and <b>hole</b> diameter, for two different size beads. The discharge increases with hole diameter {{in accord with the}} Beverloo relation for both horizontal and vertical holes, but in the latter case with a larger small-hole cutoff. For large holes the flux decreases linearly in cosine of the tilt angle, vanishing smoothly somewhat below the angle of repose. For small holes it vanishes abruptly at a smaller angle. The conditions for zero flux are discussed {{in the context of a}} clogging phase diagram of flow state vs tilt angle and ratio of hole to grain size...|$|R
