25|$|The {{nasogastric}} <b>aspirate</b> {{can help}} determine the location of bleeding and thus direct initial diagnostic and treatment plans. Witting found that nasogastric <b>aspirate</b> has sensitivity 42%, specificity 91%, negative predictive value 64%, positive predictive value 92% and overall accuracy of 66% in differentiating upper GI bleeding from bleeding distal to the ligament of Treitz. Thus, in this study a positive <b>aspirate</b> is more helpful than a negative <b>aspirate.</b> In a smaller study, Cuellar found a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 55%, somewhat opposite results from Witting.|$|E

50|$|When <b>aspirated</b> consonants are doubled or geminated, {{the stop}} is held longer and then has an <b>aspirated</b> release. An <b>aspirated</b> affricate {{consists}} of a stop, fricative, and <b>aspirated</b> release. A doubled <b>aspirated</b> affricate has a longer hold in the stop portion and then has a release consisting of the fricative and aspiration.|$|R
50|$|Voiced consonants {{are seldom}} {{actually}} <b>aspirated.</b> Symbols for voiced consonants followed by , such as , typically represent consonants with murmured voiced release (see below).

5000|$|Many Indo-Aryan {{languages}} have <b>aspirated</b> stops.

50|$|<b>Aspirated</b> consonants are {{not always}} {{followed}} by vowels or other voiced sounds.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{a group of}} pathologists and clinicians working under the World Health Organization (WHO) {{modified}} this classification, introducing several new disease categories and eliminating others. Most recently, the WHO has evolved a new classification scheme (2008) which is based more on genetic findings. However, morphology of the cells in the peripheral blood, bone marrow <b>aspirate,</b> and bone marrow biopsy are still the screening tests used to decide which classification is best and which cytogenetic aberrations may be related.|$|E
25|$|Because English stops /p, t, k/ {{primarily}} have aspiration, {{speakers of}} English often hear the Māori nonaspirated stops as English /b, d, g/. However, younger Māori speakers tend to <b>aspirate</b> /p, t, k/ as in English. English speakers {{also tend to}} hear Māori /r/ as English /l/ in certain positions (cf. Japanese r).

25|$|Vomiting in the helmet. This {{can be a}} real {{emergency}} and life-threatening if not handled effectively, as the diver can <b>aspirate</b> the vomit and asphyxiate. Once again, the action is to open the free flow valve, preferably before vomiting, and to inhale as carefully as possible. If there is no free flow valve, as on a full face mask, the purge button should clear the demand valve and oro-nasal mask, and the mask can be rinsed by lifting the bottom edge away from the face to let in some water, before purging again.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Electro-Motive Diesel's {{two-stroke}} engines, the mechanically assisted turbocharger is not specifically a twincharger, as the engine uses the mechanical assistance to charge air only at lower engine speeds and startup. Once above notch # 5, the engine uses true turbocharging. This differs from a turbocharger that uses the compressor section of the turbo-compressor only during starting and, as a two-stroke engines cannot naturally <b>aspirate,</b> and, according to SAE definitions, a two-stroke engine with a mechanically assisted compressor during idle and low throttle is considered naturally aspirated.|$|E
