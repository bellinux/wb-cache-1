5|$|In October 1867, {{an agent}} for Swift & Co. {{negotiated}} a deal with Peru to purchase Catawba and her sister for a million dollars apiece. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, initially indicated that the company could repurchase the pair if it refunded the government's costs to build them, but {{changed his mind and}} said that he had no authority to do that. Congress debated the issue and ultimately decided that they would be <b>appraised</b> by a board of officers and that the highest competitive bid in equal to or in excess of the <b>appraised</b> value would be accepted. The ship was <b>appraised</b> at $375,000 and sold for that amount, possibly after a rigged bid, on 11 April 1868.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to stimulate {{thoughts}} and introduce new prospects to the study of performance appraisal accuracy, especially in the raters’ perspective. It focuses on a relatively understudied aspect of performance appraisal which is raters’ intention towards <b>appraising</b> accurately. In order to understand the application of this aspect, this paper attempts to develop a conceptual framework based on hypotheses of the direct and indirect factors that predict the raters’ intention to <b>appraise</b> accurately. It is hypothesized that the raters’ experience in <b>appraising,</b> raters’ perceived purposes of appraisal, and raters’ perceived information adequacy for <b>appraising</b> will predict the raters’ intention towards <b>appraising</b> accurately by influencing the raters’ attitude towards <b>appraising</b> accurately, raters’ perceived subjective norms towards <b>appraising</b> accurately, and raters’ perceived behavioral control towards <b>appraising</b> accurately...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{describing}} the connotation of agricultural intangible asset and cost method, the technical ideas of <b>appraising</b> by cost method are introduced. The article analyzes the advantages (simple appraisal principle and easy to understand and grasp; overall consideration of various factors related to appraisal result value) and disadvantages (high appraisal cost; difficult to <b>appraise</b> and grasp various appraisal factors) of <b>appraising</b> by cost method. The article also summarizes the precondition of <b>appraising</b> by cost method: it is applicable to <b>appraise</b> the agricultural intangible asset which can be reproduced and afresh developed. Based on the cognition of agricultural intangible asset and the relevant rules of Ministry of Finance on appraisal of intangible asset by using cost method, the model of <b>appraising</b> agricultural intangible asset by cost method is constructed. That is: agricultural intangible asset value = replacement cost of agricultural intangible asset Ã—newness rate + opportunity cost of agricultural intangible asset. Determine and analyze parameters of the model, in order to offer references for appraisers to <b>appraise</b> agricultural intangible asset value more reasonably.

The Chrysler Building was thus the first man-made structure to be taller than , and as one newspaper noted, the tower was also taller than the highest points of five states. The new Chrysler Building, <b>appraised</b> at $14 million, was also exempt from city taxes as per an 1859 law that gave tax exemptions to sites owned by the Cooper Union. Although the city had attempted to repeal the tax exemption, Cooper Union opposed that measure, and because the Chrysler Building retains the tax exemption, it has paid Cooper Union for the use of their land since opening.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{consists}} of two spans, 64.1 feet and 81.10 feet, with a 3.2 feet gap between them. The combined trussed portions of the bridge are 149.1 feet long. The bridge's Town lattice is an unusual design choice, but the later addition of the queen trusses are also unusual, resulting in a unique visual appearance by the bridge's unequal spans. This gives the appearance of kingposts within the queenposts. Since {{the addition of the}} steel I-beam flooring in 1973, the trusses have supported nothing but themselves. The State of Connecticut's lists the bridge as CT 1338 and the May 2012 inspection of the bridge found the deck and superstructure conditions to be satisfactory and condition of the substructure to be fair. The West Cornwall Covered bridge has been <b>appraised</b> as functionally obsolete.|$|E

Around midday Kemal was <b>appraised</b> that the 9th Division was fully involved with the British landings at Cape Helles, and could not support his attack, so at 12:30 he ordered two battalions of the 77th Infantry Regiment (the third battalion was guarding Suvla Bay) to move forward between the 57th and 27th Infantry Regiments. At the same time he ordered his reserve 72nd Infantry Regiment to move further west. Within the next half-hour the 27th and 57th Infantry Regiments started the counter-attack, supported by three batteries of artillery. At 13:00 Kemal met with his corps commander Esat Pasha and convinced him of the need to react in strength to the ANZAC landings. Esat agreed and released the 72nd and 27th Infantry Regiments to Kemal's command. Kemal deployed the four regiments from north to south; 72nd, 57th, 27th and 77th. In total, Turkish strength opposing the landing numbered between ten thousand and twelve thousand men.|$|E

5|$|At {{this time}} {{defendants}} {{were required to}} pay trial expenses, and Cofresí's family was charged 643 pieces of eight, two reales and 12 maravedí. Contemporary documents suggest that Juana Creitoff, {{with little or no}} support from Cofresí's brothers and sisters, was left with the debt. His brothers distanced themselves from the trial and their brother's legacy, and Juan Francisco left Cabo Rojo for Humacao. Ignacio also evidently disassociated himself from Creitoff and her daughter, and one of Ignacio's granddaughters ignored Bernardina and her descendants. Due to Cofresí's squandering of his treasure, his only asset the Spanish government could seize was Carlos. <b>Appraised</b> at 200 pesos, he was sold to Juan Saint Just for 133 pesos. After the auction costs were paid, only 108 pesos and 2 reales were left; the remainder was paid by Félix and Miguel Mattei after they made a deal with the authorities giving them the cargo of the San José y las Animas in return for future accountability. Juana Creitoff died a year later.|$|E
5|$|Beato pioneered {{and refined}} the {{techniques}} of hand-colouring photographs and making panoramas. He may have started hand-colouring photographs {{at the suggestion of}} Wirgman, or he may have seen the hand-coloured photographs made by partners Charles Parker and William Parke Andrew. Whatever the inspiration, Beato's coloured landscapes are delicate and naturalistic and his coloured portraits, more strongly coloured than the landscapes, are <b>appraised</b> as excellent. As well as providing views in colour, Beato worked to represent very large subjects in a way that gave a sense of their vastness. Throughout his career, Beato's work is marked by spectacular panoramas, which he produced by carefully making several contiguous exposures of a scene and then joining the resulting prints together, thereby re-creating the expansive view. The complete version of his panorama of Pehtang comprises seven photographs joined together almost seamlessly for a total length of more than 2 metres (6 1/2ft).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to define, observe and {{evaluate}} <b>appraising</b> of children’s own compositions in music lessons in one Secondary Comprehensive School with children aged 11 to 16 years where the researcher is also a teacher of music in the school. Through an action research framework, teaching strategies are adapted progressively to improve the learning situation that allows pupils to <b>appraise</b> most effectively and purposefully. The findings demonstrate different levels of talk in children about their composing work that represent their developing skills of critical thinking and analysis. From these a typology of levels of <b>appraising</b> is drawn up. The findings suggest that as children engage and empathise with their music compositions affectively, they appear to be able to talk more confidently about their work. The study considers whether, as children make sense of their work, they are able to understand more than their talk reveals. The need for musical vocabulary, the role of the teacher in nurturing <b>appraising</b> of composing work in the classroom and the role of conceptual understanding are other issues which are considered. It is suggested in the findings that as pupils develop their <b>appraising</b> skills to higher levels of performance, they also become effective, reflective practitioners. The research sees both the teacher researcher and the pupils engaging in <b>appraising</b> as reflective practitioners...|$|R
5|$|The Oregon Library was {{designed}} by Chicago architects Pond and Pond. The Ponds {{were members of the}} Eagle's Nest Art Colony, founded by Lorado Taft, and their association with Taft and the colony led them to design the library. Their design was influenced by the colony, and a combination of two architectural styles, Classical Revival and the Arts and Crafts movement. The completed library included a second floor art gallery to which members of Eagle's Nest donated works for a permanent collection. The gallery's collection includes 64 paintings and sculptures as well as a Currier and Ives lithograph collection <b>appraised</b> at US$700,000. The Oregon Public Library was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2003, three years later it was included as a contributing property in a historic district that received the National Register designation.|$|E
5|$|The gallery on {{the second}} floor of the library {{building}} was not formally dedicated until July 4, 1918. That date marked the beginning of the library's permanent collection, which started with additions from members of the Eagle's Nest Colony. Members donated twelve statues, twenty oil paintings, and four portraits to the permanent collection of the art gallery. One of the statues in the collection is a 4-foot (1.2-m) plaster study of The Eternal Indian by Lorado Taft. It was completed in 1908 as he prepared to create the Black Hawk Statue at the original site of the Eagle's Nest Colony. The entire permanent collection consists of 32 paintings and 32 sculptures from Eagle's Nest artists. A citizen left the library a Currier and Ives lithograph collection which contains 46 Currier and Ives lithographs and 14 lithographs by Nathaniel Currier. The two collections have been <b>appraised</b> at over $700,000.|$|E
