5|$|Horizontal frames often {{featured}} in Bacon's 1950s and 1960s paintings. The motif {{may have been}} borrowed from the sculptor Alberto Giacometti, who Bacon greatly <b>admired</b> <b>and</b> often corresponded with. Giacometti had employed the device in The Nose (1947) and The Cage (1950). Bacon's use of frames has suggested imprisonment to many commentators. Writing on their use in Fragment, Zweite mentions that the diagonal lines transform the cross into a guillotine.|$|E

5|$|The World Before the Flood is {{strongly}} influenced by A Bacchanalian Revel Before a Term of Pan (1632–33) by Nicolas Poussin, whom Etty greatly <b>admired</b> <b>and</b> of whose works he had previously made several copies; this painting had been bought by the National Gallery in 1826. Adam and Michael are not visible in the painting. Instead, the viewer sees the scene from Adam's point of view.|$|E
5|$|Although Braille was <b>admired</b> <b>and</b> {{respected}} by his pupils, his writing system was not {{taught at the}} Institute during his lifetime. The successors of Valentin Haüy, {{who had died in}} 1822, showed no interest in altering the established methods of the school, and indeed, they were actively hostile to its use. Dr. Alexandre François-René Pignier, headmaster at the school, was dismissed from his post after he had a history book translated into braille.|$|E
5|$|Between 1950 and 1960, {{research}} and writings by international critics like George R. Collins, Nikolaus Pevsner and Roberto Pane spread a renewed awareness of Gaudí's work, while in his homeland it was <b>admired</b> <b>and</b> promoted by Alexandre Cirici, Juan Eduardo Cirlot and Oriol Bohigas. Gaudí's work has since gained widespread international appreciation, {{such as in}} Japan where notable studies have been published by Kenji Imai and Tokutoshi Torii. International recognition of Gaudí's contributions {{to the field of}} architecture and design culminated in the 1984 listing of Gaudí's key works as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Gaudí's style have subsequently influenced contemporary architects such as Santiago Calatrava and Norman Foster.|$|E

5|$|During his labors {{to sustain}} the {{provisional}} government, Johnson's lack of hearing from his family weighed heavily upon him. The only family member {{with whom he had}} contact was his son Madison ("Matty"), who had joined John Hunt Morgan's cavalry. Johnson <b>admired</b> <b>and</b> respected Morgan, and was pleased that his son had chosen to serve under him. In 1862, he requested by letter that his wife send their fifteen-year-old son Junius to serve in the Confederate Army. Despite Johnson's protestations that he would ensure his son's safety, his wife refused this request.|$|E
5|$|Harding's death {{came as a}} great {{shock to}} the nation. The {{president}} was liked and <b>admired,</b> <b>and</b> the press and public had followed his illness closely, and been reassured by his apparent recovery. Harding was returned to his train in a casket for a journey across the nation followed closely in the newspapers. Nine million people lined the tracks as Harding's body was taken from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., and after services there, home to Marion, Ohio, for burial.|$|E
5|$|Lord Pitfour {{was widely}} <b>admired</b> <b>and</b> often dined with fellow lawyer and biographer James Boswell, who {{declared}} Pitfour {{to be one}} of the greatest Scottish lawyers. This was endorsed by the diarist John Ramsay of Ochtertyre (1736–1814), who remarked that Pitfour was one of a small number of barristers who he found satisfying to hear speak. Pitfour practised law in Edinburgh at the height of the Scottish Enlightenment and was a member of The Poker Club.|$|E

Maciunas <b>admired</b> <b>and</b> promoted her work enthusiastically and gave Ono her U.S. show at his AG Gallery in 1961. He formally invited her to join the Fluxus group, but she declined because she wanted to remain independent. She did, however, collaborate with him, Charlotte Moorman, George Brecht, and the poet Jackson Mac Low, among others associated with the group.|$|E
5|$|Secretary of War Edwin Stanton was an {{able and}} {{hard-working}} man, but {{difficult to deal}} with. Johnson both <b>admired</b> <b>and</b> was exasperated by his War Secretary, who, in combination with General of the Army Grant, worked to undermine the president's Southern policy from within his own administration. Johnson considered firing Stanton, but respected him for his wartime service as secretary. Stanton, for his part, feared allowing Johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign, despite his public disagreements with his president.|$|E
5|$|The Olympics were of {{fundamental}} religious importance, featuring sporting events alongside ritual sacrifices honouring both Zeus (whose famous statue by Phidias {{stood in his}} temple at Olympia) and Pelops, divine hero and mythical king of Olympia. Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King Oenomaus of Pisatis. The winners of the events were <b>admired</b> <b>and</b> immortalised in poems and statues. The Games were held every four years, and this period, known as an Olympiad, was used by Greeks {{as one of their}} units of time measurement. The Games were part of a cycle known as the Panhellenic Games, which included the Pythian Games, the Nemean Games, and the Isthmian Games.|$|E

5|$|Thomas's early poetry {{was noted}} for its verbal density, alliteration, sprung rhythm and {{internal}} rhyme, and he was described by some critics as having {{been influenced by the}} English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. This is attributed to Hopkins, who taught himself Welsh and who used sprung verse, bringing some features of Welsh poetic metre into his work. When Henry Treece wrote to Thomas comparing his style to that of Hopkins, Thomas wrote back denying any such influence. One poet Thomas greatly <b>admired,</b> <b>and</b> who is regarded as an influence, was Thomas Hardy. When Thomas travelled in America, he recited Hardy's work in his readings.|$|E
5|$|Ulysses appears {{larger than}} his fellow sailors, while the Sirens hold out their arms in {{traditional}} dramatic poses. The three Sirens {{are very similar}} in appearance, and Etty's biographer Leonard Robinson believes it likely that Etty painted the same model in three different poses. Robinson considers their classical poses {{to be the result}} of Etty's lifelong attendance at the Academy's Life Classes, where models were always in traditional poses, while former curator of York Art Gallery Richard Green considers their pose a tribute to the Nereids in Rubens's The Disembarkation at Marseilles, a work Etty is known to have <b>admired</b> <b>and</b> of which he made a copy in 1823.|$|E
5|$|In his profession, Coward {{was widely}} <b>admired</b> <b>and</b> loved for his {{generosity}} and kindness {{to those who}} fell on hard times. Stories are told of the unobtrusive {{way in which he}} relieved the needs or paid the debts of old theatrical acquaintances who had no claim on him. From 1934 until 1956, Coward was the president of the Actors Orphanage, which was supported by the theatrical industry. In that capacity, he befriended the young Peter Collinson, who was in the care of the orphanage. He became Collinson's godfather and helped him to get started in show business. When Collinson was a successful director, he invited Coward {{to play a role in}} The Italian Job. Graham Payn also played a small role in the film.|$|E

5|$|Nevinson's boasting and exaggerated claims {{concerning}} his war experiences, {{together with his}} depressive and temperamental personality, made him many enemies in both the USA and Britain. Roger Fry of the Bloomsbury Group was a particularly virulent critic. In 1920, the critic Charles Lewis Hind observed in his catalogue introduction to an exhibition of Nevinson's recent work: 'It is something, {{at the age of}} thirty one, to be among the most discussed, most successful, most promising, most <b>admired</b> <b>and</b> most hated British artists.' In September 1920, Nevinson designed a poster for a production, by Viola Tree, of The Unknown by Somerset Maughan which showed bombs exploding around a crucifix. The image was deemed to be offensive and was banned from display on the London Underground. Nevinson distributed the poster outside the theatre and gained a great deal of press coverage in the process.|$|E
5|$|Rand's {{contemporary}} admirers included fellow novelists, such as Ira Levin, Kay Nolte Smith and L. Neil Smith, {{and later}} {{writers such as}} Erika Holzer and Terry Goodkind {{have been influenced by}} her. Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist Steve Ditko and musician Neil Peart of Rush. Rand provided a positive view of business, and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have <b>admired</b> <b>and</b> promoted her work. John Allison of BB and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand's ideas, while Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, and John P. Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods, among others, have said they consider Rand crucial to their success.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of the war, Nevinson {{travelled}} to the United States of America, where he painted a number of powerful images of New York. However, his boasting and exaggerated claims of his war experiences, together with his depressive and temperamental personality, made him many enemies in both the USA and Britain. In 1920, the critic Charles Lewis Hind wrote of Nevinson that 'It is something, at the age of thirty one, to be among the most discussed, most successful, most promising, most <b>admired</b> <b>and</b> most hated British artists.' His post-war career, however, was not so distinguished. Nevinson's 1937 memoir Paint and Prejudice, although lively and colourful, is in parts inaccurate, inconsistent, and misleading.|$|E
