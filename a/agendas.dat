5|$|After Jesus' death, his {{followers}} said {{he rose from}} the dead, although exact details of their experiences are unclear. Some of those {{who claimed to have}} witnessed Jesus' resurrection later died for their belief, which indicates that their beliefs were likely genuine. According to Sanders, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the <b>agendas</b> of their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Democracy, or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of democracy is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with <b>agendas.</b> Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E

5|$|Edward Duffy, an {{associate}} professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own <b>agendas.</b> Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.|$|E
5|$|However, much of {{the blame}} for the decay and ruinous state of {{preservation}} of so many palazzi must fall not just on owners unwilling to accept change, but the political <b>agendas</b> of successive socialist governments. Some of the finest Baroque villas and palazzi, including the Palermo palace of the Prince of Lampedusa, are still in ruins following the United States bombing raids of 1943. In many cases, no attempt has been made to restore or even secure them. Those that survived the raids in good repair are often sub-divided into offices or apartments, their Baroque interiors dismantled, divided, and sold.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Heathen organisations {{emerged in the}} United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Iceland, largely {{independently}} from each other. This has been partly attributed to the wider growth of the modern Pagan movement during the 1960s and 1970s, {{as well as the}} development of the New Age milieu, both of which encouraged the establishment of new religious movements intent on reviving pre-Christian belief systems. Further Heathen groups then emerged in the 1990s and 2000s, many of which distanced themselves from overtly political <b>agendas</b> and placed a stronger emphasis on historical authenticity than their 1960s and 1970s forebears.|$|E

To submit a work session <b>agenda</b> item, a Board member should first make reasonable efforts to contact the Chair or Superintendent orally, after which the Board member submitting the <b>agenda</b> item shall confirm the request via email to the Chair and Superintendent, with a copy to all Board members. Every <b>agenda</b> should contain an item for discussing district progress toward strategic plan goals and objectives.

There are a total of 541 district council seats, 412 of which are directly elected and another 27 are ex-officio chairmen of rural committees (families of landowners in the New Territories before 1898); the remaining seats are appointed by the Chief Executive. The Home Affairs Department communicates government policies and plans to the public through the district offices.|$|E
40|$|Traditional, formal, {{face-to-face}} {{meetings are}} heavily reliant on documents for their conduct. One {{of the most}} prominent and important documents is the <b>agenda.</b> The <b>agenda</b> is vital for structuring and driving meeting discussion. The development of the <b>agenda</b> relies on contributions of items for discussion from meeting participants before the meeting. The secretary considers these items for their relevance and potential to achieve the meeting goal. A formal, electronic meeting, being a computer-supported equivalent of a traditional meeting, is also dependent on a useful and effective <b>agenda</b> for its success. This research article presents Logan, a Web Electronic Meeting Document Manager (WEMDM), that provides a novel, hypermedia-based technique for supporting the above <b>agenda</b> development process. Logan allows asynchronous, collaborative development of a meeting <b>agenda.</b> High participant involvement is supported through item contribution and secretarius moderation of contributions. Through a contribution rejection system, moderation supports selection of appropriate contributions for the <b>agenda.</b> Participants are helped in contributing relevant <b>agenda</b> items or prevented from contributing one similar to those in the current <b>agenda</b> via rejected contributions. The process allows flexibility in <b>agenda</b> development as the process may involve one or more iterations. The <b>agenda</b> development process is covered by displaying the interworking of participant <b>agenda</b> development pages. The many Web user interfaces used by the secretarius and other participants in <b>agenda</b> development are shown and described...|$|R
