The recorded images were computer digitalized to generate wound strength curves from a three-dimensional model. A comparison of the wound disruption curves demonstrated that the VCWCD was comparable to the INST or AIPPD in normal wound healing (P 1. 40). The VCWCD provided data with less standard error at 2 days after wounding (P < 05). In separate series of experiments, VCWCD was tested in the early phases of healing and {{was found to be}} sensitive to change at in-tervals of 48 hr after wounding (P <. 005).

40|$|Abstract: <b>Air</b> <b>pressure</b> {{in coastal}} {{unsaturated}} aquifers fluctuates with sea tides, {{as does the}} groundwater level. Tide-induced <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> fluctuations in coastal subsurface systems, however, are not well addressed in literature. Significant diurnal <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> fluctuations are observed below the asphalt pavement in a coastal reclamation area of Hong Kong. A two-dimensional cross-sectional model is built to describe the air-water two-phase flow in the unsaturated zone of the area. TOUGH 2, a general-purpose numerical simulation program for multi-dimensional fluid and heat flows of multiphase, multicomponent fluid mixtures in porous and fracture media, is used to obtain the numerical solutions. The numerical simulation reveals that the significant <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> fluctuation results {{from a combination of}} various factors such as asphalt pavement of extremely low permeability, soil structures of the reclamation area, and rainfall intensity during spring tides. Numerical simulation also reveals that the <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> is approximately proportional to the tidal rate. A great amplitude of the sea level fluctuation will not necessarily lead to high <b>air</b> <b>pressure,</b> if the sea level changes slowly. Coastal unsaturated zones inhale and exhale as the tidal level falls and rises.
