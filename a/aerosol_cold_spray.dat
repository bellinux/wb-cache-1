A classification of impact phenomena is made based on particle size and impact velocity.

40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>spray</b> is {{a unique}} coating {{technology}} that allows for solid state deposition of particles under atmospheric pressure. In this paper, a three dimensional, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) multicomponent model is developed to estimate <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> gas conditions involving both nitrogen and air. Calibration of the model followed by validation is accomplished by considering the thermal history of substrate exposed to <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> supersonic jet. The developed holistic multicomponent model is effective in determining the state of gas and particles from injection point to the substrate surface with the advantage of optimizing very rapid <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> deposition in nanoseconds.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> as repair technique of {{martensitic stainless steel}} components was evaluated through laboratory investigations. An austenitic stainless steel feedstock powder was chosen, instead of soft metals powders like nickel, copper, or aluminum, used for repairing components made in light alloy or cast iron. The present study directly compares the microstructure, the residual stresses, and the micro-hardness of repairs obtained by <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> and by TIG welding, that is commonly used as repair technique in large steel components. XRD and optical metallographic analysis of the repairs showed that <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> offers some advantages, inducing compressive residual stresses in the repair and avoiding alterations of the interface between repair and base material. For these reasons, a heat treatment after the <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> repair {{is not required to}} restore the base material properties, whereas a postweld heat treatment is needed after the welding repair. <b>Cold</b> <b>spray</b> repair also exhibits a higher microhardness than the welding repair.

Laser beams were coupled to a <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> gun {{in order to}} ablate and pre-heat the substrate surface a few milliseconds prior {{to the impact of}} the spray particles. Cohesion and adhesion strength were evaluated by scratch test, standard ASTM C 633 pull test and laser shock (LASAT) technique. The effects of laser ablation before and during <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> operations were investigated. Results demonstrate that laser ablation of the substrate before <b>cold</b> <b>spraying</b> led to a smooth surface which improved adhesion strength.

50|$|In the 1990s, <b>cold</b> <b>spraying</b> (often called gas dynamic <b>cold</b> <b>spray)</b> was introduced. The {{method was}} {{originally}} developed in Russia, with the accidental {{observation of the}} rapid formation of coatings. This occurred while experimenting with particle erosion of a target exposed to a high velocity flow loaded with fine powder in a wind tunnel. In <b>cold</b> <b>spraying,</b> particles are accelerated to very high speeds by the carrier gas forced through a converging-diverging de Laval type nozzle. Upon impact, solid particles with sufficient kinetic energy deform plastically and bond mechanically to the substrate to form a coating. The critical velocity needed to form bonding depends on the material's properties, powder size and temperature. Metals, polymers, ceramics, composite materials and nanocrystalline powders can be deposited using cold spraying.Soft metals such as Cu and Al are best suited for <b>cold</b> <b>spraying,</b> but coating of other materials (W, Ta, Ti, MCrAlY, WC-Co, etc.) by <b>cold</b> <b>spraying</b> has been reported.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this chapter, coating {{properties}} {{are discussed in}} the light of the coating microstructure which is the topic of a first specific subchapter due to specific features related to the <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> itself. The chapter refers to particles, splats and coatings, which result in subheadings but not systematically. The content mainly elaborates on characteristics, phenomena and properties, but also on particular characterization methods provided that they are not conventional and especially suitable for the study of <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> issues. The first subchapter (Sect. 4. 1) is devoted to microstructure since this cannot be disconnected from that, and it is more commonly termed as coating properties. This emphasis is all the more justified as, all in all, microstructures are rather seldom discussed in publications dealing with <b>cold</b> <b>spray.</b> However, considering microstructures is highly relevant to discuss the mechanical and physical behaviour of <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> coatings due to some specific aspects of cold-sprayed materials, at a submicronic scale in particular. The authors try to highlight what is typical of <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> rather than adopting a systematic approach to properties per material or per application.

40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (CFRP) is a {{very competitive}} alternative to aluminum for aircraft structures for lightweighting purposes, but this leaves vulnerability against lightning strike. <b>Cold</b> <b>spray</b> is one coating approach to metallize the polymers, making them lightning strike proof. The aim of this work is to investigate the viability of metallizing aircraft quality CFRPs by <b>cold</b> <b>spray.</b> Copper, aluminum and tin were <b>cold</b> <b>sprayed</b> onto the CFRPs with both a high-pressure and a low-pressure <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> system.

Erosion was found to be the key obstacle to developing continuous coatings on the CFRP substrates with the high-pressure system. On the other hand, continuous tin coatings were successfully obtained on CFRP with the low-pressure system, due to the very soft tin coating the substrate through a 2 ̆ 01 ccrack filling 2 ̆ 01 d mechanism.

40|$|International audienceCoating-substrate {{adhesion}} in <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> is a paramount property, {{the mechanisms}} of which are not yet well elucidated. These mechanisms are governed by metallurgical and morphological phenomena occuring when coldsprayed particles impinge on the substrate.

For this reason, an experimental simulation of the particle-substrate reactions at the particle impingement was developed. This simulation is based on original flier impact experiments from laser shock acceleration of plates/foils (fliers). These were applied to the Cu-Al metallurgically-reactive system to simulate Cu cold-sprayed onto Al. The velocity of the plate was selected {{in the range of}} actual <b>cold</b> <b>spray</b> velocities. Relevant Cu-Al interaction phenomena were featured and studied as a function of flier impact conditions, i. e., primarily, shearing, plastic deformation, phase transformation (including rapid melting/solidification and formation of intermetallics). These phenomena were shown to be similar to those involved in <b>cold</b> <b>spray.</b> This was ascertained by a parallel study of cold-sprayed Cu coating of Al using SEM, TEM, EPMA, and an energy balance and diffusion calculations.
