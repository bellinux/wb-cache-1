5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1917, the {{unrestricted}} submarine warfare campaign—which Germany had launched {{at the beginning of}} February—had so succeeded that the entire Allied war effort was endangered. Strong reinforcements to the Allied antisubmarine forces were desperately needed to avert defeat and needed at once. In response to a request from the Royal Navy for the service of American <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> ships in European waters, the United States Navy began sending destroyers eastward across the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|In August 1940, a British mission, led by Tizard {{and with}} members that {{included}} Cockcroft, {{was sent to}} America to create relations and help advance the research towards war technology with the Americans. Several military technologies were shared, including advances in radar, <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare,</b> aeronautical engineering and explosives. The American radar programme in particular was reinvigorated with an added impetus {{to the development of}} microwave radar and proximity fuses. This prompted the Americans to create the MIT Radiation Laboratory, which would later serve a model for the Los Alamos Laboratory. The mission did not spend much time on nuclear fission, with only two meetings of the subject, mainly about uranium enrichment. In particular, Cockcroft did not report Peierls' and Frisch's findings. Nonetheless, there were important repercussions. A barrier had been broken and a pathway to exchange technical information between the two countries was developed. Moreover, the notion of civilian scientists playing an important role of the development of military technologies was strengthened {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|During {{the next}} two years, VP-8 {{actively}} participated {{in the evolution of}} <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare,</b> to including the development and evaluation of new tactics and equipment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this paper, taking {{account of}} the {{detectability}} of a sensor for a target being {{in the neighborhood of}} a searching point, an optimal distribution of searching effort maximizing detection probability for a stationary target is investigated. Defining a function of extended effect of searching effort, the problem is formulated as a variational problem and theorems of the optimal distribution of searching effort are derived. By this model, the assumption of local effectiveness for searching effort in Koopman's model is removed and reality of the model is improved. A procedure for calculating the optimal (or suboptimal) solution is presented, and applying it, an optimal search plan for the datum search situation is analyzed in detail. Meaning of the conditions of the optimal solution and its properties are elucidated. Generalizations of the model and problems to be investigated in future are also discussed. 1. In t roduc t ion During World War II, Dr. Koopman, B. 0. and his colleagues in the Operations Research Group of U. S. Navy devoted intensive effort to developing efficient search operat ions in <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfares.</b> They es tab 1 ished many fundamental concepts of search theory and Koopman compiled the studies in "Search and Screening [61. ?? He also presented basic theorems for the optimal distribution of searching effor...|$|R
50|$|Further {{training}} in <b>antisubmarine</b> and antiaircraft <b>warfare</b> took {{up much of}} March as McCook prepared to return to European waters. On 18 April, she joined Task Group 27.8 (TG 27.8) and steamed for the United Kingdom, arriving at Plymouth, England on 28 April. The destroyer continued on to Portland and from there participated in a month of intensive amphibious landing exercises at Slapton Sands and at Belfast.|$|R
50|$|The Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) had an {{authorized}} strength in 1992 of 46,000 and maintained some 44,400 personnel and operated 155 major combatants, including thirteen submarines, sixty-four destroyers and frigates, forty-three mine warfare ships and boats, eleven patrol craft, and six amphibious ships. It also flew some 205 fixed-wing aircraft and 134 helicopters. Most of these aircraft {{were used in}} <b>antisubmarine</b> and mine <b>warfare</b> operations.|$|R
25|$|USS PC-1181 {{was fitted}} {{out at the}} Charleston Navy Yard and then {{reported}} for shakedown training out of Miami, Florida and later sonar and <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> training at the Fleet Sonar School at Key West.|$|E
25|$|Walker {{returned}} to Atlantic convoy duty in February 1945. In March, she {{was assigned to}} <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> operations and convoy defence in the waters around the British Isles, continuing in this role until the German surrender in early May.|$|E
25|$|Training {{conducted}} at-sea included {{surface and}} <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare,</b> coordinated gunnery exercises, air defense, and visit, board, search, and seizure drills. Sailors {{took part in}} professional exchanges and discussions while at-sea and on shore. United States Navy personnel participated in a community service project during the port visit to Goa.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1964, Wiltsie joined , Theodore E. Chandler, and [...] in {{anti-aircraft}} warfare exercises off {{the west}} coast {{and served as a}} plane guard for the carrier. She subsequently moved westward to the middle Pacific with Ticonderoga and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 18 February. After completing her exercises in Hawaiian waters, she returned to {{the west coast}} in the spring and participated in <b>antisubmarine</b> and antiair <b>warfare</b> training with [...] and [...]|$|R
50|$|During her 4 {{years of}} {{operations}} along the East Coast {{and in the}} Caribbean with the Atlantic Fleet, Murray aided in postwar development of <b>antisubmarine</b> and mine <b>warfare</b> techniques. She was reclassified to a light minelayer (DM-2) 17 July 1920, and received alterations necessary to her new role. She decommissioned at Philadelphia 1 July 1922, and lay there in reserve until stricken from the Navy list 7 January 1936. She was sold for scrapping 29 September 1936 to Schiavone-Bonomo Corporation, New York City.|$|R
5000|$|On 22 February 1982, Benjamin Stoddert {{departed}} Hawaii for her ninth western Pacific cruise. After a brief stop at Guam on 6 March, she proceeded {{on to the}} Philippines. While {{en route}} to Subic Bay, the warship conducted both <b>antisubmarine</b> and antiair <b>warfare</b> exercises, an underway routine she would continue throughout this deployment. Following a week in Subic Bay, the guided-missile destroyer steamed to Korea and, between 28 and 30 March, participated in amphibious Exercise [...] "Team Spirit 82." [...] She then sailed between Hong Kong, Subic Bay, and Yokosuka before anchoring in Shimoda, Japan, on 15 May. In the latter port, she {{took part in the}} Black Ship Festival, commemorating Commodore Matthew C. Perry's opening of Japan to foreign trade in 1854. Benjamin Stoddert returned to Subic Bay on the 24th.|$|R
25|$|In 1986 the Navy's {{order of}} battle {{included}} two Xia-class SSBNs armed with twelve CSS-N-3 missiles and three Han-class SSNs armed with six SY-2 cruise missiles. In the late 1980s, major deficiencies reportedly remained in <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare,</b> mine warfare, naval electronics (including electronic countermeasures equipment), and naval aviation capabilities.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} nine months, Seadragon was {{employed}} in local operations. In June 1961, she headed west for her first tour in the western Pacific (WestPac), during which she participated in Seventh Fleet exercises – primarily <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> training exercises – and completed a submerged endurance cruise of 58 days. In October, she returned to Pearl Harbor and local operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} {{was established}} in 1949 as Composite Squadron VC-33 at NAS Norfolk. It flew the TBM-3E/N/Q Avenger and a few SNB-5 Texans. Its mission was <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> (ASW). It moved to NAS Atlantic City in 1950, where its mission changed to night attack. It sent three detachments to the Korean War aboard carriers, where it distinguished itself in night attack and ECM missions.|$|E
50|$|At the time, the Academy's {{effort to}} support {{national}} defense readiness, the Committee on Nitric Acid Supply, {{was approved by}} Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. Nitric acid was the substance basic {{in the making of}} propellants such as cordite, high explosives, dyes, fertilizers, and other products but availability was limited due to World War I. The NRC, through its committee, recommended importing Chilean saltpeter and the construction of four new ordinance plants. These recommendations were accepted by the War Department in June 1917, although the plants were not completed prior {{to the end of the}} war. In 1918, Wilson formalized the NRC's existence under Executive Order 2859. During World War I the United States was at war, the NRC operated as the Department of Science and Research of the Council of National Defense as well as the Science and Research Division of the United States Army Signal Corps. When war was first declared, the Council had organized committees on <b>antisubmarine</b> and gas <b>warfare.</b>|$|R
25|$|Kidd arrived Norfolk, VA 5 February 1962 {{and joined}} Task Force Alfa for <b>Antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> (ASW) exercises. On 24 April she was {{assigned}} to the Naval Destroyer School at Newport, R.I.. After a cruise to the Caribbean, on 1 July 1962 she resumed Naval Reserve training. Kidd was decommissioned 19 June 1964, entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, and was berthed at the Philadelphia Shipyard.|$|E
25|$|Thresher {{conducted}} further {{trials and}} fired test torpedoes {{before returning to}} Portsmouth on 29 November 1961. The boat remained in port {{through the end of}} the year, and spent the first two months of 1962 evaluating her sonar and Submarine Rocket (SUBROC) systems. In March, the submarine participated in NUSUBEX 2–62 (an exercise designed to improve the tactical capabilities of nuclear submarines) and in <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> training with Task Group ALPHA.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to Hawaii that spring, Carpenter resumed her regular routine of local operations and ASW exercises out of Pearl. Her fourth cruise began on 4 January 1956 when the destroyer set sail {{for the western}} Pacific. Operating out of Yokosuka, the destroyer conducted extensive <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> (ASW) training with ships of the 7th Fleet, visited ports in the Philippines and Hong Kong, and operated with units of the Royal Australian Navy.|$|E
25|$|Spot {{arrived at}} Pearl Harbor on 29 July for an {{extended}} overhaul and was still there when hostilities ceased. She sailed for San Diego on 27 August and provided services for <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> units there from 3 September 1945 to 2 March 1946. The ship then sailed to San Francisco to prepare for inactivation. She was decommissioned at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 19 June and attached to the Pacific Reserve Fleet.|$|E
25|$|Patrol craft were {{designed}} primarily for anti-submarine warfare and mine sweeping and the armament reflected this. A secondary group of arms were anti-aircraft. As an <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> ("ASW") ship, it {{was equipped with}} both sonar and radar to detect enemy submarines. Once such enemy submarines were detected, the ship's weapons were brought to bear. The ship's radar had a range of around , as the crew noted during their pursuit of an e-boat in February 1945.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a similar}} cruise, 6 January – 2 July 1958, {{the ship was}} redesignated CVS-12 (anti-submarine warfare support carrier). In August, she entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for the {{conversion}} work to an ASW carrier. On 3 April 1959, she sailed from Long Beach to join the 7th Fleet in <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> tactics ranging from Japan to Okinawa and the Philippines. She returned home in October, for training along the western seaboard.|$|E
25|$|The {{island is}} named after the day of its {{recorded}} discovery, Ascension Day. It played a role as an important safe haven and coaling station to mariners and for commercial airliners during the days of international air travel by flying boats. During World War II {{it was an important}} naval and air station, especially providing <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> bases in the Battle of the Atlantic. Ascension Island was garrisoned by the British Admiralty from 22 October 1815 to 1922.|$|E
25|$|In February 1975, Tunny began {{preparations}} {{for her first}} deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. She stood out of Charleston on 6 March 1975 and headed across the Atlantic Ocean. She came under operational control of the United States Sixth Fleet on 16 March 1975. During {{the first part of}} her tour in the Mediterranean, she operated with Task Force 60, conducting <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> exercises with the other ships of the task force. Following refit and upkeep alongside a submarine tender in June and early July 1975 at Santo Stefano, Sardinia, Italy, Tunny rejoined the Sixth Fleet as a unit of Task Force 69 and resumed <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> training. After participating in a major Sixth Fleet exercise late in July and early in August 1975, she departed the Mediterranean for home. She changed operational control from the Sixth Fleet to the United States Atlantic Fleet Submarine Force on 17 August 1975 and arrived in Charleston, concluding her deployment, on 29 August 1975. After a routine post-deployment standdown in September and repairs and alterations Charleston Naval Shipyard at Charleston in October and November, she resumed operations—mostly attack submarine training—out of Charleston on 20 November 1975.|$|E
25|$|After making several {{goodwill}} {{visits to}} ports {{in the southern}} United States, Balao joined the ships of Destroyer Squadron24 (DesRon24) in a combined <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> (ASW) training and goodwill cruise to South America that began on 6 January 1957. After joint exercises with the navies of several South American countries, the ship made liberty calls to principal ports such as La Guaira, Venezuela; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Montevideo, Uruguay; Mar del Plata and Buenos Aires, Argentina. The submarine returned to Key West on 22 March.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept for}} the attack came from Navy Captain Francis Low, Assistant Chief of Staff for <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare,</b> who {{reported}} to Admiral Ernest J. King on 10 January 1942, that he thought twin-engined Army bombers could be launched from an aircraft carrier, after observing several at a naval airfield in Norfolk, Virginia, where the runway was painted with {{the outline of a}} carrier deck for landing practice. The attack was planned and led by Doolittle, a famous military test pilot, civilian aviator, and aeronautical engineer before the war.|$|E
25|$|The ship {{returned}} to the east coast in September 1954 and resumed her normal operations. In December, she entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for overhaul and conversion to an <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> (ASW) aircraft carrier. On 10 January 1955, while still undergoing conversion, she was redesignated CVS-40. Her alterations were completed that summer and, after shakedown, the carrier operated around Quonset Point, Rhode Island, conducting training missions with the ASW air squadrons based there. That fall, she participated in exercises with Hunter-Killer Group 4 before returning to Quonset Point {{to prepare for the}} 1956 Springboard exercise.|$|E
25|$|Three days later, SS-400 again headed west. On 16 May, she {{returned}} to Subic Bay; and, on 23 May, she continued on to Tsingtao where she provided <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> training services to TF71 into July. On 5May, she sailed for Shanghai, whence she proceeded back to Pearl Harbor. From 26July 1946 to 5May 1947, she conducted operations in the Hawaiian area. Overhaul at Mare Island took her through the summer. In early October, {{she returned}} to Hawaii, and on 27May, she sailed westward for another tour in the Far East.|$|E
25|$|After {{operations}} off the Atlantic {{coast and}} in the Caribbean, Robinson was again bound for the Mediterranean in company with Destroyer Squadrons 8 and 32 on 5 November 1955. She visited such Mediterranean ports as Rhodes, Greece; and Beirut, Lebanon; before steaming for Greenwich, England; Antwerp, Belgium; Bremerhaven, Germany; and Edinburgh, Scotland. After independent operations in waters {{to the north of}} the Shetland Islands, she arrived at Derry, Northern Ireland on 27 January for <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> and convoy exercises with British warships. This duty terminated 13 February 1956 and Robinson returned to Norfolk on the 22d for antisubmarine operations in the Virginia Capes, and shore bombardment practice at Bloodsworth Island.|$|E
25|$|These {{warships}} {{were designed}} as multimission destroyers {{to fit the}} antiaircraft warfare (AAW) role with their powerful Aegis radar and surface-to-air missiles; <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> (ASW), with their towed sonar array, anti-submarine rockets, and ASW helicopter; antisurface warfare (ASuW) with their Harpoon missile launcher; and strategic land strike role with their Tomahawk missiles. With upgrades to their AN/SPY-1 phased radar systems and their associated missile payloads {{as part of the}} Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, the ships of this class have also begun to demonstrate some promise as mobile antiballistic missile and anti-satellite weaponry platforms. Some versions of the class no longer have the towed sonar, or Harpoon missile launcher. Their hull and superstructure were designed to have a reduced radar cross section.|$|E
25|$|From 3 May to 1 June 1954, she was {{attached}} to the Operational Development Force at Key West for tests of new weapons and equipment. She participated in Operation Springboard in the Caribbean from 21 February to 28 March 1955, and continued to alternate service with the Submarine School with <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> and fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off Bermuda, as well as rendering services to the Fleet Sonar School and Operational Development Force at Key West. Between February and April 1959, she cruised through the Panama Canal along the coasts of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile for exercises with South American navies. On 27 May 1960, she entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for an overhaul which continued through October 1960.|$|E
25|$|The ship next visited Al Jubayl, Saudi Arabia (14–17 July 1985), briefly {{patrolled the}} Persian Gulf, and then {{completed}} upkeep at Mina Salman, Bahrain (22–31 July). On 6 August, Klakring escorted La Salle, and fueled and provisioned at Sitrah on 20 August. The frigate sailed from the Persian Gulf, and (25–28 August) visited Karachi, Pakistan. She {{passed through the}} Strait of Hormuz into the Persian Gulf on 31 August, and completed an additional upkeep at Dubai, UAE (3–10 September). The ship anchored at Sitrah for a Combat Systems Groom (13–15 September). On 20 September, she sailed from the Persian Gulf and trained with the Indian Ocean Battle Group, focusing on aircraft carrier operations, anti-air warfare, underway replenishment, and <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare.</b> Klakring returned to the Persian Gulf on 24 September, training along the way with French aviso Quartier-Maître Anquetil.|$|E
25|$|USS Tarawa (CV/CVA/CVS-40, AVT-12) {{was one of}} 24 s built {{during and}} shortly after World War II for the United States Navy. The ship was the first US Navy ship to bear the name, and was named for the bloody 1943 Battle of Tarawa. Tarawa was {{commissioned}} in December 1945, too late to serve in World War II. After serving a short time in the Far East, she was decommissioned in 1949. She was soon recommissioned after the Korean War began, serving in the Atlantic {{as a replacement for}} carriers sent to Korea. In the early 1950s, she was redesignated an attack carrier (CVA) and then an <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> carrier (CVS). Except for one tour in the Far East, she spent her entire second career operating in the Atlantic and Caribbean. Consequently, Tarawa was the only ship of her class to never see combat action.|$|E
25|$|RCAF airmen {{served with}} RAF fighter and bomber squadrons, and played key {{roles in the}} Battle of Britain, <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> during the Battle of the Atlantic, and the bombing campaigns against Germany. Even though many RCAF {{personnel}} served with the RAF, No. 6 Group RAF Bomber Command was formed entirely of RCAF squadrons. Canadian air force personnel also provided close support to Allied forces during the Battle of Normandy and subsequent land campaigns in Europe. To free up male RCAF personnel who were needed on active operational or training duties, the RCAF Women's Division was formed in 1941. By {{the end of the}} war, the RCAF would be the fourth largest allied air force. In line with other Commonwealth countries, a women's corps entitled the Canadian Women's Army Corps, similar to the RCAF Women's Division, was established to release men for front-line duties. The corps existed from 1941 to 1946, was re-raised in 1948 and finally disbanded in 1964 (see Canadian women during the World Wars).|$|E
25|$|Arriving at Cold Bay on 19 March 1945 {{and newly}} {{promoted}} to captain, Maxwell took {{command of the}} naval base there the following day. Under his command were 694 U.S. Navy and United States Coast Guard personnel, 47 United States Marines, and a U.S. Army contingent of 605; his personnel strength soon stabilized at around 1,500 as Army personnel transferred out and naval personnel replaced them. He found that an advance party under his second-in-command, U.S. Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander John J. Hutson, had already established Detachment 3294s <b>Antisubmarine</b> <b>Warfare</b> Department. He also discovered that the naval facilities required more rehabilitation {{than he had been}} led to believe, so he moved his command into Fort Randall, which had been closed since November 1944, and set about readying its facilities to support Project Hula, including the establishment of housing, classrooms, movie theaters, a radio station, and a softball field, the selection of instructors for courses in radio and radar operation, engineering, gunnery, minesweeping, damage control, and landing craft operation, and the procurement of radios, radars, minesweeping gear, gyrocompasses, engines, movie projectors, and training films and other educational tools.|$|E
25|$|Yorktown {{emerged from}} the {{shipyard}} in January 1961 and returned to Long Beach on 27 January. She conducted refresher training and then resumed normal west coast operations until late July. On 29 July, the aircraft carrier stood out of Long Beach, bound once again for the Orient. She made an extended stopover in the Hawaiian Islands in August and, consequently, did not arrive in Yokosuka until 4 September. That {{tour of duty in}} the Far East consisted of a normal schedule of anti-air and <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>warfare</b> exercises as well as the usual round of port visits. She concluded the deployment at Long Beach on 2 March 1962. Normal west coast operations occupied her time through the summer and into the fall. On 26 October 1962, the warship left Long Beach in her wake and set a course for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, then on to Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines in the Far East. During that deployment, she served as flagship for Carrier Division 19. She participated in several ASW and AAW exercises, including the SEATO ASW exercise, Operation Sea Serpent. The deployment lasted until 6 June 1963, at which time the carrier set a course back to Long Beach.|$|E
