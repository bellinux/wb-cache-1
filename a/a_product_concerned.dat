40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} the idea of a German Menace was not simply <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of <b>concerns</b> about the defence of the British Isles, but rather it was born out of the mentality of British imperialism. Over the period 1896 - 1903, imperial antagonism between Germany and Britain, in various contexts around the globe, inspired the popular perception of the German Menace as a distinctly imperial threat. Where the established historiography locates the beginning of the Anglo-German rivalry within the development of the naval armaments race after 1904, this study traces the British fear of Germany much earlier and, crucially, much further away from the shores of the North Sea. The Dreadnought Race was <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of pre-existing anxieties; this thesis will explain the context of imperial anxiety out of which the coherent concept of the German Menace developed. It reveals how specific imperial crises informed British popular beliefs and how the stereotypes of German covetousness, autocracy and efficiency coalesced to form a powerful force in British society and politics that had reached its peak by 1903. By 1903 Germany was widely regarded as a menace to the British Empire...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{illustrates the}} process of designing for online and offline interaction in a museum context. The project consisted of the design and development of an online community platform for the museum visitors {{as well as of}} interactive, participative exhibitions inside the museum. Theoretical insights were drawn from extensive field work consisting of observations of designers’ daily work, qualitative interviews and document analysis. The nature of designing without <b>a</b> <b>product</b> is examined empirically and theoretically. Design without <b>a</b> <b>product</b> is <b>concerned</b> with discovering what would make a new design work for the people engaging in or with it. In their practice, designers develop and are guided by a set of design theories of what they think would make a new design work. These theories are independent of the object of design. The same theories can be equally applied to the design of a new online community as well as of an offline participatory exhibition. The findings illustrate that in practicing design without <b>a</b> <b>product,</b> designers deal with problems that are too complex and dynamic to be solved once and for all; they can only be advanced one step at a time. Second, designing without <b>a</b> <b>product</b> is <b>a</b> distributed practice. Design for interaction is constantly evolving and emerging out of the work performed by designers, community members and others. Third, in designing without <b>a</b> <b>product,</b> design is appropriated as a liberal art.

Its domain model integrates recycling knowledge from several information sources and is capable of disassembling <b>a</b> <b>product</b> into its elementary parts. An information extraction approach allows the automatic integration of relevant content from new Web sources, which were suggested by the user. The mobile application enables the user to initiate interaction with this model over three different ways of describing <b>a</b> <b>product.</b> Beside insights <b>concerning</b> information access and user interaction, a first evaluation of the prototype indicates that the employed fused domain model may outperform results achieved with a traditional approach to web-based information search concerning recycling information.

It should also not present errors, or these must be easy to solve, in case they occur, thus providing high satisfaction to users. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usability of the "System of health and nutrition monitoring - nutrition of school children" (NUTRISIM). METHODS: A sample of 17 Information Technology professionals evaluated the system and answered the "Questionnaire for System Usability", which determines the level of usability of systems by the Fuzzy Logic. The questionnaire contains 30 questions, which are divided into six metrics. The usability of the system determines six usability criteria in a large Fuzzy scale. RESULTS: With the exception of the metric "error control", all metrics were analyzed as "very good". The metrics "error control", "efficiency" and "satisfaction" presented medium amplitude, which is a better result in relation to the metrics "easy to learn", "easy to remember" and "effectiveness", which was assessed as "high". CONCLUSION: The study showed that the system is easy to be learned and used, but the answers are scattered.

First, the existing freshwater resources in Israel/Palestine need to be examined, along with how they might change in the future.

Even with these struggles over territory, whether or not Israelis and Palestinians can come to a peaceful solution regarding Palestinian independence, the human right to and the need for water must be considered. Therefore, the ways of thinking about solutions need to be examined to protect these rights and needs.

40|$|The {{content of}} this thesis is a {{detailed}} investigation of Rho invariants {{of the total}} spaces of fiber bundles. The main idea is to use adiabatic limits of Eta invariants to obtain a formula for Rho invariants that separates the contribution coming from the fiber and the one coming from the base. An adiabatic metric on a fiber bundle rescales the metric of the base manifold {{in such a way}} that the geometry of the fiber bundle approaches <b>a</b> <b>product</b> situation. <b>Concerning</b> the Eta invariant, this process has received a far-reaching treatment in the literature. For this reason, one concern of this thesis is to formulate the technical aspects of local index theory for families of Dirac operator in terms of the odd signature operator, and place known results in a context which permits the treatment of Rho invariants. The resulting formula expresses the Rho invariant as a sum of three terms, each of which is of a very different nature. First of all, a higher dimensional analog of the Rho invariants of the fiber has to be integrated over the base. This term is of a local nature on the base, but contains global spectral information about the fiber. The next term is essentially a Rho invariant of the base, where the underlying flat connection is defined on the bundle of cohomology groups of the fiber. Lastly, there is a purely topological term, which can be computed from the spectral sequence o...|$|R
40|$|Design {{constitutes}} a major phase in product development {{and calls for}} complex decisions to be taken for realising <b>an</b> optimal <b>product.</b> <b>A</b> poor design could lead to high redesign costs and <b>a</b> delay in <b>product</b> realization, which could in turn hamper the successful commercialization of the <b>product.</b> <b>A</b> prime <b>concern</b> in design is to translate the functional requirements of the product into design requirements, and then generate feasible solutions that meet the design requirements. Generally, design is an open-ended problem {{with more than one}} solution, each with its own pros and cons.
