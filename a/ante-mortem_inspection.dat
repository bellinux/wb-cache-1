40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the proportion of fetuses destroyed due to the slaughter of pregnant cows at Incidence of Fetal Wastage in Cattle Slaughtered at the Shahrekord Industrial Slaughter House, Shahrekord, Iran. A retrospective study was conducted on abattoir records kept by the Chahar-Mahal-O-Bakhtiari State Department of Veterinary Services over a 4 years period. The study showed an incidence rate ranging from 1. 50 - 2. 10 % over the 4 year study period (Average of 1. 8 %). This practice constitutes a huge drain on the animal protein availability for human consumption in a developing country like Iran. It is therefore recommended that appropriate legislation be put in place and enforced to control the slaughter of pregnant animals. Comprehensive <b>ante-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> should also be carried out by abattoir staff on all animals intended for slaughter for human consumption...|$|E
40|$|Zoonoses, {{which account}} for {{approximately}} 75 % of emerging human infectious diseases worldwide, pose a re-emerging threat to public health. With an ever-increasing interrelationship between humans, livestock and wildlife species, the threat to human health will rise to unprecedented levels. Wildlife species contribute {{to the majority of}} emerging diseases; therefore, there is an urgent need to define control systems of zoonoses of wildlife origin but very little information exists. In this review, we examine prevalent zoonotic infections reported in Namibia between 1990 and 2009 and assess their potential impact on the growing wildlife industry. A wide spectrum of zoonotic diseases was confirmed in both livestock and wildlife species, with rabies and anthrax cases being over-represented and also showing the widest species distribution. Whilst vaccination and <b>ante-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> against these diseases may curb infected livestock species from entering the human food chain, such practices are difficult to implement in free-ranging wildlife species. In this context, {{there is a need to}} improve existing control measures and/or develop novel and better interventional strategies to reduce the threat of this re-emerging global problem. This review provides the basis for initiating a multidisciplinary evidence-based approach to control zoonoses in countries with thriving wildlife and game farming...|$|E
40|$|A safe {{food supply}} is {{essential}} to public health. Changes in management practices affecting animal health could significantly impact public health. While animals with clinical illness will not pass <b>ante-mortem</b> <b>inspection,</b> animals with subclinical illness could be harvested. These animals could have peelouts, or pleural/peritoneal lesions that do not allow for complete viscera removal, requiring extra trimming. Swine are commonly asymptomatic carriers of Salmonella 3 ̆c 3 ̆e infection. If animals are also infected with respiratory pathogens, {{it is possible that}} peelouts could lead to carcass contamination. This study has three objectives: to obtain a peelout prevalence estimate, determine if common swine respiratory pathogens are associated with peelouts (Streptococcus suis, Pasteurella multocida, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Haemophilus parasuis, Actinobacillus suis, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 3 ̆c 3 ̆e), and determine if carcasses with peelouts {{are more likely to have}} Salmonella contamination. Six abattoirs from different geographical locations in the United States were chosen, and two different sampling periods were run. Samples were taken from 50 lesioned carcasses and 50 non-lesioned carcasses. Two sets of samples were taken: a lung sample immediately after evisceration and a pleural swab from the corresponding carcass after trimming and before the final carcass rinse. The pleural swabs were tested for Salmonella 3 ̆c 3 ̆e and the lung samples tested for respiratory pathogens using a standard bacteriological isolation and culture protocol.

40|$|In recent times, many {{zoonotic}} diseases have emerged with serious negative consequences on humans. In {{the light of}} this, <b>ante-mortem</b> <b>inspections</b> were conducted, using body condition scoring to assess the health status of livestock presenting for slaughter, and to identify issues relating to meat inspection in four purposively selected government approved abattoirs in Benue State, Nigeria. The result of our assessment showed that 5. 0 % of the cattle and goats presented for slaughter during the investigation period were highly emaciated animals with a prevalence range of 0. 0 – 12. 1 % with variance between abattoirs, whereas 37. 9 % were moderately emaciated and 57. 2 % had good body condition. Extreme emaciation was higher in cattle (6. 7 %) compared to the goats (3. 2 %). The moderately high prevalence of emaciated animals {{intended for human consumption}} coupled with unorganized and inappropriate meat inspection in the studied abattoirs has serious public health implications. To prevent consumers from contacting {{zoonotic diseases}}, education of butchers and traders is necessary for thorough and effective inspections.

40|$|Information on {{the level}} of foetal wastage in {{slaughtered}} cattle in Tanzania is limited. A three-month observational study (April – June 2014) of animals slaughtered at the Tanga abattoir in Tanga region, Tanzania was carried out to determine the number of pregnant cows slaughtered. The total number of cattle slaughtered during the study period was 3643, representing a monthly kill average of 1214 and a daily kill average of 40. Over 98 % of the cattle presented to the abattoir for slaughter were local breed (Tanzania shorthorn zebu) and most were above 3 years of age. Improved breeds of cattle represented only 1. 3 % of all slaughters. Of the cattle slaughtered, 2256 (61. 9 %) were female and 1387 (38. 1 %) were male. A total of 655 slaughtered cows were pregnant, representing a foetal wastage of 29. 1 %. Of the 655 recovered foetuses, 333 (50. 8 %) were male and 322 (49. 2 %) were female. Of the recovered foetuses, 25. 8 % were recovered in the first, 42. 7 % in the second and 31. 6 % in the third trimester. This study indicates cases of significant foetal losses, negatively impacting future replacement stock {{as a result of the}} slaughter of pregnant animals.

40|$|Syndromic {{surveillance}} (SyS) systems currently exploit {{various sources}} of health-related data, {{most of which}} are collected for purposes other than surveillance (e. g. economic). Several European SyS systems use data collected during meat inspection for syndromic surveillance of animal health, as some diseases may be more easily detected post-mortem than at their point of origin or during the <b>ante-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> upon arrival at the slaughterhouse. In this paper we use simulation to evaluate the performance of a quasi-Poisson regression (also known as an improved Farrington) algorithm for the detection of disease outbreaks during post-mortem inspection of slaughtered animals. When parameterizing the algorithm based on the retrospective analyses of 6 years of historic data, the probability of detection was satisfactory for large (range 83 - 445 cases) outbreaks but poor for small (range 20 - 177 cases) outbreaks. Varying the amount of historical data used to fit the algorithm can help increasing the probability of detection for small outbreaks. However, while the use of a 0 · 975 quantile generated a low false-positive rate, in most cases, more than 50 % of outbreak cases had already occurred at the time of detection. High variance observed in the whole carcass condemnations time-series, and lack of flexibility in terms of the temporal distribution of simulated outbreaks resulting from low reporting frequency (monthly), constitute major challenges for early detection of outbreaks in the livestock population based on meat inspection data. Reporting frequency should be increased in the future to improve timeliness of the SyS system while increased sensitivity may be achieved by integrating meat inspection data into a multivariate system simultaneously evaluating multiple sources of data on livestock healt...|$|E

30|$|Approximately, 27.3 % of {{the farmers}} who {{consigned}} these animals for slaughter were ignorant {{of the fact that}} the cows were actually pregnant but only 21.8 % {{of the farmers}} were aware of the physiological status of these cows. At least 6 % of the culled cows were “discarded” for fertility reasons when they were actually pregnant. Otherwise known as euthanasia, few authors have indicated that emergency slaughter may be an exceptional situation that might necessitate slaughtering pregnant animals (Grandin 1994; Butterworth, 2000; Biggs and Blackwell 2005). When emergency slaughter remains the only alternative, it is expected that the farmer contact the slaughter operators and the Official Veterinarian must rather be present during the <b>ante-mortem</b> and post-mortem <b>inspection</b> to declare the meat either fit or unfit for human consumption (Gregory and Grandin 2007).

The working group established within the CNSA thoroughly analysed the Italian situation, also by means of data collection. This led to the identification of two main slaughtering patterns in Italy: high-capacity slaughter plants (approximately 65 - 70 %), mainly slaughtering “heavy pigs” raised in an integrated swine production system, and low/very low slaughter intensity plants, where various types of pigs are handled (30 - 35 % on the whole Italian production). The investigation also highlighted the difficulty in extrapolating and aggregating data concerning the food chain (health hazards linked with the herd of origin, transport and so on) and the outcome of <b>ante-mortem</b> and post-mortem <b>inspection.</b> Finally, considering the data available, the Committee states that {{it is not possible to}} assess the impact that a modification of the European legislation on meat inspection would have on consumers’ protection and suggested that the Ministry of Health launch pilot programs to gather the data necessary to justify and guide Italy’s position in the debate that will be held at European level.

40|$|The {{welfare of}} horses transported for {{slaughter}} {{is a growing}} concern in several countries, including Canada, Iceland and the United States of America (USA). Slaughter of horses involves transportation of horses to a regulated facility and slaughter procedures such as lairage and stunning. The main objective {{of this study was to}} identify welfare issues and associated risk factors, particularly those associated with transportation. A welfare assessment protocol was developed to identify pertinent welfare issues, such as injuries, dehydration and fitness for transportation. Prevalence of horses with injuries, a pre-existing clinical condition, a body condition score of less than 3 (on a scale of 5) and those in a non-ambulatory state were calculated. Skin temperature, respiration rate, blood lactate concentration, blood glucose concentration, plasma osmolality, plasma total protein concentration and packed cell volume were also measured. Welfare assessment of horses in Iceland was undertaken before and after transportation to the slaughter plant and at slaughter. Forty six journeys lasting up to 3 hours were studied. Welfare issues identified were the prevalence of bruising and dehydration. Adults were more prone to bruising and dehydration than foals. Some horses showed signs of consciousness after stunning (1. 6 %) indicating ineffective stunning. In Canada, a prospective study observed 150 truckloads of horses after transportation to a Canadian slaughter plant. Associations between risk factors and welfare outcomes were evaluated using linear regression models. Welfare issues identified were prevalence of injuries, pre-existing clinical conditions, low body condition scores, and the presence of some non-ambulatory horses. There was a significant association between journey duration and the number of horses per truckload with injuries. Signs of dehydration were identified and were associated with journey duration and season. Blood lactate concentration at slaughter indicated increased anaerobic metabolic activity, which was affected by season (summer or winter) and lairage duration. A retrospective study was performed by collating data from all shipper certificates obtained from USDA for journeys in 2009 from the USA to equine slaughter plants in Canada. This study identified journey durations range from one hour to 105 hours. Some injuries in horses transported for slaughter were visible at <b>ante-mortem</b> <b>inspection,</b> whereas other injuries, such as bruises were not visible until post-mortem examination. Digital infrared thermography (DT) was evaluated as a potential tool to detect bruising ante-mortem. A preliminary study to evaluate factors affecting skin temperature (as measured by DT) indicated that an outdoor environment significantly affected skin temperature measured on different regions of interest (ROI) compared with an indoor environment. However, thermal symmetry between ROIs was maintained in outdoor conditions. Using these findings, a second study was performed to evaluate the methodology to detect bruising ante-mortem. Sensitivity to detect bruising was low, possibly due to selection of horses that did not spend time in lairage (i. e. there was no equilibrium time for skin temperature to stabilise after transport). In conclusion, in Canada, injuries and dehydration were mainly associated with journey duration, aggressive behaviour between horses and season. In Iceland, injuries and dehydration were mainly associated with age (adult or foal) ...|$|E

New Zealand Veterinary Journal, 64 (4), 238 - 242. doi: 10. 1080 / 00480169. 2015. 1130663 The systemic infection of organs and skeletal muscle outside the alimentary tract with Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Map) has sparingly been {{mentioned in the}} many scientific studies undertaken in sheep, yet within the past decade a zoonotic association has been proposed. The occurrence of systemic Map infection {{at the time of}} slaughter might enable this organism to be present in food products, such as meat, destined for human consumption, creating a potential link to public health and may therefore attract some attention by the meat industry. There have been very few studies investigating whether meat has potential to expose humans to Map. With this lack of information, it is difficult for the meat industry to make informed decisions in the event that public perception establishes a link with Crohn’s disease. Chapter one provides a brief history of Map infection in ruminants and suggests there may be a need to identify steps that could be implemented to mitigate human exposure to Map. The aims for this thesis therefore were to i) determine whether skeletal muscle from naturally infected animals provides a source of Map for humans, ii) provide information on systemic Map infection in sheep, identifying classes of stock that may pose a risk for exposure iii) develop a histological diagnostic test for quantifying the cost of systemic Map infection in sheep with potential use in therapeutic efficacy studies, and iv) provide a potential means to mass screen sheep at time of slaughter using real time spectroscopy to identify systemically infected animals. Chapter two reviews the source of Map, transmission pathways and subsequent availability of modern diagnostic tests for identifying sheep infected with this organism. There is a lack of published information on systemic Map infection, with little known about how this event develops, how the immune system reacts when Map bacteraemia occurs, whether systemic 3 Map infection has a cost to production and whether quantification of this cost can be assessed with currently available diagnostic tests. The aim of Chapter three was to determine whether skeletal muscle from ewes with clinical Johne’s disease contained Map and therefore provided a potential source of Map for humans. Fifty one mixed-age, low body condition score ewes (1. 5 / 5), from a farm where clinical Johne’s disease had been diagnosed, were necropsied. This included 48 ewes with Map infection confirmed by ileal BACTEC radiometric culture and 21 with clinical Johne’s disease confirmed by ileal histopathology. In 18 ewes with clinical Johne’s disease, Map was found in the culture of blood (n= 13), blood and muscle (n= 10) and muscle (n= 5). In ewes without clinical Johne’s disease, Map was found in 5 / 30 animals including muscle (n= 4) and blood (n= 1). It was concluded that meat from ewes with clinical Johne’s disease is likely to contain Map and suggested that systemic Map infection may also occur in sheep without clinical disease when managed in direct contact with clinically affected ewes shortly before slaughter. The presence of Map within skeletal muscle was further investigated in Chapter four with 24 healthy mixed age ewes selected from one farm, which were not in contact with clinically affected ewes. Ileal and mesenteric lymph node cultures identified Map infection in 12 / 24 ewes. All other tissues and faeces were culture negative, and only 1 / 24 animals seroconverted. In flocks where Map is present, it appears that up to 50 % of animals may be latently infected. Lack of positive culture from blood and muscle samples in latently infected sheep suggests that meat from healthy sheep may not be a source of human exposure to Map. In New Zealand, the current measure to mitigate human exposure to Map from meat products is the identification of clinically affected sheep prior to slaughter through <b>ante-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> with emaciated animals rejected at time of slaughter and processed as pet food. 4 However, this screening process is non-specific with many different causes of emaciation. Currently there are no legal requirements or recommendations from the meat industry for the downgrading of meat from carcases with macroscopic signs of clinical Johne’s disease and, as such, meat from these sheep enters the human food chain. Identifying sheep with systemic Map infection is problematic, with diagnosis requiring solid or liquid media culture of Map or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify Map specific DNA. These diagnostic tests are expensive, time consuming and require a high level of expertise. They are therefore unlikely to be adopted by the meat industry as a screening tool for systemic Map infection in sheep. With the aim to develop a diagnostic tool that is relatively quick, simple and cheap, 126 mixed age ewes in poor body condition were euthanised as described in Chapter five and their Johne’s disease status determined through histopathology and Ziehl Neelsen stain of the ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes. Sixty ewes were differentiated histopathologically with 51 clinically affected including Type 3 b (n= 40) and 3 c (n= 11) and nine not clinically affected with Type 1 (n= 5), Type 2 (n= 3) and Type 3 a (n= 1) ileal lesions. Hepatic epithelioid macrophage micro-granulomas (HEM) were observed only in ewes with Type 3 b or 3 c ileal lesions, all of which were ELISA positive. When present, HEM were in equal densities in liver section and biopsy samples. The sensitivity and specificity for liver histopathology (section or biopsy) for predicting clinical OJD was 96 % (95 % CI, 87 - 99 %) and 100 % (95 % CI, 95 - 100 %), respectively, and Cohen’s Kappa had an almost perfect level of agreement between HEM formation, ileal pathology and ELISA sero-positivity. This study determined that the presence of HEM provided a surrogate measure of ileal pathology, identified ewes with clinical Johne’s disease, and that biopsy samples and post mortem sections were equally suitable for the diagnosis of HEM. Encouraged by the predictive quality of HEM in Chapter five, it was hypothesised that the identification of HEM from biopsies may provide a method to follow the progression of Map 5 infection through serial sampling and to quantify the production cost of systemic Map infection. The longitudinal challenge study in Chapter six utilised the identification of HEM as an indicator of systemic Map infection in naïve lambs orally challenged with 1 x 109 organisms on ten occasions over 30 days. The presence of HEM was related to live weight gain, body condition score, development of clinical disease or occurrence of self-cure (recovery), and ELISA serology All challenged lambs developed HEM, a higher density of HEM was associated with increased ELISA S/P ratios with a Cohen’s kappa substantial level of agreement, and mean weight loss (- 2. 03 kg) from 51 to 154 days post challenge with an almost perfect level of agreement. Thereafter, lower weight gain led to a mean body weight difference of - 8 kg at 195 days compared to non-challenged lambs. Four challenged lambs had to be euthanised due to clinical OJD. After this period, the HEM density and ELISA S/P ratios declined, growth rates increased in the challenged lambs up to 482 days after which no HEM were detected and growth rates were equal between challenged and unchallenged groups. The challenged lambs failed to regain equivalent weights over the 820 days being 11 kg lighter {{at the end of the}} study despite having equal body condition scores. The challenged lambs were smaller than the unchallenged lambs both in body height and length with multivariate ANOVA analysis determining the post mortem mean skeletal measurements of the poll to rump length and metacarpal/meta-tarsal bones being 4 % and 5 % shorter, respectively. There were no positive ELISA blood samples or histopathological lesions in any tissues sampled at necropsy from both groups of lambs at the end of the study, suggesting complete cure of the surviving challenged lambs. The findings demonstrated i) that artificial challenge can cause systemic Map infection, ii) systemic infection results in negative growth rates and a loss of body condition, iii) and in addition to the period of retarded growth losses occur from death of some lambs (4 / 18), iv) that the temporary poor weight gain impacted on the final weight, and v) that recovery to systemic Map infection 6 appears to occur in survivors of acute disease. Moreover, it was postulated that the identification of HEM from serial liver biopsies may have the potential to determine the therapeutic efficacy of new anti-mycobacterial drugs (such as thalidomide, Appendix one) or vaccines for preventing systemic Map infection. Chapter seven revisits the histopathological findings described in Chapter five, expanding from the microscopic visual identification of HEM to utilising spectroscopy and hyperspectral image analysis. The aims of this final study included identifying whether a spectral signature for skeletal muscle or liver exists in sheep with Johne’s disease and developing an algorithm that can identify the presence of systemic Map infection in sheep. Ninety five mixed aged ewes, of low body condition score from nine farms were euthanised and OJD was confirmed by histopathology in 10 animals. The liver and transected longissimus dorsi muscle were scanned using a visible light to near infrared (Vis-NIR) detector as well as 200 lamb livers from a slaughter house. The histological identification of HEM was used as a surrogate measure of systemic Map infection with HEM recorded in the 10 ewes with Johne’s disease and none of the 85 ewes without or the 200 lamb livers. There was no histopathological or hyperspectral differences identified for the transected longissimus dorsi muscle in the 95 ewes. However a a computer generated algorithm identified a hyperspectral signature for liver tissue that when applied, blind to the Johne’s disease status of the ewes was able to differentiate all 10 animals with Johne’s disease from the 85 ewes and 200 lambs without. This pilot study suggests that spectroscopy may have potential to be a useful real time tool for the identification of sheep with systemic Map infection at the time of slaughter. In conclusion, disseminated Map infection does occur in sheep with clinical OJD, and meat from these animals can be a source of Map for humans. Meat from healthy sheep or sheep without clinical OJD does not appear to expose consumers to Map. The identification of 7 HEM in liver biopsies has diagnostic value for identifying sheep with clinical OJD. In naturally infected sheep, HEM only appear when Map infection has progressed to clinical OJD. As opposed to high–dose artificial challenge, systemic Map infection under natural challenge conditions appears to require ileal pathology, suggesting different mechanisms for the occurrence of systemic infection in these two challenge types. Examination of serial liver biopsies and the identification of HEM has enabled the investigation of the production loss due to temporary progression and subsequent resolution of Map infection. The final study in this thesis has tested proof of concept for a new real time diagnostic test that has potential to mass screen sheep within abattoirs at point of slaughter using spectroscopy and hyperspectral analysis. However further research is required to validate this spectroscopic test...|$|E
