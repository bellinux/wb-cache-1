DTA systems use detailed travel demand and network supply simulators to synthesize multiple sources of information and perform state estimation and prediction. The demand simulator simulates network-wide demand patterns through time-dependent origin–destination (OD) matrices, and captures the travel choices of individual motorists (e.g. route choice). The supply simulator is usually based on mesoscopic or macroscopic models that represent traffic dynamics using speed-density relationships and queuing theory. (e.g. [19, 20, 42]). Speed-density relationships depend on location-specific parameters, such as type of facility, number of lanes, lane width, slope, surroundings, as well as weather and time of day factors, reflecting different driving behaviors (e.g. experienced drivers during commute periods). In a DTA model, the complex demand-supply interactions are represented by detailed algorithms that estimate current network state, predict future conditions, and generate <b>anticipatory</b> route <b>guidance</b> and control strategies.|$|R

40|$|<b>Anticipatory</b> route <b>guidance</b> {{consists}} of messages, based on traffic network forecasts, that assist drivers' path choice decisions. Guidance is consistent when the forecasts {{on which it}} is based are verified after drivers react to it. This thesis addresses the formulation and development of solution algorithms for the consistent <b>anticipatory</b> route <b>guidance</b> generation (RGG) problem. The thesis proposes a framework for the problem, involving a set of time-dependent variables and their relationships. Variables are network conditions, path splits and guidance messages. Relationships are the network loading map, transforming path splits into network conditions; the guidance map, transforming network conditions into guidance messages; and the routing map, transforming guidance messages into path splits. The basic relationships can be combined into three alternative composite maps that model a guidance problem. Consistent guidance corresponds to a fixed point of a composite map. With stochastic maps, RGG model outputs are stochastic process realizations. In this case, the consistency fixed point corresponds to stationarity of the RGG solution process. Numerical methods for fixed point computation were examined, focusing on approaches that are rigorous and applicable to large-scale problems. Methods included Gibbs sampling for highly stochastic maps; generalizations of functional iteration for deterministic maps; and the MSA and Polyak iterate averaging method for "noisy" (deterministic plus disturbance) maps. A guidance-oriented dynamic traffic simulator was developed to experiment with RGG solution methods. Computational tests using the simulator investigated the use of Gibbs sampling to compute general stochastic process outputs; and examined {{the performance of the}} averaging methods under different model formulations, problem settings and degrees of stochasticity. Gibbs sampling successfully generated realizations from the stationary solution process of a fully stochastic model, but entails considerable computational effort. For noisy problems, the MSA found fixed points in all cases considered. Polyak averaging converged between two and four times faster than the MSA in low or moderate stochasticity problems, and performed comparably to the MSA in other problems. Formulations involving path-level variables converged more quickly than those involving link-level variables. by Jon Alan Bottom. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Two of {{the most}} basic {{problems}} encountered in numerical optimization are least-squares problems and systems of nonlinear equations. The use of more and more complex simulation tools on high performance computers requires solving problems involving an increasingly large number of variables. The main thrust of this thesis the design of new algorithmic methods for solving large-scale instances of these two problems. Although they are relevant in many different applications, we concentrate specifically on real applications encountered in the context of Intelligent Transportation Systems to illustrate their performances. First we propose a new approach for the estimation and prediction of OriginDestination tables. This problem is usually solved using a Kalman filter approach, which refers to both formulation and resolution algorithm. We prefer to consider a explicit least-squares formulation. It offers convenient and flexible algorithms especially designed to solve largescale problems. Numerical results provide evidence that this approach requires significantly less computation effort than the Kalman filter algorithm. Moreover it allows to consider larger problems, likely to occur in real applications. Second a new class of quasi-Newton methods for solving systems of nonlinear equations is presented. The main idea is to generalize classical methods by building a model using more than two previous iterates. We use a least-squares approach to calibrate this model, as exact interpolation requires a fixed number of iterates, and may be numerically problematic. Based on classical assumptions we give a proof of local convergence of this class of methods. Computational comparisons with standard quasi-Newton methods highlight substantial improvements in terms of robustness and number of function evaluations. We derive from this class of methods a matrix-free algorithm designed to solve large-scale systems of nonlinear equations without assuming any particular structure on the problems. We have successfully tried out the method on problems with up to one million variables. Computational experiments on standard problems show that this algorithm outperforms classical large-scale quasi-Newton methods in terms of efficiency and robustness. Moreover, its numerical performances are similar to Newton-Krylov methods, currently considered as the best to solve large-scale systems of equations. In addition, we provide numerical evidence of the superiority of our method for solving noisy systems of nonlinear equations. This method is then applied to the consistent <b>anticipatory</b> route <b>guidance</b> generation. Route guidance refers to information provided to travelers in an attempt to facilitate their decisions relative to departure time, travel mode and route. We are specifically interested in consistent <b>anticipatory</b> route <b>guidance,</b> in which real-time traffic measurements are used to make short-term predictions, involving complex simulation tools, of future traffic conditions. These predictions are the basis of the guidance information that is provided to users. By consistent, we mean that the anticipated traffic conditions used to generate the guidance must be similar to the traffic conditions that the travelers are going to experience on the network. The problem is tricky because, contrarily to weather forecast where the real system under consideration is not affected by information provision, the very fact of providing travel information may modify the future traffic conditions and, therefore, invalidate the prediction that has been used to generate it. Bottom (2000) has proposed a general fixed point formulation of this problem with the following characteristics. First, as guidance generation involves considerable amounts of computation, this fixed point problem must be solved quickly and accurately enough for the results to be timely and of use to drivers. Secondly the unavailability of a closed-form objective function and the presence of noise due to the use of simulation tools prevent from using classical algorithms. A number of simulation experiments based on two system software including DynaMIT a state-of-the-art, real-time computer system for traffic estimation and prediction, developed at the Intelligent Transportation Systems Program of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), have been run. These numerical results underline the good behavior of our large-scale method compared to classical fixed point methods for solving the consistent <b>anticipatory</b> route <b>guidance</b> problem.

30|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, {{the motivation}} {{for which it is}} worth studying compliance with information is strictly related to network effects. In some cases [8, 10], it has been proven that a high level of compliance is required in order for ATIS to be effective. However, the relationship between compliance and reliability of information (with reference to different kinds of information) has often been argued but not in all cases proven. According to widely used definitions, we state herein that the information is reliable when the estimates made by the ATIS are consistent with the travel times the travellers have actually experienced once at destination. This is determined by a combination of forecasting methods from the ATIS side, variability in travel times from the network side and travellers’ experiences. The result is that compliance is not always expected to be high. This difficulty is exacerbated in the case of congested networks by the so-called <b>anticipatory</b> route <b>guidance</b> problem (ARG problem, e.g. [16, 24]). In order to obtain reliable information, the suggestions, based on the estimates of the predicted state of traffic conditions, should consider travellers’ reactions to the information itself. These reactions are however dependent on the actual compliance, and thus even in forecasting models that account for travellers’ reactions 100  % reliability is not expected to be met if compliance behaviour is not fully captured. These complex interactions defend our interest in compliance but are excluded from our experiment, since it is much more useful for studying the respondents’ behaviour to treat reliability as an external parameter. In particular, reliability is the main design parameter of our experiment, since the effects of different reliability levels on compliance with information {{is one of the main}} interests in this work.|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates dynamic {{phenomena}} {{that arise in}} a variety of systems that share similar characteristics. A common characteristic of particular interest in this work is travel time. We wish to address questions of the type: How long does it take a driver to traverse a route in a transportation network? How long does a unit of product remain in inventory before being sold? As a result, our goal is not only to develop models for travel times as they arise {{in a variety of}} dynamically evolving environments, but also to investigate the application of these models in the contexts of dynamic pricing, inventory management, traffic control and route guidance. To address these issues, we develop general models for travel times. To make these models more accessible, we describe them as they apply to transportation systems. We propose first-order and second-order fluid models. We enhance these models to account for spillback and bottleneck phenomena. Based on piecewise linear and piecewise quadratic approximations of the departure or exit flows, we propose several classes of travel time functions. In the area of supply chain, we propose and study a fluid model of pricing and inventory management for make-to-stock manufacturing systems. This model is based on how price and level of inventory affect the time a unit of product remains in inventory. The model applies to non-perishable products. Our motivation is based on the observation that in inventory systems, a unit of product incurs a delay before being sold. This delay depends on the level of inventory of this product, its unit price, and prices of competitors. (Cont.) The model includes joint pricing, production and inventory decisions in a competitive capacitated multi-product dynamic environment. Finally, we consider the <b>anticipatory</b> route <b>guidance</b> problem, an extension of the dynamic user-equilibrium problem. This problem consists of providing messages to drivers, based on forecasts of traffic conditions, to assist them in their path choice decisions. We propose two equivalent formulations that are the first general analytical formulations of this problem. We establish, under weak assumptions, the existence of a solution to this problem. by Soulaymane Kachani. Thesis (Ph. D.)

However, most parents expect their pediatricians to be their prinicipal source of knowledge about their children’s health and about a broad range of other issues as well.

Objective: To explore what mothers of preschoolers recall and understand about growth assessment and nutrition <b>anticipatory</b> <b>guidance</b> provided at their child's most recent well-child visit. METHODS: Qualitative, semistructured telephone interviews were performed with 20 mothers of preschoolers recruited from a Head Start program. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Themes were identified and refined in an iterative process. RESULTS: Three main findings emerged: 1) although mothers generally recalled the use of growth charts and often recalled their child's height and weight percentiles, they were generally unable to articulate the meaning of these percentiles; 2) most mothers stated that their nutrition-related decisions were not influenced by growth chart findings. However, when growth chart findings were interpreted as positive, mothers found them reassuring. Conversely, when growth chart findings were interpreted as negative, mothers discounted the growth chart in favor of other comparisons of growth; 3) a considerable proportion of mothers reported that nutrition was not discussed at the most recent well-child visit, which mothers commonly attributed to a lack of weight or feeding problems for their child. CONCLUSION: Among the low-income mothers studied, growth chart use and findings were memorable but frequently misunderstood, while nutrition-related <b>anticipatory</b> <b>guidance</b> was not consistently recalled.

40|$|Abstract: Severe early {{childhood}} caries (S-ECC) affects 17 % of 2 - 3 year old children in South Australia impacting on their general health and well-being. S-ECC is largely preventable by providing mothers with <b>anticipatory</b> <b>guidance.</b> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) {{are the most}} decisive way to test this, but that approach suffers from near inevitable loss to follow-up that occurs with preventative strategies and distant outcome assessment. We re-examined {{the results of an}} RCT to prevent S-ECC using sensitivity analyses and multiple imputation to test different assumptions about violation of random allocation (1 %) and major loss to follow-up (32 %). Irrespective of any assumptions about missing outcomes, providing expectant mothers with <b>anticipatory</b> <b>guidance</b> during pregnancy and in the child’s first year of life, significantly reduced the incidence of S-ECC at 20 months of age. However, the relative risk of S-ECC varied from 0. 18 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 06 – 0. 52) to 0. 70 (95 % CI: 0. 56 – 0. 88). Also the ‘number needed to treat ’ (NNT) to prevent one case of S-ECC varied 2. 5 -fold: from 8 to 20 women given <b>anticipatory</b> <b>guidance.</b> Multiple imputation provided a best estimate of 0. 25 (95 % CI: 0. 11 – 0. 56) for the relative risk and of 14 (95 % CI: 10 – 33) for the number needed to treat. Avoiding loss to follow-up is crucial in any RCT, but is difficult with preventative health care strategies. Instead of abandoning randomisation in such circumstances, sensitivity analyses and multiple imputation can consolidate the findings of an RCT and add extra value to the conclusions derived from it...|$|E

30|$|Dental caries {{in young}} {{children}} remains a public health problem particularly for children whose families are socioeconomically deprived. A child’s first dental visit should be at approximately 12  months of age, and this should facilitate the provision of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>guidance</b> concerning oral health and dental development to the child’s parents/guardians. Compliance with dietary advice is of key importance, and motivational interviewing shows promise in relation to parents adopting good oral health practices for their children.|$|E
