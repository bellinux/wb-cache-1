40|$|Urbanization is {{accelerating}} worldwide. One of {{the negative}} effects of urbanization is the overloading of the city sewer system. To solve this problem, on-site storm water infiltration proves very promising due to its near natural characteristics and multiple effects on the drainage of stormwater runoff in urban areas. However, the judgment of whether a local area is appropriate to be drained in this way and which infiltration measures are optimal is rather complex and involves analysing a set of influential factors. This judgment depends on not only relevant theoretical considerations, but also a large amount of practical experience and the availability of relevant data, as well. Such a judgment is an unstructured problem and relates to changeable knowledge. To fulfill this task, the so-called <b>expert</b> <b>system,</b> or knowledge-based system, is introduced. One <b>of</b> the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> an <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> is that it provides automation of expert-level judgment.

30|$|Improving forecasting, {{especially}} {{estimating the}} behavior of stock price accuracy, is an important difficult task. Combining several models or using hybrid models {{can be an effective}} way to improve estimating accuracy. With neural networks, it is difficult to analyze the importance of input data and the way the network derives its results. The <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> fuzzy <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> is that they can explain how they derive their results. The major problem with applying fuzzy <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> to the stock market is the difficultly in formulating knowledge of the markets because we ourselves do not completely understand them. In fact, the automatic definition of fuzzy systems can be considered as an optimization or search process. Nowadays, evolutionary algorithms, particularly genetic algorithm, are used for automatic extraction fuzzy <b>expert</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper, it has presented a novel tool to estimate {{the behavior of}} stock price in seven stages. It is the first study on using an approximate fuzzy rule base system and evolutionary strategy with the ability of extracting whole knowledge base <b>of</b> fuzzy <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> for stock price forecasting problems. This tool combines data mining, fuzzy <b>expert</b> <b>system,</b> evolutionary strategy and genetic algorithm. Beginning in three stages, DEFES is equipped with data mining concept. Data mining process includes application of three preprocessing methods: noise filtering, stepwise regression and data clustering. It is used for refining and improving the tool performance. Continued genetic algorithm and evolutionary strategy extract whole knowledge base <b>of</b> a fuzzy <b>expert</b> <b>system.</b> To evaluate the proposed approach, we applied it to stock price data of IBM Corporation which had been used in different papers as the case study. Results have showed that forecasting accuracy of DEFES outperforms the rest of approaches regarding MAPE. So DEFES is able to cope with the fluctuations of stock price values and it {{can be used as a}} suitable tool to simulation behavior of stock price.|$|R

The KATE shell is {{the portion of the}} system which performs the monitoring, diagnosis, and control functions. It is generic {{in the sense that it}} is application independent. This means that the monitoring activity, for instance, will be performed with the same algorithms regardless of the particular physical device being used. The knowledge base is the portion of the system which contains specific functional and behavorial information about the physical device KATE is working with. Work is nearing completion on a project at KSC to interface a Texas Instruments Explorer running a LISP version of KATE with a Generic Checkout System (GCS) test-bed to control a physical simulation of a shuttle tanking system (humorously called the Red Wagon because of its color and mobility). The Autonomous Control System (ACS) project supplements and extends the KATE/GCS project by adding three other major activities. The activities include: porting KATE from the Texas Instruments Explorer machine to an Intel 80386 -based UNIX workstation in the LISP language; rewriting KATE as necessary to run on the same 80386 workstation but in the Ada language; and investigating software and techniques to translate ANSI Standard Common LISP to Mil Standard Ada.
