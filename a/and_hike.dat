5|$|Building {{structure}} of Lam Tin Estate's blocks is standardised by the government. As types 3, 4 and 6 buildings, the 23 towers of Lam Tin Estate were shaped as cuboids and resembled candy-boxes {{standing on a}} knoll. Most buildings were 16-storeys high and housed about 800 units. Each building had an estimated capacity of 3,000 residents and an approximate space allocation at 30ft² per person. Bathrooms and kitchens were combined into one compartment, as were living rooms and bedrooms. Lifts only reached some of the floors. To access the other floors, one needed to exit the lift at a level nearby <b>and</b> <b>hike</b> upstairs or downstairs. On the ground floor beneath the buildings were a variety of shops which served the residents. Although densely packed, the living environment of Lam Tin Estate fostered close relationships in the neighbourhood.|$|E

2500|$|These {{individual}} section camps {{were predominantly}} associated with individual districts within the Chicago Area Council, and the Scouts would form their {{troops in the}} city and board a steamer vessel in Chicago for the adventure across Lake Michigan. In these first years, the Scouts would arrive at the pier in Whitehall, load their gear on trucks, <b>and</b> <b>hike</b> the 4 miles from town to Owasippe. If {{you have a chance to}} visit the White Lake Lighthouse, check out the exhibit about the S.S. Carolina. In the local maritime museum there is an exhibit on the Carolina that features its Owasippe transport years. It was one of the boats bringing Scouts to Owasippe.

[...] This was just a spot on the Pere Marquette railroad where they would stop and drop off the Scouts and their gear.|$|E

They are popular way of refreshing from the summer heat in the Toro Negro State Forest. The forest's [...] "official" [...] pool is accessed via Trail number 6, the La Piscina ("The Pool") trail. To reach trail 6, hikers start out from the forest office/parking area <b>and</b> <b>hike</b> north on route PR-143 about 1/4 mile. Trail 6 {{is located on the}} right hand side of the road. This pool is a river-fed pool. It became deteriorated, in disrepair and closed to public use sometime prior to 2010 and, in February 2013, there were unconfirmed reports that it had been repaired and reopen. In 2008, it was reported that an agreement between DNRA and the local community had been signed whereby the community would help repair the pool. Under an agreement with the government of Puerto Rico, the municipality of Orocovis is the entity responsible for pool maintenance. In any case, this pool opens only during the summer months. The pool's water temperature is very chilled, but refreshing, given the high humidity of the area, particularly in the afternoons. La Piscina is located at 18.1713°N 66.4876°W (...) [...]|$|E
