40|$|Background: Over {{the years}} the EU, the US {{and the rest of}} the world have {{experienced}} several devastating financial crises. As a result of the Great Recession and several accounting scandals the EU-commission added new proposals of regulations. The Commission carried out a proposal to restrict the non-audit services to <b>audit</b> <b>clients</b> with the purpose to achieve improved audit quality and a more competitive market, which was later approved by the European Parliament.   Purpose & Problem:  The purpose of this thesis was to evaluate how non-audit services to <b>audit</b> <b>clients</b> affect the <b>audit</b> quality and with that information evaluate the opinion divergence between the regulators and the practitioners, on providing non-audit services to <b>audit</b> <b>clients</b> and its effect on audit quality. Method: Our intentions were to compare collected evidence and earlier reports with fresh intake of raw data along with statements from several interview subjects from different positions such as the EU-commission and audit firms. By gathering information from both company personnel and state-working staff in the area of auditing, we obtained sufficient information on the thesis empirical findings we did also take part of professional bodies like IFAC and FAR.   Conclusion: Our conclusion is that both regulators and practitioners chose to define audit quality based on their own interests. We believe that this creates an opinion divergence. In order to resolve this conflict of interest, there is a need to agree on a universal definition of audit quality. To be more particular a definition that leave no room for ambiguities and misinterpretation regarding both practitioners and regulators...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{auditors}} providing non-audit services (NAS) {{is one of}} the most debated topics within the accounting profession at present.

Questionnaires were sent out to the top twenty accounting firms and interviews were conducted with the accounting bodies, namely, CPA, ACCA, IIPA, and also with IAASA and the ODCE. The findings suggest that there is some need for change in the area of auditors’ providing NAS. The main findings suggest that more disclosure is required in the annual report and the current rules and regulations are only in part sufficient to prevent the auditor losing independence whilst providing NAS.

40|$|Prior {{research}} suggests that Big 4 auditors provide higher quality audits {{by virtue of their}} large size. Still, the recent reforms mandated by the Sarbanes Oxley Act – by increasing client and auditor incentives for accurate reporting – may have narrowed audit quality differences across auditor groups. In this paper, we examine audit quality for Big 4 and Mid-tier auditors during 2003 - 06 and include clients of other smaller audit firms for comparison purposes. We examine actual audit quality (as proxied by earnings management metrics) as well as perceived audit quality (as proxied by the client- and year-specific eloading and ex ante equity risk premium metrics). We include in our analysis only those Big 4 clients for whom the Mid-tier firms are potentially viable as auditors. Relative to other smaller <b>audit</b> firm <b>clients,</b> we find Big 4 and Mid-tier <b>audit</b> <b>clients</b> to have (1) lower levels of accrual management, (2) higher levels of real earnings management, and (3) higher levels of investor-perceived accruals quality. In each case, we were unable to reject the null that Big 4 and Mid-tier audits are similar. However, we find Big 4 <b>audit</b> <b>clients</b> to have a lower client-specific ex ante equity risk premium relative to both Mid-tier and other smaller <b>audit</b> firm <b>clients.</b> Collectively, our findings indicate that in situations where a Mid-tier auditor is potentially viable, Big 4 clients could utilize a Mid-tier firm without adversely affecting audit quality. Still, the results suggest that Big 4 clients have a lower ex ante cost of equity capital which is likely related to the insurance considerations (“deep pockets”) – rather than the audit quality [...] associated with having a Big 4 auditor.

40|$|Purpose – Auditors' {{employment}} {{with their}} former audit clients {{has been an}} issue of concern to regulators and accounting bodies because of its perceived effect on auditor independence. Little prior research examines this issue {{and the results are}} mixed. This paper is motivated by the lack of research on the impact of certified public accountings (CPAs) employment with former audit clients on auditor independence, particularly in the Asia Pacific region in the post-Enron climate. Design/methodology/approach – This research is the first study of its type in the literature using both qualitative and quantitative analysis. The framework of the study is formed by the identification of gaps in the literature and semi-structured interviews. Two within-subjects independent variables – “auditors of different ranks” (rank factor) and “former auditor's direct prior professional relationship with the client” – and one between-subject independent variable – “Big 4 ” CPAs vs non-Big 4 CPAs – are examined. Mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) are employed to analyze survey responses from 205 “Big 4 ” and 196 “non-Big 4 ” auditors. Findings – The rank factor has a significant influence on the perceptions of auditor independence. Perceived independence is impaired when a senior level professional such as partner or manager joins a former <b>audit</b> <b>client,</b> and revokes an US study conducted in the pre-Enron. Perceived independence is also impaired when the former auditor has a direct prior professional relationship with the former <b>audit</b> <b>client.</b> Results further indicate that when the former manager who has direct prior professional relationship with the client and then joins the <b>audit</b> <b>client,</b> independence is severely impaired.

In particular, we examine the relation between audit fees and business risk for <b>audit</b> <b>clients</b> doing business in developing countries where bribery of top government officials has been an accepted business practice.

40|$|The joint {{provision}} of audit and non-audit services by audit firms to their <b>audit</b> <b>clients</b> has posed {{a threat to}} auditor independence. To mitigate the independence problem, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a regulation (.

We show that partners in an audit firm strategically change the firm's liability-sharing rule. As a consequence, the regulation restores truthful reporting but has an undesirable negative effect on audit effort. The effect of the regulation on the welfare of the economy (defined as the total payoff to both audit firms and their clients) hinges on the tradeoff between the benefit of the regulation, which is derived from the inducement of truthful reporting, and the cost of the regulation, which results from less diligent audit work. We show that the regulation is more likely to increase the welfare in a strong legal regime (where the legal liability cost of auditor litigation is high) than in a weak legal regime. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. postprin...|$|R
