5|$|Archaeological, biogeographical, and {{linguistic}} evidence {{suggest that the}} donkey was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago. The animals were used to help cope with the increased aridity of the Sahara and the Horn of Africa. Genetic evidence finds that the donkey was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> a single ancestor, the Nubian wild ass. Attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some to draw a carriage in England.|$|E
5|$|Ward's {{thesis is}} {{based on the fact that}} the Thyssen panel, so named after its home at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, is {{overwhelmingly}} influenced by Campin, while the contemporaneous and more sophisticated Madonna Standing draws heavily from van Eyck. He finds such a sudden shift unlikely, while also pointing out that this work evidences some technical difficulties that Campin was never to resolve, especially in respect to foreshortening and the rendering of the body beneath the robes. He <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the architectural similarities in Campin's Marriage of Mary, although this may be a matter of influence.|$|E
25|$|Burial mounds {{around the}} common of Corfe Castle {{suggest that the}} area was {{occupied}} from 6000BC. The common <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> a later Celtic field system worked by the Durotriges tribe. Evidence suggests that the tribe co-existed with the Romans in a trading relationship following the Roman invasion c. 50AD.|$|E

25|$|Being {{composed}} {{in an early}} Indo-Aryan language, the hymns must post-date the Indo-Iranian separation, dated to roughly 2000 BC. A reasonable date close {{to that of the}} composition of the core of the Rigveda is that of the Mitanni documents of c. 1400 BC, which contain Indo-Aryan nomenclature. Other evidence <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> a composition close to 1400 BC.|$|E
25|$|Keith, {{as well as}} {{suggesting}} a tie to the myth of Clytie, <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> that of Narcissus (to be found, amongst other ancient sources, in the Metamorphoses of Ovid, like the Clytie tale). The Narcissus story tells of love corrupted by inward-looking selfishness, rather than by jealousy. It may be {{no accident that the}} Youth in the poem has connections to flower-imagery (the Narcissus being the Wild Daffodil).|$|E
25|$|Executive {{dysfunction}} {{does occur}} {{to a minor}} degree in all individuals on both short-term and long-term scales. In non-clinical populations, the activation of executive processes appears to inhibit further activation of the same processes, suggesting a mechanism for normal fluctuations in executive control. Decline in executive functioning is also associated with both normal and clinical aging. In aging populations, the decline of memory processes appears to affect executive functions, which <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the general role of memory in executive functioning.|$|E

25|$|In {{his book}} The Trial of Henry Kissinger, Christopher Hitchens elaborates {{on what he}} saw as the efforts of Kissinger to subvert the {{aspirations}} of independence {{on the part of the}} Bengalis. Hitchens not only claims that the term genocide is appropriate to describe the results of the struggle, but <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the efforts of Henry Kissinger in undermining others who condemned the then ongoing atrocities as being a genocide. He also wrote “Kissinger was responsible for the killing of thousands of people, including Sheik Mujibur Rahman”.|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> local civilian {{opposition to}} the presence of the Force Intervention Brigade. According to Teddy Muhindo Kataliko, president of the Civil Society in Beni Territory, “The population is very hostile to MONUSCO. Firstly because so many people are being killed, but even more so seeing all their arsenal, logistics and soldiers in the area.” This opposition stems from the civilian deaths caused by the Force Intervention Brigade, as well as the failure of the Brigade to eliminate most rebel groups despite long term presence in the region.|$|E
25|$|Peter Griffiths (2011) {{points to}} false claims that Fairtrade {{producers}} get higher prices, the almost universal {{failure to disclose}} the extra price charged for Fairtrade products, to disclose {{how much of this}} actually reaches the developing world, to disclose what this is spent on in the developing world, to disclose how much, if any, reaches farmers, and to disclose the harm that Fairtrade does to non-Fairtrade farmers. He <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the failure to disclose when 'the primary commercial intent' is to make money for retailers and distributors in rich countries.|$|E

25|$|Saiedi <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> another {{translation}} and interpretation of the version in the Báb's letter: the Báb's use the word manahij (paths) in two ways; in one way {{it refers to the}} chapters of the Bayán, and in another way it refers to the entire Bayán and his laws. Saiedi states that the reference to manifesting the eight paths may refer to the distribution of the eight copies of the Bayán that the Báb had sent to Subh-i-Azal, to the eight individuals who are identified in the letter, when the Promised One appears.|$|E
25|$|Nawaz notes how all {{transnational}} {{social movements}} of today, whether European Neo-fascism or Islamism, are extremist in nature, and democracy aspirants {{all over the}} world are left behind. He criticises the idea of political correctness, and the hesitation of democrats in asserting the universality of democratic norms. He <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the political failure of many states in the Muslim world as a contributing factor. According to Nawaz, there is absence of democratic choice in many Muslim-majority countries, which means that their democratic parties often find themselves competing with non-democratic parties, including theocratic and military-backed ones. The political failure of democratic parties is taken as a failure of democracy itself in the Muslim world.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the stegosaurid family tree has been debated for a while. However, {{in two of the}} most extensive cladistics analyses of Stegosauria conducted to date, both Mateus et al. (2009) and Maidment (2010) present similar phylogenetic relationships within Stegosauridae (shown below). The well-resolved phylogenies place the newly discovered long-necked stegosaurid Miragaia as sister taxa to Dacentrurus forming the clade Dacentrurinae. Mateus et al. note that in both Miragaia and Dacentrurus, the cervical rib projects posteriorly and the anterior pubic process is dorsoventrally deep and bears a dorsal projection at its anterior tip in lateral view. Their phylogeny <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> a sister-group relationship between the new clade Dacentrurinae and the genus Stegosaurus, supported by the shared presence of postzygapophyses on cervical vertebrae that are elongate and project posterior to the posterior centrum facet. Dacentrurus was previously considered to be a basal stegosaurid, but the discovery and observation of Miragaia has suggested that it is a derived taxon.|$|E

25|$|According to {{supporters}} of Tibetan independence, Tibet was a distinct nation and state independent between {{the fall of}} the Mongol Empire in 1368 and subjugation by the Qing Dynasty in 1720; and again between {{the fall of the}} Qing Dynasty in 1912 and its incorporation into the PRC in 1951. Moreover, even during the periods of nominal subjugation to the Yuan and Qing, Tibet was largely self-governing. As such, the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) views current PRC rule in Tibet as illegitimate, motivated solely by the natural resources and strategic value of Tibet, and in violation of both Tibet's historical status as an independent country and the right of the Tibetan people to self-determination. It <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> PRC's autocratic and divide-and-rule policies, and assimilationist policies, regarding those as an example of imperialism bent on destroying Tibet's distinct ethnic makeup, culture, and identity, thereby cementing it as an indivisible part of China. After the fall of the Qing Dynasty, both Mongolia and Tibet declared independence and recognized each other as such.|$|E
25|$|The daggernose shark poses little {{danger to}} humans {{due to its}} small size and teeth. This shark is caught in small numbers by {{subsistence}} fishers in Trinidad, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guyana. It also comprises about one-tenth of the catch of a northern Brazil floating gillnet fishery targeting Serra Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus brasiliensis) and Acoupa weakfish (Cynoscion acoupa), which operates in estuaries during the dry season. This shark is often found in markets, but is not highly regarded as a food fish. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Critically Endangered, as it has a limited distribution and is highly susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate. The daggernose shark has declined over 90% {{over the past decade}} off Brazil, and similar declines have likely also occurred elsewhere in its range as fishing pressure in the region continues to grow more intense. The IUCN has urgently recommended the implementation of conservation schemes and the expansion of fishery monitoring for this species. Evidence <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> this species being on the verge of or already in reproductive collapse.|$|E
25|$|Hard disk {{controllers}} (IBM 2844, 3830, among others, and compatibles) {{accept the}} X'02' command, but first cause a seek to cylinder X'0000', and head X'0000', and {{a search for}} record X'01', before executing the sequential read command {{as if it was}} a X'06'. Without this special hard disk controller behavior, device independent IPL would not be possible. On a hard drive, the IPL Text is contained on cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'01' (24 bytes), and cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'02' (fairly large, certainly somewhat more than 3,000 bytes). The volume label is always contained on cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'03' (80 bytes). The volume label always points to the VTOC, with a pointer of the form HHHH (that is, the VTOC must reside within the first 65,536 tracks). The VTOC's Format 4 DSCB defines the extent (size) of the VTOC, so the volume label only needs a pointer to the first track in the VTOC's extent, and as the Format 4 DSCB, which describes the VTOC, is always the very first DSCB in the VTOC, HHHH <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the Format 4 DSCB.|$|E

5000|$|Skeletal traits <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> {{some sort}} of stratification, likely between elites and commoners. It was very clear through bone {{analysis}} that some individuals were well-nourished and tall, while others were significantly shorter and consumed poorer diets. Further, some skull deformation among the well-nourished skeletons <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> an elite class (Roosevelt 1991: 399). Despite the current evidence, only a few individuals have been examined. A more comprehensive, systematic investigation of burials and houses is required to tell whether the differentiation in food production and consumption was based on class or gender (Roosevelt 1991: 403, 417).|$|R
25|$|In addition, as this {{position}} argues that no country gave Tibet diplomatic recognition between 1912 and 1950, {{they say that}} China, under the Republic of China government, continued to maintain sovereignty over the region, {{and the leaders of}} Tibet themselves acknowledged Chinese sovereignty by sending delegates to the following: the Drafting Committee for a new constitution of the Republic of China in 1925, the National Assembly of the Republic of China in 1931, the fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang in 1931, a National Assembly for drafting a new Chinese constitution in 1946, and finally to another National Assembly for drafting a new Chinese constitution in 1948. Finally, some within the PRC considers all movements aimed at ending Chinese sovereignty in Tibet, starting with British attempts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, to the CTA today, as one long campaign abetted by malicious Western imperialism aimed at destroying Chinese integrity and sovereignty, thereby weakening China's position in the world. The PRC <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> what it calls the autocratic and theocratic policies of the government of Tibet before 1959, as well as its renunciation of South Tibet, claimed by China as a part of historical Tibet occupied by India, as well as the Dalai Lama's association with India, and as such claims the CTA has no moral legitimacy to govern Tibet.|$|E
25|$|Chomsky's {{political}} writings {{have largely}} {{been focused on the}} two concepts of ideology and power, or the media and state policy. One of Chomsky's best-known works, Manufacturing Consent, dissects the media's role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies, across the political spectrum, while marginalizing contrary perspectives. Chomsky claims that this 'free-market' version of censorship is more subtle and difficult to undermine than the equivalent propaganda system that was present in the Soviet Union. As he argues, the mainstream press is corporate owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests. Although acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the choice of topics and issues featured in the mass media, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions that are expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state's ideology. He states that, although the mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part. As evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators. He <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> examples of important news stories that have been ignored by U.S. mainstream media because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the U.S. state: For instance, it ignored the murder of Black Panther Fred Hampton with possible FBI involvement, the massacres perpetrated in Nicaragua by the U.S.-funded Contras, and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths while ignoring the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in the conflict between those two nations.|$|E
500|$|The biblical {{roots of}} this Catholic doctrine, {{according}} to the founder, are in the phrase [...] "God created man to work" [...] (Gen 2:15) and Jesus's long life as an ordinary carpenter in a small town.
