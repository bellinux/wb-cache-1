40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{evaluate}} the performance and constraints of the micro-finance institutions and conditions for poverty reduction in Tanzania. In order to fulfil this purpose the authors have used institutional theory combined with traditional neo-classic micro theory. The National Poverty Eradication Strategy was formed in Tanzania in 1998 with a long-term objective {{of the government to}} reduce the poverty in the country. The objective more specific, was to reduce poverty with 50 per cent by the year of 2010 and eradicate poverty by the year of 2025. The authors have developed a number of factors for efficient micro-finances, if these conditions are met the micro-finances are presumed to be sustainable and useful. A field research survey will encompass interviews with micro- finance institutitions in micro-finance non-governmental organisations, registered commercial banks, registered non bank financial institutions and other important influential organisations. The conclusion of thesis is that the micro-financing is a good tool for of reducing poverty, even if it is not completely efficient today. The micro-finance institutions have not succeeded in reaching out to the people in most need of the credits, the vulnerable poor. It is only the relatively poor already in business that are accepted as borrowers while new business starters, who <b>are</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> more need of financing support that are not accepted.

40|$|Our actual {{tutorials}} led us {{to build}} an Epreuve collective de rythme (Collective Rhythm Test). It is a test of identification and of recognition, after audition, of rhythmical patterns that are intensive and/or temporal, represented graphically, be as <b>are,</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> situation of multiple choices. The test applies to subjects, boys and girls, aged 7 to 12 years old. The study of the test permits {{to bring out the}} metrical qualities. At the opportunity of this first study, we were able to indicate some new constats as well as already expressed ones in anterior observations; also, we have formulated some hypothesis on some characteristics of rhythmical patterns and of the rhythmical function, also on the influence of the first one in the rythmical performance. Here are some main statements. If it does not exist any difference between the efficiency of girls and boys, there is a very significant one between the ages (7 - 8 years old; 9 years old; 10 - 12 years old). This fact can be observed, also, by some difficulty index progressively more high in one group of age to another, to most of the patterns presented. On the other hand, with the patterns of a bivalent complexity (intensity and duration), we observe one kind uniformity of efficiency between the ages, except if the pattern is very simple, although there is tendency to a better efficiency amongst the oldest ones. Concerning again the characteristics of patterns, it happens that the symétrie or asymétrie quality of the rhythmical pattern does not influence the level of diffi- quality of the rythmical pattern does not influence the level of diffistriking-groups. On the other hand, in the situation of multiple choices, for the recognition of and audible pattern, it appears that some characteristics of the " distractors " render more or less easy the récognitive act. Another observation concerns the spatio-temporal situation, and their number, of the strong intensity of the strikings. The difficulty index of one pattern would be function of these two parameters. Finally, from our study, it is brought out that, if there is a continuum of the rhythmical function, this one presents a character of polyvalency that manifests in the levels of different efficiency at each age. Our test permits to observe three capacities, nevertheless in functional liaison one another: intensive rhythm, temporal rhythm and bivalent (mixed) rhythm. In this manner, we reach a conclusion of Paul Fraisse (28) : there are many rhythmical activities that command, for their realisation, some appropriate abilities. Ruel Pierre H.
