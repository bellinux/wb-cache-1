40|$|The {{topic of}} this diploma thesis is the {{variability}} of the approach duration of commercial aircraft. The variability of this flight phase should be tightened to reduce time-buffers in flight schedules with the intention to reduce costs. Therefore, {{the reasons for the}} variability are analysed in this work. To reduce the complexity of this problem the approach of a single aircraft in the <b>aerodrome</b> <b>area</b> is considered and all influencing factors are analysed separately. Those factors that create variability are collected and it is estimated how strong they influence the time of approach and contribute to a variability of flight times. Furthermore, some exemplary calculations of the duration of an approach are made {{with the aid of a}} trajectory calculator. Thus, the result of this thesis is a wide overview of factors that influence the approaching time as well as qualitative and quantitative estimations about the impact these factors have. The conclusion of the analysis is that strong drivers for variability are characterised by their weak predictability. But also in the future those factors are not sufficiently predictable to consider them appropriately in the flight schedule. Nevertheless, for reduction of variability solutions are required, that compensate the effects when a delay factor suddenly appears and lead to constant flight times...|$|E
40|$|The article {{introduces}} the general solution – to regulate air traffic {{flow through the}} implementation of a set of operational procedures and automated processes for tactical airspace planning and collaborative decision-making (AMAN, DMAN, CDM, A-CDM). The specific solution – to unite all airport operators in gross productivity is suggested. It gives them a single image of the air and ground space and the decision-making effectiveness. The acceptance rate of loaded aerodromes depends on the ability of ATS units at these aerodromes providing approach, arrival and departure for the required airspace capacity of the <b>aerodrome</b> <b>area.</b> The basis of module is a manual procedure, in which the air traffic controller arranges departures or arrivals in real time. Furthermore, there are problems that lead to sub-optimal control decisions especially in taxi procedures planning for departure and holding arrival/departure. According to the experience of airports workload in Europe, the optimal decision-making is successful implementation of new operational procedures and automated processes for tactical airspace planning and collaborative decisionmaking (AMAN, DMAN, CDM, A-CDM). Arrival Manager (AMANs) systems are primarily designed to provide automated sequencing support for the ATCOs handling traffic arriving at an airport, continuously calculating arrival sequences and times for flights, taking into account the locally defined landing rate, the required spacing for flights arriving to the runway. AMAN system can {{be an integral part of}} the A-CDM process for interested operators. Departure Manager (DMAN) is a planning system to improve departure flows at airports. Nowadays, the information on airport operations and aircraft readiness is used partly when ATMF is planning the traffic flow throughout the entire ATM system. The most important decision is the information exchange between the interested operators who are criticized for achieving performance indicators for the busiest airports. Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) and Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) both contribute to solve all these problems. </p...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} ground collisions between an aircraft and obstacles (including other aircraft) on the ramp and taxiway regions of an aireld. A safety study is conducted by looking at current operating procedures and analysing accident statistics and reports. An onboard non-collaborative system for large transport aircraft is proposed and its main requirements and performance characteristics are discussed. The main requirement is to detect and track generic obstacles around an aircraft during taxi manoeuvres. The suitability of computer vision to the application of interest of this work is investigated through comparison with other candidate sensor technologies and computer vision, using visible cameras, is selected as the preferred technology. A study of dierent optical solutions is carried out and stereo vision {{is considered to be}} the most suitable choice. Two locations on the aircraft are considered for camera installation and the installation of a stereo vision system on each wingtip is chosen. Algorithms are implemented for the dierent processing blocks of the stereo vision system. These comprise calibration, rectication, correspondence, reconstruction, detection, clustering, and tracking algorithms. For each process, existing methods and techniques are reviewed and the most appropriate ones are selected, modied and improved {{in order to meet the}} specic requirements of this application. The values of several parameters of each algorithm are found experimentally using synthetic data and each algorithm is tested individually before being integrated with the rest of the system. Overall system performance is evaluated by testing for positional accuracy, generic obstacle detection and tracking capabilities, and sensitivity to calibration errors. Testing is conducted for a range of realistic conict scenarios, under dierent illumination, visibility, and image noise conditions. Both synthetic images and real images are used. The results of both sets of images are compared and these suggest that the stereo vision system developed in this research has the potential to reduce wingtip collisions and can therefore improve safety and situational awareness in <b>aerodrome</b> <b>areas.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Winter {{weather is}} a decisive factor {{affecting}} the daily {{course of action}} at airports and causing delays or even safety hazards. Snow covered or iced <b>aerodrome</b> movement <b>areas</b> or aircraft require an initiation of counteractions on time. In order to minimize economic loss and to maintain safety, winter weather situations within an investigation area around an airport have to be detected and forecasted as precisely as possible. At the Department of Transport Meteorology of the German Aerospace Center’s (DLR) Institute of Atmospheric Physics the winter weather nowcasting system WHITE (Winter Hazards In Terminal Environment) has been developed kindly supported by Munich Airport operations. Designed as an automated system WHITE assimilates multiple real-time data sources and assesses problematic winter weather aspects like the differentiation between snow and liquid precipitation, the identification of freezing precipitation and icing plus the rating of surface conditions. The innovative approach of WHITE, combining critical parameters for different predefined winter weather scenarios by means of Fuzzy Logic, classifying hazardous regions and generating winter weather objects, enables the determination of precipitation type and hazard’s intensity...|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} secured for RAAF use in December 1940 under the {{provisions}} of National Security (General) Regulations, but the existing airfield was inadequate and the Air Board set about acquiring more land to extend runways and facilities. The <b>aerodrome</b> covered an <b>area</b> of approximately 355 acres comprising the civil aerodrome on State land vested in the trusteeship of Maryborough City Council (133 acres), several holdings owned by the Council (84 acres), land held by 15 different private owners and public roads (138 acres). The land acquired was partially developed and included a sawmill, service station and several dairies. £257,928 was allocated for buildings, construction works, engineering services, furniture and fittings. By April 1941 the land was being cleared and runways and buildings constructed. The training school was opened 18 September 1941 and the first intake was on November 16 when work was still being carried out.|$|R

Before {{the end of the}} year, the 235 Squadron of the Royal Air Force's Coastal Command was able to sink a German submarine using its contingent on Terceira. By the beginning of 1944, 1400 U.S. troops and 1700 tonnes of equipment had also arrived in Angra and Praia da Vitória, in order to expand and reinforce the runway at Lajes. This included the 928 Engineering Regiment of the U.S. Air Force (17 January), and the 95 Battalion of the U.S. Navy's Seabee construction corp (19 January). Later the Americans signed an accord to construct an aerodrome on the island of Santa Maria (28 November 1944). This was done under the guidance of Pan American airlines, as the Portuguese, not wanting to arouse the wrath of the Nazi Germany, only accepted the project {{on the grounds that it}} was a civilian facility. The construction began in 1944, in conjunction with the erection of a company hospital that served to provide medical assistance to U.S. troops hurt in the European theatre of operations.|$|R
