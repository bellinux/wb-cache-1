25|$|On December 1, 1598, Juan de Zaldívar, Oñate's nephew, reached Acoma with 20–30 men and peacefully traded {{with them}} and had to wait some days for their order of ground corn. On December 4th, Zaldívar went with 16 armored men to Acoma {{to find out about}} the corn. Zutacapan met them and {{directed}} them to the homes with the corn. Zaldívar's people then divided into groups to collect the corn. The traditional oral Acoma narrative tells that a group attacked some Acoma women leading Acoma warriors to retaliate. The Spanish documents do not report an attack on the women <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> division of the men was a reaction to Zutacapan's plan to kill Zaldívar's party. The Acoma killed 12 of the Spaniards including Zaldívar. Five men escaped although one died from jumping over the citadel leaving four to escape with the remaining camp.|$|E

It was originally going to be named [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast {{to feel as if}} all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment ("thou shall not steal"), {{which is one of the}} Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that [...] "whenever people come up to me <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this , where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences." ...|$|E

He would go further, <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> legislature and system of representation possessed the full and entire confidence of the country. [...] He would go still further, and say, that if at the present moment he had imposed upon him the duty of forming a legislature for any country [...] he did not mean to assert that he could form such a legislature as they possessed now, for the nature of man was incapable of reaching such excellence at once. [...] s long as he held any station in the government of the country, he should always feel it his duty to resist [...] measures, when proposed by others.|$|E
500|$|The {{residents}} of Kadalpur village however challenged the anti-corruption narrative in the media, <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> suspension order was justified. They even threatened to protest {{if she is}} reinstated. They said that the mosque was being built on gram sabha land and they had got the panchayat's approval, adding that they were unaware about seeking permission for it. The construction of the mosque was started in 2011, hence they questioned the delayed response of the authorities. Stressing on Nagpal's [...] "high-handedness" [...] and getting the police to demolish it, they said they requested more time to obtain the construction permission, which she rejected. On the District Magistrate's report to the UP government, they claimed {{that he did not}} contact them or any of the panchayat officials. They said that donations for the construction of temples and mosques were given by everyone, and they aim to re-build the mosque. Dhirendra Singh, spokesperson for the Uttar Pradesh Congress party, said that the villagers were not aware of the Supreme Court rulings and it was the duty of the administration to direct them into getting permission and at least stop the construction temporarily. The majority of the villagers are Muslims and the rest are Hindus, and there is a minimal threat for communal violence there.|$|E

2500|$|In Kibbutz life, group {{pressure}} to conform is particularly strong.

Several kibbutz-raised children look back <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> communal system stifled ambition; others say that bright children were nonetheless encouraged. Bruno Bettelheim had predicted that kibbutz education would yield mediocrity: [...] " [...] will not be leaders or philosophers, will not achieve anything in science or art." [...] However, it has been noted that although kibbutzim comprise only 5% of the Israeli population, surprisingly large numbers of kibbutzniks become teachers, lawyers, doctors, and political leaders.|$|E

2500|$|Movie {{production}} incentives are tax benefits offered on a state-by-state basis throughout the United States to encourage in-state film production. [...] These incentives came {{about in the}} 1990s {{in response to the}} flight of movie productions to other countries such as Canada. [...] Since then, states have offered increasingly competitive incentives to lure productions away from other states. [...] The structure, type, and size of the incentives vary from state to state. [...] Many include tax credits and exemptions, and other incentive packages include cash grants, fee-free locations, or other perks. [...] Proponents of these programs point to increased economic activity and job creation as justification for the credits. [...] Others argue that the cost of the incentives outweighs the benefits <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> money goes primarily to out-of-state talent rather than in-state cast and crew members.|$|E
2500|$|These {{discussions were}} {{reported}} to the House of Commons by Thorneycroft, leading to a storm of protest. Air Commodore Sir Arthur Vere Harvey pointed out that while Skybolt had suffered five test failures, Polaris had thirteen failures in its development. He went on to state [...] "that some of us on this side, {{who want to see}} Britain retain a nuclear deterrent, are highly suspicious of some of the American motives... <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British people are tired of being pushed around". Liberal Party leader Jo Grimond asked: [...] "Does not this mark the absolute failure of the policy of the independent deterrent? Is it not the case that everybody else in the world knew this, except the Conservative Party in this country? Is it not the case that the Americans gave up production of the B52, which was to carry Skybolt, nine months ago?" ...|$|E

We determine this case to see what the rule of law ought to be if an employer acts on reasonable, substantiated information, but is wrong." [...] Bisbee suggested that the Seventh Circuit had perhaps used [...] "language that was broader than it needed to", to which O'Connor responded that it might need to be sent back since even he declined to defend their legal theory. [...] "It {{seems to me that you}} can affirm the judgment <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> legal test employed by the Seventh Circuit was not altogether correct," [...] he proposed.|$|E

2500|$|About climate change, Jensen said in December 2008 that [...] "we can {{see that}} climate changes are {{happening}}, {{but they have been}} happening {{for as long as the}} world has existed. The question is whether they are man-made or not, or whether they are dangerous or not. Just some 30 years ago, all these scientists said that the world was getting colder, and now they have changed their mind <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world is getting warmer.

In January 2010 she attacked the IPCC, accusing the report from the panel of being based on fraudulent data.

2500|$|Detractors of Mormonism {{have often}} alleged that Smith, in whose {{time and place}} the King James Version was the only {{available}} English translation of the Bible, simply failed to grasp {{the fact that the}} Elijah of the Old Testament and the Elias of the New Testament are the same person. Latter-day Saints deny this <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> difference they make between the two is deliberate and prophetic. The names Elias and Elijah refer to one who prepares the way for the coming of the Lord. This is applicable to John the Baptist coming to prepare the way for the Lord and His baptism; it also refers to Elijah appearing during the transfiguration to prepare for Jesus by restoring keys of sealing power. Jesus then gave this power to the Twelve saying, [...] "Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." ...|$|E

[...] "Our ardor had cooled a little by the time we got to drive the cars— then we went nuts all over again. The new rear suspension, the new softer spring rates in front, the bigger brakes, the addition of some more power, all these factors had us driving around like idiots— zooming around the handling loop dragging with each other, standing on the brakes— until we had to reluctantly turn the car over to some other impatient journalist... The '65 Corvair is an outstanding car. It doesn't go fast enough, but we love it." ...|$|E
