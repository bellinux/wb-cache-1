Despite what it appears on camera, Flannery was not completely topless, as she was wearing pasties. The scene was shot several times; Flannery admitted that the shooting was excruiating <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> they had been shooting the one scene for [...] "14 hours". To preserve Flannery's modesty, the series' monitors were shut off and the memory card for the digital camera was removed. Carell actually took pictures during the Christmas party shoot. All of the photos were released online.|$|E
500|$|They {{thought of}} using David Glen Eisley's song [...] "Sweet Victory" [...] {{for the final}} act. He said [...] "It was {{different}} than what we were looking for, {{but it was so}} amazing that we knew we had to use it. So we boarded the sequence to the music, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> such a better ending than any song we could have written on our own." [...] The writers gave it a freeze-frame shot for the ending. Greenblatt's favorite part was director Springer's drawings of Patrick on the electric drums and SpongeBob saying, [...] "It's the thrill of one more kill" [...] (an excerpt from [...] "Sweet Victory"). [...] The live action Bubble Bowl crowd is footage from a United States Football League game featuring the Memphis Showboats and the Tampa Bay Bandits.|$|E

500|$|The {{couple were}} {{separated}} {{for long periods}} at a time, as Dash recalled that Aaliyah continuously shot films and would be gone for months often to come back shortly and continue her schedule. Dash was also committed to [...] "his own thing", which did not make matters any better. Despite this, they were understanding that {{the time they had}} together was special. Dash remembered they would [...] "be {{in a room full of}} people talking to each other <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> everyone was listening but it would be just us. It would be like we were the only ones in the room". Dash always felt their time together was essential and Aaliyah was the person he was interested in being with, which is why, as he claimed, they had begun speaking about engagement. The relationship was mentioned in the lyrics of Jay-Z's remix to her song [...] "Miss You", released after her death.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the band}} members have {{expressed}} their dissatisfaction with All Hope Is Gone and {{is considered to be}} their least favorite Slipknot album. Feeling discontent over the record's production process, Root said, [...] "it felt a little bit rushed. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we were trying to do things just to appease a schedule, which I didn't really like." [...] Root was particularly disappointed with the record's producer, Dave Fortman, and said, [...] "Dave Fortman really helped me appreciate Rick Rubin as a producer. [...] wasn't able to get nine people together on the same page and, to me, that's {{the most important thing in}} making a Slipknot record." [...] Conversely, Jordison said, [...] "It's finally the record that I've wanted Slipknot to sound like." [...] He went on to compliment Fortman's ear for tone, and considered All Hope Is Gone to be the band's best album. All Hope Is Gone was mixed by Colin Richardson in Miloco's The Engine Room studio in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with New York Magazine, Matsoukas explained her response to Beyoncé's proposal: [...] "I was like, 'Let's get into the toxic world and what we really do that is so damaging to ourselves, {{and use it as}} a microcosm for our society'. Obviously, those ideas don't just live in the pageant world; they live in our world. And that's what the song is about. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we had to take it there to make it have meaning, because otherwise it would be a superficial, preachy kind of song and visual." [...] A scene from the clip which depicts Beyoncé preparing plastic surgery, consuming diet pills and vomiting, was initially excluded from the video's final cut. However, Beyoncé decided to include the scene to fulfill her role in the clip's premise. Another scene featuring Beyoncé drowning in water while the beauty contest's host questions her life aspirations, was originally intended to depict her falling onstage. However, the scene failed to surface because of time constraints.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard, Rivera spoke about the song saying [...] "I wrote the song {{at the beginning of}} the summer along with some other songs… and this song just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a really good end-of-summer song, I wanted to get a feature on <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> Sean's swag and his vibe would just really fit this well, and I was right." ...|$|R
500|$|The track [...] "Old Age", whose organ intro was {{featured}} on the band's cover of [...] "Credit In The Straight World" [...] from Live Through This, was revealed to have originally written by Kurt Cobain; Love stated in a 1997 interview that [...] "Old Age" [...] was [...] "partly someone else's composition. It's something somebody {{had a little bit}} of and I said 'let me have the rest of it' and I wrote this thing in it and tried to make it goth. I found it, wrote it, and recorded it the same night." [...] It was later revealed that a version of the song was recorded by Nirvana during the Nevermind (1991) recording sessions, but Cobain threw the song out, later giving the melody to Love, who rearranged musical pieces and rewrote the lyrics. Two live cover versions were included on the album: [...] "Season of the Witch" [...] by Donovan, and [...] "He Hit Me (<b>And</b> <b>It</b> <b>Felt</b> <b>Like</b> a Kiss)", which was written by Carole King and recorded by The Crystals in the 1960s. Love referred to it as a [...] "feminist anthem" [...] after performing it during MTV Unplugged in 1995.|$|E
500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{features}} {{the deaths of}} Patricia and Jimmy, who were both consumed by walkers. Alongside {{the deaths of the}} aforementioned characters, the episode's script initially called for the deaths of Hershel, as well as Shane Walsh and Randall, both of whom had died in the previous installment. Since Kirkman felt {{that there was a lot}} of potential development in Hershel, his death was scrapped from the script. Although plans to write off the character commenced earlier in the season, Mazzara opined that his hypothetical death would have carried no emotional resonance. [...] "The plan was always to whack Hershel, and I actually told Scott Wilson, 'Thanks for everything you've done, but in the next script we're going to kill off your character.' We started writing that <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> Hershel's death was playing as a plot device and we were getting no emotional resonance. It was just playing as a gratuitous death. This was one of those examples where we won't play a shocking death for the sense of death; we have to get something out of it. We got nothing out of it. If you look at the shot of Hershel looking back and seeing that barn burning and his farm completely lost to the zombies, that shot was well worth it because we see the farm was really a character and you can only see that through Hershel's eyes. So it was the right call to keep him alive." ...|$|E
500|$|Hill {{spent four}} months {{designing}} and seven months building another home-built dragster called the Double Dragon. The machine had two engines, with each engine having its own ring gear and pinion, clutch, and driveshaft. He used four rear racing slick tires in open competitions for faster passes, and two rear slicks in match competitions to produce smokier passes. The machine ripped up {{the starting line}} at the 1961 NHRA Nationals at Indianapolis. In 1962, Hill ran [...] two years after Chris Karamesines had the first [...] pass and two years before Don Garlits had the first official [...] rpass. A speed or e.t. record is first certified official after it is backed up by a different pass within one percent. Hill built his first Top Fuel dragster in 1963 using a Pontiac engine. He had nearly completed a jet-engine powered ultralight dragster in 1963 when the NHRA outlawed all aircraft engines. He built two more Top Fuel Hemi-powered dragsters before he had an engine fire at Green Valley Race City in 1966. [...] "It {{was one of those}} fireballs that you couldn't see through," [...] Hill said. [...] "I locked up the brakes, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I needed to turn the wheel to the left, but for some reason, I didn't. I had to do something that was counterintuitive, and it spooked me." [...] Hill had managed to steer straight down a course that was lined with trees. Hill had been using the Double Dragon to win matches, which were used to finance his Top Fuel dragster. The Double Dragon had been destroyed in a wreck two months before this fire. The fire tapped his finances and his resolve to drag race.|$|E

500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the segment Bender stated, [...] "The big climactic cave sequence was hugely complex, and although it's very scary that this really terrifying thing is happening to our characters, {{at the end of the}} day I think the emotion from what we are experiencing is hopefully going to be the shock that people will stay with," [...] referring to Hodor's implied death. In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but one of the nice things was they let Isaac wrap me. He got to come over and say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a little group of us together <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> our little group was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just no way she can stop and consider logically what's happening. If you have an army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going to be thinking one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] It was interesting, having the challenge of creating that adrenaline and fear and sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult. But it was an exciting challenge, to constantly inject the energy those characters must be feeling in that moment." ...|$|E

[...] Times James Poniewozik had mixed feelings for the flashbacks, but enjoyed Ben's character development. [...] Nikki Stafford of Wizard [...] "enjoyed" [...] the [...] "interesting" [...] episode, although [...] "not nearly as much" [...] as the previous episode. [...] She rejoiced at the return of her [...] "favorite Other" [...] Tom (M.C. Gainey) and wrote that [...] "Locke {{used to be one}} of [...] favorite characters, but now he's a [...] ". [...] Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones stated that [...] "the episode came together nicely in the end, with an expected twist and a snog, although for a great part it bordered on tedium. [...] Juliet is a character who simply isn't interesting enough to fully sustain one's attention over a flashback. [...] She's been so peripheral and irrelevant over this season, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a token gesture to foreground her at last. [...] There was a nice pay off though, with a long awaited smooch between her and Jack." [...] Daniel of TMZ graded the episode as a [...] "C+"; however, he wrote that [...] "the Ben/Locke scenes were great and Juliet in a bikini did not disappoint." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell [...] was [...] "not impressed with Jack and Juliet's chemistry" [...] and found their kiss [...] "unconvincing". [...] Martell commended Emerson's acting, Ben's one-liners and his [...] "too funny for words" [...] casual greeting to Hurley and Sawyer {{at the end of the}} episode after he is released from captivity. [...] The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter thought that [...] "this was another great episode [...] could have lived up to last week's episode, but there was still a lot of solid character development." ...|$|E

6000|$|He still {{resisted}} her, but {{her hand}} felt very warm and comforting--it {{was such a}} large, warm, protecting hand. So pleasant did it feel that after a little while he began to move his hand up her beautiful, soft, white arm until it touched her hair. For her hair was unbound and loose; it was dark, and finer than the finest spun silk, and fell all over her shoulders and down {{her back to the}} stone she sat on. He let his fingers stray in and out among it; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the soft, warm down that lines a little bird's nest to his skin. Finally, he touched her neck and allowed his hand to rest there, it was such a soft, warm neck. At length, but reluctantly, for his little rebellious heart was not yet wholly subdued, he raised his eyes to her face. Oh, how beautiful she was! Her love and eager desire to win him had flushed her clear olive skin with rich red colour; out of her sweet red lips, half parted, came her warm breath on his cheek, more fragrant than wild flowers; and her large dark eyes were gazing down into his with such a tenderness in them that Martin, seeing it, felt a strange little shudder pass through him, and scarcely knew whether to think it pleasant or painful. [...] "Dear child, I love you so much," [...] she spoke, [...] "will you not call me mother?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{captain had}} not made {{more than two or}} three strokes after {{speaking}} when his right hand struck against something hard, just below the surface of the water. He involuntarily grasped it. It was immovable, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a tree, a few inches in diameter, standing perpendicularly in the lake. Wondering what this could be, he took hold of it with his other hand, and finding that it supported him, he let his feet drop, when, to his surprise, he found that they rested on something with a rounded surface, and the idea instantly came into his mind that it was a submerged tree, the trunk lying horizontally, from which this upright branch projected. This might be as good a resting-place as the rock to which he had been going, and standing on it, with his head well out of the water, he turned to speak to Ralph. At that moment his feet slipped from the slimy object on which he stood, and he fell backward into the water, still grasping, however, his upright support. But this did not remain upright more than an instant, but yielded to his weight, and the end of it which he held went down with him. As he sank, the captain, in his first bewilderment, did not loosen his grasp upon what had been his support, and which still prevented him from sinking rapidly. But in a moment his senses came to him, he let go, and a few downward strokes brought him to the surface of the water. Then he struck out for the point of rock for which he had been aiming, and he was soon mounted upon it.|$|E
