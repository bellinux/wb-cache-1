2500|$|Salle des fêtes : Near Haras and the Paul Lignon Stadium, {{the hall}} of [...] opened on 7 January 2012, by its designer, Emmanuel Nebout and {{political}} representatives. A futuristic and original architecture, it marks the total break between the historical centre and the new district. It has the distinction of offering a large discovery area <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>configuration</b> allows it to accommodate with its facilities (dressing rooms, locker rooms, stage, audio-visual, widescreen) of fairs, exhibitions, festivals and events by associations and businesses. In this room, is juxtaposed another (which can be split into two). It {{can serve as a}} dressing room or bar, or even of meeting room. Finally, on the floors, three meeting rooms are available. The entire building is in synergy and complementary to the restructuring and enlargement of the Paul Lignon Stadium, and more broadly with the multiplex, and the museum, to meet economic or cultural events.|$|E
2500|$|German air {{supremacy}} at night was also now under threat. British night-fighter operations {{out over the}} Channel were proving successful. This was not immediately apparent. The Bristol Blenheim F.1 carried four [...] machine guns which lacked the firepower easily to shoot down a Do 17, Ju 88 or Heinkel He 111. The Blenheim had only a small speed advantage to overhaul a German bomber in a stern-chase. Added to the fact an interception relied on visual sighting, a kill was most unlikely even in the conditions of a moonlit sky. The Boulton Paul Defiant, despite its poor performance during daylight engagements, was a much better night fighter. It was faster, able to catch the bombers <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>configuration</b> of four machine guns in a turret could (much like German night fighters in 1943–1945 with Schräge Musik) engage the German bomber from beneath. Attacks from below offered a larger target, compared to attacking tail-on, {{as well as a}} better chance of not being seen by the crew (so less chance of evasion), as well as greater likelihood of detonating its bomb load. In subsequent months a steady number of German bombers would fall to night fighters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} an {{overview}} about floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) including operating conditions, property and {{applicability of the}} barge, tension-leg, and spar floating platforms is described. The spar-floating offshore wind turbines (S-FOWT) have advantages in deepwater and their preliminary design, numerical modeling tools and integrated modeling are reviewed. Important conclusions about the nacelle and blade motions, tower response, effects of wind and wave loads, overall vibration and power production of the S-FOWT are summarized. Computationally-simplified models with acceptable accuracy are necessary for feasibility and pre-engineering studies of the FOWT. The design needs modeling and analysis of aero-hydro-servo dynamic coupling of the entire FOWT. This paper also familiarizes authors with FOWT <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>configurations</b> <b>and</b> modeling approaches...|$|R
