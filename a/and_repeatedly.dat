He fled into the woods, and did not reach Fort Edward until 12 August.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior scenes to be re-written to be shot inside. Other scenes were shot with a large tarp draped over the actors. Due {{to the fact that}} the rainfall was audible in the background, Corman used the film's score and an assortment of sound effects to drown out the noise. The first scene shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The tree was home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over the actors <b>and</b> <b>repeatedly</b> bit them.|$|E

Hamilton apologised after the race for 'tricking' Massa into the move. Albers, in the sole remaining Spyker, retired on lap nine with a gearbox fire.|$|E
5|$|Ferens {{remained}} a modest man; he saw giving {{as a moral}} duty <b>and</b> <b>repeatedly</b> declined offers of ennoblement. In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster is right in assuming that I am already well acquainted with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this is not the first time I have been associated with him in this manner, and though I know the last thing that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} his {{athletic}} record and remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired {{a reputation as a}} clumsy, likable, and simple-minded Everyman. An incident in 1975, when he tripped while exiting Air Force One in Austria, was famously <b>and</b> <b>repeatedly</b> parodied by Chevy Chase, cementing Ford's image as a klutz. Pieces of Ford's common Everyman image have also been attributed to Ford's inevitable comparison to Nixon, as well as his perceived Midwestern stodginess and self-deprecation.|$|E

When Isa appeared before the city, he waited {{a few days before}} the ditch <b>and</b> <b>repeatedly</b> offered amnesty. Then his troops laid a few doors over the ditch and entered Medina, where Muhammad and his remaining 300 supporters fell fighting on 6 December 762.

5|$|LeMond had to {{keep his}} eye on his {{teammate}} and rival throughout the race.

LeMond later stated the 1986 Tour was the most difficult and stressful race of his career.|$|E
5|$|Model {{first came}} to Hitler's {{attention}} before World War II, but their relationship did not become especially close until 1942.

However, their relationship had broken down {{by the end of the}} war after Model was defeated at the Battle of the Bulge. In April 1945, with the Third Reich's defeat imminent, Model committed suicide rather than be captured and stand trial for war crimes.|$|E
