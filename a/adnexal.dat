25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of ectopic pregnancy include increased hCG, vaginal bleeding (in varying amounts), sudden lower abdominal pain, pelvic pain, a tender cervix, an <b>adnexal</b> mass, or <b>adnexal</b> tenderness. In the absence of ultrasound or hCG assessment, heavy vaginal bleeding {{may lead to a}} misdiagnosis of miscarriage. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are more rare symptoms of ectopic pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|A {{physical}} examination, {{including a}} pelvic examination, and a pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal or otherwise) are both essential for diagnosis: physical examination may reveal increased abdominal girth and/or ascites (fluid within the abdominal cavity), while pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass. An <b>adnexal</b> mass {{is a significant}} finding that often indicates ovarian cancer, especially if it is fixed, nodular, irregular, solid, and/or bilateral. 13–21% of <b>adnexal</b> masses are caused by malignancy; however, there are other benign causes of <b>adnexal</b> masses, including ovarian follicular cyst, leiomyoma, endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy, hydrosalpinx, tuboovarian abscess, ovarian torsion, dermoid cyst, cystadenoma (serous or mucinous), diverticular or appendiceal abscess, nerve sheath tumor, pelvic kidney, ureteral or bladder diverticulum, benign cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum, peritoneal tuberculosis, or paraovarian cyst. Ovaries that can be felt are also a sign of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women. Other parts of a physical examination for suspected ovarian cancer can include a breast examination and a digital rectal exam. Palpation of the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes may reveal lymphadenopathy, which can be indicative of metastasis. Another indicator may be {{the presence of a}} pleural effusion, which can be noted on auscultation.|$|E
25|$|CT {{scanning}} {{is preferred}} {{to assess the}} extent of the tumor in the abdominopelvic cavity, though magnetic resonance imaging can also be used. CT scanning can also be useful for finding omental caking or differentiating fluid from solid tumor in the abdomen, especially in low malignant potential tumors. However, it may not detect smaller tumors. Sometimes, a chest x-ray is used to detect metastases in the chest or pleural effusion. Another test for metastatic disease, though it is infrequently used, is a barium enema, which can show if the rectosigmoid colon is involved in the disease. Positron emission tomography, bone scans, and paracentesis are of limited use; in fact, paracentesis can cause metastases to form at the needle insertion site and may not provide useful results. However, paracentesis can be used in cases where there is no pelvic mass and ascites is still present. A physician suspecting ovarian cancer may also perform mammography or an endometrial biopsy (in the case of abnormal bleeding) to assess the possibility of breast malignancies and endometrial malignancy, respectively. Vaginal ultrasonography is often the first-line imaging study performed when an <b>adnexal</b> mass is found. Several characteristics of an <b>adnexal</b> mass indicate ovarian malignancy; they usually are solid, irregular, multilocular, and/or large; and they typically have papillary features, central vessels, and/or irregular internal septations. However, SCST has no definitive characteristics on radiographic study.|$|E
25|$|Malignant {{germ cell}} tumors are {{the type of}} ovarian cancer most likely to occur during pregnancy. They are {{typically}} diagnosed when an <b>adnexal</b> mass is found on examination (in 1–2% of all pregnancies), a tumor is seen on ultrasound, or the parent's level of alpha-fetoprotein is elevated. Dermoid cysts and dysgerminomas {{are the most common}} germ cell tumors during pregnancy. Germ cell tumors diagnosed during pregnancy are unlikely to have metastasized and can be treated by surgery and, in some cases, chemotherapy, which carries the risk of birth defects. Yolk sac tumors and immature teratomas grow particularly quickly and are usually treated with chemotherapy even during pregnancy; however, dysgerminomas that have been optimally debulked may be treated after childbirth.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of a uterine fibroid versus an <b>adnexal</b> tumor is made. Fibroids can be mistaken for ovarian neoplasms. An uncommon tumor which may {{be mistaken for a}} fibroid is Sarcoma botryoides. It is more common in children and adolescents. Like a fibroid, it can also protrude from the vagina and is distinguished from fibroids. While palpation used in a pelvic examination can typically identify the {{presence of}} larger fibroids, gynecologic ultrasonography (ultrasound) has evolved as the standard tool to evaluate the uterus for fibroids. Sonography will depict the fibroids as focal masses with a heterogeneous texture, which usually cause shadowing of the ultrasound beam. The location can be determined and dimensions of the lesion measured. Also, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to define the depiction of the size and location of the fibroids within the uterus.|$|E

500|$|Upon a pelvic examination, {{cervical}} motion, uterine, or <b>adnexal</b> tenderness will be experienced. [...] Mucopurulent cervicitis and or urethritis may be observed. In {{severe cases}} more testing {{may be required}} such as laparoscopy, intra-abdominal bacteria sampling and culturing, or tissue biopsy.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{method for}} {{quantifying}} risk {{of ovarian cancer}} is the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA), observes levels over time and [...] determines if they are increasing rapidly enough to warrant transvaginal ultrasound. The Risk of Ovarian Malignancy algorithm uses CA-125 levels and HE4 levels to calculate the risk of ovarian cancer; {{it may be more}} effective than RMI. The IOTA models can be used to estimate the probability that an <b>adnexal</b> tumor is malignant. They include LR2 risk model, The Simple Rules risk (SRrisk) calculation and Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the Adnexa (ADNEX) model {{that can be used to}} assess risk of malignancy in an <b>adnexal</b> mass, based on its characteristics and risk factors. The QCancer (Ovary) algorithm is used to predict likelihood of ovarian cancer from risk factors.|$|E
2500|$|Ovarian {{cancer is}} usually only palpable in {{advanced}} stages. [...] Screening {{is not recommended}} using CA-125 measurements, HE4 levels, ultrasound, or <b>adnexal</b> palpation in women who are at average risk. Risk of developing ovarian cancer in those with genetic factors can be reduced. Those with a genetic predisposition may benefit from screening. This high risk group has benefited with earlier detection.|$|E
2500|$|An {{ultrasound}} {{showing a}} gestational sac with fetal {{heart in the}} fallopian tube has a very high specificity of ectopic pregnancy. Transvaginal ultrasonography has a sensitivity of at least 90% for ectopic pregnancy. The diagnostic ultrasonographic finding in ectopic pregnancy is an <b>adnexal</b> mass that moves separately from the ovary. In around 60% of cases, it is an inhomogeneous or a noncystic <b>adnexal</b> mass sometimes known as the [...] "blob sign". It is generally spherical, but a more tubular appearance {{may be seen in}} case of hematosalpinx. This sign has been estimated to have a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 99% in diagnosing ectopic pregnancy. In the study estimating these values, the blob sign had a positive predictive value of 96% and a negative predictive value of 95%. The visualization of an empty extrauterine gestational sac is sometimes known as the [...] "bagel sign", and is present in around 20% of cases. In another 20% of cases, there is visualization of a gestational sac containing a yolk sac and/or an embryo. Ectopic pregnancies where there is visualization of cardiac activity are sometimes termed [...] "viable ectopic".|$|E
2500|$|The growing mass {{may cause}} pain if ovarian torsion develops. Symptoms {{can be caused}} by a mass {{pressing}} on the other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered. Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule. Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis. [...] Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an <b>adnexal</b> mass.|$|E
2500|$|Where no intrauterine {{pregnancy}} is seen on ultrasound, measuring β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels may {{aid in the}} diagnosis. The rationale is that a low β-hCG level may indicate that the {{pregnancy is}} intrauterine but yet {{too small to be}} visible on ultrasonography. While some physicians consider that the threshold where an intrauterine pregnancy should be visible on transvaginal ultrasound is around 1500 IU/ml of β-hCG, a review in the JAMA Rational Clinical Examination Series showed that there is no single threshold for the β-human chorionic gonadotropin that confirms an ectopic pregnancy. [...] Instead, the best test in a pregnant woman is a high resolution transvaginal ultrasound. The presence of an <b>adnexal</b> mass {{in the absence of an}} intrauterine pregnancy on transvaginal sonography increases the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy 100-fold (LR+ 111). [...] When there are no <b>adnexal</b> abnormalities on transvaginal sonography, the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy decreases (LR- 0.12). An empty uterus with levels higher than 1500 IU/ml may be evidence of an ectopic pregnancy, but may also be consistent with an intrauterine pregnancy which is simply too small to be seen on ultrasound. If the diagnosis is uncertain, it may be necessary to wait a few days and repeat the blood work. This can be done by measuring the β-hCG level approximately 48 hours later and repeating the ultrasound. The serum hCG ratios and logistic regression models appear to be better than absolute single serum hCG level. If the β-hCG falls on repeat examination, this strongly suggests a spontaneous abortion or rupture. The fall in serum hCG over 48 hours may be measured as the hCG ratio, which is calculated as: ...|$|E
