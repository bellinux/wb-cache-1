We confirm the bimodal color and morphological type distribution for satellite galaxies at this redshift range: the red and blue classes corresponds to the early and late morphological types respectively, and the early-type satellites are on average brighter than the late-type ones. Furthermore, there is a morphological conformity between the central and satellite galaxies: the fraction of early-type satellites in groups with an early-type central is higher than those with a late-type central galaxy. This effect is stronger at smaller separations from the central galaxy.

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of galaxy groups found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4, we measure the {{following}} four types of alignment signals: (1) the alignment between the distributions of the satellites of each group relative to {{the direction of the}} nearest neighbor group (NNG); (2) the alignment between the major axis direction of the central galaxy of the host group (HG) and the direction of the NNG; (3) the alignment between the major axes of the central galaxies of the HG and the NNG; and (4) the alignment between the major axes of the satellites of the HG and the direction of the NNG. We find strong <b>signal</b> of <b>alignment</b> between the satellite distribution and the orientation of central galaxy relative to the direction of the NNG, even when the NNG is located beyond 3 r_ vir of the host group. The major axis of the central galaxy of the HG is aligned with the direction of the NNG. The <b>alignment</b> <b>signals</b> are more prominent for groups that are more massive and with early type central galaxies. We also find that there is a preference for the two major axis of the central galaxies of the HG and NNG to be parallel for the system with both early central galaxies, however not for the systems with both late type central galaxies. For the orientation of satellite galaxies, we do not find any significant <b>alignment</b> <b>signals</b> relative to the direction of the NNG. From these four types of alignment measurements, we conclude that the large scale environment traced by the nearby group affects primarily the shape of the host dark matter halo, and hence also affects the distribution of satellite galaxies and the orientation of central galaxies.

40|$|We {{present a}} finely binned tomographic weak lensing {{analysis}} of the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) mitigating contamination to the signal from the presence of intrinsic galaxy alignments via the simultaneous fit of a cosmological model and an intrinsic alignment model. CFHTLenS spans 154 square degrees in five optical bands, with accurate shear and photometric redshifts for a galaxy sample with a median redshift of z_m = 0. 70. We estimate the 21 sets of cosmic shear correlation functions associated with six redshift bins, each spanning the angular range of 1. 5 < θ < 35 arcmin. We combine this CFHTLenS data with auxiliary cosmological probes: {{the cosmic microwave background}} with data from WMAP 7, baryon acoustic oscillations with data from Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey and a prior on the Hubble constant from the Hubble Space Telescope distance ladder. This leads to constraints on the normalization of the matter power spectrum σ_ 8 = 0. 799 ± 0. 015 and the matter density parameter Ω_m = 0. 271 ± 0. 010 for a flat Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology.

40|$|Intrinsic {{alignments}} {{of galaxies}} {{have been shown}} to contaminate weak gravitational lensing observables on linear scales, r 3 ̆e 10 h− 1 Mpc, but studies of alignments in the non-linear regime have thus far been inconclusive. We present an estimator for extracting the intrinsic <b>alignment</b> <b>signal</b> of galaxies around stacked clusters of galaxies from multiband imaging data. Our estimator removes the contamination caused by galaxies that are gravitationally lensed by the clusters and scattered in redshift space due to photometric redshift uncertainties. It uses posterior probability distributions for the redshifts of the galaxies in the sample and it is easily extended to obtain the weak gravitational lensing signal while removing the intrinsic alignment contamination. We apply this algorithm to groups and clusters of galaxies identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ‘Stripe 82 ’ co-added imaging data over ∼ 150 deg 2. We find that the intrinsic <b>alignment</b> <b>signal</b> around stacked clusters in the redshift range 0. 1 3 ̆c z 3 ̆c 0. 4 is consistent with zero. In terms of the tidal alignment model of Catelan et al., we set joint constraints on the strength of the alignment and the bias of the lensing groups and clusters on scales between 0. 1 and 10 [*]h− 1 Mpc,. This constrains the contamination fraction of alignment to lensing signal to the range between [− 18, 23] per cent below scales of 1 h− 1 Mpc at 95 per cent confidence level, and this result depends on our photometric redshift quality and selection criteria used to identify background galaxies.

This masking was effective only in the dichoptic presentation, not in the monocular presentation. These results indicate that phase alignment of the high spatial frequency components plays a crucial role for interocular suppression.

The problem has been widely studied by numerical simulations and with heuristic models, but without a clear theoretical justification of its origin and amplitude.

We investigate this question by developing a simple model of intrinsic alignment for elliptical galaxies, based on the instantaneous tidal field. Making use of the galaxy stellar distribution function, we estimate the intrinsic <b>alignment</b> <b>signal</b> and find that although it has the expected dependence on the tidal field, it is too weak to account for the observed signal.

In this paper, we discuss the effects of finite coverage on these observables. The results from a multi-phase transport and a toy model both indicate that a pseudorapidity coverage narrower than |η|< ∼ 1. 3 will generate a larger value for the extracted ρ_ 00 parameter for ϕ mesons and p_H parameter for Λ hyperons. A finite p_T coverage also affects the extracted parameters. As a result, a finite coverage can lead to an artificial deviation from 1 / 3 on the extracted ρ_ 00 as well as a small deviation from 0 for the extracted p_H even if there were no polarization. Therefore proper corrections should be made to the experimental observables before one can reliably quantify the global polarization. Comment: 7 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
