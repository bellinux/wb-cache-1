5|$|Korn made a demo tape, Neidermayer's Mind, in 1993, {{which was}} {{distributed}} free to record companies and on request {{to members of}} the public. Their debut album, Korn, was released in 1994, followed by Life Is Peachy in 1996. The band experienced mainstream success with Follow the Leader (1998) and Issues (1999), both of which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The band's mainstream success continued with Untouchables (2002), Take <b>a</b> <b>Look</b> <b>in</b> the Mirror (2003) and See You on the Other Side (2005).|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the album}} Untouchables leaking onto the Internet, Take <b>a</b> <b>Look</b> <b>in</b> the Mirror was {{released}} on a Friday, November 21, 2003 – four days earlier than its original release date. The album therefore received a weekend's worth of sales, {{which resulted in a}} poor showing on the Billboard 200. During its first full week, Take <b>a</b> <b>Look</b> <b>in</b> the Mirror soared ten places from number nineteen to number nine, increasing the album's total sales to 179,000. It is the first album self-produced by Korn. The band explained that they wanted fans to hear the music as it should be. The album presented different styles and themes compared to previous albums. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis related: [...] "The whole album is about love, hate and my hate of people and just losing my mind. The previous albums I did, I think the last three, I was coming from a place of hurt. And I just finally {{got to the point where}} I'm done hurting and I'm just pissed off about it now. It's turned back to just sheer hate and anger. And it definitely comes across on the album." [...] MTV News said that Davis convinced his fans that they [...] "will be shocked, particularly with the album's second track, 'Break Some Off,' which he called 'brutal'." [...] Korn released the single [...] "Did My Time" [...] on July 22, 2003, which was used to promote the film but did not appear on the soundtrack to [...] due to unspecified legal issues. The single debuted and peaked at number thirty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Korn's first and only top-forty hit in the United States. [...] "Did My Time" [...] gave Korn another Grammy nomination in the Best Metal Performance category.|$|E
500|$|... "Paranoid Android" [...] is {{categorised}} {{by three}} distinct moods written in what Yorke {{referred to as}} three different states of mind. The song's lyrics tie in {{with a number of}} themes common in OK Computer, including insanity, violence, slogans, and political objection to capitalism. Yorke's lyrics were based on an unpleasant experience at a Los Angeles bar during which he was surrounded by strangers high on cocaine. In particular, Yorke was frightened by a woman who became violent after someone spilled a drink on her. Yorke characterised the woman as [...] "inhuman", and said [...] "There was <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> this woman's eyes that I'd never seen before anywhere.... Couldn't sleep that night because of it." [...] The woman inspired the line [...] "kicking squealing Gucci little piggy" [...] in the song's second section. Yorke, referring to the line [...] "With your opinions, which are of no consequence at all", said that [...] "Again, that's just a joke. It's actually the other way around– it's actually my opinion that is of no consequence at all." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cole {{followed}} that success with another album of jazz standards, titled Take <b>a</b> <b>Look,</b> <b>in</b> 1993, which included her {{recording of the}} title track in the same styling that her idol Aretha Franklin had recorded nearly 30 years earlier. The album eventually went gold while a holiday album, Holly & Ivy, also became gold. Another standards release, Stardust, went platinum and featured another duet with her father on a modern version of [...] "When I Fall in Love", which helped Cole earn another Grammy for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.|$|E
2500|$|By 1982, {{only four}} players and three {{starting}} pitchers remained from the 1980 squad. The Astros {{were out of}} pennant contention by August and began rebuilding for the near future. Bill Virdon was fired as manager and replaced by original Colt [...]45 Bob Lillis. Don Sutton asked to be traded and {{was sent to the}} Milwaukee Brewers for cash and the team gained three new prospects, including Kevin Bass. [...] Minor league player Bill Doran was called up in September. Bass also got <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the outfield. [...] The Astros finished fourth in the west, but new talent was starting to appear.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} equally vehement {{opposition}} to Hirst's work. Norman Tebbit, {{commenting on the}} Sensation exhibition, wrote [...] "Have they gone stark raving mad? The works of the 'artist' are lumps of dead animals. There are thousands of young artists who didn't get <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>in,</b> presumably because their work was too attractive to sane people. Modern art experts never learn." [...] The view of the tabloid press was summed up by a Daily Mail headline: [...] "For 1,000 years art {{has been one of}} our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all." [...] The Evening Standard art critic, Brian Sewell, said simply, [...] "I don't think of it as art ... It is no more interesting than a stuffed pike over a pub door. Indeed there may well be more art in a stuffed pike than a dead sheep." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nu metal bands {{occasionally}} feature hip hop musicians {{as guests}} in their songs; Korn's song [...] "Children of the Korn" [...] features the rapper Ice Cube, who {{performed on the}} band's 1998 Family Values Tour. The hip hop musician Nas was featured on Korn's song [...] "Play Me", {{which is on the}} band's album Take <b>a</b> <b>Look</b> <b>in</b> the Mirror. Limp Bizkit has recorded with multiple hip hop musicians including Method Man, Lil Wayne, Xzibit, Redman, DMX and Snoop Dogg. Linkin Park collaborated with hip hop musician Jay Z on their 2004 extended play Collision Course. Kid Rock has recorded with hip hop musicians Eminem and Snoop Dogg. Trevor Baker of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Bands such as Linkin Park, Korn and even the much reviled Limp Bizkit... did far more to break down the artificial barriers between 'urban music' and rock than any of their more critically acceptable counterparts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2002, Nas {{released}} the God's Son album including its lead single, [...] "Made You Look" [...] which used a pitched down {{sample of the}} Incredible Bongo Band's [...] "Apache". The album peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums charts despite widespread Internet bootlegging. Time Magazine named his album best hip-hop album of the year. Vibe gave it four stars and The Source gave it four mics. The second single, [...] "I Can", which reworked elements from Beethoven's [...] "Für Elise", became Nas's biggest hit to date during {{the spring and summer}} of 2003, garnering substantial radio airplay on urban, rhythmic, and top 40 radio stations, as well as on the MTV and VH1 music video networks. God's Son also includes several songs dedicated to Nas's mother, who died of cancer in April 2002, including [...] "Dance". In 2003, Nas was featured on the Korn song [...] "Play Me", from Korn's Take <b>a</b> <b>Look</b> <b>in</b> the Mirror LP. Also in 2003, a live performance in New York City, featuring Ludacris, Jadakiss, and Darryl McDaniels (of Run-D.M.C. fame), was released on DVD as Made You Look: God's Son Live.|$|E
2500|$|Most of nu metal's {{mainstream}} popularity sharply {{declined in}} 2003 and 2004. After {{a period of}} mainstream success with bands such as Godsmack, Trapt, Linkin Park and Evanescence, nu metal declined in popularity. Limp Bizkit's 2003 album Results May Vary, which features elements of alternative rock and , peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200. Awards |publisher=Allmusic}} However, Results May Vary had a very poor critical reception and consequently performed much weaker than previous Limp Bizkit albums such as Significant Other and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water. Although Korn's album Take <b>a</b> <b>Look</b> <b>in</b> the Mirror song [...] "Did My Time" [...] peaked at number 38 on the Billboard Hot 100, the album sold less than previous Korn albums Issues and Untouchables. In 2004, post-punk revival bands such as Jet and The Darkness were achieving mainstream success as the popularity of nu metal declined. During the mid-2000s, the popularity of emo exceeded the declining popularity of nu metal. Also, during the mid-2000s, metalcore, a fusion of extreme metal and hardcore punk, {{became one of the}} most popular genres in the New Wave of American Heavy Metal.|$|E
