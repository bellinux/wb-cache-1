5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the <b>awkward</b> <b>position</b> of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Barkley, {{recently}} {{chosen as}} Senate Majority Leader {{by a single}} vote, was {{a strong supporter of}} President Roosevelt and the New Deal. Chandler identified with the more conservative southern Democrats who, wary of Roosevelt and his New Deal, sought to gain control of the party ahead of the 1940 presidential election. Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky, Chandler was put in the <b>awkward</b> <b>position</b> of expressing personal support of the president while opposing his hand-picked leader in the Senate and his New Deal legislation. In April, polls showed Barkley ahead of Chandler by a 2-to-1 margin, and the May 3 primary victory of New Deal Florida Senator Claude Pepper finally persuaded Chandler to abandon his attacks of the program.|$|E
5|$|Syrgiannes was {{dissatisfied}} with the new arrangements, feeling {{that he had not}} been sufficiently rewarded for his support of Andronikos III. He also resented the greater favour shown by the young emperor to Kantakouzenos, and developed a fierce rivalry with the latter. Furthermore, chroniclers also report a story whereby Andronikos III attempted to seduce Syrgiannes's wife. In December 1321, Syrgiannes switched sides, fleeing to Constantinople. Rewarded with the lofty title of megas doux, he convinced Andronikos II to resume the war against his grandson. In July 1322, however, another agreement was reached between the two Andronikoi, which left Syrgiannes in an <b>awkward</b> <b>position.</b> His own schemes having failed, he began plotting to murder the aged Andronikos II and seize the throne for himself. The plot was foiled, however, and Syrgiannes was sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|MacMillan {{was in an}} <b>awkward</b> <b>position.</b> It {{was widely}} known that Ashton had been forced out, and many resented it. Company morale was lowered by an announcement, to which MacMillan and Field were party, that the two ballet {{companies}} would merge, with numerous job losses. The managerial side of the post was no more congenial to MacMillan {{than it had been}} in Berlin, and some felt that his creative work suffered during his seven-year term. His expansion of Anastasia into a three-act version (1971) and the other full-length work from this period, Manon (1974), divided opinion, receiving fiercely adverse reviews as well as laudatory ones. His Joplin ballet Elite Syncopations (1974) and Requiem (1976) were immediately successful and have been regularly revived. The latter was dedicated to the memory of Cranko, who had died suddenly in 1973. It was premiered at Stuttgart, because as with Song of the Earth the Royal Opera House board thought the chosen music – Fauré's Requiem – inappropriate for a ballet. The work was not given at Covent Garden until 1983.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an <b>awkward</b> <b>position,</b> swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
5|$|In January 1827, the General Assembly {{considered}} {{whether to}} elect U.S. Senator John Randolph {{for a full}} six-year term. Randolph was a contentious figure; although he shared the staunch states' rights views held {{by most of the}} Virginia legislature, he had a reputation for fiery rhetoric and erratic behavior on the Senate floor, which put his allies in an <b>awkward</b> <b>position.</b> Furthermore, he had made enemies by fiercely opposing President John Quincy Adams and Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. The nationalists of the Democratic-Republican Party, who supported Adams and Clay, were a sizable minority in the Virginia legislature. They hoped to unseat Randolph by capturing the vote of states' rights supporters who were uncomfortable with the senator's reputation. They approached Tyler, and promised their endorsement if he sought the seat. Tyler repeatedly declined the offer, endorsing Randolph as the best candidate, but the political pressure continued to mount. Eventually he agreed to accept the seat if chosen. On the day of the vote, one assemblyman argued there was no political difference between the two candidates—Tyler was merely more agreeable than Randolph. The incumbent's supporters, though, contended that Tyler's election would be a tacit endorsement of the Adams administration. The legislature selected Tyler in a vote of 115–110, and he resigned his governorship on March 4, 1827, as his Senate term began.|$|E

25|$|Deployed {{southeast}} of Halle, Eugene {{found himself in}} an <b>awkward</b> <b>position</b> with his line of retreat to the north stretching past {{the east side of}} Halle. He quickly shifted two battalions northward to face the Steinthor and prevent the French from cutting him off from Dessau. Reinforced by the remainder of Dupont's division, the French improvised defenses at the Steinthor and Galgenthor and in the gardens along the edge of Halle. When Rivaud's division began to arrive, led by the 8th Line, it was fed into the line near the Galgenthor. This allowed Dupont to mass his division, together with a hussar regiment, to the north near the Steinthor. The French skirmishers moved forward and subjected the Prussians to severe harassing fire.|$|E

From this <b>awkward</b> <b>position,</b> McCarthy managed to collect together a team from the club's youth ranks, and some lower league signings, and free transfers. Despite the lack of expectations, the team managed to make the promotion play-offs in McCarthy's first season, but it was third time unlucky for McCarthy in them as the team lost out to local rivals West Bromwich Albion over two legs, losing 3–2 at Molineux and 1–0 at The Hawthorns.|$|E
25|$|Mille's group found {{a friend}} in Constantin Stere, by then a {{maverick}} member of the PNL, who began maneuvering against the PNL's right-wing from the inside. Managing a literary sheet {{put out by the}} pro-PNL Evenimentul, Stere supported Adevărul in its campaign for literary didacticism, and organized rallies of solidarity with the Bucharest socialists. This happened just as Toni was publishing satirical pieces targeting Evenimentul owner George A.

The incidents were reviewed with caution by Adevărul, whose panelists feared that a Conservative conspiracy was in the making, but Toni also criticized the PNL papers for suggesting the same.|$|E

25|$|As Richard Cromwell {{fell from}} power, he envisaged a step towards a freer {{republic}} or “free commonwealth”, {{writing in the}} hope of this outcome in early 1660. Milton had argued for an <b>awkward</b> <b>position,</b> in the Ready and Easy Way, because he wanted to invoke the Good Old Cause and gain the support of the republicans, but without offering a democratic solution of any kind. His proposal, backed by reference (amongst other reasons) to the oligarchical Dutch and Venetian constitutions, was for a council with perpetual membership. This attitude cut right across the grain of popular opinion of the time, which swung decisively behind the restoration of the Stuart monarchy that took place later in the year. Milton, an associate of and advocate on behalf of the regicides, was silenced on political matters as Charles II returned.|$|E
25|$|Martínez {{planned a}} {{breakout}} {{on the night}} of 16 August. Rovira, who had come back from Cadiz, menaced the north side of MacDonald's siege works with 2,000 guerillas. However, a French force chased his men out of the area. As soon as night fell, Martínez launched a massed column of his fittest troops at the southwestern siege lines. The Spanish column overran the pickets and the outpost line, but the soldiers were brought to a stand by a dense abatis. While they were caught in this <b>awkward</b> <b>position,</b> two French batteries opened fire on the column. After suffering 400 casualties, the survivors fled back into the fortress. The following day d'Hilliers sent an officer under a flag of truce into the fort and Martínez agreed to surrender after issuing his last rations. On 19 August 1811, the Spanish garrison marched out and laid down its weapons.|$|E
25|$|On May 15, 2006, the station's studios {{moved to}} a new {{facility}} near Winnipeg's MTS Centre. This move was mostly caused by recent retail developments in the area, which includes the Polo Park Shopping Centre, and the likelihood that CKY's studios were bought off by developers who would use the space for additional retail opportunities. The recent demolition of Winnipeg Arena and the possible development of a new football stadium to replace Canad Inns Stadium would have likely placed the broadcasting facility in an <b>awkward</b> <b>position</b> of being surrounded by retail developments, making their property more valuable. CKY's new studios uses state-of-the-art technology, and virtually nothing was moved from the old studios to the new facility. The existing news set was moved to CFQC, the CTV affiliate in Saskatoon, and some technical equipment was sent to CTV's Quebec City bureau. In addition, the master control of the station was moved to 9 Channel Nine Court, home of flagship CTV station CFTO-TV in Toronto.|$|E

A flashback episode revealed that his distrust of Muslims stems more from an unpleasant encounter with Baber than from any deeply held prejudices. His radio rants are primarily a ratings-grabbing persona; while he can be a blowhard jerk on and off the air, he treats pretty much everyone with equal condescension (not just Muslims). By season 3, it is revealed that his objectionable comments {{have more to do with}} habit and keeping ratings up, than any active dislike of Muslims. In fact, when he believes he is dying, he is downright friendly to everyone (including Muslims) and almost declares his love to Fatima. She graciously allows him his dignity when he claims it is in fact her hummus that he loves. Fred Tupper is also a divorcee.|$|E

50|$|Hazards can be {{classified}} as different types in several ways. One of these ways is by specifying {{the origin of the}} hazard. One key concept in identifying a hazard is the presence of stored energy that, when released, can cause damage. Stored energy can occur in many forms: chemical, mechanical, thermal, radioactive, electrical, etc. Another class of hazard does not involve release of stored energy, rather it involves the presence of hazardous situations. Examples include confined or limited egress spaces, oxygen-depleted atmospheres, <b>awkward</b> <b>positions,</b> repetitive motions, low-hanging or protruding objects, etc.|$|R

25|$|The governess {{occupied}} a uniquely <b>awkward</b> <b>position</b> in the Victorian household, {{because she was}} neither a servant nor yet {{a member of the}} host family. She worked in the upper-class home of the landed gentry or aristocracy. She herself had a middle-class background and education, yet was paid for her services. As a sign of this social limbo she frequently ate on her own, away {{from the rest of the}} family and servants. By definition, a governess was an unmarried woman who lived in someone else's home, which meant that she was subject to their rules. In any case, she had to maintain an impeccable reputation by avoiding anything which could embarrass or offend her employers. If a particular governess was young and attractive, the lady of the house might well perceive a potential threat to her marriage, and enforce the governess' social exclusion more rigorously. As a result of these various restrictions, the lifestyle of the typical Victorian governess was often one of social isolation and solitude, without the opportunity to make friends. The fact that her presence in the household was underpinned by an employment contract emphasized that she could never truly be part of the host family.|$|E
25|$|During the {{two years}} that followed, only a few {{companies}} of the regiment would see active service, campaigning in Spain, where they accompanied Bessières in northwestern Spain, where the latter was supposed to support André Masséna's Army of Portugal. Masséna had been busy besieging general Wellington in Lisbon, {{but he was not}} able to pierce the fortified Lines of Torres Vedras and subsequently retreated to Almeida. Wellington made the critical error of following him and on May 5, 1809, he found himself in an <b>awkward</b> <b>position</b> at the battle of Fuentes de Oñoro. Masséna needed Bessières' entire Army Corps, if he wanted to thoroughly beat the Anglo-Portuguese, but Bessières brought only symbolic reinforcements: a few squadrons of horse dragoons and grenadiers, 800 men in all, under the command of general Louis Lepic. Despite this setback, Masséna brilliantly exploited a weakness in Wellington's line and it soon seemed like the Anglo-Portuguese would be crushed. Time was at the essence and Masséna promptly sent his young aide-de-camp, Charles Oudinot, to find Lepic and the Guard cavalry, with orders to charge immediately, but Oudinot was soon back to his commander, saying that {{he was not able to}} fetch the Guard cavalry, because Lepic only recognized Bessières as commander and that he would not draw his sword without his order. Bessières was nowhere to be found, allowing Wellington's army to escape intact.|$|E
25|$|As {{a nearly}} {{universal}} standard practice in modern recreational diving, the typical single-hose regulator has a spare demand valve fitted for emergency {{use by the}} diver's buddy, typically {{referred to as the}} octopus because of the extra hose, or secondary demand valve. The octopus was invented by Dave Woodward at UNEXSO around 1965-6 to support the free dive attempts of Jacques Mayol. Woodward believed that having the safety divers carry two second stages would be a safer and more practical approach than buddy breathing {{in the event of an}} emergency. The medium pressure hose on the octopus is usually longer than the medium pressure hose on the primary demand valve that the diver uses, and the demand valve and/or hose may be colored yellow to aid in locating in an emergency. The secondary regulator should be clipped to the diver's harness in a position where it can be easily seen and reached by both the diver and the potential sharer of air. The longer hose is used for convenience when sharing air, so that the divers are not forced to stay in an <b>awkward</b> <b>position</b> relative to each other. Technical divers frequently extend this feature and use a 5-foot or 7-foot hose, which allows divers to swim in single file while sharing air, which may be necessary in restricted spaces inside wrecks or caves.|$|E
