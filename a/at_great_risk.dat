Most of the airmen credit their survival at Buchenwald to the leadership and determination of Lamason. After the war, he moved to Dannevirke and became a farmer until his retirement. During the 1980s and 1990s, he was a regular speaker at KLB Club and POW reunions.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, 1st Baronet, GCB (4 June 1746 – 14 November 1816) was {{an officer}} of the British Royal Navy, who saw action in several battles during an {{extensive}} career that was punctuated by a number of highly controversial incidents. Curtis served during the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolutionary Wars and was highly praised in the former conflict for his bravery under fire at the Great Siege of Gibraltar, where he saved several hundred Spanish lives <b>at</b> <b>great</b> <b>risk</b> to his own. His career suffered however {{in the aftermath of the}} Glorious First of June, when he was heavily criticised for his conduct by several influential figures, including Cuthbert Collingwood. His popularity fell further due to his involvement in two highly controversial courts-martial, those of Anthony Molloy in 1795 and James Gambier in 1810.|$|E

5|$|On 20 November 1992, a {{major fire}} {{occurred}} at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread {{damage to the}} Upper Ward. The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated {{as part of a}} long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms, and severely damaged more than 100 others. Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection. The fire spread through the roof voids and efforts continued through the night to contain the blaze, <b>at</b> <b>great</b> <b>risk</b> to the 200 fire-fighters involved. It was not until late afternoon that the blaze began to come under control, although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning. Along with the fire and smoke damage, one of the unintended effects of the fire-fighting was the considerable water damage to the castle; more than 1.5 million gallons of water were used to extinguish it, which in many ways caused more complex restoration problems than the fire.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveA {{narrative}} review {{describing the}} assessment of osteoarthritis (OA) progression, and more specifically the risk factors which assist in delineating strata of individuals <b>at</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> for more rapid progression. DesignA narrative review based on selected recent medical literature. ResultsWith little currently available {{in the treatment of}} this disease, better understanding of responsive and valid endpoints is essential to identifying potential new interventions for treatment of OA. Efforts to stratify those <b>at</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> for progression can use a number of systemic or local risk factors that may assist in delineating populations <b>at</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> for progression. ConclusionsCurrent data suggests that stratification of risk is feasible to ascertain those at risk for rapid progression using a number of different metrics including knee alignment, meniscal damage, bone marrow lesions and late stage disease. Identifying persons <b>at</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>risk</b> for progression has important implications for clinical trial planning and can enhance study efficiency...|$|R

25|$|Bain {{returned}} to command of Harpy {{a few weeks}} before he received promotion to post captain on 6 April 1813. Commander Thomas Griffith Allen replaced Bain that month. However, he died on 26 (or 28) September 1814, at Port Louis. Command devolved on Lieutenant William Lambert, Harpys first lieutenant. Earlier, in July, Lambert had led her boats in the rescue, <b>at</b> <b>great</b> <b>risk,</b> of the crew of the schooner Eugenie, which had wrecked on Sandy Island (near Mauritius) on 19 April. During the rescue the master and a seaman from Harpy drowned when their boat overturned.

To date, 6,620 Poles have been awarded the title of Righteous Among the Nations by the State of Israel–more than any other nation.

25|$|An {{important}} factor encouraging Comanche raids of Mexican ranches was the huge demand for horses and mules by the Anglo-Americans now flooding into lands {{west of the}} Mississippi River. The Comanches could meet that demand by breeding and selling horses from their herds, capturing and training wild horses from the numerous herds in Comancheria, or raiding Mexican ranches and taking horses. The last was often the preferred option of ambitious young men striving to become rich in a well-to-do pastoral society. Comanche raids for horses in Texas and along the Rio Grande in Mexico increased in 1831 and afterwards. A young, poor, or low ranking Comanche man could better his circumstances—albeit <b>at</b> <b>great</b> <b>risk</b> to his life—by raiding for horses and human captives. The wealth he obtained would enable him to buy a Comanche wife—or he might find a first, second, or third wife among the captives.|$|E

25|$|It {{was the son}} of the Exarch of Carthage, Heraclius (575–641), {{who would}} restore the empire's fortunes. Heraclius sailed east across the Mediterranean with an African fleet to the Byzantine capital city of Constantinople and overthrew the usurper Phocas. Heraclius then became Roman Emperor in 610. He began reorganizing the {{government}} and erecting defenses to counter threats to the capital. Notwithstanding, the Persians continued their invasion, meeting little resistance, taking Antioch in 611, Jerusalem in 614, and Alexandria in 619, in an astonishing series of victories. The hostile forces of Chosroes II soon stood before Constantinople. In response, Heraclius <b>at</b> <b>great</b> <b>risk</b> moved quickly a Roman army by ship east over the Black Sea, landing near his Khazar allies.

25|$|The second campaign, {{beginning}} {{in the spring of}} 1863, was successful and is considered Grant's greatest achievement of the war (and a classic campaign of military history). He knew that he could not attack through Mississippi from the northwest because of the vulnerability of his supply line; river-born approaches had failed repeatedly. So after movement became possible on dirt roads that were finally drying from the winter rains, Grant moved the bulk of his army down the western bank of the Mississippi. On April 16, U.S. Navy gunboats and troop transports managed <b>at</b> <b>great</b> <b>risk</b> to slip past the Vicksburg defensive guns and were able to ferry Grant's army across the river to land south of Vicksburg at Bruinsburg. Grant employed two strategic diversions to mask his intentions: a feint by Sherman north of Vicksburg and a daring cavalry raid through central Mississippi by Colonel Benjamin Grierson, known as Grierson's Raid. The former was inconclusive, but the latter was a success. Grierson was able to draw out significant Confederate forces, dispersing them around the state.|$|E
