40|$|Abstract. African tick-bite fever is an {{emerging}} infectious disease {{caused by the}} spotted fever group Rickettsia, Rickettsia <b>africae,</b> <b>and</b> is transmitted by ticks of the genus Amblyomma. To determine the seroprevalence of exposure to R. <b>africae</b> <b>and</b> risk factors associated with infection, we conducted a cross-sectional study of persons in seven rural villages in distinct ecological habitats of Cameroon. We examined 903 plasma samples by using an indirect immunofluorescence assay for antibodies to R. <b>africae</b> <b>and</b> analyzed demographic and occupational data collected from questionnaires. Of the 903 persons tested, 243 (26. 9 %) had IgG/IgM/IgA reactive with R. africae. Persons from four of the seven village sites {{were significantly more likely}} to be seropositive (P < 0. 05), and lowland forest sites tended to have higher seroprevalences. These results suggest that African tick-bite fever is common in adults in rural areas of Cameroon and that ecological factors may play a role in the acquisition of R. africae infection...|$|R
