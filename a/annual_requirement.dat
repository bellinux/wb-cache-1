Time is a persistent constraint that the reserve force contends with to accomplish annual general military training requirements and mission essential tasks. Currently, there are 18 annual general military training requirements the reserve component must accomplish. Previous studies have attempted to reduce and combine <b>annual</b> training <b>requirements</b> to give time back to the commander. This research will not identify ways to reduce requirements; rather, it will identify ways that the reserve component can more efficiently and effectively accomplish <b>annual</b> training <b>requirements</b> based on feedback from Marines assigned to 4 th Assault Amphibian Battalion. The study analyzes methods 4 th Assault Amphibian Battalion uses to accomplish <b>annual</b> training <b>requirements.</b> Command chronology analysis and interviews provide exploratory insight to the unit's annual training model. Using command chronology data and interview transcripts, we develop a training model {{that can be used to}} improve training effectiveness and efficiency.
