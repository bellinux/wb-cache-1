40|$|The aroma {{quality of}} raw cocoa beans mainly {{depends on the}} {{fermentation}} degree because the necessary aroma precursors are developed during fermentation.

They are significantly altered during fermentation and longer storage periods of raw cocoa beans. The concentration of methyl- 1 -butanols increases during fermentation or decreases in beans that have been stored for several years.

The immobilized biocatalysts were allowed in the fermented must after the end of fermentation for extended storage time periods at 30 degrees C, before reactivation and reuse in wine fermentations. Immobilized cells were stored and remained active for longer time periods (up to 80 days) than free cells. The results showed that there were no negative effects on volatile product composition during storage. Duncan's multiple range test showed that in some cases storage resulted in statistically increased levels of acetaldehyde in the produced wines, while ethyl acetate concentration ranged in normal levels. Higher (1 -propanol and isobutanol), <b>amyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> and methanol content remained in low levels in all cases, indicating an improved quality product. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
