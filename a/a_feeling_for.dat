5|$|Angelou later gained fame as {{an author}} and a poet, most notably her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. In her fourth autobiography, The Heart of a Woman, she downplays her singing career and assigns little {{importance}} to Miss Calypso. In 1995, the album was re-released as a CD {{during a period of}} customer interest in 1950s exotica. Its artistry was re-examined in light of Angelou's later fame; it was said to exemplify the calypso music of the period, spiced with <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> the tradition's roots.|$|E

During her final years, McClintock led a more public life, especially after Evelyn Fox Keller's 1983 biography of her, <b>A</b> <b>Feeling</b> <b>for</b> the Organism, brought McClintock's story to the public. She remained a regular presence in the Cold Spring Harbor community, and gave talks on mobile genetic elements and the history of genetics research for the benefit of junior scientists. An anthology of her 43 publications The Discovery and Characterization of Transposable Elements: The Collected Papers of Barbara McClintock was published in 1987.|$|E

500|$|When The Secret River first {{appeared}} in 1955, Saturday Review called it a [...] "little masterpiece of the imagination of childhood... so real and appealing one regrets {{that this is the}} only book the author wrote for children... Leonard Weisgard has done some of his most sensitive work in drawings that have <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> character and place and are quite perfect for the text."

500|$|Bizet's early one-act opera Le docteur Miracle {{provides}} the first clear signs of his promise in this genre, its sparkling music including, according to Dean, [...] "many happy touches of parody, scoring and comic characterisation". Newman perceives evidence of Bizet's later achievements {{in many of}} his earliest works: [...] "gain and again we light upon some touch or other in them that only a musician with a dramatic root of the matter in him could have achieved." [...] Until Carmen, however, Bizet was not essentially an innovator in the musical theatre. He wrote most of his operas in the traditions of Italian and French opera established by such as Donizetti, Rossini, Berlioz, Gounod, and Thomas. Macdonald suggests that, technically, he surpassed all of these, with <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> the human voice that compares with that of Mozart.|$|E
500|$|Most of Ravel's piano {{music is}} {{extremely}} difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges. Writing of the piano music the critic Andrew Clark commented in 2013, [...] "A successful Ravel interpretation is a finely balanced thing. It involves subtle musicianship, <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> pianistic colour and the sort of lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in Alborada del gracioso... and the two outer movements of Gaspard de la nuit. Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, and it sounds pale." [...] This balance caused a breach between the composer and Viñes, who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in Gaspard de la nuit [...] "Le gibet" [...] would [...] "bore the audience to death". Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over-interpreting Ravel's piano writing.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of The Jazz Singer in 1927—the first feature-length film with some audible dialog—sound films, or talkies as they became nicknamed, were all the rage. The {{transition}} from silent to sound panicked many—if not all—involved with the film industry; many silent film stars found themselves unemployable because of their undesirable voices and hard-to-understand accents or simply because of their refusal {{to make the transition}} to talkies. Many studios and stars avoided making the transition as long as possible, especially MGM, which was the last studio to switch over to sound. The Hollywood Revue of 1929 (1929) was one of the studio's first all-talking films, and their first attempt to showcase their stars' ability to make the transition from silent to sound. Crawford was among the dozen or more MGM stars included in the movie; she sang the song [...] "Got <b>a</b> <b>Feeling</b> <b>for</b> You" [...] during the film's first act.|$|E
500|$|As Pei, {{neared the}} end of his {{secondary}} education, he decided to study at a university. He was accepted to a number of schools, but decided to enroll at the University of Pennsylvania. Pei's choice had two roots. While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world. The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him. The other major factor was Hollywood. Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of Bing Crosby, which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China. [...] "College life in the U.S. {{seemed to me to be}} mostly fun and games", he said in 2000. [...] "Since I was too young to be serious, I wanted to be part of it... You could get <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> it in Bing Crosby's movies. College life in America seemed very exciting to me. It's not real, we know that. Nevertheless, at that time it was very attractive to me. I decided that was the country for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Hardy said: [...] "He {{combined}} a {{power of}} generalization, <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> form, and a capacity for rapid modification of his hypotheses, that were often really startling, and made him, in his own peculiar field, without a rival in his day. The limitations of his knowledge were as startling as its profundity. Here {{was a man who}} could work out modular equations and theorems... to orders unheard of, whose mastery of continued fractions was... beyond that of any mathematician in the world, who had found for himself the functional equation of the zeta function and the dominant terms of many of the most famous problems in the analytic theory of numbers; and yet he had never heard of a doubly periodic function or of Cauchy's theorem, and had indeed but the vaguest idea of what a function of a complex variable was...". When asked about the methods Ramanujan employed to arrive at his solutions, Hardy said that they were [...] "arrived at by a process of mingled argument, intuition, and induction, of which he was entirely unable to give any coherent account." [...] He also stated that he had [...] "never met his equal, and can compare him only with Euler or Jacobi." ...|$|E

60|$|When we inquire, {{as well as}} the unformed {{condition}} of terrestrial sociology permits, into the aggregatory ideas that seem to satisfy men, we find a remarkable complex, a disorderly complex, in the minds of nearly all our civilised contemporaries.

500|$|In 1949 Cardus {{set up his}} London home at the National Liberal Club, while Edith took a flat in Bickenhall Mansions, {{just off}} Baker Street. The pair lived harmoniously apart, though in {{frequent}} contact, until Edith's death. Cardus found London's musical life invigorating, with five major orchestras {{and a host of}} distinguished conductors and solo artists performing regularly. Toscanini paid his final visit to England in 1952, with two concerts at the Royal Festival Hall. Outside London, Cardus was a regular visitor to the Edinburgh Festival and to Glyndebourne, and was in Manchester for the reopening of the Free Trade Hall and the [...] "homecoming" [...] of the Hallé Orchestra in November 1951. The inaugural concert concluded with Kathleen Ferrier singing [...] "Land of Hope and Glory". Cardus had first heard Ferrier at the Edinburgh Festival in 1947; he became a devoted admirer to the extent that, eventually, questions were raised about his critical blindness to her technical weaknesses. He wrote of her singing that it was, [...] "like the woman herself... imbued with a quiet but reliant sense and <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> the fun and goodness of life". He was devastated by her death from cancer in October 1953; the following year he edited and contributed to a memorial volume of tributes.|$|E

2500|$|In 1910, Chagall {{relocated}} to Paris {{to develop his}} artistic style. Art historian and curator James Sweeney notes that when Chagall first arrived in Paris, Cubism was the dominant art form, and French art was still dominated by the [...] "materialistic outlook of the 19th century". But Chagall arrived from Russia with [...] "a ripe color gift, a fresh, unashamed response to sentiment, <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> simple poetry {{and a sense of}} humor", he adds. These notions were alien to Paris at that time, and as a result, his first recognition came not from other painters but from poets such as Blaise Cendrars and Guillaume Apollinaire. Art historian Jean Leymarie observes that Chagall began thinking of art as [...] "emerging from the internal being outward, from the seen object to the psychic outpouring", which was the reverse of the Cubist way of creating.|$|E
2500|$|Eichinger and screenwriter Andrew Birkin {{began to}} write a draft script. Eichinger says that their biggest problem was a {{narrative}} one, [...] "The main character doesn't express himself. A novelist can use narrative to compensate for this; that's not possible in film. An audience can usually only get <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>for</b> a character if the character speaks", said Eichinger. Eichinger said, [...] "With material like this {{it is especially important}} for a director {{to get involved in the}} script." [...] Eichinger met with a number of directors but felt that only Tom Tykwer was really in tune with the material. In 2003, Tykwer was invited to join Eichinger and Birkin in adapting the novel. The screenplay went through over 20 revisions to get to the final shooting script. The three writers worked hard to create a faithful adaptation that captured the atmosphere and climate of the novel, yet, at the same time, have a specific and individual perspective, in terms of the story and the main character.|$|E
