Scientists working in this field may have training in cognitive neuroscience, neurology, neuroanatomy, psychology, music theory, computer science, and other allied fields, and use such techniques as {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), and positron emission tomography (PET).|$|E

40|$|Clusters of {{cultural}} and creative industries are rather widespread in and surrounding inner cities. The development and dynamics of these clusters are objects of study of various conceptual approaches: some aim at their role and significance for urban development, others at their development and dynamics as such. These latter approaches focus primarily on producers or consumers {{of cultural}} or creative goods. By contrast, this paper explores {{the role of a}} particular type of secondary or <b>ancillary</b> <b>activity</b> - the business incubator - in the development of these clusters. The paper is explorative and draws no explicit conclusions. Nevertheless, the incubator appears to be an <b>ancillary</b> <b>activity</b> that contributes in various manners to sustainable cluster development, i. e. not only by their output of young, trained entrepreneurs in possession of up-to-date knowledge and skills, but also by means of, for instance, their buildings and social networks. </p...|$|R

2500|$|The main {{empirical}} objection is, {{that there}} exists no accurate way to separate out productive and unproductive labor in official statistics (and the value each represents), {{even if the}} conceptual distinction could be validly defined. The main reasons are that [...] "productive labor" [...] is not equivalent to [...] "productive worker", that the same worker may perform tasks which are classified as partly productive and partly unproductive, and that how the product of various services (or the role of services in production) should be defined remains controversial. When statisticians allocate producer's occupations and outputs to a classification scheme, their defining criterion is the [...] "main activity" [...] of producers, disregarding their <b>ancillary</b> <b>activities.</b> Thus, already the base data represent an abstraction from reality.|$|E

At {{the conclusion of}} the project the core group of performers including Derek Ives and Antonella Casella expressed interest in continuing as an independent faction to exclusively perform circus. In 1987, led by Ives and Casella, the collective formally splintered off into a new troupe, taking the name of the production and going by 'Rock & Roll Circus'. Originally an <b>ancillary</b> <b>activity</b> by Street Arts, the troupe evolved to performing their own unique brand of circus fused with music and theatre.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{unemployment}} benefit schemes on individual productivity. We created employment and unemployment {{in the field and}} compared workers' productivity under no unemployment benefits to productivity under two different unemployment schemes. In one scheme, the unemployed received an unconditional monetary transfer. In the other, the monetary transfer was obtained conditional on the unemployed spending some time on an <b>ancillary</b> <b>activity.</b> Our results challenge the standard economic theory prediction that unemployment benefits, especially unconditional compensations, hinder workers' effort. We find that workers employed under the unconditional scheme are more productive than workers under the conditional one, and both schemes make workers more productive than having no unemployment benefit. We discuss two possible explanations for our results based on reciprocity and differential psychological costs of unemployment across unemployment benefit schemes...|$|R

Un-fortunately, in our recent experience developing production programs in Java, unit testing has only proven effective in assuring the reliability of code with a single thread of control; it is much less effective in concurrent programs. To facilitate the develop-ment of concurrent programs, we are developing: 1. An extension of the JUnit framework that actively supports the developer by treating tests that could silently ignore failures in auxiliary threads as test errors; 2. A lightweight Java annotation language that can be used to specify and check the threading invariants of both existing and new code; 3. A testing framework that can record and analyze the schedules of unit tests, detect deadlocks, and run the tests using modified schedules, increasing the likelihood that concurrency problems are discovered...|$|R

30|$|As {{teachers}} frame conjecturing {{tasks as}} primarily about {{the resources that}} students use, {{we see that the}} operations that students use to make conjectures and the conjectures that students arrive at could be underspecified and undervalued in classrooms. As a result, ‘making conjectures’ could be seen as an <b>ancillary</b> <b>activity.</b> One way to increase the specificity and value of students’ work on conjecturing tasks would be to increase and broaden the role that conjecturing plays in complying with the didactical contract in geometry. This might begin with policy changes, such as the inclusion of Standards for Mathematical Practice in the Common Core State Standards for mathematics. Further, conjecturing, including the specific operations that students engage in and the conjectures that they produce, would need to appear prominently in artifacts that shape teachers’ vision of the curriculum, including textbooks and local and national assessments. This study speaks to the interplay between what students know and are able to do mathematically in classrooms and the impact that teachers’ perceptions of students’ work have on the mathematical opportunities that students have in classrooms.|$|R

40|$|Six {{years of}} quasi-meridional {{crossings}} of the Antarctic Ocean from Antarctica to southern Africa between 4 °W and 16 °E longitude are analyzed, {{with emphasis on}} temperature and salinity distributions. Data are sparse, but (particularly in the south-ern part of the sections) adequate to show significant variations in the latitude/depth distributions and T-S characteristics of the principal water masses. In particular, the cross-sectional area occupied by Warm Deep Water (Weddell Deep Water) dropped by about one third in 1968. Positions of major features associated with the Antarctic Divergence varied by up to 5 degrees of latitude. The surface temperature gradient often observed at the Antarctic Divergence {{appears to be the}} surface expression of a shallow (possibly seasonal) thermocline which sometimes slopes upward to intersect the sea surface.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} ability of the polysystem theory to analyze the {{translation}} of political texts.

The hypothesis is that, by including in its model translator to a subject acting on the material struggles of political-cultural system, polysystem, as a theory, gain new value and applicability. In this new context, the translator acts on the receptor system as such, but also as an intellectual and activist. An obvious derivation is that the translation stops mere thought of as <b>ancillary</b> <b>activity</b> and passes form a network of relationships in which translator, activist and intellectual are facets of the same subject, here defined as international.
