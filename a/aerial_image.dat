The title comes as a tangent to the central theme of the album, [...] "the living noise of a metropolis". The cover art is part of A Modern Project by German photographer Rut Blees Luxemburg, famous for her night cityscapes of London and for the cover art of The Streets' Original Pirate Material. The photograph is an <b>aerial</b> <b>image</b> of London's Westway, which shows the road and the adjacent sports pitches lit by the sodium glow of street lamps, and was chosen because the band believed [...] "it was important we captured London breathing". Luxemburg has explained that [...] "in this picture you can see how intricately and optimistically public space in the city is shared".|$|E

This paper first uses the specthem ratio and Otsu threshold segmentation methods to detect building shadows on urban aerial true color and color infrared <b>aerial</b> <b>images.</b> Then, based on the shadow detection result, one of the color constancy algorithms SoG (Shades of Gray) is used to remove the shadows in <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> with different p values of the Minkowski norm. Finally, the shadow removal results with different p values have been compared by brightness, contrast and average gradients. The experiments show that {{the result of this}} method based on color constancy has a good visual effect, and different from general scene image shadow removal, the <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> get the best shadow removal result when p is 2. It means the two types of <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> should not be simply regarded as gray world images...|$|R

These evaluations are important for many public and private institutions, because they provide the control of environmental quality and its monitoring. In Brazil, the law obligates environmental evaluations for engineering works. Despite being an activity that can cause serious environmental damages, agricultural projects generally do not use these evaluations, mainly because of their high costs.

40|$|Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) is a {{technology}} used for collecting topographic data. Nowadays there are diverse application areas of LIDAR data that include DTM generation and building extraction. 3 D representations of buildings extracted from LIDAR data are often quite inaccurate regarding their {{location of the}} building edges. High resolution <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> {{have the potential to}} accurately extract 3 D straight lines of the building edges. Thus using <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> to extract building edges accurately is an option in particular if <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> are available in addition to LIDAR data. In this paper we present a study on straight line parameter estimation based on the line parameterisation proposed by Schenk (2004). We assume that an aerial triangulation is carried out in advance, hence the exterior orientation parameters of all images are known. The LIDAR data are used to get approximate values of straight line parameters and to simplify the line correspondence problem in the <b>aerial</b> <b>images.</b> The straight lines are extracted from the <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> and the 3 D line parameters are estimated. For extraction of straight lines in the <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> three techniques are used. Two of them are dealing with semi-automatic straight line extraction and third one focuses on automatic line extraction using the Hough transform. Quality of the results is investigated using different number of images and different number of points measured on the building edges 1...|$|R

40|$|Airborne LiDAR {{technology}} draws {{increasing interest}} in large-scale 3 D urban modeling in recent years. 3 D Li-DAR data typically has no texture information.

Puta-tive line segment correspondences are obtained by matching 3 CS features detected from both <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> and 3 D Li-DAR data. Outliers are removed with a two-level RANSAC algorithm that integrates local and global processing to im-prove robustness and efficiency.

40|$|<b>Aerial</b> <b>images</b> have {{features}} of high resolution, complex background, and usually require {{large amounts of}} calculation, however, most algorithms used in matching of <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> adopt the shallow hand-crafted features expressed as floating-point descriptors (e. g., SIFT (Scale-invariant Feature Transform), SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features)), which may suffer from poor matching speed and are not well represented in the literature. Here, we propose a novel Local Deep Hashing Matching (LDHM) method for matching of <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> with large size and with lower complexity or fast matching speed. The basic idea of the proposed algorithm is to utilize the deep network model in the local area of the <b>aerial</b> <b>images,</b> and study the local features, {{as well as the}} hash function of the images. Firstly, according to the course overlap rate of <b>aerial</b> <b>images,</b> the algorithm extracts the local areas for matching to avoid the processing of redundant information. Secondly, a triplet network structure is proposed to mine the deep {{features of}} the patches of the local image, and the learned features are imported to the hash layer, thus obtaining the representation of a binary hash code. Thirdly, the constraints of the positive samples to the absolute distance are added {{on the basis of the}} triplet loss, a new objective function is constructed to optimize the parameters of the network and enhance the discriminating capabilities of image patch features. Finally, the obtained deep hash code of each image patch is used for the similarity comparison of the image patches in the Hamming space to complete the matching of <b>aerial</b> <b>images.</b> The proposed LDHM algorithm evaluates the UltraCam-D dataset and a set of actual <b>aerial</b> <b>images,</b> simulation result demonstrates that it may significantly outperform the state-of-the-art algorithm in terms of the efficiency and performance...|$|R

40|$|An {{adaptive}} denoising method utilizing weighted least-square (WLSQ) {{is proposed}} for an aberration measurement (AM) method based on <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> (AI). In the aberration measurement process, the WLSQ method is employed {{to obtain the}} principal component coefficients which are used for extracting the Zernike coefficients. In this paper, we also provide a noise model according to the actual <b>aerial</b> <b>images.</b> Based on this noise model, a simplified weighting factor for the WLSQ method is also proposed. Because of the adaptive and lossless denoising ability of the proposed method, more accurate Zernike coefficients can be extracted from <b>aerial</b> <b>images.</b> Compared with the aberration measurement techniques based on principal component analysis of <b>aerial</b> <b>images</b> (AMAI-PCA), the proposed method can enhance the accuracy by more than 30 % when the range of Zernike aberrations is within 0. 1 lambda. The experiment also shows that the proposed method can detect the aberration shift more accurately. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Therefore, the applicability of 8 state-of-the-art object proposals methods used to generate a set of candidate regions and of both detectors is examined. Relevant adaptations of the object proposals methods are provided. To overcome shortcomings of the original approach in case of handling small instances, we further propose our own network that clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for vehicle detection in <b>aerial</b> <b>images.</b> All experiments are performed on two publicly available datasets to account for differing characteristics such as ground sampling distance, number of objects per image and varying backgrounds...|$|R
