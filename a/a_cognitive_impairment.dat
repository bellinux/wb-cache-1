40|$|This {{discussion}} paper presents {{some of the}} key issues surrounding the use of restrictive interventions for people with <b>a</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> or mental illness. The paper provides the legislative context for the use of restrictive interventions in Victoria, reviews the factors associated with their use and raises three key areas for reform. In this paper, restrictive interventions are defined as the deliberate or unconscious use of coercive power to restrain or limit an individual’s freedom of action or movement. These include chemical, environmental, mechanical and physical restraint, and seclusion. Background The Office of the Public Advocate (OPA) is an independent statutory body with legislative powers under Victoria’s Guardianship and Administration Act 1986. OPA is dedicated to upholding the rights and interests of Victorians with <b>a</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> or mental illness, and works to eliminate abuse, neglect and exploitation. OPA addresses this mission through a variety of advocacy, guardianship and investigation services. OPA also undertakes research and policy work that aims {{to improve the lives of}} people with disabilities. OPA’s Advocate/Guardian Program provides guardianship, investigation and individual advocacy services to people with <b>a</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> or mental illness. Guardianship orders and referrals for investigation are made by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) under the Guardianship and Administration Act 1986. The advocacy component of the Advocate/Guardian program derives its authority from the powers given to the Public Advocate under the same Act. Restrictive interventions are a key issue facing OPA Advocate/Guardians...|$|E

Method: A critical, systematic, review of review method was used. Five large electronic databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, and the Cochrane electronic library, were searched. The search terms ‘falls’, ‘rehabilitation’, ‘falls prevention’, ‘interventions’, ‘cognitive impairment’, ‘dementia’, and ‘Alzheimer’s disease’, were used. All available reviews were marked against predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: There were seven reviews which met the inclusion criteria. Only one of the included reviews had a homogenous population of adults with <b>a</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment.</b> Exercise was the most commonly reported intervention, included in 91 studies and all seven reviews. Multifactorial and multicomponent falls prevention programmes were also frequently reported. Reports of efficacy were inconsistent for all interventions. Conclusion: Evidence for falls prevention interventions for adults with cognitive impairment is varied and inconclusive. When compared to literature for falls interventions in healthy older adults, both primary and synthesis studies in older adults with cognitive impairment are lacking in quality, number and homogeneity of sample population and interventions. Promising results are emerging but clinical recommendations cannot be made at this time...|$|E
