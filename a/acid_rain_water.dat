40|$|Mercury (Hg) is a toxic element which bioaccumulates in {{the food}} chain when {{methylated}} and poses a health risk to the human population mainly through fish consumption. It is released into the environment through both natural and anthropogenic processes. Remediation of river systems contaminated with Hg presents challenges due to complexities associated with dynamic transport and deposition processes and cyclic methylation. The South River watershed in Virginia, USA contains elevated concentrations of Hg within sediment and floodplain soils {{as a result of}} historical releases from a textile manufacturing plant from 1929 - 1950. Methylation of Hg is a bacterially mediated process which is controlled by the availability of electron donors, electron acceptors and Hg, amongst other factors. To evaluate the factors controlling Hg methylation at the South River site, four column experiments were conducted that involved saturating site sediments with South River water, followed by subjecting the columns to influent solution containing differing organic carbon and sulfate amendments. These amendments included acetate, lactate, and lactate combined with excess SO 42 - and the production of MeHg relative to a control was monitored both spatially and temporally. Production of MeHg was observed in all four columns, with the lowest mass found in the effluent generated by the control column (8. 7 ng L- 1), and a slightly higher mass in the acetate and lactate amended column effluents (53. 7 ng L- 1 and 30. 1 ng L- 1 reached respectively). The aqueous MeHg in the column amended with lactate and SO 42 - reached a maximum of 4910 ng L- 1 near the output of the column. The results from these column experiments suggest that excess SO 42 - did not inhibit methylation under saturated flow conditions in the South River sediments. The bacterial species Desulfovibrio putealis, Geobacter spp., Desulfobacterium and Desulfosporosinus were identified in the column sediments and are potential contributors to the observed Hg methylation. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential removal of Hg and MeHg from sediment pore water. The experiments consisted of two columns connected in series. The first column contained Hg-bearing sediment with South River water as an influent solution to provide a source of Hg for the treatment column. The effluent from the first column was then connected to a treatment column which contained 1 : 1 volume ratio of biochar and silica sand. This treatment column was loaded with Hg for 182 pore volumes, disconnected, and then subjected to new influent solutions consisting of first background river water and then simulated <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> <b>water.</b> The purpose was to determine the potential of the biochar material to retain Hg under saturated flow conditions. No significant release of Hg was observed in the column effluent with the South River water. After the influent was switched to simulated <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> (pH ~ 4. 6), there was an increase in Hg concentrations in the column effluent for one sampling period, but then the unfiltered and 0. 45 m filtered Hg concentrations returned to < 8. 5 ng L- 1. Total Hg extractions on the biochar column material at four locations suggested {{that the majority of the}} Hg in the column resided in the first 5 cm of material even after influent perturbations, with a maximum of 0. 26 g g- 1 dry weight in the 2 cm closest to the influent. Mercury sequential extraction results on the biochar material at the termination of the column revealed the majority (67 %) of the Hg on the biochar material was removed with 12 M HNO 3 (F 4 fraction), followed by 0. 1 M KOH (F 3 fraction) at 31 %. Less than 1. 2 % of the THg was removed after subjecting the biochar material to deionized water (F 1 fraction) and 0. 01 M HCl + 0. 1 M CH 3 COOH (F 2 fraction). A solid-phase analysis of MeHg on the same biochar material resulted in a concentration of 0. 20 ng g- 1 dry weight, or < 0. 08 % of total solid-phase Hg. These results suggest that application of biochar may represent an effective approach for treating Hg in passive flow through systems. 1 yea...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe {{management}} {{and disposal of}} huge volumes of coal combustion by products such as fly ash has constituted a major challenge to the environment. In most cases due to the inadequate alternative use of coal fly ash, the discarded waste is stored in holding ponds, slag heaps, or stock piled in ash dumps. This practice has raised concerns on the prospect of inorganic metals release {{to the surface and}} groundwater {{in the vicinity of the}} ash dump. Acceptable scientific studies are lacking to determine the best ash disposal practices. Moreover, knowledge about the mobility patterns of inorganic species as a function of mineralogical association or pH susceptibility of the dry disposed ash dump under natural weathering conditions are scarce in the literature. Fundamental understanding of chemical interactions of dry disposed ash with ingressed CO 2 from atmosphere, percolating rain water and brine irrigation within ash disposal sites were seen as key areas requiring investigation. The mineralogical association of inorganic species in the dry disposed ash cores can be identified and quantified. This would provide a basis for understanding of chemical weathering, mineralogical transformations or mobility patterns of these inorganic species in the dry ash disposal scenario. The current study therefore aims to provide a comprehensive characterisation of weathered dry disposed ash cores, to reveal mobility patterns of chemical species as a function of depth and age of ash, with a view to assessing the potential environmental impacts. Fifty-nine samples were taken from 3 drilled cores obtained respectively from the 1 year, 8 year and 20 -year-old sections of sequentially dumped, weathered, dry disposed ash in an ash dump site at Tutuka - a South African coal burning power station. The core samples were characterized using standard analytical procedures viz: X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) techniques, Scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and Acid neutralisation capacity (ANC) test. A modified sequential extraction (SE) method was used in this study. The chemical partitioning, mobility and weathering patterns in 1 year, 8 year and 20 -year-old sections of the ash dump were respectively investigated using this modified sequential extraction scheme. The sequence of the extractions was as follows: (1) water soluble, (2) exchangeable, (3) carbonate, (4) iron and manganese and (5) residual. The results obtained from the 5 steps sequential extraction scheme were validated with the total metal content of the original sample using mass balance method. The distribution of major and trace elements in the different liquid fractions obtained after each step of sequential extraction of the 59 drilled core samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). The data generated for various ash core samples were explored for the systematic analysis of mineralogical transformation and change in ash chemistry with ageing of the ash. Furthermore, the data was analyzed to reveal the impact of ingressed CO 2 from atmosphere, infiltrating rain water and brine irrigation on the chemistry of ash core samples. Major mineral phases in original ash core samples prior to extraction are quartz (SiO 2) and mullite (Al 2 O 3 · 2 SiO 2). Other minor mineral phases identified were hematite (Fe 2 O 3), calcite (CaCO 3), lime (CaO), anorthite (CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8), mica (Ca (Mg, Al) 3 (Al 3 Si) O 10 (OH) 2), and enstatite (Mg 2 Si 2 O 6). X-ray diffraction results show significant loss of crystallinity in the older ash cores. The presence of minor phases of calcite and mica in dry disposed ash cores are attributed to reduction in the pore water pH due to hydration, carbonation and pozzolanic reactions. The X-ray diffraction technique was unable to detect Fe-oxyhydroxide phase and morealuminosilicate phases in ash core samples due to their low abundance and amorphous character. X-ray fluorescence results of the original ash core samples showed the presence of major oxides, such as SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3, while CaO, K 2 O, TiO 2, Na 2 O, MnO, MgO, P 2 O 5, and SO 3 occur in minor concentrations. The ratio of SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 classified the original core samples prior to extraction as a silico-aluminate class F fly ash. The ternary plot of major elements in 1 -year-old ash core samples was both sialic and ferrocalsialic but 8 year and 20 -year-old ash core samples were sialic in chemical composition. It is noteworthy that the mass % of SiO 2 varies through the depth of the core with an increase of nearly 3 %, to 58 mass % of SiO 2 at a depth of 6 m in the 1 -year-old core whereas in the case of the 8 -year-old core a 2 % increase of SiO 2 to a level of 57. 5 mass % can be observed at levels between 4 - 8 m, showing dissolution of major components in the matrix of older ash cores [...] The Na 2 O content of the Tutuka ash cores was low and varied between 0. 6 - 1. 1 mass % for 1 -year-old ash cores to around 0. 6 - 0. 8 mass % for 8 -year-old ash cores. Sodium levels were higher in 1 -year-old ash cores compared to 8 year and 20 -year-old ashcores. Observed trends indicate that quick weathering of the ash (within a year) leached out Na+ from the ash dump. No evidence of Na+ encapsulation even though the ash dump was brine irrigated. Thus the dry disposal ash placement method does not result in a sustainable salt sink for Na-containing species over time. The total content of each of the elements in 1 year and 20 -year-old ash cores was normalised with their total content in fresh ash from same power station to show enrichment and depletion factor. Major elements such as K+, Mn showed enrichment in 1 -year-old ash cores whereas Al, Si, Na+, Ti, Ca, Mg, S and Fe showed depletion due to over time erosion. Trace elements such as Cr, Sr, P, Ba, Pb, V and Zn showed enrichment but Ni, Y, Zr showed depletion attributed to over time erosion. In 20 -year-old ash cores, major elements such as Al, Na+ and Mn showed enrichment while Si, K+, Fe, Mg and Ca showed depletion highlighting their mobility. Trends indicated intensive flushing of major soluble components such as buffering constituents (CaO) by percolating rain water. The 1 -year-old and 20 -year-old coal ash cores showed a lower pH and greater loss/depletion of the soluble buffering constituents than the 2 -week-old placed ash, indicating significant chemical weathering within a year. Based on ANC results the leaching behaviours of Ca, Mg, Na+, K+, Se, Cr, and Sr were found to be controlled by the pH of the leachant indicating high mobility of major soluble species in the ash cores when in contact with slightly <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> <b>water.</b> Other investigated toxic metals such as As, Mo and Pb showed amphoteric behaviour with respect to the pH of the leachant. Chemical alterations and formation of transient minor secondary mineral phases was found to have a significant effect on the acid susceptibility and depletion pattern of chemical species in the core ash samples when compared to fresh ash. These ANC results correlated well with the data generated from the sequential extraction scheme. Based on sequential extraction results elements, showed noticeable mobility in the water soluble, exchangeable and carbonate fractions due to adsorption and desorption caused by variations in the pore water pH. In contrast, slight mobility of elements in the Fe and Mn, and residual fractions of dry disposed fly ashes are attributed to the co-precipitation and dissolution of minor amount of less soluble secondary phase overtime. The 1 -year-old dry disposed ash cores were the least weathered among the 3 drilled ash cores. Therefore low concentration of toxic metals in older ash cores were ascribed to extensive weathering with slower release from residual mineral phases over time. Elements were found to associate with different mineral phases depending on the age or depth of the core samples showing greater heterogeneity in dispersion. For instance the average amount of total calcium in different mineral associations of 1 -year-old ash cores is as follows; water soluble (10. 2 %), exchangeable (37. 04 %), carbonate (37. 9 %), Fe and Mn (7. 1 %) and residual (2. 97 %). The amount of total Na+ in different mineral phases of 1 -year-old ash cores followed this trend: water soluble (21 %), exchangeable (11. 26 %), carbonate (2. 6 %), Fe and Mn (4. 7 %) and residual (53. 9 %). The non-leachable portion of the total Na+ content (namely that contained in the residual fraction) in the 1 -year-old ash core samples under conditions found in nature ranged between 5 - 91 %. This non-leachable portion of the Na+ showed the metastability of the mineral phases with which residual Na+ associates. Results showed older ash cores are enriched in toxic elements. Toxic elements such as As, B, Cr, Mo and Pb are enriched in the residual fraction of older ash cores. For instance As concentration in the residual fraction varied between 0. 0003 - 0. 00043 mg kg- 1 for 1 -year-old ash cores to around 0. 0003 - 0. 0015 mg kg- 1 for 20 -year-old ash cores. This suggests that the older ash is enriched in toxic elements hence dust from the ash dump would be toxic to human health. The knowledge of mobility and ecotoxicological significance of coal fly ash is needed when considering its disposal or reuse in the environment. The mobility and ecotoxicology of inorganic metals in coal fly ash are determined by (i) mineralogical associations of inorganic species (ii) in-homogeneity in the ash dumps (iii) long and short term exposure to ingress CO 2 and percolating rain water. Management issues such as inconsistent placement of ash in the dumps, poor choice of ash dump site, in-homogeneity in brine irrigation, no record of salt load put on the ash dumps and lack of proper monitoring requires improvement. The thesis provides justification for the use of the modified sequential extraction scheme as a predictive tool and could be employed in a similar research work. This thesis also proved that the dry ash disposal method was not environmental friendly in terms of overall leaching potential after significant chemical weathering. Moreover the study proved that the practice of brine co-disposal or irrigation on ash dumps is not sustainable as the ash dump did not act as a salt sink. South Afric...|$|E

Because of the possible environmental impact of lead leaching from bullets, this project was initiated to investigate the usefulness of electrochemical methods for measuring corrosion rates of bullets in soil. The electrolyte was soil taken from a Southern army training facility. A number of environmental conditions were simulated (<b>rain</b> <b>water,</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rain,</b> sea <b>water,</b> and a sea water/acid rain mixture) at moisture contents of 15 % and saturation. The validity of using electrochemical techniques for measuring bullet corrosion {{has been established in}} this research. Corrosion current was observed to be very dependent on environmental conditions. The rate of corrosion was found to increase with decreasing pH and increasing chloride and moisture contents. High soil resistance and a relatively less negative value for corrosion potential were found to be associated with low corrosion rates. This is an important result since both soil resistivity and potential can be readily measured under field conditions. Additional laboratory and field studies are needed to obtain further insight into the bullet corrosion problem, including additional electrochemical tests, weight loss measurements, chemical analyses of soils, and other soil measurements...|$|R

Simulation experiment was also conducted to assess impacts of synthetic <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> on quality of water samples collected from the study site. The results showed that currently major water quality parameters are {{in accordance with the}} permit limits laid out by National Standards. Additional eco-toxicological test results suggested that the water be little either acutely or chronically toxic to the tested organism, Daphnia carinata. However, water samples affected by synthetic <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> showed strongly acute toxicity to Daphnia carinata when the mixing ratio of synthetic <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> to wetland <b>water</b> reach a value of density. It suggests that long-term impacts of acid precipitation degrade the water quality in the study site and possibly impede the development of a healthy wetland ecosystem in the Nansha Wetland Park...|$|R

Toxicity of the runoff from the catchments at the RAIN-project, was tested with 5 strains of brown trout. The chemical composition of runoff water from the clean site {{has proved to be}} more toxin than water from the untreated, neighbouring site. The higher toxicity levels after excluding <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> is assumed to be caused by reduced calcium concentrations in the runoff, while the pH and aluminium levels still were toxin.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of acid deposition and the function of forest on fresh water environments, we carried out field observations of the <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> and mountain stream water quality in Kasugayama Premeval Forest, Nara Pref. from June to December 2005. The {{results showed that the}} average of pH in <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> during the monitoring period was 4. 7. Therefore, {{it was found that the}} <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> which pH showed a value below 5. 6 was often observed in Nara City by our field observation. Neither increasing nor decreasing trends were found for pH, alkalinity and each ionic concentration of mountain water during the period of this study. It was thought that Kasugayama Premeval Forest has acid buffer ability because the alkalinity of river water showed a value over 0. 2 meq/l. However, there is a future risk of acidification of the stream water due to an increase in the acids because the <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> was observed. Consequently, the longterm monitoring was necessary...|$|R

40|$|During {{the animal}} production, which is {{increasingly}} expanding, {{it comes to}} harmful gas emissions. These emissions relate to both greenhouse and odorous gases emissions. The resulting volatile compounds {{also contribute to the}} formation of <b>acid</b> <b>rain,</b> eutrophication of <b>water</b> aquens and soils, corrosion in livestock buildings and damage of the ozone layer. Considering the existing problem, solutions neutralizing the impact of animal production on the environment, are being looked for. Moreover, numerous activities in the way of nutritional and technological solutions are undertaken. Nutritional techniques are based on diet modification and require continuous monitoring of livestock animals. On the other hand, technological solutions are taking action to reduce emissions of gases from livestock buildings and slurry management. The proposed ways of disposing slurry result in different effects in terms of reduction of dangerous gases. They require the implementation of additional actions leading, among other things, to the proper animal waste disposal...|$|R

The aim of this research was to determine the effect of mulberry plants that have been exposed to <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> to the percentage of cocoon defects and type of defects in C- 301 and BS- 09 races of Bombyxmori L. <b>Acid</b> <b>rain</b> that to applied on mulberry plant for 5 weeks was a modification of <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> that occurred in Sidoarjo East Java, Indonesia. A total of 720 individuals of newly hatched silkworm were used in early research. Larvae fed by mulberry leaves that had been treated with artificial <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> in different levels of pH, i. e. pH's of 7. 0 (well water as control), 6. 2 (normal rain), and 4. 6 (<b>acid</b> <b>rain).</b> Cocoon defects and type of cocoon defect were observed. Data were analyzed using multivariate ANOVA. The results showed that the treatments had no significant effect (P > 0. 05) on defective cocoon percentage. Treatment of pH 7. 0, 6. 2, 4. 6 had defective cocoons of 21. 34 %, 12. 94 %, 11. 2 %, respectively in race C- 301 and 18. 49 %, 15 %, 15. 26 %, respectively in race BS- 09. Meanwhile, cocoon defect types in race C- 301 and BS- 09 were outer defects consisting of printed, outside stained, malformed, very small, double cocoons, and inner defect consist of thin-end and inside stained cocoons.
