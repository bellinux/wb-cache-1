500|$|Kemp was a {{voracious}} reader, and {{his political}} beliefs were founded in early readings of Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative, Ayn Rand's libertarian novels, such as The Fountainhead, and Friedrich von Hayek's The Constitution of Liberty. He also brought from his football career a belief in racial equality, which came from playing football with black teammates: Kemp said, [...] "I wasn't there with Rosa Parks or Dr. King or John Lewis. But I am here now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> yell from the rooftops about {{what we need to}} do." [...] Kemp's football colleagues confirmed this influence: John Mackey explained that [...] "the huddle is colorblind." ...|$|E
500|$|Nani celebrates with a [...] "mortal" [...] ("Leap of death"), {{similar to}} that of Obafemi Martins and Lomana LuaLua. The celebration derives from Nani's {{background}} in capoeira, which he used to practice as a child. For a while, it was reported that United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had banned Nani's celebration due to fear for his safety. Nani denounced the reports in August 2007, stating it was [...] "not true" [...] and that [...] "Ferguson has never spoken to me about this subject <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> continue to celebrate goals in this way. The conversations he has had with me are normal conversations, like he has with all players".|$|E
500|$|As {{the likely}} Democratic presidential {{candidate}} for 1892, former president Grover Cleveland, was a staunch opponent of free silver, Tillman attacked Cleveland. Most of the South Carolina delegation, including Tillman, voted against Cleveland at the convention, {{but when the}} former president was nominated, the governor worked to deliver South Carolina for Cleveland by an overwhelming margin. Cleveland was elected, but the new president was offended by Tillman's earlier attacks, and denied the governor any role in patronage in South Carolina, entrusting it to Senator Matthew Butler and other remaining Conservatives. Tillman's inability to provide federal jobs for supporters {{made it more difficult}} for him to hold his coalition together. Tillman continued his verbal assaults, stating that Cleveland [...] "is an old bag of beef <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Washington with a pitchfork and prod him in his old fat ribs"—thus popularizing Tillman as [...] "Pitchfork Ben".|$|E

500|$|... "Can't Stop" [...] has a {{high pitched}} {{keyboard}} sound embedded in between {{the sound of a}} drum machine and clarinet. The lyrics essentially refer to the idea that [...] "I want my man <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get him whatever". Rooksby noticed that the instrumental break in the song repeats the chorus, with a synth line added on the top. He felt that [...] "Can't Stop", at 4:45 length, was {{a good example of the}} division of Madonna's songs between dance music—where the length is important—and the requirement of classic pop songs, which can vary from two minutes to four minutes. J. Randy Taraborrelli, in his book , described Faure's song [...] "24 Hours" [...] as a slow track which fails to build up momentum. Joe Brown from The Washington Post described Davidson's [...] "Turn it Up" [...] as consisting of a slow background synth, that transforms into a rapidly progressing beat, with Davidson's singing reminiscent of the Beastie Boys.|$|E
500|$|Despite his radical views, Haywood {{emerged from}} the trial with a {{national}} reputation. Eugene Debs called him [...] "the Lincoln of Labor." [...] Along with his colorful background and appearance, he {{was known for his}} blunt statements about capitalism. [...] "The capitalist has no heart," [...] he often said, [...] "but harpoon him in the pocketbook and you will draw blood." [...] Another time, he began a speech by noting, [...] "Tonight I am going to speak on the class struggle <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make it so plain that even a lawyer can understand it." [...] Yet Haywood also had a flair for dangerous hyperbole that, when quoted in newspapers, was used to justify wholesale arrests of IWW strikers. [...] "Confiscate! That's good!" [...] he often said. [...] "I like that word. [...] It suggests stripping the capitalist, taking something away from him. [...] But there {{has got to be a}} good deal of force to this thing of taking." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, Eastwood {{stated that}} he would be voting for John McCain, citing {{the fact that he had}} known McCain since he {{returned}} to the US in 1973 as a recently released POW. Eastwood said of McCain: [...] "I met him years ago when he first came back from Vietnam. This was back when (Ronald) Reagan was the governor of California and he had a big function for all of the prisoners of war who were released. I thought he was a terrific guy, a real American hero." [...] Nevertheless, Eastwood wished Barack Obama well upon his subsequent victory saying, [...] "Obama is my president now <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be wishing him the very best because it is what is best for all of us." [...] Eastwood stated in 2010 of President Obama: [...] "I think he's a nice fella and I enjoyed watching him come along and I enjoyed watching him campaign and win the job. But I'm not a fan of what he's doing at the moment.... I just don't think he's governing. I don't think he's surrounded himself with the people he could have surrounded himself with." ...|$|E

500|$|According to The Tombstone Epitaph, [...] "Wyatt Earp {{stood up}} and fired in rapid succession, as cool as a cucumber, and was not hit." [...] Morgan Earp fired almost immediately, as Billy Clanton drew his gun right-handed. Morgan's shot hit Billy in the right wrist, {{disabling}} his hand. Forced to shift the revolver to his left hand, Clanton continued shooting until he emptied the gun. Virgil and Wyatt were now firing. Morgan Earp tripped and fell over a newly buried waterline and fired from the ground. Wyatt shot Frank McLaury in the abdomen, and Frank took his horse by its reins and struggled across Fremont Street. He {{tried and failed to}} grab his rifle from the scabbard but lost control of the horse. [...] Frank crossed Fremont Street firing his revolver instead. Frank and Holliday exchanged shots as Frank moved across Fremont Street, and Frank hit Holliday in his pistol pocket, grazing him. Holliday followed him, exclaiming, [...] "That son of a bitch has shot me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill him." [...] Morgan Earp picked himself up and also fired at Frank. [...] Frank fell to the sidewalk {{on the east side of}} Fremont Street.|$|E
500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure out, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give you a little more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted {{that he would like to}} take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E
2500|$|Late in a tied {{game against}} the Seattle SuperSonics, Bird told SuperSonics forward Xavier McDaniel, who was {{guarding}} him, [...] "I'm going to get [...] right here <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bury it in your face." [...] As McDaniel remembers it, he responded by saying, [...] "I know, I'll be waiting." [...] After a timeout, Bird made two baseline cuts, then posted in the exact spot he had indicated to McDaniel, paused, turned, and made it in his face. He finished up the sequence by telling McDaniel, [...] "I didn't mean to leave two seconds on the clock." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1927, Beban began {{assisting}} aspiring {{actors to}} break into the motion picture business. [...] He described his goal {{in an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times:"There is no agony so poignant as the feeling that one has the spark of genius with no opportunity to satisfy that ambition that goes with it. [...] I know, because I have had my own struggles. [...] The stage and screen have been good to me. [...] I have accumulated all the money I need, for a few years at least, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> devote at least a year of my life to helping young men and women of talent who are denied the chance to display it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Luther {{recalled}} his first speech on sobriety. “My relations, {{you all know}} that I am {{to take care of}} you while going across the big water to another country, and all the time we are to stay there. [...] I have heard that when anyone joins this show, about the first thing he thinks of is getting drunk. [...] I understand that regulations of the Buffalo Bill show require that no Indian shall be given any liquor. [...] You all know that I do not drink, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> keep you all from it. [...] Don’t think because you may be closely related to me I will shield you, for I will not. [...] I will report to Colonel Cody immediately anyone I find drinking.” ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{week after}} the event, The Wall Street Journal wrote that King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia {{delivered}} a second rebuke in one week to Chávez from a king, when he reminded Chávez that oil {{should not be used}} as a tool for conflict. The remarks came minutes after Chávez called for OPEC to [...] "assert itself as an active political agent" [...] at the OPEC summit in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh. In a followup at the OPEC summit, Reuters wrote that [...] "Spain's king cannot shut Chavez up but bladder can", and that Chávez said to a throng of reporters at the OPEC summit, [...] "For a while now, I have needed {{to go to the bathroom}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pee ...

2500|$|About this time, Robeson's {{belief that}} trade {{unionism}} {{was crucial to}} civil rights became a mainstay of his political beliefs as he became proponent of the union activist Revels Cayton. Robeson was later called before the Tenney Committee where he responded to questions about his affiliation with the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) by testifying {{that he was not}} a member of the CPUSA. Nevertheless, two organizations with which Robeson was intimately involved, the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) and the CAA, were placed on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations (AGLOSO). Subsequently, he was summoned before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and when questioned about his affiliation with the Communist Party, he refused to answer, stating: [...] "Some of the most brilliant and distinguished Americans are about to go to jail for the failure to answer that question, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> join them, if necessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "On {{the stage}} sat four Indian men, {{one of whom}} was Sitting Bull. [...] There were two women and two {{children}} with them. [...] A white man came on stage and introduced Sitting Bull as the man who had killed General Custer (which, of course, was absolutely false). [...] Sitting Bull arose and addressed the audience in the Sioux tongue, as he did not speak nor understand English. [...] He said, ‘My friends, white people, we Indians are on our way to Washington to see the Grandfather, or President of the United States. [...] I see so many white people and what they are doing, that it makes me glad to know that some day my children will be educated also. [...] There is no use fighting any longer. [...] The buffalo are all gone, as well {{as the rest of the}} game. [...] Now I am going to shake the hand of the Great Father at Washington, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell him all these things.’ Then Sitting Bull sat down. He never even mentioned General Custer’s name.|$|E
2500|$|When Ament {{became aware}} of the {{criticism}} of his activities and the subsequent controversy, he was affected adversely. Ament admitted the strain {{in a letter to his}} wife on Sunday, 27 January 1901: [...] "I am doing what I do not recall that I ever did before, remaining at home deliberately and missing all the services. I need the rest and felt that it was imperative. You see there is no let up for me. It is a constant strain from morning till night." [...] Missionary colleague Miss Nellie Naomi Russell (born Ontonagon, Michigan, 31 March 1862; died 22 August 1911 in China) records: ...when he was weary in body and mind, there came like a thunderbolt the article by Mark Twain in the North American Review. I remember that day I went to his study on a matter of business, and found him sitting at his desk as if stricken at the heart. I exclaimed, [...] "What is it? Are you ill?" [...] "If I am what that man says, I am not fit for you to speak to me ! I feel as though I should go off and hide myself in a cave in the mountain, never again to be seen of man." [...] I thought he had gone out of his head with all his cares, and I replied, [...] " [...] What you need is rest and a doctor, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> send for one." [...] If the writer of that article could have seen how he suffered he would have felt that every cent he received for that article would be a red hot coal of fire. A brave, masterful man he was, ever ready to relieve, not to add to the sum of human suffering, and while in some things he may have been unwise, his mistakes, whatever they may have been, were of the head and not the heart.|$|E
