5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, <b>and</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E

25|$|At Martinsville, Busch had bad luck. He crashed {{early in}} the race and after {{repairing}} his damages, successfully took the lucky dog free pass. But later, on lap 487, while running many laps down, Busch lost his brakes in turn 1 <b>and</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> wall hard enough to cause his engine to burst into flames. This brought out a 6-minute red flag. Busch was uninjured.|$|E

25|$|In Game 6, Pippen {{made the}} {{signature}} play of his career. Midway {{in the third}} quarter, Pippen received the ball during a Bulls fast break, charging toward the basket. As center Patrick Ewing jumped up to defend the shot, Pippen fully extended the ball out, absorbing body contact and a foul from Ewing, <b>and</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> ball through the hoop with Ewing's hand in his face. Pippen landed several {{feet away from the}} basket along the baseline, incidentally walking over a fallen Ewing. He then made taunting remarks to both Ewing and then Spike Lee, who was standing courtside supporting the Knicks, thus receiving a technical foul. This extended the Bulls' lead to 17; they won 93–79.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match was}} between Crowbar and Terry Funk for the WCW Hardcore Championship. The match started when Funk ambushed Crowbar backstage. They fought inside a truck, and Funk sent Crowbar through {{a table with}} a hip toss. Crowbar {{attacked}} Funk with a car door, and slammed a door into Funk's head. Funk performed a low blow, <b>and</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> door into Crowbar's head repeatedly. Funk handcuffed Crowbar, and attacked him with the car door and a steel chair. Crowbar fought back with the chair, and performed a slingshot splash to Funk through a table. Funk fought back with chair shots, and pinned Crowbar after a piledriver on the car door to win the match and the title.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{championship}} season, Elliott {{broke his}} wrist {{in a crash}} during testing at Daytona and required relief by Jody Ridley during several races {{in the first part}} of the 1989 season. Elliott won two poles and three races and finished sixth in the championship standings. In 1990, Elliott won one race and two poles and finished fourth in the championship standings. In the 1990 race at Atlanta, Elliott's rear tire changer Mike Rich was killed when Ricky Rudd lost control of his car, spun, <b>and</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> crew member between his car and Elliott's. This forced NASCAR to restrict the cars' speed on pit road. The 1991 season saw Elliott's sponsorship change to Coors Light and the familiar red on the car was replaced with blue. Elliott won once in the Pepsi 400 and won two poles and finished eleventh in the championship standings during his last season with Mellings.|$|E

500|$|Their {{contracts}} {{required them}} to fly with a passenger, so they modified the 1905 Flyer by installing two seats and adding upright control levers. After tests with sandbags in the passenger seat, Charlie Furnas, a helper from Dayton, became the first fixed-wing aircraft passenger on a few short flights May 14, 1908. For safety, and as a promise to their father, Wilbur and Orville did not fly together. However, several newspaper accounts at the time mistakenly took Orville's flight with Furnas as both brothers flying together. Later that day after flying solo seven minutes, Wilbur suffered his worst crash when—still not well-acquainted with the two new control levers—he apparently moved one the wrong way <b>and</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> Flyer into the sand at between [...] He emerged with only bruises and a cut nose, but the accident ended the practice flights—and the airplane's flying career.|$|E
2500|$|A 2001 {{report by}} the Police Ombudsman said that the RUC Special Branch failed to act on prior {{warnings}} <b>and</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> RUC's investigation of the bombing. The RUC has obtained circumstantial and coincidental evidence against some suspects, {{but it has not}} come up with anything to convict anyone of the bombing. Colm Murphy was tried, convicted, and then released after it was revealed that the Gardaí forged interview notes used in the case. Murphy's nephew, Sean Hoey, was also tried and found not guilty. In June 2009, the victims' families won a [...] civil action against four defendants. In April 2014, Seamus Daly was charged with the murders of those killed; however, the case against him was withdrawn in February 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{reversed}} the throttle <b>and</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> airbrakes into emergency stop, but [...] "Ole 382" [...] quickly plowed through a wooden caboose, a car load of hay, another of corn, and halfway through a car of timber {{before leaving the}} track. He had reduced his speed from about [...] to about [...] when he hit. Because Jones stayed on board to slow the train, he was believed to have saved the passengers from serious injury and death – Jones was the only fatality of the collision. His watch stopped {{at the time of}} impact: 3:52 am on April 30, 1900. Popular legend holds that when his body was pulled from the wreckage, his hands still clutched the whistle cord and brake. A stretcher was brought from the baggage car on No. 1, and crewmen of the other trains carried his body to the depot, a half-mile (0.80km) away.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012 and 2013, Menard's {{results were}} similar, scoring 9 top 10s in both seasons and {{finishing}} 16th and 17th in points respectively, {{with only three}} DNF's over the two years. At the 2013 season finale at Homestead Miami Speedway, Menard {{was involved in a}} freak incident, when his right rear wheel caught fire due to rubber from a previous tire issue being wrapped around the rear axle and igniting from a cut brake line. The tire proceed to explode on pit road, sending black smoke in all directions, and ending their day. ESPN analyst Andy Petree described it as [...] "like a bomb went off" [...] during the telecast of the race. In a less infamous incident at Darlington in April of the next year, Menard blew a right front tire <b>and</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> turn 2 wall. Once again on pit road, rubber collected under the car (in addition to fluid leaking from the engine) caught fire and exploded, ending the 27 car's race.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2003, {{several months}} after its {{introduction}} in Europe, Richard Horton, {{the editor of the}} medical journal The Lancet, criticized the way Crestor had been introduced. [...] "AstraZeneca's tactics in marketing its cholesterol-lowering drug, rosuvastatin, raise disturbing questions about how drugs enter clinical practice and what measures exist to protect patients from inadequately investigated medicines," [...] according to his editorial. The Lancet's editorial position is that the data for Crestor’s superiority rely too much on extrapolation from the lipid profile data (surrogate end-points) and too little on hard clinical end-points, which are available for other statins that had been on the market longer. The manufacturer responded by stating that few drugs had been tested so successfully on so many patients. In correspondence published in The Lancet, AstraZeneca's CEO Sir Tom McKillop called the editorial [...] "flawed and incorrect" [...] <b>and</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> journal for making [...] "such an outrageous critique of a serious, well-studied medicine." ...|$|E
