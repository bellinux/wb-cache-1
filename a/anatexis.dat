5000|$|Besides direct {{causes the}} {{particular}} {{characteristics of the}} Bolivian Orocline-Altiplano region are attributed {{to a variety of}} deeper causes. These causes include a local steepening of the subduction angle of Nazca Plate, increased crustal shortening and plate convergence between the Nazca and South American plates, an acceleration in the westward drift of the South American Plate, and a rise in the shear stress between the Nazca and South American plates. This increase in shear stress could in turn be related to the scarcity of sediments in the Atacama trench which is caused by the arid conditions along Atacama Desert. Capitanio et al. attributes the rise of Altiplano and the bending of the Bolivian Orocline to the varying ages of the subducted Nazca Plate with the older parts of the plate subducting at the centre of the orocline. As Andrés Tassara puts it the rigidity of the Bolivian Orocline crust is derivative of the thermal conditions. The crust of the western region (forearc) of the orocline has been cold and rigid, resisting and damming up the westward flow of warmer and weaker ductile crustal material from beneath the Altiplano.

50|$|The {{far-reaching}} {{effects of}} the Variscan orogeny influenced the pyrenean domain in many ways. Of prime importance were the compressional stresses that folded the Paleozoic sediments. Several fold generations developed, sometimes superimposing each other. Associated with the folds are schistosities. The Paleozoic sediments and its Precambrian basement were also metamorphosed under high-temperature and low-pressure conditions (HP/LT). In places <b>anatexis</b> was reached, an example being the melting of some Precambrian gneisses of the Prevariscan basement together with their enveloping mica schists. Another important consequence of the orogeny was late-orogenic magmatism emplacing granitoids (granodiorites and biotite granites) of mainly acid but occasionally also of basic composition. Amongst these granitoids are deep-seated, rather diffuse, intrusive bodies associated with migmatites, yet also typical, well-defined plutons often rising into the cores of anticlines within the Variscan fold-belt.

In northern Italy, the effects of magmatic underplating were studied along a traverse through the Strona-Ceneri Zone and the Ivrea Verbano Zone. The studies included a thermal modeling method which split the cross section up into three different sections: the upper crust, the lower crust, and the upper mantle.

The results also showed that final heating began {{at the same time as}} extension in shallower crustal levels, while in deeper parts, extension occurred later than the thermal peak of metamorphism. It was also shown that magmatic underplating during a time period of about thirty million years was strong enough to erase all tectono-metamorphic history in the Ivera Verbano Zone. This information was preserved in the Strona-Ceneri Zone because areas in the upper crust were not affected nearly as much. Other research has been conducted in the Kutch District of Northwest India. It was concluded that the uplift that occurred in the area was due to intrusions of magma in the lower part of the crust. This uplift occurred because of two separate processes. One of these processes is due to magmatic underplating, while the other involves only isostasy. Research has shown that during the Oxfordian Stage a peak transgressive event occurred which was followed by the deposition of shale and sandstone. It is possible that the lower units may represent a decrease in sea level; the sea began to withdraw because of the uplift related to the magmatic underplating.|$|E

Only the volume of melt generated by <b>anatexis</b> is considered; crustal melt segregation, transport and emplacement at higher levels are not included. We find that under a broad range of conditions, influx of mafic magma to the crust is required for substantial <b>anatexis</b> to take place, and once this stops, silicic magmatism dies out rapidly. In many rifts the observed change in type of magmatism from predominantly mafic to silicic during rifting is probably more due to a diminishing potential for mafic magmas to ascend though the crust than to an actual halt in mafic melt generation at depth.

40|$|AbstractThe eastern Karakoram terrane, NW India, records crustal {{evolution}} {{in the core of}} the Himalayan–Tibetan orogen. Recent debate has centred on whether prograde metamorphism, <b>anatexis</b> and leucogranite emplacement were the result of localised shear heating and magma advection within the Karakoram Fault Zone (KFZ) or instead predate the KFZ and were the result of regional tectonometamophic events. Inclusions within andalusite porphyroblasts that grew during 15. 7 Ma leucogranite emplacement have fabrics that are random or discordant to the KFZ matrix foliation, indicating that the KFZ initiated after this time. Therefore, earlier <b>anatexis</b> and metamorphism are the result of regional metamorphic events. Amphibole–plagioclase thermobarometry on a c. 17 Ma migmatite melanosome, later exhumed within a transpressional zone of the KFZ, shows that melting occurred at 688 °C and 522 MPa. Amphibolites record an older kyanite-grade metamorphic event that occurred at 677 – 736 °C and 875 – 1059 MPa. Metapelites also record a kyanite-grade event which is constrained by Ti-in-biotite thermometry to have occurred at 622 °C and > 650 MPa. The tectonometamorphic history of the eastern Karakoram correlates closely with that of the central Karakoram away from the KFZ.

40|$|Upper to {{intermediate}} levels of continental crust, as shaped by Late Hercynian metamorphism and magmatism, are exposed in the Sila nappe (Calabria, S. Italy) after Tertiary tectonics. Direct {{observation of the}} crustal section reveals a composite metamorphic block dominated by low- to high-grade metapelites and meta-arenites, intruded centrally by granitoids. The average thickness of granitoids, estimated on cross-sections and by geobarometry, reaches 9 ± 2 km. Their composition changes with depth from leucogranite to tonalite with increasing colour index. The estimated bulk composition of the Sila nappe is characterised by higher contents of A 1203, REE and Th and lower contents of CaO and Sr than is typical of upper continental crust, reflecting abundant metapelite in the Sila nappe. Comparisons between metasedimentary rocks from the upper and intermediate levels indicate that intracrustal differentiation was determined by <b>anatexis,</b> which favoured A 1203, REE and Th enrichment in medium- to high-grade metapelites.

The amazonitic microcline perthite at Anjanabonoina has a δ 18 O value above 15 ‰, and that at Sakavalana, close to 13 ‰, indicative of formation of the NYF-pegmatite-forming magma by the melting of crustal rocks.

Granitic rocks appear as subhorizontal sheets of megacrystic granodiorite and as lenticular bodies of leucogranite. These formed by in situ <b>anatexis</b> and correspond to melt–restite segregations under two different conditions, namely high melt-fraction {{in the case of}} the granodiorite, and low melt-fraction {{in the case of the}} leucogranites. The leucogranites display large enclaves of sillimanite-rich material, representing the restitic fraction. Granodiorite was generated as consequence of crustal thickening under conditions of T ≈ 750 to 800 °C and P ≈ 4 kbar, coinciding with the second phase of the Hercynian orogeny. After this event, an extensional episode involved smaller degrees of decompression-induced melting, and generated small batches of cordierite leucogranites from an already depleted source. <b>Anatexis</b> was enhanced, in both cases, by shear structures and by the existence of a fertile protolith...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Zircon and {{monazite}} {{from three}} restitic enclaves and one host dacite have been dated by ion microprobe (SHRIMP), {{with the aim}} of characterising their Miocene history and defining the timing relationships between crustal melting and eruption in the high-K calc-alkaline volcanics of the Neogene Volcanic Province of SE Spain. The studied samples are from the volcanic edifices of El Joyazo (Cerro del Hoyazo) and Mazarro´n. Zircons in the enclaves are characterized by a thin euhedral rim overgrowing a detrital core. The corerim boundary is marked by tiny glass inclusions of S-type granitic composition, which attest to the growth of zircon rims during a crustal melting event. At El Joyazo, where lavas erupted at 6. 3 Ma (Zeck and Williams 2002), U-Pb ages of zircon overgrowths define an age of <b>anatexis</b> of 9. 63 ± 0. 26 Ma (95 % c. l.), in agreement with monazite ages of 9. 74 ± 0. 21 Ma (95 % c. l.). At Mazarro´n, the age of <b>anatexis</b> provided by monazite at 9. 13 ± 0. 18 Ma (95 % c. l.) overlaps with tha...|$|E
