She informs him of where he is and allows him to explore his {{memories}} for one last time, but warns him that memories aren't always good. Upon finding a hidden key inside a tree that he had put there in his childhood, Wilson {{opens the door to}} a nearby cabin. Inside he discovers old drawings he and his friend Amelia had made when they were children. He remembers that she made him promise to fly her <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>here</b> when they grew up so she could go to the Big City. Wilson then explores a nearby barn, in which he and Amelia had kissed for the first time.|$|E

2500|$|As {{everyone}} {{is leaving the}} room, Violetta has asked Alfredo to see her. Fearing that the Baron's anger will lead him to challenge Alfredo to a duel, she gently asks Alfredo to leave. Alfredo misunderstands her apprehension and demands that she admit that she loves the Baron. In grief, she makes that admission and, furiously, Alfredo calls the guests to witness {{what he has to}} say (Questa donna conoscete? – [...] "You know this woman?"). He humiliates and denounces Violetta in front of the guests and then throws his winnings at her feet in payment for her services. She faints onto the floor. The guests reprimand Alfredo: Di donne ignobile insultatore, di qua allontanati, ne desti orror! ("Ignoble insulter of women, go <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>here,</b> you fill us with horror!").|$|E
2500|$|Netanyahu's father, Benzion, was a {{professor}} of Jewish history at Cornell University, editor of the Encyclopaedia Hebraica, and a senior aide to Ze'ev Jabotinsky, who remained active in research and writing into his nineties. Regarding the Palestinian people, he stated: [...] "That they won't be able to face [...] the war with us, which will include withholding food from Arab cities, preventing education, terminating electrical power and more. They won't be able to exist, and they will run <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>here.</b> But {{it all depends on}} the war, and whether we will win the battles with them." [...] Netanyahu has dismissed those who note similarities between his relentlessly hawkish views and those of his late father as [...] "psychobabble". For example, David Remnick has written: [...] "To understand Bibi, {{you have to understand the}} father." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "End of Time" [...] is a {{declaration}} of co-dependence; Knowles professes her everlasting love to her romantic interest. As stated by Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic, [...] "At the start, she's stricken by her own emotional vulnerability; by the end, she's empowered by it." [...] The song opens with [...] "spitfire drums" [...] while Knowles sings in an almost distorted fashion, with her vocals layered underneath until a [...] "dramatic explosion". As her vocals continue to build up, Knowles airily chants: [...] "Come take my hand / I won’t let you go / I’ll be your friend / I will love you so deeply / I {{will be the one}} to kiss you at night / I will love you till the end of time." [...] She continues her appeal as she sings to her love interest, [...] "Take you <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>here</b> / There's nothing between us but space and time". On the bridge, Knowles belts her vocal lines over a shooting horn sequence; with her multiple-layered vocals, she commands, [...] "Boy come to me", and towards the end, she repeatedly sings, [...] "Say you’ll never let me go". Knowles [...] "finds the strength in two" [...] as she affirms to her romantic interest, [...] "I just wanna be with you / I just wanna live for you / I'd never let you go!".|$|E

2500|$|Three downtempo ballads follow, called [...] "the kind {{of songs}} you wouldn't {{want to listen}} to at all: the lyrics are boring at best and {{completely}} cliché at worst" [...] by one reviewer. The first, [...] "Don't Forsake Me" [...] is a torch song that was frequently compared to [...] "Too Hurt to Dance" [...] due to its lyrics about heartache. The song follows the retro sound Duffy had been previously known for and was called [...] "indebted to the pre-Beatles era". It was received negatively for [...] "paint too much of a resemblance" [...] to [...] "Warwick Avenue". The title song, which follows, is a love song that was again said to contain 1950s music references. The song features vinyl sounds and is sung to the accompaniment of an acoustic guitar. The final song in the trio of ballads is [...] "Breath Away", a 1960s-inspired ballad about love. Contactmusic.com [...] implied that the song is boring, saying that [...] " [...] hardly does anything to take our breath away", although it was said to [...] "showcase" [...] her vocal talents. Endlessly continues with two more up-tempo songs with a dance-orientated sound: [...] "Lovestruck" [...] and [...] "Girl", both called [...] "sassy" [...] and [...] "playful". The former is a disco song described as having [...] "the brashness of a Bond theme", with [...] "tragic undertones" [...] of a [...] "haunting creation". Lyrically, the song speaks of being so in love you are [...] "sleepless all night long", with the song opening [...] "It's a physical thing we got and I'm in paradise". The lyrical sentiment of [...] "My Boy" [...] is echoed in the latter, with the song being sung [...] "Girl, girl/Stay away, girl/Come back another day, girl/Better still don't come back ever stay <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>here</b> forever." [...] The album's final song, the string-led [...] "Hard for the Heart" [...] continues the soul pop sound of Rockferry and was described as a [...] "soulful pop confection" [...] by Uncut, whilst being labelled as the stand-out song on the album by many reviewers. The song's climax was compared to the song [...] "Hey Jude" [...] (1968) by The Beatles, whilst a reviewer for the BBC asserted that it [...] "unconsciously borrows from Coldplay's [...] "The Scientist"." [...] Entertainment Focus, on the other hand called it a [...] "lost Burt Bacharach classic", and Hammond's production skills were also praised on the song. It also received praise concerning Duffy's voice, something that was a feature of many critics' reviews, with Sputnik Music noting, [...] ""Hard for the Heart" [...] has the singer in an intensely emotional and surprisingly restrained moment. Her beautiful timbre finally gets to shine without choking out the sophisticated and apotheotic production, giving pulse and strength to a strikingly poetic composition." ...|$|E
