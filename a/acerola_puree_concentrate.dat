In this study, the combination between <b>acerola</b> <b>puree</b> and alginate was reinforced with cellulose whiskers (CW) or montmorillonite (MMT) to form nanocomposite edible films (casted on glass plates) and edible coatings (applied on acerola fruit surfaces). Three film/coating dispersions were formulated, based on unfilled alginate–acerola puree (AA), CW-reinforced alginate–acerola puree (CWAA), and MMT-reinforced alginate–acerola puree (MMTAA). Both nanofillers (CW and MMT) reduced {{water vapor permeability}} (WVP) of films. When applied to fresh acerolas, the coatings decreased fruit weight loss, decay incidence, and ripening rates. Ascorbic acid retention by the fruits were favored by the coatings, especially the nanocomposite ones. The MMTAA coating was the most effective in reducing weight loss of acerolas. Moreover, it was the coating which best maintained its red color and the visual acceptance of coated acerolas...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Health {{benefits}} {{obtained from}} consumption {{of fruits and}} vegetables have the potential to improve the lifestyle of individuals. The walnut is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) -rich whole food that is readily available in the U. S and has been shown to potentially reduce risk of Metabolic Syndrome. Furthermore, consumption of polyphenol rich plant-based foods have also been shown to be negatively correlated with the risk of the development of chronic diseases. In Study 1 we tested the hypothesis that addition of walnut and polyphenol-rich foods to a high-fat obesogenic diet (HF) would improve metabolism in male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Mice were provided HF supplemented with walnut (W), or W diet supplemented with blueberry (W+BB), raspberry (W+RB), apple (W+AP), cranberry (W+CB), cherry (W+CH), broccoli (W+BR) and green tea (GT) for 9 weeks. Animals were fed experimental diets ad libitum; body weight, glucose tolerance, liver lipid accumulation, and expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism and inflammation were measured. Glucose tolerance was significantly lower in W+RB when compared to HF, meanwhile W+AP showed an intermediate value between W+RB and HF. A custom-designed focused gene array was used to evaluate expression of 87 different mRNAs. A subset of six groups were evaluated: LF, HF, W, W+RB, W+CH, and W+GT. Finally, a biochemical evaluation of 594 different metabolites was conducted and examined by principle component analysis (PCA). In Study 2 mice were fed experimental diets for ten weeks. Diets were formulated to include a typical dietary level of whole raspberry food products: HF+ raspberry juice concentrate (RJC), HF+ raspberry <b>puree</b> <b>concentrate</b> (RPC), HF+ raspberry fruit powder (RFP), and HF+ raspberry seed extract (RSE). Body weight, glucose tolerance, liver lipid accumulation, and expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism and inflammation were observed. Addition of raspberry food products to high-fat diet reduced body weight gain significantly, particularly for raspberry juice and <b>puree</b> <b>concentrates.</b> Serum insulin and resistin levels were measured and suggest intake of raspberry products and phytochemicals improve glucose control. A histological evaluation of liver tissue indicates a profound increase in liver lipid content in all high-fat fed mice. However, intake of raspberry <b>puree</b> <b>concentrate</b> appeared to reduce liver lipid levels compared to other groups fed high-fat diets. A custom-designed focused gene array was used to evaluate expression of 87 different mRNAs related to hepatic lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, inflammation, nuclear hormone reception action, and other cell signaling pathways We demonstrated that intake of walnut, alone, or in combination with a polyphenol-rich food, and consumption of raspberry and raspberry products, may have significant effects on physiological parameters related to metabolic syndrome and changes in hepatic gene expression levels consistent with an improved metabolic state...|$|R

Mechanical efficiency, reflux limit and trapping are also discussed. The effect of Casson fluid vis-à-vis Newtonian fluid is investigated analytically and numerically too. The result is physically interpreted as that the oesophagus makes more efforts to swallow fluids with higher concentration. It is observed that the pressure is uniformly distributed when an integral number of waves is there in the oesophagus; but it is non-uniform when a non-integral number of waves is present therein. It is further observed that as the plug flow region widens, the pressure difference increases, which indicates that the averaged flow rate will reduce for a Casson fluid. It is also concluded that Casson fluids are more prone to reflux...|$|R

Several {{strawberry}} products: whole fruits, strawberry purees (5 °Brix) and strawberry concentrates (≥ 21 °Brix), {{submitted to}} different processing temperatures (fresh non-pasteurized, enzymatically inactivated and pasteurized) have been characterized {{in terms of}} their organoleptic quality. Quality parameters such as color (L, a, b values, Hue, Chroma, browning index, and anthocyanin content), taste (total soluble solids, acidity, sugars and organic acids profile), nutritional value (vitamin C and polyphenols contents) and aroma (volatile compounds) have been analyzed during 12 months of storage at 2 °C and - 18 °C. Although quality changes showed quite different rates in whole fruits, <b>purees,</b> and <b>concentrates,</b> losses of anthocyanins and vitamin C were the most relevant changes observed during storage. In general, storage temperature had a greater effect on quality maintenance than processing temperature, particularly for anthocyanins and vitamin C contents. Thus, frozen non-pasteurized strawberry purees had significantly higher content of anthocyanins and vitamin C than refrigerated products, either previously submitted to thermal enzymatic inactivation and/or pasteurization, which lose 80 % vitamin C and 40 % anthocyanins after 3 months of storage. On the other hand, the quality standards of the fruits before processing seem to be critical for quality maintenance of the strawberry products. Peer reviewe...|$|R

30|$|Musk lime (Citrus microcarpa) {{from family}} Rutaceae is {{commonly}} found in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Philippines (Abdullah et al. 2012). The health benefits of lime include skin care, eye care, weight loss, good digestion, relief from constipation, and treatment of scurvy. Besides that, the juice is also commonly used as a flavoring ingredient in desserts or as an additive in various food preparations such as fish steak, jams, candies, and marmalade. The pulp of the fruit {{is used as a}} major ingredient in <b>purees,</b> syrups, <b>concentrates,</b> and beverages. The peel of musk lime is rough and usually discarded. Thus, utilization of musk lime peel for AC production is a way of placing value on this waste thereby saving disposal cost. As a result of the hazardous health effects of MG dye, the present study is aimed at removing this dye from wastewater using musk lime peel as adsorbent by employing a central composite design (CCD) in response surface methodology (RSM) Design Expert software version 7.1. 5.1 (STAT-EASE Inc., Minneapolis, USA). RSM was selected to elucidate the simultaneous effects of parameters on the adsorption process. The multiple regression analysis technique in the RSM was utilized to develop the equations and empirical models correlating the dye removal efficiency and activated carbon yield to three adsorption variables. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to judge the adequacy of the model. The optimized conditions developed from the model were validated experimentally and the feasibility of LPAC for MG dye removal was obtained.|$|R
40|$|In {{the food}} industry, berries are {{conventionally}} processed into juices, jams, jellies, <b>purées,</b> <b>concentrates</b> and extracts. Phenolic compounds {{play an important}} role in the health effects and sensory properties of berry products. The factors influencing the stability of phenolic compounds are the type of process and process parameters, the food matrix (pH, presence of oxygen, enzymes, pectins, sugars and metals), and storage conditions. Anthocyanins are especially vulnerable during processing and storage, resulting in pigment degradation and formation of anthocyanin-tannin/flavan- 3 -ol polymers. Flavonol glycosides, ellagitannins and derivatives of phenolic acids are hydrolyzed into free aglycones and acids, and the degree of polymerization (DP) of proanthocyanidins is lowered. The decomposition of phenolic compounds, especially anthocyanins, may compromise the sensory and nutritional food quality. Processing berries into juices results in 20 – 30 % of press residue, producing significant ecological problems when discarded as waste. The press residue contains high amounts of phenolic compounds and could be a valuable source of bioactive ingredients. Thermal and non-thermal techniques exploiting cavitation (hydrothermodynamic processing), microwave heating, electroporation (pulsed electric field processing), and high pressure have the potential to provide berry products with improved yields of phenolic compounds and less decomposition due to lower treatment temperatures and shorter exposure to heat during the treatment. These processes are viable alternatives during berry blanching and juice pasteurization, and also for extraction of phenolic fractions from the press residue. In the practical work of the thesis, the impact of various juice pressing technologies and storage conditions were studied on the chemical composition and sensory properties of black currant (Ribes nigrum L.) juices. During juice processing, berries were pressed with and without the application of supplementary enzymes. A two-phase juice extraction process yielded “Non-Enzymatic Berry”- and “Enzymatic Press Residue”-juices, which were compared with the conventional enzyme-assisted juice. The high phenolic content resulted in an increased astringency and bitterness in the enzymatically pressed juices. Native undisrupted pectins in the “Non-Enzymatic Berry”-juice reduced the astringency. The lowest content of phenolic compounds in the “Non-Enzymatic Berry-juice” led to the lowest stability of the phenolic composition during pasteurization and storage. The most notable decrease was observed in the monomeric anthocyanins, and the most significant increase inphenolic acids. Generally, the stability of anthocyanins is mostly influenced by the storage temperature, whereas other phenolic compounds are sensitive to both temperature and light. Light induced the conversion of (E) -p-coumaric acid derivatives into the corresponding (Z) -isomers. Flavonol glycosides were more stable, compared to anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. The chemical and sensory quality of the juices remained rather constant during cold (+ 4 °C) storage. Analyses were conducted by high-performance liquid chromatography – diode-array detection – electrospray ionization – mass spectrometry or tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–DAD–ESI–MS(–MS 2)), high-performance liquid chromatography – diode-array detection – electrospray ionization – quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC–DAD–ESI–Q-TOF-MS) and analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), after isolation with selective high-performance liquid chromatography. Analyses revealed derivatives of hydroxycinnamic acids: 2 -(Z) -p-coumaroyloxymethylene- 4 -β-D-glucopyranosyloxy- 2 -(Z) -butenenitrile, 2 -(E) -caffeoyloxymethylene- 4 -β-D-glucopyranosyloxy- 2 -(Z) -butenenitrile, (Z) -p-coumaric acid 4 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside and 1 -O-(Z) -p-coumaroyl-β-D-glucopyranose, and also free (Z) -p-coumaric acid. New product concepts for snacks were developed using the press residue obtained from different juice pressing processes. The research conducted for this thesis provided important knowledge on the stability of berry phenolics during various conditions of food processing and storage, and introduced sustainable process technologies for utilization of the berry and the side-stream. The results can promote the development of new berry products with enhanced quality...|$|R

The purpose of this work is {{to develop and implement}} a simple and robust preservation technology that can enhance food and economic security and thereby improve the lives of people in developing countries. The technique under development is termed “solar assisted pervaporation (SAP) ”. It is a sustainable technology whereby fruit juices or <b>purées</b> are <b>concentrated</b> using reusable pouches made of “breathable textiles”. The active layer of the textile is permeable to water vapour but not liquid water, and the process is related to the techniques pervaporation and membrane distillation. The pouches are filled with the juice/purée, hung from a tree or placed on a roof or in a solar dryer, and then exposed to sun and air for a specified period of time. A storage stable concentrate can be produced within 10 to 45 hours (depending on the conditions) and the entire concentration process is done using only solar energy. The fruit juice concentrate can be stored in the household or sold, thereby increasing both food and economic security in local communities. To demonstrate the feasibility of this technique, three different fruits/juices were concentrated by placing prototype pouches in a convective dryer to simulate a ventilated solar collector, or by exposing the pouches to a solar lamp equipped with convective air circulation to simulate ambient drying with direct sunlight exposure. Drying curves were obtained experimentally and the concentrates were analysed in terms of moisture content, water activity and degrees Brix. Depending on the drying time and type of fruit, the resulting product can be syrup-like, pasty, or have the texture of fruit leather. Under certain drying conditions, the water removal rate is actually higher for the pouch versus an open dish of the same dimensions because the pouch has two sides for mass transfer. Horizontal drying was found to be more effective than vertical drying and dissolved solids content was found to affect drying rate. Initial tests with a solar lamp have shown that drying rate increases with increasing radiant energy flux. It was also found that composition (fiber vs. sugar content) and form (purée vs. juice) of the fruit determines its compatibility with the pouch and drying technique.

The Pilot Scale Spray Dryer model ZLG- 10 used for drying process. Retention of nutrients in food during processing is nowadays an important matter for food processors. This is mainly {{due to the}} change of food consumption pattern, the current market demand and the regulatory requirement. The study investigates some of the important aspects involved in spray drying processing of guava, a tropical fruit which among all the fruits ranked second in terms of vitamin C content and, also, has a high amount of fiber. In this study, water activity and temperature effect on nutrient retention of guava juice in spray drying process investigated. The best temperature to spray dry which gives low deterioration of vitamin C is identified too. Vitamin C {{is known as the}} least stable one among all the nutrients, thus it is selected as an index for nutrient retention study. HPLC analyses were performed to determine vitamin C level in spray dried and initial guava puree. The research shows 170 oC is most fine and applicable temperature compare to any other temperature to give minimum vitamin C loss. Vitamin C deterioration depends both on temperature and water activity but experimentally proved water activity would play a more dominant role compared to temperature. Hence, a fast reduction of moisture content at higher temperature will help retaining vitamin C. First order reaction is used to describe the deterioration of vitamin C in spray drying process.
