40|$|Aims: 1. Explore {{the process}} of {{diagnosis}} and determine the factors responsible for diagnostic delay. 2. Explore {{the process of}} surveillance and determine the effectiveness of voluntary referral. 3. Determine {{the value of the}} current WHO diagnostic criteria. 4. Provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical and investigative phenotype of vCJD. ISO cases were identified in the UK between 1995 and 2005. The median age at onset was 26. The median duration of illness was 14 months although a single case remains alive after 70 months. There is a significant delay between onset and the first point of medical contact (mean of 3. 4 months) and a significant delay between onset and neurological review (mean of 7. 4 months). The clinical phenotype has remained relatively stereotyped with almost 70 % of patients present with psychiatric features and most neurological features developing after the first six months. Following this development, a relentless deterioration ensues with a median time to become bed-bound of only 13 months. Brain MRI remains the most important diagnostic aid in vCJD with over 90 % of patients providing <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> scan. <b>Tonsil</b> <b>biopsy</b> may provide support for the clinical diagnosis but should only be considered if genuine doubts remain following non-invasive investigations. In their current form the WHO diagnostic criteria are both sensitive and specific with a sensitivity of over 80 % and a specificity of 100 %. A voluntary system of case referral has been an overwhelming success in the UK with all suspected cases referred. The current WHO diagnostic criteria may be of value to both researcher and clinician alike. Despite voluntary referral, clinicians throughout the UK have been exceptionally supportive of the NCJDSU resulting in an effective surveillance programme.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to more fully characterize persistent PRRSV infections in swine. Twenty-eight 35 -day-old segregated-early-weaned pigs were inoculated intranasally with PRRSV. Serum and <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsy</b> samples were collected on days 0, 7, 14, 28, and then about monthly thereafter until day 251 post inoculation (PI). Virus was isolated from serum and <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsy</b> samples through days 28 and 56 PI, respectively. Viral RNA was detected in serum and <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsy</b> samples by RT-PCR through day 251 PI, although no positive serum samples were detected on days 84 - 196 PI. Greater proportions of day 28 and 56 PI serum samples and <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsies</b> were found to be PRRSV RNA positive by RT-PCR than positive by virus isolation. Although 20 of 28 <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsies</b> collected on day 84 PI were positive by RT-PCR, only one of 28 <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsies</b> collected one month later (day 119 PI) was positive. Three pigs returned to seronegative status on or after day 196 PI. Neither virus nor viral RNA was detected in these animals beyond day 119 PI. Conversely, five pigs that were persistently infected through day 225 or 251 PI remained seropositive throughout the study although one pig had an ELISA S/P ratio of 0. 41, nearly at the cutoff point of 0. 40. The results confirm RT-PCR is more sensitive than virus isolation in identifying PRRSV-infected pigs. The abrupt drop in the proportion of pigs with RT-PCR <b>positive</b> <b>tonsil</b> samples from day 84 to day 119 PI indicates most pigs clear the virus within three to four months, but some may remain persistently infected for several months...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{transmission}} trials with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae {{were carried}} out. The observed transmission was highly variable, which was surprising since {{the design of}} the trials was very similar. We investigated whether the variable transmission could be explained by variation in infectivity of A. pleuropneumoniae infected pigs. We looked for measurable characteristics, which could be indicative for infectious pigs or for the level of infectivity. The characteristic that appeared to be most indicative for a pig being infectious was <b>an</b> <b>A.</b> pleuropneumoniae <b>positive</b> <b>tonsil</b> at necropsy. The characteristic that was correlated to the level of infectivity was the number of A. pleuropneumoniae colonies isolated from the nasal swab, i. e. the probability for an infectious pig to infect a susceptible pig was tenfold higher on days where at least ten colonies were isolated. In this study it is shown {{that it is possible to}} measure the bacterial transmission of A. pleuropneumoniae under controlled circumstances if variation in infectivity is taken into accoun...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{dynamics}} of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) persistence in individual pigs {{is essential to the}} development of successful control programs. The objectives of this study were to investigate the proportion of inoculated pigs that become persistently infected with PRRSV and the duration of their infection. Additionally, different diagnostic techniques that detect persistent infections were compared. Twenty-eight 35 -day-old pigs were inoculated with PRRSV. Serum and <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsy</b> samples were collected on days 0, 7, 14, and 28 and then approximately monthly thereafter until day 251 post-inoculation (p. i.). Tonsil, lymph node, and lung samples were collected following euthanasia on day 251 p. i. Virus was isolated from serum and <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsy</b> samples that had been collected through days 28 and 56 p. i., respectively. Viral RNA was detected by reverse transcription (RT) -PCR in serum and <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsy</b> samples that had been collected through day 251 p. i., although no serum samples collected from days 84 to 196 p. i. were positive and the presence of infectious PRRSV was not detected by swine bioassay of tissue samples collected at necropsy. The results confirmed that RT-PCR is more sensitive than virus isolation in identifying PRRSV-infected pigs. Six pigs that were persistently infected through days 225 or 251 p. i. remained seropositive throughout the study, although one pig had an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay sample-to-positive ratio that was only slightly above the cutoff value of 0. 40. Twenty of 28 <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsy</b> samples collected on day 84 p. i. were positive by RT-PCR compared to only 1 positive biopsy sample out of 28 collected on day 119 p. i.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of relative size of the tonsil on academic performance in 4 (th) grade school children. In 320 children, physical examination to determine the size of tonsils was performed by the otorhinolaryngologist. A questionnaire was developed to assess sleep patterns and problems, and socio-demographic data for the student participants. Furthermore, their school performance was assessed using their grade in mathematics, science, reading, spelling, and handwriting. No association between tonsil size and academic performance was found. Snoring frequency, body mass index and body weight showed <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> relation with <b>tonsil</b> size. There was no association between tonsil size and sleepiness during the day, sleeping habits, hyperactivity, enuresis, history of tonsillectomy in children and parental cigarette smoking and education. In conclusion, this study did not show any significant relationship between tonsil size and academic performance in 4 th grade students.

40|$|Eight PCR {{tests were}} {{evaluated}} for {{their abilities to}} detect Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in swine tonsils. At first they were compared regarding their specificities by using A. pleuropneumoniae and related bacterial species and their analytical sensitivities by using tonsils experimentally infected in vitro. PCRs were carried out both directly with tonsil homogenates (direct PCR) and after culture of the sample (after-culture PCR). Most tests demonstrated good specificities; however, some tests gave false-positive results with some non-A. pleuropneumoniae species. High degrees of variation in the analytical sensitivities among the tests were observed for the direct PCRs (109 to 102 CFU/g of tonsil), whereas those {{of most of the}} after-culture PCRs were similar (102 CFU/g of tonsil). In a second phase, the effects of sample storage time and storage conditions were evaluated by using tonsils from experimentally infected animals. Storage at − 20 °C allowed the detection of the organism for at least 4 months. Finally, the omlA PCR test described by Savoye et al. (C. Savoye et al., Vet. Microbiol. 73 : 337 - 347, 2000) and the commercially available Adiavet App PCR test were further validated with field samples. Their effectiveness was compared to those of standard and immunomagnetic separation-based methods of bacterial isolation. In addition, a comparison of <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens (from living animals) and whole tonsils (collected at the slaughterhouse) was also conducted. A. pleuropneumoniae was neither isolated nor detected by PCR from a herd serologically negative for A. pleuropneumoniae. PCR was more sensitive than the standard isolation method with whole tonsils from three infected herds. After-culture PCR offered the highest degree of sensitivity (93 and 83 % for the omlA and Adiavet App PCRs, respectively). The PCR detection rate was higher with whole tonsils than with <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens.

In contrast, in SLE, 9 G 4 B cells progressed unimpeded through this checkpoint, successfully participated in GC reactions, and expanded within the post-GC IgG memory and plasma cell compartments. The faulty regulation of 9 G 4 B cells was not shared by RA patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tonsils are {{strategically}} {{located in}} the gateway of both alimentary and respiratory tracts representing the first contact point of food and aeroallergens with the immune system. Tonsillectomy removes only the palatine tonsils and sometimes adenoids. Lingual tonsil is anatomically big and remains lifelong intact. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate cellular and molecular mechanisms of oral tolerance induction to food and aeroallergens in human tonsils. METHODS: Tonsil allergen-specific FOXP 3 (+) regulatory T (Treg) cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and myeloid dendritic cells were characterized by flow cytometry and suppressive assays. Intracellular staining, [(3) H]-thymidine incorporation, and carboxy-fluorescein succinimidyl ester dilution experiments were performed. <b>Tonsil</b> <b>biopsies</b> were analyzed by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: CD 4 (+) FOXP 3 (+) Treg cells and pDCs constitute important T- and dendritic cell-compartments in palatine and lingual tonsils. Tonsil pDCs have the ability to generate functional CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) CD 127 (-) FOXP 3 (+) Treg cells with suppressive property from naive T cells. CD 4 (+) FOXP 3 (+) Treg cells proliferate and colocalize with pDCs in vivo in T-cell areas of lingual and palatine tonsils. Tonsil T cells did not proliferate to common food and aeroallergens. Depletion of FOXP 3 (+) Treg cells enables the allergen-induced proliferation of tonsil T cells, indicating an active role of Treg cells in allergen-specific T-cell unresponsiveness. High numbers of major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1 -specific CD 4 (+) FOXP 3 (+) Treg cells, are identified in human tonsils compared with peripheral blood. <b>A</b> <b>positive</b> correlation between the percentages of FOXP 3 (+) Treg cells and pDCs is observed in tonsils from nonatopic individuals.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Prion {{diseases}} are neurodegenerative disorders {{resulting from the}} accumulation of a misfolded isoform of the cellular prion protein (PrPc). They can occur as acquired, sporadic or hereditary forms. Although prion diseases show {{a wide range of}} phenotypic variations, pathological features and clinical evolution, they are all characterised by a common unfavourable course and a fatal outcome. REVIEW SUMMARY: Some variants, such as kuru, have practically disappeared, while others, for example the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob (vCJD) or those attributable to iatrogenic causes, are still in force and pose a challenge to current medicine. There are no definitive pre-mortem diagnostic tests, except for vCJD, where a <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsy</b> detects 100 % of the cases. For this reason, diagnostic criteria dependent on statistical probability have had to be created. These require complementary examinations, such as an electroencephalogram (EEG) or the detection of 14 - 3 - 3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Only the "pulvinar sign" in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been included as a vCJD diagnostic criterion. The present review discusses neuroimaging findings for each type of prion disease in patients with a definitive histopathological diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The aim is to define the usefulness of these complementary examinations as a tool for the diagnosis of this family of neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R

Aim: The aim {{of the present study}} is to compare the agreement rate of these tests in identifying H. pylori in tonsillar biopsy specimens collected from patients with chronic tonsillitis. Materials and Methods: A total of 103 <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsy</b> samples from patients with clinical signs of chronic tonsillitis were examined with RUT, PCR, and Scorpion real-time PCR. The degree of agreement between the three tests was later calculated.

Most {{of these patients}} (10 / 12) seroconverted 2 or 3 months after transplantation; 11 out of the 12 demonstrated clinical signs {{at the time of}} seroconversion. From 9 primoinfected patients tested for EBV excretion, 8 were found to be positive. Serological evidence of reactivation was found in 9 out 40 (22. 5 %) seropositive patients and EBV was isolated from 5 (56 %).

The decrease of tissue viral load was delayed compared to plasma viral load, possibly explained by the observation {{that the amount of}} follicular dendritic cell-associated virus correlated best with the area under the curve of plasma HIV- 1 RNA throughout the last 12 weeks. Before and during treatment, the relative proportions of HIV- 1 on follicular dendritic cells and within mononuclear cells remained constant, suggesting similar decay characteristics in these two lymphoid tissue compartments. However, viral p 24 or RNA remained almost always detectable in tissue despite full suppression of HIV- 1 RNA in plasma, and increased even after short-term rebounds in plasma viral load. Thus, full and sustained suppression of viral replication was required to efficiently decrease viral load in lymphoid tissue, but complete abolition of residual viral replication was not achieved...|$|R

The prionopathies [Kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and its variants, Gerstmann-Str&# 228;ussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome and fatal familial insomnia (FFI) ] result from accumulation of abnormal isoforms of the prion protein in the brains of normal animals on both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. The accumulation of this protein or fragments of it in neurons leads to apoptosis and cell death. There is a strong link between mutations in the gene encoding the normal prion protein in humans (PRNP) - located on the short arm of chromosome 20 &# 8211; and forms of prion disease with a familial predisposition (familial CJD, GSS, FFI). Clinically a prionopathy should be suspected in any case of a fast progressing dementia with ataxia, myoclonus, or in individuals with pathological insomnia associated with dysautonomia. Magnetic resonance imaging, identification of the 14 - 3 - 3 protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsy</b> and genetic studies have been used for in vivo diagnosis circumventing the need of brain biopsy. Histopathology, however, remains the only conclusive method to reach a confident diagnosis. Unfortunately, despite numerous treatment efforts, prionopathies remain short-lasting and fatal diseases...|$|R
40|$|Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal {{transmissible}} {{spongiform encephalopathy}} affecting white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), and moose (Alces alces shirasi) in North America. In southeastern Wyoming average annual CWD prevalence in mule deer exceeds 20 % and appears to contribute to regional population declines. We determined the effect of CWD on mule deer demography using age-specific, female-only, CWD transition matrix models to estimate the population growth rate (λ). Mule deer were captured from 2010 - 2014 in southern Converse County Wyoming, USA. Captured adult (≥ 1. 5 years old) deer were tested ante-mortem for CWD using <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsies</b> and monitored using radio telemetry. Mean annual survival rates of CWD-negative and CWD-positive deer were 0. 76 and 0. 32, respectively. Pregnancy and fawn recruitment were not observed {{to be influenced by}} CWD. We estimated λ = 0. 79, indicating an annual population decline of 21 % under current CWD prevalence levels. A model derived from the demography of only CWD-negative individuals yielded; λ = 1. 00, indicating a stable population if CWD were absent. These findings support CWD as a significant contributor to mule deer population decline. Chronic wasting disease is difficult or impossible to eradicate with current tools, given significant environmental contamination, and at present our best recommendation for control of this disease is to minimize spread to new areas and naïve cervid populations...|$|R
40|$|Skeletal muscle neoplasms, in {{contrast}} to other groups of tumors, are almost malignant. The benign variant, rhabdomyoma, is distinctly rare. Rhabdomyomas can be classified generally into two types: cardiac and extracardiac. Extracardiac rhabdomyoma can be further divided into three subtypes: adult, fetal, and genital type. Adult rhabdomyoma {{is the most common}} subtype of rhabdomyoma even though it remains relatively rare. Fetal rhabdomyomas are less common than the adult type. In this paper we report a rare case of a fetal rhabdomyoma with polyp-like appearance originating from right <b>tonsil.</b> Punch <b>biopsy</b> and then right tonsillectomy were performed for complete excision. There was no obvious recurrence...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to {{evaluate}} the existence of a link between biofilm assembly on pharyngeal tonsil and the incidence of recurrent infections within a paediatric population. Methods: Nasal and pharyngeal tonsils scrubs as well as a <b>biopsies</b> of pharyngeal <b>tonsils</b> tissue were collected (n= 70) and processed for bacterial identification using standard microbiologic methods. Bacteria were identified at the species level using a VITEC apparatus. Another pharyngeal <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsies</b> were processed for electron microscopy. Initially, a screening for the presence of biofilms was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) being the positive samples further processed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Biofilm assembly assay ability in vitro was evaluated by the microtiter-plate test. The assay was performed at 37 ºC in Muller-Hinton broth for different periods of time. Results: As expected a vast number of bacterial species were identified in the samples. The majority were aerobic and a balance between Gram negative and positive bacteria was observed. A good correlation between the floras of the three samples from the same patient was found. The presence of biofilms pharyngeal tonsils was assessed by SEM. The data collected so far suggest that in at least 30 % of the samples biofilms were present. In vitro all the microorganisms evaluated were able to assemble biofilms. Conclusion: Biofilm formation can be part of the mechanism involved both in onset and propagation of infections. Further studies must be performed to validate the thesis that pharyngeal tonsils function as a reservoir for microorganisms...|$|R
40|$|In September 2002, {{chronic wasting disease}} (CWD), a prion {{disorder}} of captive and wild cervids, was diagnosed in a white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from a captive farm in Wisconsin. The facility was subsequently quarantined, and in January 2006 the remaining 76 deer were depopulated. Sixty animals (79 %) {{were found to be}} positive by immunohistochemical staining for the abnormal prion protein (PrPCWD) in at least one tissue; the prevalence of positive staining was high even in young deer. Although none of the deer displayed clinical signs suggestive of CWD at depopulation, 49 deer had considerable accumulation of the abnormal prion in the medulla {{at the level of the}} obex. Extraneural accumulation of the abnormal protein was observed in 59 deer, with accumulation in the retropharyngeal lymph node in 58 of 59 (98 %), in the tonsil in 56 of 59 (95 %), and in the rectal mucosal lymphoid tissue in 48 of 58 (83 %). The retina was positive in 4 deer, all with marked accumulation of prion in the obex. One deer was considered positive for PrPCWD in the brain but not in the extraneural tissue, a novel observation in white-tailed deer. The infection rate in captive deer was 20 - fold higher than in wild deer. Although weakly related to infection rates in extraneural tissues, prion genotype was strongly linked to progression of prion accumulation in the obex. Antemortem testing by biopsy of recto– anal mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (or other peripheral lymphoid tissue) may be a useful adjunct to <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsy</b> for surveillance in captive herds at risk for CWD infection...|$|R
40|$|Kuru {{is so far}} the {{principal}} human epidemic prion disease. While its incidence has steadily declined since the cessation of its route of transmission, endocannibalism, in Papua New Guinea in the 1950 s, the arrival of variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD), also thought to be transmitted by dietary prion exposure, has given kuru a new global relevance. We investigated all suspected cases of kuru from July 1996 to June 2004 and identified 11 kuru patients. There were four females and seven males, with an age range of 46 – 63 years {{at the onset of}} disease, in marked contrast to the age and sex distribution when kuru was first investigated 50 years ago. We obtained detailed histories of residence and exposure to mortuary feasts and performed serial neurological examination and genetic studies where possible. All patients were born a significant period before the mortuary practice of transumption ceased and their estimated incubation periods in some cases exceeded 50 years. The principal clinical features of kuru in the studied patients showed the same progressive cerebellar syndrome that had been previously described. Two patients showed marked cognitive impairment well before preterminal stages, in contrast to earlier clinical descriptions. In these patients, the mean clinical duration of 17 months was longer than the overall average in kuru but similar to that previously reported for the same age group, and this may relate to the effects of both patient age and PRNP codon 129 genotype. Importantly, no evidence for lymphoreticular colonization with prions, seen uniformly in vCJD, was observed in a patient with kuru at <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsy...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of tonsil cancers {{has increased in}} several countries. French data on HPV prevalence in tonsil cancers are scarce. The objective {{of this study was}} thus to assess the overall and type specific HPV prevalence in tonsil histological samples. Methods: This French retrospective multicenter study involved 12 centres located throughout the country. Were included 185 histological samples collected from year 2000 to 2009 with a validated diagnosis of tonsil invasive carcinomas. HPV prevalence was studied according to gender, age and histological type of cancer. Results: Overall HPV prevalence was 57 % in tonsil cancers. Mean age of diagnosis was comparable in HPV <b>positive</b> <b>tonsils</b> cases (60 ± 11. 2) and HPV negative tonsil cases (59 ± 9. 6). HPV prevalence was significantly higher in female than in male cases (28 / 35 versus 78 / 150 in tonsil cases, respectively, P = 0. 003). About 53 % of tonsil cases were infected by a single HPV type. Only eight (4 %) samples were infected by more than one HPV type. Among HPV positive samples, HPV 16 was found in 89 % of tonsil cases. All other HPV types had prevalence below 5 %. Conclusions: Our results indicate that HPV is common in tonsil carcinomas and emphasize the predominant role of HPV 16. Backgroun...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the impact of the tongue handling practice on the contamination of the pork carcasses: the tongue removed with the pluck set (3 slaughterhouses) vs the intact tongue inside the head (3 slaughterhouses). A total of 1920 pigs from 120 different farms were sampled both on their tonsils and carcass surfaces over a one year period. The individual prevalence of Y. enterocolitica on tonsils and carcasses was unexpectedly low and estimated respectively to be 5. 7 % [4. 7 - 6. 9] and 0. 6 % [0. 3 - 1. 0] from the pooled samples. The presence of Y. enterocolitica on the carcasses was statistically linked to its presence on tonsils. It was nearly five times higher on pigs with <b>positive</b> <b>tonsils,</b> than on pigs with negative tonsils. Despite the experimental design, we were not able to confirm that the removal of the tongue on the slaughter line had a significant impact on the carcass contamination with Yersinia enterocolitica. These results confirm that cross contaminations occur during the slaughtering process and that good hygiene practices are necessary to limit the transfer of Y. enterocolitca from the tonsils, or the feces, to the carcasses...|$|R
40|$|The {{examination}} of rectoanal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (RAMALT) biopsy specimens for {{the diagnosis of}} transmissible spongiform encephalopathies has been described in sheep, elk, and small numbers of mule and white-tailed deer. Previous sample numbers have been too small to validate {{examination of}} this type of tissue as a viable antemortem diagnostic test. In this study, we examined RAMALT collected postmortem from 76 white-tailed deer removed from a farm in Wisconsin known to be affected by chronic wasting disease (CWD) and from 210 free-ranging white-tailed deer harvested from an area in Wisconsin where the overall prevalence of CWD among the deer was approximately 4 to 6 %. The results of immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of the RAMALT sections were compared to the results of IHC staining of sections from the brain stem at the convergence of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, sections of the medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes (RLNs), and sections of tonsil (sections of tonsil only from captive animals were tested). The sensitivities of the IHC staining test with RAMALT sections were 81 % for the captive animals and 91 % for the free-ranging animals. False-negative results were usually associated with early infection, indicated by a low intensity of immunostaining in the obex and/or a polymorphism at PRNP codon 96. While the RLN remains the tissue of choice for use for the diagnosis of CWD in white-tailed deer, {{the results of the present}} study further support the use of RAMALTs collected antemortem as an adjunct to testing of <b>tonsil</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens and surveillance by necropsy for the screening of farmed deer which have been put at risk through environmental exposure or exposure to deer with CWD...|$|R
40|$|Isolation of {{specific}} serotypes of Streptococcus suis from the tonsils, nasal cavities, and genital tract is difficult, since low-pathogenic serotypes and untypeable strains also inhabit these sites. An immunomagnetic separation (IMS) technique for the selective isolation of S. suis serotypes 2 and 1 / 2 was standardized. Superparamagnetic polystyrene beads (immunomagnetic beads or IMB) were coated {{with either a}} purified monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed to a capsular sialic acid-containing epitope or purified rabbit immunoglobulin G (polyclonal antibody [PAb]), both specific for S. suis serotypes 2 and 1 / 2. The amount of antibodies required for optimum coating of the beads, the number of IMB required for optimum bacterial recovery, and the nonspecific carryover were considerably higher with the MAb-IMS technique than with the PAb-IMS technique. The sensitivity of the IMS technique was 101 CFU/ 0. 1 g of tonsil. The presence of serotype 1 / 2 bacteria did not considerably affect the recovery rate of a serotype 2 strain and vice versa. To validate the technique, PAb-coated beads were used to study 192 tonsils from animals from S. suis serotype 2 - or 1 / 2 -infected herds. Results showed that significantly more <b>positive</b> <b>tonsils</b> were detected by the IMS technique than by the standard procedure. This method represents an innovative and highly sensitive approach for the isolation of S. suis serotypes 2 and 1 / 2 from carrier animals...|$|R
