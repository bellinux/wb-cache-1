5|$|Rotavirus B, {{also called}} adult {{diarrhoea}} rotavirus or ADRV, has caused major epidemics of severe diarrhoea affecting {{thousands of people}} of all ages in China. These epidemics occurred as a result of sewage contamination of drinking water. Rotavirus B infections also occurred in India in 1998; the causative strain was named CAL. Unlike ADRV, the CAL strain is endemic. To date, epidemics caused by rotavirus B have been confined to mainland China, <b>and</b> <b>surveys</b> indicate a lack of immunity to this species in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Between 1908 and 1922, Spruce Tree House, Cliff Palace, and Sun Temple ruins were stabilised. Most of {{the early}} efforts were led by Jesse Walter Fewkes. During the 1930s and 40s, Civilian Conservation Corps workers, {{starting}} in 1932, played key roles in excavation efforts, building trails and roads, creating museum exhibits and constructing buildings at Mesa Verde. From 1958 to 1965, Wetherill Mesa Archaeological Project included archaeological excavations, stabilization of sites, <b>and</b> <b>surveys.</b> With excavation and study of eleven Wetherill Mesa sites, it is considered the largest archaeological effort in the US. The project oversaw the excavation of Long House and Mug House.|$|E
5|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is high {{altitude}} subtropical or tropical dry forests composed primarily of African juniper. However, the juniper forests preferred by the francolin are dying, {{so it may}} be found in other habitats, such as box-tree forests. This bird is only known from two locations in Djibouti, one of which is largely unsurveyed. It can be found in small groups and is extremely shy. It is known to feed on berries, seeds, and termites, and it breeds between December and February. It is considered a critically endangered species because it underwent a 90% population decline in twenty years. The degrading of its juniper habitat through man-made disturbances, such as overgrazing, is a major threat to the francolin's survival. Ongoing conservation work includes the restoration of some juniper forest, <b>and</b> <b>surveys</b> to obtain accurate population counts and to raise awareness.|$|E

5|$|Official {{interest}} in Hurst Castle increased {{again in the}} 1840s, as the introduction of shell guns and steam ships created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast. Previously, sailing ships had been only able to pass the castle slowly when moving against the tide, making them vulnerable to its guns; steam ships threatened to cruise past at speed. Military estimates <b>and</b> <b>surveys</b> in 1850 and 1851 suggested that the armament should therefore be significantly increased, to include more and much heavier guns.|$|E
5|$|Three early {{registers}} of {{the dean}} and chapter of Wells– the Liber Albus I (White Book; R I), Liber Albus II (R III) and Liber Ruber (Red Book; R II, section i)– were edited by W. H. B. Bird for the Historical Manuscripts Commissioners {{and published in}} 1907. The books comprise, with some repetition, a cartulary of possessions of the cathedral, with grants of land dating back {{as early as the}} 8th century, well before the development of hereditary surnames in England; they also comprise acts of the Dean and Chapter, <b>and</b> <b>surveys</b> of their estates, mostly in Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} effects of raising {{children}} and having a career simultaneously are mostly seen in women throughout many societies, the men in such situations are affected greatly as well. This is not seen in all situations in males because the effects on men differ greatly from how females are affected by this extra responsibility. In The Canadian Family in Crisis, the author suggests a reason for these effects to go unnoticed in most studies <b>and</b> <b>surveys.</b> This is because women's stress can be seen through direct labor consisting of housework and career whereas men's stress, in most cases, mostly come from decision making and work-family conflicts. These situations arise where the male must make {{the best choice for}} the future of his family. Specifically, these include things such as workload, overtime hours, shift decisions, and even accepting a promotion or a transfer. In these situations, the man is forced to make major choices that will affect the entire family, which brings on more stress. The effects also go unnoticed since, in traditional gender roles, the male {{is supposed to be the}} backbone of the family and, in the past, it would have been seen as weakness for the male to display his emotions to the rest of the family. In surveys and studies done, most males would not like to be seen as too weak to handle his responsibilities as the role of the adult male in the household, which in the past has consisted of being the major economical supporter and physical figure for the family. With this in mind, it is very possible that some may have lied when surveyed about these topics.|$|E
