5|$|The CAB {{carried out}} flight tests using a DC-6. They {{found that if}} the {{propellers}} were reversed prior to take-off they would not, if the flag was not raised, be rotated automatically again {{in the air to}} produce forward thrust if full power was <b>applied.</b> Tests performed by United Airlines showed that, if the propellers of just one engine were reversed and full power was <b>applied</b> to all four engines, then the aircraft would spiral into a dive. If METO (maximum except take-off) power was <b>applied</b> to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines, and full reverse thrust was <b>applied</b> to engine No. 4, then the aircraft would become uncontrollable.|$|E

5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a force is <b>applied</b> {{in the direction}} of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the <b>applied</b> force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the <b>applied</b> force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the factors affecting the application of innovations for dairy farmers in the Milas district, Muğla province, Turkey. Data from 71 dairy farmers and the Multinominal logit model are used for this study. The dependent variable of the model is divided into three categories; “I don’t <b>apply</b> any agricultural innovations”, “I <b>apply</b> agricultural innovations only after other farmers <b>apply</b> and express their positive opinion” and “I <b>apply</b> agricultural innovations”. In conclusion of the analysis, the comparisons are done with the farmers who “do not <b>apply</b> any agricultural innovations,” and the farmers who “apply agricultural innovations only after other farmers <b>apply</b> and express their positive opinion”; it is determined that a one unit increase in educational level raised the likelihood of <b>applying</b> innovations after receiving positive opinion. When the farmers that “apply agricultural innovation”, and that “apply agricultural innovations only after other farmers <b>apply</b> and express their positive opinion” are compared, it is found that a one unit increase in the number of milking animals had increased the likelihood of <b>applying</b> the innovations...|$|R
