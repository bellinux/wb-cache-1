An alternative of solution can be the use of passive mechanisms of noise reductions, nonetheless its application cannot diminish low-frequency noise.

40|$|Fluid-borne {{noise is}} one of the main {{components}} of hydraulic noise. Its attenuation may have a significant effect on the cost of hydraulic systems. Standard passive silencers and dampers can be useful in reducing it in certain frequency ranges; however, these tend to be heavy, bulky and expensive. Active control algorithms, which are a comparatively recent means of reducing fluid-borne noise, can be applied to overcome this compromise. The work presented in this thesis is the development of some active control algorithms utilized in a simple hydraulic system to cancel a number of harmonic orders of fluid-borne noise generated by a servo valve or a real pump. To realize cancellation the filtered reference least mean square (FXLMS) adaptive control method is mainly presented. Furthermore, a fast response servo valve is applied as an actuator to generate a proper <b>anti-noise</b> flow <b>signal</b> in real-time. For simplicity, an off-line identification method for the secondary path is applied in the time invariant working condition. Moreover, ripple reflection from both ends of the hydraulic circuit can produce different effects under different working conditions. In order to execute the cancellation without any prior information about the dynamics of hydraulic systems, the on-line secondary path identification method is discussed. However, in this algorithm an auxiliary white-noise signal applied to an on-line method may contribute to residual noise and an extra computation burden may be added to the whole control system. The performance of these control algorithms is firstly investigated via simulation in a hydraulic pipe model and the real-time application on a test rig using a servo valve as a noise source. Finally, these schemes are realized in a simple hydraulic system with a real pump noise source. The fluid-borne noise can be attenuated by about 20 dB in normal working conditions.

40|$|In {{broadband}} Active Noise Control Systems it {{is often}} desirable to limit the <b>anti-noise</b> <b>signal</b> frequency {{in order to prevent}} the increase of the noise level at higher frequen-cies, in regions somewhat away form the error sensor. This is in fact an alternative to the use of several error sensors per anti-noise source. This paper proposes modica-tions to the traditional algorithms to achieve this goal, and studies how this modica-tions alter the working of the system. Simply using a lter at the reference signal or at the input of the cancelling loudspeaker, (this could be the anti-aliasing or reconstruc-tion lters) isn't enough since the ANC controller will try to invert this lers. The use of sharp lters and a leakage factor can reduce this problem but at the expense of increasing the delay of the system. The techniques proposed allow the calculation of the primary path and secondary path delay required for a successful implementation of a broadband ANC system. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Active Noise Control (ANC) {{involves}} an electro acoustic or electromechanical system that cancels the primary (unwanted) noise {{based on the}} principle of superposition. An <b>anti-noise</b> <b>signal</b> of equal amplitude and opposite phase is generated and combined with the primary noise, resulting in the cancellation of the noise. A fundamental problem to be considered in ANC systems is the requirement of highly precise control, temporal stability and reliability. To produce high degree of attenuation, the amplitude and phase of both the primary and the secondary noise must match with the close precision. The adaptive filters are used to control the noise and it has a linear input and output characteristic. If a transfer path of the noise has nonlinear characteristics it will be difficult for the filter to generate an optimal anti-noise. In this study, we propose a algorithm, delta rule algorithm which uses non linear output function. Delta rule is used for learning complex patterns in Artificial Neural Networks. We have implemented the adaptive filters using Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm, Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm and compared the results...|$|E
40|$|Active {{noise control}} (ANC) {{is a more}} {{effective}} technique used for acoustic noise cancelation in comparison with passive approaches which are difficult and expensive to implement, especially for cancelling the noise in the low frequency range. In the ANC system, an <b>anti-noise</b> <b>signal</b> is introduced to suppress the primary noise to produce a residual which is used for updating the adaptive filter coefficients. In this paper, a method of transient content enhancement for fault detection and diagnosis is investigated based on a laboratory ANC system. A number of simulation studies are conducted to evaluate {{the performance of the}} method using a typical filtered-x least mean square (FXLMS) algorithm under different types of noise signals. In the mean time, the algorithm is also adapted to achieve feature extraction under the condition of maintaining its noise cancelation performance. Moreover, experimental studies were carried out using noise signals from a heavy duty diesel engine to further demonstrate the performance obtained from simulation studies. The simulation and preliminary experimental results show that the investigated ANC algorithm can obtain an effective noise cancellation for sinusoidal signal in low frequency band and provide a residual signal with more non-stationary contents for developing diagnostic features...|$|E
40|$|Conventional (passive) {{headsets}} used in propeller aircrafts {{are reasonably}} good at attenuating mid to high frequency noise, but fail to achieve good attenuation {{in the low}} frequency region (below approximately 300 Hz). Active Noise Reduction (ANR) improves the low frequency attenuation by introducing an <b>anti-noise</b> <b>signal</b> creating destructive interference thus decreasing the residual noise level. The aim of this thesis is {{to develop and implement}} a digital narrowband active noise reduction headset that works properly in aircrafts and not only in a laboratory environment. The implementation is based on a narrowband ltered-X least mean squares (FXLMS) algorithm where the tonal components in the noise spectrum are synthesized for use as reference signals to the algorithm. The controller is implemented in a parallel fashion where each tonal component is handled separately. The system is built into a headset and laboratory tests show that the algorithm can handle ve simultaneous tonal components with an adaptation time of less than one second. Aircraft tests show peak attenuation of 17 dB in both singleand twin-engine aircrafts thus fullling the requirements. Simulations and true performance show some minor discrepancies which are explained and discussed...|$|E

Two different adaptive methods using filtered reference least mean square (FXLMS) notch filter with online identification algorithm in time-domain were used.

It was found that FBN reflections from both ends of hydraulic circuit can change the dynamic response of the actuator. In addition to the experiments, Simulation work of active control of fluid borne noise in the simple hydraulic system was performed.

40|$|Achieving a {{low noise}} level is of great {{interest}} to the forest machine industry. Traditionally this is obtained by using passive noise reduction, i. e. by using materials for sound isolation and sound absorption. Especially designs to attenuate low frequency noise tend to be bulky and impractical from an installation point of view. An alternative solution to the problem is to use active noise control (ANC). The basic principle of ANC is to generate an <b>anti-noise</b> <b>signal</b> designed to destructively interfere with the unwanted noise. In this thesis two algorithms (Feedback FxLMS and Feedforward FxLMS) are implemented and evaluated for use in the ANC-system. The ANC-system is tuned to the speciﬁc environment in the driver’s cabin of a Komatsu forest machine. The algorithms are ﬁrst tested in a simulated environment and then in real-time inside a forest machine. Simulations are made both in Matlab and in C using both generated signals and recorded signals. The C code is implemented on the Analog Devices Blackﬁn DSP card BF 526. The result showed a signiﬁcantly reduction of the sound pressure level (SPL) in the driver’s cabin. The noise attenuation obtained using the Feedback FxLMS was approximately 14 dB for a tonal 100 Hz signal and 11 dB using recorded engine noise from a forest machine at 850 rpm...|$|E
40|$|The idea of {{cancelling}} {{the acoustic}} noise by generating an <b>anti-noise</b> <b>signal</b> is very fascinating, and was first proposed by P. Lueg in 1936. In feedforward {{active noise control}} (ANC) systems, the <b>anti-noise</b> <b>signal</b> is generated {{with the help of}} reference and error microphones, an adaptive filtered-x-LMS (FxLMS) algorithm based ANC filter, and an electro-acoustic path named as the secondary path. For stable operation of ANC systems, the FxLMS algorithm needs an estimate of the secondary path. The <b>anti-noise</b> <b>signal</b> generated by the loudspeaker (part of secondary path) causes interference with the reference microphone signal. This interference is due to the presence of electro-acoustic path, named as feedback path, between the loudspeaker and the reference microphone. It is required to neutralize the effect of this feedback path, and hence an estimate of the feedback path is required. For online modeling of the secondary and feedback paths, an additional auxiliary noise is injected. This auxiliary noise contributes to the residual error, and thus degrades the noise-reduction-performance (NRP) of ANC system. In order to improve the NRP, a gain scheduling strategy is used to vary the variance of the injected auxiliary noise. The purpose of the gain scheduling is that when the model estimates of the secondary and the feedback paths are far from the actual unknown paths, auxiliary noise with large variance is injected. Once the model estimates are closer to the actual unknown paths, the variance of auxiliary noise is reduced to a small value. In this way, on one hand the gain scheduling can help us to achieve the required model estimates of secondary and feedback paths, {{and on the other hand}} to improve the NRP at the steady-state. In this thesis, we discuss the two most important issues, i. e., 1) online secondary path modeling (OSPM), and 2) online feedback path modeling and neutralization (FBPMN) with gain scheduling. In chapter 1, the basic underlying physical principle and configurations of active noise control (ANC) systems are explained. The application of the basic building block of an ANC system i. e. An adaptive filter, in different system identification scenarios is discussed. The most popular adaptive algorithm for ANC system, i. e., FxLMS algorithm is derived for the general secondary path. A brief overview is given for the two fundamental issues in ANC systems, i. e., 1) OSPM and 2) online FBPMN. The use of optimal excitation signal, i. e., Perfect sweep signals for system identification is described. In chapter 2, the existing methods for OSPM without gain scheduling, where the auxiliary noise with fixed variance is used in all operating conditions, are discussed. In this chapter a simplified structure for OSPM with the modified FxLMS (MFxLMS) adaptive algorithm is proposed. The advantage of the simplified structure is that it reduces the computational complexity of the MFxLMS algorithm based OSPM without having any compromise on the performance of ANC system. In chapter 3, the existing methods for OSPM with gain scheduling are discussed. The drawbacks with the existing gain scheduling strategies are highlighted, and some new gain scheduling strategies are proposed to improve the modeling accuracy of SPM filter and the NRP of an ANC system. In existing methods, the gain is varied based on the power of residual error signal which carries information only about the convergence status of ANC system. In the Proposed methods the gain is varied based on the power of error signal of SPM filter. This is more desirable way of controlling the gain because the power of error signal of SPM filter carries information about the convergence status of both the ANC system and the SPM filter. The performance comparison is carried out through the simulation results. In chapter 4, the second most important issue associated with the feedforward configuration of ANC system, i. e., the issue of online FBPMN is deal with. In the first part, the existing methods for online FBPMN without gain scheduling are discussed. A new structure is proposed for online FBPMN without gain scheduling. The performance of the existing methods is compare with the proposed method through the simulation results. In the new structure the good features from the existing structures are combined together. The predictor is used in the new structure to remove the predictable interference term from the error signal of adaptive FBPMN filter. In addition to this, the action of FBPM filter and the FBPN filter is combined into a single FBPMN filter. The advantage of the new structure over the existing structures is that it can better neutralize the effect of feedback coupling on the input signal of ANC filter, thus improves the convergence of ANC system. In the second part, a gain scheduling strategy is proposed to improve the NRP of ANC system. In addition to this, a self-tuned ANP scheduling strategy with matching step-size for FBPMN filter is also proposed that requires no tuning parameters and further improves the NRP of ANC systems. In chapter 5, the concluding remarks and some future research directions are given. 電気通信大学 201...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{subject of}} this thesis is {{the design of a}} system which can drive piezo-panels. This system is called the piezo driver. The piezo-panels are used for an Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) system which is being {{developed}} to be used inside the cabin of airplanes. The piezo driver fills the gap between the calculating system, which provides the <b>anti-noise</b> <b>signal,</b> and the piezo-panel. The total ANC system is designed as one complete system. The piezo driver has to be placed on the panel and therefore the piezo driver is integrated on chip. Further the undesired electric behaviour of the piezo-panel is not allowed to affect the output signal. The piezo driver is designed to drive piezo elements in the specified range of 50 nF to 500 nF. Piezoelectric material shows hysteresis between the applied voltage and the displacement of the material. Besides this, the material also shows resonance behaviour. For low frequencies the piezoelectric material behaves like a capacitor. The material requires high driving volt-ages. Studies show that the hysteresis can be solved by applying charge control. The resonance be-haviour can be predicted {{with the use of a}} model. This model uses the mechanical and electric properties of the piezo-panel to do so. The electric impedance of the piezo element can also be simulated with the help of the model. The main function of the piezo driver is to amplify the input signal. Because of the high driv-ing voltages, dissipation is an issue. Research of several amplifier stages shows that a class-D topology will give the lowest dissipation. The class-D design is adjusted to the electric behaviour of the piezo-panel. The modulator, output filter and feedback of the amplifier design are adjusted for this purpose. The piezo driver has an analog input and output signal and therefore a PWM modulator is chosen. The reference signal for the PWM modulator is a triangle waveform because this type of waveform will give the best results concerning EMI. Research of the piezo element shows that for high frequencies the resonance behaviour is very small and can be neglected. The frequency of the triangle waveform is therefore chosen at 1 MHz to have little influence of the piezoelectric resonance. The output filter used in a class-D design is a LC low pass filter. The capacitive behaviour of the piezo element makes it possible to incorporate the piezo-panel into the filter. The choice of the inductor introduces a problem. The size of the coil is limited because of the maximum thickness of the panel. The maximum available inductor which fits on the panel is used in the filter. The bandwidth is increased by this but does not give any real problems. Feedback is applied in the piezo driver to improve the quality of the output signal, it reduces noise and distortion. A charge control circuit is implemented into the feedback to control the charge inside the piezo-patch. This reduces the hysteresis effect of the piezo element. The gain in the feedback loop is increased by a loop amplifier. Higher loop gain decreases the ef-fect of noise and distortion on the output signal. 3 The total functional design is tested and shows good results. The hysteresis and resonance behaviour of the piezo element has little influence on the functionality and output signal of the piezo driver. The piezo driver design is translated to a circuit design which can be integrated on chip. All the main functions are designed. These are; input buffer, subtractor, PWM modulator and gate driver. The sub-functions are simulated and show good results. The final piezo driver design is simulated and tested to check the design. Because of the dura-tion of the simulations not all tests have been done with the complete piezo driver design. Simulation of the piezo driver with a non-linear piezo circuit model shows that the charge control works correctly. The requirements are almost all satisfied. The minimum value in the piezo element range forms a problem for the stability of the piezo driver. To ensure stability for this situation some alterations have to be made. A total circuit design of the piezo driver has been made and simulated. The tests indicate that except for one point all requirements have been satisfied...|$|E
