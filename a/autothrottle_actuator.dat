On 21 July 2013, BEA noted that there was intermittent failures on the autothrottle {{that led to the}} replacement of the EPR transmitter on No.2 engine. On 19 October 2013, the No.1 engine EPR indicator was faulty (no display of values) and the display was replaced. On 2 March 2014, the <b>autothrottle</b> <b>actuator</b> was replaced. During the recommissioning process, the [...] "EPR LH" [...] failure message was displayed. The left-hand EPR transmitter was therefore also replaced.
