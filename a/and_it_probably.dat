5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Middle Kingdom period, in the early 12th Dynasty (19911802 BC), pharaoh Senusret I (19711926 BC) commissioned a statue of Sahure. The statue was located in the temple of Karnak <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> belonged to a group of portraits of deceased kings.|$|E
5|$|Pingré also {{reported}} that the island was becoming deforested by tortoise hunters who set fires to clear vegetation. Along with direct hunting of the parrots, this likely led {{to a reduction in}} the population of Rodrigues parrots. Pingré's 1761 account is the last known mention of the species, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> became extinct soon after.|$|E

5|$|Freyja {{receives}} the slain {{heroes of the}} battlefield quite respectfully as Óðinn does. Her house is called Sessrumnir, 'filled with many seats', <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> fills the same function as Valhöll, 'the hall of the slain', where the warriors eat and drink beer after the fighting. Still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse View of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn {{and the other to}} Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.|$|E
5|$|The {{execution}} of a royal prince was a great provocation to the seventeen-year-old Edward III, {{who had not been}} informed about the decision, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> contributed to the king's decision to rise up against his protector. In 1330, Edward III carried out a coup installing himself in personal control of government, and Mortimer was executed. Among the charges against Mortimer was that of procuring Edmund's death, and the charges against the late earl of Kent were annulled. In late 1325, Edmund had married Margaret Wake, sister of Thomas Wake, Baron Wake of Liddell, and the couple had several children. His lands and titles descended on his oldest son by the same name, but this Edmund himself died in October 1331. The earldom then passed to the younger son John.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{powerful}} kings was the Swedish king who according to early sources only ruled what is today eastern Svealand. It is unknown when it happened <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> happened several times, but when sources become more reliable the territories of the Swedish kings include Västergötland and other parts of Götaland. This stage is by some considered to be the beginning of Sweden, as we know it today.|$|E

If one of the components is missing, this protein complex cannot fulfill its function in the living cell, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> comes to the degeneration the same. The function of this protein complex has been suggested to participate in the signal transduction or in the cell adhesion of sensory cells.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire has a rich {{heritage}} of folk music and folk dance including particularly Long Sword dance. Folk songs {{were collected in}} the region from the 19thcentury, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> had more attention than other northern counties, but its rich {{heritage of}} northern and industrial folk song was relatively neglected. It {{was not until the}} second folk revival in the 1950s that Nigel and Mary Hudleston began to attempt to redress the balance, collecting a large number of Yorkshire songs between 1958 and 1978.|$|E
25|$|In the {{narrative}} Iranian history, Ardashir {{is described as}} a heroic, bold, forethoughtful man with a high amount of fortitude and mood. According to those texts, he was a persistent man and had a chivalric behavior though he applied much violence and cruelty, and fought alongside his warriors in battles. In {{the narrative}} Iranian history texts, Ardashir succeeded because he was from the line of the ancient Iranian shahanshahs and was chosen by the gods to rule Iran. But {{there is no doubt in}} that justifying the Sasanian rule occurred by adding some matters to the real trend of the events of the era later and at the end of their reign <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> had a political reason to mention those matters in official writings.|$|E
5000|$|Rickman's {{performance}} was well received by critics, with Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times saying, [...] "Mr Rickman was never {{nominated for an}} Academy Award <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>probably</b> a long shot for a posthumous Supporting Actor for this film - but his work here {{is a reminder of}} what a special talent he possessed." ...|$|R

25|$|Much of the {{development}} of the style occurred in Italy, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> spread north of the Alps to influence France partly through the colony of Italian artists attached to the Papal Court at Avignon, and the works displayed from the residence there in the 1330s and 1340s of Simone Martini, a Sienese precursor of the style. Republican Siena had a large influence on {{the development}} of the style, but kept to its own dignified Gothic style throughout the period, and afterwards, while the flamboyant Visconti court at Milan, also closely related to the French royal family, was the most important Italian centre of the courtly style. As the style developed in Northern Europe, Italian artists were in turn influenced by it.|$|E
25|$|The {{diocese of}} Marga, attested between the eighth and fourteenth centuries and {{frequently}} mentioned in Thomas of Marga's Book of Governors, included {{a large number}} of villages and monasteries around ʿAqra. In the middle of the eighth century the diocese is known to have included the districts of Sapsapa (the Navkur plain south of ʿAqra, on the east bank of the Khazir river), Talana and Nahla d'Malka (two valleys around the upper course of the Khazir river) and Beth Rustaqa (the Gomel valley), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> also included several villages in the Zibar district. The metropolitan Maranʿammeh of Adiabene, who flourished {{in the third quarter of}} the eighth century, adjusted the boundaries of the dioceses of Dasen and Marga, transferring the districts of Nahla and Talana from Marga to Dasen and also assigning the Great Monastery to the diocese of Dasen.|$|E
25|$|Generals of Division Armand Lebrun de La Houssaye and Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge led {{one and a}} half {{divisions}} of cavalry. Houssaye commanded the 3rd Dragoon Division which consisted of the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 27th Dragoon Regiments. Lorge directed the 4th Dragoon Division which was made up of the 13th, 15th, 22nd, and 25th Dragoons. However, since February, one brigade of Lorge's dragoons had been detached to serve with Ney's corps. This unit was led by General of Brigade François Fournier <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> comprised the 15th and 25th Dragoons, which were still with the VI Corps at the Battle of Tamames in October 1809. General of Brigade Pierre Benoît Soult led the II Corps cavalry which included the 1st Hussar, 8th Dragoon, 22nd Chasseurs à Cheval, and Hanoverian Chevau-léger Regiments. The II Corps infantry divisions were led by Generals of Division Pierre Hugues Victoire Merle, Henri François Delaborde, and Étienne Heudelet de Bierre.|$|E

25|$|Scottish Protestantism {{was focused}} on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority. Many Bibles were large, {{illustrated}} and highly valuable objects. The Genevan translation was commonly used until in 1611 the Kirk adopted the Authorised King James Version and the first Scots version was printed in Scotland in 1633, but the Geneva Bible continued to be employed into the seventeenth century. Bibles often became the subject of superstitions, being used in divination. Kirk discipline was fundamental to Reformed Protestantism <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> reached a high-water mark in the seventeenth century. Kirk sessions were able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. In more difficult cases of immoral behaviour they could work with the local magistrate, in a system modelled on that employed in Geneva. Public occasions were treated with mistrust and from the later seventeenth century there were efforts by kirk sessions to stamp out activities such as well-dressing, bonfires, guising, penny weddings and dancing.|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, at a {{screening}} of Broadway Idiot, Mayer reported that the film adaptation was still happening, but production had not been scheduled due to [...] "Hollywood bullshit". In March 2014, playwright Rolin Jones told the Hartford Courant that he was writing a new screenplay for the film. Comparing it to the musical, Jones said, [...] "The {{idea is to get}} it a little dirtier and a little nastier and translate it into visual terms. There's {{not going to be a}} lot of dialogue <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> should be a little shorter, too. After that, it just takes its 'movie time' in getting done".

500|$|In the Himalayas, it is {{strongly}} associated with terrace cultivation, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> only spread to the Himalayas when these agricultural practices arrived 3000 to 4000 years ago. In towns where it occurs alongside the house or tree sparrow, it is found in gardens and less built up areas. In those hill stations in India where {{both the house and}} the russet sparrow occur, the house sparrow breeds around more-built up areas and bazaars, whereas the russet sparrow is [...] "rather more up market at the larger houses with gardens and open spaces". In towns where it is the only sparrow, it is not dependent on trees, breeding around houses and eating scraps in streets. In the winter, migratory birds occur in open cultivated land and riverine grasslands, but are never far from shrubs or trees.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{known only}} from skull domes, Stegoceras {{was one of}} the first known pachycephalosaurs, and the incompleteness of these initial remains led to many {{theories}} about the affinities of this group. A complete Stegoceras skull with associated parts of the skeleton was found in 1924, which shed more light on these animals. Pachycephalosaurs are today grouped with the horned ceratopsians in the group Marginocephalia. Stegoceras itself has been considered basal (or [...] "primitive") compared to other pachycephalosaurs. Stegoceras was most likely herbivorous, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> had a good sense of smell. The function of the dome has been debated, and competing theories include use in intra-specific combat (head or flank-butting), sexual display, or species recognition. S. validum is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation and the Oldman Formation, whereas S. novomexicanum is from the Fruitland and Kirtland Formation.|$|E
500|$|In 2005 Therrien {{and colleagues}} {{estimated}} the relative bite force of theropods (estimates in absolute values like newtons were impossible) {{and found that}} Giganotosaurus and related taxa had adaptations for capturing and bringing down prey by delivering powerful bites, whereas tyrannosaurs had adaptations for resisting torsional stress and crushing bones. The bite force of Giganotosaurus was weaker than that of Tyrannosaurus, and the force decreased hindwards along the tooth row. The lower jaws were adapted for slicing bites, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> captured and manipulated prey with the front part of the jaws. These authors suggested that Giganotosaurus and other allosaurs may have been generalised predators that fed on {{a wide spectrum of}} prey smaller than themselves, such as juvenile sauropods. The ventral process (or [...] "chin") of the lower jaw may have been an adaptation for resisting tensile stress when the powerful bite was delivered with the front of the jaws against the prey.|$|E
500|$|Alice and Louis's {{return to}} Darmstadt as Grand Duke and Duchess {{was met with}} celebration that Alice did not expect. However, she found her duties overwhelming, writing to her mother that she [...] "dreaded everything". Alice used her new role to reform the social {{conditions}} of Darmstadt, but found the responsibility of being Landesmutter (mother of her people) strenuous. In another letter to her mother, she wrote that her duties were [...] "more than she could stand in the long run". She was distressed by a rumour that she was once unkind to Louis's aunt, Grand Duchess Mathilde Caroline, and she was hurt by an unkind letter from Queen Victoria.
