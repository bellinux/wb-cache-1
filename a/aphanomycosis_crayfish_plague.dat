40|$|This is the <b>Aphanomycosis</b> of crayfish: <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> report {{produced}} by the Environment Agency in 2000. <b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> is an extremely virulent fungal disease of European crayfish species, the white clawed or stone crayfish of Western Europe Austropotamobius pallipes, the Noble crayfish of northern Europe Astacus astacus and the narrow clawed crayfish of Eastern Europe, Astacus leptodactylus. The white claw crayfish A. pallipes is the indigenous native crayfish of the British Isles. Until the early 1980 s there were extensive healthy populations of this crayfish in almost all suitable alkaline river and lake environments in England and Wales {{as far north as}} Northumberland. The conservation importance of this native crayfish is widely recognised. This report provides a general review of the literature of <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> including an overview of its spread through the British Isles from CEFAS records. Information on current diagnostic methods from the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) Aquatic Disease Manual is provided. Information on the taxonomy, morphology and physiology of the pathogen is reviewed, together with the pathogenicity and pathology of the disease and current means of prevention and control...|$|R
40|$|A recent PCR-test {{developed}} for identification of Aphanomyces astaci, the organism responsible for <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> provided false positives for Aphanomyces frigidophilus, Aphanomyces repetans, and some Saprolegnia spp. Real-time PCR showed {{that with the}} designed primers, A. astaci and A. frigidophilus cannot be distinguished.

40|$|Since 1907, {{coinciding with}} the arrival of the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> the noble <b>crayfish</b> (Astacus astacus) has {{steadily}} declined in Sweden. To substitute the noble crayfish fishery lost, mainly due to the plague, and since the species is highly susceptible to the disease, the Swedish government started a large-scale introduction of the American signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) in the end of the 1960 ’s. The signal crayfish is a chronic carrier of <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> (Aphanomyces astaci), and it is likely that the introduction of this species has had an effect on the spread of the disease to the remaining noble crayfish populations. 6, 961 <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> outbreaks were recorded between the years 1907 - 2004. 65 % of the recorded outbreaks (4, 531 records) occurred after 1969. The legislation for giving licenses to stock signal crayfish has gone from being restrictive in the end of the 1960 ’s, to becoming quite liberal in the 1980 ’s, and to becoming more restrictive again starting in 1994. From 1983 - 1994 the number of licenses increased with over 500 % (from 536 to 3, 000). This coincides with the largest number of recorded <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> outbreaks ever. To assess the relationship between the large-scale introduction of signal crayfish, the spread of <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> and the steady decline of noble crayfish populations in Swedish waters, we compared the number of outbreaks between two 20 -year periods, before and after the introduction of the signal crayfish. We found that the introduction of the signal crayfish, due to a more permissible legislation, have accelerated the spread of <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> to noble <b>crayfish</b> populations in the country, and that is the main reason for the current decline of native crayfish populations...|$|R
40|$|There {{are only}} very limited {{reports about the}} {{occurrence}} of the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> in Czechia. In recent years, mass mortalities of Astacus spp. with symptoms of possible <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> were noticed in three streams in the country two in Central Bohemia (1998 - 9) and one in Silesia (2004). Three dead individuals from the last outbreak were examined {{for the presence of}} the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> pathogen, Aphanomyces astaci, by observation of the presence of hyphae in their cuticle and by a PCR-based diagnostic method. In all three cases the detection was positive. Although causes of mass mortalities from two other localities lack such a direct confirmation, the indirect evidence supports the same conclusion. The main potential vector of A. astaci in Czechia is the American spiny-cheeck crayfish Orconectes limosus, widespread in large rivers of {{the western part of the}} country and in various isolated standing waters. Using the same molecular method, we investigated the presence of A. astaci in living O. limosus individuals from six localities (three running and three standing waters). The analysis indicated the presence of the pathogen in animals from five out of six investigated Orconectes populations. One of them is present in the stream where two European Astacus species had gone extinct in 1998 - 9. Our results suggest that the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> is still present in Czechia, and that populations of O. limosus represent a reservoir for the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> pathogen, which directly endangers populations of the native crayfish...|$|R

40|$|<b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> is {{a severe}} disease of European {{crayfish}} species and has rendered the indigenous crayfish populations vulnerable, endangered or even extinct {{in the most}} of Europe. <b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> is caused by an oomycete Aphanomyces astaci, a fungal-like water mould that lives its vegetative life in the cuticle of crayfish and infects other crayfish by producing zoospores. Zoospores swim around {{for a few days}} in search of crayfish, and when they find one they attach onto its surface, encyst and germinate to start a new growth cycle as new growing hyphae penetrate the crayfish tissues. Unrestricted growth of A. astaci leads to the death of the infected animal in just a few weeks. <b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> induced mortalities started in Italy around 1860. Although the disease was known about since 1860 its cause remained unknown for several decades. Little was done {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease. A lively crayfish trade probably facilitated the spread of the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> which reached Finland in 1893. The <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> has remained the most important disease problem of the Finnish noble crayfish Astacus astacus, since then. The consensus was that the disease killed all infected animals in a short time, and it appeared almost impossible to restore the flourishing crayfish populations to the levels that existed before. Following the example of neighbouring Sweden, a North American crayfish species, the signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus that appeared resistant to <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> was introduced to Finland in 1960 s. As expected, the signal crayfish slowly started to replace the lost populations of the noble crayfish to become an important part of the crayfish fisheries. The introduction of the signal crayfish significantly added to the management problems of the noble crayfish stocks left. Signal crayfish appeared to be a chronic carrier of the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> agent, and spread the disease to the dwindling vulnerable noble crayfish populations. Later research showed that the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> agent is a parasite of North American crayfish that in normal circumstances does not harm the host animal. Intriguingly, the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> agent carried by the signal crayfish, genotype Ps 1, is different from the pathogen originally introduced into Europe, genotype As. The diagnosis of <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> especially when based on the isolation of the pathogen is challenging and accordingly the genotype difference was mostly unrecognized until recently. In this study we determined the genotype of the causative agent from most of the detected Finnish <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> cases between 1996 - 2006. It appeared that most of the epidemics in the immediate vicinity of signal crayfish populations were caused by genotype Ps 1, whereas genotype As was more prevalent in the noble crayfish areas. Interestingly, a difference was seen in the outcome of the infection. The Ps 1 infection was always associated with acute mortalities, while As infections were also frequently found in existing but weak populations. The persistent nature of an As infection could be verified in noble crayfish from a small lake in southern Finland. This finding explained why many of the efforts to introduce a new noble crayfish population into a water body after a <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> induced mortality were futile. The main conclusion from the field study data of this research was the difference in virulence between the Ps 1 and As genotype strains. This was also verified in a challenge trial with noble crayfish. While the Ps 1 strains did not show much variation in their growth behaviour or virulence, there was much more variation in the As strains. The As genotype arrived in Finland more than 100 years ago, and since that date it seems to have adapted to the novel host, the noble crayfish, to some extent. In order to gain insight into a possible vector of this genotype, we studied another North American crayfish species present in Europe, the spiny-cheek crayfish Orconectes limosus from a Czech pond. This crayfish species appeared to carry a novel genotype of A. astaci, named Orconectes genotype, designated “Or”. It seems possible that many of the North American crayfish species carry their own type of <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> agent, with variable features such as virulence. These differences should be further tested in the future. The results of this study alleviate the necessity to study the noble crayfish mortalities for the verification of <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> including the study for the genotype of the A. astaci strain.

40|$|The carrier {{status and}} {{possible}} elevated tolerance {{of the signal}} crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) against the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> disease agent (Aphanomyces astaci) has been speculated for several decades. We studied experimentally {{the responses of the}} signal crayfish from two Finnish populations against the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> infection by using two <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> isolates with differing virulences; the highly virulent PsI-isolate and the mid virulent As-isolate. The studied signal crayfish came from two origins: the wild Leppävirta population and the Raukola farmed population of mixed genetic background. Both test groups were infected with A. astaci isolates using the challenge of 10 [*] 000 spores mL- 1. The isolates were PsI-Puujärvi (UEF 8866 - 2) from Lake Puujärvi signal crayfish (year 2003) and As-Kivesjärvi (Evira 6462 / 06) from Lake Kivesjärvi noble crayfish (year 2005 epidemic) in Finland. The crayfish were sampled prior to the experimental challenge with A. astaci to evaluate their A. astaci carrier status. The mortality, molting, feeding activity and other behavior of the crayfish were followed during the experiment. We observed increased mortality of the infected groups, related to the molting in some cases, and delayed molting. The impacts of the intense <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> infection on the signal crayfish were clear and the studied populations showed differences in their reactions that are potentially explained by differing physiological conditions and different molt cycle phase. The results show that infection of both tested <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> genotypes affects signal crayfish and is likely {{one of the main reasons}} behind losses among signal crayfish populations...|$|R
50|$|From 1907, <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} water mould Aphanomyces astaci, damaged stocks of the native European crayfish Astacus astacus.

40|$|ABSTRACT - The <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> pathogen, Aphanomyces astaci, is {{responsible}} for substantial declines and local extinctions of native European crayfish populations. As a consequence, the pathogen is now listed among 100 world's worst invasive alien species. The spread of A. astaci is greatly facilitated by its natural hosts, North American crayfish, that thanks to a long co-evolutionary history with the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> pathogen evolved efficient defence mechanisms. In contrast, European, Australian and Asian crayfish species are highly susceptible to this disease agent. However, progress of A. astaci infection in native European crayfish was observed to differ between distinct pathogen strains, indicating variability in their virulence. Indeed, we demonstrated a relationship between patterns in crayfish immune response and A. astaci virulence in an experimental infection involving the European noble crayfish and three differently virulent <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> strains. The European continent is currently inhabited by at least eight North American crayfish species. The carrier status was confirmed in six of them, including also Orconectes cf. virilis occurring in the Netherlands and the UK. In this country, we detected Aphanomyces astaci presence in some populations of the non-indigenous crayfish species as well [...] ...|$|R

Rapurutto on eurooppalaisten rapulajien vakavin tautiongelma, joka on saattanut kotoperäiset rapulajit uhanalaisiksi lähes kaikkialla Euroopassa. Rapuruton aiheuttaa leväsieni Aphanomyces astaci, joka elää sienenkaltaisena rihmastona ravun kuoressa, ja siirtyy isäntäeläimestä toiseen siimallisten uimaitiöiden välityksellä. Taudille herkät rapulajit eivät pysty rajoittamaan rihmaston kasvua tehokkaasti ja kuolevat yleensä tartuntaan parissa viikossa. Ensimmäiset rapujen joukkokuolemat raportoitiin Italiassa 1860 -luvulla, ja Suomeen tartunta levisi 1893. Siitä lähtien rapurutto on tuhonnut merkittävän osan Suomen alkuperäisen rapulajin jokiravun (Astacus astacus) kannoista. Tuhoutuneita kantoja korvaamaan tuotiin Pohjois-Amerikasta täplärapuja, jotka eivät olleet herkkiä taudille. Ne kuitenkin kantoivat taudinaiheuttajaa kuoressaan ja tartuttivat sitä edelleen jokirapuihin. Geneettisesti täplärapujen kantama rapurutto, genotyyppi Ps 1, eroaa alun perin Suomeen tulleesta taudinaiheuttajasta, genotyypistä As. Tässä tutkimuksessa määritettiin Suomessa vuosina 1996 - 2006 todettujen rapuruttotapausten genotyyppi. Täplärapujen esiintymisalueen läheisyydessä Etelä-Suomessa jokiravuilla esiintyi yleensä Ps 1 -tyypin aiheuttamia tartuntoja, kun taas muualla Suomessa As-tyypin rapurutto oli yleisempi. Ps 1 -tyyppi aiheutti aina rapukuolemia, kun taas As-tyyppiä löytyi usein myös heikoista jokirapukannoista. Rapukuoleman jälkeen heikkoon rapukantaan piileväksi jäänyt As-tyypin rapuruttotartunta todennettiin pienessä eteläsuomalaisessa järvessä. Genotyyppien välinen taudinaiheutuskyvyn ero todettiin myös kokeellisesti. Ps 1 -rapuruttokantojen välillä ei ollut merkittäviä eroja taudinaiheutuskyvyssä tai kasvunopeudessa, toisin kuin As-kannoilla. As-tyypin rapurutto näyttää sopeutuneen jossakin määrin uuteen isäntälajiinsa jokirapuun. Sen alkuperäistä isäntälajia ei tunneta. Tutkimme sen selvittämiseksi Eurooppaan tuotua toista rapulajia amerikkalaista kääpiörapua (Orconectes limosus), joka kuitenkin osoittautui aiemmin kuvaamattoman rapuruttotyypin Or kantajaksi. On mahdollista, että pohjoisamerikkalaisilla rapulajeilla esiintyy paljon enemmänkin lajinomaisia rapuruttotyyppejä, joiden ominaisuudet kuten taudinaiheutuskyky voivat poiketa toisistaan. Tämä tutkimus osoitti, että rapuruttotapaukset on varmistettava laboratoriotutkimuksella, joka sisältää myös rapuruton tyypin määrittämisen. Jokirapukantojen hoidossa on otettava huomioon piilevän rapuruton mahdollisuus. Siksi istutussuunnitelmiin täytyy aina sisällyttää sekä istukkaiden että vastaanottavan vesistön rapuruttotilanteen tutkiminen...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAphanomyces astaci is an {{invasive}} pathogenic oomycete {{responsible for}} the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> a disease that has devastated European freshwater crayfish. So far, five genotype groups of this pathogen have been identified by applying random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis on axenic cultures. To allow genotyping of A. astaci in host tissue samples, we have developed co-dominant microsatellite markers for this pathogen, tested them on pure cultures of all genotype groups, and subsequently evaluated their use on tissues of (1) natural A. astaci carriers, i. e., North American crayfish species, and (2) A. astaci-infected indigenous European species from <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> outbreaks. Out of over 200 potential loci containing simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs identified by 454 pyrosequencing of SSR-enriched library, we tested 25 loci with highest number of repeats, and finally selected nine that allow unambiguous separation of all known RAPD-defined genotype groups of A. astaci from axenic cultures. Using these markers, {{we were able to}} characterize A. astaci strains from DNA isolates from infected crayfish tissues when crayfish had a moderate to high agent level according to quantitative PCR analyses. The results support the hypothesis that different North American crayfish hosts carry different genotype groups of the pathogen, and confirm that multiple genotype groups, including the one originally introduced to Europe in the 19 th century, cause <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> outbreaks in Central Europe. So far undocumented A. astaci genotype seems to have caused one of the analysed outbreaks from the Czech Republic.

40|$|The <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> pathogen, Aphanomyces astaci, {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious threats to European {{indigenous}} crayfish species, e. g., the noble crayfish (Astacus astacus). The only way to protect susceptible crayfish species from the disease is to prevent the dispersion of the pathogen to their populations. One of the most important sources of the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> pathogen in Central Europe is the spiny-cheek crayfish (Orconectes limosus), a species of North American origin, which can carry the parasite in its cuticle for years. Some literature sources claimed that the pathogen dispersion from the American vectors is restricted to periods of moulting or to the time before and after the crayfish death. However, experimental evidence for such hypotheses was lacking. The main aim of my thesis was to test these predictions, and the alternative scenario that the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> pathogen can be transmitted from the infected spiny-cheek crayfish also in other periods. For this purpose, experiments were set up to investigate A. astaci transmission from infected spiny-cheek crayfish to non-infected spiny-cheek or noble crayfish.

The movement of disease-causing microfungi around the world has taken its toll on many different organisms, and continues to intensify with an increase in global transport of cargo, people, and animals. Those who study fungi have lit-tle information about the characteristics of invasive, zopathogenic fungi because of the fact that a particular fungus can inhabit many different organisms, and may be pathogenic to some of these hosts but not to the others. <b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> (Aphanomyces astaci) broke out through the Danube River to the territory of Bačka and Banat (today A.

All stocking sites were previously regarded as very good crayfish localities. Four years after stocking, natural recruitment was recorded at all adult crayfish stocking sites in the Glomma watercourse and at most sites in the Halden watercourse. Current crayfish density is, however, much lower than pre-plague densities even at the sites where population development has been in progress for more than 10 years. Extensive post-stocking movements were recorded among adult crayfish. Some sites seemed more suitable for settling, resulting in a great variation in CPUE between the different test-fishing sites.

Species of the genus Astacus are particularly susceptible to infection, allowing the plague-coevolved signal crayfish to invade parts of Europe.|$|R
40|$|The American spiny-cheek {{crayfish}} Orconectes limosus (Rafinesque, 1817) {{was found}} in the Lipno Reser-voir in July 2006. This is the most southerly situated record of the species in the Czech Republic, and also the site with the highest altitude in the country (726 m a. s. l.). The nearest known site with the presence of this crayfish is approximately 100 km downstream the Vltava River; it is therefore likely that this species was actively introduced by humans. As various Czech populations of this invasive species, including those from the Vltava River, have been proven to carry the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> pathogen, the presence of O. limosus in the Bohemian Forest potentially poses a serious threat to the native crayfish, and its future spread should be monitored. Key words: Orconectes limosus, Lipno Reservoir, invasive species, <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> Czech Republi...|$|R
50|$|The {{burrowing}} {{activities of}} P. clarkii {{can lead to}} damage to water courses and to crops, particularly rice, and its feeding can disrupt native ecosystems. It may out-compete the native crayfish species, and is a vector for the <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> fungus Aphanomyces astaci, for crayfish virus vibriosis, {{and a number of}} worms parasitic on vertebrates.|$|R
50|$|The Allen had {{the strongest}} {{population}} of white clawed crayfish in Dorset and {{measures such as}} tree planting and slowing {{the flow of the}} river down were implemented to help the species. However, an outbreak of <b>Crayfish</b> <b>Plague</b> was discovered on the river in 2014 with at least 100 of the native species found dead in the river.|$|R
50|$|Vårbyfjärden {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{maritime}} environments in Sweden to suffer <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> which hit the lake in 1907. The plague was introduced in Lake Mälaren by affected animals thrown into the water at Kornhamnstorg in central Stockholm, from where ships carrying crayfishes spread the disease further inland. Since then signal crayfish has been introduced.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> {{first arrived}} in Europe in Italy in 1859, either with {{imported}} crayfish from North America, or in ballast water. After its original introduction in Italy in 1860, it spread quickly through Europe and was discovered in Sweden in 1907, in Spain in 1972, in Norway in 1971, in Great Britain in 1981, in Turkey in 1984 and in Ireland in 1987.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} reasons for this decline is the {{introduction}} of the invasive North American signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). The signal crayfish is a carrier of <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> an infectious disease to which it has resistance while the native crayfish have none. The British species is also sensitive to many kinds of pollution, such as insecticides.|$|R
50|$|The river {{has been}} noted as being {{important}} for Bullhead and Lamphrey. It was previously a bastion for White Clawed Crayfish, {{but most of the}} species in this river were killed off with <b>Crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> in 2008. <b>Crayfish</b> have been noted in the tributaries of the Manifold and it is hoped that re-colonisation can be achieved by the surviving upstream crayfish.|$|R
50|$|The signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, is a North American {{species of}} crayfish. It was {{introduced}} to Europe in the 1960s to supplement the Scandinavian Astacus astacus fisheries, which were being damaged by <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague,</b> but the imports {{turned out to be}} a carrier of that disease. The signal crayfish is now considered an invasive species across Europe and Japan, ousting native species there.|$|R
40|$|Signal {{crayfish}} (Pacifastacus leniusculus) {{have existed}} in {{the upper reaches of}} Broadmead Brook in Wiltshire since 200 individuals were introduced at West Kington in 1981. The population has expanded upstream and downstream since this introduction, however, giving rise to concerns that it may potentially threaten the native crayfish population further downstream. Signal crayfish can act as a vector of <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> - a disease caused by the fungus Aphanomyces astaci Schikora which results in almost complete mortality to the native, white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes. The native crayfish in Broadmead Brook have not yet succumbed to <b>crayfish</b> <b>plague</b> and are currently free of the disease. However, as signal crayfish appear to out-compete the native species, the native population could still be under threat. In this article, we highlight the findings of previous crayfish surveys on Broadmead Brook and describe work undertaken in summer 2001 to map the current distribution of native and signal crayfish. Finally, options for controlling the spread of signal crayfish are discussed...|$|R
