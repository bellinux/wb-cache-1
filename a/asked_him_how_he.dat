5|$|Mitchell’s father (also named Colin) {{came from}} an Argyllshire fishing family. Mitchell (Snr) worked in a solicitor's office and for the MacBrayne ferry company before serving in the 10th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in World War I. Mitchell (Snr) {{achieved}} the rank of captain (commissioned ‘in the field’) and was awarded the Military Cross at the Second Battle of Ypres but when the young Colin <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> would only say, 'Oh, shooting rabbits'. He was badly gassed in 1918. After the war, {{he worked in the}} City of London and married a Glaswegian woman (née Gilmour) whose father worked as a manager for the LMS Railway company. The couple took up residence in the South London suburb of Purley where they had two children – Colin and Henrietta. The family lived in a modest semi-detached house and Colin would attend services at the local Presbyterian Church wearing a kilt.|$|E

Ganesha told him of his encounter with Narada and of the Brahmin's counsel.

25|$|In The Caves of Steel and its sequels (the {{first of}} which is The Naked Sun), Asimov paints a grim {{situation}} of an Earth dealing with an extremely large population, and of luxury-seeking Spacers who limit birth to permit great wealth and privacy. Asimov, who {{described himself as a}} claustrophile, mentioned that a reader <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> could have imagined such an existence with no sunlight, and related that it had not struck him until then that living perpetually indoors might be construed as unpleasant.|$|E

25|$|Israeli emigrants {{working in}} low status {{immigrant}} occupations that the diaspora Jewish population tends {{not to engage}} in or has long-ago abandoned such as taxi driving, auto repair, security guards, mall cart sales and other tasks. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir told of a waiter who once came over to her at a New York luncheon and whispered in Hebrew that there was ham in the dish she had been served. When she <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> knew Hebrew, he told her he was an Israeli. And what work had he done in Israel, she asked. He had been a waiter, he responded.|$|E
500|$|Waugh's Catholicism was fundamental: [...] "The Church... is {{the normal}} state of man from which men have disastrously exiled themselves." [...] He {{believed}} that the Catholic Church was the last, great defence against the encroachment of the Dark Age being ushered in by the welfare state and the spreading of working class culture. Strictly observant, Waugh admitted to Diana Cooper that his most difficult task was how to square the obligations of his faith with his indifference to his fellow men. When Nancy Mitford <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> reconciled his often objectionable conduct with being a Christian, Waugh replied that [...] "were he not a Christian he {{would be even more}} horrible".|$|E
500|$|Hoffman's older brother, Glenn, {{was nine}} years older and played shortstop in the Boston Red Sox organization. During summer {{vacation}} when Hoffman was 10 years old, he joined Glenn while he was playing in Pawtucket. His oldest brother, Greg, was 14 years Hoffman's senior and a mentor to his two younger brothers. [...] After Hoffman's first Little League game, Greg <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> did. Hoffman responded, [...] "I went 2-for-4, double, RBI." [...] to which Greg replied, [...] "That'll be the last (blanking) time {{you tell me how}} you did. When I ask you how you did, it's how the team did." [...] Hoffman never forgot that. Given their age difference, Hoffman considered his brothers more role models than playmates. [...] " [...] was the guide while Greg was the drill instructor", said Hoffman.|$|E

500|$|Cobain {{originally}} {{wanted to}} name the album I Hate Myself and I Want to Die, a phrase that had originated in his journals in mid-1992. [...] At the time, the singer used the phrase as a response whenever someone <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> was doing. [...] Cobain intended the album title as a joke; he stated he was [...] "tired of taking this band so seriously and everyone else taking it so seriously". [...] Novoselic convinced Cobain to change the title due to fear that it could potentially result in a lawsuit. [...] The band then considered using Verse Chorus Verse—a title taken from its song [...] "Verse Chorus Verse", and an earlier working title of [...] "Sappy"—before eventually settling on In Utero. [...] The final title was taken from a poem written by Courtney Love.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the group's self-titled debut took place from September to December 1991. The album {{was released on}} March 31, 1992, on compact disc, vinyl, and audio cassette. Ice-T states that Body Count was intentionally different from his solo hip hop albums in that [...] "An Ice T album has intelligence, and at times it has ignorance. Sometimes it has anger, sometimes it has questions. But Body Count was intended to reflect straight anger. It {{was supposed to be}} the voice of the angry brother, without answers. [...] If you took a kid and you put him in jail with a microphone and <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> feels, you'd get Body Count: 'Fuck that. Fuck school. Fuck the police.' You wouldn't get intelligence or compassion. You'd get raw anger." [...] From the album, [...] "There Goes The Neighborhood" [...] was released as a single, while [...] "Body Count's in the House" [...] was featured in the film Universal Soldier.|$|E
500|$|Before he {{shot his}} own head-smashing scene, {{he spoke to}} Gaspar Noé and <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> had done a similar scene in his film Irréversible (2002). Crossing the line from romance to violence, the scene begins with the Driver and Irene kissing tenderly. What they share is really a goodbye kiss, as he then becomes a [...] "werewolf," [...] violently stomping the hit man's head in. Subsequently, Irene sees the Driver in a new light. Of this scene Refn said: Every movie {{has to have a}} hearta place where it defines itselfand in every movie I've made there's always a scene that does that. On Drive, {{it was hard for me}} to wrap my head around it. I {{realized}} I needed to show in one situation that driver is the hopelessly romantic knight, but he's also completely psychotic and is willing to use any kind of violence to protect innocence. But that scene was never written. As I was going along, it just kind of popped up. In March 2012, Interiors, an online journal that is concerned with the relationship between architecture and film, released an issue that discussed how space is used in this scene. The issue highlights Refn's use of constricted space and his way of creating a balance between romance and violence.|$|E

2500|$|The {{commission}} specified {{a portrait}} of Napoleon standing in the uniform of the First Consul, probably {{in the spirit of}} the portraits that were later produced by Antoine-Jean Gros, Robert Lefèvre (...) and Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres (Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne), but David was keen to paint an equestrian scene. The Spanish ambassador, Ignacio Muzquiz, informed Napoleon and <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> would like to be represented. Napoleon initially requested to be shown reviewing the troops but eventually decided on a scene showing him crossing the Alps.|$|E
2500|$|Harold Takooshian, {{writing in}} Psychology Today, stated that: [...] "In his book, Rosenthal asked {{a series of}} {{behavioral}} scientists to explain why people do or do not help a victim and, sadly, he found none could offer an evidence-based answer. How ironic that this same question was answered separately by a non-scientist. When the killer was apprehended, and Chief of Detectives Albert Seedman <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> dared to attack a woman in front of so many witnesses, the psychopath calmly replied, 'I knew they wouldn't do anything, people never do' (Seedman & Hellman, 1974, p. 100)".|$|E

2500|$|By 1918 he {{had written}} {{hundreds}} of songs, mostly topical, which enjoyed brief popularity. Many of the songs were for the new dances then appearing, such as the [...] "grizzly bear", [...] "chicken walk", or fox trot. After a Hawaiian dance craze began, he wrote [...] "That Hula-Hula", and then did a string of southern songs, such as [...] "When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam". During this period, he was creating a few new songs every week, including songs aimed at the various immigrant cultures arriving from Europe. On one occasion, Berlin, whose face was still not known, was on a train trip and decided to entertain the fellow passengers with some music. They <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> knew so many hit songs, and Berlin modestly replied, [...] "I wrote them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Commission opened {{negotiations}} with the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache at Fort Sill on September 26, 1892. Jerome made an opening presentation, and Quanah Parker asked specifically how much money per acre, and what were the terms offered. Jerome stalled {{on the details of}} money. Other tribal members preferred to defer the negotiations until the Treaty of Medicine Lodge expired. [...] At the next day's session, Parker continued to press Jerome for financial details, as Jerome avoided discussing the money. Sayre detailed the overall offer of $2,000,000 and per capita distribution. Parker once again asked how much per acre. Sayre didn't have an answer, and Parker <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> arrived at $2,000,000. To that, Sayre replied, [...] "...we just guess at it." [...] Parker stated that he had heard about price per acre differential between the various tribal agreements. Lone Wolf added that many wanted to defer until the expiration of the Medicine Lodge treaty.|$|E

According to the sons, Madoff told Mark Madoff on December 9 that he planned to pay out $173 million in bonuses two months early. Madoff said that [...] "he had recently made profits through business operations, and that now was a good time to distribute it." [...] Mark told Andrew Madoff, and the next morning they went to their father's apartment and <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> could pay bonuses to his staff if he was having trouble paying clients. With Ruth Madoff nearby, Madoff told them he was [...] "finished," [...] that he had [...] "absolutely nothing" [...] left, and that his investment fund was [...] "just one big lie" [...] and [...] "basically, a giant Ponzi scheme." [...] According to their attorney, Madoff's sons then reported their father to federal authorities. On December 11, 2008, he was arrested and charged with securities fraud.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the legendary}} {{account of his}} life Christopher was {{initially}} called Reprobus. He was a Canaanite, 5 cubits (...) tall and with a fearsome face. While serving the king of Canaan, he took it into his head to go and serve [...] "the greatest king there was". He went to the king who was reputed to be the greatest, but one day he saw the king cross himself {{at the mention of}} the devil. On thus learning that the king feared the devil, he departed to look for the devil. He came across a band of marauders, one of whom declared himself to be the devil, so Christopher decided to serve him. But when he saw his new master avoid a wayside cross and found out that the devil feared Christ, he left him and enquired from people where to find Christ. He met a hermit who instructed him in the Christian faith. Christopher <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> could serve Christ. When the hermit suggested fasting and prayer, Christopher replied that he was unable to perform that service. The hermit then suggested that because of his size and strength Christopher could serve Christ by assisting people to cross a dangerous river, where they were perishing in the attempt. The hermit promised that this service would be pleasing to Christ.|$|E
2500|$|... when Isaac {{was old and}} {{his sight}} had dimmed, he called Esau {{and asked him to}} hunt some game and prepare a dish, so that Isaac might give him his {{innermost}} blessing before he died. Rebekah had been listening, and when Esau departed, she instructed Jacob to fetch her two choice kids so that she might prepare a dish that Jacob could take to Isaac and receive his blessing. Jacob complained to Rebekah that since Esau was hairy, Isaac might touch him, discover him to be a trickster, and curse him. But Rebekah called the curse upon herself, insisting that Jacob do as she directed. So Jacob got the kids, and Rebekah prepared a dish, had Jacob put on Esau's best clothes, and covered Jacob's hands and neck with the kid's skins. When Jacob went to Isaac, he asked which of his sons had arrived, and Jacob said that he was Esau and asked for Isaac's blessing. Isaac <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> had succeeded so quickly, and he said that God had granted him good fortune. Isaac asked Jacob to come closer that Isaac might feel him to determine whether he was really Esau. Isaac felt him and wondered that the voice was Jacob's, but the hands were Esau's. Isaac questioned if it was really Esau, and when Jacob assured him, Isaac asked for the game and Jacob served him the kids and wine. Isaac bade his son to come close and kiss him, and Isaac smelled his clothes, remarking that he smelled like the fields. The fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|The Tom Leykis Show had {{its last}} regular {{terrestrial}} broadcast on Friday, February 20, 2009, and ended at 5 p.m., {{the middle of}} its usual time slot. Leykis took calls until the last five minutes. At that point, the host mentioned that people had <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{was going to end}} the show. Saying [...] "Let's tell the truth", Leykis commented that he knew since the previous summer that it was possible the flagship station (KLSX, which originated the broadcast of the show) would switch format. Saying he [...] "tossed and turned", he thought about it and asked himself: [...] "What could I say that would wrap this all up? And then I one day heard this song … and I realized – the lyrics of this song … are about me." [...] With that, Leykis rolled into Joe Jackson's [...] "I'm the Man" [...] (the title track of Jackson's 1979 album). By the time the song was over, the studio was filled with people—as could be seen by the live online video broadcast on the station website. The host thanked his producers, the program director, the crowd in the studio, and everyone in southern California who made it [...] "12 great years", and he finished with [...] "Let's do this thing one more time..." [...] The crowd yelled [...] "Blow me up, Tom" [...] one last time to end the show and mark the end of KLSX as [...] "The FM Talk Station" [...] in what coincidentally became a strikingly appropriate catch phrase to be had: The phrase [...] "blow up the station" [...] is a radio term for ending a particular format or station run. After a much longer than usual explosion sound effect, the crowd cheered and KLSX changed format from hot talk to CHR/Top 40.|$|E
