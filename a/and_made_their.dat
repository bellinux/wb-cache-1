5|$|Herodotus {{does not}} mention {{specific}} figures for casualties, merely saying that losses were heavy on both sides. The Sicyonians in particular suffered, also losing their general Perilaus. On the Persian side, the admiral Mardontes and the general Tigranes were both killed, though Artayntes escaped. Herodotus says that a few Persians troops escaped the battle <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> way to Sardis. Diodorus claims that there were 40,000 Persian casualties, and also suggests that the survivors {{made their way to}} Sardis.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the gains}} {{provided}} by Harvey were outweighed by Lindwall's absence, which severely hampered Australia's bowling <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> eventual victory much more difficult. England made 441 and Australia reached their target of 98 {{on the final}} afternoon to complete an eight-wicket victory. Due to his injury, Lindwall was omitted from the team for the two matches {{leading up to the}} Second Test. Australia proceeded to defeat Northamptonshire by an innings before drawing with Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|If {{the late}} queen would have {{believed}} her men of war as she did her scribes, we had in her time beaten that great empire in pieces <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> kings of figs and oranges as in old times. But her Majesty did all by halves, and by petty invasions taught the Spaniard how to defend himself, and to see his own weakness.|$|E

5|$|Irataba {{moved on}} to Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., where he earned great acclaim; {{government}} officials and military officers lavished him with gifts of medals, swords, and photographs. In Washington he met with President Abraham Lincoln, who gave him a silver-headed cane. He was the first Native American from the Southwest to meet an American president. The tour ended in April, when he and Moss sailed to California, again by way of Panama, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> way back to Beale's Crossing from Los Angeles by wagon.|$|E
5|$|Laura Johnson and Harold Knight {{married in}} 1903 <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> {{first trip to}} the Netherlands in 1904. They spent six weeks there that year and six months there in 1905. They visited the artists colony at Laren. The colony was a group of {{followers}} of the Hague School of artists who had been painting in remote rural communities since the 1850s. The Knights made a third trip to Laren in 1906 before spending that winter in Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Shirayuki {{handed over}} the rescued seamen to troops on Endau the {{following}} day. They were never seen again, but {{are believed to have}} been executed in retaliation for losses sustained by the Japanese in an ambush by the Australian 2/18th Battalion, which occurred south of Mersing {{about the same time as}} the naval action off Endau. Davies, four other officers, and 61 ratings from Thanet managed to reach shore <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> way to Singapore, together with shot down aircrew.|$|E

5|$|Beginning around 1 pm, Union {{artillery}} fired first, initially upon infantry in the woods, {{and later}} upon any Confederate artillery that attempted {{to move into}} firing position. On the Confederate left flank, two batteries from Whiting's division and one from Jackson's soon began firing from their position upon Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, who were {{near the center of}} the Union line. This began a fierce firefight, with the Union's eight batteries and 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate batteries and sixteen guns. The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> position untenable. The other two Confederate batteries, placed by Jackson himself, were in somewhat better positions, and managed to keep firing. Over a period of more than three hours, a total of six or eight Confederate batteries engaged the Union Army from the Confederate left flank, but they were usually engaged only one at a time.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn Rovers {{were seeking}} {{to emulate the}} success of rivals Blackburn Olympic, who were the current holders of the trophy, and the team that Queen's Park {{defeated}} in the semi-final. Rovers had previously reached the FA Cup final, in 1882, where they were defeated by Old Etonians. Blackburn trained during the week prior to the game by conducting practise games and going for walks. They departed for the London area by train {{on the day before}} the final; a large crowd of local supporters gathered at the train station in Blackburn to wish them well as they left. The team stayed in Richmond the night before the match <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> way into the city at lunchtime on the Saturday.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} Jiajing reforms to {{document}} migrant workers and merchants, {{by the late}} Ming era the government census still did not accurately reflect the enormous growth in population. Gazetteers across the empire noted this <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> own estimations of the overall population in the Ming, some guessing that it had doubled, tripled, or even grown fivefold since 1368. Fairbank estimates that the population was perhaps 160 million in the late Ming dynasty, while Brook estimates 175 million, and Ebrey states perhaps as large as 200 million. However, a great epidemic that entered China through the northwest in 1641 ravaged the densely populated areas along the Grand Canal; a gazetteer in northern Zhejiang noted {{more than half the}} population fell ill that year and that 90% of the local populace in one area was dead by 1642.|$|E

5|$|From Bononia {{they crossed}} the Channel to Britain <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> way to Eboracum (York), capital of the {{province}} of Britannia Secunda and home to a large military base. Constantine was able to spend a year in northern Britain at his father's side, campaigning against the Picts beyond Hadrian's Wall {{in the summer and}} autumn. Constantius's campaign, like that of Septimius Severus before it, probably advanced far into the north without achieving great success. Constantius had become severely sick {{over the course of his}} reign, and died on 25 July 306 in Eboracum (York). Before dying, he declared his support for raising Constantine to the rank of full Augustus. The Alamannic king Chrocus, a barbarian taken into service under Constantius, then proclaimed Constantine as Augustus. The troops loyal to Constantius' memory followed him in acclamation. Gaul and Britain quickly accepted his rule; Hispania, which had been in his father's domain for less than a year, rejected it.|$|E
5|$|Gershkovitch {{married in}} Irkutsk in 1918. There, he {{established}} a fine arts conservatory and symphony orchestra which continued under the Bolshevik regime. In 1921, {{he and his wife}} crossed the border in China to escape from Russia. Ballerina Anna Pavlova offered Gershkovitch the assistant conductor position with her orchestra, which was touring throughout Asia. Gershkovitch remained in Japan to lead the newly organized Tokyo Symphony Orchestra. However, the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake disrupted the organization and caused Gershkovitch and his wife to emigrate to the United States. The couple arrived in San Francisco in November 1923 <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> way to Portland in 1924. There, Gershovitch was approached to lead the Portland Junior Symphony. Known for his discipline and high performance standards, Gershkovitch conducted the orchestra for twenty-nine years, gaining national attention for the ensemble and pioneering the youth orchestra movement until his death in 1953.|$|E
5|$|Ljotić was {{publicly}} {{denounced as}} a traitor by the Yugoslav government-in-exile and Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović in July 1942. He and other Serbian collaborationist officials left Belgrade in October 1944 <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> way to Slovenia, {{from where they}} intended to launch an assault against the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). Between March and April, Ljotić and Mihailović agreed to a last-ditch alliance against the Yugoslav Partisans and their forces came together {{under the command of}} Chetnik General Miodrag Damjanović on 27 March. Ljotić was killed in an automobile accident on 23 April and was buried in Šempeter pri Gorici. His funeral service was jointly conducted by Bishop Nikolaj Velimirović and Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Gavrilo Dožić, whose release from the Dachau concentration camp Ljotić had secured the previous December. In early May, Damjanović led the SDK–Chetnik formations under his command into northwestern Italy, where they surrendered to the British and were placed in detainment camps. Many were later extradited to Yugoslavia, where several thousand were executed by the Partisans and buried in mass graves in the Kočevski Rog plateau. Others immigrated to the west, where they established émigré organizations intended to promote Zbor's political agenda. The antagonism between these groups and those affiliated with the Chetniks continued in exile.|$|E

Methods of paper-making <b>and</b> {{printing}} <b>made</b> <b>their</b> way from China to Europe. During the Pax Mongolica rudimentary banking systems were established, and money changing and credit extension were common, resulting in {{large amount of}} merchant wealth.|$|R

5|$|Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray {{were born}} a week apart, played {{each other as}} juniors <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> Grand Slam tournament debuts in 2005. Djokovic made his ATP tour debut in 2004, while Murray's was in 2005, {{a time when many}} bright youngsters joined the ATP tour. They both reached the world top 100 in 2005, and the world top 20 in 2006. Djokovic, however, began to excel ahead of Murray, {{reaching}} one major final and two semifinals in 2007 and began to challenge Federer and Nadal regularly. He also won two Masters tournament titles and 5 titles in total, finishing the year ranked number 3 in world. Murray, who was forced out of the French Open and Wimbledon by injury, ended 2007 ranked 11th, winning two ATP tournaments.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April, Petrović and {{the staff}} of 1st Army Group {{headquarters}} were captured by Ustaše at Petrinja, and the rear area staff of 4th Army headquarters were captured by Ustaše at Topusko. The personnel of both headquarters were soon {{handed over to the}} Germans by their captors. Nedeljković and his operations staff escaped, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> way to Prijedor. Other units were retreating into Bosnia, including two battalions and 2–3 artillery batteries from the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska. Nedeljković attempted to deploy rear area units of the 17th Infantry Division Vrbaska into a defensive line along the Una at Bosanska Dubica, Bosanska Kostajnica, Bosanski Novi, Bosanska Krupa and Bihać, and called Sarajevo to request reinforcements. With his remaining troops, Raketić attempted to establish a defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and the mouth of the Vrbas. These efforts were significantly hampered by Ustaše propaganda.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, men {{claiming}} to be {{acting on behalf of}} Baxter supporters hijacked a train from Memphis, Tennessee, and arrested federal Court Justices John E. Bennett and E.J. Earle, thinking that the Court would be unable to rule without a quorum of Judges. Baxter denied that they were acting under his direction. The Judges were taken to Benton, Arkansas. For several days, their whereabouts were unknown to the public and federal officials began a search for the Justices. Justice Bennett was able to send a letter to Captain Rose demanding to know why they were being held by the Governor of Arkansas. Upon receipt of the letter, troops were sent to Benton to retrieve the two Justices, but they had escaped by May 6 <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> way to Little Rock.|$|E

5|$|The American {{rock band}} Rise Against has {{recorded}} 130 songs, which include 117 original songs and 13 covers. The band {{was formed in}} 1999, and signed a recording contract with the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords the following year. Under this label, they released The Unraveling (2001) and Revolutions per Minute (2003), which helped to establish an early fanbase. Afterwards, the band signed with Geffen Records, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> major record label debut with Siren Song of the Counter Culture (2004), which was followed by The Sufferer & the Witness (2006). Both albums charted on the Billboard 200, with the latter peaking at number ten. Rise Against's popularity continued to grow when they switched labels once again to DGC and Interscope Records. Their next three albums—Appeal to Reason (2008), Endgame (2011), and The Black Market (2014)—charted highly worldwide. Rise Against's eighth album, Wolves, was released in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Within {{six months}} of his return to Britain in 1943, Barbirolli resumed his {{contract}} with HMV, conducting the Hallé in the Third Symphony of Bax and the Fifth of Vaughan Williams, followed by works by {{a wide range of}} composers from Corelli to Stravinsky. In 1955 he signed a contract with Pye Records, with whom he and the Hallé recorded a wide repertoire, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> first stereophonic recordings. These records were distributed in the US by Vanguard Records. A company was formed, named Pye-Barbirolli, of which he was a director: the arrangement was designed to ensure an equal partnership between the company and the musicians. They made many recordings, including symphonies by Beethoven, Dvořák, Elgar, Mozart, Nielsen, Sibelius, Mahler, Tchaikovsky and Vaughan Williams, as well as a few concertos, short orchestral pieces and operatic excerpts.|$|E

With his remaining troops, Raketić attempted to establish a defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and the mouth of the Vrbas. These efforts were significantly hampered by Ustaše propaganda. The German orders for the following day were to pursue the remnants of the Yugoslav Army through Bosnia towards Sarajevo, where they would be met by the First Panzer Group attacking from the south and east. The 8th Panzer Division and 16th Motorised Infantry Division faced almost no resistance as they drove east towards Belgrade, capturing Našice, Osijek, Vinkovci and Vukovar during the day. On the night of 11/12 April, they captured Sremska Mitrovica, Ruma and secured a crossing over the Danube via an undamaged bridge near Bogojevo.|$|E
