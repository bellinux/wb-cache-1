5|$|Animal {{husbandry}} has {{a significant}} impact on the world environment. It is responsible for somewhere between 20 and 33% of the fresh water usage in the world, and livestock, and the production of feed for them, occupy about a third of the earth's ice-free land. Livestock production is a contributing factor in species extinction, desertification, and habitat destruction. Animal agriculture contributes to species extinction in various ways. Habitat is destroyed by clearing forests and converting land to grow feed crops and for <b>animal</b> <b>grazing,</b> while predators and herbivores are frequently targeted and hunted because of a perceived threat to livestock profits; for example, animal husbandry is responsible for up to 91% of the deforestation in the Amazon region. In addition, livestock produce greenhouse gases. Cows produce some 570 million cubic metres of methane per day. Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of the powerful and long-lived greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. As a result, ways of mitigating animal husbandry's environmental impact are being studied. Strategies include using biogas from manure.|$|E

Prior to its {{conversion}} as a park, {{the land was}} used primarily for <b>animal</b> <b>grazing,</b> although {{much of it was}} wooded. By 1893 the land was carved into six estates, including Cochran's (which was sold to the city after his death in 1889). The other estates belonged to the Bonnycastle , Barret , Morton & Griswold , Alexander [...] families, respectively. Those and two small lots under [...] were bought by 1891. Additional land from the Longest, Barringer and Belknap families would be added to expand the park to its modern size.|$|E

Weaddress this question by analyzing the problem faced by a privaterancher who wishes to minimize the long run expected net unit cost (LRENC) from range operations by choosing either the stocking rate or the length of time during which his <b>animals</b> <b>graze</b> hisrangeland. We construct a renewal-theoretic model and show that,in general, this rancher's LRENC with an optimally chosen stocking rate is lower than his LRENC with an optimally chosen grazing cycle length. From a management perspective, this means that correct stocking of the range {{is more important than the}} length of time during which <b>animals</b> <b>graze</b> the range. In addition, our research shows how to address questions concerning the desirability of temporal versus non-temporal controls in managing naturalresources such as fisheries and hunting grounds.

2500|$|The Mt Pilot spider orchid (Caladenia pilotensis) {{is a rare}} orchid species {{currently}} {{listed as}} threatened under the [...] and endangered by the Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE). [...] The species is described as having a hairy stem that grows to approximately [...] in height, a single basal leaf and light green to yellow coloured flower with pale red shading. [...] The deciduous herb originates from a population of approximately 100 individuals located inside a [...] radius in the Mt-Pilot section of the park. [...] It {{can be found in}} four small groups on the well drained soils of the open grassy forest floor. [...] Little is known about the ecology of this orchid but it is reported that pollination is severely restricted or absent in small populations. [...] This problem is exacerbated by a decline in the rate of flowering as the eucalyptus forests recover from the 2003 bushfires. [...] The risk of local extinction is high owing to the small population size and the threat of <b>animal</b> <b>grazing,</b> soil disturbance and weed invasion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tower was}} {{designed}} by Rodgers and Poor, a New York City architectural firm; the design was officially selected on February 14, 1930. Prior to the memorial's construction, the War Department selected Captain William H. Kindervater of the Quartermaster Corps to prepare the site for construction and to manage the area landscaping. To secure the sandy foundation, Captain Kindervater selected bermuda grass to be planted on Kill Devil Hill and the surrounding area. He also ordered a special fertilizer to be spread throughout the area to promote grass and shrubbery growth and decided to build a fence to prevent <b>animal</b> <b>grazing.</b> With a strong foundation in place, the Office of the Quartermaster selected Marine Captain John A. Gilman to preside over the construction project. Construction began in October 1931 and with a budget of $213,000, the memorial was completed in November 1932. In the end, 1,200 tons of granite, more than 2,000 tons of gravel, more than 800 tons of sand and almost 400 tons of cement were used to build the structure, along with numerous other materials. [...] It is constructed of granite mined at the North Carolina Granite Corporation Quarry Complex.|$|E
