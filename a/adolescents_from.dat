2500|$|... "Criança Feliz" [...] (Happy Child) had {{the same}} objective, {{eliminating}} child exploitation, but used a different approach. It was begun by a women's organisation and offered after-school activities {{with the goal of}} discouraging children and <b>adolescents</b> <b>from</b> working in sex tourism. Besides giving classes and training in computers, English, art, and karate, it also offered psychological services and group therapy. These combined services sought to equip children not only with skills but also a positive self-image and respect to not fall into prostitution. As all the kids came from very poor backgrounds, the financial pull of prostitution was very high. Criança Feliz worked at educating them about the high costs in the long term. This was a very interesting project, since it was actually a house with groups of kids divided into participating in different activities.|$|E
2500|$|When the Hitler Youth {{was devoted}} to {{organizing}} the extra-curricular life of male adolescents, the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM), occupied [...] female <b>adolescents</b> <b>from</b> 14 to 18 years. Founded in 1934, the movement was needed after the law of December 1, 1936. It was led from 1934 to 1937 by Trude Mohr, then from 1937 to 1945 by the psychologist Jutta Rüdiger. Young girls were trained for certain employment (social work, cleaning) or farming (Ernteeinsatz, helping with harvest) and practised sports but shockingly, as the education manual Das kommende Deutschland shows, the physical performance demanded was sometimes {{the same as those}} of the boys (for example, to run 60 meters in less than 12 seconds). [...] Every Wednesday evening, for girls from 15 to 20 years old, the [...] " [...] home parties [...] " [...] took place, for discussing art and culture. Vacation camps, held for one week during Summer, in Germany or abroad, were organized. There also existed a required six-month work service, the Reichsarbeitsdienst der weiblichen Jugend (National Young Women's Work Service), completed in 1941 with six extra months in the Kriegshilfsdienst (for the war effort). For young women aged 18 to 25 years old wishing to find work, in 1938 the Pflichtjahr was instituted, one year of obligatory service in farming or domestic work.|$|E

50|$|Among {{the most}} famous sculptures {{covering}} Archaic Greece are the Munich Kouros (statue of an <b>adolescent</b> <b>from</b> Attica, c. 540 BC), the Kouros of Tenea (statue of an <b>adolescent</b> <b>from</b> Corinth, c. 560 BC) and the temple figures from Aegina (510-480 BC). Of the latter, there are in fact two sets of similar sculptures at the Glyptothek. As archeologists excavated the site at Aegina, these two sets were discovered, and it was later theorized that the original temple was destroyed during the Peloponnesian War and another temple was erected shortly after in its place. The extant temple of c. 500 BC was built over the remains of an earlier temple of c. 570 BC, which was destroyed by fire c. 510 BC. The elements of this destroyed temple were buried in the infill for the larger, flat terrace of the later temple, and are thus well preserved.|$|R
60|$|I do {{not think}} that our {{educational}} and university authorities realize how far the college stage of education has already escaped from the local limitations of colleges; they do not understand what a great and growing volume of adolescent learning and thought, of college education in the highest and best sense of the word, goes on outside the walls of colleges altogether; and on the other they do not grasp the significant fact that, thanks to the high organization of sports and amusements and social life in our more prosperous universities, a great proportion of the youngsters who come in to their colleges never get the realities of a college education at all, and go out into the world again as shallow and uneducated as they came in. And this failure to grasp the great change in educational conditions brought about, for the most part, in the last half-century, accounts for the fact that when we think of any extension of higher education in the modern community we are all too apt {{to think of it as}} a great proliferation of expensive, pretentious college buildings and a great multiplication of little teaching professorships, and a further segregation of so many hundreds or thousands of our <b>adolescents</b> <b>from</b> the general community, when as a matter of fact the reality of education has ceased to lie in that direction at all. The modern task is not to multiply teachers but to exalt and intensify exceptionally good teachers, to recognize their close relationship with the work of university research--which it is their business to digest and interpret--and to secure the production and wide distribution of books throughout the community.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{case study}} on {{adolescent}} babysitting in the United States, which is a popular phenomenon nowadays in some communities. The author interviewed people {{in their late teens}} or twenties and parents from the United States. The former group was asked about their experiences as a babysitter and their experiences of having babysat in early childhood. The latter group was asked about experiences in hiring a teenage babysitter. The data illustrated the perspectives of three parties-babysitter, babysittee, and parent. By exploring the babysitting system, this paper attempts to illustrate two important aspects of the system; (1) How the babysitting system can ser ve as a nurturance formation device and (2) how it accelerates the transition of an <b>adolescent</b> <b>from</b> childhood to adulthood. In conclusion, the babysitting system was considered that (1) adolescent babysitters develop nur turance through structured and unstructured education and (2) the experience of undertaking a temporary parent/adult role makes for a smooth transition of the <b>adolescent</b> <b>from</b> childhood to adulthood. We hope to provide an effective view of resolving the difficulties that Japanese society currently faces by shedding light on the babysitting system in North America...|$|R
