5|$|The Nazi {{government}} quickly {{negotiated a}} deal in which the Swiss burned the Bf 110under the supervision of German observers {{in return for a}} sale to the Swiss of 12new Bf 109G-6 Gustav to replace combat losses. The new fighters were delivered in batches of six on 20and 22May. The new planes had serious manufacturing defects from the poor workmanship and production disruptions caused by <b>Allied</b> <b>bombings,</b> and after complaints the Germans refunded half of the six million Swiss franc purchase price.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1899, {{construction}} {{had started}} on shoplots, a pier and government buildings. This new administrative centre was renamed Jesselton after Sir Charles Jessel, who was the then Vice-Chairman of BNBC. Eventually, Jesselton became a major trading post of North Borneo, dealing in rubber, rattan, honey, and wax. The North Borneo Railway was used to transport goods to the Jesselton harbour. The Malay and Bajau uprisings during those times were not uncommon, and BNBC worked to quell the long-standing threat of piracy in the region. Jesselton suffered a large-scale destruction when it was razed by the British in their retreat from the Japanese and suffered more destruction when the Allies bombed it in 1945. After the Japanese takeover of Borneo, it was again renamed Api. Several rebellions against the Japanese military administration took place in Api. One major rebellion in the town occurred on 10 October 1943 by a group called Kinabalu Guerrillas in the Jesselton Revolt consisting of local inhabitants. Japanese forces quelled the rebellion after its leader, Albert Kwok, was arrested and executed in 1944. At the later stages of the war, {{what remained of the}} town was destroyed again by <b>Allied</b> <b>bombings</b> day and night for over six months as part of the Borneo Campaign in 1945, leaving only three buildings standing. The war in North Borneo ended with the official surrender of the Japanese 37th Army by Lieutenant General Baba Masao in Labuan on 10 September 1945.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} <b>Allied</b> <b>bombings</b> of Skattøra. The first was on 26 August 1940, {{conducted}} by a British Supermarine Walrus. The second took place on 12 April 1942, when the aerodrome was hit by bombs from a Soviet Ilyushin DB-3. Damage was limited to a few blasted oil drums and a few injured soldiers.|$|E

25|$|Switzerland, {{surrounded}} by Axis-controlled territory, also suffered from <b>Allied</b> <b>bombings</b> during the war; most notably from the accidental bombing of Schaffhausen by American planes on April 1, 1944. It was mistaken for Ludwigshafen am Rhein, a German town 284 kilometres away. 40 {{people were killed}} and over 50 buildings destroyed, among them a group of small factories producing anti-aircraft shells, ball-bearings, and Bf-109 parts for Germany.|$|E
25|$|Any {{reference}} {{in the script}} to the devastation caused by the <b>Allied</b> <b>bombings</b> was removed. In the script, Shukichi remarks to Onodera’s wife in Kyoto that her city is a very nice place, unlike Tokyo, with all its ruins. The censors deleted the reference to ruins (as an implied critique of the Allies) and, in the finished film, the word “hokorippoi” (“dusty”) was substituted as a description of Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|In January 1941, {{the city}} {{was the scene of}} the Legionnaires' {{rebellion}} and Bucharest pogrom. As the capital of an Axis country and a major transit point for Axis troops en route to the Eastern Front, Bucharest suffered heavy damage during World War II due to <b>Allied</b> <b>bombings.</b> On 23 August 1944, Bucharest was the site of the royal coup which brought Romania into the Allied camp. The city suffered a short period of Nazi Luftwaffe bombings, as well as a failed attempt by German troops to regain the city.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the end of}} the 19th {{century and}} the {{beginning}} of the 20th, Porto was the subject of a demolition and urban renewal program. Its strategic location near the port made it a target of <b>Allied</b> Forces <b>bombings</b> during World War II.|$|R

50|$|Many of the mannerist {{structures}} in Poland are postwar reconstructions. They {{were destroyed by}} the Germans during the World War II (e.g. all mannerist constructions in Warsaw, many Jewish pray houses) or damaged in <b>Allied</b> aerial <b>bombings</b> (Gdańsk, Wrocław). Also many were not restored after the war (e.g. tomb monument of Wolski Brothers in Warsaw by Jan Michałowicz destroyed in 1944; or Tarnów Synagogue, destroyed in 1939).|$|R
25|$|After the war, {{these crimes}} were tried at {{what became known}} as the Doctors' Trial, and revulsion at the abuses perpetrated led to the {{development}} of the Nuremberg Code of medical ethics. The Nazi physicians in the Doctors' trial argued that military necessity justified their torturous experiments, and compared their victims to collateral damage from <b>Allied</b> <b>bombings.</b> But this defense, which was in any case rejected by the Tribunal, cannot apply to the twin experiments of Josef Mengele, which were performed on children and had no connection to military necessity.|$|E
25|$|The {{proportion}} of military {{spending in the}} German economy began growing rapidly after 1942, as the Nazi government was forced to dedicate {{more and more of}} the country's economic resources to fighting a losing war. Civilian factories were converted to military use and placed under military administration. By late 1944, almost the entire German economy was dedicated to military production. At the same time, <b>Allied</b> <b>bombings</b> were destroying German factories and cities at a rapid pace, leading to the final collapse of the German war economy in 1945.|$|E
25|$|The {{third and}} fourth points say {{that the size of}} the Dresden raid—in terms of numbers, types of bombs and the means of delivery—were {{commensurate}} with the military objective and similar to other <b>Allied</b> <b>bombings.</b> On 23 February 1945, the Allies bombed Pforzheim and caused an estimated 20,000 civilian fatalities; the most devastating raid on any city was on Tokyo on 9–10 March (the Meetinghouse raid) caused over 100,000 civilian casualties. The tonnage and types of bombs listed in the service records of the Dresden raid were comparable to (or less than) throw weights of bombs dropped in other air attacks carried out in 1945. In the case of Dresden, as in many other similar attacks, the hour break in between the RAF raids was a deliberate ploy to attack the fire fighters and rescue crews.|$|E
25|$|The {{offensive}} commenced on 16 November 1944 {{with one}} of the heaviest <b>Allied</b> tactical <b>bombings</b> of the war. However, Allied advance was unexpectedly slow, against heavy German resistance, especially in the Hürtgen Forest through which the main thrust of the offensive was carried out. By mid-December the Allies finally reached the Rur and tried to capture its important dams, when the Germans launched their own offensive dubbed Wacht am Rhein. The ensuing Battle of the Bulge led to the immediate cessation of the Allied offensive efforts into Germany until February 1945.|$|R
50|$|The city of Düren {{was located}} on the main {{fighting}} front during the Allied invasion of Germany in World War II. During 1944 and 1945, the protracted and bloody Battle for Hürtgenwald was fought on Düren's district area, and on November 16, 1944, Düren was completely destroyed by <b>Allied</b> air <b>bombings.</b> Approximately 22,000 people lived in Düren at that time, and 3,000 of them died during the bombing. Those who survived were evacuated to central Germany. Destroyed buildings included the Stadttheater Düren (1907), designed in Jugendstil by Carl Moritz.|$|R

25|$|The only {{example of}} the Ca.1 survived its {{operational}} history and, after being superseded by the Ca.2 and subsequent developments, was stored in a warehouse. Conscious of its historical importance, Caproni preserved it with care. In 1927 Gianni Caproni, with the collaboration of his wife Timina Guasti Caproni, opened the Caproni Museum in Taliedo. The Ca.1 was displayed there in 1939, alongside several other historical aircraft, objects and documents connected to the first pioneer flights in Italy. The museum was closed during the Second World War and the Ca.1 {{was moved to the}} villa of the Caproni family in Venegono Superiore in order to be safe from <b>Allied</b> <b>bombings.</b> It remained there until 2007. It underwent a restoration process and was finally put on display in the Volandia aviation museum, not far from the Malpensa Airport. The Ca.1 is the oldest preserved aircraft in Italy.|$|E
25|$|By early 1942, Italy's {{military}} position {{had become}} untenable. After the defeat at El Alamein {{at the end}} of 1942, the Axis troops had to retreat to where they were finally defeated in the Tunisia Campaign in early 1943. Italy suffered major setbacks on the Eastern Front as well. The Allied invasion of Sicily brought the war to the nation's very doorstep. The Italian home front was also in bad shape as the <b>Allied</b> <b>bombings</b> were taking their toll. Factories all over Italy were brought to a virtual standstill because raw materials, such as coal and oil, were lacking. Additionally, there was a chronic shortage of food, and what food was available was being sold at nearly confiscatory prices. Mussolini's once-ubiquitous propaganda machine lost its grip on the people; a large number of Italians turned to Vatican Radio or Radio London for more accurate news coverage. Discontent came to a head in March 1943 with a wave of labor strikes in the industrial north—the first large-scale strikes since 1925. Also in March, some of the major factories in Milan and Turin stopped production to secure evacuation allowances for workers' families. The German presence in Italy had sharply turned public opinion against Mussolini; for example, when the Allies invaded Sicily, the majority of the public there welcomed them as liberators.|$|E
25|$|Large-scale <b>Allied</b> <b>bombings</b> of Bucharest {{took place}} in spring 1944, while the Soviet Red Army {{approached}} Romanian borders. The Battle for Romania began in late summer: while German commanders Johannes Frießner and Otto Wöhler of the Army Group South Ukraine attempted to hold Bukovina, Soviet Steppe Front leader Rodion Malinovsky stormed into the areas of Moldavia defended by Petre Dumitrescu's troops. In reaction, Antonescu attempted to stabilize the front on a line between Focșani, Nămoloasa and Brăila, deep inside Romanian territory. On August 5, he visited Hitler one final time in Kętrzyn. On this occasion, the German leader reportedly explained that his people had betrayed the Nazi cause, {{and asked him if}} Romania would go on fighting (to which Antonescu reportedly answered in vague terms). After Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov more than once stated that the Soviet Union was not going to require Romanian subservience, the factions opposing Antonescu agreed that the moment had come to overthrow him, by carrying out the Royal Coup of August 23. On that day, the sovereign asked Antonescu to meet him in the royal palace building, where he presented him with a request to take Romania out of its Axis alliance. The Conducător refused, and was promptly arrested by soldiers of the guard, being replaced as Premier with General Constantin Sănătescu, who presided over a national government.|$|E
50|$|W. G. Sebald {{sees the}} {{opposite}} end of the conventional determination in showing that German amnesia surrounding the <b>Allied</b> carpet <b>bombings</b> of 131 German cities and towns turned many German cities into vast necropolises, and resulted in an estimated 600,000 primarily civilian deaths, with millions of internal refugees. It was also said, however, that the politics of memory could contribute to the formation of strategies for achieving reconciliation in post-conflict situations. It can be used by activists, equity workers, policy analysts and academics to address existing paradigms in order to achieve some semblance of justice and reconciliation in the aftermath of deep internal conflict.|$|R

In 1946 a print of the 85-minute version was found in a box and a new print was made from it. This version was occasionally screened at film clubs, cinematheques and film festivals, and its reputation slowly began to grow. It finally premiered in New York City in April 1950, but it was critically unsuccessful.

Operation Husky, the codename for the Allied invasion of Sicily, was launched on the night between 9–10 July 1943 with British forces attacking {{the west of the}} island. The British 5th Infantry Division, part of General Sir Bernard Montgomery's Eighth Army, captured Syracuse {{on the first day of}} the invasion almost unopposed. The port was then used as a base for the British Royal Navy. To the west of the city is a Commonwealth War Graves cemetery where about 1,000 men are buried.

2500|$|Ultimately, Hitler {{was trapped}} {{within his own}} vision of bombing as a terror weapon, formed in the 1930s when he {{threatened}} smaller nations into accepting German rule rather than submit to air bombardment. This fact had important implications. It showed {{the extent to which}} Hitler personally mistook Allied strategy for one of morale breaking instead of one of economic warfare, with the collapse of morale as an additional bonus. Hitler was much more attracted to the political aspects of bombing. As the mere threat of it had produced diplomatic results in the 1930s, he expected that the threat of German retaliation would persuade the Allies to adopt a policy of moderation and not to begin a policy of unrestricted bombing. His hope was — for reasons of political prestige within Germany itself — that the German population would be protected from the <b>Allied</b> <b>bombings.</b> When this proved impossible, he began to fear that popular feeling would turn against his regime, and he redoubled efforts to mount a similar [...] "terror offensive" [...] against Britain in order to produce a stalemate in which both sides would hesitate to use bombing at all.|$|E
2500|$|During the Japanese {{occupation}} of Korea (particularly during World War II), Japan mobilized 700,000 laborers from Korea to sustain industrial production, mainly in mining. Some of them eventually returned to Korea after the war, with some dying in Japan during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, {{or the other}} <b>Allied</b> <b>bombings</b> of Japan. The high death toll may also have had other causes in the harsh conditions of the war. [...] Corporations, such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui and others, stated that the culpability should fall on the government and not on private companies. The government distributed funds to companies {{for the purposes of}} worker repatriation. Japanese companies paid out sums {{at the end of the}} war to Chinese work leaders intended for Chinese labourers to return home to China, but the money went missing after distribution to the Chinese workers. Later, the People's Republic of China and South Korea requested help in finding the dead bodies of kidnapped Chinese and Korean laborers for proper burial. The situation prevented China and South Korea from appropriately coordinating their efforts, and they have only identified a few hundred bodies. In addition, Korean workers began demanding their unpaid wages immediately after Japan's surrender and continue to do so today. The issue remains salient in South Korea.|$|E
