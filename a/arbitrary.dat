5|$|All medieval Muslim jurists {{rejected}} <b>arbitrary</b> opinion, {{and instead}} developed various secondary sources, {{also known as}} juristic principles or doctrines, to follow in case the primary sources (i.e. the Qur'an and Sunnah) are silent on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Augustus' public revenue reforms had a {{great impact}} on the {{subsequent}} success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat <b>arbitrary</b> tributes from each local province as Augustus' predecessors had done. This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new <b>arbitrary</b> exaction of tribute.|$|E
5|$|However, {{it is by}} {{no means}} an <b>arbitrary</b> convention, because not {{adopting}} it forces one either to invent strange new objects or to abandon some of the familiar rules of arithmetic.|$|E
5|$|However, it is {{unlikely}} that such a subexponential time bound is possible for the clique problem in <b>arbitrary</b> graphs, as it would imply similarly subexponential bounds for many other standard NP-complete problems.|$|E

5|$|If {{edges are}} {{required}} to be drawn as straight line segments, rather than <b>arbitrary</b> curves, then some graphs need more crossings than they would when drawn with curved edges.|$|E

5|$|Some {{algorithms}} become simpler {{when used}} on DAGs instead of general graphs, {{based on the}} principle of topological ordering. For example, it is possible to find shortest paths and longest paths from a given starting vertex in DAGs in linear time by processing the vertices in a topological order, and calculating the path length for each vertex to be the minimum or maximum length obtained via any of its incoming edges. In contrast, for <b>arbitrary</b> graphs the shortest path may require slower algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman–Ford algorithm, and longest paths in <b>arbitrary</b> graphs are NP-hard to find.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test {{is to ensure that}} the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be <b>arbitrary.</b> Lastly, the basis of classification must not be <b>arbitrary</b> but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} open {{problems}} concerning book thickness. It is unknown whether the book thickness of an <b>arbitrary</b> graph can be bounded by {{a function of}} the book thickness of its subdivisions.|$|E

5|$|In the Arthurian legends, each {{knight of}} the Round Table is often {{accompanied}} by a heraldic description of a coat of arms. Although these arms could be <b>arbitrary,</b> some characters were traditionally associated with one coat or a few different coats.|$|E
5|$|The {{subjective}} test was rejected {{for several reasons}} by the Court of Appeal. It held that applying the {{subjective test}} to sections 8 and 10 of the ISA would render the provisions unconstitutional. The word law in Article 12(1) of the Constitution was held in Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980) to encompass fundamental rules of natural justice. Hence, Parliament cannot pass legislation which authorizes the executive to exercise power in breach of these fundamental rules or to exercise power in an <b>arbitrary</b> manner. If the subjective test were to be adopted, it would in effect allow the executive to exercise <b>arbitrary</b> powers of detention, therefore rendering sections8 and 10 of the ISA inconsistent with Article12(1). When the case was decided, Article149(1) of the Constitution, which protects the validity of anti-subversion laws notwithstanding inconsistencies with specified fundamental liberties, did not cover inconsistencies with Article12. Also, the Court noted that adopting the objective test {{would be consistent with}} Article93 of the Constitution, which vests judicial power in the courts. It did not, however, directly address the argument by counsel that the subjective test, in conferring <b>arbitrary</b> powers of detention, would be inconsistent with Article93.|$|E

25|$|A logical {{system is}} decidable {{if there is}} an {{effective}} method for determining whether <b>arbitrary</b> formulas are theorems of the logical system. For example, propositional logic is decidable, because the truth-table method can be used to determine whether an <b>arbitrary</b> propositional formula is logically valid.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of Lebesgue measure λ on the real line R, {{consider}} an <b>arbitrary</b> point x∈R. Then any open neighbourhood N'x of x must contain some open interval (x'ε,x+ε) for some ε>0. This interval has Lebesgue measure 2ε>0, so λ(N'x)≥2ε>0. Since x∈R was <b>arbitrary,</b> supp(λ)=R.|$|E
25|$|Git version 2.6.1, {{released}} on 29 September 2015, contained a patch for a security vulnerability (CVE-2015-7545) which allowed <b>arbitrary</b> code execution. The vulnerability was exploitable if an attacker could convince a victim to clone a specific URL, as the <b>arbitrary</b> commands were {{embedded in the}} URL itself. An attacker could use the exploit via a man-in-the-middle attack if the connection was unencrypted, as they could redirect the user to a URL of their choice. Recursive clones were also vulnerable, since they allowed the controller of a repository to specify <b>arbitrary</b> URLs via the gitmodules file.|$|E

25|$|One way to {{identify}} locations of points in (or outside) a triangle {{is to place}} the triangle in an <b>arbitrary</b> location and orientation in the Cartesian plane, and to use Cartesian coordinates.
