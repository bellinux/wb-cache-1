5|$|During November 2002, New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research {{predicted}} {{that there would}} be an eastwards shift in activity during the season, with more tropical cyclones than normal expected to the east of the date line, due to well established weak to moderate El Niño conditions.

The Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu, Tonga, French Polynesia, New Zealand and the Northern Cook Islands were predicted to experience an <b>average</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> tropical cyclones, while Southern Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and New Caledonia were predicted to experience a reduced number of tropical cyclones. In January 2003, NIWA issued an updated outlook, listing the Northern Cook Islands and French Polynesia as areas predicted to experience an above <b>average</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> tropical cyclones. In contrast, Vanuatu was predicted to experience below average cyclone activity.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the <b>averaged</b> <b>number</b> ν <b>of</b> the lightest supersymmetric particles (LSPs) {{in a shower}} from the decay of superheavy particle X by generalized DGLAP equations. If the primary decayed particles have color charges and the virtuality is around 10 ^ 13 - 10 ^ 14 GeV, the <b>averaged</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the LSPs can become O(100). As the result, the upper limit {{of the mass of}} the superheavy particle, whose decay can produce the observed abundance of the dark matter, can increase from 10 ^ 12 GeV to 10 ^ 14 GeV. Since the typical scale of the inflaton mass of the chaotic inflation is around 10 ^ 13 GeV, the decay of the inflaton can produce the observed dark matter abundance if the reheating temperature is of order 1 GeV. Even for the standard model particles with virtuality Q∼ 10 - 100 TeV, the <b>averaged</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the LSPs becomes O(0. 1) for gluon, and O(0. 01) for Higgs, which strongly constrains the scenario of non-thermal LSP production from the decay of moduli with 10 - 100 TeV mass.

The relatedness among workers {{is also very}} low, {{and there is a}} high proportion of gamergate ants. If the gamergates are all unrelated, the number of gamergates living in a nest can reach as many as nine; all of these gamergates contribute to the reproduction of young. The <b>average</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> gamergates can still be very high if they are related and get a larger share in reproduction. Most of the time, however, gamergates are generally unrelated, and it is uncommon for them to have a degree of relatedness.
