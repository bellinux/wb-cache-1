50|$|Science in Motion New Castle Junior Senior High School took {{advantage}} of a state program called Science in Motion which brought college professors and sophisticated science equipment to the school to raise science awareness and to provide inquiry-based experiences for the students. The Science in Motion program is funded by an annual state <b>appropriation</b> <b>line</b> item and costs the District nothing to participate. George Washington Intermediate School and John F Kennedy Primary School also participated. The schools worked with Westminster College to provide the experiences.|$|E
60|$|The {{number of}} letters {{exchanged}} with foreign countries was 27,459,185, {{an increase of}} 3,096,685 over the previous year, and the postage thereon amounted to $2,021,310.86. The total weight of correspondence exchanged in the mails with European countries exceeded 912 tons, an increase of 92 tons over the previous year. The {{total cost of the}} United States ocean steamship service, including $725,000 paid from special <b>appropriations</b> to subsidized <b>lines</b> of mail steamers, was $1,047,271.35.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} objective is {{the analysis of}} the appropriation of space in urban public parks. For this purpose, extensive field observations were conducted in several parks in Zurich, Switzerland, over the span of three years, with records made of the location, assumed age, gender and activity of park visitors. Based on research in environmental psychology and anthropology, a model was developed building on the two concepts of «personal space» and «activity footprints» to represent space <b>appropriation.</b> In <b>line</b> with the view that quantitative spatial analysis methods remain a valid tool for critical, non-positivist research, the model was implemented using kernel density estimations for the spatio-temporal analysis of the observed park use. It is argued that the probability surfaces generated by kernel density estimations are an adequate representation of the specific vagueness of human space appropriation as they remain sensitive to the presence of individual park visitors...|$|R
5000|$|A sum of $5,000 was {{appropriated}} [...] "for {{the present}} year" [...] to purchase law books, with $1,000 {{for each of}} the next five years. The books would be selected by the Chief Justice. Some 2,011 law books (693 of which had belonged to Thomas Jefferson) were transferred from the general collection, and became the nucleus of a collection that now exceeds 2 million volumes. The Law Library thus acquired its own <b>appropriation</b> and budget <b>line,</b> as well as a statutory relationship with the Supreme Court that would endure until 1935.|$|R
5000|$|Part B of IDEA {{originally}} authorized Congress {{to contribute}} up to 40 {{percent of the}} national average per pupil expenditure for each special education student. 20 U.S.C. § 1411(a). Appropriations for special education have failed to implement that original authorization. A number of studies have sought to track the apparent disparity between the federal commitment to special education and the shortfall in funding. A 2003 study by SEEP, now the Center for Special Education Finance, determined that the per pupil expenditures for special education range from a low of $10,558 for students with specific learning disabilities to a high of $20,095 for students with multiple disabilities. [...] According to the SEEP study, expenditures for students with specific learning disabilities were 1.6 times the expenditure for a regular education student, whereas expenditures for students with multiple disabilities were 3.1 times higher. Most states, in turn, have failed to make up the gap in federal funding, and this in turn has created financial pressures on local school districts. This has led to periodic calls for bringing <b>appropriations</b> in <b>line</b> with the original authorization.|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{study of}} virtual {{language}} learning via real-time multimodal platforms, this article has a focus on usage in teleconferencing. In particular, {{the relationship between the}} structure of a particular platform (Lyceum) and the usage that is developed within it is examined. To do so, the author introduces the notion of affordance. Using four analytical dimensions derived from social semiotics, discourse, design, production and distribution of the artefact used for teleconferencing, the author presents examples of <b>appropriation,</b> some in <b>line</b> with the aims of the platform designers, others created by the users to counter what appear to be communicative failings of the platform...|$|R
