Such <b>anchors</b> can be broadly classified as gravity <b>anchors,</b> pile <b>anchors</b> and plate <b>anchors.</b> Plate <b>anchors</b> can be circular, square or strip in shape. The loading applied on plate <b>anchors</b> can be vertical, inclined or horizontal depending on the <b>anchor</b> orientation. In this study, various experimental, theoretical and numerical approaches for estimation of load capacity of horizontal and inclined plate <b>anchors</b> are reviewed.

30|$|Longitudinal spacing of <b>anchors</b> or <b>anchor</b> {{groups may}} have two effects {{depending}} on the distance between centerlines of <b>anchors.</b> For <b>anchors</b> that have a large longitudinal spacing, the strains in the sheet behind the first row of <b>anchors</b> dropped significantly. The second row of <b>anchors</b> did not contribute to force development in the FRP sheet until the debonding front had passed beyond the first row of <b>anchors.</b> At this point, the force in the sheet {{was developed by the}} first row of <b>anchors</b> and a combination of <b>anchor</b> and bond in the region surrounding the second row of <b>anchors.</b> The effect of <b>anchors</b> spaced widely apart in the longitudinal direction was to increase the ductility of the system without affecting the strength of the system significantly.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of minimum swing {{is related to}} non-extension. The main <b>anchor</b> point in a well constructed load-sharing <b>anchor</b> will neither extend nor swing {{in the event of}} an individual <b>anchor</b> failure.

40|$|Under {{contract}} to the Dutch Department of Public Works Civil Engineering Division, SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research carried out simulation {{studies on the}} development of H 4 -level safety barriers. These included steel and concrete designs for a wide STEP barrier. <b>Anchoring</b> of these constructions in concrete was always the starting point for research simulations. The steel STEP barrier also had to be capable of being used with asphalt. However, there was no useful information available about <b>anchoring</b> in asphalt. This was therefore the basis for this research involving a number of loading tests. Three types of <b>anchor</b> bolts were tested. Two of these, the so-called "VD" <b>anchor</b> and the "VD-I" <b>anchor,</b> were adhesive <b>anchors.</b> The third <b>anchor,</b> the so-called "Schweizer Riegel" (SR) <b>anchor,</b> was a mechanical one. The <b>anchors</b> consisted of M 24 studs with an 8. 8 quality rating. The placement depth was varied with the "VD" <b>anchors,</b> and a range of speeds and forces was tested with the "SR" <b>anchors</b> and the "VD-I" <b>anchors.</b> The most important conclusion from this research was that "SR" <b>anchoring</b> is a good option for <b>anchoring</b> in asphalt at H 4 level. The research simulations for the STEP barrier involved four <b>anchors,</b> each with four <b>anchor</b> bolts, that together could absorb 1600 kN of tensile force. Four "SR" <b>anchors,</b> with four bolts per <b>anchor,</b> were more than sufficient to absorb this force (maximum force 2768 kN). "VD" and "VD-I" <b>anchors</b> with the same configuration were unable to absorb sufficient force. (A...|$|R
