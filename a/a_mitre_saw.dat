This is a small mechanical device where the tile is placed, aligned and clamped on a platform; lightly [...] "scored" [...] with a cutting wheel and snapped in two with a handled slicer (blade similar to a paper cutter in appearance).For larger jobs an electric tile saw or wet saw is used; this saw is similar to <b>a</b> small <b>mitre</b> <b>saw</b> except that water is distributed on the saw blade to lessen the effects of heat and friction.|$|R

50|$|The crowns of the Austrian Empire and Imperial Russia {{incorporated}} <b>a</b> <b>mitre</b> {{of precious}} metal and jewels into their design.

Their empress consorts also received both <b>a</b> <b>mitre</b> and crown on their heads from a cardinal bishop at the same ceremony. The form of the Russian Imperial Crown dates back to the time of Peter the Great’s early attempts to westernise Russia and was probably inspired by the crowns worn by Habsburg emperors of the Holy Roman Empire and possibly also the Orthodox mitre.|$|R
