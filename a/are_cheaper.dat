5|$|A last {{group of}} sheep breeds {{is that of}} fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all. Hair sheep {{are similar to the}} early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair sheep <b>are</b> <b>cheaper</b> to keep, as they do not need shearing. Hair sheep are also more {{resistant}} to parasites and hot weather.|$|E

The same month, the Singapore government enlisted Airbus Group to help local maintenance, repair, and operations providers to stay competitive against neighbour countries like Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines which <b>are</b> <b>cheaper.</b> To improve productivity, Airbus Group launches, in October 2016, a testbed hangar where new technologies can be tested. Upon entering the hangar, cameras study the aircraft to detect damages.

5|$|Despite {{the modest}} {{popularity}} of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers. When optic fibers are used, the distinction {{must be made}} between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. Multimode fibers {{can be thought of}} as thicker optical fibers that <b>are</b> <b>cheaper</b> to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer long-distance performance.|$|E
5|$|Some users {{reported}} that 64 and 128GB iPhone 6 models had experienced performance issues, {{and that some}} 128GB iPhone 6 Plus models would, in rare cases, randomly crash and reboot. Business Korea {{reported that}} the issues were connected to the triple-layer cell NAND storage of the affected models. Triple-layer cells can store three bits of data per cell of flash, and <b>are</b> <b>cheaper</b> than dual-layer cell solutions, but {{at the cost of}} performance. It was reported that Apple had planned to switch the affected model lines back to multi-layer cell flash, and address the performance issues on existing devices in a future iOS update.|$|E

He knows it would <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> if a number of us ate at the same time, so as to use the same table. So it would.

25|$|Relative endowments of {{the factors}} of {{production}} (land, labor, and capital) determine a country's comparative advantage.
