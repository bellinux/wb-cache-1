50|$|When a ship is combat loaded, {{each item}} must be stored {{so it can}} be {{unloaded}} at a time and in a sequence that will most effectively support the planned activities ashore. Whenever possible, the loading scheme must also provide flexibility to accommodate changes in the tactical plan, and <b>to</b> allow <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>cargo</b> that is required to meet emergency calls for equipment or supplies.|$|R
50|$|The CTX-2500 is a small-sized {{explosives}} {{detection system}} that is half the length of earlier CTX models. The CTX 2500 utilizes a single rotating X-ray source to acquire positioning images and CT-slice images, thus achieving its smaller size. The CTX 2500 system is the first FAA-certified Explosives Detection System (EDS) mounted on a truck for easy mobility and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>cargo.</b> One of the units costs approximately US$700,000.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{protection}} afforded to war graves, {{companies such as}} Odyssey Marine Exploration have not hesitated to raid sunken vessels <b>to</b> gain <b>access</b> <b>to</b> their <b>cargo.</b>|$|R
50|$|Privatization {{was one of}} the {{alternatives}} for investments to return in railroads. The government of the PSDB gave the public rail lines <b>access</b> <b>to</b> transport <b>cargo.</b> However, most of the railroad companies were not interested in seeing a transport of passengers, as the service was nearly extinct.|$|R
50|$|A {{hatchback}} is a {{car body}} configuration with a rear door that swings upward <b>to</b> provide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a <b>cargo</b> area. Hatchbacks may feature fold-down second row seating, where the interior can be flexibly reconfigured to prioritize passenger vs. cargo volume. Hatchbacks may feature two- or three-box design.|$|R
50|$|Many {{buildings}} with flat roofs have hatches that provide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the roof; on ships, hatches—usually not flush, and never called trapdoors—provide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the deck. <b>Cargo</b> ships, including bulk carriers, have large hatches for <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the holds.|$|R
50|$|The JFK Expressway {{begins on}} the grounds of John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York City. The road has {{southbound}} ramps that provide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Terminals 1-2-3, Terminal 4, and Terminals 5-6-7 along with the parking areas to Terminals 4 and 5. The northbound direction has access from all these points. The northbound direction has an exit that provides <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the I-678 (Van Wyck Expressway) that also provides <b>access</b> <b>to</b> long-term parking, rental car returns, as well as return <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the terminals. There is also a southbound entrance from I-678. North of here, the road continues north as a four-lane freeway, with a southbound exit and northbound entrance to Terminal 8. In the area, the road passes under the AirTrain JFK people mover that serves the airport. The JFK Expressway passes under airport runways in a tunnel as a six-lane road and comes to an interchange with South Cargo Road, which provides <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>Cargo</b> Areas, Medical Building, Vetport, Airport Services, as well as a return route to the terminals.|$|R
5000|$|... {{deployed}} to the Persian Gulf in October 1994 {{and served as}} Flagship to Commander, Destroyer Squadron 50 conducted Maritime Interception Operations in boarding numerous suspect vessels resulting in the diversion and detention of three vessels.Under Operational Command of Commander Fifth Fleet, COMDESRON 50 was the Multi-National Interdiction Operations (MIO) Commander for an area in the Persian Gulf, {{referred to as the}} NAG patrol area, working in company with American, Canadian and other naval forces providing around the clock surveillance and enforcement of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. Many of the vessels to be boarded are smaller Indian Cargo dhows or Mandi kutches of approximately 250 - 500 tons. Though small in size, the cargo dhows presented many unique problems to the boarding parties, primarily limited <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>cargo</b> holds and more importantly, a distinct language barrier.|$|R
25|$|At the aft {{end of the}} {{fuselage}} <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the cabin is gained by large clamshell doors and drop down cargo ramp with inbuilt retractable support jacks. Doors in {{the fuselage}} also give <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>cargo</b> hold: two on the starboard side and three on the port side. Above the rear fuselage {{is a very large}} fin and rudder, with a moderately sized tailplane with dihedral fitted with end-plate fins (not fitted for the first flight).|$|R
50|$|A {{bow visor}} is {{a feature of}} some ships, in {{particular}} ferries and Roll-on/roll-off ships, that allows the bow to articulate up and down, providing <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>cargo</b> ramp and storage deck near the water line. In modern ferry design over the last 25 years, though, bow visors {{have given way to}} clam doors that act like a clamshell and are believed to be safer than bow visor doors.|$|R
40|$|A {{relationship}} of economic osmosis is noticed between an airline {{and the country}} whose flag it flies. Economic impact studies prepared by government organisations and airline managements usually point out the economic benefits of setting up a new airline or flying a new route. These benefits arise for the airline’s home base by way of greater connectivity with the world and include a number of tangibles such as growth in tourism, increase in retail revenue from transit passengers, <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>cargo</b> transport for importers and exporters, employment opportunities {{and a host of}} indirect benefits that the local populace can gain from exposure to other countries and cultures. One also notices two very important intangibles associated with an airline and the nation of origin- national pride and national security. This paper analyses the remarkable success story of mutual growth shared by Emirates, the airline and Dubai, the city, over the past twenty-five years and the opportunities that the success of this duo signifies for others in the region. <br /...|$|R

5000|$|The Volvo C70, its {{retractable}} hardtop {{manufactured by}} Webasto includes a global window switch that allows simultaneous raising or lowering of all windows, and a button to power-activate {{the raising of}} the folded top stack within the trunk <b>to</b> <b>access</b> <b>cargo</b> below.|$|R
50|$|Van {{conversions}} involve adding {{windows to}} the bodywork, and seating <b>to</b> the <b>cargo</b> area. Van conversion minibuses outwardly {{look the same}} shape as the parent van, and the driver and front passenger cabin remains unchanged, retaining the driver and passenger doors. <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> the former <b>cargo</b> area for passengers is through the standard van side sliding door, or the rear doors. These may be fitted with step equipment to make boarding easier. Optional extras to van converted minibuses can include {{the addition of a}} rollsign for transit work, and/or a full-height walk-in door, for passenger <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the former <b>cargo</b> area. For public transport use, this door may be an automatic concertina type. For other uses, this may be a simple plug style coach door. Depending on the relevant legislation, conversions may also involve wheelchair lifts and tachograph equipment. A van conversion with a passenger area in the front and a storage area in the back, behind a fixed bulkhead, is called a splitter bus.|$|R
50|$|The final truck type is {{produced}} by Utilimaster. These are also finished cabs that are larger vehicles that simply have a box attached to the back before painting. These tend to be large diesel trucks used by Budget and Old Dominion {{that are capable of}} hauling more or larger products than the other trucks produced. <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>cargo</b> area in these trucks is always possible through a rear door and sometimes through a side-access door if available. However, there is rarely, if ever, access available through the cab <b>to</b> the <b>cargo</b> area. These boxes are also generally produced with wood flooring and wood slats on the interior walls.|$|R
50|$|The Zeta Sedan, (also {{known as}} the Zeta Runabout) and Utility, were powered by a 324cc Villiers engine and were front wheel drive with {{independent}} rear trailing arms. The Sedan was not equipped with a rear hatch so <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>cargo</b> area required removal of the front seats, the ease of which was advertised as a positive feature. The chassis was steel, with a fibreglass body enclosing a large but sparse interior. Windows were perspex except for the front windscreen which was laminated glass. The doors were steel with sliding perspex windows.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cargo</b> traffic <b>to</b> the Port of Tampa (now {{known as}} the Port of Tampa Bay) is heavily {{recommended}} to use the [...] "Truck Only" [...] lanes of the Connector, as they safely channel truck <b>cargo</b> traffic <b>to</b> and from the Port without burdening Ybor City. <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>cargo</b> lanes are provided from both directions of I-4. The Port entry ramp disperses at 20th St, just south of Durham St, and likewise, trucks exiting the port can access either direction of I-4 via the slip ramp from 22nd St, just north of Durham St.|$|R

5|$|Once in orbit, Big G {{would have}} docked with space {{stations}} using an Apollo docking probe {{mounted on the}} rear of the cargo module, which was in turn mounted on {{the rear of the}} re-entry module. The re-entry module itself would have been enlarged to accommodate the larger crew, and the modifications made to the spacecraft for the MOL program would have been incorporated, including the hatch in the heat shield, which would have been used <b>to</b> provide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>cargo</b> module. In the event of a launch failure, the launch escape system developed for the Apollo spacecraft would have been used to propel the re-entry module clear of the rocket.|$|R
5000|$|The estate {{versions}} {{had some}} interesting features. All had split tailgates - the rear windscreen would wind {{down into the}} bottom part, which could then be folded down. On the one hand, this allowed the <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>cargo</b> compartment without opening the full tailgate. On the other, this meant that a rear window heater could never be installed in estates. Additionally, the 1500 GL version's cargo floor, which doubled as the cover for the spare wheel (stowed flat), could be removed and, thanks to four folding legs, converted into a picnic table! [...] A 1500 Familial version had two child seats (facing each other) in the cargo compartment, and a luggage rack on the roof.|$|R
50|$|The cargo {{terminal}} currently has {{a capacity to}} handle 100,000 tons of cargo a year and can in the future {{has the capacity to}} increase to two million tons. Located next to King Shaka International Airport there is direct airside <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>cargo</b> terminal. It is open 24 hours as is the on-site regulatory services such as customs. The {{cargo terminal}} connects Dube Trade Zones via overhead conveyor air-bridge allowing freight-forwarding community, logistics service providers, assemblers, distributors and manufacturers to based in that zone. The facility also boasts 1 500 m2 of open cold storage area and specialised temperature controlled storage. The cargo terminal has five main operators, Emirates Sky Cargo, SAA Cargo, Bid Air Cargo, SA Airlink and Africa Charter Airline. It also operates Dube AiRoad, that operates air-to-road and road-to-air <b>cargo</b> <b>to</b> clients in South and Southern Africa.|$|R
50|$|Behind the B-pillar is a two-piece glass hatch. The {{uppermost}} {{glass panel}} normally lies flush. When pivoted-up by an electric motor, {{it acts as}} a roof spoiler, which also vents air from the interior and increases rear passenger headroom. A photovoltaic solar cell in the panel helps to control interior temperature, as well as helping recharge the battery for powering accessories. The larger glass hatch panel has side-mounted hinges <b>to</b> provide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the Kabura’s <b>cargo</b> compartment.|$|R
5000|$|The Clubman {{features}} <b>access</b> <b>to</b> its <b>cargo</b> space via bi-parting rear doors, {{known as}} barn doors or splitdoors. Also, all Clubman models feature a single backwards opening side door <b>to</b> <b>access</b> the rear seats. It is marketed singlarly as the Clubdoor, and is always located on its {{right side of}} the body [...] - [...] irrespective of market. It is much smaller in comparison to the regular driver and passenger side doors. This in turn creates differences between right and left-hand driver markets. In right-hand markets, the steering wheel won't allow the driver's seat from folding as far forward as the passenger seat. This means that left-hand drive markets feature increased <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the rear seat. For right-hand drive markets, including the car's home market, the bi-parting door is located on the road side of the car, requiring rear passengers to exit into the road.|$|R
50|$|Four {{months later}} a second shooting, one block away, at the LDS Church Family History Library {{led to the}} Triad Center being evacuated. During that shooting, a truck with a {{suspicious}} note was found parked near the Triad Center, and fears arose that the shooter or a possible accomplice had planted a bomb in the truck. Later that afternoon, Salt Lake City Police Department detonated an explosive charge attached to the truck, gaining <b>access</b> <b>to</b> its <b>cargo.</b> Inside, two 55 gal drums, one empty and one containing gasoline, were found. It was later learned the truck driver and his cargo were {{not related to the}} shooting, and was it just a case of being {{in the wrong place at}} the wrong time.|$|R
50|$|<b>To</b> provide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>cargo</b> {{area from}} the front without having to {{disconnect}} all electrical, hydraulic and flight control connections (and also avoiding the lengthy recalibrations before each flight that reconnection entailed), the standard A300 cockpit was relocated down below the cargo-floor level. By relocating the cockpit in this manner, loading times were reportedly halved from those encountered using the Super Guppy, which had needed to disconnect and reconnect such systems. Another reason for faster loading times was {{the adoption of a}} roll-on/roll-off loading system, as well as the ability to unload the aircraft in winds of up to 40 knots. The qualities and improved capabilities of the Beluga resulted in the costs associated with transporting Airbus components dropping to only one-third of those achieved by the Super Guppy.|$|R
25|$|At 10:50a.m. on 18 April, the ROK Coast Guard began pumping in air {{to support}} {{possible}} air pockets. At the same time, divers entered the capsized ship's hull but only gained <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>cargo</b> deck. The divers' entrance was later labeled a 'failure' by the Central Disaster Countermeasure Headquarters. On 19 April, a Navy petty {{officer who was}} injured during rescue operations died. On 21 April, remotely operated underwater vehicles began {{to be used for}} operations. On 24 April, the CR2000 'Crabster' robot was sent to the rescue site. On 6 May, a diver working for Undine Marine Industries died during the search. This was followed by another diver's death on 30 May. On 17 July, a firefighting helicopter returning from rescue operations crashed near an apartment complex, killing all five officers aboard and injuring a high school student.|$|R
5000|$|The Fletcher is a {{conventional}} low-wing monoplane with tricycle undercarriage, side-by-side seating {{in front of}} the wing and hopper and pronounced dihedral on the outer wing panels.

40|$|This {{paper will}} review lessons learned for space {{transportation}} systems {{from the viewpoint}} of the NASA, Industry and academia Space Propulsion Synergy Team (SPST). The paper provides the basic idea and history of "lessons learned". Recommendations that are extremely relevant to NASA's future investments in research, program development and operations are"'provided. Lastly, a novel and useful approach to documenting lessons learned is recommended, so as to most effectively guide future NASA investments. Applying lessons learned can significantly improve <b>access</b> <b>to</b> space for <b>cargo</b> or people by focusing limited funds on the right areas and needs for improvement. Many NASA human space flight initiatives have faltered, been re-directed or been outright canceled since the birth of the Space Shuttle program.
