5|$|Despite {{no longer}} having {{the burden of}} his professorial and garden duties, by the late 1870s the burden of {{maintaining}} himself as the pillar of American botany prevented Gray from the progress he desired on Synoptical Flora of North America, the follow-on to Flora of North America. This burden consisted {{of the fact that}} other scientists often only accepted Gray's word on a botanical matter, and the number of incoming specimens to identify was increasing vastly: numbers had to be assigned to them, collectors needed to be corresponded with, and preliminary papers had to be published. By the early 1880s, Gray's home was the center of everything to do with botany in America. Every aspiring botanist came to see him, even if just to look <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> his window.|$|E
5|$|The three wake {{up again}} on the TARDIS, no longer in any danger. The Doctor realises both realities were false since the Dream Lord had no power over {{the real world and}} was a manifestation of his darker side. The three were {{influenced}} by psychic pollen that had fallen in the TARDIS time rotor and heated up, creating the Dream Lord and the false realities. Rory comes to realise that Amy killed herself in the Leadworth reality out of love for him, and the two confess their love for each other. The Doctor sees the Dream Lord smile <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> his reflection.|$|E
5|$|Once in Nightopia, they {{discover}} and release Nights, who tells them about dreams and Wizeman and his plans; the three begin {{a journey to}} stop Wizeman and restore peace to Nightopia. When they defeat Wizeman and Reala, peace is returned to Nightopia {{and the world of}} Nightmare is suppressed. The next day, back in Twin Seeds, a centenary ceremony begins. Elliot is seen walking through the parade until he has a vision of Nights looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> a billboard. Realizing that Claris is performing in a hall, Elliot runs through the crowd and sees Claris on stage in front of a large audience, singing well. The two look at each other, and are transitioned to a spring valley in Nightopia, which leaves ambiguity as to whether what they achieved was real or just a dream.|$|E

60|$|Frink looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> doubtfully, <b>through</b> all {{the service}} kept glancing <b>at</b> <b>him</b> doubtfully, till Babbitt was nervous.|$|R

25|$|Boggs, who {{was from}} Independence, {{moved to a}} house within the City of Zion plot in Independence after the Mormons were evicted from Missouri and after he left office. His home was three blocks east of Temple Lot. On the rainy evening of May 6, 1842, Boggs was shot by an unknown party who fired <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> a window as he read a {{newspaper}} in his study. Boggs was hit by large buckshot in four places: two balls were lodged in his skull, another lodged in his neck, and a fourth entered his throat, whereupon Boggs swallowed it. Boggs was severely injured. Several doctors—Boggs' brother among them—pronounced Boggs as good as dead; at least one newspaper ran an obituary. To everyone's great surprise, Boggs not only survived, but gradually improved.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{it is well}} {{established}} that Caspar had been niggling Coleman since the very start of the match, which included making persistent and heavy contact with a nasty boil on Coleman's neck; and that Caspar had punched Coleman twice whilst play was {{at the other end}} of the ground, immediately before Coleman retaliated; and that, apart from his reaction to Caspar's thuggery, Coleman had not been proactive in any way. The match to that time had been a somewhat brutal encounter, and the crowd was highly agitated. During the match bottles were thrown at Coleman, and as he came off the ground at half-time, and walked up the players race, a Carlton fan spat <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> gaps in the cyclone wired barriers that separated the spectators from the players. Coleman snapped, and smashed the fan in the face, badly hurting his hand. He went into the Essendon rooms, shouting with rage at the total absence of any protection from the match officials, took off his jumper, and spoke of not returning to the field.|$|E
500|$|Frank Sinatra {{stopped his}} car. The light was red. Pedestrians passed quickly across his {{windshield}} but, as usual, one did not. It {{was a girl}} in her twenties. She remained at the curb staring <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>Through</b> {{the corner of his}} left eye he could see her, and he knew, because it happens almost every day, that she was thinking, It looks like him, but is it? ...|$|E
60|$|She {{glanced up}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> shyly <b>through</b> wet lashes--as peeps the sun through April clouds.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{the fact}} is they're {{advertising}} for a shop-walker tomorrow," [...] said Athelny, looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> doubtfully <b>through</b> his glasses.|$|R
60|$|Madame scanned {{him with}} interest. The fastidious Marius eyed him with disgust. The Seneschal peered <b>at</b> <b>him</b> curiously <b>through</b> {{shortsighted}} eyes.|$|R
500|$|Tyndall also {{launched}} a new magazine, which he titled Spearhead, and a publishing company called Albion Press. According to the historian Alan Sykes, this magazine became [...] "increasingly influential" [...] in the British far-right. Much of the material that Tyndall {{wrote for the journal}} was less openly Neo-Nazi and extreme than his previous writings, something which may have resulted from caution surrounding the Race Relations Act 1965. The GBM engaged in several stunts to raise publicity; in 1964 for instance Webster assaulted the Kenyan leader Jomo Kenyatta outside his London hotel while Tyndall hurled insults <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> a loudspeaker. In 1965, the group staged a shooting incident at its Norwood headquarters, claiming that it had been an attack by anti-fascists. In another instance they distributed stickers emblazoned with a portrait of Hitler and the slogan [...] "he was right". In 1966, several GBM members were arrested for carrying out arson attacks against synagogues.|$|E
2500|$|... 18 April 1992: Brendan McWilliams, an {{employee}} of the British Army, was shot dead by the IRA at his home, Nialls Crescent, off Killylea Road, Armagh. At least 18 shots were fired <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> the front door from a high velocity weapon.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of June 20, 1947, as Siegel sat with his {{associate}} Allen Smiley in Virginia Hill's Beverly Hills home reading the Los Angeles Times, an assailant fired <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> the window with a [...]30 caliber military M1 carbine, hitting him many times, including twice in the head. No one was charged with the murder, and the crime remains officially unsolved.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Dunstable, no." [...] Mr. Day peered <b>at</b> <b>him</b> gravely <b>through</b> his spectacles. [...] "I set you no imposition; but Mr. Langridge did." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. H. He's {{been waiting}} for me to look <b>at</b> <b>him</b> all <b>through</b> dinner. Shall I do it, and you can see what an idiot he looks? ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{pitched the}} motive low, to absolve him from unmanliness, {{and was a}} little disconcerted when his father looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> right <b>through,</b> heaved an {{important}} sigh, and answered: ...|$|R
2500|$|Rowling {{revealed}} in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince that young Merope Gaunt made {{efforts to get}} as close to Tom as she could, peering <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> the windows and bushes at every opportunity. Morfin noticed his sister's affection for Tom, and hexed him as he rode by, covering him in hives. This breach of wizarding law, and the ensuing violent struggle with Ministry of Magic officials, led to Marvolo and Morfin being imprisoned in Azkaban. As surmised by Dumbledore, once Merope was alone and no longer dominated by her father, she could make her move for Tom. She offered Tom a drink laced with a love potion as he rode by one day without his attractive companion, Cecilia. He became infatuated with Merope and they eloped. Within {{three months of the}} marriage, Merope became pregnant. Merope decided to stop giving Tom the love potion, having come to the belief such enchantment of a man was tantamount to slavery. She also revealed her witch status to Tom, believing either that he {{had fallen in love with}} her on his own or he would at least stay for their unborn child. She was wrong, and Tom quickly left his pregnant wife and went home to his parents, claiming to have been [...] "hoodwinked" [...] and tricked into marrying Merope. Tom Marvolo Riddle, their son, was born on 31 December 1926 and was left to grow up in an orphanage, as Merope had died soon after giving birth.|$|E
60|$|She sighed, {{and looked}} up <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> a little cloud of tobacco smoke.|$|E
60|$|Psmith looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> his eye-glass, {{and helped}} himself to {{another piece of}} toast.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> wet <b>through</b> {{and almost}} blue with cold, {{and at the}} dull cheerless-looking cottage. Again the woman in her triumphed, and {{her eyes filled with}} tears.|$|R
60|$|Nedda, returning, {{found her}} {{supporting}} {{his head with}} one hand, while with the other she kept popping in the spoon, her soul smiling <b>at</b> <b>him</b> lovingly <b>through</b> her lips and eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never see}} him," [...] Davidson had {{to confess to}} his owner, who would peer <b>at</b> <b>him</b> silently <b>through</b> round, horn-rimmed spectacles, several sizes too large for his little old face. [...] "I never see him." ...|$|R
60|$|She said {{farewell}} to George, and looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> a quiver of suppressed tears.|$|E
60|$|She laughed <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> the darkness, and at {{the sound}} of her laugh his eyes glowed.|$|E
60|$|His {{father told}} him that story: his father looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> a glass: he had a hairy face.|$|E
60|$|She put {{her head}} back and looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> sideways, {{laughing}} <b>through</b> the glitter of her hair.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he heard}} voices, and saw faces looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as <b>through</b> a mist, also he felt {{something}} {{in his mouth and}} throat, which seemed to burn them. One of the voices, it was that of the guide, said: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{first person}} I saw there was Mr. Shelmardine. He was sitting right {{across from me}} and a smile glimmered in his eyes. I did not look <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again. <b>Through</b> the service I was subdued enough to have {{satisfied}} even Aunt Martha.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mercy is accomplished. And accomplishments {{have their}} charm," [...] {{returned}} his mother, looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> her silver spectacles.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> {{and through}} a moment longer. Then, seeming {{satisfied}} with her scrutiny, {{she picked up her}} pail.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Our situation, Mr. Tottle,’ resumed the lady, glancing <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>through</b> {{one of the}} eyelet-holes, ‘is a most {{peculiar}} {{and delicate}} one.’ ...|$|E
60|$|Matthew laughed very insolently. Martin threw {{a strange}} look <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and trembled <b>through</b> all his slight lad's frame; but he {{restrained}} himself.|$|R
60|$|This fine officer {{touched his}} laced hat most courteously to our Captain, who, after {{returning}} the compliment, stared <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> rather impolitely, <b>through</b> his spy-glass.|$|R
60|$|It was on {{that night}} that Grandemont first {{perceived}} a new and singular expression in Adèle's eyes whenever she looked <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> And <b>through</b> the years following that expression was always there. He could not read it, for it was born of a thought she would never otherwise reveal.|$|R
