5|$|Norfolk has a {{long history}} of human occupation. Both Modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area before the last {{glaciation}} between 100,000 and 10,000years ago, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the prevailing conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic, the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>under</b> the sea. The oldest signs of habitation on the marshes are prehistoric Clactonian flint blades possibly from 400,000 years ago, but few other prehistoric remains have been recorded here.|$|E
