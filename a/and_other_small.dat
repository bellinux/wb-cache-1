5|$|Bushshrikes {{are similar}} in habits to shrikes, hunting insects <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> prey from a perch on a bush. Although similar in build to the shrikes, these tend to be either {{colourful}} species or largely black; some species are quite secretive.|$|E
5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as hunting dogs, {{their goal is}} to find the bird, send it into the air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.|$|E
5|$|Cultured mysids {{are thought}} to provide an ideal food source for many marine organisms. They are often fed to cephalopods, fish larvae, and {{commercial}} farmed shrimp due to their small size and low cost. Their high protein and fat content also makes them a good alternative to live enriched Artemia when feeding juveniles (especially those {{that are difficult to}} maintain such as young seahorses) <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> fauna.|$|E

5|$|During {{the day the}} crossback stingaree {{is usually}} {{inactive}} {{and can be found}} partially or completely buried in sand on the sea floor. It is a carnivore and adults forage for crustaceans, polychaete worms <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> invertebrates on the seafloor. Juveniles feed on smaller crustaceans such as isopods, amphipods and shrimps.|$|E
5|$|Forest cobras {{will feed}} {{on a wide}} variety of prey, {{including}} amphibians, fish, other snakes, monitor lizards and other lizards, bird eggs, rodents, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> mammals.

5|$|From its {{headwaters}} in the Coast Mountains, the Yukon River flows northwest, {{across the}} Yukon–Alaska border, until it intersects the Porcupine River at {{the settlement of}} Fort Yukon. At that point, the river turns west and southwest, flowing through the Yukon Flats, a low-lying wetland area containing thousands of ponds, streams, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> bodies of water. As the river flows southwest, it intersects the Tanana and Koyukuk rivers before looping south, then north into Norton Sound in the Bering Sea.|$|E

5|$|In 1831, {{the first}} gold dollar was minted, at the private mint of Christopher Bechtler in North Carolina. Much {{of the gold}} then being {{produced}} in the United States came from the mountains of North Carolina and Georgia, and the dollars <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> gold coins issued by Bechtler circulated through that region, and were now and then seen further away. Additional one-dollar pieces were struck by August Bechtler, Christopher's son.|$|E

5|$|In {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} environments, gastrotrichs {{form part of}} the benthic community. They are detritivores and are microphagous, sucking dead or living organic material, diatoms, bacteria and small protozoa into their mouths by the muscular action of the pharynx.

5|$|Most {{species are}} generalist predators, eating microalgae, sponges, bivalves, snails <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> animals. The crown-of-thorns starfish consumes coral polyps, while other species are detritivores, feeding on decomposing organic {{material}} and faecal matter. A few are suspension feeders, gathering in phytoplankton; Henricia and Echinaster often occur {{in association with}} sponges, benefiting from the water current they produce. Various species {{have been shown to}} be able to absorb organic nutrients from the surrounding water, and this may form a significant portion of their diet.|$|E
5|$|Pennies <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> coins are {{sometimes}} ingested by dogs, requiring veterinary {{removal of the}} foreign objects. The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms. Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal. The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow mostly eats seeds, {{foraging}} {{in trees}} {{and on the}} ground. The larger seeds of cereals, wild grasses, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> plants are preferred, with wheat and khakiweed (Alternanthera caracasana) being favourites. Buds and soft fruits are also taken, causing considerable damage to agriculture. Insects are eaten, and nestlings seem to be fed exclusively on caterpillars. The Cape sparrow eats the soft shoots of plants, and probes in aloes for nectar, {{but these are not}} important sources of food.|$|E

5|$|The {{domestic}} cat is {{a significant}} predator of birds. UK assessments indicate they may be accountable for an estimated 64.8million bird deaths each year. A 2012 study suggests feral cats may kill several billion birds {{each year in the}} United States. Certain species appear more susceptible than others; for example, 30% of house sparrow mortality is linked to the domestic cat. In the recovery of ringed robins (Erithacus rubecula) and dunnocks (Prunella modularis), 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation. In parts of North America, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> predators reduces the effect of predation by cats <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety. The proposal that cat populations will increase when the numbers of these top predators decline is called the mesopredator release hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} {{and evolution of}} the Solar System began 4.6billion {{years ago with the}} gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud. Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> Solar System bodies formed.|$|E
5|$|Andreacarus voalavo {{was named}} in 2007 by Ashley Dowling, Andre Bochkov, and Barry OConnor {{on the basis}} of 15specimens found on an {{individual}} of the rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus that was collected in 1994 in the Anjanaharibe-Sud Reserve in northern Madagascar. The specific name, voalavo, is taken from the generic name of the type host. Voalavo gymnocaudus, the only known host, is only found in the Anjanaharibe-Sud and Marojejy massifs of the Malagasy Northern Highlands. A.voalavo is closely related to Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus, found on other Malagasy rodents. They are members of the genus Andreacarus, which currently includes 11 species found on rodents <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> mammals in Madagascar and mainland Africa.|$|E

5|$|Blackcaps <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> {{birds are}} {{illegally}} trapped and hunted {{in large numbers}} in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Malta, Libya, Egypt and Cyprus, where they are considered as a delicacy. Despite hunting and natural hazards, the European population of the blackcap has been rising for several decades as the range extends northwards, for example to Scotland and Denmark. There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range, such as in northern Israel and the Faroes, and wandering birds may appear further afield in Iceland or on the islands of Arctic Russia. In the Baltic, {{the spread of the}} blackcap appears to have been helped by the availability of territories formerly occupied by the declining barred warbler.|$|E
5|$|Bog turtles are {{omnivorous}} and eat {{aquatic plants}} (such as duckweed), seeds, berries, earthworms, snails, slugs, insects, other invertebrates, frogs, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> vertebrates. They also occasionally eat carrion. Invertebrates such as insects are generally {{the most important}} food item. In captivity, a bog turtle can be fed a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as meat such as liver, chicken hearts, and tinned dog food. Bog turtles feed only during the day, but rarely during the hottest hours, consuming their food on land or in the water.|$|E
5|$|By Your Side was {{released}} on January12, 1999. The album's cover art is a blue-tinted nighttime photograph of the band, all dressed in white and {{standing in front of}} a lake. The band name is rendered in tiny white lights above their heads, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>small</b> white lights are scattered at their feet. In keeping with the tiny lights theme, the back of the booklet shows a satellite image of the United States at night, in which densely populated areas can be discerned by light pollution, and the booklet contains drawings of constellations.
