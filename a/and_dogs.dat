5|$|The Amami rabbit {{also faces}} huge threats from the {{invasive}} predators, being {{a major cause}} for the decline in population size.

5|$|All species {{within the}} wolf-like canids possess 78 {{chromosomes}} {{and therefore can}} potentially interbreed. Genetic analysis reveals that hybridization takes place between gray wolves and jackals, creating a jackal-wolf hybrid. Hybridization also occurs between female golden jackals and male dogs, which produces fertile offspring, a jackal–dog hybrid. There was 11%–13% of ancient gene flow into the golden jackal from the population that was ancestral to wolves <b>and</b> <b>dogs,</b> and an additional 3% contributed from extant wolf populations. Up to 15% of the Israeli wolf genome is derived from admixure with golden jackals in ancient times.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{probably}} safest when out at sea. Here, the dangers are often from below the water rather than above, and puffins {{can sometimes be}} seen putting their heads underwater to peer around for predators. Seals {{have been known to}} kill puffins and large fish may also do so. Most puffin colonies are on small islands, and this is no coincidence as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats and weasels, cats <b>and</b> <b>dogs.</b> When they come ashore, the birds are still at risk and the main threats come from the sky.|$|E

In this work we investigated the interaction of a specific peptide, referred to as SIT 2, on the C-terminal of DGAT 1 (HKWCIRHFYKP) with model membranes made with OCoA <b>and</b> <b>DOG</b> in Langmuir monolayers and liposomes. According to the circular dichroism and fluorescence data, conformational changes on SIT 2 were seen only on liposomes containing OCoA <b>and</b> <b>DOG.</b> In Langmuir monolayers, SIT 2 causes the isotherms of neat OCoA <b>and</b> <b>DOG</b> monolayers to be expanded, but has negligible effect on mixed monolayers of OCoA <b>and</b> <b>DOG.</b> This synergistic interaction between SIT 2 <b>and</b> <b>DOG</b> + OCoA may be rationalized {{in terms of a}} molecular model in which SIT 2 may serve as a linkage between the two lipids.

Mackintosh, who believed that Shackleton might attempt to cross the continent in that first season, insisted that sledging work should begin without delay, with a view to laying down supply depots at 79° and 80°S. Joyce opposed this; more time, he maintained, should be set aside to acclimatise and train men <b>and</b> <b>dogs.</b> However he was overruled by Mackintosh, who was unaware that Shackleton had ruled out a crossing that season.|$|E
5|$|Because adult great spotted kiwis {{are large}} and powerful, {{they are able to}} fend off most predators that attack them, such as stoats, ferrets, weasels, pigs, brush possums and cats, all of which are {{invasive}} species in New Zealand. However, dogs are able to kill even adults. Stoats, ferrets, possums, cats <b>and</b> <b>dogs</b> will feed on the eggs and chicks, meaning most chicks die within their first five months of life. Before the arrival of mammalian predators, the great spotted kiwi's natural predators would have been birds of prey like the extinct Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier and the extant Swamp harrier.|$|E
