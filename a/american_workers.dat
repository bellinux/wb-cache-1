While in France, Blaine {{wrote a letter to the}} New-York Tribune criticizing Cleveland’s plans to reduce the tariff, saying that free trade with Europe would {{impoverish}} <b>American</b> <b>workers</b> and farmers. The family returned to the United States in August 1887. His letter in the Tribune had raised his political profile even higher, and by 1888 Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge, both former opponents, urged Blaine to run against Cleveland again. Opinion within the party was overwhelmingly in favor of renominating Blaine.|$|E

Delta Air Lines added more flights from Virginia to Florida in anticipation. To entice more fans to attend, tourism officials planned to step up their advertising in order to boost the economic impact of the event, estimated in 2009 at $200million. The advertising campaign was a difficult sell because the game was scheduled for the first Monday after New Year's Day, the date when most <b>American</b> <b>workers</b> return to their jobs after the New Year.|$|E

5|$|The United States is {{the only}} {{advanced}} economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation {{and is one of}} just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia. While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations. 74% of full-time <b>American</b> <b>workers</b> get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits. In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Chambly {{improved}} morale {{in the ranks}} of Montgomery's army, so much so that he went through with his plan to establish a battery north of Fort St. Jean, this time without opposition. While the Americans were constructing the batteries, the British heavily bombarded the <b>American</b> <b>workers,</b> but this resulted in few casualties. General Guy Carleton, commanding the British forces at Montreal, realized that the situation at Fort St. Jean was becoming desperate.

25|$|There is also {{evidence}} of a relationship between wages and perceived race. Jeffrey Grogger conducted a study in which listeners were to categorize English-speakers based upon race; listeners would then give opinions regarding the speakers’ level of education, region of origin, and native language. Listeners could correctly perceive race, but not level of education. Furthermore, there was a correlation between the perceived race of the speaker and the speaker’s total earnings: African <b>American</b> <b>workers</b> who could be identified as black in the study based upon speech earned 12% less than African <b>American</b> <b>workers</b> who were not identified as black; those African <b>American</b> <b>workers</b> {{that could not be}} identified by phonetic cues earned as much white workers.|$|E

50|$|Bernstein earned {{critical}} {{praise for}} the first two books of A History of the <b>American</b> <b>Worker,</b> a trilogy about the American labor movement in the interwar period. The Lean Years: A History of the <b>American</b> <b>Worker,</b> 1920-1933 focuses on the decline of the American labor movement following World War I. A decade later, he published The Turbulent Years: A History of the <b>American</b> <b>Worker,</b> 1933-1941, in which he described American unions' growth under the New Deal. In both books, Bernstein argued that the New Deal and labor unions preserved democracy and capitalism {{at a time when the}} survival of both was unclear, and that New Deal labor policy dramatically reoriented public policy away from employers toward workers.|$|R
