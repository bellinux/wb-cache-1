5|$|According to Karl James, no {{detailed}} {{orders were}} produced {{for the attack}} and deliberate planning was hastily completed {{with little or no}} co-ordination between the attacking infantry regiments. In addition, to increase the size of the infantry force, troops from the field artillery regiment were quickly re-roled as riflemen. In the meantime, the Australians on Slater's Knoll, having been alerted to the possibility of a large-scale attack began adjusting their defences. The soldiers cleared fields off fire and set out clear engagement areas to the north, northwest <b>and</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knoll, to allow maximum effectiveness of their supporting Vickers medium machine guns and Bren light machine guns. Barbed wire was laid out, and booby traps set.|$|E
5|$|Although St. Lucia {{suffered}} {{significant damage}} to its residential structures and agricultural land, its airports and hotels were operational within days having needed only small-scale repair work. Hospitals and other essential services kept running on standby power supplied by independent generators {{to assist in}} the cleanup and recovery efforts. Roads connecting the north <b>and</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island were quickly cleared. LUCELEC, the nation's only electricity provider, worked around the clock to repair dozens of downed electrical poles and restored electricity by August 21. The rest of the island's infrastructure weathered the storm. Two shelters were opened for hurricane-affected residence, and USAID/OFDA provided US$40,432 of assistance to the island.|$|E
5|$|As Finland was {{negotiating}} with the Soviet Union for peace, the Oberkommando des Heeres {{paid attention to the}} Narva front, using every means to convince the Finnish Defence Command that their defence was going to hold. The German command informed their Finnish colleagues in detail about the events on the Narva front while a delegation of the Finnish Defence Command visited Narva in spring 1944. Besides being a narrow corridor well suited for defence, the terrain in the area of Narva was dominated by forests and swamps. Directly behind the Narva River lay the city itself, ideally positioned as a bastion from which defending forces could influence combat to both the north <b>and</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city along the river valley.|$|E

5|$|As the Anzac Mounted Division {{approached}} Um Zughla at 02:00 on 21 December, a halt {{was called}} until 03:30 when the column continued on to El Arish.

One prisoner was captured, while lines of observation were set up, which maintained a close watch over the country east <b>and</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town. By 16:00 the 1st and 3rd Light Horse, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and the Imperial Camel Brigades were in bivouac at El Arish, the only casualties during the day being {{two members of the}} 1st Light Horse Brigade, who were blown up by a stranded mine on the beach.|$|E
5|$|Beovoz is the suburban/commuter {{railway network}} that {{provides}} mass-transit {{services in the}} city, similar to Paris' RER and Toronto's GO Transit.

It began operation in 1992 and currently has 5 lines with 41 stations divided in two zones.|$|E
5|$|By Sunday afternoon, 18hours {{after the}} alarm {{was raised in}} Pudding Lane, the fire had become a raging {{firestorm}} that created its own weather. A tremendous uprush of hot air above the flames was driven by the chimney effect wherever constrictions narrowed the air current, such as the constricted space between jettied buildings, and this left a vacuum at ground level. The resulting strong inward winds did not tend to put the fire out, as might be thought; instead, they supplied fresh oxygen to the flames, and the turbulence created by the uprush made the wind veer erratically both north <b>and</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main easterly direction of the gale which was still blowing.|$|E

These {{include the}} Musée des Beaux-Arts et de la Dentelle de Calais, Cité internationale de la Dentelle et de la Mode de Calais and the Musée de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale (World War II museum). Cité internationale de la Dentelle et de la Mode de Calais is a lace and fashion museum {{located in an}} old Boulart factory on the canalside and contains workshops, a library and a restaurant and regularly puts on fashion shows. The World War II museum is located at Parc St Pierre opposite the town hall <b>and</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train station. The building is a former Nazi bunker and wartime military headquarters, built in 1941 by the Todt Organisation.

5|$|From 1972 through 1974, {{the war was}} {{conducted}} along FANK's lines of communications north <b>and</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital. Limited offensives were launched to maintain contact with the rice-growing regions of the northwest and along the Mekong River and Route 5, the Republic's overland connections to South Vietnam. The strategy of the Khmer Rouge was to gradually cut those lines of communication and squeeze Phnom Penh. As a result, FANK forces became fragmented, isolated, and unable to lend one another mutual support.|$|E
5|$|From {{a base of}} {{territory}} in eastern Scotland north of the River Forth <b>and</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River Oykel, the kingdom acquired control of the lands lying {{to the north and}} south. By the 12th century, the kings of Alba had added to their territories the English-speaking land in the south-east and attained overlordship of Gaelic-speaking Galloway and Norse-speaking Caithness; {{by the end of the}} 13th century, the kingdom had assumed approximately its modern borders. However, processes of cultural and economic change beginning in the 12th century ensured Scotland looked very different in the later Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the 9thcentury the Pechenegs {{controlled}} the territories to the east <b>and</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Carpathians. According to the Eymund's saga, they fought together with the Blökkumen ("Romanians") in the Kievan Rus' in the 1010s. The Pechenegs were swept aside from their territories by the Cumans between 1064 and 1078. A late variant of the oldest Turkish chronicle, the Oghuz-name relates that the Cumans defeated many nations, including the Ulâq ("Romanians"). Some of the Pechenegs fled into the Kingdom of Hungary where they were employed to guard the border districts, for instance in Transylvania.|$|E
