40|$|A {{research}} was conducted to study the factors affecting the <b>alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> rate of passengers and establish a prediction model for <b>alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> time of passengers for a passenger rail service in Malaysia. Data was collected at the KL Sentral LRT station during the morning and evening peak hours {{for a period of}} 5 working days. Results show that passenger behaviour, passenger volume, crowdedness in train and mixture of flow has significant effects on the <b>alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> time though mixture of flow is not significant in the prediction model produced due to the passenger behaviour at the platform...|$|R
40|$|The ride of {{the tram}} along the line, {{defined by a}} time-table, {{consists}} of the travel time between the subsequent sections and the time spent by tram on the stops. In the paper, statistical data collected {{in the city of}} Krakow is presented and evaluated. In polish conditions, for trams the time spent on stops makes up the remarkable amount of 30 % of the total time of tram line operation. Moreover, this time is characterized by large variability. The time spent by tram on a stop consists of <b>alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> time and time lost by tram on stop after <b>alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> time ending, but before departure. <b>Alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> time itself usually depends on the random number of <b>alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> passengers and also on the number of passengers which are inside the vehicle. However, the time spent by tram on stop after <b>alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> time ending is an effect of certain random events, mainly because of impossibility of departure from stop, caused by lack of priorities for public transport vehicles. The main focus of the talk lies on the description and the modelling of these effects. This paper is involved with CIVITAS-CARAVEL project: "Clean and better transport in cites".

40|$|From passenger’s perspective, {{punctuality}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important features of tram route operation. We present a stochastic simulation model with special focus on determining important factors of influence. The statistical analysis bases on large samples (sample size is nearly 2000) accumulated from comprehensive measurements on eight tram routes in Cracow. For the simulation, we are not only interested in average values but also in stochastic characteristics like the variance and other properties of the distribution. A realization of trams operations is assumed to be a sequence of running times between successive stops and times spent by tram at the stops divided in passengers <b>alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> times and times waiting for possibility of departure. The running time depends on the kind of track separation including the priorities in traffic lights, the length of the section and the number of intersections. For every type of section, a linear mixed regression model describes the average running time and its variance as functions of the length of the section and the number of intersections. The regression coefficients are estimated by the iterative re-weighted least square method. <b>Alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> time mainly depends on type of vehicle, number of passengers <b>alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> and occupancy of vehicle. For the distribution of the time waiting for possibility of departure suitable distributions like Gamma distribution and Lognormal distribution are fitted...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the nature}} of rail transit dwell time has {{potential}} benefits for both the users and the operators. Crowded passenger trains cause longer dwell times and may prevent some passengers from boarding the first avail-able train that arrives. Actual dwell time {{and the process of}} passenger <b>alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> are interdependent through the sequence of train stops and propagated delays. A comprehensive and feasible dwell time simulation model was developed and optimized to address the problems asso-ciated with scheduled timetables. The paper introduces the factors that affect dwell time in urban rail transit systems, including train headway, the process and number of pas-sengers <b>alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> the train, and the inability of train doors to properly close the first time because of over-crowded vehicles. Finally, based on a time-driven micro-sim-ulation system, Shanghai rail transit Line 8 is used as an ex-ample to quantify the feasibility of scheduled dwell times for different stations, directions of travel and time periods, and a proposed dwell time during peak hours in several crowded stations is presented according to the simulation results.

40|$|The {{problems}} such as design of a metro station, {{an analysis of the}} station or line performance characteristics, simulation of passenger <b>alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> process, simulation of metro line operation, etc. involve the need to get much better knowledge about the behavior of the passengers on the station platform in terms of their distribution among train doors in relation with the station design elements. Despite this, there have been only very limited number of researchers that tackled this problem. In this article, a model of passenger distribution among metro train doors has been developed. The model has been based on the data collected from the Bloor metro station in Toronto, Canada. Metro trains were video-taped during two-hour study period and data were obtained for the number of <b>alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> passengers per each door and per each train. The results of the statistical analysis have shown that multinomial probability distribution appears to be a good model to describe passenger <b>boarding</b> and <b>alighting</b> process. It also has been shown that there has been clear dependence of the passenger distribution among train doors on the position of the platform entrance and exit points...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSeveral factors {{influence}} bus transit reliability {{which includes}} bus stop conditions along the route, traffic conditions, route {{of travel and}} time of day. The overall transit bus reliability is generally affected by dwell time (DT), the fare payment method, the bus stop location, {{and the number of}} passengers <b>alighting</b> or <b>boarding.</b> A new variable is defined in this study, total bus stop time (TBST), which is the summation of DT and the time it takes a bus to effectively park at a bus stop and the re-entering the traffic stream. It is suggested that the overall bus transit reliability along routes could be improved if the TBST is minimized at bus stops. In this study, TBST models for bus stops located at mid-blocks and near intersections were developed based on multivariate regression analysis using ordinary least squares method. Data collection was conducted at 60 bus stops, 30 of which were near intersections and 30 at mid-blocks, in Washington DC during morning, mid-day and evening peak hours. The variables observed at each bus stop are as follows: number of passengers <b>alighting</b> or <b>boarding,</b> DT, TBST, bus stop type, bus pad, length number of lanes on approach to the bus stop, and permitted parking. Statistical inferences were based on 5 % level of significance. From the results, it was inferred that the new variable, TBST, could potentially be used to improve scheduling and transit bus systems planning in a dense urban area...|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} a request stop for trains running from Shrewsbury to Swansea. Those wishing to <b>alight</b> or <b>board</b> the train here must alert the driver/conductor of the train. However, {{passenger}} trains running from Swansea to Shrewsbury stop here mandatorily, {{as the train}} has to stop before the level crossing. For trains from the Swansea direction, the level crossing is activated by the traincrew using a cabinet on the platform. From 1977 to 2014, the level crossing was ungated, but following a number of near-misses (such as 12 recorded incidents in 2011), half-barriers were installed in spring 2014, and fully commissioned on 28/29 April 2014.|$|R
30|$|In these simulations, {{both the}} {{existing}} rolling stock (Comeng) and the new concept carriage are populated to {{the capacity of the}} simulation with 250 passengers seated and standing. There are no datasets indicating the exact numbers of passenger exchanges, <b>boarding,</b> <b>alighting</b> and standees, so a number of simulations were created, incrementally increasing the percentage of passengers <b>alighting</b> and <b>boarding.</b> The percentage increments are based upon an existing study originally contracted by the Melbourne Transport Operating Company, in which Weston’s formula was used to calculate a graphical distribution of anticipated dwell times. In each simulation, the number of passengers either <b>boarding</b> or <b>alighting</b> is increased by 5  %. The distribution of these passengers, both within the carriage and on the platform, is randomly driven by the Unity software and so no two simulations can be exactly repeated. For each of the conditions, both carriages fall within the generally accepted dwell time of 20  s; however, the peak door two-corridor solution (Fig.  7) gives consistently quicker passenger exchanges. Only for very small numbers (5  % equating to 14 patrons) were exchange times roughly comparable. As the number of passengers in the <b>boarding</b> and <b>alighting</b> exchange increased, the extra door and corridor space had an observable impact on dwell time reduction.|$|R
40|$|Bus transit {{reliability}} {{depends on}} several factors including {{the route of}} travel, traffic conditions, time of day, and conditions at the bus stops along the route. The number of passengers <b>alighting</b> or <b>boarding,</b> fare payment method, dwell time (DT), {{and the location of}} the bus stop also affect the overall reliability of bus transit service. This study defines a new variable, Total Bus Stop Time (TBST) which includes DT and the time it takes a bus to safely maneuver into a bus stop and the re-entering the main traffic stream. It is thought that, if the TBST is minimized at bus stops, the overall reliability of bus transit along routes could be improved. This study focused on developing a TBST model for bus stops located near intersections and at mid-blocks using ordinary least squares method based on data collection at 60 bus stops, 30 of which were near intersections while the remaining were at mid-blocks in Washington DC. The field data collection was conducted during the morning, mid-day, and evening peak hours. The following variables were observed at each bus stop: bus stop type, number of passengers <b>alighting</b> or <b>boarding,</b> DT, TBST, number of lanes on approach to the bus stop, presence of parking, and bus pad length. The data was analyzed and all statistical inferences were conducted based on 95 % confidence interval. The results show that the TBST could be used to aid in improving planning and scheduling of transit bus systems in an urban area...|$|R
30|$|The {{elementary}} {{interaction between}} the vehicle and the passenger during <b>boarding,</b> <b>alighting</b> and travelling aboard.

50|$|While another widely stated {{benefit of}} low floor buses is quicker {{boarding}} for able-bodied passengers {{due to the}} lack of steps, studies have found the opposite effect in the UK. This is apparently due to the prevailing system of operation where passengers enter and exit through one single front door. It has been suggested that the previous 1980s/90s high floor step entrance buses which featured a centre rail, encouraged a bi-directional flow of entering and exiting passengers simultaneously. The removal of the pole to allow wheelchair/buggy access created the situation where the quintessentially polite British bus passenger would wait for all passengers to <b>alight</b> before <b>boarding,</b> leading to an increase in dwell times.|$|R

40|$|High-frequency heavy rail {{operations}} {{are subject to}} performance vari ability, {{partly due to the}} impact of passsenger loads on the system. Specif ically, vehicle dwell times at stations contribute to much of the running time and headway variations, constraining performance and service qual ity. Typically, dwell time is a function of passenger <b>alighting</b> and <b>board</b> ing volumes, and of the on-board crowding level. Based on observations made at stations on the MBTA Red Line, models showing linear effects in passenger boardings and alightings but nonlinear effects in the on-vehicle crowding level explains about 90 % of the observed variation in dwell times. Furthermore, the nonlinear contribution of on-vehicle congestion is shown to be detrimental only to the boarding process. This lends to poten tial operations improvements if rationalized passenger movements can be achieved at high-volume stations. ...|$|R

In the winter of 1987 a verandah was added to the front of the station and a concrete platform area created and the station became one of the most popular for lineside photographers. The site was further improved in 2001 or 2002 when a pumping station for the all-island sewer network was installed at the rear of the station: vehicular access was improved and a platform to fit three coaches was added, in the form of a wall of sleepers which has been back-filled to provide a half-height platform for <b>alighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> passengers.|$|R
