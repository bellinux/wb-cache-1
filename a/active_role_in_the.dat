5|$|During his tenure, {{the workers}} in the Royal dockyards demanded an {{increase}} in pay due {{to an increase in}} living costs. St Vincent reacted by dismissing the ringleaders and every man who had taken an <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strike. He eventually agreed to a small temporary allowance for the purchase of bread while the price of bread remained high.|$|E
5|$|His reign was {{inextricably}} {{connected to}} the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman domination. Although there exist no historical sources which prove that he took <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> defence of the country, in Bulgarian folklore Ivan Shishman is portrayed as a legendary and heroic ruler who desperately fought against the overwhelming Ottoman forces. There are numerous sites, geographical features and fortresses named after him throughout Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from three}} destroyers {{launched}} in 1940 and four submarines from the inter-war years, Brazil's warships were old and mostly obsolete pre-First World War vessels. The mainstays of the fleet, Minas Geraes, São Paulo, , and , {{were all over}} thirty years old. Although Minas Geraes had been further refitted from 1939 to 1943, the ship was still too old and in too poor a condition for any <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Second World War; instead, the dreadnought was anchored as a floating battery in the port of Salvador {{for the duration of}} the war.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge and Minnesota Territory's Henry Mower Rice {{were among}} the speculators who {{invested}} in land near present-day Superior, Wisconsin. Rice disliked Minnesota's territorial governor, Willis A. Gorman, and petitioned Pierce to replace him with Breckinridge. Pierce twice investigated Gorman, but found no grounds to remove him from office. Breckinridge fell ill when traveling to view his investments in mid-1855 {{and was unable to}} campaign in the state elections. Know Nothings captured every state office and six congressional districts—including the Eighth District—and Breckinridge sent regrets to friends in Washington, D.C., promising to take a more <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1856 campaigns.|$|E

5|$|Since reunification, Germany {{has taken}} a more <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> European Union. Together with its European {{partners}} Germany signed the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, established the Eurozone in 1999, and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to Afghanistan {{as part of a}} NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban. These deployments were controversial since Germany is bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles.|$|E
5|$|Susanto Pudjomartono, {{former chief}} editor of Tempo, became The Jakarta Post second chief editor on 1 August 1991, after Siagian {{was chosen to}} be Indonesia's {{ambassador}} to Australia. Under Pudjomartono's leadership, the paper began publishing more original work and doing less translation; reporters {{were also asked to}} take a more <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day-to-day operations of the paper. The paper also became more vocal regarding politics, taking a pro-democracy stance like Tempo. It soon converted its offices into a new, two-story building built using the Kompas pension fund and expanded to 12 pages.|$|E
5|$|The next {{rebellion}} against royal power in Transylvania {{broke out in}} 1467. Irritated by a new tax that King Matthias Corvinus had just introduced, representatives of the Three Nations concluded an alliance against the monarch and declared the three incumbent voivodes (the brothers Counts John and Sigismund Szentgyörgyi and Berthold Ellerbach) their leaders. The king put down the revolt in a week, but did not sentence the three voivodes, because their <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> revolt was never proven.|$|E
50|$|Together {{with the}} Blackstone River to the north, the Woonasquatucket was {{designated}} an American Heritage River in 1998.

5|$|The stage musical {{follows the}} basic {{structure}} of the film, but there are some differences between the two. In this version, Ursula is Triton's sister and Ariel's aunt. In a new subplot, Grimsby holds a contest inviting all the princesses in the land for a singing competition for Eric to choose his bride; Ariel cannot sing, but she dances for Eric, and he chooses her. Ariel also has a more <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final battle, where she is the one who defeats Ursula by destroying her Nautilus shell that contains her power.|$|E
5|$|After his maiden speech, Breckinridge {{took a more}} <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House. In {{debate with}} Ohio's Joshua Reed Giddings, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's {{constitutionality}} and criticized Giddings for hindering the return of fugitive slaves. He opposed Tennessee Congressman Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill, fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two Potomac River bridges to avoid higher costs later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's hemp farmers, voting against giving the president ten more appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy, and opposing funds for a sculpture of George Washington because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a toga.|$|E
5|$|Both vessels were {{involved}} in the operations off Lissa in July 1866, but neither took part in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July. Formidabile had been damaged by Austrian coastal fortifications the day before, and had withdrawn for repairs; Terribile was ready for action, but had been preparing to attack Lissa and was too far south to take an <b>active</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battle. Both ships saw minimal use in the 1870s and 1880s, until both were withdrawn from service for use as training ships. Formidabile and Terribile served in this capacity until 1903 and 1904, respectively, when they were sold and broken up for scrap.|$|E
