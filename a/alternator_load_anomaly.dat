50|$|The {{windings}} of an alternator {{have a large}} inductance. When {{the vehicle}} battery is being charged, the alternator supplies it with a large current, the magnitude of which {{is controlled by the}} current in the field winding. If the battery becomes disconnected while it is being charged the <b>alternator</b> <b>load</b> suddenly decreases. However the alternator's regulator cannot quickly cause the field current to decrease sufficiently, so the alternator continues to generate a large current. This large current causes the voltage on the vehicle bus to increase significantly -- well above the normal and regulated level.|$|R
50|$|Poorly {{engineered}} underdrive pulleys {{can cause}} unwanted side effects; {{this is due}} to not spinning the alternator, power steering, and/or air conditioning fast enough. This leads to low alternator voltage, weak/no power steering assist, and weak/no air conditioning effectiveness, especially at idle/low RPM. The most commonly seen result is lighting may dim, or the stereo may cut out. Too much underdrive for a race car is not much of a concern due to the high RPMs they run at, but for daily driven vehicles it can lead to a dead battery if too much time is spend at idle or low RPM. Additionally, an underdrive pulley will not reduce the power consumed by the alternator, as the <b>alternator's</b> <b>load</b> is automatically adjusted by its control circuit to match the electrical load regardless of input speed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this study, the {{vibration}} {{effects of a}} vortex that occurred in high-head Francis turbines and an alternator are examined. The vortex effect, which directly affects the efficiency {{and the quality of}} the energy, was tested at the Darca- 1 hydroelectric power plant (HPP) located in Ordu Province, Turkey. Formed by undissolved oxygen in the water, the vortex effect, which is parallel to the <b>alternator</b> <b>load,</b> causes tremendous vibration within the alternator and Francis turbine bearings. This problem, which has a direct negative effect on the alternator capacity, was solved by adding an air-admission system. In doing so, power production was increased by 11. 11 %, from 44 MW to 49. 5 MW. This caused a significant head loss, specifically in the Francis turbines.

The performance of candidate suppressor devices then can be evaluated against the withstand goals set for the equipment. The various suppressors divide into two classes of generic behavior. The key to a universal procedure for evaluating both classes lies in representing transients as quasi-current sources of defined current impulse duration. The available surge current is established by the Thevenin equivalent transient voltage and source impedance. A load line drawn on the V-I characteristic graph of the suppressor quickly determines the clamping voltage and peak current. These values then {{can be compared to}} the requirement.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{electric}} tracing of the load variation of an induction machine supplied by the mains. A load trouble, like a torque dip, affects the machine supply current and consequently {{it should be possible}} to use the current pattern to detect features of the torque pattern, using the machine itself as a torque sensor. But current signature depends on many phenomena and misunderstandings are possible. At first the effect of different <b>load</b> <b>anomalies</b> on current spectrum, in comparison with other machine troubles like rotor asymmetries, are investigated. Reference is made to low frequency torque disturbances, which cause a quasistationary machine behavior. Simplified relationships, validated by simulation results and by experimental results, are developed to address the current spectrum features. In order to detect on-lines anomalies, a current signature extraction is performed by the time-frequency spectrum approach. This method allows the detection of random fault as well.

40|$|The Department of Energy, the Stirling Technology Company (STC), and the NASA Glenn Research Center are {{developing}} Stirling convertors for Stirling radioisotope generators to provide electrical power for future NASA deep space missions. STC is developing the 55 -We technology demonstration convertor (TDC) {{under contract to}} the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy recently named Lockheed Martin as the system integration contractor for the Stirling radioisotope generator development project. Lockheed Martin will develop the Stirling radioisotope generator engineering unit and has contract options to develop the qualification unit and the first flight unit. Glenn s role includes an in-house project to provide convertor, component, and materials testing and evaluation {{in support of the}} overall power system development. As a part of this work, Glenn has established an in-house Stirling research laboratory for testing, analyzing, and evaluating Stirling machines. STC has built four 55 -We convertors for NASA, and these are being tested at Glenn. A cross-sectional view of the 55 -We TDC is shown in the figure. Of critical importance to the successful development of the Stirling convertor for space power applications is the development of a lightweight and highly efficient linear alternator. In support, Glenn has been developing finite element analysis and finite element method tools for performing various linear alternator thermal and electromagnetic analyses and evaluating design configurations. A three-dimensional magnetostatic finite element model of STC's 55 -We TDC linear alternator was developed to evaluate the demagnetization fields affecting the alternator magnets. Since the actual linear alternator hardware is symmetric to the quarter section about the axis of motion, only a quarter section of the alternator was modeled. The components modeled included the mover laminations, the neodymium-iron-boron magnets, the stator laminations, and the copper coils. The three-dimensional magnetostatic model was then coupled with a circuit simulator model of the <b>alternator</b> <b>load</b> and convertor controller. The coupled model was then used to generate alternator terminal voltage and current predictions. The predicted voltage and current waveforms agreed well with the experimental data, which tended to validate the accuracy of the coupled model.

We hypothesised that the pathophysiological mechanism involved may be impairment of intestinal gas transit. Aim—To investigate intestinal gas transit and tolerance in IBS patients compared with healthy subjects. Methods—A gas mixture (N 2, O 2, and CO 2 in venous proportions) was infused into the jejunum of 20  patients with IBS and 20  healthy controls at 12  ml/min for four hours. Gas evacuation, initially flatus from the anus (two hours) and then intrarectally (two hours), was continuously recorded. Symptom perception (0 - 6 scale) and abdominal distension were measured at 10  minute intervals. Results—After two hours of external gas (flatus) collection, 18  of 20  IBS patients had developed gas retention (> 400 ml), increased gastrointestinal symptoms (score > 3), or abdominal distension (> 3 mm girth increment) compared with only four of 20  control subjects.
