5|$|Boise National Forest's 2010 forest plan {{recognizes that}} fire and other {{disturbances}} play {{important roles in}} maintaining the character and function of ecosystems. However, previous management strategies (as recently as the 1990 forest plan) treated fire as an undesirable process, and the Organic Act of 1897 explicitly stated that forests were {{to be protected from}} destruction by fire. In historic conditions fires naturally occurred on the landscape; the suppression of fires allowed dead trees to accumulate in excess of historic levels and land cover types to change, such as <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> higher shrub and tree densities. An estimated 14 percent of the land in Boise National Forest has been affected by fires since the early 1990s, and about 10 percent of the land capable of timber production was burned so severely that land cover shifted from forest to grass and shrubland (as of 2010).|$|E
50|$|Four {{mechanisms}} for thermal isomerizations have been proposed: a dyotropic mechanism, a diradical mechanism, and two benzene ring contraction mechanisms; <b>a</b> 1,2-carbon <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> carbene preceding <b>a</b> 1,2-hydrogen <b>shift,</b> and <b>a</b> 1-2-hydrogen <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> carbene followed by <b>a</b> 1,2-carbon <b>shift.</b> The dyotropic mechanism involves concerted 1,2-shifts as displayed below.

5|$|Despite the {{successful}} debut, 757 sales remained stagnant {{for most of}} the 1980s, a consequence of declining fuel prices and <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> smaller aircraft in the post-deregulation U.S. market. Although no direct competitor existed, 150-seat narrow-bodies such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 were cheaper to acquire and carried nearly as many passengers as some airlines' 757s. A three-year sales drought abated in November 1983 when Northwest Airlines placed orders for 20 aircraft, which averted a costly production rate decrease. In December 1985, a freighter model, the , was announced following a launch order for 20 aircraft from UPS Airlines, and in February 1986, a freighter-passenger combi model, the , was launched with an order for one aircraft from Royal Nepal Airlines. The freighter model included a main deck cargo hold and entered service with UPS in September 1987. The combi model could carry both cargo and passengers on its main deck and entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in September 1988.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the Palace of Westminster and the Tower of London {{were the}} main residences of the English Sovereign until Henry VIII {{acquired}} the Palace of Whitehall. Whitehall was destroyed by fire in 1698, leading to <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> St James's Palace. Although replaced as the monarch's primary London residence by Buckingham Palace in 1837, St James's is still the senior palace and remains the ceremonial Royal residence.

Airports that discharge the collected aircraft deicing fluid directly to waters of the U.S. must also meet numeric discharge requirements for chemical oxygen demand. A report in 2000 stated that ethylene glycol was becoming less popular for aircraft deicing in the U.S., due to its reporting requirements and adverse environmental impacts (p.213), and noted <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> the use of propylene glycol (p.I-3).|$|E

5|$|The natural diets {{of snakes}} in the {{widespread}} viper genus Echis are highly varied, and include arthropods, such as scorpions, {{as well as}} vertebrates. Various Echis species consume different quantities of arthropods in their diet. A study carried out in 2009 injected scorpions with the venom of various Echis species, and found a high correlation between the proportion of arthropods that the snakes consumed in their natural habitat, and the toxicity of their venom to scorpions. The researchers also found evidence that the evolution of venom more toxic to arthropods was related {{to an increase in}} the proportion of arthropods in the snakes' diet, and that diet and venom may have evolved by a process of coevolution. A phylogeny of the genus constructed using mitochondrial DNA showed that one instance of a change in venom composition in the species ancestral to all Echis snakes was correlated with <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> an arthropod based diet, whereas another shift in a more recent lineage was correlated with <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> a diet of vertebrates. Despite the higher toxicity of the venom of arthropod-consuming species, it was not found to incapacitate or kill prey any faster than that of species with fewer arthropods in their diet. Thus, the venom is thought to have evolved to minimize the volume required, as the production of venom carries a significant metabolic cost, thus providing a fitness benefit. This pattern is also found in other lineages. Similar results were obtained by a 2012 study which found that the venom of arthropod-consuming Echis species was more toxic to locusts than that of vertebrate-consuming species.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{hypothesis}} that snake venom had a single evolutionary origin, venom {{in a number of}} lineages of snakes subsequently atrophied. Evidence of such atrophication has been found in several snakes. A 2005 study in the marbled sea snake, Aipysurus eydouxii found that the gene for a three-fingered protein found in the venom had undergone a deletion of two nucleotide bases which made the venom 50-100 times less toxic than it had been previously. This change was correlated with a change in diet from fish to a diet consisting almost entirely of fish eggs, suggesting that the adaptation to an egg diet had removed the selection pressure needed to maintain a highly toxic venom, allowing the venom genes to accumulate deleterious mutations. A similar venom degradation following <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> an egg-based diet has been found in the Common egg-eater Dasypeltis scabra, whose diet consists entirely of birds' eggs, meaning that the snake had no use for its venom. This has led biologists to suggest that if venom is not used by a species, it is rapidly lost.|$|E

5|$|I. Molto moderato. This {{movement}} {{employs a}} three-key exposition. The first theme introduces a G-flat trill that anticipates the following harmonic events – <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> G-flat major {{in the central}} section of the main theme, and, after {{a return to the}} tonic, an enharmonic shift to F-sharp minor {{at the start of the}} second theme. After a colorful harmonic excursion, the third tonal area arrives in the traditional dominant key (F major). In contrast to the previous sonatas, here the development section elaborates on several different themes from the exposition. It reaches a dramatic climax in D minor, in which the first theme is presented, fluctuating between D minor and the home key, in a manner similar to the parallel passage from the previous sonata (see above). In the recapitulation, the bass line in the first theme rises to B-flat instead of descending to F (as in the exposition), and the second theme enters in B minor, instead of F-sharp minor. The rest of the exposition is repeated without alterations, transposed a fourth up, meaning that it returns to the home key, B-flat, for the third tonal area. The coda once again recalls the first theme, although only fragmentarily.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} century, celadon was a prized import in East Africa, which was {{initially}} {{obtained from the}} Ming Dynasty in exchange for ivory. However, knowledge of direct exchange with the Chinese is restricted to a single account of a Chinese fleet harbored off of Malindi and Mombasa between 1417 and 1419. The number of imports from China and elsewhere continued to increase throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, represented by {{a large number of}} black on yellow Islamic wares and celadon. Also during the fourteenth century, local wares began to diversify with Gedi's expanding economy. During {{the beginning and end of}} the fifteenth century, respectively, blue and white porcelain began to gradually replace celadon and monochrome Islamic wares completely replaced black on yellow types. During the same century, local wares began to change with the reduction in the number of incised ornamental patterns and <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> long necked-pots, compared to earlier short-necked variants. In the following century, blue and white porcelain and monochrome Islamic wares became the dominant imports; a trend that began to emerge in the previous century and would continue until Gedi's decline in the seventeenth century.|$|E
