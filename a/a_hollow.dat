5|$|Permanent body piercings are {{performed}} {{by creating an}} opening in the body using a sharp object through the area to be pierced. This can either be done by puncturing an opening using a needle (usually <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> medical needle) or scalpel or by removing tissue, either with a dermal punch or through scalpelling.|$|E
5|$|When not served alone, falafel {{is often}} served with flat or unleavened bread {{when it is}} wrapped within lafa or stuffed in <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> pita. Tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, and other garnishes can be added. Falafel is {{commonly}} accompanied by tahini.|$|E

5|$|A carcass was <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> {{projectile}} usually formed {{either by}} an iron cage of ribs joining two small rings or a cast iron ball with holes. A carcass was {{so named because}} the iron cage was thought to resemble the ribs of a body. A carcass {{was filled with a}} highly flammable mixture. Carcasses were used for the first time by the French under Louis XIV in 1672.|$|E
5|$|All of the high-penetrating (armor-piercing) and hollow-point {{ammunition}} {{is classified}} as category A (see above). The alternative to <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> point ammunition was Federal EFMJ, which has been classified into the arms group A in mid 2009, effectively outlawing it. Therefore, only full metal jacket or soft-nosed semi-jacketed rounds and or just unjacketed bullets (lead only) are allowed. Generally, no ammunition with higher wounding potential is allowed.|$|E
5|$|Great feats {{were made}} during the third century in both the {{digestive}} and reproductive systems. Herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands, but the small intestine and liver. He showed that the uterus is <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes. He recognized that spermatozoa were produced by the testes {{and was the first}} to identify the prostate gland.|$|E

5|$|Needle {{receiving}} tubes: <b>A</b> <b>hollow</b> tube made of metal, shatter-resistant {{glass or}} plastic, needle receiving tubes, like forceps, {{are used to}} support the tissue at the piercing site and are common in septum and some cartilage piercings. Not only are these tubes intended to support the tissue, but they also receive the needle once it has passed through the tissue, offering protection from the sharp point. Needle receiving tubes are not used in the freehand piercing method.|$|E
5|$|Some protein {{complexes}} {{contain a}} large central cavity that is {{isolated from the}} remainder of the cytosol. One example of such an enclosed compartment is the proteasome. Here, a set of subunits form <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> barrel containing proteases that degrade cytosolic proteins. Since these would be damaging if they mixed freely with {{the remainder of the}} cytosol, the barrel is capped by a set of regulatory proteins that recognize proteins with a signal directing them for degradation (a ubiquitin tag) and feed them into the proteolytic cavity.|$|E

5|$|Species that {{resemble}} A.deserticola include the desert fungi Montagnea arenaria and Podaxis pistillaris. Montagnea arenaria is a whitish stalked puffball with <b>a</b> <b>hollow,</b> woody stalk and a loose sac-like volva {{at the base}} of the stem. It is topped by a thin disc-like cap with blackish gill plates suspended around the margin. Podaxis pistillaris has a cylindrical to oval white to brownish cap with a paper-thin wall atop a slender stem. When mature, the cap contains powdery, dark brown spores.|$|E
5|$|Squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} {{accounts for}} about 30% of lung cancers. They typically occur close to large airways. <b>A</b> <b>hollow</b> cavity and associated cell death are commonly found {{at the center of}} the tumor. About 9% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinoma. These are so named because the cancer cells are large, with excess cytoplasm, large nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli.|$|E
5|$|The Zytglogge's {{internal}} layout {{has changed}} over time to reflect the tower's change of purpose from guard tower to city prison to clock tower. The thirteenth-century guard tower was {{not much more than}} <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> shell of walls that was open towards the city in the east. Only in the fourteenth century was a layer of four storeys inserted.|$|E

5|$|The body {{is divided}} into coeloms, {{compartments}} lined with mesothelium. The main body cavity, {{under the crown of}} tentacles, is called the metacoelom, and the tentacles and their base share the mesocoelom. Above the mouth is the epistome, <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> lid which can close the mouth. The cavity in the epistome is sometimes called the protocoelom, although other authors disagree that it is a coelom and Ruppert, Fox and Barnes think it is built by a different process.|$|E
5|$|The {{plants are}} {{sometimes}} grown as ornamentals. Dead stems decay to leave <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> wooden tube with {{a pattern of}} lengthwise slits. These are sometimes used as canes or to make curios. The Roman Catholic Penitentes of New Mexico formerly tied fresh stems to their bare backs in Holy Week processions. The Zuni people use the imbricata variety ceremonially.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus classifies undershrubs as spiny, such as thistle, eryngo and safflower, and spineless, such as marjoram, savory, sage, horehound, and balm.

Roses, he writes, vary {{in number of}} petals, roughness of bark, colour and scent; they have five, twelve, twenty or more petals, and those with the sweetest scent come from Cyrene, and are used for making perfume. The times of flowering of different species are listed.|$|E

50|$|Berkowitz {{is known}} for his {{critique}} of American higher education, particularly of campus culture and university governance. Speaking in 2015, he summed his criticisms as:...what I see is <b>a</b> <b>hollowing</b> out of the core curriculum, I see, I should say <b>a</b> <b>hollowing</b> out of the core, I see a politicizing of the curriculum. I see curtailing of freedom of speech, liberty of thought and discussion on campus. And increasingly, especially these last several years, an evisceration of due process on campus for students accused these days, usually in sexual harassment and sexual assault cases. So I see a bad situation.|$|R
5|$|There are prehistoric fort sites at promontories near Kilmory, Papadil and Glen Shellesder of {{uncertain}} date. These primarily {{consist of}} a wall dividing the promontory {{from the rest of}} the island, but at Kilmory, there is also a rampart with <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> containing the traces of an interior structure. At Shellesder, the promontory contains the remains of three round stone-walled huts, one of which integrates with the dividing wall. A small number of cairns, again of uncertain date, are also located along the coast.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} that Aizen kidnapped Orihime, Rukia and friends head for Hueco Mundo to rescue her. While there, Rukia encounters the Espada, Aaroniero Arruruerie, who is revealed to have possession of Kaien's body. Saddened {{that she had}} not saved her mentor from the control of <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> as she had previously thought, Rukia manages to kill Aaroniero. Rukia is badly injured during the battle, and it is not until Soul Society sends reinforcements to Hueco Mundo that she is revived and her wounds are healed. She later assists Ichigo in his rescue to save Orihime from the Espada Ulquiorra Cifer by engaging the remaining Arrancars until requiring support. Following Aizen's defeat and the loss of Ichigo's Soul Reaper powers, Rukia and Ichigo bid one another farewell as Ichigo loses the ability to sense Rukia's presence.|$|E
5|$|Businesses in Chinatown {{attempted}} to raise $200,000 {{to build an}} 11-story bell tower pagoda {{at the south end}} of the park. The tower was planned to be constructed of brick and stone with <b>a</b> <b>hollow</b> interior. While visitors would not have been able to climb the structure, they would have been able to walk through an entrance at its base. Chicago Sun-Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell tower to be the park's most important feature. Despite the Taiwanese government making an early commitment to help finance the tower, it was never constructed.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} non-uniform offsetting and biarcsfitting {{methods to}} speed up the part building process and increase the accuracy of built part for Rapid Prototyping (RP) processes. The non-uniform offsetting method is developed to build <b>a</b> <b>hollowed</b> object by finding correct offset contours of the Stereolithography (STL) models. Building <b>a</b> <b>hollowed</b> object instead of a solid part can significantly reduce the material consumption and the build time. The Biarcs fitting method is developed to improve the accuracy of the hollowed parts by generating smooth cross-sectional contours. The results show that the presented techniques can improve the efficiency and the accuracy of RP processes...|$|R

A literature review indicates {{that this is the}} first description of a shelter of the species, both in <b>a</b> <b>hollowed</b> tree and in Amazonia. This observation can indicate a strong relationship between the species' breeding cycle with the annual dynamics of Amazonian rivers. We discuss potential advantages and disadvantages of breeding when water level is high...|$|R
50|$|The glide kip {{may be used}} as a mount or a {{connecting}} skill. The glide kip {{is performed}} by swinging in <b>a</b> piked <b>hollow</b> position, toes in front, under the bar to extend to <b>a</b> straight <b>hollow</b> position parallel to the floor. Once extended, the gymnast quickly pulls his or her feet towards the bar while simultaneously pushing down with straight arms to arrive in <b>a</b> straight <b>hollow</b> front support on the bar. Taller gymnasts may perform the glide kip in <b>a</b> straddle <b>hollow</b> rather than piked hollow swing, joining the feet together at extension, before initiating the kipping action.|$|R
