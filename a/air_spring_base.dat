A 1 -order ordinary differential matrix equation for the state vector of revolutionary shells under internal pressure is derived based on the non-moment theory of elastic thin shell.

In {{order to}} reduce the road damage of heavy trucks, {{comprehensively}} considering ride comfort and road friendliness, the multi-objective optimization method of vehicle suspension parameters with non-linear <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> was presented <b>based</b> on Simulink-Mfile mixed programming. The simulation model including vehicle dynamics module, road roughness module, ride comfort and road friendliness evaluation index modules was constructed in Simulink platform, and the multi-objective optimization model was developed in Mfile program which took the linear weighted sum of ride comfort and road friendliness indexes as the objective. Then the suspension parameters were optimized with genetic algorithm (GA). The results showed that, compared with before optimization, the vehicle ride comfort and road friendliness could be synthetically improved.

40|$|In railway vehicles, <b>air</b> <b>springs</b> {{are used}} for {{isolating}} vibrations and improving comfort for the passengers. For the prediction of the vibrations in the car body, a valid model of the <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> is needed. A new model for simulation of the <b>air</b> <b>springs</b> behavior has recently been developed at the Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. The model is three-dimensional and consists of two parts, describing vertical and horizontal behavior. The thirteen input parameters of the model have, until now, been determined experimentally. Since experiments are time demanding and equipment expensive the question arose, in-house Bombardier, {{if there is a}} way to derive the parameters without experiments, using knowledge of the <b>air</b> <b>springs</b> physical behavior. The ambition of this report is to answer that question. The report begins with a literature study of <b>air</b> <b>springs.</b> Topics like history, behavior, thermodynamics and physical relations are covered. A few existing <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> models are investigated to give an understanding of <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> modeling. As for the rest, this report focuses on describing the new <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> model and determining the input parameters of it. Five of the model parameters are determined by means of thermodynamic and fluid dynamic constitutions. All of these belong to the vertical model. The parameters are calculated and simulated for a certain <b>air</b> <b>spring.</b> The simulation is made in a MATLAB code, developed in-house Bombardier. The result of the simulations is a plot of the total vertical stiffness versus frequency. This plot shows a sufficiently good agreement to the stiffness measurements for the specific <b>air</b> <b>spring.</b> The remaining eight parameters, which depend on rubber properties, are not dealt with in this report. These parameters need, even henceforth, to be determined with experiments and experimental analysis. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

In the most new rail–vehicle models, developed by researchers, the thermo–dynamical effects of <b>air</b> <b>springs</b> are ignored and secondary suspension is modeled by simple springs and dampers.

Result from field test shows remarkable agreement between proposed model and experimental data. Effects of air suspension parameters on the system performances are investigated here and then these parameters are tuned to minimize Sperling ride comfort index during the trip. Results showed that by modification of air suspension parameters, passengers comfort is improved and ride comfort index is reduced about 10 %. developed by researchers [1]-[7], the thermo–dynamical effects of <b>air</b> <b>springs</b> are ignored and secondary suspension is modeled by simple springs and dampers.
