25|$|The {{recovery}} of bodies was slow. Spanish law required that, {{in order to}} avoid the spread of disease, bodies be buried within 24 hours and remain buried for at least five years. Three bodies were caught in the wreckage at the surface. But no one noticed them until February 23 (a full week after the explosion), and by then vultures had devoured much of the corpses. Although only 19 corpses had been found, the city of Havana held a funeral for the dead. Thousands of people turned out for the funeral cortege <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Spanish military bore the 19 elaborate coffins with great ceremony through the streets to Colon Cemetery, Havana. Another 135 bodies were recovered on February 19. The New York Times reported that this included the limbs of about 10 men. Twenty-four of them were identifiable. Two of the eight wounded (including Coxswain Alfred J. Holland) died that day as well.|$|E
500|$|Leaving school, young William Taswell {{stood on}} Westminster Stairs {{a mile away}} <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> flames crept round the cathedral and the burning {{scaffolding}} ignited the timbered roof beams. Within half an hour, the lead roof was melting, and the books and papers in the crypt caught with a roar. [...] "The stones of Paul's flew like grenados," [...] reported Evelyn in his diary, [...] "the melting lead running down the streets in a stream, and the very pavements glowing with fiery redness, so as no horse, nor man, was able to tread on them." [...] The cathedral was quickly a ruin.|$|E
500|$|... 65 Squadron {{remained}} in the battle until its end in October 1940, but Finucane gained no further successes. On 8 November the unit was moved to RAF Leuchars and then on 29 November back to No. 11 Group RAF in the south at RAF Tangmere near Chichester in West Sussex. The squadron remained idle for the winter as The Blitz and the German night attacks began and lasted in to the following spring. Finucane billeted near Oving. While drinking at a nearby pub overlooking the harbour an air raid struck Southampton. Finucane heard the drone of German bombers over the Isle of Wight in the distance <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> pathfinders marked the city. They clambered into a Wolseley Hornet two-seater car and headed into the town to seek out acquaintances of a squadron-mate. After seeing the destruction in the city Finucane remarked: [...] "Until this war is won we must shoot every Jerry from the sky." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bedser was aged 36 by {{the first}} Test of the 1954–55 tour of Australia. [...] He took 1 for 131 as seven catches were dropped off his bowling, {{including}} Arthur Morris (153) before he had scored – and England lost by an innings. He was subsequently diagnosed as suffering from shingles and despite a recovery and a green wicket tailor-made for his bowling in the second Test he was dropped from the side, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> younger Frank Tyson and Brian Statham bowled England to victory. He was recalled for one Test against South Africa in 1955.|$|E
2500|$|Ten {{days later}} off Indochina, Trout {{launched}} two torpedoes at a cargo ship from [...] <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> unidentified ship sank immediately. On 29 January, the submarine launched three torpedoes at a destroyer {{believed to be}} the Thai Phra Ruang (the former R-class destroyer HMS Radiant) and watched each run true to the target. However, all proved to be duds. On 7 February, she sighted tanker Nisshin Maru No. 2 moored off Lutong, Borneo. She made a submerged approach, launched two torpedoes at the target, heard one explosion, and observed smoke rise from the stern of the tanker. However, no sinking upon this occasion was confirmed. The Nisshin Maru No. 2 was then towed and scrapped South of Ishigaki Island on 16 April 1943.|$|E
2500|$|This same lateral {{fluidity}} {{was first}} demonstrated conclusively {{on the cell}} surface by Frye and Edidin in 1970. They fused two cells labeled with different membrane-bound fluorescent tags <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> two dye populations mixed. The results of this experiment were key {{in the development of}} the [...] "fluid mosaic" [...] model of the cell membrane by Singer and Nicolson in 1972. According to this model, biological membranes are composed largely of bare lipid bilayer with proteins penetrating either half way or all the way through the membrane. These proteins are visualized as freely floating within a completely liquid bilayer. This was not the first proposal of a heterogeneous membrane structure. Indeed, as early as 1904 Nathansohn proposed a “mosaic” of water permeable and impermeable regions. But the fluid mosaic model was the first to correctly incorporate fluidity, membrane channels and multiple modes of protein/bilayer coupling into one theory.|$|E

2500|$|The 1913 {{match between}} the Wolverines and Quakers was played in Ann Arbor. [...] The {{night before the}} game, a mass meeting was held at Hill Auditorium {{featuring}} speeches by University President Harry Burns Hutchins, Coach Yost, and others. [...] Highlights of the night included the debut of a new song called [...] "Michigan Men of Steel" [...] and the [...] "new Hawaiian yell" [...] which was [...] "enthusiastically received." [...] The game itself was played with wet snow falling at times and rain at other times. [...] The Penn team did not appear at Ferry Field until 21 minutes after the scheduled start time, having failed to leave sufficient time for train travel between Detroit and Ann Arbor. [...] A record crowd, estimated at 20,000 to 22,000, filled the grandstands and bleachers to capacity <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Michigan band, [...] "treading to strains of 'The Victors,' marched {{up and down the}} field and under the goal posts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, Richard James, a naval {{mechanical}} engineer {{stationed at the}} William Cramp and Sons shipyards in Philadelphia, was developing springs that could support and stabilize sensitive instruments aboard ships in rough seas. James accidentally knocked one of the springs from a shelf, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> spring [...] "stepped" [...] {{in a series of}} arcs to a stack of books, to a tabletop, and to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. James's wife Betty later recalled, [...] "He came home and said, 'I think if I got the right property of steel and the right tension; I could make it walk.'" [...] James experimented with different types of steel wire over the next year, and finally found a spring that would walk. [...] Betty was dubious at first, but changed her mind after the toy was fine-tuned and neighborhood children expressed an excited interest in it. She dubbed the toy Slinky (meaning [...] "sleek and graceful"), after finding the word in a dictionary, and deciding that the word aptly described the sound of a metal spring expanding and collapsing.|$|E
2500|$|Salmide was {{stationed}} in Bordeaux, the largest port in France, when Allied forces closed in during August 1944. On 19 August 1944 {{he was ordered to}} destroy the city's entire port infrastructure, stretching across seven miles, with explosives—a plan intended to prevent the use of the port to reinforce Allied forces spreading through the country in the weeks following the D-Day invasion. In 1977, Salmide spoke about the incident in an interview with Reuters. He recalled, [...] "My family were Huguenots, and I acted according to my Christian conscience, I could not accept that the port would be wantonly destroyed when the war was clearly lost." [...] On 22 August 1944, four days before the planned destruction of the port, he blew up the munitions depot where the Germans had stored 4,000 fuses to be used in destroying the port. Salmide [...] "laid strips of dynamite inside the supply bunker filled with demolition hardware and thousands of pounds of ordnance <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> city shook from the huge explosion." [...] Salmide's actions killed approximately 50 Germans, but were credited with saving an estimated 3,500 civilians.|$|E

2500|$|The mood aboard Bismarck was mixed. Seaman Adolf Eich was {{off duty}} for some fresh air. He climbed {{up to the}} bridge {{for as long as}} nobody stopped him. When he got there he found the {{atmosphere}} pleasant. Lindemann was shaking the hand of Adalbert Schneider for his Knight's Cross award bestowed upon him for the destruction of Hood. Lütjens also looked pleased. As the morning wore on the atmosphere changed. Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann wearing a life jacket <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> captain ate his breakfast in silence. He did not return Müllenheim-Rechberg's salute. Müllenheim-Rechberg also met Lütjens as the Admiral {{made his way to the}} bridge. Lütjens returned his salute as he brushed past but said nothing. To Müllenheim-Rechberg it seemed as if the two men most responsible for Bismarck had retreated into their own private worlds. That morning, on the 27 May 1941, Lütjens sent a request for a U-Boat to pick up the ship's war diary. In this last transmission, Lütjens included: [...] "Ship no longer manoeuvrable. We fight to the last shell. Long live the Führer". Lütjens did not hide their fate from his crew. He ordered the ships stores to be opened and allowed the crew to help themselves. It was a sign to all onboard Bismarck was doomed.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the thing}} began clambering {{up the side}} of the observatory, and he saw its black outline {{gradually}} blot out the skylight. Was it in retreat? He forgot about the door, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> dome shifted and creaked. Somehow he did not feel very frightened or excited now. He felt a curious sinking sensation inside him. The sharply-defined patch of light, with the black form moving across it, seemed to be growing smaller and smaller. That was curious. He began to feel very thirsty, and yet he did not feel inclined to get anything to drink. He seemed to be sliding down a long funnel.|$|E
60|$|They passed {{several small}} houses and farms, {{in front of}} each of which was {{stationed}} a sentry. Once, from the hills behind, a great white-winged aeroplane glided over his head on its way to make a reconnaissance. Queerest sight of all, here and there were peasants at work in the fields. One old man leaned upon his spade <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> car passed. Not a dozen yards from him was a great hole in the ground where a shell had burst, and a little further away a barn in ruins. The car was forced to stop here to let a cavalcade of ammunition waggons pass by. Surgeon-Major Thomson leaned from his seat and spoke to the old man.|$|E

She plumed herself not {{a little on the}} success of the table-and-legs device, but as the water rose rapidly she became anxious again, though not for herself. She waded about the hut with supreme indifference to the condition of her own lower limbs.
