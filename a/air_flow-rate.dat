40|$|Pyrometallurgical {{process is}} {{utilized}} to recover zinc {{in the form}} of high purity zinc oxide from a kind of zinc metal scrap containing 92. 49 wt% zinc. The process uses tube-type furnace, where the reactor is divided into volatilization zone and oxidization zone by flowing nitrogen gas and air. In the process, zinc is firstly volatilized to vapor in inert atmosphere of nitrogen gas and carried forward to oxidization zone by nitrogen gas, then oxidized to zinc oxide in air atmosphere. The effect of temperature, air and nitrogen gas flow-rates, and reaction time on both purity and yield of the product is investigated in detail in this study. Subsequently, the characteristics of the products are examined by X-ray diffractometer and scanning electron microscope. The obtained results demonstrated that both the purity and the yield of the product have relationships with the operation parameters. The contents of the impurities grow with the rise of temperature, with the increase of nitrogen gas or <b>air</b> <b>flow-rate,</b> and also with the extension of reaction time. However, the yield decreases with the decrease of temperature, with the reduce of nitrogen gas flow-rate, with the rise of <b>air</b> <b>flow-rate,</b> and also with the diminishment of reaction time. In addition, very low <b>air</b> <b>flow-rate</b> resulted in the increase of metallic zinc in the product and the decrease of the yield of the product at the same time.

40|$|Ingress {{occurs when}} hot {{mainstream}} {{gas from the}} turbine an-nulus is ingested through a rim seal into the wheel-space between a rotating turbine disc (the rotor) and an adjacent stationary casing (the stator). The stationary vanes and rotating blades in the annulus create circumferential variations of pressure that drive hot gas inwards into the wheel-space in regions of high external pressure. This is called externally-induced ingress. (The rotating flow in the wheel-space creates a radial pressure gradient that separately promotes radially inward flow into the wheel-space. This is known as rotationally-induced ingress). The high temperature of the ingested mainstream gas in an engine can lead to fatigue and damage to important components. This paper describes simplified computational studies of externally-induced ingress into a rotor-stator system with an axial clearance rim seal. Axisymmetric steady-state computations are carried out using the commercial computational fluid dynamics code CFX. The SST model of turbulence is used. The model geometry and boundary conditions are based on an experimental rig designed and built at the University of Bath to study fundamental features of ingestion and rim seal effectiveness, in a related project having substantial industrial involvement. It is known that simplified steady flow models can significantly underestimate ingestion from the mainstream annulus into the wheel-space. In the present work, ingestion is prescribed in the steady model {{through the use of}} boundary conditions at the axial clearance seal. The computation of the flow and heat transfer in the wheel-space is validated by comparison with previously-published experimental measurements for a simple rotor-stator system without ingestion. The computations are carried out for values of rotational Reynolds number up to around 1. 25 × 10 6 as typically used in experimental studies, and using sealing <b>air</b> <b>flow-rates</b> corresponding to non-dimensional values relevant to engine applications. The computed results show that the flow structure and heat transfer in the wheel-space at high sealing flow rates agree well with measured values for rotor-stator systems, the effects of differences between geometries being mostly small. Due to the recirculating secondary flow in the wheel-space, ingested fluid is drawn toward the surface of the stator. At lower sealing flow rates, the higher swirl of the ingested mainstream flow causes changes in the flow structure in the wheel-space. The ingested mainstream flow can come into contact with the rotor, and this could have serious consequences in practice...|$|R
40|$|A three stage {{atomizer}} {{has been}} constructed consisting of airblast, swirl and effervescent stages allowing {{for more than}} one mode to contribute to the primary and secondary atomization of a single liquid jet. While the atomization mechanisms resulting from individual modes are fairly well understood, their combined usage to control the droplet size distribution is complex and has not been investigated in detail. A study of various combinations of air-blast, swirl and effervescence is conducted using phase Doppler anemometry and droplet imaging. This is done in order to quantify the effects on the resulting spray structure including the control of the droplet size to yield a desired range of equivalence ratios in combustion applications. Preliminary results for a non-reacting spray show that for a given atomizer geometry, the air-blast stage produces sprays with a D 32 that typically ranges from 30 μm ∼ D 32 ∼ 50 μm. The resulting size distribution depends heavily on the ratio of liquid to <b>air</b> mass <b>flow-rate</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} on the geometry of the liquid and air-blast nozzles.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to better understand the}} stable operation of an LPP combustor and formulate a mechanism behind the unstable operation. A unique combustor facility was developed at the University of Michigan that incorporates the latest injector developed by GE Aircraft Engines and enables operation at elevated pressures with preheated <b>air</b> at <b>flow-rates</b> reflective of actual conditions. The large optical access has enabled the use of a multitude of state-of-the-art laser diagnostics such as PIV and PLIF, and has shed invaluable light not only into the GE injector specifically but also into gas turbine combustors in general. Results from Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) have illustrated the role of velocity, instantaneous vortices, and key recirculation zones that are all critical to the combustor’s operation. It was found that considerable differences exist between the iso-thermal and reacting flows, and between the instantaneous and mean flow fields. To image the flame, Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) of the formaldehyde radical was successfully utilized {{for the first time in}} a Jet-A flame. Parameters regarding the flame’s location and structure have been obtained that assist in interpreting the velocity results. These results have also shown that some of the fuel injected from the main fuel injectors actually reacts in the diffusion flame of the pilot. The unstable operation of the combustor was studied in depth to obtain the stability limits of the combustor, behavior of the flame dynamics, and frequencies of the oscillations. Results from simultaneous pressure and high speed chemiluminescence images have shown that the low frequency dynamics can be characterized as flashback oscillations. The results have also shown that the stability of the combustor can be explained by simple and well established premixed flame stability mechanisms. This study has allowed the development of a model that describes the instability mechanism and accurately captures the frequencies of the oscillations. By demonstrating how these classical understandings can be applied to the extremely complicated flow within LPP gas turbine combustors, new insight has been provided that will aid in the development of the next generation of cleaner, more stable gas turbine combustors...|$|R

To avoid {{a negative impact}} on the performance of the cooling tower and to optimize the turbine performance, the determination of the VAWT position in the discharge wind stream was conducted by experiment. The preferable VAWT position is where the higher wind velocity matches the positive torque area of the turbine rotation. With the proper matching among the VAWT configurations (blade number, airfoil type, operating tip-speed-ratio, etc.) and exhaust air profile, the turbine system was not only able to recover the wasted kinetic energy, it also reduced the fan motor power consumption by 4. 5 % and increased the cooling tower intake <b>air</b> <b>flow-rate</b> by 11 %. The VAWT had a free running rotational speed of 479 rpm, power coefficient of 10. 6 %, and tip-speed-ratio of 1. 88.

For the actual size of a cooling tower with a 2. 4 m outlet diameter and powered by a 7. 5 kW fan motor, it was estimated that a system with two VAWTs (side-by-side) can generate 1 kW of power which is equivalent to 13 % of energy recovery...|$|E

The tribo-charging processes in PVC and Al pipes were modeled using the response surface method of experimental design. An induction type sensor, connected to an electrometer has been employed for the measurement of the charge imparted to a well-defined section of the duct, which is equal to the charge transferred to the particles passing through that section of the pneumatic transport system. The measured data were processed by a virtual instrument developed in LabVIEW and then analyzed using a commercial software (MODDE 5. 0, Umetrics, Sweden).

The normal regeneration temperature was around 800 °C to 1000 °C but local temperature {{could be as high}} as 1300 °C. Thermal regeneration of the filter was found to depend on several factors, including, oxygen concentration in the heated air, initial particulate loading, packing density, thickness of the filtering element, and flow rate of the heated air. It was found that for regeneration to occur, the temperature of the heated air should exceed 500 °C, the filtering element should have a minimum thickness of 50 mm and a minimum initial particulate loading of 2 gram. Regeneration, and hence, heat release, was found to start earlier at higher oxygen concentration in the heated air, higher heated air flow rate, lower packing density and higher initial particulate loading. Regeneration temperature was higher at higher oxygen concentration in the heated air, lower heated <b>air</b> <b>flow-rate,</b> higher packing density and higher initial particulate loading. The results had also been compared with those of Kim et al. [12] and Park et al. [13] obtained on ceramic filter and those simulated by Garner and Dent [7]. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} generates 10 - 250 m³ of wastewater per ton of {{pulp and paper}} products. Accordingly, it is the third largest wastewater-generating industry with more than 700 types of discharged toxic contaminants. These substances are difficult to degrade by natural means and present hazardous risks to the human health (e. g. carcinogenicity, mutagenicity and endocrine disruptors) and ecosystem (e. g. scum formation, thermal impact, and eutrophication). However, conventional biological treatment methods are incapable of degrading these complex and bio-recalcitrant substances. Therefore, the main objective of this research was to develop a more sustainable integrated treatment system (consisting of coagulation process and heterogeneous photocatalysis) to effectively remove suspended solids and persistent organic contaminants in the raw pulp and paper mill effluent (PPME). Firstly, a detailed preliminary study of utilizing Cassia obtusifolia (C. obtusifolia) seed gum as a natural coagulant to pre-treat raw and undiluted PPME was investigated. At recommended coagulation process conditions (initial effluent pH = 5, C. obtusifolia seed gum dosage = 0. 75 g/L, slow-mixing velocity and time = 10 rpm and 10 min, respectively, and settling time = 1 min), C. obtusifolia seed gum removed high loadings of total suspended solids (TSS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of up to 86. 9 and 36. 2 %, respectively. Following that, the interactive effects of coagulation process conditions were evaluated. Under optimal pre-treatment conditions (C. obtusifolia seed gum dosage = 0. 17 g/L, alum dosage = 0. 09 g/L, and slow-mixing time = 3. 40 min), the combined use of C. obtusifolia seed gum and alum at natural pH of raw PPME (pH 7. 2) yielded 89. 6 and 55. 4 % of TSS and COD removals, respectively. Pre-treatment of raw and undiluted PPME using coagulation in the present work established that C. obtusifolia seed gum could be used as an alternative plant-based coagulant or as a potential coagulant aid in pre-treatment of complex industrial effluent. Photoactive Fe₂O₃-TiO₂ was synthesized in the absence of solvent and at ambient conditions using mechanochemical process (via ball milling) for the subsequent photocatalysis of pre-treated PPME. Detailed characterization studies revealed enhanced intrinsic properties of the fabricated Fe₂O₃-TiO₂. The highest photodegradation efficiency of pre-treated PPME (62. 3 % of COD removal) was achieved using Fe₂O₃-TiO₂ synthesized at 20 min of milling time, 250 rpm of milling speed, and 1 mol% of Fe₂O₃ loading. Then, the interactive influences of photocatalytic operating conditions and reusability of Fe₂O₃-TiO₂ were investigated. Under optimal photocatalytic conditions (initial effluent pH = 3. 88, Fe₂O₃-TiO₂ dosage = 1. 3 g/L, and <b>air</b> <b>flow-rate</b> = 2. 28 L/min), 80. 6 % of COD was removed from pre-treated PPME using Fe₂O₃-TiO₂. The present study established that the mechanochemical process enabled a greener and facile synthesis of a highly photoactive, recyclable and retrievable Fe₂O₃-TiO₂ that could effectively degrade industrial PPME. Lastly, this research concluded that the studied integrated treatment system of raw PPME (using coagulation process and heterogeneous photocatalysis) achieved an overall treatment efficiency of 89. 6 and 91. 6 % TSS and COD removals, respectively. This study has successfully demonstrated an effective and environmentally more sustainable integrated treatment system to degrade raw PPME...|$|E
40|$|Introdução: As concentrações séricas pós-operatórias de cálcio (Ca) ou paratormônio (PTH) têm sido aventadas como preditoras de hipoparatireoidismo após tireoidectomia total (TT). Porém, ainda não foram estabelecidos padrões mundialmente aceitos para tal fim. Objetivos: Identificar precocemente o hipoparatireoidismo pós-operatório, em pacientes submetidos à TT, por meio da dosagem de Ca e PTH séricos nas primeiras 24 horas após a cirurgia. Casuística e Métodos: Foram estudados, prospectivamente, 76 pacientes operados entre 2013 e 2014. Foram dosados Ca sérico na véspera, durante a TT, com 1, 8, 14 e 24 horas (h) de pós-operatório (PO), e PTH antes, durante, com 1 e 8 h PO. Os pacientes foram reavaliados com 7, 30 dias e com 6 meses PO e classificados como: sem hipoparatireoidismo (SH), com hipoparatireoidismo temporário (HT) ou com hipoparatireoidismo permanente (HP). Resultados: 40 pacientes (52, 6 %) foram incluídos no SH, 24 (31, 6 %) no HT e 12 (15, 8 %) no HP. O sexo feminino foi mais prevalente nos três grupos [SH: 85 %; HT: 91, 7 %; HP: 100 %; p G 2 >G 1; p 6 % do Ca em 24 h associado a queda do PTH > 70 % em 1 h ou 36 % em 8 h apresentou sensibilidade combinada de 94 % e 97 % para predição de hipocalcemia. Valores de Ca 8, 4 mg/dL em 24 h associados a PTH 15, 6 pg/mL em 1 h predizem hipocalcemia com sensibilidade de 94 % e especificidade de 68 %. Quedas mais acentuadas (93 %) do PTH, associadas a Ca 8, 4 mg/dL mostraram sensibilidade de 100 % e especificidade de 80 % para HP. Conclusões: As dosagens de Ca e PTH séricos nas primeiras 24 horas após TT foram preditoras de hipoparatireoidismo. Os valores absolutos e a variação percentual negativa do Ca maior que 10 % e do PTH maior que 75 % nas primeiras 24 h, quando comparados aos valores basais, aumentaram o risco para HT, enquanto que reduções de Ca maiores que 20 % e de PTH maiores que 90 %, aumentaram o risco para HP. This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the production, physical-chemical characteristics, {{and the application of}} betalains derived from beetroots (Beta vulgaris L.) microencapsulated by spray drying using carrier agents. Initially, we assessed the influence of process conditions (temperature and drying <b>air</b> <b>flow-rate,</b> concentration and formulation of carrier agents) on the water content of the microcapsules, process yield, solubility, betalain retention and color parameters through a central composite design 24. Particles were produced using blends of two carrier agents: maltodextrin 10 DE (Md) and modified corn starch (Am). Taking into account the results of the experimental design, a group of four samples was selected to be further evaluated regarding morphology, particle size distribution, sorption isotherms, antioxidant activity, glass transition temperature and stability to light and pH. In addition, these samples were applied as natural colorant in a model formulation of petit Suisse cheese, which was subjected to sensory evaluation for acceptance and purchase intention along with a sample of the corresponding commercial product. In all the production trials, the microcapsules presented low water content values (0. 16 to 2. 91 %) and high solubility (> 90 %). The yield ranged from 2. 96 to 81. 34 %, and betalain retention in the microcapsules ranged between 40 and 46 %. Samples with higher total carrier concentration resulted in larger particles and smoother walls, which are related to increased viscosity of the mixture to be dried; further, they were more stable under light exposure, presenting lower color changes up to 98 days of study. The encapsulation process provided high protection to the antioxidant compounds of betalains, keeping more than 70 % of the activity in these samples when compared to the results obtained for the pure extract. The highest antioxidant activity was observed in capsules with higher amount of modified starch in the formulation, as opposed to the glass transition temperature that showed higher values, thus more convenient, for the samples containing more maltodextrin, which demonstrated the protective role of these carrier agents when used together. With respect to pH, microencapsulated samples were more stable than the liquid extract, with preservation of the color, particularly at pH 8, at which there was an evident browning in the extract. The capsules also remained stable regarding color parameters in a wider range of pH when compared to the pure extract. The particles showed low hygroscopicity and the best mathematical adjustment for the sorption isotherms was obtained by the BET model. In the sensorial analysis of petit Suisse cheese, the samples containing beet extract microcapsules as a natural dye obtained answers that were in the majority among "I would probably buy" and "I doubt whether I would buy or not" the product displayed. The samples with the best purchase expectation were those containing the capsules with higher carrier content, which also obtained the highest scores in relation to the color attribute in the acceptance test...|$|E
40|$|La méthode {{standard}} de détermination de la Demande Biochimique en Oxygène (DBO- 5 jours par dilutions) présente certains inconvénients bien connus dont celui de ne pas être exploitable pour la gestion en temps réel d'un procédé d'épuration. De ce fait, divers types d'appareils d'estimation rapide de la DBO, basés sur des méthodes respirométriques, ont été imaginés dans le passé et même commercialisés pour certains. Dans cette étude, des appareils d'estimation rapide de la DBO de types bioélectrode et réacteurs à biomasse fixée (écoulement piston et parfaitement mélangé) ont été mis en oeuvre, après avoir été développés ou modifiés sur base de concepts déjà existants. Une attention particulière a été portée sur la validité de ces appareils, la crédibilité de leurs mesures et la définition de leur champ d'action. De par leur principe de fonctionnement (injection en flux), la bioélectrode et le bioréacteur piston sont des appareils qui doivent être calibrés et dont la biomasse immobilisée doit être préalablement adaptée à l'échantillon à analyser. La solution de calibration est essentielle et doit être qualitativement la plus proche possible de l'échantillon à analyser. Le bioréacteur parfaitement mélangé se distingue des deux premières méthodes car il travaille théoriquement en consommation totale du substrat. La méthode ne nécessite pas de calibration mais implique, avant toute mesure de respirogramme, la détermination d'un paramètre supplémentaire, le coefficient de transfert de l'oxygène. De manière générale, la principale conclusion de l'étude réside dans la difficulté de ces appareils à fournir une DO (Demande en oxygène) corrélable à la DBO 5 conventionnelle. Leur champ d'application reste en effet limité aux substrats rapidement biodégradables. Leurs potentialités restent cependant conformes aux besoins de contrôle rapide des charges organiques polluantes en entrée et sortie des stations d'épuration. BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) is {{an important}} parameter to characterize organic pollution in aquatic environments and sewage. The five-day period required by the classical dilution method (BOD 5) is incompatible with real-time control of a sewage treatment plant. Moreover, the assay procedure (closed respirometer, very diluted samples) is not only far from real growing conditions but also far from conditions in sewage treatment plants. Several devices for rapid BOD estimation, all based on respirometric methods, have been developed and tested. These devices can be grouped into 2 categories:- an immobilized biomass plug-flow reactor and a bioelectrode, both based on a flow injection principle; - an immobilized biomass perfectly mixed reactor, based on an open respirometer principle. We have focused mainly on validating the principles, checking the measurement reliability, and defining more precisely {{the scope of the}} various devices. The bioelectrodeThe BOD bioelectrode that we developed relies on a classical configuration that uses a yeast strain (Trichosporon cutaneum) as the biological receptor and a Clark probe as the transducer. The main changes made in this system are as follows:- a second biomembraneless Clark probe was added to the 16 -ml measuring cell to serve as a reference probe in order to remove experimental disturbances (temperature, oxygen transfer coefficient, dissolved oxygen concentration, etc.). - the second change was to include the respirogram area among the data available for processing. The signal utilized in this set-up is the difference between the signals provided by the two probes. Our conclusions are as follows:- Concerning the signal processing, manufacturers are currently guided by the desire to develop devices able to estimate the BOD of a large range of substrates or effluents {{in a very short time}} (a few minutes for the newest devices). However, it seems useful, even necessary in many cases (complex mixtures of components that are oxidized at variable rates), to use information provided by the respirogram shape and area. This approach allows one to maximize the BOD bioelectrode's range for a given immobilized strain, although the trade-off is a longer total run time. - Concerning the adaptation period for microorganisms, it is impossible to correctly estimate BOD from various effluents without first adapting the biomaterial to the type of substrate to be analyzed. Therefore it is dangerous to consider a BOD bioelectrode as an analytical instrument, because an adaptation period is required after any change in the composition or, even more so, type of effluent. - Concerning the correspondence between rapid BOD and BOD 5, the BOD sensor can detect only the BOD of soluble compounds that can diffuse through the biomembrane and that will be metabolized during the time of analysis. The difference observed between BOD sensor and BOD 5 depends on the calibration solution but also and even more on the structure and size of the molecules constituting the sample to be analyzed. - Concerning the choice of calibration solution, choosing the right calibration solution is crucial. The calibration solution should therefore be qualitatively as close as possible to the test sample. The immobilized biomass bioreactorsThe plug-flow reactorThe plug-flow reactor design was validated for simple substrates; its working principle is similar to the bioelectrodes, since it relies on flow-injection analysis (FIA). In the case of the plug-flow reactor, the only usable information for BOD estimation is the respirogram area, as the peak height quickly reaches a rather constant value due to saturation of the immobilized microorganisms. However, the importance of the many physical and biological processes that occur concomitantly in the system (transfer, adsorption, substrate consumption, substrate saturation phenomena, dilution rate, etc.) makes a theoretical mathematical model of the reactor more difficult to establish. A long-term, more fundamental study of various natural or artificial substrates might ultimately enable us to reach such a goal. On the other hand, a variant of this reactor that recirculates the partially-degraded effluent until it is completely consumed yielded a linear correlation between system response (respirogram area) and substrate amount. In this system, oxidation of the rapidly biodegradable substrates is total under our operating conditions. This alternative reactor seems to have some very interesting possibilities, especially with regard to the automation of the system. The perfectly mixed reactorThe utilization of the perfectly mixed reactor for rapid BOD estimation is based on two sequential experiments - although this has the disadvantage of increasing the total run time - to obtain the respirogram area (S) and oxygen transfer coefficient (KL. a), as the units of the product (KL. a x S) of these parameters are equivalent to those of oxygen demand and their product is the variable that best correlates with the substrate injection volume. This correlation was observed for a large range of substrates. In the case of the perfectly mixed reactor, unlike bioelectrodes,- diffusion processes have no effect on measurement, as the substrate is consumed completely during the experiment; - the substrate consumption rate does not affect the measurements, thereby freeing the method from the influence of various experimental parameters (<b>air</b> <b>flow-rate,</b> the quantity of biomass, the liquid volume in the reactor, etc.), as our tests have shown. For a given substrate, the linearity of the correlation between the product of KL. a x S and the amount of substrate is generally excellent. The attempt to correlate the system's response with the BOD 5 measurements for a variety of substrates proved to be difficult, however. Although the bioreactor's analytical range is wider than that of bioelectrodes, the system still fails to give any measurable responses for complex substrates such as starch, cellulose, proteins, etc., and the KL. a x S values estimated by the bioreactor remained much lower than the corresponding BOD 5 values. KL. a x S is probably characteristic of the portion of the substrate that is degraded rapidly by the microorganisms to meet their immediate energy needs, whereas the remaining substrate is probably kept for reserve and biomass synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Doctoral Dissertation for PhD {{degree in}} Chemical and Biological EngineeringThe biotechnological {{production}} of γ-decalactone (a peach-like aroma compound) by biotransformation of ricinoleic acid {{carried out by}} microorganisms is an interesting process to produce the aroma with a “natural” label, which is valuable, considering the preference of consumers. Although there are many works described in the literature about this subject, several factors in the process remain to fully understand and, consequently, to optimize. One of these factors {{is the effect of}} oxygen in the overall process. Thus, this work initially aimed to study the oxygen mass transfer phenomenon from gas to the biotransformation medium, an oil-in-water emulsion stabilized by a non-ionic surfactant, Tween 80. The oil is simultaneously the substrate of the process and it works as an oxygen carrier, since the solubility of this compound is higher in the oil than in the aqueous phase. The influence of each operation parameter (aeration rate and presence and concentration of surfactant agent and organic phase) on the variables involved in the oxygen transfer (gas-liquid interfacial area, a; liquid-side mass transfer coefficient, kL; and volumetric mass transfer coefficient, kLa) was analyzed in a bubble column and in an airlift reactor. Results demonstrated that in the bubble column the increase of aeration rates is positive for both gas-liquid interfacial area and mass transfer due to the increase of turbulence and gas hold-up. The surfactant concentration had a positive effect on the interfacial area since it reduced the gas bubbles size and it had a negative effect upon kL because its molecules are located at the gas-liquid interface, obstructing the oxygen mass transfer. Regarding the oil concentration, it had a negative effect upon the interfacial area but it improved kL, since it causes a new distribution of surfactant in the medium, decreasing its concentration in the gas-liquid interface. The overall result was a negative effect of the organic phase upon kLa. In the airlift reactor, it was observed that the increase of the aeration rates had a negative effect on kL. This was attributed to differences in the liquid distribution inside the airlift reactor. Since the main goal of this work was to optimize the production of γ-decalactone, two different ricinoleic acid sources (methyl ricinoleate, MR, and castor oil, CO) were tested, in different concentrations, as substrates of the process. Moreover, different cell inoculation strategies were attempted, differing among each other in the washing or not of the cells. The results revealed that the use of non-washed cells is more beneficial for the aroma production, independently of the substrate used; and a concentration of 30 g L- 1 MR was the most adequate among the range tested, since it allowed the highest γ-decalactone productivity (14. 9 mg L- 1 h- 1). This substrate revealed also to be a lipase inducer. The use of CO as substrate of the process allowed to achieve almost 2 g L- 1 of aroma but the process was rather slow, resulting in low productivities. It was then hypothesized an insufficient oil hydrolysis and an enzymatic hydrolysis was attempted with different commercial enzymes and operating conditions (temperature and pH). Lipozyme TL IM, pH 8 and 27 °C were selected as the most efficient lipase and operating conditions, respectively, to hydrolyze CO. The results obtained using CO previously hydrolyzed by the selected lipase were compared with the results obtained in experiments in which the enzymatic hydrolysis occurred during the biotransformation and in experiments without adding lipase, indicating that the process was faster when lipase was involved in any form, but the aroma concentrations were lower, resulting in similar productivities. The droplets size of both oils was characterized by laser granulometry in emulsions with different oil concentrations. The impact of the presence of cells on droplets size was also analyzed as well as the relevance of washing inoculum cells. The granulometry of emulsions was related with γ-decalactone production and it was observed that, in the presence of non-washed cells, the smaller droplets disappeared, with both oils, which increased γ-decalactone concentration, suggesting that the access of cells to the substrate occurs by their adhesion around larger oil droplets. Experiments in a stirred bioreactor using 30 g L- 1 MR (concentration at which the highest aroma productivity was achieved) and different aeration and agitation rates demonstrated the direct influence of oxygen transfer rate on the production of γ-decalactone and of another compound, 3 -hydroxy-γ-decalactone, that can also accumulate in the medium. The accumulation of this compound indicates a deviation in the metabolic pathway of γ-decalactone production, decreasing its yields. A response surface methodology was used to optimize pH (6. 17) and dissolved oxygen concentration (44. 4 %) for the aroma production. These operating conditions were applied in two fed-batch strategies: with constant medium feeding rate and with intermittent feeding. Both strategies were compared with the traditional batch mode in terms of overall productivity and yield in respect to the substrate. Although the productivity was considerably higher in the batch mode, the level of substrate conversion to both lactones was greater in the intermittent fed-batch, allowing the accumulation of high aroma concentrations (6. 8 g L- 1 γ-decalactone and 10. 0 g L- 1 3 -hydroxy-γ-decalactone). Finally, the production of aroma was attempted in an airlift bioreactor due to the advantages of this type of bioreactor, mainly in terms of high power economies, the non-mechanical agitation which avoids damage to cells and the higher mass transfer coefficients attained. The highest γ-decalactone production was obtained at an <b>air</b> <b>flow-rate</b> of 1 L min- 1. The aeration rate increase of 5 -fold lead to lower aroma concentrations. However, the time needed to reach the peak of production was also reduced, resulting in higher productivities. A produção biotecnológica de γ-decalactona (composto com aroma a pêssego) através da biotransformação de ácido ricinoleico por microrganismos é um processo interessante para produzir o aroma com um rótulo de “natural”, o que é uma mais-valia, considerando as actuais preferências dos consumidores. Embora existam muitos trabalhos na literatura sobre este tema, vários factores do processo ainda permanecem por compreender totalmente e, consequentemente, por optimizar. Um desses factores é o efeito do oxigénio no processo global. Assim, este trabalho teve inicialmente como objectivo estudar o fenómeno de transferência de O 2 do gás para o meio de biotransformação, uma emulsão do tipo óleo-em-água estabilizada pelo surfactante não-iónico Tween 80. O óleo é simultaneamente o substrato do processo e actua também como transportador de O 2, uma vez que a solubilidade deste composto no óleo é maior do que na fase aquosa. A influência de cada parâmetro de operação (arejamento, presença e concentração de surfactante e fase orgânica) nas variáveis envolvidas na transferência de O 2 (área interfacial gás-líquido, a; coeficiente de transferência de O 2 na fase líquida, kL; e coeficiente volumétrico de transferência de massa, kLa) foi analisada numa coluna de bolhas e num reactor airlift. Os resultados demonstraram que na coluna de bolhas o aumento da taxa de arejamento é positivo tanto para a área interfacial como para a transferência de massa devido ao aumento da turbulência e do gás hold-up. A concentração de surfactante teve um efeito positivo na área interfacial, uma vez que reduziu o tamanho das bolhas de gás e teve um efeito negativo no kL porque as suas moléculas localizam-se na interface gás-líquido, dificultando a transferência de O 2. Relativamente à concentração de óleo, esta teve um efeito negativo na área interfacial mas melhorou o kL, uma vez que provocou uma nova distribuição do surfactante no meio, diminuindo a sua concentração na interface gás-líquido. O resultado global foi um efeito negativo da fase orgânica no kLa. No reactor airlift, observou-se que o aumento do arejamento produziu um efeito negativo no kL. Este resultado foi atribuído às diferenças na distribuição do líquido dentro do reactor airlift. Como o principal objectivo deste trabalho era optimizar a produção O uso de OR como substrato do processo permitiu obter quase 2 g L- 1 de aroma mas o processo foi bastante lento, resultando em baixas produtividades. Hipotetizou-se então uma insuficiente hidrólise do óleo e testou-se uma hidrólise enzimática com diferentes enzimas comerciais e condições operatórias (temperatura e pH). Lipozyme TL IM, pH 8 e 27 °C foram seleccionadas, respectivamente, como a enzima e as condições operatórias mais eficientes na hidrólise do OR. Os resultados obtidos usando OR previamente hidrolisado pela enzima seleccionada foram comparados com os resultados obtidos em ensaios em que a hidrólise enzimática ocorreu durante a biotransformação e em ensaios em que não se adicionou lipase, indicando que o processo foi mais rápido quando a lipase esteve envolvida de alguma forma, mas as concentrações de aroma foram inferiores, resultando em produtividades idênticas. O tamanho das gotas de ambos os óleos em emulsões com diferentes concentrações de óleo foi caracterizado por granulometria laser. O impacto da presença de células no tamanho das gotas também foi analisado, assim como a relevância de se lavarem as células do inóculo. A granulometria das emulsões foi relacionada com a produção de γ-decalactona e observou-se que, na presença de células não lavadas, as gotas mais pequenas desapareceram, com ambos os óleos, aumentando a produção do aroma e sugerindo que o acesso das células ao substrato ocorre pela sua adesão à volta das gotas de óleo de maior tamanho. Ensaios num bioreactor agitado com 30 g L- 1 RM (concentração à qual se obteve a maior produção de aroma) e diferentes arejamentos e agitações demonstraram a directa influência da taxa de transferência de oxigénio na produção de γ-decalactona e de outro composto, a 3 -hidroxi-γ-decalactona, que também pode acumular no meio. A acumulação deste composto indica um desvio na via metabólica de produção de γ- decalactona, diminuindo o rendimento. A metodologia de superfície de resposta foi utilizada para optimizar o pH (6. 17) e a concentração de O 2 dissolvida no meio (44. 4 %) na produção do aroma. Estas condições foram aplicadas em duas estratégias semi-contínuas: com alimentação contínua de meio e com alimentação intermitente. Ambas as estratégias foram comparadas com o modo descontínuo tradicional em termos de produtividade global e rendimento em relação ao substrato. Embora a produtividade fosse consideravelmente superior no modo descontínuo, o nível de conversão de substrato em lactonas foi superior na estratégia semi-contínua intermitente, acumulando-se elevadas concentrações de aroma (6. 8 g L- 1 γ-decalactona e 10. 0 g L- 1 3 -OH-γ-decalactona). Por fim, a produção de aroma foi testada num bioreactor airlift devido às vantagens deste tipo de reactor, nomeadamente no que diz respeito à poupança energética, à agitação não mecânica que evita danos nas células e aos elevados coeficientes de transferência de massa que se obtêm. A maior produção de γ- decalactona foi obtida com um caudal de arejamento de 1 L min- 1. O aumento do caudal de arejamento em 5 vezes resultou numa diminuição da concentração do aroma. Porém, o tempo necessário para se atingir o pico de produção também foi reduzido, resultando em produtividades mais elevadas...|$|E
