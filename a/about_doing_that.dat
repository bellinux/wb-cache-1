500|$|For the {{research}} facility at [...] "Taskerlands", Kneale {{was influenced by}} a visit he had paid to the BBC's research and development facility which was based at an old country house at Kingswood Warren in Kingswood, Surrey. Similarly, {{the research}}ers working at Kingswood Warren influenced the portrayal {{of the members of}} the Ryan research team in The Stone Tape. Kneale recalled of his visit to Kingswood Warren, [...] "The sort of impression you got of the folk who worked there was a boyishness. [...] They were very cheerful. It was all rather fun for them, which is a very clever way to go <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> sort of heavy research... They were nice chaps– and so we got some very nice chaps for the TV version".|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, Pearl Jam {{went for}} a two-week session at Henson. It {{was the first time}} the band spent a {{considerable}} amount of time recording outside of Seattle since 1996's No Code. McCready said, [...] " [...] we got together with Ed and it really started getting more cohesive, we took that momentum down to Los Angeles with Brendan... It was a great idea to get us out of Seattle. You've gotta get out [...] your comfort zone, and we've talked <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> for the past ten years and kind of haven't, so we trusted Brendan's judgment." [...] In April 2009, the band {{went for a}} two-week session to finish the album with O'Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. The album took a total of thirty days in the studio to get finished, and O'Brien stated [...] "we had 90% of the record cut in the first nine days".|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009 Alkaline Trio {{announced}} {{the formation of}} their own independent record label, created as {{a joint venture with}} Epitaph Records {{in a manner similar to}} ANTI- and Hellcat Records. Epitaph had previously released Patent Pending, the 2006 album by Skiba's side project Heavens. Named Heart & Skull after Alkaline Trio's logo, the new label would be inaugurated by the release of their new album. Skiba remarked that [...] "We made the decision to form Heart & Skull to put out our own records after having been through every kind of label deal in the industry, big indies, small indies, majors. We knew it was time to adapt to the shifting tides of the music industry and we could not be more thrilled <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> in conjunction with the team at Epitaph." [...] Singer and bassist Dan Andriano added: [...] "For our band at this time it really makes sense to release our own records, but we wanted to make sure we could partner up with good people who we would want to share in something very special to us. When Brett [...] called and said he wanted to be involved, that was it. Epitaph is a label I've admired and supported for more than half of my life." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps it is, {{where there}} is {{actually}} tyranny, and for a very obvious reason. One tyrant is sooner satisfied than a million, and has even {{a greater sense of}} responsibility. I can easily conceive that the Czar himself, if disposed to be a tyrant, which I am far from thinking to be the case with Nicholas, might hesitate <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> under his undivided responsibility, which one of our majorities would do, without even being conscious of the oppression it exercised, or caring at all about it. But, on the whole, we do little of the last, and not in the least enough to counterbalance the immense advantages of the system." ...|$|E

60|$|Once at the elm, {{it was not}} so {{difficult}} to find the way across the marsh, as it was to reach that spot, coming FROM the chiente. As there were several elms scattered about in the centre of the marsh, the bee-hunter was fearful that he might not reach the right tree; in which case he would be compelled to retrace his steps, and that at the imminent hazard of being captured. He carried habitually a small dark lantern, and had thought of so disposing of it in the lower branches of this very elm, as to form a focus of it, but hesitated <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> which might prove a guide to his enemies as well as to himself. If Margery would take charge of this lantern, he could hope to reap its advantages without incurring the hazard of having a light suspended in the tree for any length of time. Margery understood the lessons she received, and promised to obey all the injunctions by which they were accompanied.|$|E
50|$|Red Bull {{have been}} very vocal about wanting to make F1 'fun' again. One {{way in which they}} went <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> was by {{employing}} Mark Gallagher, who was head of marketing for nine years at Jordan, itself an exciting brand in the late 1990s. Red Bull also started The Red Bulletin, a satirical magazine that is released four times per race weekend and distributed to the paddock and to members of the public from behind the main grandstand at each track.|$|E
5000|$|Some further overdubbing was scheduled, {{but with}} {{recording}} essentially finished, Arthur Baker {{was left to}} mix the album. [...] "I'm not too experienced at having records sound good," [...] said Dylan. [...] "I don't know how to go <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that.</b> With Arthur Baker...I just went out and recorded a bunch of stuff all over the place, {{and then when it}} was time to put this record together, I brought it all to him and he made it sound like a record." ...|$|E

5000|$|Asserting that Metal Gear Solid {{has always}} been a {{primarily}} metafictional series, Dave Thier of Forbes praised the game's substitution of a player-created avatar for Big Boss: [...] "It's not ending the actual plot - lord knows how anyone would actually go <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> - it's ending the game, and the series as well. You’ve made it through every mission, you've backtracked, perfected, gotten your S ratings and employed perfect stealth. That's it, you're Big Boss, you're Snake, You're 'you.' And you're done." [...] Chris Carter of Destructoid said that Venom Snake made sense {{within the context of the}} series, as the games have [...] "always dabbled in the concept of 'the legend' being stronger than the actual person", but suggested that a depiction of his death at the hands of Solid Snake (recreating the original Metal Gear from the villain's perspective) would have been a stronger ending.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{the release}} of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie in 2004, {{producer}} Julia Pistor stated that a sequel film was unlikely, despite the film's successful box office performance. In a 2009 interview with Digital Spy, SpongeBob SquarePants writer and executive producer Paul Tibbitt {{was asked about the}} possibility of a sequel. He said, [...] "I think that they are talking <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> but I haven't signed up for anything. We just feel like we've told so many stories, and SpongeBob exists so well in this short 11-minute form." [...] He further stated that making another film was [...] "a huge challenge." [...] However, Tibbitt denied that a sequel is not impossible to emerge, saying [...] "I wouldn't say no, but I don't know if there will be another one." [...] In 2010, Nickelodeon reportedly had been approaching the crews of the show to make another film adaptation. The network had long wanted to partner with Paramount Pictures to release another SpongeBob SquarePants film to help reinvigorate the series from its declining ratings. However, internal disagreement delayed collaborations.|$|E

5000|$|A third {{theme that}} {{is present in}} this book is that those who desire to grow spiritually will receive the help of God if they {{honestly}} have that desire. When talking to her mother before the parting, Ellen is determined to live a perfect, Christian life and be an example for everyone around her. However, {{as soon as she}} gets on the boat, she discovers that her heart holds negative feelings towards the people around her. After meeting the Christian man on the boat, she realizes how hard her heart is, and her desire to live a good life is rekindled. She fails at this again, however, when she gets to Aunt Fortune's house, where she directly disobeys her aunt and throws fits when things aren't done to her liking. But she realizes her mistakes and wants to be good, and God sends her a young woman who acts as a spiritual guide for the girl. Through this, Warner was telling people not to give up when they made mistakes, and showing how God comes to those who seek him. Since The Wide, Wide World is a Christian book, it aimed to teach readers how seek God and encourage those who didn’t exactly know how to go <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> but had a true desire to be closer to Him.|$|E
5000|$|Cradle's tenth studio album, The Manticore and Other Horrors, was {{released}} on 29 October 2012 in Europe, and on 30 October in North America. Paul Allender told Ultimate Guitar that [...] "The last thing {{we want to do}} is come out with another album that sounds like the last two. We decided to change direction and go back to what we used to do with the female vocals; all the strong melody lines and harmonies... I've put a lot of punk-orientated riffs back into it again. It's really gone quite dark and pretty hardcore." [...] Paul has been enthralled in his own project and he could not do the tour due to personal reasons. Since then the band has grown as a unit, we were only writing as one guitarist for the last three records and we now have two very competent guitarists. Paul had a very strong opinion <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> guitar parts solely, and we're a two-guitar band. So that may be one of the things that kind of opened the fissure a bit. — Dani Filth, on the split with longtime guitarist P.Allender in 2014 On 2 September 2013, via his monthly blog, Dani Filth announced the crowd-funded Cradle of Filth comic book, [...] "The Curse of Venus Aversa", and [...] "a career spanning double-disc 'best of'" [...] compilation that is yet to be named.|$|E
5000|$|Connolly {{summarized}} how {{the recording}} lineup fell into place:...we said we're {{just going to}} go in here and have fun with this. We had a bunch of songs lying around that we wanted to take in. Originally, it was just going to be me going in there and doing most everything. The more we talked about it and the more we got together a game plan and studio time, the more we kind of started talking about, [...] "Hey, Scott, remember ten years ago when we first talked <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> thing, that side project? Well, {{what are you doing in}} March?" [...] laughs Literally, it was pretty much that. Erock Friedman was like, [...] "Hey, man I want to get in on this." [...] I had already talked to Vinnie about doing it, because we knew that Sevendust members Morgan Rose and Clint Lowery were going to be doing Call Me No One. It literally came together, for lack of a better description and explanation for how it really happened. It wasn't like I sat down and said, here is my top fifty drummers that I'm going to go after, here's my top 25 guitar players — it wasn't that at all. It was just us saying, [...] "Hey, man, let's just go in and do what we always said we were going to do." [...] I think the end result at the end of the day surprised us just as much as it surprised everyone else.|$|E
