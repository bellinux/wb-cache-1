He used a very detailed website that allows people taking his class to fully understand every single day of lecture. Also, he was adamant <b>about</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> his undergraduates come prepared to discuss the material to be covered in class. This has twofold benefit, as it not only ensures preparation, but also allows students to boost their grade with frequent quizzes covering the reading material.|$|E

When asked if he and Loria had pulled off a [...] "Ponzi scheme" [...] by fleecing the public in the stadium deal and selling them back a [...] "sham" [...] a year later, Samson replied that the stadium is accomplishing its main purpose of keeping pro baseball in Miami. He drew comparisons to their former ownership of the (now relocated) Montreal Expos and Olympic Stadium:The difference in Montreal, there was no ballpark, there was no future.

[...] Schmid continued, [...] "I thought Evans did a really good job. Sometimes we were stretched in the midfield, but I thought he {{did a very good job}} of stepping up to Pável. When you look at the 90 minutes, it was a rare occasion that he was able to hit a ball behind our defense." [...] Chicago midfielder Logan Pause commented on the game saying, [...] "It’s disappointing. We came here to win. We were under the gun all night.

40|$|In {{the use of}} {{medication}} and pharmaceutical products, non‐compliance is a major problem. One {{thing we can do}} something <b>about</b> is <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> consumers have the information they need. This thesis investigates how remote communication technology can be used to improve the availability for expressive advice‐giving services. Special attention is given to the balancing of expressiveness and availability. A solution is presented that uses 3 D visualisation in combination with audio and video communication to convey advice on complex pharmaceutical products. The solution is tested and evaluated in two user studies. The first study is broad and explorative, the second more focused and evaluative. The solution was well received by participating subjects. They welcomed the sense of personal contact that seeing the communicating party over video link produced and appreciated the expressive power and pedagogical value of the 3 D materials. Herbert Clark’s theory of use of language is suggested as a framework for the analysis of the dynamics of the relationship between consumer and advisor. Report code: LiU-Tek-Lic- 2008 : 31...|$|R

40|$|The {{vision and}} change {{initiative}} in life science education has charged universities with rethinking how undergraduate curriculum is presented and taught to students. For my Honors project, I designed and taught an innovative {{learning experience for}} freshman students in a pilot laboratory course. The course goals were to introduce and build basic microbiological, molecular genetic and biochemical engineering laboratory techniques, while empowering our students to undertake independent research in their first year. The topic of my module was plasmid isolation and optimization from E. coli, a technique that would reinforce the independent problem solving and wet-lab skills needed throughout {{the duration of the}} course. From the literature, I gathered information on the history of plasmids and surveyed how and why the protocols have changed over the years. I then tested six different historical protocols for plasmid isolation, dating from 1979 to 2011, readying them for the students’ use. In addition, I taught general information on plasmids and their history (e. g. discovery, current use, etc.). For two weeks, I {{was in charge of the}} laboratory, teaching the students <b>about</b> plasmids and <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> the students’ isolations and optimizations went smoothly.
