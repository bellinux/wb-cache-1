5|$|In {{addition}} to his duties as a professional herald, Brooke-Little held three administrative positions at the College of <b>Arms.</b> <b>From</b> 1974 until 1982, he served as Registrar, with responsibility to enter all new grants and confirmations of arms into the College records. Brooke-Little's signature {{can be found on}} the reverse of the letters patent for every grant made during this period. In addition, he served as the College's librarian from 1974 until 1994 and the treasurer of the College of <b>Arms</b> <b>from</b> 1978 until 1995. He was also the director of the Heralds' Museum at the Tower of London from 1991 to 1997; this museum is no longer operating. Although Brooke-Little enjoyed prominence as a professional officer of arms and as an author on heraldic subjects, his role in founding the Heraldry Society, and in guiding the society and editing its journal for many years, was perhaps his greatest contribution to the science of heraldry.|$|E
5|$|Angola {{agreed to}} trade oil to Slovakia {{in return for}} arms, buying six Sukhoi Su-17 attack {{aircraft}} on 3 April 2000. The Spanish government in the Canary Islands prevented a Ukrainian freighter from delivering 636tons of military equipment to Angola on 24 February 2001. The captain of the ship had inaccurately reported his cargo, falsely claiming the ship carried automobile parts. The Angolan government admitted Simportex had purchased <b>arms</b> <b>from</b> Rosvooruzhenie, the Russian state-owned arms company, and acknowledged the captain might have violated Spanish law by misreporting his cargo, a common practice in arms smuggling to Angola.|$|E

5|$|As a male-line {{grandchild}} of the British monarch, Victoria Melita {{bore the}} royal arms, with an inescutcheon for Saxony, the whole differenced by a label of five points argent, the outer pair bearing hearts gules, the inner pair anchors azure, {{and the central}} point a cross gules. In 1917, the inescutcheon was dropped by royal warrant. Her <b>arms</b> <b>from</b> that point on are duplicated {{in the arms of}} Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} Adventure, {{the player}} reaches an island called Maxwell's Island with a hall {{belonging}} to Maxwell on it. The player finds Maxwell trapped in a throne encircled by short stone pillars. The player is at first unable to free him, but finds a keyhole, {{as well as a}} key nearby. The player sets Maxwell free, but he turns into a skeleton and disintegrates as soon as he stands up. The ghostly <b>arms</b> <b>from</b> the trailer then grab the player and ensnare them in the throne. An epilogue implies that the player will take on a villainous role similar to Maxwell's using newfound powers given by the throne, but will nonetheless be trapped forever.|$|E
5|$|Batista {{had come}} under {{increasing}} pressure by 1958. His army's military failures, coupled with his press censorship {{and the police}} and army's use of torture and extrajudicial executions, were increasingly criticized both domestically and abroad. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry, leading him to buy <b>arms</b> <b>from</b> the United Kingdom. The opposition used this opportunity to call a general strike, accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7. Beginning on 9 April, it received strong support {{in central and eastern}} Cuba, but little elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Destruction of the {{newspaper}} provoked a strident call to <b>arms</b> <b>from</b> Thomas C. Sharp, editor of the Warsaw Signal and longtime critic of Smith. Fearing an uprising, Smith mobilized the Nauvoo Legion on June 18 and declared martial law. Officials in Carthage responded by mobilizing their small detachment of the state militia, and Governor Thomas Ford appeared, threatening to raise a larger militia unless Smith and the Nauvoo city council surrendered themselves. Smith initially fled across the Mississippi River, but shortly returned and surrendered to Ford. On June 23, Smith and his brother Hyrum rode to Carthage to stand trial for inciting a riot. Once the Smiths were in custody, the charges were increased to treason.|$|E
5|$|Hungary {{recognised}} Croatian independence on 15 January 1992 (with {{the rest}} of the European Economic Community member states), and established diplomatic relations with Croatia three days later. During the Croatian War of Independence, Croatia obtained <b>arms</b> <b>from</b> several countries (including Hungary), despite a United Nations-imposed arms embargo. As of December 2011, Hungary and Croatia have 96 treaties and agreements in force regulating a wide range of activities and relations (including diplomatic, cultural, economic, energy, transport, education, minority and other issues). Furthermore, Hungary supported the Croatian NATO membership request and Croatian accession to the European Union.|$|E
5|$|In June 2006, the PSNI made arrests {{following}} an MI5 sting operation targeting a dissident republican gun smuggling plot. The RIRA {{had attempted to}} procure <b>arms</b> <b>from</b> France including Semtex and C-4 plastic explosives, SA-7 surface-to-air missiles, AK-47s, rocket launchers, heavy machine guns, sniper rifles, pistols with silencers, anti-tank weapons and detonators. On 30 June 2010, two of those arrested were found guilty following a trial by judge in Belfast. On 1 October 2010 one man was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for attempting to import weapons and explosives, while the other was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment for making a Portuguese property available {{for the purpose of}} terrorism.|$|E

5|$|Schwend {{was given}} two objectives: to {{exchange}} the counterfeit money for genuine Swiss francs or US dollars, and {{to assist with}} the funding of special operations, including buying black market <b>arms</b> <b>from</b> the Yugoslav Partisans then selling them to pro-Nazi groups in Southeast Europe. He also arranged for the counterfeit notes to pay the Turkish agent Elyesa Bazna—code named Cicero—for his work in obtaining secrets from the British ambassador in Ankara. Counterfeit notes with a face value of £100,000 were used to obtain information that helped to free the Italian leader Benito Mussolini in the Gran Sasso raid in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|Some 77 {{municipalities}} across eastern Australia {{have received}} grants of <b>arms</b> <b>from</b> the Crown since 1908, but only four include a black swan: Lake Macquarie (1970, supporter) and Queanbeyan (1980, supporter) in New South Wales, and Springvale (1976, supporter) and Sale (1985, supporters) in Victoria. These all {{indicate the presence}} of black swans in the municipal area. Campbelltown, New South Wales, has a white swan in the crest of its arms (1969), alluding to the arms of its namesake Campbell family.|$|E

On May 13, the battalion commander {{declared a state of emergency}} in the area from May 15 until further notice. He authorized his men to seize all necessary <b>arms</b> <b>from</b> the settlements and urged them to dig in and build fortifications as fast as possible, and to mobilize all the necessary work force to do so.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Pan-Asianism, met Japanese premier Count Terauchi and Count Okuma, a former premier, in an attempt to enlist support for the Ghadarite movement. Tarak Nath Das urged Japan to align with Germany, on the grounds that American war preparation could actually be directed against Japan. Later in 1915, Abani Mukherji— a Jugantar activist and associate of Rash Behari Bose— is also known to have tried unsuccessfully to arrange for <b>arms</b> <b>from</b> Japan.|$|E
5|$|The Munich {{coat of arms}} is verifiable from {{seals in}} 1239 and 1268. These seals show a monk in a gate, above which is in eagle, {{referring}} to the Bishop of Freising. The city belonged to him and this was probably derived from his coat of <b>arms.</b> <b>From</b> 1313, the city was in possession of the Wittelsbach Dukes and the eagle was replaced with a lion, {{a symbol of the}} old Bavarian and Palatine Wittelsbachs since the Fiefdom of Duke Ludwig in 1214.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many East Germans cut the coat of arms out of their flags, as Hungarians had done in 1956 and as Romanians would soon do during {{the fall of}} Ceaușescu. The {{widespread}} act of removing the coat of <b>arms</b> <b>from</b> the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as the area of the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, the Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the federal government, is to examine the consequences of the former East German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.|$|E
5|$|Fisher {{was born}} William August Fisher on July 11, 1903, in Benwell, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, the second son of Heinrich and Lyubov Fisher. Revolutionaries of the Tsarist era, {{his father was}} an ethnic German from Russia {{and his mother was}} of Russian descent. Fisher's father, a revolutionary activist, taught and {{agitated}} with Vladimir Lenin at Saint Petersburg Technological Institute. In 1896 he was arrested for sedition and sentenced to three years internal exile. As Heinrich Fisher had served a sentence for offences against the Russian state, he was forced to flee to the United Kingdom in 1901, the alternative being deportation to Germany or imprisonment in Russia for avoidance of military service. While living in the United Kingdom, Fisher's father, a keen Bolshevik, took part in gunrunning, shipping <b>arms</b> <b>from</b> the North East coast to the Baltic states.|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display.
