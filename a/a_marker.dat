40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} hydroxyphenyl propane (LIPE®) as <b>an</b> <b>marker</b> of fecal output in sheep, goats, chickens, ostriches, dairy cattle, equine, buffalo, and cattle species. Feces were carefully collected from the ground to avoid contamination put into polietilene bags and further weighed. LIPE® concentration in feces was determined using infrared spectroscopy. It was therefore necessary to create a standard curve; the concentration of LIPE® in an unknown sample is calculated by interpolation on the graph of the standard curve. The values for fecal output obtained using LIPE® as <b>an</b> <b>marker</b> were similar to those obtained by total feces collection. These studies thus validate LIPE® as <b>an</b> <b>marker</b> of fecal output. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>marker,</b> LIPE® is comparable to total feces collection in these species with a recovery rate ranging from 95. 8 to 106. 3 %. LIPE® can therefore be used to estimate fecal outpu...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBackground ă Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is {{the gold}} {{standard}} to help ă oncologists select the best cancer treatment for their older patients. ă Some authors {{have suggested that the}} concept of frailty could be a more ă useful approach in this population. We investigated whether frailty <b>ă</b> <b>markers</b> are associated with treatment recommendations in an ă oncogeriatric clinic. ă Methods ă This prospective study included 70 years and older patients with solid ă tumors and referred for an oncogeriatric assessment. The CGA included ă nine domains: autonomy, comorbidities, medication, cognition, nutrition, ă mood, neurosensory deficits, falls, and social status. Five frailty <b>ă</b> <b>markers</b> were assessed (nutrition, physical activity, energy, mobility, ă and strength). Patients were categorized as Frail (three or more frailty <b>ă</b> <b>markers),</b> pre-frail (one or two frailty markers), or not-frail (no <b>ă</b> frailty <b>marker).</b> Treatment recommendations were classified into two ă categories: standard treatment with and without any changes and ă supportive/palliative care. Multiple logistic regression models were ă used to analyze factors associated with treatment recommendations. ă Results ă 217 patients, mean age 83 years (+/- Standard deviation (SD) 5. 3), were ă included. In the univariate analysis, number of frailty <b>markers,</b> grip <b>ă</b> strength, physical activity, mobility, nutrition, energy, autonomy, ă depression, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Scale of Performance ă Status (ECOG-PS), and falls were significantly associated with final ă treatment recommendations. In the multivariate analysis, the number of <b>ă</b> frailty <b>markers</b> and basic Activities of Daily Living (ADL) were ă significantly associated with final treatment recommendations (p< 0. 001 ă and p = 0. 010, respectively). ă Conclusion <b>ă</b> Frailty <b>markers</b> are associated with final treatment recommendations in ă older cancer patients. Longitudinal studies are warranted to better ă determine their use in a geriatric oncology setting...|$|R
