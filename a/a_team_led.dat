5|$|The {{first of}} these {{planetary}} rings was detected in 1968 by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> by Edward Guinan. In the early 1980s, analysis of this data along with newer observations led to the hypothesis that this ring might be incomplete.|$|E
5|$|Cumberland's dismal winning {{percentage}} {{and the inability}} to field <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> to their disbanding {{at the end of}} the season. After only playing eight first-grade matches and one trial match, Cumberland ceased to exist and passed into history. Seven of the Cumberland players moved to neighbours Western Suburbs, although only Harry Bloomfield, A. Halling and S. Jarvis played first-grade rugby league again.|$|E

5|$|Al-Qaeda {{had begun}} reconnoitering Nairobi for {{potential}} targets in December 1993, using <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> by Ali Mohamed. In January 1994, bin Laden was personally {{presented with the}} team's surveillance reports, {{and he and his}} senior advisers began to develop a plan to attack the American embassy there. From February to June 1998, al-Qaeda prepared to launch their attacks, renting residences, building their bombs, and acquiring trucks; meanwhile, bin Laden continued his public-relations efforts, giving interviews with ABC News and Pakistani journalists. While U.S. authorities had investigated al-Qaeda activities in Nairobi, they had not detected any warnings of imminent attacks.|$|E
5|$|Doomsday is a 2008 {{science fiction}} action horror film written and {{directed}} by Neil Marshall. The film takes place in the future in Scotland, which has been quarantined because of a deadly virus. When the virus is found in London, political leaders send <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> by Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) to Scotland to find a possible cure. Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights. Doomsday was conceived by Marshall based on the idea of futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights. In producing the film, he drew inspiration from various movies, including Mad Max, Escape from New York and 28 Days Later.|$|E

Finds included postholes, two hearths including a metalworker's forge, two burials oriented north-south (thus {{unlikely to be}} Christian), fragments of 6th century Mediterranean amphorae (vases for wine or cooking oil), and a worn hollow bronze head which may have topped a Saxon staff.|$|E
5|$|In April 1970, <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> by Albert Ghiorso {{working at}} the University of California (Berkeley, California, United States) stepped into the competition. They claimed to have {{synthesized}} the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with nitrogen-15 ions. Alpha activity with the energy of 9.1MeV was formed; the team attempted reaction with other nuclides—bombardment of 249Cf with 14N, Pb with 15N, Hg with 15N—and stated no such activity was found in those reactions. The characteristics of the daughter nuclei correlated with those of 256103, implying the assignment of the parent to 260105.|$|E

Acetic acid has {{the distinction of being}} the first molecule discovered in the interstellar medium using solely radio interferometers; in all previous ISM molecular discoveries made in the millimetre and centimetre wavelength regimes, single dish radio telescopes were at least partly responsible for the detections.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes started {{teaching}} piano {{when he was}} 19. He dropped out of studying at the University of Southern California in 1929 to support his family through the Great Depression by full-time teaching. As a teacher, he designed a method that combined classical and jazz music, which became popular across the United States, and resulted in an hour-long nationally syndicated radio show. Rhodes continued to teach the piano through his lifetime, and the piano method continues to be taught today by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> by Joseph Brandsetter.|$|E

Styx is about half as bright as the dimmest previously known object in the system, Kerberos, and about one hundred thousandth as bright as Pluto. It was designated S/2012 (134340) 1, and informally referred to as P5.|$|E

5|$|The RaLa Experiment, or RaLa, was {{a series}} of tests during and after the Manhattan Project {{designed}} to study the behavior of converging shock waves to achieve the spherical implosion necessary for compression of the plutonium pit of the nuclear weapon. The experiment used significant amounts of a short-lived radioisotope lanthanum-140, a potent source of gamma radiation; the RaLa is a contraction of Radioactive Lanthanum. The method was proposed by Robert Serber and developed by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> by the Italian experimental physicist Bruno Rossi.|$|E
5|$|The game began {{development}} in 2012: the project began when Masaru Oyamada told series producer Koichi Ishii {{that he could}} create a legitimate entry in the Mana series for mobile platforms. His idea was for a game true to the series that would reach a wide audience. The game's multiplayer, inspired by that used in Secret of Mana, was developed using the Photon Server middleware. The art director was series newcomer Hiroyuki Suzuki, while the character and monster designs were done by Taiki and Ryota Murayama. The music was composed by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> by Tsuyoshi Sekito. The theme song was written and performed by singer-songwriter Kokia.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} the {{planetary}} orbit allowed {{the mass of the}} white dwarf star to be estimated as well, and theories of the formation of the planet suggested that the white dwarf should be young and hot. On July 10, 2003, the detection of the white dwarf and confirmation of its predicted properties were announced by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> by Steinn Sigurdsson, using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. It was at a NASA press briefing that the name Methuselah was introduced, capturing press attention around the world.|$|E

One of them was Nejc Zaplotnik, a notable climber of Slovenian origin. <b>A</b> Korean <b>team</b> reached the summit in the autumn of the same year. <b>A</b> German <b>team</b> <b>led</b> by G.

Korniszewski successfully followed the Tyrolean Route. In the spring season of 1984, <b>a</b> Yugoslav <b>team</b> <b>led</b> by <b>A.</b> Kunaver climbed the peak via the south face. During the same year, in autumn, Polish teams climbed the south ridge and south-east face. On January 12, 1984, Maciej Berbeka and Ryszard Gajewski of a Polish expedition made the first winter ascent via the normal route. On November 10, 1986, Jerzy Kukuczka and Artur Hajzer reached the summit via a new route, in Alpine style, with no supplementary oxygen. Before that both Kukuczka and Hajzer, and Carlos Carsolio made the first climb of the east summit of Manaslu.In 1986, <b>a</b> joint <b>team</b> from Poland and Mexico led by Kukuczka opened a new route along the east ridge, descending via the north-east face.|$|R
