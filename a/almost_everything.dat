5|$|The {{actions of}} both commanders have been {{extensively}} analyzed in this action. While Montcalm performed well during the battle, some tactical options escaped his notice, {{and some of}} his actions in preparing the defenses at Carillon are open to question. In contrast, <b>almost</b> <b>everything</b> Abercrombie did has been questioned. It is widely held among historians that he was an incompetent commander.|$|E

5|$|The Elves, {{particularly}} the Noldor, preoccupy themselves with various {{things such as}} smithwork, sculpture, music and other arts, and of course, what to eat. Males and females can do <b>almost</b> <b>everything</b> equally; however, the females often specialize in the arts of healing while the males go to war. This is {{because they believe that}} taking life interferes with the ability to preserve life. However, Elves are not stuck in rigid roles; females can defend themselves at need as well as males, and many males are skilled healers as well, such as Elrond.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone brought major {{damage to}} some islands in French Polynesia. Around 95% of the {{infrastructure}} in Maupiti was destroyed, including 77 homes, an airport, and a town hall. About 30% {{of the infrastructure}} in Bora-Bora was destroyed, as well as 309 homes and many yachts. Many roads were also damaged. <b>Almost</b> <b>everything</b> {{on the north side}} of the island was destroyed. However, no deaths were reported. The name Osea was retired after this usage of the name.|$|E
5|$|Justus was {{a member}} of the Gregorian mission sent to England by Pope GregoryI. <b>Almost</b> <b>everything</b> known about Justus and his career is derived from the early 8th-century Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum of Bede. As Bede does not {{describe}} Justus' origins, nothing is known about him prior to his arrival in England. He probably arrived in England with the second group of missionaries, sent at the request of Augustine of Canterbury in 601. Some modern writers describe Justus as one of the original missionaries who arrived with Augustine in 597, but Bede believed that Justus came in the second group. The second group included Mellitus, who later became Bishop of London and Archbishop of Canterbury.|$|E
5000|$|The de Braoses were {{loyal to}} King Richard I but grew in power under King John of England. The dynasty was in {{conflict}} with King John {{towards the end of}} his reign and <b>almost</b> lost <b>everything.</b>|$|R

5|$|The second sub-plot {{depicts the}} lives of Charles W. Grannis and Miss Anastasia Baker. Grannis and Baker are two elderly {{boarders}} who share adjoining rooms in the apartment complex where Trina and McTeague live. Throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met. They both sit close to their adjoining wall {{and listen to the}} other for company, so they know <b>almost</b> <b>everything</b> about each other. They finally meet and cannot hide their long-time feelings for each other. When they reveal their love, Grannis admits he has $5,000, making him just as rich as Trina. But this makes little difference to them. Eventually, they marry and a door connects their rooms.|$|E
5|$|These plugins {{are usually}} easy {{to install and}} can change <b>almost</b> <b>everything</b> in the game. Plugins can include new creatures, weapons, armor, quests, people, playable species, Easter eggs, stores, player-owned houses, cities, expand {{on the size of}} cities, and {{introduce}} new plotlines, and entire landmasses with {{some or all of the}} above. Organized projects, such as Tamriel Rebuilt and , attempt to recreate the originally envisioned Morrowind province and other parties of Tamriel, as seen in other The Elder Scrolls games. For example, there are interpretations of both Cyrodiil and Skyrim, the settings of later The Elder Scrolls games.|$|E
5|$|After the {{collapse}} of public enterprises during the late 1980s, privatisation became strongly popular. Menem privatised <b>almost</b> <b>everything</b> the state owned, except {{for a couple of}} banks. In terms of service there were indisputable improvements. For example, before the telephone privatisation, to get a new line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years, and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in the market. After privatisation the wait was reduced to less than a week. Productivity increased as investment modernised farms, factories and ports. However, in all cases, there were large outlays of employees. In addition, the process of privatisation was suspected of corruption in many cases. Ultimately, the privatised enterprises became private (rather than public) monopolies. Their tariffs on long-term contracts were raised in line with American inflation, even though prices in Argentina were falling.|$|E
6000|$|... "So long as {{you will}} come," [...] he replied, confidently, [...] "we will see about the rest. Do you know, Sara, it would <b>almost</b> spoil <b>everything</b> if I felt that this change in my life were to disturb--our friendship." ...|$|R

5|$|David and Cowan {{finally left}} Antibes in May 1940, sailing to Corsica {{and then to}} Sicily. They had reached the Strait of Messina when Italy entered the war on 10 June. They were {{suspected}} of spying and were interned. After 19 days in custody {{in various parts of}} Italy, they were allowed to cross the border into Yugoslavia, which at that point remained neutral and non-combatant. They had lost <b>almost</b> <b>everything</b> they owned—the boat, money, manuscripts, notebooks, and David's cherished collection of recipes. With the help of the British Consul in Zagreb, they crossed into Greece, and arrived in Athens in July 1940. By this time, David was no longer in love with her partner but remained with him from necessity. Cowan found a job teaching English on the island of Syros, where David learnt to cook with the fresh ingredients available locally. When the Germans invaded Greece in April 1941, the couple managed to leave on a civilian convoy to Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and {{articles}} took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone. By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the Oder River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the Rhine, he could no longer disguise the fact that defeat was inevitable. Berlin had {{little in the way of}} fortifications or artillery (or even Volkssturm units, 'civilian soldiers'), as <b>almost</b> <b>everything</b> had been sent to the front. Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward. He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose the confidence of his Führer.|$|E
5|$|Kanons story {{revolves}} around {{a group of}} five girls whose lives {{are connected to the}} same boy. Yuichi Aizawa is a second-year high school student who had visited the city where the story takes place seven years prior to Kanons beginning. The story opens on Wednesday January 6, 1999 when Yuichi arrives in the city and is very detached from it and its inhabitants. Prior to his return, it is decided that he is to stay with his first cousin, Nayuki Minase, and her mother, Akiko. After his long absence, Yuichi has forgotten <b>almost</b> <b>everything</b> except minor details of what happened seven years before and is in need of being reminded of what he left behind. Nayuki initially tries repeatedly to jog his memory, but is unsuccessful. Throughout the story, as he learns about the supernatural undertones of the city, Yuichi is reminded of the events of seven years ago.|$|E
50|$|Advance {{screenings}} {{were held}} throughout the Bible Belt in Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, Missouri, Tennessee, Florida, Kentucky, Virginia and Arkansas. Thomas Nelson published a novelization, Billy: The Untold Story of a Young Billy Graham and the Test of Faith that <b>Almost</b> Changed <b>Everything,</b> written by McKay and Ken Abraham.|$|R

5|$|The City of Miami {{responded to}} the {{hurricane}} by downplaying its effects and turning down aid. The Miami Herald declared {{two weeks after the}} storm that <b>almost</b> <b>everything</b> in the city had returned to normal. The governor supported the efforts to minimize the appearance of the destruction by refusing to call a special legislative session to appropriate emergency funds for relief. As a result, the American Red Cross was able to collect only $3million of $5million needed. The 1926 hurricane effectively ended the land boom in Miami, despite the attempts at hiding the effects. It also forced drainage commissioners to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the canals. A $20million plan to build a dike around Lake Okeechobee, to be paid by property taxes, was turned down after a skeptical constituency sued to stop it; more than $14million had been spent on canals and they were ineffective in taking away excess water or delivering it when needed.|$|E
5|$|The Iroquois {{signed the}} Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands {{south of the}} Ohio to the British. European {{expansion}} into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English, a third were Scotch-Irish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others. These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, <b>almost</b> <b>everything</b> was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles. Settlers {{had to deal with}} harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Planning for Dragon Quest II {{began in}} April 1986, {{a month before}} the release of the {{original}} Dragon Quest. With the system and memory map decided, they started development in early July. At the beginning of development, producer Yukinobu Chida asked director and programmer Koichi Nakamura for a definite release date, and he offhandedly set one. Then the development team was divided into two groups, with one designing the story, as well as the monsters, and one doing the programming. The initial deadline was set for early November, but the game ultimately suffered a small delay. The development team had finished programming <b>almost</b> <b>everything</b> {{by the time of the}} initial release and believed the game could be released by the end of that year. In the Japanese magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump, published on November 11, 1986, it was announced that the game would be released in late December. However, the developers found that the game was too difficult, so it was delayed for month to adjust the balance. They had to finish the final version in mid-December, which they did, and then rushed to deliver to Nintendo to make the physical game cartridges. The game was released on January 26, 1987.|$|E

60|$|The prince <b>almost</b> fainted: <b>everything</b> {{seemed to}} swim; {{and in one}} moment more he would have fallen stiff on the mountain-top, and the white head would have crawled over him, and the cold coils would have slipped over him and turned him to stone. And still the thing slipped up, from the chink under the mountain.|$|R
60|$|For {{some time}} Harry sat as if stunned. He had scarce given a thought {{to his friends}} since that night they had left, {{the affairs of the}} marquis and his wife, of their daughters, and of Victor de Gisons, <b>almost</b> {{excluding}} <b>everything</b> else. When he thought of the boys it had been as already in England, under the charge of du Tillet.|$|R

Ocean levels rose to heights [...] "scarcely ever known before" [...] and caused great devastation, Duff reported.|$|R
