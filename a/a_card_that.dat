5|$|On July 21, 2001, Santos defended against Antonio Margarito in <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>that</b> {{took place}} in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. This {{marked the first time}} that Santos fought a world title fight in Puerto Rico. At the moment of the fight Margarito was the {{mandatory}} challenger appointed by the World Boxing Organization, and it was televised on Showtime Too. The fight ended in at the 2:11 mark on the first round when the fight was stopped due to a large injury over Margarito's right eye, the cut caused by an accidental head butt. The fight was declared a no-contest and Santos retained the welterweight championship by default. Following the conclusion of the contest both competitors were visibly angered at the sudden conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Santos debuted as a {{professional}} on September 28, 1996 against Andre Hawthorne in Fort Worth, Texas, in a fight where he won by technical knockout in the first round.

50|$|The {{player that}} calls the initial trump suit plays <b>a</b> <b>card</b> {{and all other}} players must play <b>a</b> <b>card</b> of <b>that</b> suit if they have it. Highest card wins. If the player doesn't have <b>a</b> <b>card</b> of <b>that</b> suit but has <b>a</b> <b>card</b> of the trump suit, he/she may play <b>that</b> <b>card</b> and win unless another player plays <b>a</b> higher <b>card</b> of <b>that</b> suit. The trump suit cannot be played until a player is out of a suit and cuts the hand. If <b>a</b> <b>card</b> of neither suit is played, the player loses that hand. After the first hand, {{the call of the}} trump suit passes to the left.|$|R
5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) {{about the}} compass and he {{searches}} his records. He finds <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>that</b> supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the compass, and gives Emma this name. The card is {{revealed to be}} blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle the garage let alone twins. Emma {{has no choice but}} to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings that no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to dismiss it as nothing.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>that</b> allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E
5|$|Trinidad was {{subsequently}} scheduled {{to fight against}} Hacine Cherifi in a contest that he won by technical knockout in the fourth round. The event was part of <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>that</b> took place on May 11, 2002, and was organized in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Early {{in the first round}} Trinidad's strategy consisted of using his jab while Cherifi did not try to directly engage in the offensive. In the last minute of the round a punch by Trinidad hit Cherifi's chin leaving him disoriented, he followed this with a combination and scored a knockdown. In the second round, Trinidad displayed more boxing and was on the offensive by using combinations to the head and ribs. In the third Cherifi landed more punches than in the previous two, but Trinidad relied on throwing left jabs. One of his punches hit Cherifi's liver, followed by a punch to the jaw, making Cherifi fall to the floor. In the fourth, a series of combinations injured Cherifi, who collapsed to the floor twice, forfeiting the fight on the second occasion. Following this contest Trinidad announced his retirement, at the moment leaving the sport with a record of 41wins, one defeat, and 34wins by knockout.|$|E

25|$|A {{smaller number}} of illegal {{immigrants}} entered the United States legally using the Border Crossing Card, <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>that</b> authorizes border crossings into the U.S. for a set amount of time. Border Crossing Card entry accounts {{for the vast majority}} of all registered non-immigrant entry into the United States—148 million out of 179 million total—but there is little hard data as to how much of the illegal immigrant population entered in this way. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates the number at around 250,000–500,000.|$|E
25|$|Until 1958, no one {{had been}} able to {{successfully}} establish a revolving credit financial system in which a card issued by a third-party bank was being generally accepted by a large number of merchants, as opposed to merchant-issued revolving cards accepted by only a few merchants. There had been a dozen attempts by small American banks, but none of them were able to last very long. In September 1958, Bank of America launched the BankAmericard in Fresno, California, which would become the first successful recognizably modern credit card. This card succeeded where others failed by breaking the chicken-and-egg cycle in which consumers did not want to use <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>that</b> few merchants would accept and merchants did not want to accept <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>that</b> few consumers used. Bank of America chose Fresno because 45% of its residents used the bank, and by sending a card to 60,000 Fresno residents at once, the bank was able to convince merchants to accept the card. It was eventually licensed to other banks around the United States and then around the world, and in 1976, all BankAmericard licensees united themselves under the common brand Visa. In 1966, the ancestor of MasterCard was born when a group of banks established Master Charge to compete with BankAmericard; it received a significant boost when Citibank merged its own Everything Card, launched in 1967, into Master Charge in 1969.|$|E
25|$|Calderón was {{successful}} {{on his first}} light flyweight title defense when he defeated Juan Esquer in <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>that</b> took place on December 1, 2007 in New Mexico. During {{the course of the}} fight Esquer was more active offensively. During the first four rounds of the match Calderón used his boxing skills to avoid being hit by the punches thrown by Esquer. From the fifth round onwards Calderón proceeded to exchange combinations of punches with Esquer, eventually gaining control of the fight's tempo. The fight lasted twelve rounds and Iván won the fight by unanimous decision with the judges awarding scores of 116-112, 118-110 and 115-113. Calderón's second defense in the light flyweight division took place on April 4, 2008, where he defeated Nelson Dieppa by unanimous decision. The three judges awarded him identical scores of 120-108.|$|E
