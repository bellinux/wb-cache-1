In the Mareshah onomasticon, the Qedarites are listed as <b>an</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> whose name in Aramaic transliteration is QDRYN.|$|E

5|$|According to the Yugoslav {{census of}} 1931, the {{population}} of eastern Herzegovina comprised 4 per cent Croats, 28 per cent Muslims, and 68 per cent Serbs. According to Professor Jozo Tomasevich, the estimated population of the districts of Bileća, Gacko and Nevesinje was only around 1.1 per cent Croat, so in those areas nearly all the NDH government appointments and local Ustaše units were staffed by Muslims, <b>an</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> that made up about 23.7 per cent of the local population. The poor Muslim peasants of eastern Herzegovina largely sided with the Ustaše. The NDH government immediately tried to strengthen their position by vilifying the Serbs, who, according to Tomasevich, comprised around 75 per cent of the population.|$|E

The true origin of ethnic Malays is still the subject of studies among historians, anthropologists and linguists. A popular theory suggested that the people who spoke Austronesian languages first arrived in Maritime Southeast Asia between 2,500BCE and 1,500BCE, as a part of Austronesian expansion from Taiwan to South East Asia.|$|E
5|$|The Dogon {{people are}} <b>an</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> in Mali, West Africa, {{reported}} by some researchers to have traditional astronomical knowledge about Sirius {{that would normally}} be considered impossible {{without the use of}} telescopes. In 1938 Marcel Griaule produced his dissertation and received his doctorate degree from the École pratique des hautes études (EPHE) based on his research work with the Dogon. According to Griaule's books Conversations with Ogotemmêli 1965 and The Pale Fox 1972 they knew about the fifty-year orbital period of Sirius and its companion prior to western astronomers. They also refer to a third star accompanying Sirius A and B. Robert Temple's 1976 book The Sirius Mystery, credits them with knowledge of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn.

25|$|Furthermore, ethnic mass {{mobilization}} {{is likely}} to be plagued by collective action problems, especially if ethnic protests are likely to lead to violence. Instrumentalist scholars have tried to respond to these shortcomings. For example, Hardin argues that ethnic mobilization faces problems of coordination and not collective action. He points out that a charismatic leader acts as a focal point around which members of <b>an</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> coalesce. The existence of such an actor helps to clarify beliefs about the behavior of others within <b>an</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
