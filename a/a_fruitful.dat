5|$|This period, {{between the}} eighth and the 10th centuries, saw a {{tripartite}} {{struggle for the}} resources of the rich Gangetic plains, each of these three empires annexing the seat of power at Kannauj for short periods of time. At their peak the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta ruled a vast empire stretching from the Ganges River and Yamuna River doab in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, <b>a</b> <b>fruitful</b> time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions. The early kings of this dynasty were influenced by Hinduism and the later kings by Jainism.|$|E
5|$|In the 1925–26 season Johnson {{reached the}} 20 goal mark {{for the first}} time, despite playing in a side {{struggling}} {{at the bottom of}} the division. Though the team endured a difficult league season, some of their wins were high scoring, including a record 6–1 Manchester derby win in which Johnson made a goalscoring appearance. The FA Cup proved <b>a</b> <b>fruitful</b> competition for the club that season, as they reached the final, scoring 31 goals in six matches. Johnson played in every cup match, scoring his first competitive hat-trick in the quarter-final, against Clapton Orient. However, Johnson's appearance at Wembley was not a happy one, his Manchester City team losing the final 1–0 to Bolton Wanderers. To compound the disappointment, City lost their final league game and were relegated to the Second Division. Three weeks after the end of the season Johnson made his debut for England, scoring in a 5–3 win against Belgium. Johnson played 5 times for England and scored five goals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Delius began <b>a</b> <b>fruitful</b> {{association}} with German supporters of his music, the conductors Hans Haym, Fritz Cassirer and Alfred Hertz at Elberfeld, and Julius Buths at Düsseldorf. Haym conducted Over the Hills and Far Away, which he gave under its German title Über die Berge in die Ferne on 13 November 1897, {{believed to be}} the first time Delius's music was heard in Germany. In 1899 Hertz gave a Delius concert in St. James's Hall in London, which included Over the Hills and Far Away, a choral piece, Mitternachtslied, and excerpts from the opera Koanga. This occasion was an unusual opportunity for an unknown composer at a time when any sort of orchestral concert was a rare event in London. In spite of encouraging reviews, Delius's orchestral music was not heard again in an English concert hall until 1907.|$|E

5|$|Nutter then enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>fruitful</b> two-year spell at Grays Athletic, and {{was part}} of the side that won the Conference South title, as well as two FA Trophy successes. In May 2006, he signed for Stevenage Borough, and again tasted FA Trophy success during the 2006–07 season. Nutter moved back into the Football League in November 2007, signing for Gillingham. He spent three-and-a-half seasons there, with the club moving between League One and League Two during his tenure. He was {{released}} when his contract expired {{at the end of the}} 2010–11 campaign, subsequently signing for Lincoln City of the Conference National in July 2011. He was loaned out to Woking in November 2012, a move that was later made permanent in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Laboratory {{had been}} <b>a</b> <b>fruitful</b> and {{successful}} international venture, although the Canadians had on occasion been resentful of British actions that {{were perceived as}} high-handed and insensitive. One such action came in November 1945 when the British government suddenly announced that Cockcroft had been appointed {{the head of the}} new Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Britain without any prior consultation {{and at a time when}} the NRX reactor was still under construction. Cockcroft did not depart Canada until September 1946, but it was a sure sign of waning British interest in collaboration with Canada. The British suggested he be replaced by the British physicist Bennett Lewis, who was eventually appointed, but only after the Canadian-born Walter Zinn turned the job down.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of probabilistic methods in graph theory, {{especially in the}} study of Erdős and Rényi of the asymptotic probability of graph connectivity, gave rise to yet another branch, known as random graph theory, which has been <b>a</b> <b>fruitful</b> source of graph-theoretic results.|$|E

25|$|During {{the twentieth}} century this was <b>a</b> <b>fruitful</b> area of {{combinatorial}} mathematics, with numerous connections to other fields.
