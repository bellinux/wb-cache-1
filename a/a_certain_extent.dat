Smolensk was the capital of the Commonwealth's Smoleńsk Voivodeship, but it had often been contested, and it changed hands many times during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries (from the days of the Muscovite-Lithuanian Wars). A major supporter of the war was the Tsar's father, Patriarch Filaret, who represented the anti-Polish camp at court.

5|$|The first {{ships were}} {{designed}} {{around the time}} of the Vietnam War, and certain aspects of the design were influenced by operations there. To <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>extent,</b> the carrier operations in Vietnam demonstrated the need for increased capabilities of aircraft carriers over their survivability, as they were used to send sorties into the war and were therefore less subject to attack. As a result of this experience, Nimitz carriers were designed with larger stores of aviation fuel and larger magazines in relation to previous carriers, although this was partly as a result of increased space available by the new design of the ships' propulsion systems.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Żydokomuna {{continued}} to endure to <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>extent</b> in postwar Poland (1944–1956), because Polish anti-communists saw the Soviet-controlled Communist regime as the fruition of prewar anti-Polish agitation; with it came {{the implication of}} Jewish responsibility. The Soviet appointments of Jews to positions responsible for oppressing the populace further fueled this perception. Some 37.1% of post-war management of UB employees {{and members of the}} communist authorities in Poland were of Jewish origin. They were described in intelligence reports as very loyal to the Soviets (Szwagrzyk). Some Polish historians have impugned the loyalty of Jews returning to Poland from the USSR after the Soviet takeover, which has raised the specter of Żydokomuna in the minds of other scholars.|$|E

5|$|As {{the player}} makes choices {{throughout}} the game, the gameplay's plot is revealed. Besides affecting dialogue and story developments, {{the outcome of}} entire scenes (and in some cases, the outcome of scenes several chapters later) can be manipulated to <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>extent</b> based on player choices. These choices are typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform. Examples of choice-based outcomes are the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can jeopardize the mission by forcing {{one of the guards}} to commit suicide. Choices also determine the finale of Beyond: Two Souls, as any number of possible plot endings can be experienced by the player.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>extent,</b> have {{control over their own}} health and well-being. They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Underground {{pipelines}} are {{blood vessels}} of a city. However, ongoing urban drain pipe accidents, especially the urban flooding accidents hit cities in recent years. One important reason {{is lack of}} mastery of underground pipeline information and its operation condition in cities and necessary urban underground drain pipeline information as decision support for planning and management. This leads to loss of scientific and rational evaluation of urban drain pipelines and eventually results in urban planning and construction to <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> unbridled <b>extent.</b> This paper addresses the construction and application of Kunming's urban drain pipeline information model to scientifically simulate and rationally analyze the urban underground drain pipeline capacity. The study results have positive effect in promoting scientific planning and construction of urban drain pipelines. ...|$|R

Crop monitoring {{during the growing season}} by means of optical remote sensing can provide information on plant variables that describe the actual status of agricul-tural crops during the growing season. In this paper, the assessment of crop vitality through analysis of both field and laboratory measurements of biophysical and biochemical parameters is investigated for wheat and barley, two main crops grown in Swit-zerland, be it by yield or by area. Leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radia-tion (FAPAR), water content and chlorophyll content are defined as the main parameters defining plant vitality. ...|$|R
60|$|We {{have seen}} {{that the study of}} the theory of {{expression}} confirms to <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> limited <b>extent</b> the conclusion that man is derived from some lower animal form, and supports the belief of the specific or sub-specific unity of the several races; but as far as my judgment serves, such confirmation was hardly needed. We have also seen that expression in itself, or the language of the emotions, as it has sometimes been called, is certainly of importance for the welfare of mankind. To understand, as far as possible, the source or origin of the various expressions which may be hourly seen on the faces of the men around us, not to mention our domesticated animals, ought to possess much interest for us. From these several causes, we may conclude that the philosophy of our subject has well deserved the attention which it has already received from several excellent observers, and that it deserves still further attention, especially from any able physiologist.|$|R

50|$|Although {{much work}} remains {{yet to be}} done, {{it is clear that}} Nepalese Sign Language is not used {{natively}} by the overwhelming majority of deaf people in Nepal. There are a number of reasons for this. The main reason, however, is that, as with hearing Nepalese, the majority of deaf in Nepal live in villages, surrounded by non-signing hearing population and not in contact with NSL users. Since the overwhelming majority of deaf children in Nepal as in all countries are born into hearing families without a single signing member, Nepalese Sign Language is primarily learned first at schools for the deaf. However, as these schools are few in number, and not readily accessible to most, it can be concluded that most deaf Nepalese have no opportunity to acquire Nepalese Sign Language under normal circumstances. (To <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> small <b>extent,</b> the National Deaf Federation Nepal, in programs funded by the Swedish Deaf Association (SDR), Deaf Way-UK and other funders, sends trained deaf sign language instructors to remote villages to teach deaf there (and their families and fellow villagers) the basics of Nepalese Sign Language.
