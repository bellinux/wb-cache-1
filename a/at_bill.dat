5|$|At a {{party in}} honor of Robert Novak, which is being thrown by John McCain and Jack Bauer, Jack Donaghy meets C.C., the Democratic congresswoman for Vermont. After the party, Jack and C.C. go back to Jack's {{apartment}} and have sex together. The following morning, Jack discovers that C.C. is suing the Sheinhardt Wig Company, the fictional subsidiary of General Electric (GE) and owner of NBC, the company that Jack works for. This is because the company is allegedly leaking Auburn Fantasy Dye Number 260 into the Chicktaugua River, causing the children of Chickataugua to turn orange. After discovering that Jack works for GE, C.C. leaves and goes to work <b>at</b> <b>Bill</b> Clinton's office in Harlem. Jack and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), follow her there and Jack and C.C. decide to carry on their relationship in secret.|$|E
5|$|Following her {{departure}} from parliament at the 2013 election, Gillard has remained engaged with the Labor Party. After Labor's defeat {{at the federal}} election held in September 2013, Gillard penned an op-ed for Guardian Australia, wherein she wrote about her legacy and how she believes the Labor Party ought to rebuild. In June 2015, Gillard participated in Sarah Ferguson's The Killing Season, a three-part documentary series which chronicles {{the events of the}} Rudd–Gillard years in power. The television series featured in-depth interviews with key Labor Party officials during the Rudd–Gillard Governments. Prior to the 2016 election campaign, Gillard offered her assistance to the Labor party, whereby a video was released of her endorsing and seeking donations for the party's education policy. She later joined former Labor Prime Ministers Bob Hawke and Paul Keating <b>at</b> <b>Bill</b> Shorten's Labor campaign launch on 19 June 2016.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} festival, the Experience were booked {{for a series}} of five concerts <b>at</b> <b>Bill</b> Graham's Fillmore, with Big Brother and the Holding Company and Jefferson Airplane. The Experience {{outperformed}} Jefferson Airplane during the first two nights, and replaced them {{at the top of the}} bill on the fifth. Following their successful West Coast introduction, which included a free open-air concert at Golden Gate Park and a concert at the Whisky a Go Go, the Experience were booked as the opening act for the first American tour of the Monkees. They requested Hendrix as a supporting act because they were fans, but their young audience disliked the Experience, who left the tour after six shows. Chandler later admitted that he engineered the tour in an effort to gain publicity for Hendrix.|$|E

25|$|This tour {{is notable}} {{for the fact}} that Led Zeppelin were the first pop act to perform at the prestigious Carnegie Hall in New York City since the Rolling Stones in the mid-1960s, and also for their three {{performances}} <b>at</b> <b>Bill</b> Graham's Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco (the alternate venue offered to those bands which pulled crowds too large for the smaller Fillmore West venue).|$|E

25|$|Black-footed smallish marine shags of Europe and {{southern}} Africa. Wahlberg's cormorant is very tentatively placed here; it seems anatomically {{more similar to}} the P. fuscscens, but the more informative characters – the combination of frontal crest and lack of extensive naked skin <b>at</b> <b>bill</b> base in mid-sized Old World species – seem to place it here. If this is correct, they are probably very distantly related due to biogeography.|$|E
25|$|Many {{expected}} that CP/M {{would be the}} standard operating system for 16-bit computers. In 1980 IBM approached Digital Research, <b>at</b> <b>Bill</b> Gates' suggestion, to license a forthcoming version of CP/M for its new product, the IBM Personal Computer. Upon the failure to obtain a signed non-disclosure agreement, the talks failed, and IBM instead contracted with Microsoft to provide an operating system. The resulting product, MS-DOS, soon began outselling CP/M.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors in encouraging industrial growth in the area was the opening of the Blisworth to Peterborough Railway (the Northampton and Peterborough Railway) in 1845. Operated by the London and North Western Railway Company (LNWR), it became a very busy line with stations <b>at</b> <b>Billing</b> Road, west of Cogenhoe, and Castle Ashby (Castle Ashby & Earls Barton railway station), east of Whiston. Many local men worked on the line as plate-layers, signalmen and porters, and the busy goods yard <b>at</b> <b>Billing</b> dispatched agricultural produce and boots and shoes out to the larger centres and accepted coal, fertiliser and many other goods for local customers.|$|R

After success at the Fillmore, the following month the play opened at The Committee, a theatre nightclub in the North Beach area of the city, where it was hoped it would enjoy a lengthy run.|$|E
25|$|McCartney {{had gained}} some {{experience}} in celebrity photography, {{and she became}} an unofficial house photographer <b>at</b> <b>Bill</b> Graham's Fillmore East concert hall. Among the artists she photographed there were Todd Rundgren, Aretha Franklin, Grace Slick, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Eric Clapton, Simon & Garfunkel, the Who, the Doors, the Animals, John Lennon and Neil Young.

25|$|The late Thomas John Taylor {{supposed}} {{that the main}} course of the river anciently flowed through what is now Team Valley, its outlet into the tidal river being by a waterfall <b>at</b> <b>Bill</b> Point (in the area of Bill Quay). His theory is {{not far from the}} truth, as there is evidence that prior to the last Ice Age, the River Wear did once follow the current route of the lower River Team, merging with the Tyne at Dunston. Ice diverted the course of the Wear to its current location, flowing east the course of the Tyne) and joining the North Sea at Sunderland.|$|E
25|$|Now Hudson {{was intent}} on {{capturing}} the line to Edinburgh for his empire, and he encouraged the development of railway plans to get there; the route such a line might take continued to generate considerable controversy. There was still ambiguity about Hudson's intentions for the bridge—an easier crossing point <b>at</b> <b>Bill</b> Quay, two miles downstream had been considered—and Newcastle Town Council sought undertakings from him. In addition he promised a footway crossing; this was apparently not a sweetener to the Town Council, but a commercial decision, expected to bring in £250 a week. The footway crossing was later extended to include horse drawn vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Jimmy Stewart, an {{expatriate}} English producer, {{had recently}} {{set up a}} new independent label, Sweet Peach. Stewart approached the La De Das with an offer to record and release The Happy Prince in late 1968. The band began intensive rehearsals in preparation for recording <b>at</b> <b>Bill</b> Armstrong's Melbourne studio. But by November the label had pulled out and the deal collapsed. It was at this point that Melbourne identity Adrian Rawlins came to their rescue. At a gig at the Here Disco in North Sydney; he exhorted the band not to give up on the project and his enthusiasm convinced Trevor Wilson to give it one more try. Gathering support from Widmer and Cordon Bleu, Barry Kimberly of publishers Essex Music and the EMI label, Rawlins and Widmer managed to stitch together a deal to record the album.|$|E

50|$|During the {{formative}} {{years of her}} career in the 1950s, country singer Loretta Lynn was often a featured star <b>at</b> <b>Bill's</b> Tavern on Peace Portal Drive in Blaine. William Hafstrom owned the tavern; it no longer exists. Lynn was then living on Loomis Trail Road near Custer, Washington.|$|R
25|$|Later in his career, Halberstam {{turned to}} sports, {{publishing}} The Breaks of the Game, {{an inside look}} <b>at</b> <b>Bill</b> Walton and the 1979-80 Portland Trail Blazers basketball team; Summer of '49, on the baseball pennant race battle between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox; October 1964, on the 1964 World Series between the New York Yankees and St. Louis Cardinals; Playing for Keeps, an ambitious book on Michael Jordan in 1999; The Teammates: A Portrait of a Friendship, focusing on the relationships between {{several members of the}} Boston Red Sox in the 1940s; and The Education of a Coach, about New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. Much of his sports writing, particularly his baseball books, focuses on the personalities of the players and the times they lived in as much as on the games themselves.|$|E
25|$|With the UK {{success of}} Family's first two albums, the band {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} the United States in April 1969, but it was beset by problems. Halfway through the tour, Grech unexpectedly left the band to join the new supergroup Blind Faith; on the recommendation of tour manager Peter Grant, Grech was replaced by John Weider, previously of Eric Burdon and The Animals. A further setback occurred during their first concert <b>at</b> <b>Bill</b> Graham's Fillmore East, whilst sharing the bill with Ten Years After and The Nice – during his stage routine, Chapman lost control of his microphone stand, which flew in Graham's direction, an act Graham took to be deliberate; Chapman performed the following shows with his hands by his sides, {{and by the end of}} the tour he had lost his voice; Family's reputation in the US never recovered and they ultimately never achieved great recognition there.|$|E
25|$|The Women's Little 500 is {{a bicycle}} race held {{annually}} <b>at</b> <b>Bill</b> Armstrong Stadium {{on the campus}} of Indiana University Bloomington. The race is modelled after the men's Little 500. The race has been run the Friday before the men's race, since its conception in 1988. It consists of half the distance of the men's race: 100 laps (25.49 miles) around the quarter-mile cinder track (410-meters) at the Bill Armstrong Stadium. Racers usually compete in teams of four, but teams can be as few as two, as long as that was the number of team members with which they qualified for the race. These teams usually have a common bond such as living in the same residence hall or being members of the same sorority, or they simply are an independent group with common interests. Each team is only given two bikes on which to ride and therefore, must compete in a relay-style that is rare in other races.|$|E
