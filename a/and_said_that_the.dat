5|$|Around {{the time}} of Kameo release, lead {{designer}} George Andreas felt that the original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product. He {{said that there were}} enough ideas for a sequel within the new intellectual property if players were interested. Years later, Andreas reappraised <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game should never have been released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over. Andreas felt that the effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, May {{confirmed}} that pre-production work was continuing. He said the band had approved {{a team to}} start filming later in 2011, and Baron Cohen's eagerness had been the key to progress.

May said they had parted on good terms <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band had felt Cohen's presence would have been distracting.|$|E

5|$|Retaliatory punishments, or Qisas, are practised: for instance, an eye can be surgically removed at {{the insistence}} of a victim who lost his own eye. This {{occurred}} in a case reported in 2000. Families of someone unlawfully killed can choose between demanding the death penalty or granting clemency in return for a payment of diyya, or blood money, by the perpetrator. There has been a growing trend of exorbitant blood-money demands, for example a sum of $11 million was reported as being recently demanded. Saudi officials and religious figures have criticized this trend <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> practise of diyya has become corrupted.|$|E
5|$|TED {{community}} director Tom Rielly {{helped the}} film's producers gain {{approval for the}} use of the TED brand, which had not previously been used for promotional purposes.

5|$|The {{game was}} {{positively}} received by reviewers and won two awards at the 2010 GDC Independent Games Festival. Reviewers praised the cooperative gameplay highly {{but said that}} the single-player was less fun because there was less to do. Many comparisons were made between Monaco and other media; the most common being the 1960 heist film Oceans 11. Reviewers liked the art style <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gameplay suited the minimalistic design.|$|E
5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was {{on the wrong side}} of the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, reports emerged {{suggesting}} My Bloody Valentine would reunite for the 2008 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, United States. Similar reports had {{circulated in}} 2003, stating that Shields, Butcher and Ó Cíosóig were together in Berlin, Germany, re-recording five songs recorded for Glider, which were due for release on an upcoming box set; and in 2007, reports suggested My Bloody Valentine {{were due to}} perform at a series of Pod-organised concerts at the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Kilmainham, Dublin. Shields later confirmed the reunion <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band's third studio album, which he had begun recording in 1996, was near completion. Three live shows in the United Kingdom were announced in November 2007 and on 13 June 2008, My Bloody Valentine performed in public {{for the first time}} in 16 years during two live rehearsals at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London.|$|E

5|$|In {{what was}} {{according}} to coach Lou Holtz a prearranged move, New York Jets rookie quarterback Richard Todd {{was replaced by}} Joe Namath {{late in the first}} quarter. Namath responded with a passing display that gave the Jets a 24–0 halftime lead. Saying that his players were “polite” to Namath, coach McKay compared the Buccaneers to a junior-high team, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only thing they did better than the Jets was to be the first team on the field after halftime. Clark Gaines rushed for 103 yards for the Jets. The Buccaneers’ three quarterbacks combined for 171 yards passing, more than the Jets’ quarterbacks, but the Buccaneers failed to score for the fourth time in the season. As the score rose, the press box announcer began calling out records set during the game, which included the Jets’ first shutout in Shea Stadium. This was considered to be the Buccaneers’ last good chance to win a game, with the next four opponents all in playoff contention. The Jets’ 34 points were nearly a third of their season total of 110 after ten games, and a fifth of their season total of 169.|$|E
5|$|On September 13, 2012, {{long time}} Tory MHA and former cabinet {{minister}} Tom Osborne {{announced he was}} leaving the PC Party to sit as an independent. He cited Dunderdale's leadership {{as the reason for}} his defection <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> turning point for him was the debate over Bill 29. Osborne said that while he voted in favour of the new legislation he did not support it. On October 19, 2012, Dunderdale shuffled her cabinet and Justice Minister Felix Collins, who was responsible for Bill 29, was shuffled out of the Justice portfolio and became Minister of Intergovernmental and Aboriginal Affairs. Though the portfolio change was considered to be a demotion Dunderdale stated that Collins' handling of Bill 29 was not connected to his move. At the time of the cabinet shuffle Dunderdale also created the Office of Public Engagement, which will bring together different departments to aid in communications efforts. The new office will also be responsible for access to information.|$|E
5|$|Plato, in his Laws, {{set forth}} rules that governed not the ideal state, which he {{described}} in The Republic, but what he felt might be obtainable in the real world. Included amongst them were some dealing with inheritance and heiresses. In general outline, they conformed to Athenian practice, with {{the daughter of a}} man who died without male heirs becoming an epikleros. Plato gave rules governing who the husband of the epikleros might be, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> inherited plot might not be divided or added to another plot. The main departure from Athenian law came if there was no direct heir, and the inheritance go to collateral relations. In that case, Plato assigned the inheritance not to one person, but to a pair, one male and one female, and ordered that they must marry and provide an heir to the estate, much like the epikleros.|$|E

5|$|The French {{started their}} {{evacuation}} with their pre-conceived notion that few {{would want to}} head south. As knowledge of the migration program spread through the communist-controlled north, thousands of predominantly northern Catholic asylum-seekers descended on the capital Hanoi and the port of Haiphong, {{both of which were}} still in French control. This led to anarchy and confusion as the emigrants fought over limited shelter, food, medicine and places on the ships and planes that were bound for the south. By early August, there were over 200,000evacuees waiting in Hanoi and Haiphong. Initially the ad hoc camps had insufficient sanitation and water quality control, leading to the possibility of outbreaks of disease. Some American representatives said that they were the worst conditions they had seen. The conditions continued to be poor and chaotic after the evacuation got into full swing, and did not improve significantly for a month. There was no organization infrastructure as far as registration or medical records and immunisation of the waiting evacuees. The communists thus sent their propaganda activists through the camps <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lack of organisation proved that life for prospective refugees would be even worse in the south, where they would be completely under the control of South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by KID, with direction by Takumi Nakazawa, planning and scenario writing by Kotaro Uchikoshi, character design by Yuu Takigawa, and music by Takeshi Abo. Nakazawa and Uchikoshi were appointed to their respective positions as they had worked on the previous game in the Infinity series, , which had been well received. As Ever 17 was to be released on consoles, it was required to be finished {{two months before the}} planned August release, meaning that after the scenario's completion in May, there was only time for debugging until late June. Uchikoshi and Nakazawa described this as a tight development schedule, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game was only possible through the staff working very hard, and a lot of things being worked on at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} jointly written by Kumar and David Brooks Miller. In order {{to present the}} correct {{technical}} and medical facts in the film, Kumar analysed documents of the court proceedings, forensic evidences and interviewed several survivors of the tragedy and also the staff members of the Union Carbide plant. Bhopal Group for Information and Action and many activists fighting {{for the rights of}} the victim of the disaster wanted to stop the film's screening, called it an insult to the victims, blamed the filmmakers of distorting the facts related to the disaster, diverting attention from Dow Chemical Company which acquired Union Carbide in 2001 and for portraying Anderson as a person who wanted to help the people but was unable to do so. Sheen denied these allegations and said that he did not sympathise for Anderson. Kumar also denied these allegations <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> organisations had seen an older script. He added that making the film was a life-changing experience for him. A Prayer for Rain was added to the film's title because had it rained on the night of 2—3 December 1984, fewer people would have died.|$|E
