50|$|The two eastern North American species, T. canadensis and T. caroliniana, {{are under}} serious threat by the sap-sucking insect Adelges tsugae (hemlock woolly adelgid). This adelgid, {{related to the}} aphids, was {{introduced}} accidentally from eastern Asia, where {{it is only a}} minor pest. Extensive mortality has occurred, particularly east of the Appalachian Mountains. The Asian species are resistant to this pest, and the two western <b>American</b> <b>hemlocks</b> are moderately resistant. In North America, hemlocks are also attacked by hemlock looper. Larger infected hemlocks have large, relatively high root systems that can bring other trees down if one falls. The foliage of young trees is often browsed by deer, and the seeds are eaten by finches and small rodents.|$|R

50|$|Hemlock has had {{a limited}} medical use {{throughout}} history. The Greeks used it not just as capital punishment, but also as an antispasmodic and treatment for arthritis. Books from the 10th century attest to medical use by the Anglo-Saxons. In the Middle Ages {{it was believed that}} hemlock could be used to cure rabies; in later European times it came to be associated with flying ointments in witchcraft. Native <b>Americans</b> used <b>hemlock</b> extract as arrow poison.|$|R
50|$|The Porcupine Mountains {{are home}} to the most {{extensive}} stand of old growth northern hardwood forest in North America west of the Adirondack Mountains, spanning at least 31000 acre. In these virgin forests, sugar maple, <b>American</b> basswood, eastern <b>hemlock,</b> and yellow birch are the most abundant tree species.|$|R
50|$|Tuscarora State Park {{is located}} in Locust Valley. This land was covered by an old-growth forest of eastern white pine, <b>American</b> chestnut, eastern <b>hemlock,</b> ash, hickory, elm, oak and cherry trees. The land was {{controlled}} at various times by the Susquehannock, Lenape {{and at the time}} of the arrival of colonial settlers, the Iroquois League of Five Nations.|$|R
40|$|The hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae Annand (Homoptera: Adelgidae) is an {{invasive}} alien pest {{of eastern}} North <b>American</b> <b>hemlocks</b> (Tsuga spp.) {{and is the}} target of a classical biological control program in the eastern United States. Host range testing conducted under quarantine in Blacksburg, Virginia determined the suitability of Laricobius nigrinus Fender (Coleoptera: Derodontidae) a predatory beetle, as a biological control agent of this pest. Members of the genus Laricobius are known to feed on adelgids. Laricobius nigrinus, native to western North America, was tested on three other adelgid and three non-adelgid species of Homoptera in three families. Host acceptance and host suitability tests were conducted on test prey. In paired-choice and no-choice oviposition tests, L. nigrinus females preferred to oviposit in HWA ovisacs over the other test species. Feeding tests showed that L. nigrinus consumed more eggs of HWA than eggs of Adelges piceae (Ratzeburg) and Pineus strobi (Hartig), but not of Adelges abietis (L.). In larval development tests, L. nigrinus only completed development on HWA. These results suggest that L. nigrinus has a narrow host range and that it has potential for biological control of HWA. Laricobius nigrinus was cleared for field release by USDA APHIS in 2000 based on these findings and NAPPO Guidelines for ‘Petition for Release of Exotic Entomophagous Agents for the Biological Control of Pests’. Test design will be discussed in a retrospective analysis in relation to the practical realities of host range testing in this system and compared with what might be the ideal...|$|R
5|$|A hemlock-mixed {{hardwood}} palustrine {{forest is}} present in the vicinity of Scotch Run east of the reservoir on the stream. The forest contains wooded wetlands and vernal pools. Trees inhabiting the forest include white oak, red oak, tulip poplar, yellow birch, eastern <b>hemlock,</b> <b>American</b> beech, and red maple. Other plants in the forest include teaberry, sphagnum moss, wood anemone, false hellebore, skunk cabbage, goldthread, and sensitive fern.|$|R

5000|$|The Forrest H. Dutlinger Natural Area is a {{protected}} area in Clinton County, Pennsylvania {{that includes a}} 158 acre old-growth forest of Eastern <b>Hemlock,</b> <b>American</b> Beech, Black Cherry, Sugar Maple, and Northern Red Oak. There are also Eastern White Pines, but a few were selectively logged around 1900. The largest tree is an Eastern Hemlock, 43 in diameter at breast height and 112 ft tall.|$|R
50|$|The {{wilderness}} {{is in the}} Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion. Much of {{the wilderness}} was once logged, but new growth forests have now taken hold in the logged areas. Some old-growth forests {{can also be found}} in the wilderness. The most significant are about 260 acre along Bee Branch Gorge and Buck Rough Canyon, which include old Eastern <b>Hemlock,</b> <b>American</b> Beech, Sweet Birch, White Oak, and Tulip Poplar.|$|R
50|$|The {{areas are}} {{a remnant of}} the {{original}} forest that once covered 6 e6acre km2 on the Allegheny Plateau of New York and Pennsylvania. The old growth forest consists of 300- to 400-year-old <b>American</b> beech, Eastern <b>hemlock</b> and some sugar maple. Other tree species are yellow birch, sweet birch, black cherry, red maple, American basswood, tulip poplar, and cucumber magnolia.

5000|$|While {{surveying}} the Mason-Dixon line in 1767, the English astronomer George Mason {{and a team}} of colonial surveyors ascended Chestnut Ridge and passed within three miles of the southern tip of Quebec Run. Mason described the area in his journal as [...] "a wild of wildes: the laurel overgrown, the rocks gaping to swallow up, over whose deep mouths you may step. The whole is a deep melancholy appearance out of nature.” At this time Quebec Run was blanketed by old-growth forest dominated by <b>American</b> chestnut, eastern <b>hemlock,</b> oak, and maple.|$|R
40|$|This report clarifies {{the effects}} of the Inclination angle of the tool (I) and the grain angle of the {{workpiece}} (φ_ 1) upon the components, the resultants of the cutting force, and the frictional coefficient in the oblique cutting of wood parallel to the grain. Air - dried specimens of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don), hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa), and <b>American</b> western <b>hemlock</b> (Tsuga heterophylla Sarg.) were used in this study. They were cut by the feeding of a tool which were set on the experimental apparatus equipped with a three - dimensional elastic - ring dynamometer (Figs. 1 ～ 4). The lateral (F_X), main (F_Y), and thrust (F_Z) components of the cutting force acting on the tool were measured. In addition to the measurements of these three components, several cutting phenomena were observed and measured. Using the measured components given above, the resultant forces (R and R_C) and the frictional coefficient on the tool rake - face (μ) were calculated, and {{the effects of}} the cutting conditions (I, φ_ 1, and depth of cut (t_n)) and {{the effects of the}} wood species upon them are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The eastern North <b>American</b> native <b>hemlock</b> species, Tsuga canadensis and T. caroliniana, {{are highly}} {{susceptible}} to injury from the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA); while the Asian species, T. chinensis (Franch.) E. Pritz; T. diversifolia (Maxim.) Mast.; and T. sieboldii Carriere {{are reported to}} show more tolerance (McClure 1992, 1995). In western North America, the adelgid is not considered a pest problem, {{although it has been}} documented on the two native species, T. mertensiana and T. heterophylla, since the early 1900 s. In Japan and China, HWA appears to be a relatively minor pest of T. diversifolia, T. seiboldii, and T. chinensis, whose impact is limited by natural enemies, host resistance, and scattered distribution (McClure 1992, 1995, 1996; Montgomery 1999). In a comparison of HWA performance on and damage to the four North American species and one Asian species, T. diversifolia, McClure (1992) reported dramatically greater HWA survival, egg laying, and hemlock bud kill on the two eastern species. Hemlock bud kill was greater than 80 % on T. canadensis and T. caroliniana; it was 1 % or less on the western and Asian species. No adelgids have been observed on the few T. chinensis and T. diversifolia at the U. S. Nationa...|$|R
2500|$|The Paulins Kill valley {{contains}} many protected areas. Swartswood State Park, established in 1914 {{as the first}} and oldest state park in New Jersey, is on [...] just north of Paulins Kill Lake in Sussex County. Along Kittatinny Ridge {{in the northern part}} of the watershed are parts of Worthington State Forest (west), Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area (central), and Stokes State Forests (east). In addition to these state forests, the Paulins Kill valley is host to a variety of common coniferous and deciduous trees, which have been harvested for lumber in the past, including: white oak and black oak, buttonwood, eastern red cedar, eastern <b>hemlock,</b> <b>American</b> chestnut, black walnut, tamarack larch, spruce, and pine. Trees that add to the beauty of the fall foliage include maple, birch, hickory, elm, and crab apple.|$|R
50|$|The Nine Mile Creek {{corridor}} {{supports a}} high diversity of plants {{due to a}} temperate climate, wide range of wetland and terrestrial habitats, nutritious limestone bedrock, and floodplain soils. In total, some 142 different species of plants have been documented in the Nine Mile Creek corridor and its associated wetlands. Ninety-two of these species are commonly occurring throughout the Nine Mile Creek corridor, whereas the other 49 occur in specific locations along the creek. In terms of variation in plant communities along the creek, there is a rather uniform floral composition from the outlet of Otisco Lake to Masters Road. Dense herbivorous vegetation and numerous layers of forest canopy typify it. A mix of herbaceous and woody vegetation provides robust riparian buffers. This area is home {{to many of the}} 92 commonly seen plant species observed in the Nine Mile Creek area, and is also home to protected ferns and such protected or rarely seen plants as cardinal flower, button bush, speckled alder, and mild water pepper. From Masters Road to the Village center, there is vegetation similar to that in the upper sections. However, additional species include Scotch pine and butternut, both of which are occasionally seen in the area. This section includes the only regulated wetland in the town of Marcellus, MAR-11, that is located within the flood plain of Nine Mile Creek. The flora of this wetland includes blue flag, crack willow, hardstem bulrush, numerous sedges (Carex sp.) and dogwoods (Cornus sp.). Due east of the DEC parking area at Marcellus Falls and along the Nine Mile Creek corridor are steep slopes and a group of important springs which drain into the creek. The area is of considerable botanical interest. In 1983, the Adirondack Wildflower Club documented the flora north of the town center by walking down the old Martisco Railroad bed. Aside from documenting all of the 92 commonly seen species in the creek corridor, the club noted the presence of the following state protected plants: large-flowered trillium, stinking Benjamin or wake-robin, bloodroot, fancy (toothed) wood fern, fragile fern and bulblet fern. Also present here were trees not observed in other sections of the creek: northern white cedar, <b>American</b> sycamore, eastern <b>hemlock</b> and yellow birch.|$|R
