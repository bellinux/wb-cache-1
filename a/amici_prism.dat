50|$|An Amici roof prism, {{named for}} its inventor, the Italian {{astronomer}} Giovanni Amici, {{is a type of}} reflecting prism used to deviate a beam of light by 90° while simultaneously inverting the image. It is commonly used in the eyepieces of telescopes as an image erecting system. It is sometimes called an <b>Amici</b> <b>prism</b> or right angle roof prism. The non-dispersive Amici roof prism {{should not be confused with}} the dispersive <b>Amici</b> <b>prism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Amici himself never {{published}} {{about his}} nondeviating prism, but rather communicated {{the idea to}} his friend Donati, who constructed the device for observations of stellar spectra. Donati's publications of his observations (in 1862) were the first disclosure of the prism doubling idea, and because the prism was practical to build and much more compact than multiple prism arrangements typical of that period for producing high spectral dispersion, Amici's invention quickly {{caught the attention of}} researchers throughout Europe. However, the dispersion of <b>Amici</b> <b>prisms</b> can be accurately calculated using the multiple-prism dispersion theory assuming no spatial separation between the prism components.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} roof <b>prism</b> is the <b>Amici</b> roof <b>prism,</b> {{with other}} common roof prism designs being the Abbe-Koenig prism, the Schmidt-Pechan prism {{and probably the}} best known being the roof pentaprism pictured here. A porro prism is not a roof prism, contrary to popular notion, as the two 90° faces usually don't meet in a Porro prism and therefore don't form a roof edge.|$|R
5000|$|Prism {{diagonal}}s:A prism diagonal uses {{either a}} simple 90-degree angle prism, pentaprism or an <b>Amici</b> roof <b>prism</b> {{rather than a}} mirror to bend the light path. A pentaprism provides the same inverted image orientation as viewing without a diagonal would. A simple 90-degree angle prism provides the same [...] "flipped" [...] or mirror reversed image as a mirror diagonal. An <b>amici</b> roof <b>prism</b> {{on the other hand}} provides a correct non-reversed view. This means that what is seen in the eyepiece is the same as what is seen when looking at the sky, or a star chart or lunar map. The disadvantage of typical [...] "correct image" [...] <b>Amici</b> roof <b>prism</b> diagonals is that because the light path bounces around through a piece of glass, the total amount of light transmitted is less and the multiple reflections required can introduce optical aberrations. Therefore, most <b>Amici</b> roof <b>prisms</b> are more appropriate for low power viewing or for use in spotting scopes for terrestrial rather than astronomical use. On the other hand, a well-made conventional 90-degree prism star diagonal can transmit as much or more light as a mirror, and do so with higher image contrast since there is no possibility of light scattering from a reflective metallic surface as in a mirror diagonal. Also a prism will never degrade over time as a mirror will since there is no reflective metal coating to degrade from oxidation. However prism diagonals may introduce chromatic aberration when used with short focal-length scopes although this isn’t a problem with the popular Schmidt-Cassegrain and Maksutov Cassegrain telescopes, which have long focal lengths. On longer focal ratio telescopes a well-made 90-degree prism diagonal is the optimum choice to deliver the highest image contrast short of using the telescope without a diagonal entirely. However prisms seem to be falling out of favor probably due to marketing forces which have been favoring short focal length instruments which tend to function better with a mirror diagonal. Pentaprism diagonals are extremely difficult to find. In some special cases however, the color dispersion effects of a prism diagonal can be used to advantage to improve the performance of undercorrected refractor objectives (regardless of focal length) by shifting the spherical and color correction of the objective closer to the design optimum. The natural color dispersion properties (overcorrection) of the prism works to lessen or nullify the undercorrection of the objective lens.|$|R
50|$|An <b>Amici</b> <b>prism,</b> {{named for}} the {{astronomer}} Giovanni Amici, {{is a type of}} compound dispersive prism used in spectrometers. The <b>Amici</b> <b>prism</b> consists of two triangular prisms in contact, with the first typically being made from a medium-dispersion crown glass, and the second a higher-dispersion flint glass. Light entering the first prism is refracted at the first air-glass interface, refracted again at the interface between the two prisms, and then exits the second prism at near-normal incidence. The prism angles and materials are chosen such that one wavelength (colour) of light, the centre wavelength, exits the prism parallel to (but offset from) the entrance beam. The prism assembly is thus a direct-vision prism, and is commonly used as such in hand-held spectroscopes. Other wavelengths are deflected at angles depending on the glass dispersion of the materials. Looking at a light source through the prism thus shows the optical spectrum of the source.|$|E
50|$|An <b>Amici</b> <b>prism</b> {{is a type}} of {{roof prism}} which splits the image in two parts and thus allows an upright image without {{left-right}} mirroring. However, a disadvantage is that at higher magnifications (> 100x) brighter objects have a bright line through the object viewed. But with low-power usage with a rich field, the field can easily be compared with star charts as it is no mirror image.|$|E
50|$|The {{telescope}} hosts two instruments: REMIR, {{an infrared}} imaging camera, and ROSS, a visible imager and slitless spectrograph. The two cameras can observe simultaneously {{thanks to a}} dichroic placed before telescope focus the same field of view of 10×10 arc minutes. In the infrared range from 1 to 2.3 µm REMIR can use a (z′, J, H, K′) filter set. ROSS {{is equipped with a}} standard filter set (V, R, I) and an slitless <b>Amici</b> <b>prism.</b>|$|E
40|$|Inverting goggles {{were made}} {{of a pair of}} <b>Amici</b> Dach <b>prisms.</b> The author myself wore the goggles as the subject for 14 days. During the period, the subject {{reported}} several kinds of impression concerning the intermodal/perceptual-motor disorder and reorganization. They were (1) the problem of reality, (2) the reversal impression each of the three dimensions (up-down, distance, and left-right dimensions), and (3) the motor performance. The subject also has an experience wearing left-right reversing goggles two years ago as well as for 14 days. Therefore, the perceptual impression could be compared between the two rearrangements. In the case of left-right reversed vision, visual information through the goggles gives the strong impression that the visual world is real. On the other hand, it is weak under the condition of the inverted vision. Because of the weakness of the reality, perceptual-motor disorders are not so severe under the condition of the latter visual rearrangement...|$|R
50|$|In the {{original}} spectroscope {{design in the}} early 19th century, light entered a slit and a collimating lens transformed the light into a thin beam of parallel rays. The light then passed through a prism (in hand-held spectroscopes, usually an <b>Amici</b> <b>prism)</b> that refracted the beam into a spectrum because different wavelengths were refracted different amounts due to dispersion. This image was then viewed through a tube with a scale that was transposed upon the spectral image, enabling its direct measurement.|$|E
50|$|By 1860, Amici {{realized}} {{that one can}} join this type of prism back-to-back with a reflected copy of itself, producing a three-prism arrangement known as a double <b>Amici</b> <b>prism.</b> This doubling of the original prism increases the angular dispersion of the assembly, and also has the useful property that the centre wavelength is refracted back into the direct line of the entrance beam. The exiting ray of the center wavelength is thus not only undeviated from the incident ray, but also experiences no translation (i.e. transverse displacement or offset) away from the incident ray's path.|$|E

NICS is a FOSC-type cryogenic focal reducer, equipped with two interchangeable cameras feeding a Rockwell Hawaii 1024 x 1024 array. The camera used for the spectroscopic observations has a focal ratio of F/ 4. 3, corresponding to a plate scale = 0. 25 ”/pixel (Oliva & Gennari 1995; Baffa et al. 2000). Among the many imaging and spectroscopic observing modes, NICS offers a unique, high throughput, low resolution spectroscopic mode with an <b>Amici</b> <b>prism</b> disperser (Oliva 2001), which yields a complete 0. 9 - 2. 5 µm spectrum. A 1. 0 ” width slit corresponding to a spectral resolving power R≃ 50 and quasi-constant along the spectrum, has been used. The low resolution together with the high efficiency of the Amic...|$|E
40|$|This Phd thesis {{was entirely}} {{developed}} at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG, Roque de los Muchachos, La Palma Canary Islands) {{with the aim of}} designing, developing and implementing a new Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Near Infrared Camera Spectrometer (NICS) installed on the Nasmyth A of the telescope. The idea of a new GUI for NICS has risen for optimizing the astronomers work through a set of powerful tools not present in the existing GUI, such as the possibility to move automatically, an object on the slit or do a very preliminary images analysis and spectra extraction. The new GUI also provides a wide and versatile image display, an automatic procedure to find out the astronomical objects and a facility for the automatic image crosstalk correction. In order to test the overall correct functioning of the new GUI for NICS, and providing some information on the atmospheric extinction at the TNG site, two telluric standard stars have been spectroscopically observed within some engineering time, namely Hip 031303 and Hip 031567. The used NICS set-up is as follows: Large Field (0. 25 " /pixel) mode, 0. 5 " slit and spectral dispersion through the <b>AMICI</b> <b>prism</b> (R 100), and the higher resolution (R 1000) JH and HK grisms...|$|E
