40|$|EEG source {{localization}} {{estimates the}} origin of electrical activity based on the electrode potentials measured at the scalp. This technique is particularly useful in the diagnosis of patients with epilepsy. The estimation procedure requires a head model representing the actual human head. Traditionally, the conductivity of brain tissues in the head model {{is assumed to be}} isotropic. In reality, the skull and white matter are anisotropic. Recent studies have shown that neglecting these anisotropic properties can cause localization errors up to 20 mm. Often these studies are done using simulations assuming noiseless EEG. In this study we want see the effect of noisy EEG on the dipole localization and orientation error due to neglecting <b>anisotropic</b> <b>conductivities</b> of skull and white matter. Simulations were performed where a grid of dipole sources was placed in a head model with <b>anisotropic</b> <b>conductivities.</b> The forward solution was superimposed with noise fragments extracted from a background EEG recording. For each instance of noisy EEG the inverse problem was solved in a head model with similar geometry but where the conductivity of skull and white matter was set to isotropic. In this way we obtain a distribution of dipole location error and orientation due to neglecting <b>anisotropic</b> <b>conductivities</b> in function of the noise level. The results show that for low noise levels the dipole location and orientation error due to noise and using a simplified head model is about 5 till 10 mm larger than the location error due to noise only. At higher noise levels the accuracy of the EEG source localization can be improved if <b>anisotropic</b> <b>conductivities</b> are incorporated and multiple time samples are used as input to the inverse problem. We can conclude that incorporating <b>anisotropic</b> <b>conductivities</b> can improve the accuracy of EEG source localization, which is beneficial for the pre-surgical planning of patients with epilepsy. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Electrical {{logging-while-drilling}} (LWD) {{tools are}} commonly used in {{oil and gas exploration}} to estimate the conductivity (resistivity) of adjacent earth media. In general, earth media exhibit <b>anisotropic</b> <b>conductivities.</b> This implies that when LWD tools are used for deviated and horizontal drilling, the resulting borehole problem may include dipping-layered media with dipping beds having full 3 × 3 conductivity tensors. To model this problem, we describe a 3 -D cylindrical finite-difference timedomain (FDTD) algorithm extended to fully anisotropic conductive media and implemented with cylindrical perfectly matched layers to mimic open-domain problems. The 3 -D FDTD algorithm is validated against analytical results in simple formations, showing good agreement, and used to simulate the response of LWD tools through anisotropic dipping beds for various values of <b>anisotropic</b> <b>conductivities</b> and dipping angles.
