40|$|Abstract—To detect <b>and</b> {{receive the}} <b>high</b> dynamic <b>and</b> <b>high</b> information-rate signal for high {{altitude}} platform station(HAPS) in the stratosphere, {{it is necessary}} to design digital system to acquire and track the carrier. In the <b>high</b> dynamic <b>and</b> <b>high</b> information-rate situation, the most important aspect is the great influence of Doppler frequency shift <b>and</b> <b>high</b> information rate on the carrier acquisition and track. Carrier acquisition and track in the <b>high</b> dynamic <b>and</b> <b>high</b> information-rate situation was implemented by means of the combination of FPGA and frequency, phase lock loop. A new algorithm using DQPSK for carrier acquisition and track was proposed and the validity of the design and algorithm was proved by means of trials and comparison with EKF method in the <b>high</b> dynamic <b>and</b> <b>high</b> information-rate situation.

5|$|An {{example for}} the fission and fusion {{mechanism}} {{can be found in}} nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases. These are membrane-bound enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a hydride ion between NAD(H) and NADP(H) in a reaction that is coupled to transmembrane proton translocation. They consist of three major functional units (I, II, and III) that can be found in different arrangement in bacteria, protozoa, <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the three groups of domain arrangements were acquired and fused independently.|$|E
