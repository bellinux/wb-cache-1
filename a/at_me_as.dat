The music critic Henry Chorley, who was with him, wrote [...] "I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose enjoyment of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind." ...|$|E
500|$|At Fairbanks, {{the three}} B-29s {{encountered}} significant headwinds; {{more than the}} [...] "slight" [...] headwinds observed up to this time. They had expected tailwinds from the jet stream, yet could complete the distance without them, but headwinds meant that Washington might be too far. At 7am Eastern War Time, aircraft Number 2 was over Northway, Alaska, and navigator Bill Townes determined that they were behind schedule. He said later, [...] "When I reported that fact to General LeMay, he looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if {{he thought it was}} my fault, so I retreated behind my bulkhead to check my figures." [...] Later, the airmen learned that the typhoon near Okinawa the week before had greatly affected the jet stream.|$|E
500|$|Not knowing at {{the time}} that he would be {{referring}} to deleted scenes, Andrew Lincoln told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "I remember going on set for the season premiere and seeing a couple of the prop guys, and they just looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> they gave me my gun and they went, 'You know, in this episode we kill more zombies than in the whole of Season 1.' They actually counted the kills! And when it came time for the taking-of-the-courtyard scene, that was just carnage." [...] He added, [...] "It really wasn't that well plotted. We just got sent zombies towards us and we had to improvise stabbing, so it was a bit touch-and-go from time to time." ...|$|E

500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people would look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I {{began to think that}} maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E
500|$|Lupe Fiasco {{has stated}} on MTV's Rap Fix {{as well as}} in various other media that he is a Muslim, and that Islam [...] "plays a part in my life and {{everything}} I do, to a certain extent...

I don't want them to look at my flaws and be like, 'oh, that's the flaws of Islam'." [...] His mixtape series Fahrenheit 1/15 featured a remix of Kanye West's [...] "Jesus Walks" [...] entitled [...] "Muhammad Walks", which went on to become very popular in the Muslim community. He can be heard using Islamic recitals in [...] "Hurt Me Soul", [...] "Little Weapon", [...] "Hi-Definition" [...] as well as the intro and outro tracks to Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor. Most recently, Lupe Fiasco claimed to believe Islam will one day take over the world.|$|E
500|$|Mendelssohn met {{and worked}} with Lind many times, and started an opera, Lorelei, for her, based on {{the legend of the}} Lorelei Rhine maidens; the opera was {{unfinished}} at his death. He is said to have tailored the aria [...] "Hear Ye Israel" [...] in his oratorio Elijah to Lind's voice, although she did not sing this part until after his death, at a concert in December 1848. In 1847 Mendelssohn attended a London performance of Meyerbeer's Robert le diable– an opera which musically he despised– in order to hear Lind's British debut, in the role of Alice. The music critic Henry Chorley, who was with him, wrote [...] "I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose enjoyment of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind. His attachment to Mlle.

500|$|Janet Jackson {{was born}} in Gary, Indiana, the {{youngest}} of ten children. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated {{to pursue a career}} in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio. At age seven, Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino and began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976. The year after, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family before joining the cast of Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey for two years. Jackson also played the recurring role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series. When Jackson was sixteen, she was arranged a contract with A Records and released her self-titled debut album in 1982. She stated, [...] "On my first album the songs were sort of teenage like. I wanted to make a change for my second album. The first album indroduces you. The second one sets your image. I couldn't stay like that. People would still look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a little girl and I'd never grow". [...] "Don't Stand Another Chance" [...] was written by Jackson, her brother Marlon Jackson and musician John Barnes. Marlon Jackson also produced the single and provided backing vocals along with his brothers Michael, Tito, and Jackie. Although it was slated for a mid-July release, [...] "Don't Stand Another Chance" [...] was released on August 13, 1984.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} published in ABC Film Review in November 1964, Cushing stated, [...] "People look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if I were {{some sort of}} monster, but I can't think why. In my macabre pictures, I have either been a monster-maker or a monster-destroyer, but never a monster. Actually, I'm a gentle fellow. Never harmed a fly. I love animals, and when I'm in the country I'm a keen bird-watcher." [...] In {{an interview}} published in 1966, he added, [...] "I do get terribly tired with the neighbourhood kids telling me 'My mum says she wouldn't want to meet you in a dark alley'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nogradi won the Janikovszky-Eva {{award in}} 2003, {{but he has}} never {{received}} any national awards. As he says, [...] "They look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> an outsider, {{because the people who}} give the awards in our country do not fully understand what I have been trying to accomplish with my work and my projects. Fortunately, my readers, the children (and their parents) do, so as long as they love and read my books, I am happy. As a famous Hungarian poet, Sandor Weöres, once said, a writer, if he is any good, must live a sort of life that the powers that be do not even consider him for an award.... I agree." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mendelssohn {{was present}} at Lind's London debut in Robert le Diable, and his friend, the critic H. F. Chorley, who was with him, wrote [...] "I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose {{enjoyment}} of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind. His attachment to Mademoiselle Lind's genius as a singer was unbounded, as was his desire for her success". Mendelssohn worked with Lind on many occasions and wrote the beginnings of an opera, Lorelei, for her, based on {{the legend of the}} Lorelei Rhine maidens; the opera was unfinished at his death. He included a high F sharp in his oratorio Elijah ("Hear Ye Israel") with Lind's voice in mind.|$|E
2500|$|Zorn {{was quoted}} in 1998 as saying [...] "Sometimes I {{get the feeling that}} people just don't see me as a {{composer}}, but it's what I've always been since I was eight years old... I've always thought of myself as a composer, but the world has had a hard time looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a composer because a lot of what I compose is controversial." [...] The establishment of Tzadik allowed him to release many compositions which he had been written over the previous two decades for classical ensembles. Zorn's earliest released [...] "classical" [...] composition (for five flutes), [...] "Christabel" [...] (1972) first appeared on Angelus Novus in 1998. Zorn credits the composition of his 1988 piece for string quartet [...] "Cat O' Nine Tails", commissioned and originally released by the Kronos Quartet (Short Stories), to awakening him to the possibilities of writing for classical musicians. This composition was featured on The String Quartets (1999) and Cartoon S/M (2000) along with variations on [...] "Kol Nidre", inspired by the Jewish prayer of atonement which was written {{at the same time as}} (but not part of) the first Masada Book. [...] (1998) was Zorn's first full-scale orchestral release featuring pianist Stephen Drury, the Hungarian Radio Children's Choir and the American Composers Orchestra conducted by Dennis Russell Davies.|$|E
