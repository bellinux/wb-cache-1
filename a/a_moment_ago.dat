Beliefs become reality.' Yes, across Europe, this wall will fall. For it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth. The wall cannot withstand freedom." ...|$|E
500|$|Whitehead {{pointed to}} the {{limitations}} of language {{as one of the}} main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking, and acknowledged that {{it may be difficult to}} ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech. [...] After all, each moment of each person's life can hardly be given a different proper name, and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things, rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>ago.</b> [...] Yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that [...] "material substances" [...] or [...] "essences" [...] are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular, concrete processes. [...] No one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old, and in many ways is not the same person at all; Whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next.|$|E

[...] But she cannot bring herself to do it: (Aria: Teneri, teneri figli, Essi, pur dianzi delizia mia / [...] "My dear, dear sons; <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>ago</b> they were my delight, in their smiles, I thought I saw the forgiveness of heaven.") [...] The children wake up and she calls for Clotilde, demanding that Adalgisa be brought to her.|$|E

50|$|The episode {{ends with}} Isobel’s (Mia Kirshner) return and her going to Jenna’s house. She {{introduces}} herself as Alaric's ex-wife, something that shocks Jenna since <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> Alaric {{was telling her}} once again that Isobel is dead.|$|R

60|$|But I {{could not}} make the other man see it. I felt that some service was due from me to Justice, in {{compensation}} of the wrong I had done her <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> and I argued most eloquently.|$|R
6000|$|... "I put {{you up to}} nothing. I didn't {{even put}} you up to the chance that, as I said <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> I saw for you in {{forwarding}} that thing. Your liberty is therefore in every way complete." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Kate,' said Mrs Nickleby, {{kissing her}} {{daughter}} affectionately. 'How ill you looked <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>ago!</b> You quite frightened me, I declare!' ...|$|E

6000|$|Grant quickly {{recovered}} himself. [...] "I am afraid," [...] he said, coming forward, [...] "unless Miss Harcourt does, that I am a mere trespasser in your house, Senora.

6000|$|Ralph {{leaned over}} his father's pillows and gently {{smoothed}} them; {{he was aware}} their talk had been unduly prolonged.

60|$|She {{looked away}} from him and shuddered. This passionate {{absorption}} of all his energies into one channel had made a fiend of the man.
