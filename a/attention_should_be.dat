5|$|Smithers' {{devotion to}} Mr. Burns was {{inspired}} from how numerous Fox executives {{and staff members}} acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' ambiguous sexual orientation came from Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but little <b>attention</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> drawn to it. Smithers' first name (Waylon) was derived from that of puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E

For example, most of SAPs are weakly cross-linked acrylic acid-based polymer and they are often used under salinity conditions, so much more <b>attentions</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> focused on the improvement of their salt resistance. Moreover, SAPs are often used under pressure conditions, so the gel strength <b>should</b> also <b>be</b> considered.|$|R

30|$|Even {{though the}} result of this study cannot be {{directly}} applied in other time-critical crowdsourcing tasks, it provides insights into how {{to strike a balance between}} exploration and exploitation. For example, during the crowdsourced manhunt event for the Boston Marathon bombers, the authorities should have observed that misinformation dominated useful information from the very beginning [9], and the self-correcting crowd hardly deterred it. Therefore, <b>attentions</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> paid to the discussion threads or Twitter feeds that continually deliver useful information that advanced the search.|$|R

25|$|A {{combination}} of ACE inhibitor with other drugs may increase {{effects of these}} drugs, but also the risk of adverse effects. The commonly reported adverse effects of drug combination with ACE are acute renal failure, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The drugs interacting with ACE inhibitor should be prescribed with caution. Special <b>attention</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> given to combinations of ACE inhibitor with other RAAS blockers, diuretics (especially potassium-sparing diuretics), NSAIDs, anticoagulants, cyclosporine, DPP-4 inhibitors, and potassium supplements.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{identify}} the effect of land-use pattern on rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment relations in Zichang Watershed of the Loess Plateau. From 1986 to 1997, many farmlands changed into grassland or woodland, especially the farmland in steep slope positions or far away from the river. The change of land-use pattern altered the rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment relationships, and led to higher slope of trend curves(STCs) of annual rainfall-runoff mass curve and runoff-sediment mass curve in 1990 s than that in 1980 s. It is implied that more soil and water loss yielded in 1990 s. In order to reduce soil loss, more <b>attentions</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> paid to land-use pattern and some grass or other herbaceous filter strips <b>should</b> <b>be</b> built along rivers...|$|R

25|$|The cost {{difference}} is more evident {{when compared with}} mutual funds that charge a front-end or back-end load as ETFs do not have loads at all. The redemption fee and short-term trading fees are examples of other fees associated with mutual funds that do not exist with ETFs. Traders should be cautious if they plan to trade inverse and leveraged ETFs for short periods of time. Close <b>attention</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> paid to transaction costs and daily performance rates as the potential combined compound loss can sometimes go unrecognized and offset potential gains {{over a longer period}} of time.|$|E
