40|$|Abstract: <b>AC</b> motors (<b>Alternating</b> <b>Current</b> motors) have {{a simple}} {{structure}} and has higher efficiency than the DC motors (Direct Current motors) when operated at high speed. AC motors also provide more durable service with a lower cost compared to DC motors. Besides, AC motors can easily be supplied directly from the grid and therefore they are widely used in industry. However, when it is directly connected to the grid, traditional AC motor gets the better performance only at the speed near the synchronous speed due to its working principle. In some low cost applications where only DC is available, e. g. in electrical vehicles, the usages of AC motor are limited. It is well-known that the variable speed drive offers significant energy savings in an industrial set-up. Thus, by employing variable speed drives in industry, there exists huge scope for energy saving. The vector control scheme can give a swift response since the flux and torque are controlled separately. Here a vector control scheme based on rotor flux of induction motor is developed using MATLAB/Simulink.

50|$|The Admittance {{technique}} is {{an improvement over}} the Conductance technique for the real-time removal of muscle conductance Gm. Blood and muscle respond to <b>alternating</b> (<b>AC)</b> electrical <b>currents</b> very differently. Blood is purely resistive while muscle has both resistive and capacitive properties. The fixed charges in muscle cells create a significant reactance that causes a phase shift (time delay) in the measured signal, relative to the excitation signal. Admittance technology uses this phase shift to determine the instantaneous muscle conductance and remove it from the total measured conductance.|$|R

The original system also tentatively included H for heavy-haul and S for high-speed, but no actual vehicles were delivered under this designation. The number following the first letter indicates the top speed of the locomotive in kilometers per hour. The next two letters indicate the supply system, with <b>AC</b> for <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> electric locomotives, DC for direct current electric locomotives, MS for multi-system locomotives capable of operating both under AC and DC overhead wires, and DE was foreseen from the start for an eventual Diesel-electric version. An extra P letter at the end was to designate powerheads (traction heads), that is locomotives with one driving cabin for push-pull operation. An also optional number at the end designates different versions, later used for the designation of generations.|$|R
40|$|A compact sized PDE with an i. d. of 0. 75 in. {{and length}} of 1 m was paired with an {{automotive}} turbocharger. The turbine-compressor shaft was used to drive a small ac generator by means of speed reduction wheels. The PDE was tested with propane-oxygen mixture at 15 Hz {{for a period of}} about 20 s. The turbine spun up to a speed of 127, 000 rpm, whilst the generator produced electric power at 27 W and the compressor pumped air at a rate of 0. 055 kg/s. The exhaust of the turbine was measured to be 800 ˚C, which implies that the exhaust has enough enthalpy to drive a few more turbine stages. The radial turbine results in more losses as it diverts the flow by 90 ˚ and its housing also creates hot spots. Axial turbines are better suited for application with PDEs and also enable better speed reduction gearing mechanisms to be applied, allowing larger and heavier generators to be used with turbines. The turbocharger did not exhibit any signs of damage after several minutes of testing. In subsequent tests with the PDE, detonations were observed for H 2 -O 2 mixtures, but H 2 -Air mixtures failed to detonate.

Another very popular method was to use a two part tank coil with a primary and secondary winding separated by an air gap. Power control was affected by varying the magnetic coupling of the two coils by physically moving them relative to each other.|$|E

Units equipped for DC traction collected electrical current from a third rail using a collector shoe attached to their bogies, which were in turn connected to traction motors (mostly built in the 1950s, even those used on newer stock). AC-powered EMUs collected power from overhead lines using a pantograph.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} subcutaneous detemir on glucose flux, lipid metabolism and brain function, twelve people with type 1 diabetes received in random order 0. 5 Units/kgBW detemir or NPH insulin. Glucose concentration was clamped at 5 mmol/L then increased to 10 mmol/L. Glucose production rate (glucose Ra), glucose uptake (glucose Rd) and glycerol production (glycerol Ra) were measured with a constant iv infusion of [6, 6 (2) H 2]glucose and [(2) H 5]glycerol. Electroencephalography direct (DC) and <b>alternating</b> (<b>AC)</b> <b>current</b> potentials were measured. While detemir induced comparable effects on glucose Ra, glucose Rd and glycerol Ra during euglycaemia, compared with NPH, it triggered a distinct negative shift in DC-potentials, with significant treatment effect in frontal cerebrocortical channels (p< 0. 001). AC spectral power showed significant differences in theta and alpha frequencies during euglycaemia (p= 0. 03).

5000|$|Many {{electrical}} devices use direct current (DC) power, often provided by an <b>AC</b> (<b>alternating</b> <b>current)</b> to DC adapter, {{also known as}} a [...] "wall wart" [...] or [...] "power brick". The adapter typically supplies power to the device through a thin electrical cord which terminates in a coaxial power connector often referred to as a [...] "barrel plug" [...] (so-named because of its cylindrical shape). The polarity of the adapter cord and plug must match the polarity of the device, meaning that the positive contact of the plug must mate with the positive contact in the receptacle, and the negative plug contact must mate with the negative receptacle contact. Since there is no standardization of these plugs, a polarity symbol is printed on the case indicating which type of plug is needed.|$|E
50|$|The key {{difference}} between an alternator and a generator is that the alternator delivers <b>AC</b> (<b>alternating</b> <b>current)</b> to the external circuit, while the generator delivers DC (direct current). In both machines alternating current is induced in the armature, but the type of current delivered to the external circuit depends {{on the way in}} which the induced current is collected. In an alternator, the current is collected brushes bearing against slip-rings; in a generator, a form of rotating switch called the commutator is placed between the armature and the external circuit. The commutator is designed to reverse the connections with the external circuit at the instant of each reversal of induced current in the armature, producing rectified current or direct current. This rectified current is not pure like the current of a voltaic cell but is instead a pulsating current that is constant in direction and varying in intensity.|$|E
50|$|The Dual Mode P32AC-DM {{is unique}} {{as it is}} {{equipped}} with GE's GEB15 <b>AC</b> (<b>alternating</b> <b>current)</b> traction motors, rather than DC (direct current) motors as used in the other subtypes. It is also only one of two modern American electro-diesel locomotives with third-rail capability, along with the EMD DM30AC operated by the Long Island Rail Road. The British Rail Class 73 and Class 74 also have this capability, and New Jersey Transit and AMT's Bombardier ALP-45DP electro-diesel locomotive can operate from overhead catenary electrification. The model is confined to services operating from New York City, where diesel emissions through its two fully enclosed main terminal stations are prohibited. P32AC-DMs are seen only on Amtrak's Empire Corridor between Penn Station& Grand Central Terminal and Buffalo, the Ethan Allen Express, Lake Shore Limited (New York section), Adirondack, and Maple Leaf services. However, sometimes the P32AC's are traded out for a P42DC at Albany. This {{is due to the}} requirement for the P32AC-DM engines exclusively in this section of rail, and the higher horsepower rating of the P42DC. Metro-North's push-pull trains to and from Grand Central Terminal also utilize P32AC-DM units, and, unlike Amtrak's units, Metro-North's units have an escape hatch in the nose. As of July, 2017 Amtrak rerouted 3 Empire Corridor trains a day to run into Grand Central to reduce train traffic at Penn Station. Metro North Engineers take over from the Amtrak ones at Yonkers as the Amtrak Engineers are not qualified to run into Grand Central.|$|E
