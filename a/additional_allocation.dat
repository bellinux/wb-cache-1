5|$|From 2010 to 2011, {{the state}} {{experienced}} a slower growth due to weaker {{performance on the}} oil and gas sector. Based on 2014 survey, Sabah GDP recorded a 5.0% growth and remained as the largest contributor in agriculture sector with 18.1%, followed by Sarawak, Johor, Pahang and Perak. Its GDP per capita however are still lowest with RM19,672, the third lowest after Kelantan (RM11,815) and Kedah (RM17,321) from all 13 states. In the same year, the state export value stood at RM45.3billion with an import value of RM36.5billion. Machinery and transportation equipment accounted for most of the imported products followed by fuel, mineral lubricants and others. While Sabah mostly exports raw petroleum and palm oil. The state currently has a total of eight ports with two in Sepanggar while each one in Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan, Tawau, Kudat, Kunak and Lahad Datu that was operated and maintained by the Sabah Ports Authority owned by Suria Group. As part of the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (11MP), the federal government has approved an allocation of RM800million to expand the cargo handling of Sapangar Bay Container Port from 500,000 to 1.25million TEUs per annum as well to accommodate larger ship like Panamax-size vessels. An <b>additional</b> <b>allocation</b> of RM333.51million was given in the same year, making it a total of RM1.13billion with the project will start in 2017. The fisheries industries remain the important part of Sabah primary sector economy with a contribution for about 200,000 metric tonnes of fish worth RM700 annually as well contributing 2.8% to the state annual GDP. While the aquaculture and marine fish cage sector have produce 35,000 metric tons of brackish and fresh waters aquaculture and 360 metric ton of groupers, wrasses, snappers and lobsters worth around RM60million and RM13million respectively. Sabah {{is also one of the}} producer of seaweed, with most of the farms are located in the seas around Semporna.

Actually, at a rational expectations equilibrium agents may hold beliefs that explain poorly the history they observe, even when restricted to only those rationalizing their choices. This paper shows that if agents hold rationally formed expectations instead —in the sense of following from beliefs that explain history better than any other beliefs justifying their choices— then <b>additional</b> <b>allocations</b> unsupported by rational expectations can be shown to be equilibrium outcomes. By means of this result, it is established too that adding common knowledge of the rationality of the formation of expectations —on top of that of rationality of choices and market clearing— does not suffice either to guarantee rational expectations. Interestingly, the rationally formed expectations equilibria produced in this paper exhibit a sunspot-like volatility that do not rely on an explicit sunspot mechanism...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{concerns}} scheduling {{problems with}} the aging effect and <b>additional</b> resource <b>allocation.</b> A measurable result of the aging phenomenon is that {{the time required to}} perform a job increases whereas the <b>additional</b> resource <b>allocation</b> allows one to decrease it. As an example of a deteriorating system that can be described and optimized by the application of the models and algorithms considered, we choose the pickling process, where cleaning of metal items decreases the efficiency of the pickling (cleaning) bath (i. e., one containing an active substance), whereas heating it up can improve the efficiency. In particular, we focus on the optimization problems for such systems and model them as single-machine scheduling problems with job processing times dependent on the fatigue of a machine and on the <b>allocation</b> of <b>additional</b> resources. The objectives considered are the minimization of time criteria (the maximum completion time and the maximum lateness) under a given resource consumption as well as the minimization of the resource consumption under given time criteria. The computational complexity of the problems is determined and solution properties are proved. On the basis of these, we construct optimal polynomial time algorithms for some cases of the problems considered...|$|R
40|$|Internet address {{allocation}} schemes have a {{huge impact}} on the size of routing tables. Due to the imminent deployment of IPv 6 and the rapidly growing number of users worldwide, it is very urgent that we have a good address allocation algorithm for IPv 6. Addresses are allocated by registries to users in the form of prefixes. Such an allocation dovetails nicely with the Longest Matching Prefix algorithm employed by routers to keep the address lookup problem scalable. However, some users inevitably grow in size and need more addresses. The <b>additional</b> <b>allocations</b> often end up creating new prefixes, causing undesirable “address fragmentation. ” We further develop a simple algorithm, called Growthbased Address Partitioning (GAP), proposed in Wang (2005). GAP allocates addresses taking into account the possibility that users may grow in the future. However, it makes the unrealistic assumption that this growth rate is known {{at the time of the}} initial request. In this paper, we develop an online version of the GAP algorithm and use theory, simulations and real data from the Asia Pacific and the Chinese registries to show that the online version yields an order of magnitude less address fragmentation compared to existing allocation schemes. This is significant for reducing routing table size, increasing scalability and improving the performance of the Internet...|$|R
