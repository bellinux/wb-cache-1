60|$|Seventhly, That {{as there}} is one part that is dissoluble by the Air, so are there other parts with which {{the parts of the}} <b>Air</b> <b>mixing</b> and uniting, do make a Coagulum, or precipitation, as one may call it, which causes it to be {{separated}} from the Air, but this precipitate is so light, and in so small and rarify'd or porous clusters, that it is very volatil, and is easily carry'd up by the motion of the Air, though afterwards, when the heat and agitation that kept it rarify'd ceases, it easily condenses, and commixt with other indissoluble parts, it sticks and adheres to the next bodies it meets withall; and this is a certain Salt that may be extracted out of Soot.|$|E

50|$|The mixing plenum {{normally}} combines two air streams, {{and includes}} for {{three sets of}} dampers: one for the fresh air, one for the exhaust air, and a mixing damper between the two air streams. The mix of fresh air and recirculated air can thus be adjusted to suit {{the needs of the}} building's occupants. Most systems will use motorized dampers to control the <b>air</b> <b>mixing,</b> and controlled by the building management system (BMS), or controls system. Typically as the fresh air and exhaust air dampers are driven from 0% open to 100% open, the mixing damper will in turn be driven from 100% open to 0% open, so as to always ensure a constant volume of supply and extract air.|$|E
50|$|If {{a stream}} or jet of air is {{directed}} through a flame, fuel <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> is enhanced and the jet exiting the flame is intensely hot. Jewelers and glassblowers engaged in lampwork {{have used the}} blowpipe since ancient times, with the blast being powered by the user's lungs. For small work, mouth-blown blowpipes may be used with candle flames or alcohol lamps. Starting in the 1800s, blowpipes have been powered by mechanisms, initially bladders and bellows, but now blowers, compressors and compressed gas cylinders are commonplace. While blowing air is effective, blowing oxygen produces higher temperatures, {{and it is also}} practical to invert the roles of the gasses and blow fuel through air. Contemporary blowtorches and oxy-fuel welding and cutting torches can be considered to be modern developments of the blowpipe.|$|E
50|$|The final oxygen {{concentration}} delivered {{by a simple}} face mask is dependent upon the amount of room air that mixes with the oxygen the patient breathes. The <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> is determined by how much air any individual is breathing at the moment, combined with the fit of the mask. Because of the variability in these factors, the final {{oxygen concentration}} is uncontrolled. A venturi device attached to the mask {{can be used to}} control to some degree the concentration of oxygen delivered, usually this is used to prevent respiratory depression in emphysema patients who have lost the ability to fully inhale. The effectiveness of the therapy can be continuously monitored using a pulse oximeter, though more clinically useful data can only by obtained by drawing arterial blood gas.|$|E

50|$|The most {{effective}} air door for containing conditioned air inside a building {{with an open}} door will have a high face velocity at the opening, generated by top-down flow, and air recovery by a recirculating air plenum and duct return to the source fans. This configuration is feasible for new construction, but difficult to implement in existing buildings. The air door is {{most effective}} with low exterior wind velocity; at higher wind velocities, the rate of <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> increases and the outside air portion of the total face flow increases. Under ideal conditions of zero wind, {{the effectiveness of the}} air door is at its maximum, but in windy locations air doors cannot create a perfect seal, but are often used {{to reduce the amount of}} infiltration from an opening.|$|E

The area was rebranded as Salford Quays and redevelopment by Urban Waterside began in 1985 under the Salford Quays Development Plan. Faced with major pollution issues from quality of the water in the ship canal, dams were built to isolate the docks, after which water quality was improved by aerating it using a compressed <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> system. Within two years the quality was sufficient to introduce 12,000 coarse fish, which have thrived in the environment. Water quality is monitored fortnightly by scientists from APEM, the Manchester University Aquatic Pollution and Environmental Monitoring Unit, and the improved habitat has been recognised by the Angling Foundation and the Institute of Fisheries Management.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimentally investigate the influence of <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fans on air temperature and humidity distribution in an arched roof greenhouse. The greenhouse was occupied by a tomato crop and equipped with two side roll-up openings for ventilation, a PVC pipe heating system and a fan coil heater. Furthermore, for <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> purposes, an <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan was used. Air temperature and relative humidity was simultaneously recorded in 17 positions equally distributed inside the greenhouse. Concerning the effects of <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan on microclimate distribution, {{it was found that}} the mixing fan increased microclimate homogeneity. On the other hand, the use of fan-coil heater was found to increase microclimate heterogeneity. The maximum absolute air temperature and relative humidity difference (observed above the crop) between the centre of the greenhouse and the different measuring positions at the same level, was about 1 °C and 4 % respectively when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan was not used and about 0. 4 °C and 1 % respectively, when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan was used. The use of a fan-coil heater increased the above mentioned differences to the level of about 1. 7 °C and 6 % respectively when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan was not used and about 1 °C and 3 % respectively, when the <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan was used. Finally, it was observed that the use of an <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> fan and/or a fan-coil heater reduced the greenhouse air relative humidity...|$|E
40|$|Liquid {{desiccant}} is an energy-saving, {{environmentally friendly}} and healthy means of air dehumidification. A liquid desiccant-based all-air {{air conditioning system}} is studied by simulation. Two different modes of <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> between the return air and the fresh air are compared, that is mixing before and mixing after the liquid desiccant dehumidifier, respectively. System performance and total energy consumption of the two modes under different operation conditions are obtained. The results show that mixing air after dehumidification consumes less energy than mixing air before dehumidification. Coefficient of performance (COP) of the all-air system with <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> after dehumidification is higher. The differences of COP and energy consumption between the two <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> modes increase when the outdoor air temperature and relative humidity increase. Practical application: Liquid desiccant based all-air system is quite suitable for museums, libraries and computer centres where water {{is not allowed to}} enter the space for property safety and strict thermal-hygrometric control is necessary.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the influence of spray position on fuel <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> quality, three-dimensional numerical simulation of the working process of a heavy-duty diesel was conducted. To quantitatively study the mechanism {{of the effect of}} spray position on fuel <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> process, the deviation of spray centroid was introduced to describe the spray position change in combustion chamber. The results show that the gas intake swirl can affect the spatial distribution of spray in combustion chamber under three directions in cylindrical coordinate, in which the circumferential distribution is affected most. It then can be concluded that the spray can be limited to the vicinity of the combustion chamber axis. Better spray position, which is more helpful for the process of fuel <b>air</b> <b>mixing</b> and combustion, can be achieved by using optimal swirl, so that the power performance will be improved...|$|E
