40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} is a zoonosis with worldwide distribution. Its {{control has}} {{a direct impact on}} public health and livestock production. This study estimated the prevalence of infected herds and adult bovines and evaluated risk factors associated with the presence of tuberculosis within herds in the state of Paraná. The state was divided in seven livestock regions and independent sampling was performed. A total of 1, 419 farms were sampled and 16, 045 animals were tested using the intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin diagnostic test. The apparent and estimated prevalence rates in farms and <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> were 2. 15 % (95 % CI: 1. 31 - 3. 00) and 0. 42 % (95 % CI: 0. 04 - 0. 81), respectively. It was not possible to state with 95 % confidence that the disease prevalence in any region was significantly different from that in other regions. There were no positive animals in the western region, and the prevalence of positive herds and animals in the other regions ranged from 1. 03 % to 3. 89 % and 0. 17 % to 1. 08 %, respectively. The logistic regression model identified larger herd size (OR = 2. 4) and mechanical cmilking (OR = 5. 18) as risk factors associated with the presence of bovine tuberculosis. The combination of low prevalence with risk factors associated to larger herds and more intensive dairy farming, renders the state of Paraná a good candidate for the implementation of industry-based free-herd accreditation schemes and makes a case for planning risk-based surveillance targeted at major dairy basins...|$|E

Both rennets were, {{in the presence of}} sodium chloride, most stable at 10 °C or lower at pH 4. 7 for <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and pH 4. 1 for lamb. Heat treatment in a sodium chlorine solution (200 mg/ml) at 68 °C for 60 minutes destroyed less than 35 % of the activity of each rennet. Under the same conditions calf rennet was completely inactivated. The cheesemaking properties of <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and lamb rennets were compared with calf rennet. <b>Adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and calf rennets responded similarly to changes of pH however lamb rennet appeared less active than calf rennet at higher pH's when measured in caseinate solution but appeared more active than calf rennet when measured in milk by a curd tension method. The optimum temperature for milk coagulating activity was 40 °C for <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and calf rennets but only 30 °C for lamb rennet when measured in caseinate solution. The curd tension of milk coagulated with the three rennets increased with time but both <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and lamb rennets appeared more sensitive to milk calcium levels than calf rennet. Whole casein, αs-, β- and k-caseins were hydrolysed in a similar manner by the three rennets. <b>Adult</b> <b>bovine</b> rennet was the most proteolytic on whole and β- caseins while calf rennet hydrolysed αs- and k-caseins more rapidly than the other rennets. Two pepsins, of similar amino acid compositions, were isolated, one from <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> rennet and one from lamb rennet which also contained a rennin. All three enzymes were purified so that lamb rennin and pepsin each produced only a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but the <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> pepsin produced two bands and appeared to be heterogeneous. Cheese made with <b>adult</b> <b>bovine,</b> lamb or a 50 / 50 mixture of calf-adult bovine rennets were compared with cheese made with calf rennet and found to be similar in manufacturing characteristics, flavour and body after three and six months storage at 6 or 13 °C. Polyacrylaride gel electrophoretograms of these cheese after one to twelve months storage at 6 °C showed that the milk coagulant had no effect on the casein degradation products produced in the cheese although the rate of degradation varied slightly. Perchloric acid was found to be a good protein precipitant for quenching casein-rennet reactions and was utilize in a ethod which was developed for assaying milk coagulating activity. Rennet was added to sodium caseinate solution and one minute later the reaction quenched with perchloric acid. The quantity of peptides hydrolysed from the casein was measured at 217 nm and was directly proportional to rennet activity over a limited range of activity. A method for removing mucoproteins, the major impurity in rennet, was developed and a commercial scale plant commissioned. A diethylaminoethyl cellulose based resin, equilibrated with a citrate buffer, retained the rennet enzymes while the mucoproteins passed through uninhibited. The enzymes were eluted with the same buffer made 1. 0 M with sodium chloride. The eluent was more active than the original rennet, was crystal clear in appearance and remained so during twelve months storage when normally mucoproteins would have precipitated out of solution to form a cloud in the rennet...|$|R

MethodsExplant cultures of <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> articular cartilage were radiolabeled with [14 C]lysine in medium including {{fetal bovine serum}} and ascorbate, and then maintained for chase periods up to 28 days. In some samples, β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) was included during chase to inhibit lysyl oxidase-mediated collagen crosslinking. Tissue was hydrolyzed and analyzed for [14 C]metabolites in the forms of lysine, hydroxylysine, dehydrodihydroxylysinonorleucine (ΔDHLNL), and hydroxylysyl pyridinoline (HP). ResultsExplant cultures of <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> articular cartilage metabolized lysine into hydroxylysine and the collagen crosslinks, ΔDHLNL and HP. During chase, [14 C]hydroxylysine maintained steady-state levels, [14 C]DHLNL rose to a plateau, and [14 C]HP increased gradually. Addition of BAPN inhibited formation of [14 C]DHLNL. Analysis of raw data and that normalized to [14 C]hydroxylysine gave characteristic time constants for formation of ΔDHLNL and HP crosslinks of 1 – 2 and 7 – 30 days, respectively. The distribution of [14 C]lysine metabolites in collagen crosslinks was described by peak values in [14 C]DHLNL/[14 C]hydroxylysine of 0. 047 – 0. 064 and in [14 C]HP/[14 C]hydroxylysine of 0. 03.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In vitro {{mechanical}} injury of articular cartilage {{is useful to}} identify events associated with development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA). To date, many in vitro injury models have used animal cartilage despite the greater clinical relevance of human cartilage. We aimed to characterize a new in vitro injury model using elderly human femoral head cartilage and compare its behavior to that of an existing model with <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> humeral head cartilage. DESIGN: Mechanical properties of human and bovine cartilage disks were characterized by elastic modulus and hydraulic permeability in radially confined axial compression, and by Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and direction-dependent radial strain in unconfined compression. Biochemical composition was assessed in terms of tissue water, solid, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) contents. Responses to {{mechanical injury}} were assessed by observation of macroscopic superficial tissue cracks and histological measurements of cell viability following single injurious ramp loads at 7 or 70 %/s strain rate to 3 or 14 MPa peak stress. RESULTS: Confined compression moduli and Young's moduli were greater in elderly human femoral cartilage vs <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> humeral cartilage whereas hydraulic permeability was less. Radial deformations of axially compressed explant disks were more anisotropic (direction-dependent) for the human cartilage. In both cartilage sources, tissue cracking and associated cell death during injurious loading was common for 14 MPa peak stress at both strain rates. CONCLUSION: Despite differences in mechanical properties, acute damage induced by injurious loading was similar in both elderly human femoral cartilage and <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> humeral cartilage, supporting the clinical relevance of animal-based cartilage injury models. However, inherent structural differences such as cell density may influence subsequent cell-mediated responses to injurious loading and affect the development of OA...|$|R

Similar parameters were also measured in the interfascicular adipose tissue dissected from four muscles. Adipose tissue from animals of the leaner Holstein breed contained smaller cells than the respective tissues from the fatter Hereford X Angus animals. The small subcutaneous deposit in the Holstein animals was due to a small number of adipose cells that were small in size. During growth of the <b>bovine</b> <b>animal,</b> an increase in adipose tissue mass was accompanied by cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia. However, by 14 months of life hyperplasia was complete in all but the interfascicular adipose tissue. In the 14 -month-old Hereford X Angus steers, interfascicular adipose tissue had an appreciable number of small cells and a bimodal distribution for cell diameter. The {{results of this study suggest}} that interfascicular adipose tissue is a late developing depot and that hyperplasia is still an active process in this depot at 14 months of life, whereas hyperplasia appears to be nearly complete in the subcutaneous and perirenal depots of <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> by about 8 months of life or shortly thereafter.
