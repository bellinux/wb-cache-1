5000|$|This {{approach}} is not usable in most garbage collected languages - notably tracing garbage collectors or more <b>advanced</b> <b>reference</b> counting - due to finalization being non-deterministic, and sometimes not occurring at all. That is, {{it is difficult to}} define (or determine) when or if a finalizer method might be called; this is commonly known as the finalizer problem. Java and other GC'd languages frequently use manual management for scarce system resources besides memory via the dispose pattern: any object which manages resources is expected to implement the [...] method, which releases any such resources and marks the object as inactive. Programmers are expected to invoke [...] manually as appropriate to prevent [...] "leaking" [...] of scarce graphics resources. Depending on the [...] method (how Java implements finalizers) to release graphics resources is widely viewed as poor programming practice among Java programmers, and similarly the analogous [...] method in Python cannot be relied on for releasing resources.

50|$|Horatio Hale was {{the first}} person to publish a Tokelauan {{dictionary}} of sorts, which he did in 1846. Rather than being the accepted definition of dictionary, it was reference only contained 214 entries of vocabulary. Hale’s publication remained the only published Tokelauan reference until 1969. However, Tokelauan had been instituted into schools in the late 1940s, so prior to this publication, there wasn’t much headway made in the teaching of the language. In 1969, the New Zealand Department of Education published D. W. Boardman’s Tokelau-English Vocabulary. This second, more <b>advanced</b> <b>reference</b> was a collection of around 1200 vocabulary entries. In the times that passed after the second publication, the necessity of a more detailed and in depth reference to the language for the purpose of education with the Tokelauan community was realized by Hosea Kirifi (who later became the first Tokelau Director of Education) and J. H. Webster. In the year 1975, Kirifi and Webster published the first official precursory Tokelauan dictionary, which contained an estimated 3000 items, called the Tokelau-English Dictionary. This entire movement was a basis of the fact that The Tokelauan people take a great deal of pride in their language. Tokelauan schools lacked an abundance of resources and materials that could be used to education their children on the language. It has a high place in their culture, and the revitalization and renewal of the language for their younger generation had eventually reached a point where action had to be taken. One year after the publication of the 1975 Tokelau-English Dictionary, the government approved the installation of Ropati Simona who was to head the Tokelau Dictionary Project. This eventually led to the publication of the first comprehensive Tokelauan dictionary, Tokelau Dictionary by the Office of Tokelau Affairs in 1986.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{control of}} power {{converters}} {{is a vital}} activity in large physics projects. Several different control scenarios may coexist, including regulation of a circuit's voltage, current, or field strength within a magnet. Depending {{on the type of}} facility, a circuit's reference value may be changed asynchronously or synchronously with other circuits. Synchronous changes may be on demand or under the control of a cyclic timing system. In other cases, the reference may be calculated in real-time by an outer regulation loop of some other quantity, such as the tune of the beam in a synchrotron. The power stage may be unipolar or bipolar in voltage and current. If it is unipolar in current, it may be used with a polarity switch. Depending on the design, the power stage may be controlled by a firing angle or PWM duty-cycle reference, or a voltage or current reference.

40|$|For {{active control}} {{purposes}} a double wall structure enables {{the measurement of}} a time <b>advanced</b> <b>reference</b> signal for a feedforward system because the reference signal can be measured at the primary panel and the control system {{can be applied to}} the second panel. In aerospace engineering these double wall sections are often filled with absorbent materials. These materials have an influence on the structural dynamics of the double wall section. In order to guarantee the function of the feedforward control system the damped double wall section has to show a linear system behavior. In order to analyze the linearity of double wall panels with different absorbent materials this study experimentally investigates different damping concepts on a simple double wall structure. The double wall structure is a buildup with two 0. 8 x 0. 6 m² aluminum plates and different damping concepts are applied to the cavity between. The absorbent material is added to the secondary panel where glass wool in different configurations or constraint layer damping is applied. The linear system behavior up to 500 Hz can be verified with the coherence function for all concepts.

40|$|This report {{evaluates the}} first year"s {{results of the}} {{research}} on the development of advanced electrochemical sensors for use in high subcritical and supercritical aqueous environments. The work has emphasized the designing of an <b>advanced</b> <b>reference</b> electrode, and the development of high-temperature pH and redox sensors for characterizing the fundamental properties of supercritical aqueous solutions. Also, electrochemical noise sensors have been designed for characterizing metal/water interactions, including corrosion processes. A test loop has been designed and constructed to meet the expected operation conditions. The authors have also developed an approach to define a practical pH scale for use with supercritical aqueous systems and an operational electrochemical thermocell was tested for pH measurements in HCl + NaCl aqueous solutions. The potentials of the thermocell for several HCl(aq) solutions of different concentrations have been measured over wide ranges of temperature from 25 to 400 C and for flow rates from 0. 1 to 1. 5 cm minsup - 1. The corresponding pH differences (DeltapH) for two HCl(aq) concentrations in 0. 1 NaCl(aq) solution have been experimentally derived and thermodynamically analyzed. Their first experimental measurements, and subsequent theoretical analysis, clearly demonstrate the viability of pH measurements in high subcritical and supercritical aqueous solutions with a high accuracy of 610. 02 to 0. 05 units. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Grammar of the English Tense System {{forms the}} first volume of a four-volume set, The Grammar of the English Verb Phrase. The other volumes, to appear over the next few years, will deal with mood and modality, aspect and voice. The book aims to provide a grammar of tense which can be used both as an <b>advanced</b> <b>reference</b> grammar (for example by MA-level or {{postgraduate}} students of English or linguistics) and as a scientific study which can act as a basis for and stimulus to further research. It provides not only a wealth of data but also a unique framework {{for the study of the}} English tense system, which achieves great predictive and explanatory power on the basis of a limited number of relatively simple rules. The framework provided allows for an analysis of the semantics of individual tenses which reflects the role of tenses not only in locating situations in time relative to speech time but also in relating situations in time relative to one another to form temporally coherent discourse. Attention is paid to the relations between tenses. On the one hand, we can identify sets of tenses linked to particular temporal areas such as the past or the future. These sets of tenses provide for the expression of a system of temporal relations in a stretch of discourse in which all the situations are located within the same temporal area. On the other hand, there are many contexts in which speakers might in theory choose between two or more tenses to locate a situation (e. g., when we choose between the past tense and the present perfect to locate a situation before speech time), and the book examines the difference that a choice of one or the other tense may make within a discourse context. The book moves from a detailed exploration of the meaning and use of individual tenses to a thorough analysis of the way in which tenses can be seen to function together as sets, and finally to a detailed examination of tenses in, and tenses interacting with, temporal adverbials. Original data is used frequently throughout the book to illustrate the theory discussed...|$|E
