5|$|Bloom {{says that}} some of the {{characters}} have not stood the test of time, writing that modern readers <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>with</b> the anti-semitic treatment of Cohn's character and the romanticization of a bullfighter. Moreover, Brett and Mike belong uniquely to the Jazz Age and do not translate to the modern era. Bloom believes the novel is in the canon of American literature for its formal qualities: its prose and style.|$|E

To them some of it looks negative and some of it looks depressing. Although I didn't feel that way. I always felt excited when I was writing them." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{an episode}} of The Krusty the Clown Show, three Itchy & Scratchy {{cartoons}} are shown. This angers Krusty, {{the host of the}} show, since he thinks he should be the star of the show and not the Itchy and Scratchy characters. Meanwhile, the Simpsons visit a television museum that is soon to be closed. After a while, they come to an exhibit displaying The Adventures of Fatso Flanagan, which is one of Homer's favorite television shows. There, the family is approached by Annie Dubinsky, the agent of the actor who played Fatso Flanagan. They start chatting and become acquainted. At the Channel 6 studios, during a board meeting, Krusty is fired because [...] "Today's children <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>with</b> a clown whose every reference they have to look up on Wikipedia", and because Itchy and Scratchy are shown to be more popular with the children. Krusty goes to his current agent, hoping to get a new job, but the agent drops him since he got fired.|$|E

50|$|There are {{strands of}} {{conservatism}} that have <b>been</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>with</b> liberal capitalism. Particularly in continental Europe, many conservatives have <b>been</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>with</b> {{the impact of}} capitalism upon culture and traditions. The conservative opposition to the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and especially the development of individualistic liberalism as a political theory and as institutionalized social practices sought to retain traditional social hierarchies, practices and institutions. There is also a conservative protectionist opposition to certain types of international capitalism.|$|R
500|$|The two {{claim the}} show's higher {{proportion}} of instances lampooning liberal rather than conservative orthodoxies stems simply from their preference for making fun of liberals. While Stone has been quoted saying, [...] "I hate conservatives, but I really fucking hate liberals", Stone and Parker have explained that their drive to lampoon a given target comes first from the target's insistence on telling other people how to behave. The duo explain that they regard liberals as having both delusions of entitlement to remain free from satire, and a propensity to enforce political correctness while patronizing the citizens of Middle America. Parker and Stone <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>with</b> the idea of themselves or South Park being assigned any kind of partisan classification. Parker said he rejects the [...] "South Park Republican" [...] and [...] "South Park conservative" [...] labels, feeling that either tag implies that one only adheres to strictly conservative or liberal viewpoints. Canadian columnist Jaime J. Weinman observes that the most die-hard conservatives who identified themselves as [...] "South Park Republicans" [...] began {{turning away from the}} label when the show ridiculed Republicans in the season nine (2005) episode [...] "Best Friends Forever." ...|$|E

"Notably, it {{is clear}} that Russian policy makers <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>with</b> the idea of a {{prominent}} role being granted to external actors in dealing with conflict in the former Soviet space. More recently, this has been extended specifically to the activities of international organisations in the management of conflict. As one group of influential Russian foreign policy commentators and policy makers put it in May 1996, it is definitely not in Russia’s interest to see outside mediation and peacekeeping operations on the territory of the former Soviet Union.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} dialects of the Malayalam {{language}} prevalent in North Malabar. Loan words, excluding the {{huge number of}} words from Sanskrit and Tamil, originated mostly due to centuries long interactions between the native population of North Malabar and the horse and spice traders of the world.

Examples of these dialects include Kasaragod Malayalam and Mappila Malayalam.

2500|$|A 2011 Gallup poll report {{stated that}} there has been an {{increase}} in Islamophobia over the past decade and defined it as [...] "An exaggerated fear, hatred, and hostility toward Islam and Muslims that is perpetuated by negative stereotypes resulting in bias, discrimination, and the marginalization and exclusion of Muslims from social, political, and civic life." [...] Another 2011 Poll provided by The Washington Post through the Public Religion Research Institute states that 48 percent of Americans <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>with</b> Muslim women wearing the burqa. A 2014 Pew Research Center survey found that Muslims were the most disliked religious group in the United States with an average [...] "cold" [...] rating of 40 (out of 100), which is lower than the 41 cold rating received by atheists.

2500|$|From the {{standpoint}} of post-secondary institutions outside of Quebec who {{may be trying to}} determine transfer credit, there are essentially two ways in which to interpret the two-year college program, bolstered by local and countrywide legislation. [...] The first option is to remove the first year of college study from consideration, since it is in fact the twelfth year of study overall in Quebec, and the laws of the land throughout Canada dictate that a high school diploma from Quebec lacks one additional year in order to be considered the equivalent of a high school diploma elsewhere. [...] The second option would be to include both years of college study in the evaluation, knowing that the maximum of possible transfer credit/advanced standing is one year at the freshman level. [...] This second option is viable if you <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>with</b> using the chronological separation of year 12 and year 13 as your rationale, especially since college courses are not necessarily all taken in a predetermined chronological order (the order can vary from student to student).|$|E

2500|$|Big Love {{was also}} studied {{as a part}} of Andrew Atkinson's study of HBO {{programs}} and the post-secular humanistic themes they elicit. In writing of Big Love, Atkinson too draws on the parallel between gay rights and polygamist rights illuminated by the series, but focuses more on the series' influential humanistic elements. In fact, he somewhat rebuffs earlier assertions made: [...] "The attention that is paid to the minute details of Mormon ritual, theology, and historical disputes demonstrates that HBO's writers <b>are</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>with</b> the supposed dichotomy that constructs homosexuality as by default areligious." [...] Atkinson focuses on the ending, interpreting Barb's blessing of Bill as a [...] "ritual innovation [...] indicates that FLDS Mormonism must shed the trappings of patriarchy if it wants to legitimate polygamy in a post-feminist society", and the fall of Alby, the closet homosexual, as a powerful interpretation of [...] "the future theo-political and sexual tensions that Mormonism, and by extension, the broader American polity, will face as the post-secular matures". In concluding, Atkinson makes the case that Big Love and other HBO shows like The Sopranos, The Wire and Six Feet Under [...] "contribute to a fuller conception of humanity" [...] than other forms of art and entertainment.|$|E
