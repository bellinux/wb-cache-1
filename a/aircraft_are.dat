5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force {{maintains}} several air bases, {{including three}} which are only occasionally activated. The RAAF's operational headquarters, Air Command, {{is located at}} RAAF Base Glenbrook near Sydney. The Air Force's combat <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> based at RAAF Base Amberley near Ipswich, Queensland, RAAF Base Tindal near Katherine, Northern Territory and RAAF Base Williamtown near Newcastle, New South Wales. The RAAF's maritime patrol <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> based at RAAF Base Edinburgh near Adelaide {{and most of its}} transport <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> based at RAAF Base Richmond in Sydney. RAAF Base Edinburgh is also home to the control centre for the Jindalee Operational Radar Network. Most of the RAAF's training <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> based at RAAF Base Pearce near Perth with the remaining aircraft located at RAAF Base East Sale near Sale, Victoria and RAAF Base Williamtown. The RAAF also maintains a network of bases in northern Australia to support operations to Australia's north. These bases include RAAF Base Darwin and RAAF Base Townsville and three 'bare bases' in Queensland and Western Australia. Of the RAAF's operational bases, only Tindal is located near an area in which the service's aircraft might feasibly see combat. While this protects the majority of the RAAF's assets from air attack, most air bases are poorly defended and <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> generally hangared in un-hardened shelters.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} USAF {{organizational}} realignment {{announced in}} April 2015, all B-1B <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> to be reassigned from Air Combat Command to Global Strike Command (GSC) effective 1 October 2015.|$|E
5|$|Based in Geilenkirchen, Germany, 18 E-3 AWACS were {{purchased}} – one lost in Greece, one retired from service. All of these <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> officially registered as aircraft of Luxembourg, a NATO member {{with no other}} air force.

5000|$|First {{built by}} Cal Poly students, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> {{registered}} under many names. On 17 March, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> christened with grape juice as the [...] "Glenmont". In April 1928 <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> first registered as the Warren & Montijo Monoplane. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> painted silver with a winged logo {{on either side}} that featured a W(Warren) and a M (Montijo) with Landau Sedan written below it. In August 1928 the <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> sold as a Glenmont Landau Sedan and renamed shortly afterward as the Belmont Cabin Monoplane M-1By 1933 the <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> registered as the Mason Meteor M and Mason Greater Meteor M-200.|$|R
5|$|GoAir <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> {{painted in}} {{different}} colour schemes such as blue and pink with the logo on the tail. In 2011, the airline announced that all its aircraft will convert {{to a new}} grey colour scheme.|$|E
5|$|JAL, whose fleet {{was entirely}} made of Boeing 747 {{aircraft}}, had painted {{all of its}} aircraft with tropical-influenced liveries along with Reso'cha titles. These <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> used on charter flights to holiday destinations in the Pacific, such as Hawaii. Reso'cha is a marketing abbreviation for Resort Charter. Reso'cha planes were formerly known as JAL Super Resort Express.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne is {{the second}} busiest airport in Australia. The airport is curfew-free and {{operates}} 24 hours a day, although between 2am and 4am, freight <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> more prevalent than passenger flights. In 2004, the environmental management systems were accredited ISO 14001, the world's best practice standard, making it the first airport in Australia to receive such accreditation.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{symbolic}} <b>aircraft</b> dot <b>is</b> {{above the horizon}} line (blue background) the <b>aircraft</b> <b>is</b> nose up. If {{the symbolic}} <b>aircraft</b> dot <b>is</b> below the horizon line (brown background) the <b>aircraft</b> <b>is</b> nose down.|$|R
5000|$|... 14 {{pre-production}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> ordered. A {{total of}} 81 A-variant <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> produced.|$|R
25|$|The {{accident}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> Airspeed Courier G-ACSY, c/n 16. The <b>aircraft</b> had <b>been</b> registered on 17 May 1934, The <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> on {{loan from}} Airspeed.|$|R
5|$|On 13 October 2017, No. 34 Squadron was {{transferred}} from No. 84 Wing to No. 86 Wing. This change {{was made to}} place the unit under the same headquarters as No. 33 Squadron, whose Airbus KC-30A <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> gaining a VIP role.|$|E
5|$|Other {{camouflage}} schemes {{acknowledge that}} aircraft {{may be seen}} at any angle and against any background while in combat, so <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> painted all over with a disruptive pattern or a neutral colour such as gray.|$|E
5|$|Regional airports, such as Edinburgh Airport, have {{experienced}} strong growth in CAT operations in recent years. These operations are commercially and operationally incompatible with GA, {{and although there}} is no evidence of deliberate discrimination, the effect has been to discourage or exclude it. GA <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> being subject to significant increases in charges, including the imposition of handling fees in some cases. Some airports restrict or deny GA parking, and others limit or refuse certain GA activity. As a result, light GA <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> now rarely or never seen at large, busy international airports such as Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick and Manchester.|$|E
50|$|The <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> {{constructed}} at the Boeing factory at {{the same}} time as the U.S. Air Force One VC-25s, though the U.S. <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> built to the 747-200 design, while the Japanese <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> built to the more contemporary 747-400 design. Both Japanese <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> delivered in 1990. The 747s will be replaced by new Boeing 777-300ER aircraft in fiscal year 2019.|$|R
5000|$|... 31 December 1951: Squadron <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> {{used for}} Operation Pin Wheel. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> secured {{to the flight}} deck, with engines running, and the thrust {{provided}} by the <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> used {{to assist in the}} docking of [...]|$|R
50|$|All <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> {{operated}} by National Air Services. After operations ceased, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> stored.|$|R
5|$|The Civil Air Patrol {{owns and}} {{operates}} a fleet not to exceed 550 single-engine aircraft, predominantly Cessna 172 Skyhawk and Cessna 182 Skylane aircraft. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> in a phased refurbishment program which began in 2008, replacing engines, interior, avionics, and paint {{at a lower cost}} than new purchases.|$|E
5|$|The data/messages {{from the}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> {{transmitted}} by the aircraft's Satellite Data Unit (SDU) and relayed via satellite to a ground station, {{where they are}} routed to other communication networks to reach their destination. Messages may also {{be sent to the}} aircraft, in reverse order. When passing through the satellite, the signals are amplified and translated in frequency—mixed with the signal from an oscillator in the satellite, leaving the satellite at the combined frequency. Transmissions from the <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> made on one of several channels (frequencies) near 1.6GHz, combined with frequency of the satellite's oscillator, and transmitted to the GES at the combined frequency (one of several channels near 3.6GHz). The ground station then translates the received signal before it reaches equipment to be processed. The ground station keeps a log of transmissions and some data about them.|$|E
5|$|The {{small size}} of the airport is perhaps best {{illustrated}} {{with the fact that}} a Boeing 757 cannot taxi past another aircraft to parking positions. As a result, controllers are responsible not only for ensuring that valuable space is utilised, but also ensuring that other <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> kept circling until larger <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> parked. Despite these limitations, the airport successfully handles ten to twenty times more traffic than airports of a comparable size. It {{is for this reason that}} plans to relocate the airport are so important in the short-term scale. In 2006, a NIS 5.5 million renovation programme of Eilat Airport's terminal and runway was undertaken, designed to sustain the airport until it is replaced in the near future.|$|E
3000|$|... (i) The <b>{{aircraft}}</b> <b>is</b> {{known to}} the system. (ii) The aircraft has permission for runway. (iii) The <b>aircraft</b> <b>is</b> not assigned any runway. (iv) The <b>aircraft</b> <b>is</b> assigned a runway if the queue size does not exceed the limit.|$|R

50|$|The <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by Nikolai Polikarpov in 1928. 1,000 <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> manufactured for Aeroflot under the designation P-5. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> also {{taken into the}} Soviet Air Force's use in 1931. They operated 5,000 aircraft under the designation R-5.|$|R
5|$|A {{follow-up}} to , Battle for Naboo is a fast-paced, arcade-style action game. Each of the game's 15levels introduces mission objectives {{that must be}} completed to progress to the next level. Enemy <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> primarily composed of Trade Federation Droid starfighters and air mines. Ground defenses are more varied and include battle and destroyer droids, laser and missile turrets, Armored Assault Tanks (AATs), Multi-troop transports (MTTs), gunboats and Single trooper aerial platform (STAPs).|$|E
5|$|<b>Aircraft</b> <b>are</b> {{inspected}} during {{maintenance operations}} either outdoors on an airport between flights, or in a hangar for longer-duration inspections. These inspections are conducted mainly by human operators, visually and sometimes using tools to assess defects. The project aims to improve inspections of aircraft and traceability. A database dedicated to each aircraft type, containing images and three-dimensional scans, will be updated after each maintenance. This allows for example {{to assess the}} propagation of a crack.|$|E
5|$|As of June 2016, as {{the most}} used high bypass turbofan, it {{achieved}} more than 800million engine flight hours, and {{at a rate of}} one million flight hours every eight days it will achieve one billion flight hours by 2020. It has more than 550 operators and more than 2,400 CFM56-powered jet <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> in the air at any moment. It is known for its dependability: its average time on wing is 30,000 hours before a first shop visit, with the current fleet record at 50,000 hours.|$|E
50|$|Another seven <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> {{ordered by}} May 1933 {{but the company}} had been merged in 1932 with ASJ. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> {{thereafter}} produced and delivered by ASJA. As soon as the order had been received, manufacture began. The first <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> ready by November 1934. All <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> ready and were delivered by June 1935. The Swedish Air Force designated these aircraft J 6B.|$|R
25|$|As the RAF {{embarked}} on what became a substantial pre-war expansion programme, the Battle was promptly recognised {{as being a}} priority production target. Accordingly, there was at one point a total of 2,419 <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> on order for the service. In June 1937, the first <b>aircraft</b> <b>was</b> completed at Hayes; however, all subsequent <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> manufactured at Fairey's newly completed factory at Heaton Chapel, Stockport. Completed <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> promptly dispatched for testing at the company's facility adjacent to RAF Ringway, Manchester. A total of 1,156 <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> produced by Fairey.|$|R
50|$|Most CRJ <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> {{operated}} for Delta Connection, though 14 CRJ-200 <b>aircraft</b> <b>were</b> operated for United Express.|$|R
5|$|CAP {{performs}} several {{missions that}} are not combat-related {{in support of the}} United States Air Force, including damage assessment, transportation of officials, communications support and low-altitude route surveys. The CAP fleet is used in training exercises to prepare USAF pilots to intercept enemy aircraft over the Continental United States. Civil Air Patrol <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> flown into restricted airspace, where United States Air Force pilots may practice high-speed intercepts.|$|E
5|$|Commerce {{provides}} pilot reports along aircraft routes, {{and ship}} reports along shipping routes. Research flights using reconnaissance aircraft fly {{in and around}} weather systems of interest such as tropical cyclones. Reconnaissance <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> also flown over the open oceans during the cold season into systems that cause significant uncertainty in forecast guidance, or {{are expected to be}} of high impact 3–7 days into the future over the downstream continent.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the UK Ministry of Defence began {{studies for}} a GR1 Mid-Life Update (MLU). The update to GR4 standard, {{approved}} in 1994, would improve capability in the medium-altitude role based on {{lessons learned from}} the GR1's performance in the 1991 Gulf War. British Aerospace (later BAE Systems) upgraded 142 Tornado GR1s to GR4 standard, beginning in 1996 and finished in 2003. 59 RAF <b>aircraft</b> <b>are</b> receiving the CUSP avionics package which integrates the Paveway IV bomb and installs a new secure communications module from Cassidian in Phase A, followed by the Tactical Information Exchange (TIE) datalink from General Dynamics in Phase B.|$|E
