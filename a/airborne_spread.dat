50|$|Research in the Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006) {{provided}} evidence that L. pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, can travel at least 6 km from its source by <b>airborne</b> <b>spread.</b> It was previously believed that {{transmission of the}} bacterium was restricted to much shorter distances. A team of French scientists reviewed the details of an epidemic of Legionnaires' disease {{that took place in}} Pas-de-Calais, northern France, in 2003-2004. Of 86 confirmed cases during the outbreak, 18 resulted in death. The source of infection was identified as a cooling tower in a petrochemical plant, and an analysis of those affected in the outbreak revealed that some infected people lived as far as 6-7 km from the plant.|$|E
5000|$|The {{disease is}} {{primarily}} spread through contaminated seed or farm equipment, {{although it may}} also be carried short distances by the wind, especially following the burning of wheat fields. Evidence of the importance of airborne dispersal of Tilletia indica was demonstrated by Halasz et al. in 2014 when they discovered a strong correlation between teliospore concentration in the air above a wheat crop and the subsequent number of infected wheat kernels. The researchers concluded that this <b>airborne</b> <b>spread</b> of teliospores could also result in post-harvest disease development [...] The fungal spores can then remain viable for several years, germinating when weather conditions become favorable for development. [...] Once the spores germinate, they infest the wheat flowers and develop large masses of spores on the embryo end of the kernels (the entire kernel is not usually affected).|$|E

5000|$|In 2011, two {{laboratories}} {{published reports}} of mutational screens of avian influenza viruses, identifying variant which become transmissible {{through the air}} between ferrets. These viruses seem to overcome an obstacle which limits the global impact of natural H5N1. In 2012, scientists further screened point mutations of the H5N1 virus genome to identify mutations which allowed <b>airborne</b> <b>spread.</b> While the stated goal {{of this research was}} to improve surveillance and prepare for influenza viruses which are of particular risk in causing a pandemic, there was significant concern that the laboratory strains themselves could escape. Marc Lipsitch and Alison P.

They also quantified infectious virus in bio-aerosols and evaluated a method of biosecurity designed to reduce this risk. In addition, they identified meteorological risk factors associated with the presence of virus in bio-aerosols.

40|$|A {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} Monte-Carlo simulation model was developed to analyse the epidemiology and control of {{foot and mouth disease}} (FMD). Animal, people and vehicle contacts as well as airborne and local spread represented the FMD virus transmission between farms housing cattle, pigs or sheep. Contacts were explicitly modelled by routes, airborne transmission by the Gaussian Dispersion model and local spread by distance dependent transmission probabilities. Control measures were implemented according to the EU Directive (2003 / 85 /EG). A sensitivity analysis with a two-level fractional factorial design was used to examine the robustness of the simulation model to extreme input values. The influence of eleven input parameters and interactions between them were estimated: ability of <b>airborne</b> <b>spread,</b> duration of the incubation period, time from infection until infectivity, time from onset of clinical signs until diagnosis, farm density, type of index case, number of farms visited per route, visiting interval, type of the animal sales, control strategy, and delay until start of control strategies. The considered parameters as well as certain two-factor interactions between them showed {{a significant impact on the}} epidemic duration and the number of infected and culled farms. Particularly, the parameter <b>airborne</b> <b>spread,</b> farm density, number of farms visited per route and control strategy influenced the course of the epidemic. The consideration of <b>airborne</b> <b>spread</b> as well as the implementation of contacts between farms with routes allowed a detailed analysis of these transmission paths...|$|E

The minimal infectious dose of FMDV for different species by inhalation is an important determinant of <b>airborne</b> <b>spread.</b> Whereas the doses for cattle and sheep have been quantified, those for pigs are not known. The objective {{of the study was to}} obtain that data in order to enhance the capability of simulation models. Under experimental conditions, forty pigs were exposed individually to naturally generated aerosols of FMDV, strain O 1 Lausanne. The results indicated that doses under 100 TCID 50 failed to infect pigs but doses of approximately 300 TCID 50 caused short-term sub-clinical infection.

40|$|Although the {{compartmentalization}} {{of poultry}} industry components has substantial economic implications, {{and is therefore}} a concept with huge significance to poultry industries worldwide, the current requirements for compartment status are generic to all OIE member countries. We examined the consequences for potential outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the British poultry industry using a metapopulation modelling framework. This framework {{was used to assess}} the effectiveness of compartmentalization relative to zoning control, utilizing empirical data to inform the structure of potential epidemiological contacts within the British poultry industry via network links and spatial proximity. Conditions were identified where, despite the efficient isolation of poultry compartments through the removal of network-mediated links, spatially mediated <b>airborne</b> <b>spread</b> enabled spillover of infection with nearby premises making compartmentalization a more ‚Äòrisky‚Äô option than zoning control. However, when zoning control did not effectively inhibit long-distance network links, compartmentalization became a relatively more effective control measure than zoning.

40|$|Experimental dermatophytoses were induced in virgin and {{previously}} infected guinea pigs by the quantitated application of spores to plucked and shaved areas of skin. Lesions could be consistently induced without occlusion with 7 dermatophytes‚ÄîTrichophyton mentagrophytes, T. rubrum, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. gypseum, M. persicolor and Epidermophyton floccosum. The progress of lesions was monitored visually and their infectivity determined using a hair brush sampling technique. <b>Airborne</b> <b>spread</b> of fungal elements from infected animals to other animals {{housed in the}} same area and to the atmosphere was also examined. With 2 dermatophytes, T. mentagrophytes and M. canis, {{it was found that the}} infectivity of lesions correlated well with the clinical progress of the disease after primary infection and on reinfection. This was not the case with the other fungi investigated where factors such as absence of hair invasion, hair invasion wholly or mainly endothrix in nature, or the development of a thick scab which trapped hairs and fungal elements, resulted in the development of lesions of low infectivity. Dissemination of spores into the air and onto neighboring noncontact animals occurred readily with M. canis, and to a lesser degree with T. mentagrophytes. <b>Airborne</b> <b>spread</b> of fungal elements from lesions due to the other dermatophytes was negligible. On reinfection, some spores germinated and hyphal growth occurred but lesions appeared earlier, healed more rapidly and were markedly less infective.

40|$|The deadly {{infectious}} Ebola incidences scare {{not only}} to the residents of western Africa but also to the travelers and medical professionals who treat the patients, as they became victims. Since 27 July until 13 August 2014 alone, about 2, 127 Ebola cases occurred in just four Western African countries: Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone and more than 50 % of them died. The mortality is extremely higher. No known medication exists. Though the virus is not <b>airborne</b> <b>spreading,</b> a contact with the patient√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fluids, tissues, or bodies is known to transmit Ebola virus. There had been three categories: Suspected, probable, or confirmed in the collection of Ebola incidences and deaths. Their data are quite informative if they are properly processed and it is exactly the aim of this article. For this purpose, the stochastic nature of the data is probed rationally. The Ebola incidences and deaths in each category exhibit a separate Poisson chance environment and yet, they are connected. Therefore, suitable Poisson models are developed for each category and are then woven together to analyse the entire pertinent data on Ebola incidences and deaths in those four countries. Pictures are worth the thousand words to comprehend non-trivial findings. Hence, innovatively the data analytic concepts for three-dimensional sphere for each country is developed and applied. By superimposing the four spheres (one for each country), this article points out the relative performance of the four countries with respect to the Ebola incidences and deaths together in each category. One country does better than others in one category but poorly in other two categories. A better performance by a country is a reflection of effective prevention and successful medical treatment of Ebola cases...|$|R
