We agree, <b>as</b> <b>highlighted</b> <b>under</b> our study limitations, that the low participation rate in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) could affect the validity of the HbA 1 c sensitivity and specificity calculations. As women with lower HbA 1 c (particularly, 5. 6 % [38 mmol/mol]) were least likely to con-sent to an early OGTT, {{it is possible that the}} optimal HbA 1 c threshold for identify-ing women with undiagnosed preexisting diabetes (not gestational diabetes mel-litus [GDM]) is in fact lower than 5. 9...|$|E

40|$|The R package BioMark {{provides}} several {{tools to}} define which variables {{are associated with}} class differences in data from fields like metabolomics and proteomics. The first group of tools uses Higher Criticism to define an optimal threshold between interesting and non-interesting variables. This {{can be applied to}} any statistic, be it a t value, a regression coefficient or something else, and is related to the expected distribution of p values under the null distribution. The second group of tools is based on stability selection, i. e. an assessment of how often specific variables are <b>highlighted</b> <b>as</b> interesting <b>under</b> perturbation of the data. This approach is especially attractive when the number of samples is larger than, say, ten per group. Also in this case, the strategy can be applied to any type of statistic. Using real and simulated data, the application and usefulness of these techniques will be show...|$|R

[...] Stephen Thompson from The A.V. Club praised the track for being [...] "a breezy new single" [...] and [...] "infectious enough to surpass the direst moment of 'Under Rug Swept.'" [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song [...] "could even {{be seen as a}} sequel to 'You Oughta Know,'" [...] while Nikki Tranter of Popmatters compared the lyrical content on the song to her previous songs [...] "Plastic" [...] and [...] "Jealous," [...] from her first album, Alanis. Larry Flick of Billboard Magazine noted that the track shows Morissette proudly wearing her affection for concise, pure-pop hooks," [...] while Mark Blake of Q called it [...] "one of the album's peaks." [...] Kitty Empire of NME wrote a mixed review to the track, although calling it [...] "a tolerable enough tune, mind, for those who think their chocolate craving says something poignant about their inner selves." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Range {{scanners}} {{are used}} in various applications in industry. Therefore, various range scanners, based on different working principles are developed. Among these, scanners using stripe based triangulation are the most promising ones. Unfortunately, these scanners have problems in obtaining the range data of shiny objects (having <b>highlights)</b> <b>under</b> ambient light. In this study, we develop a stripe projection based range scanner to solve this problem. Our main contribution is on detecting the stripe using a color invariant in a robust manner. We developed a projector based scanner using this color invariant. Our scanner has also the advantage of flexibly changing stripe color for different colored objects. We test the performance of our novel stripe detection method under various controlled experiments. We also test the overall performance of our scanner in extracting the range data of several objects having highlights. Extensive testings indicate {{the success of our}} range scanner, especially for scanning objects having <b>highlights</b> <b>under</b> ambient light. I...|$|R
