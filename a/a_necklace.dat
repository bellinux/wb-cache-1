The lighting fixtures used for the concert were from Clay Paky and the main idea was to create an immersive rave experience with the lights.

5|$|In {{order to}} protect {{themselves}} and their livestock against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use a so-called Elf cross (Alfkors, Älvkors or Ellakors), which was carved into buildings or other objects. It existed in two shapes, one was a pentagram {{and it was still}} frequently used in early 20th-century Sweden as painted or carved onto doors, walls and household utensils in {{order to protect}} against elves. The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate. This second kind of elf cross was worn as a pendant in <b>a</b> <b>necklace</b> and in order to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver, from nine different sources of inherited silver. In some locations it also had to be on the altar of a church for three consecutive Sundays.|$|E

5|$|Shaw is {{the only}} {{religious}} believer in the crew and openly displays her religious belief with <b>a</b> <b>necklace</b> of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she {{was created by the}} Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers. In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that Prometheus is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and faith in God can co-exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{jewellery}} {{consists of}} three gold pendants, two glass beads, one gold wire bead, and a fragment of a jet hair pin. The pendants and beads all {{seem to have been}} strung together, probably forming <b>a</b> <b>necklace</b> that was in place around the neck of the body. Two of the pieces consist of gold cabochon pendants inset with jewels, while the third is a very elaborate shield-shaped jewel inlaid with 57 red garnets and a larger scallop-shaped gem in the centre. The garnets rest on a thin layer of gold leaf to reflect the light and increase their luminosity. It may have been created from recycled older pieces of jewellery, as the size, shape and thickness of the individuals garnet are all different.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the episode is an homage to Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, one subplot of which {{involves}} the corruption and downfall of a union leader during a strike.

He wears <b>a</b> <b>necklace</b> of tulsi-beads, embedded with the legendary kaustubha gem, and makara-kundala (fish-shaped earrings) that the poet-saint Tukaram {{relates to the}} iconography of Vishnu. Pandharpur's Vithoba holds a shankha (conch) {{in his left hand}} and a chakra (discus) or lotus flower in his right, all of which are symbols traditionally associated with Vishnu. Some images depict Vithoba's right hand making a gesture that has been traditionally misunderstood as a blessing; no gesture of blessing is present in the Pandharpur image. Though usually depicted two-armed, four-armed representations of the deity also exist.|$|E
5|$|A more {{coherent}} Walter explains that, {{according to}} the Observer September, the Observers made the Earth uninhabitable by 2609, and so traveled {{back in time to}} take over the planet themselves. As forces corner the three, Walter sets up an antimatter device to wipe out the Massive Dynamic building and their pursuers. Walter is able to lead Simon and Etta to where Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) and William Bell have been encased in amber. They are able to free Astrid, but as Fringe forces approach they find the equipment to free the others has malfunctioned. Simon sacrifices himself to the amber in order to push Peter free, while Walter severs Bell's hand for an unknown purpose. They escape the area as Broyles and his team arrive, though Broyles finds a piece of licorice, a telltale sign of Walter's presence. As the group travels away from the city, Walter, in an ominous manner, reminds Astrid of what Bell did to Olivia (Anna Torv). Peter then comes to recognize Etta as his daughter, Henrietta, wearing a fired bullet as <b>a</b> <b>necklace.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{found in}} colonial-era texts {{such as one}} by John Murraya missionary in British India and Jainism scholar, states the main image carved in Cave5 {{is that of a}} Jaina figure. According to a third theory, by Henry Cousens and A.Sundaraarchaeologists, and {{supported}} by local legends, the statue is of an ancient king; in a photograph of the statue taken before its face was damaged, the figure lacked the Ushnisha lump that typically goes with Buddha's image. The statue has several unusual, non-Buddha ornaments such as rings for fingers, <b>a</b> <b>necklace</b> and a chest-band; it wears a Hindu Yajnopavita thread and its head is stylistically closer to a Jina head than a Buddha head. These features suggest the statue may be of a king represented with features of various traditions. According to Carol Radcliffe BolonAssistant Curator at the Smithsonian Freer Gallery of Art, the date and identity of the main statue in Cave5 remains enigmatic.|$|E
