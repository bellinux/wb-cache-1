5|$|Mimesis is practised by {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon, Phycodurus eques, and the leaf scorpionfish, Taenianotus triacanthus, which {{resemble}} parts of plants, and gently rock their bodies as if swayed by a current. In the fish species Novaculichthys taeniourus, the rockmover or dragon wrasse, there is a striking difference in appearance between the adults and the juveniles. A juvenile Rockmover resembles a loose piece of sea weed. It swims in a vertical position with its head pointing downwards, and behaves {{in a way that}} perfectly resembles the movement of a piece of seaweed: moving back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surge, as if it was inanimate.|$|E
5|$|The pupae of some moths {{are able}} to wriggle their abdomen. The three caudal {{segments}} of the pupal abdomen (segments 8–10) are fixed; the other segments are movable to some degree. While the more evolved Lepidoptera can wriggle only the last two-three segments {{at the end of}} the abdomen, more basal taxa such as the Micropterigidae can wriggle the remaining seven segments of the abdomen; this presumably helps them to protrude the anterior end from the pupal case before eclosion. The pupae of Hepialidae {{are able to}} move back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> larval tunnel by wriggling, aided by projections on the back in addition to spines. Abdominal wriggling is considered to be of startle value and discouraging to predators. In the case of a few hawk moths, such as Theretra latreillii, the wriggling of the abdomens is accompanied by a rattling or clicking sound which adds to the startle effect.|$|E

5|$|For 1654, the Ottomans marshaled their strength: the Arsenal (Tersâne-i Âmire) in the Golden Horn {{produced}} new warships, and squadrons from Tripolitania and Tunis {{arrived to}} strengthen the Ottoman fleet. The strengthened Ottoman fleet that sailed forth from the Dardanelles in early May numbered 79 ships (40 sailing ships, 33 galleys and 6 galleasses), and further 22 galleys from around the Aegean and 14 ships from Barbary stood by to reinforce it off the Straits. This force considerably outnumbered the 26 ships of the Venetian blockade fleet under Giuseppe Dolfin. Although the battle that followed resulted in an Ottoman victory, for the Venetians, given the successful escape of their fleet from the superior Ottoman force, coupled with reports of large Ottomans casualties and the great bravery displayed by the Venetian crews, it counted as a moral victory. The Ottoman fleet, now reinforced by the Aegean and Barbary squadrons, plundered the Venetian island of Tinos, but retreated after only a brief skirmish with the Venetians under Alvise Mocenigo on 21 June. Kara Murad Pasha succeeded in evading the Venetians {{for the remainder of}} the year, with both fleets sailing back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Aegean, before returning to the Dardanelles in September due to agitation among the fleet's Janissaries. The final months of 1654 were marked by a significant change in the Venetian leadership: Mocenigo died at Candia, and was succeeded as acting Captain General of the Sea by Francesco Morosini, who had distinguished himself in the previous battles.|$|E

25|$|Islamic {{tradition}} {{states that}} the Zamzam Well was revealed to Hajra, the second wife of Abraham and mother of Ishmael. By the instruction of God, Abraham left {{his wife and son}} at a spot in the desert and walked away. She was desperately seeking water for her infant son, but she could not find any, as Mecca is located in a hot dry valley with few sources of water. Hajra ran seven times back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scorching heat between the two hills of Safa and Marwah, looking for water. Getting thirstier by the second, the infant Ishmael scraped the land with his feet, where suddenly water sprang out. There are other versions of the story involving God sending his angel, Gabriel (Jibra'il), who kicked the ground with his heel (or wing), and the water rose. A similar story about a well is also mentioned in the Bible.|$|E
25|$|The show's set {{included}} {{a door in}} the background. During the show, Sales would answer {{a knock at the}} door and interact with an actor seen only as an arm. Occasionally, the person at the door was a celebrity, such as Burt Lancaster or Fess Parker. Once, while the show was being broadcast live from Detroit, Sales' studio crew pulled a prank on him: when he opened the door, he saw a topless dancer partially covered with a balloon. Some reports say the gag was furthered by the crew switching the studio monitors so that Sales would think the stripper image was going out over the air. A second, nonbroadcasting, camera captured the uncensored version, while a stagehand moved a balloon back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> doorway, giving at least some indication to the home viewers what was supposed to be behind the door. Sales was forced to try to keep the show going without revealing the risque scene backstage. The prank was recreated when the show originated in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles prank footage survives.|$|E

[...] Charlotte was an enthusiastic Whig, as her father had been. [...] However, now that he was exercising the powers of the monarchy, he did not recall the Whigs to office as many had expected him to do. Charlotte was outraged by what she saw as her father's treason, and, at the opera, demonstrated her support by blowing kisses {{in the direction of the}} Whig leader, Earl Grey.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{progresses}} mostly through footage streamed from a fixed {{camera in}} booth {{nine of the}} call centre setting. Streams from other cameras are displayed {{on the side of}} the screen, in the style of a CCTV feed. The idea was inspired by a clip of a serial killer's interview with the CIA which Shearsmith had seen online; this, too, had a main feed with three smaller feeds giving different views of the scene. The writers felt that the multiple screens both served a narrative function and raised the tension. For much of the episode, viewers simply watch characters taking calls. Extras are seen moving back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> smaller screens, with Pemberton having initially been keen for things to be happening away from the main feed. However, he was somewhat frustrated with the result, with the same extra moving on numerous occasions throughout the episode. Shearsmith felt that a whole series filmed in the same manner [...] "would be a bit wearing on the eye", but that the style could be used for a single episode.|$|E

2500|$|The Moon train {{starts with}} gear b1 and {{proceeds}} through c1, c2, d1, d2, e2, e5, k1, k2, e6, e1, and b3 {{to the moon}} pointer on the front face. The gears k1 and k2 form an epicyclic gear system; they are an identical pair of gears that don't mesh, but rather, they operate face-to-face, with a short pin on k1 inserted into a slot in k2. The two gears have different centres of rotation, so the pin must move back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slot. That increases and decreases the radius at which k2 is driven, also necessarily varying its angular velocity (presuming the velocity of k1 is even) faster {{in some parts of}} the rotation than others. [...] Over an entire revolution the average velocities are the same, but the fast-slow variation models the effects of the elliptical orbit of the moon, in consequence of Kepler's second and third laws. The modelled rotational period of the moon pointer (averaged over a year) is 27.321 days, compared to the modern length of a lunar sidereal month of 27.321661 days. As mentioned, the pin/slot driving of the k1/k2 gears varies the displacement over a year's time, and the mounting of those two gears on the e3 gear supplies a precessional advancement to the ellipticity modelling with a period of 8.8826 years, compared with the current value of precession period of the moon of 8.85 years.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2004, NBC {{executive}} Marc Graboff informed Ross of the conversations, and he in turn ran {{the idea}} of waiting four more years to O'Brien, who was immediately receptive. Zucker, along with top late-night executive Rick Ludwin, met with Leno in March at his Burbank studio to discuss the contract extension, and explained the network's stance on handing over the show to O'Brien. While Leno quietly felt both disappointed and befuddled, he noted {{he did not want}} to see himself and O'Brien go through the same dilemma he and Letterman faced twelve years earlier, and agreed to the plans. His only request was that NBC wait to announce O'Brien's installment as host well after the extension, to which the executives agreed. While Leno handled the news professionally (to Zucker's relief), he soon headed to Tonight Show producer Debbie Vickers' office to let her know he felt as if he had just been fired. NBC's announcement of the renewal inevitably led to press speculation on O'Brien's fate; to that end, O'Brien and his team went with the charade, peppering interviews with unclear, vague statements on his future. On September 27, 2004, O'Brien officially signed on to become the next host of The Tonight Show; NBC allowed the first comment aside from the press release to come from Leno on that night's show. [...] "'Cause this, you know, this show is like a dynasty,” Leno said. “You hold it, and then you hand it off to the next person. And I don’t want to see all the fighting and all the 'Who’s better?' and nasty things back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> press. So right now, here it is—Conan, it's yours!

2500|$|There {{was some}} {{question}} {{heading into the}} women's qualifications which of Aly Raisman, Laurie Hernandez, and defending Olympic All Around Champion Douglas would {{get a chance to}} qualify for the All Around finals, since the first spot in the finals clearly belonged to Simone Biles. Aly and Laurie had been battling back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> All Around all year. [...] Douglas, despite trailing Aly and Laurie in the All Around throughout the year was considered very strong on the uneven bars, the event that someone would be required to sit out to make way for bars specialist Madison Kocian. [...] Due to her weakness on uneven bars many speculated Aly would be the one to miss out on an All Around opportunity but her strong performances in podium training on all events, and an injury to Laurie Hernandez, meant it would be Laurie to sit out uneven bars, giving Aly the chance to qualify to the All Around. [...] During the first night of women's gymnastics competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics, Raisman and the U.S. women qualified into the team final in first place with a score of 185.238, almost 10 points ahead of the second-place qualifying team. Individually, Raisman qualified second to the all-around final (with a score of 60.607, behind teammate Biles), just edging out defending Olympic All Around winner Douglas who also performed extremely well, placing 3rd behind Raisman but being bumped due to the 2 per country rule. [...] Aly also qualified to the floor exercise final (with a score of 15.275, again behind Biles), where she was the defending Olympic champion from the London Games. [...] She also posted one of the highest beam scores in qualification, an event she was the defending Olympic bronze medalist, but due to the two-per-country rule was bumped from event finals by her teammates Simone Biles and Laurie Hernandez.|$|E
