40|$|Electronic {{properties}} of Pu intermetallics were traditionally understood as {{dominated by the}} Pu-Pu spacing. While very low spacing should lead to formation of a 5 f band, its increase should drive the system to strong e-e correlation regime and eventually to a magnetic order. The large difference between the Sommerfeld coefficient of electronic specific heat , being 17 mJ/mol K 2 for -Pu and 64 mJ/mol K 2 for -Pu 1 (40 mJ/mol K 2 given later) was understood in this framework. However, theoretical works over last years indicated that relatively small variations of 5 f occupancy can have equally (or perhaps more) important effect on magnetic and other properties. A possibility to test whether the Pu-Pu spacing plays only a secondary role is to check {{properties of}} Pu systems with low Pu-Pu spacing for occurrence of species with high value of  and magnetic susceptibility. We investigated several U-Pu alloys, forming a high-density -phase, and showed that -values reach the range of -Pu. Magnetic susceptibility (T) even higher. Most recently we turned the attention to -Pu, which may actually be the most strongly correlated Pu phase. The monoclinic structure of -Pu cannot be stabilized to low T by doping, but we noticed that the crystal structure of Pu 19 Os (especially its high-T variety -Pu 19 Os) is almost identical as to volume and coordination. The reported room-temperature density 18. 02 g/cm 3 is only slightly {{lower than that of}} -Pu, if the 2 latter is corrected for the thermal expansion (18. 20 g/cm 3), and is very different from those of -Pu (19. 82 g/cm 3) or -Pu (15. 92 g/cm 3). This phase was found thermodynamically stable between 468 and 707 K. Below that range, the structure transforms into the other variety, -Pu 19 Os, with structure of slightly higher density (18. 12 g/cm 3). We succeeded to synthesize both phases. (T) weakly increases with decreasing T for both phases, from 8 * 10 - 9 m 3 /mol Pu at 300 K to 9 * 10 - 9 m 3 /mol Pu in the low-T limit (higher than for - and -Pu, both of 6 - 7 * 10 - 9 m 3 /mol). T- dependence of specific heat exhibits quite a non-Debye type of behaviour, similar to -Pu alloys. 1, 2 The lowest T achieved (< 4 K) was nevertheless sufficient to extrapolate reliably to T  0. The obtained 's, (55  2) mJ/mol Pu K 2 for -Pu 19 Os and (74  2) mJ/mol Pu K 2 for -Pu 19 Os, are considerably higher than for -Pu. The slopes of the Cp/T vs. T 2 plot, which determine the Debye temperatures, are even higher than for -Pu. It reveals D even lower than for -Pu, but the values D = 96 K for -Pu 19 Os and 101 K for Pu 19 Os in fact fall within the spread of -Pu stabilized by 6. 1 % Ce (103 K) and by 8 % Am (95 K). The results show that the Pu properties are not primarily controlled by the Pu-Pu spacing and the description cannot be based on the 5 f-band approach only.

40|$|The TCABR data {{analysis}} and acquisition {{system has been}} upgraded to support a joint research programme using remote participation technologies. The architecture {{of the new system}} uses Java language as programming environment. Since application parameters and hardware in a joint experiment are complex with a large variability of components, requirements and specification solutions need to be flexible and modular, independent from operating system and computer architecture. To describe and organize the information on all the components and the connections among them, systems are developed using the extensible Markup Language (XML) technology. The communication between clients and servers uses remote procedure call (RPC) based on the XML (RPC-XML technology). The integration among Java language, XML and RPC-XML technologies allows to develop easily a standard data and communication access layer between <b>users</b> and <b>laboratories</b> using common software libraries and Web application. The libraries allow data retrieval using the same methods for all <b>user</b> <b>laboratories</b> in the joint collaboration, and the Web application allows a simple graphical user interface (GUI) access.

40|$|The Israeli Tandem Electrostatic Accelerator FEL (EA-FEL), {{which is}} based on an {{electrostatic}} Van der Graaff accelerator was relocated to Ariel 3 years ago, and has now returned to operation under a new configuration. In the present FEL, the millimeter-wave radiation generated in the resonator is separated from the electron beam by means of a perforated Talbot effect reflector. A quasi-optic delivery system transmits the out-coupled power through a window in the pressurized gas accelerator tank into the measurement room (in the previous configuration, radiation was transmitted through the accelerator tubes with 40 dB attenuation). This makes it possible to transmit useful power out of the accelerator and into the <b>user</b> <b>laboratories.</b> After re-configuring the FEL electron gun and the e-beam transport optics and installing a two stage depressed collector, the e-beam current was raised to 2 A.

40|$|SUMMARY. A {{commercial}} semi-quantitative kit (Trace) for urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) {{in which}} urine is pre-treated with ion-exchange resin and the colour of the Ehrlich-PBG adduct matched against {{a set of}} surrogate standards was compared with qualitative screening methods (Watson-Schwartz) in common use. Twenty samples in which PBG had been quantitated were blindly tested by both methods in each of 13 typical <b>user</b> <b>laboratories.</b> For urine samples with raised PBG, 123 out of 129 results were positive when tested with the Trace kit. Using qualitative tests routinely in use in the various laboratories only 45 out of 119 results were unequivocally positive. Sixteen out of 91 results for pigmented urine samples with normal PBG were reported as positive using qualitative screening tests, but only one using the Trace kit. Therefore, the Trace method is far more sensitive and specific than the qualitative screening tests. It is recommended that Watson-Schwartz-type screening tests should be abandoned and, ideally, all urine samples analysed by quantitative methods. However, the Trace method is a convenient alternative which is adequate for the initial screening of symptomatic patients...|$|R

New contraceptive methods have been developed to try to improve adherence in this group of patients. the study was conducted to evaluate the bleeding pattern, efficacy and discontinuation rate of etonogestrel implant (68 mg) inserted in postpartum adolescents. Study Design: the study population comprised 44 postpartum adolescents managed at the Family Planning Sector of São Paulo Federal University. the implant was inserted, on average, 102 days after delivery. Patients were followed prospectively during four 90 -day periods. Results: All 44 patients completed the 12 months of follow-up, resulting in a study discontinuation rate of 0 %. No implants were removed. There were no pregnancies during the study. After 1 year of use, frequent and prolonged bleeding were reported by less than 5 % of the patients and amenorrhea occurred in 38. 6 % of the <b>users.</b> <b>Laboratory</b> parameters indicated a significant increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit among users.
