5|$|Gout {{is partly}} genetic, {{contributing}} to about 60% of variability in uric <b>acid</b> <b>level.</b> The SLC2A9, SLC22A12 and ABCG2 genes {{have been found}} to be commonly associated with gout and variations in them can approximately double the risk. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. The rare genetic disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout.|$|E
5|$|The {{mortality}} rate from paracetamol overdose increases {{two days after}} the ingestion, reaches a maximum on day four, and then gradually decreases. Acidosis is the most important single indicator of probable mortality and the need for transplantation. A {{mortality rate}} of 95% without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented pH less than 7.30. Other indicators of poor prognosis include renal insufficiency (stage3 or worse), hepatic encephalopathy, a markedly elevated prothrombin time, or an elevated blood lactic <b>acid</b> <b>level</b> (lactic acidosis). One study has shown that a factor V level less than 10% of normal indicated a poor prognosis (91% mortality), whereas a ratio of factor VIII to factor V of less than 30 indicated a good prognosis (100% survival). Patients with a poor prognosis are usually identified for likely liver transplantation. Patients that do not die are expected to fully recover and have a normal life expectancy and quality of life.|$|E
5|$|While {{many sources}} {{recommend}} additional intravenous agents to reduce {{damage to the}} kidney, most of the evidence supporting this practice comes from animal studies, and is inconsistent and conflicting. Mannitol acts by osmosis to enhance urine production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in the kidney, but its efficacy has not been shown in studies {{and there is a}} risk of worsening kidney function. The addition of bicarbonate to the intravenous fluids may alleviate acidosis (high <b>acid</b> <b>level</b> of the blood) and make the urine more alkaline to prevent cast formation in the kidneys; evidence suggesting that bicarbonate has benefits above saline alone is limited, and it can worsen hypocalcemia by enhancing calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues. If urine alkalinization is used, the pH of the urine is kept at 6.5 or above. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is often used to ensure sufficient urine production, but evidence that this prevents kidney failure is lacking.|$|E

This study aimed to assess the clinical utility of serum uric <b>acid</b> <b>levels</b> to identify patients at high risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in those who presented to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain. This was a prospective observational study of 951 adult patients who were being evaluated for ACS in a single ED. Serum uric acid was taken on presentation. Patients were followed up 30 days and 1 year after initial presentation. The primary outcome was a diagnosis of ACS within 30 days of initial attendance. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify whether elevated uric <b>acid</b> <b>levels</b> were predictive of ACS. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to identify 1 -year mortality in those who were available for 1 -year follow-up and Cox regression was performed to identify whether uric <b>acid</b> <b>levels</b> were an independent predictor of mortality. ACS was diagnosed in 88 patients and 140 patients had elevated uric <b>acid</b> <b>levels.</b> A total of 679 patients agreed to 1 -year follow-up. Elevated uric <b>acid</b> <b>levels</b> were not associated with a diagnosis of ACS (p = 0. 96). Patients with elevated uric acid had a higher 1 -year death rate (8 / 101; 7. 92 %) compared with patients with normal uric <b>acid</b> <b>levels</b> (12 / 596; 2. 01 %, p < 0. 01). Uric <b>acid</b> <b>levels</b> lack diagnostic utility for ACS but may be useful for identifying ED patients with chest pain who are at high risk for 1 -year mortality.

The drug allopurinol is utilized to stop the conversion of oxypurines into uric acid, and prevent the development of subsequent arthritic tophi (produced after having chronic gout), kidney stones, and nephropathy, the resulting kidney disease. Allopurinol is taken orally, at a typical dose of 3–20mg/kg per day. The dose is then adjusted to bring the uric <b>acid</b> <b>level</b> down into the normal range (<3nbsp&mg/dL).

25|$|Milstein's {{early work}} on {{antibodies}} {{focused on the}} nature of their diversity at the amino <b>acid</b> <b>level</b> {{as well as on the}} disulphide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted polypeptides that contained a signal sequence. The development of the hybridoma technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing then allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody affinity maturation. In this process, localised mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved antibodies which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterising this mutational process with a view to understanding its mechanism and, indeed, he contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Telomerase {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the cellular immortalization of cancers. It contains telomerase RNA, telomerase reverse transcriptase. Sialic acid consolidates the cellular membrane and plays a role in the maintenance of intercellular activity. Telomerase activity and sialic <b>acid</b> <b>levels</b> may be used to predict the biological behavior of C 6 rat glioma cell lines. Materials and Methods: Telomerase activity and sialic <b>acid</b> <b>levels</b> were investigated in consecutive cell line pas¬sages in cell extracts taken from C 6 rat glioma cell line. Both telomerase activity and sialic <b>acid</b> <b>levels</b> were deter¬mined in the 3 rd, 6 lh, 9, 12 th and 15 th passages. To detect telomerase activity, cell lysate was extracted by lysis buffer, and telomeric repeat amplification protocol was performed, using a PCR-based TRAP TeloTAGGG Te¬lomerase PCR ELISA PLUS plus kit. To examine sialic <b>acid</b> <b>levels,</b> a Sialic <b>Acid</b> Quantification Kit was used in the same passages that had been used for measurements of te¬lomerase activity.
