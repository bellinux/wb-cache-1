5|$|The {{atmospheric}} pressure decreases with altitude, {{and this has}} an effect on the <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> of the diving environment. The most important effect is that the diver must decompress to a lower surface pressure, and this requires longer decompression for the same dive profile.|$|E

25|$|Automotive engine {{management}} systems use piezoelectric transducers to detect Engine knock (Knock Sensor, KS), {{also known as}} detonation, at certain hertz frequencies.

25|$|The above {{equations}} suggest {{there is}} a flow speed at which pressure is zero, and at even higher speeds the pressure is negative. Most often, gases and liquids are not capable of negative <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure,</b> or even zero pressure, so clearly Bernoulli's equation ceases to be valid before zero pressure is reached. In liquids – when the pressure becomes too low – cavitation occurs. The above equations use a linear relationship between flow speed squared and pressure. At higher flow speeds in gases, or for sound waves in liquid, the changes in mass density become significant so that the assumption of constant density is invalid.|$|E

50|$|For most working fluids where a fluid {{exists in}} a closed system, gauge {{pressure}} measurement prevails. Pressure instruments connected to the system will indicate pressures relative to the current atmospheric pressure.

25|$|English chemist Robert Boyle (1627–1691) is {{considered}} to have refined the modern scientific method for alchemy and to have separated chemistry further from alchemy. Although his research clearly {{has its roots in}} the alchemical tradition, Boyle is largely regarded today as the first modern chemist, and therefore one of the founders of modern chemistry, and one of the pioneers of modern experimental scientific method. Although Boyle was not the original discover, he is best known for Boyle's law, which he presented in 1662: the law describes the inversely proportional relationship between the <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> and volume of a gas, if the temperature is kept constant within a closed system.|$|E
25|$|When {{describing}} {{a container of}} gas, the term pressure (or <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure)</b> refers to the average force per unit area that the gas exerts {{on the surface of}} the container. Within this volume, it is sometimes easier to visualize the gas particles moving in straight lines until they collide with the container (see diagram at top of the article). The force imparted by a gas particle into the container during this collision is the change in momentum of the particle. During a collision only the normal component of velocity changes. A particle traveling parallel to the wall does not change its momentum. Therefore, the average force on a surface must be the average change in linear momentum from all of these gas particle collisions.|$|E
25|$|A {{large part}} of Albert A. Bühlmann's {{research}} {{was to determine the}} longest half time compartments for Nitrogen and Helium, and he increased the number of compartments to 16. He investigated the implications of decompression after diving at altitude and published decompression tables that could be used at a range of altitudes. Bühlmann used a method for decompression calculation similar to that proposed by Workman, which included M-values expressing a linear relationship between maximum inert gas pressure in the tissue compartments and ambient pressure, but based on <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure,</b> which made them more easily adapted for altitude diving. Bühlmann's algorithm was used to generate the standard decompression tables for a number of sports diving associations, and is used in several personal decompression computers, sometimes in a modified form.|$|E

25|$|Constant {{mass flow}} {{addition}} valves {{are used to}} supply a constant mass flow of fresh gas to an active type semi-closed rebreather to replenish the gas used by the diver and to maintain an approximately constant composition of the loop mix. Two main types are used: the fixed orifice and the adjustable orifice (usually a needle valve). The constant mass flow valve is usually based on a gas regulator that is isolated from the ambient pressure so that it provides an <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> regulated output (not compensated for ambient pressure). This limits the depth range in which constant mass flow is possible through the orifice, but provides a relatively predictable gas mixture in the breathing loop. An over-pressure relief valve {{in the first stage}} is used to protect the output hose. Unlike most other diving regulators, these do not control the downstream pressure, but they do regulate the flow rate.|$|E
25|$|Unsaturated {{conditions}} occur {{above the}} water table where the pressure head is negative (<b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> can never be negative, but gauge pressure can) and the water that incompletely fills the pores of the aquifer material is under suction. The water content in the unsaturated zone is {{held in place by}} surface adhesive forces and it rises {{above the water}} table (the zero-gauge-pressure isobar) by capillary action to saturate a small zone above the phreatic surface (the capillary fringe) at less than atmospheric pressure. This is termed tension saturation and {{is not the same as}} saturation on a water-content basis. Water content in a capillary fringe decreases with increasing distance from the phreatic surface. The capillary head depends on soil pore size. In sandy soils with larger pores, the head will be less than in clay soils with very small pores. The normal capillary rise in a clayey soil is less than 1.80 m (six feet) but can range between 0.3 and 10 m (one and 30ft).|$|E
25|$|The blended gases at {{the intake}} to the {{compressor}} {{will be at}} a pressure slightly below ambient, due to losses in the blending tube. This may make it impracticable to use some types of analysis instruments, which rely on a flow of gas through the instrument driven by {{the pressure of the}} measured gas. Oxygen cells are also sensitive to a pressure drop, as they directly measure partial pressure, and this may lead to a mix richer than intended, as the oxygen flow may be set to the partial pressure appropriate for atmospheric pressure, while the measured mixture is at a lower pressure. This can be compensated by using a small sampling pump drawing gas from the blending tupe and delivering it to the instruments, or by allowing for the reduced inlet pressure for oxygen analysis with an in-line sensor cell. This would require a vacuum gauge measuring the pressure drop or abbsolute pressure at the sensor. Partial pressure of oxygen must be correct as a fraction of <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> at the point of measurement.|$|E
