5|$|Beginning {{with the}} rapid {{industrial}} growth that began in Indiana during the gas boom of the late 19th-century, labor unions began to form with goals of increasing wages and providing other benefits to workers through collective bargaining. The Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company was founded to own and operate the streetcar terminal in downtown Indianapolis, and operate the Indianapolis Street Railway under a lease agreement for a term of 31 years. In 1892 the employees of Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company launched a short-lived strike. The company was the primary public transportation provider in Indianapolis and operated the central transportation hub {{for the city of}} Indianapolis and state of Indiana. The company offered small concessions, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> returned to work without unionizing.|$|E
5|$|However, {{fulfilling}} these promises proves {{costly and}} Mayor Quimby denounces Homer for spending the department's yearly budget {{in only a}} month. Homer gets cities all over the United States to pay him to store their excess garbage into an abandoned mine shaft {{on the outskirts of}} Springfield. Despite the budget crisis having ended <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> receiving their salaries as promised, the garbage builds up underground and eventually erupts, pouring trash all over the town. At a town hall meeting, Homer is fired from his post and replaced with Ray Patterson, who declines reinstatement. With no other options left, Quimby moves the entire town five miles down the road.|$|E
5|$|P.exclamans are haplodiploid insects, as {{are other}} Polistes species {{including}} Polistes metricus, Polistes dominula, and Polistes annularis. This means they have haploid males that produce identical haploid sperm, and diploid females that produce haploid eggs through meiosis. This has consequences for genetic relatedness within colonies, since sisters receive identical sperm if {{they share a}} father, and the normal half identical contribution from the mother. This results in sex-biased conflicts between the queen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> {{with respect to the}} sex ratio, with workers preferring a more female biased sex ratio, and queens preferring equal investment in queens and males.|$|E

5|$|P.exclamans {{tend to have}} smaller nests {{than other}} wasps, with {{typically}} fewer than one hundred individuals in a given nest. Because {{of the size of}} the nest, the queen tends to be the most active individual in the nest. This is because the queen has to monitor and directly control the activities of the nest. In addition to her reproductive role, the queen must also act as the pacemaker of the nest and synchronize the worker activity. These last two points have recently been disputed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> may be self organized. It has also been observed that the queen will act aggressively towards individuals that are the least active.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{establish}} an administration was initiated by Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld in 1871. After contacting the invested governments, {{he concluded that}} only Russia and Norway would object to an annexation of the island. Fridtjof Nansen's endeavors raised the Norwegian public's consciousness of the Arctic, which again brought forth public support for annexation of Svalbard. Industrialization and permanent settlements on Svalbard began in the 1900s {{with the introduction of}} coal mining. This resulted in the need for jurisdiction. Firstly, there was no means to make a mining claim legal. Secondly, there was a need for conflict resolution, particularly regarding labor conflicts, which often saw the mining company <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> have different nationalities.|$|E
5|$|As the Great War progressed, war {{exhaustion}} in Germany grew. The first {{strikes in}} the country {{since the start of}} the war broke out in 1915, steadily increasing in frequency and magnitude. The unions' role as troubleshooter between the employers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> soon led to conflict between the membership and union officials, and the Free Trade Unions steadily lost members. Correspondingly, the Reichstag faction of the SPD split over continued support for the war. The 1917 February Revolution in Russia was seen by the FVdG as an expression of the people's desire for peace. The syndicalists paid special attention to the role the general strike (which they had been advocating for years) played in the revolution. They were unable to comment on the October Revolution as the Rundschreiben had been banned by the time it broke out.|$|E

5|$|Fluor {{has been}} working on the cleanup and {{shutdown}} of atomic energy plants in Ohio and Washington since the 1990s. In 1992, Fluor won a contract with the United States Energy Department to clean up nuclear waste. By 1996 Hanford was the most contaminated nuclear site in the US and the US Department of Energy was conducting a $50 billion to $60 billion cleanup of the site. Fluor Hanford Inc. replaced Westinghouse Hanford Co. on the project. After a chemical explosion in 1997, 11 workers filed a lawsuit alleging they were denied appropriate medical attention and protective gear. Fluor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> disagreed on whether the explosion resulted in any injuries. In 2005 the US Department of Energy fined Fluor for safety violations and that same year a jury awarded $4.7 million in damages to 11 pipe fitters that claimed they were fired after complaining that a valve rated for 1,975 pounds-per-inch was being used where 2,235 were needed.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Himmler {{founded the}} first SS {{business}} venture, Nordland-Verlag, a publishing house that released propaganda material and SS training manuals. Thereafter, he purchased Allach Porcelain, which {{then began to}} produce SS memorabilia. Because of the labor shortage and a desire for financial gain, the SS started exploiting concentration camp inmates as slave labor. Most of the SS businesses lost money until Himmler placed them under the administration of Pohl's Verwaltung und Wirtschaftshauptamt Hauptamt (Administration and Business office; VuWHA) in 1939. Even then, most of the enterprises were poorly run and did not fare well, as SS men were not selected for their business experience, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> were starving. In July 1940 Pohl established the Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe GmbH (German Businesses Ltd; DWB), an umbrella corporation under which he took over administration of all SS business concerns. Eventually the SS founded nearly 200 holding companies for their businesses.|$|E
5|$|In 393 BC, Conon and Pharnabazus {{sailed to}} {{mainland}} Greece, where they raided {{the coast of}} Laconia and seized the island of Cythera, where they left a garrison and an Athenian governor. They then sailed to Corinth, where they distributed money and urged {{the members of the}} council to show the Persian king that they were trustworthy. Pharnabazus then dispatched Conon with substantial funds and {{a large part of the}} fleet to Attica, where he joined in the rebuilding of the long walls from Athens to Piraeus, a project that had been initiated by Thrasybulus in 394 BC. With the assistance of the rowers of the fleet, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> paid for by the Persian money, the construction was soon completed. Athens quickly took advantage of its possession of walls and a fleet to seize the islands of Scyros, Imbros, and Lemnos, on which it established cleruchies (citizen colonies).|$|E

5|$|Myrmecia {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} genera of ants. Myrmecia ants usually display {{defensive}} behaviour only around their nests, and are more timid while foraging. However, most species are extremely aggressive towards intruders; a few, such as M. tarsata, are timid, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> retreat into their nest instead of pursuing the intruder. If a nest is disturbed, a large force of workers rapidly swarms out of their nest to attack and kill the intruder. Some species, particularly those of the M. nigrocincta and M. pilosula species groups, are capable of jumping several inches when they are agitated after their nest has been disturbed; jumper ants propel their jumps by a sudden extension of their middle and hind legs. M. pyriformis is considered the most dangerous ant in the world by the Guinness World Records. M. inquilina is the only species of this genus that is considered vulnerable by the IUCN, although the conservation status needs updating.|$|E

25|$|Since R. revolutionalis queens mate singly, {{there is}} a high level of {{relatedness}} within the colony, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> are more likely to favor the sons produced by workers rather than sons produced by the queen because the workers are more closely related to each other's sons.
