40|$|The {{response}} of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is considered using a wave equation for the substrate and the Navier-Stokes equations for a finite liquid layer under a slip boundary condition. It is shown {{that when the}} slip length to shear wave penetration depth is small, the first order effect of slip is only present in the frequency response. Importantly, in this approximation the frequency response satisfies an additivity relation with a net response equal to a Kanazawa liquid term plus an additional Sauerbrey "rigid" liquid mass. For the slip length to result in an enhanced frequency decrease compared to a no-slip boundary condition, it is shown that the slip length must be negative so that the slip plane {{is located on the}} liquid side of the interface. It is argued that the physical application of such a negative slip length could be to the liquid phase {{response of}} <b>a</b> <b>QCM</b> with <b>a</b> completely wetted rough surface. Effectively, the model recovers the starting assumption of additivity used in the trapped mass model for the liquid phase response of <b>a</b> <b>QCM</b> having <b>a</b> rough surface. When applying the slip boundary condition to the rough surface problem, slip is not at a molecular level, but is a formal hydrodynamic boundary condition which relates the response of the QCM to that expected from <b>a</b> <b>QCM</b> with <b>a</b> smooth surface. Finally, possible interpretations of the results in terms of acoustic reflectivity are developed and the potential limitations of the additivity result should vapour trapping occur are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{quartz crystal}} {{microbalance}} (<b>QCM)</b> is <b>an</b> ultra-sensitive weighing device. It {{consists of a}} piezoelectric quartz crystal, often {{in the form of}} a disk, which is sandwiched between a pair of evaporated electrodes. When these are connected to an electronic oscillator, the crystal can be made to oscillate in a very stable manner at its resonant frequency, f, due to the piezoelectric effect. If a thin, rigid film is deposited evenly over one or both of the electrode surfaces in such a way that it does not slip on the surface, the resonant frequency decreases proportionally to the mass of the film. By measuring the resonant frequency, masses well below 1 ng/cm 2 can be gauged. Traditionally, the QCM has been used in gaseous or vacuum environments but has lately been employed as a mass sensor in liquids. However, in a liquid, several other factors besides the deposited mass may influence the resonant frequency, and the linear mass to frequency relationship might no longer hold. A large fraction of this thesis work has been devoted to developing techniques to simultaneously and reliably measure the resonant frequency and the Q factor (inversely proportional to the power dissipation) of <b>a</b> <b>QCM</b> operating in either air or liquid. The other part of the work has concerned applications of the QCM technique where the change in resonant frequency may not be linearly related to the change in deposited mass. These include the deposition of a mass that (i) is viscous (i. e., not rigid), (ii) is slipping on the surface, (iii) is not deposited evenly over the electrode(s), (iv) causes a change in the dielectric constant or conductivity of the medium contacting the QCM, and/or (v) changes the coupling between the crystal motion and the surrounding liquid. It is shown that in some of these cases, it is still possible to obtain a reliable measure of the deposited mass if the Q factor is measured simultaneously with the resonant frequency. The thesis is based on six papers. Papers I and II describe methods to simultaneously measure the Q factor and the resonant frequency of <b>a</b> <b>QCM.</b> Paper III treats how films that are not rigid and may slip on the QCM electrode(s) influence f and Q. Paper IV shows how liquid deposits that are not deposited evenly over the electrode surface affect f and Q. Paper V discusses how the electrical properties (dielectric constant and conductivity) of a liquid in contact with <b>a</b> <b>QCM</b> influence f and Q. Finally, Paper VI is an in situ study of protein adsorption onto a thiol modified gold surface using the QCM. The latter paper shows, among other things, how the knowledge from Papers I-V is used in a 'real' measurement situation. Generally, the results of this thesis significantly advance the understanding of how <b>a</b> <b>QCM</b> operates and can be utilized in liquid phase measurements...|$|R

40|$|Artificial {{insemination}} (AI) is {{a widely}} used part of the modern agricultural industry, {{with the number of}} animals inseminated globally being measured in the millions per anum. Crucial to the success of AI is that the sperm sample used is of a high Quality. Two factors which determine the quality of the sample are the number of sperm present and their motility. There are numerous methods used to analyse the quality of a sperm sample, but these are generally laboratory based, expensive and in need of a skilled operator to perform the analysis. It would, therefore be useful to have a simple and inexpensive system which could be used outside the laboratory, immediately prior to the insemination of the animal.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} a high-stability quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) to measure the mass of a gas absorbed on and in the metal electrode on the quartz oscillator, when the gas pressure is low and the gas can be considered as rigidly attached to the metal, so viscosity effects are negligible. This provides an absolute measure of the total mass of gas uptake as a function of time, which can be used to model the kinetic processes involved. The technique can measure diffusion parameters of gases in metals close to room temperature at gas pressures much below one atmosphere, as relevant to surface processes such as atomic layer deposition and model studies of heterogeneous catalysis, whereas traditional diffusion measurements require temperatures over 400 oC at gas pressures of at least a few Torr. A strong aspect of the method is the ability to combine the bulk measurement of absorbed mass by <b>a</b> <b>QCM</b> with <b>a</b> surface-sensitive technique such as Auger electron spectroscopy in the same vacuum chamber. The method is illustrated using atomic oxygen, formed under O 2 gas at 6 x 10 - 5 Torr {{in the presence of a}} hot tungsten filament, interacting with the gold electrode on <b>a</b> <b>QCM</b> crystal held at 52 to 120 oC. Some of the incident oxygen forms a surface oxide which eventually blocks more uptake, and the rest, about 80 %, indiffuses. Surprisingly, the rate of oxygen uptake initially increases with the amount of oxygen previously absorbed; therefore, the measured oxygen uptake with time is reproducible only if pre-adsorption of oxygen conditions the sample. Temperatures above 130 oC are necessary for measurable thermal desorption, but all the oxygen can be removed by CO scavenging at all temperatures of these experiments. Simple kinetic models are developed for fitting the experimental data to extract relevant parameters...|$|R

Alternative confirmation of results obtained by ellipsometry which indicated minimal protein attachment to superhydrophobic surfaces was facilitated by bacterial attachment studies. Bacterial interactions with implanted biomaterials represent {{the first step in}} the development of biofilm-associated, device-related infections [46]. Surface hydrophobicity plays an important role in these interactions as does the conditioning film of serum and tissue proteins such as Fg and Fn, which is rapidly deposited on implanted biomaterials [46]. Bacterial pathogens express surface proteins that promote binding to Fg, Fn and a range of other serum and extracellular matrix proteins [46]. Thus, bacterial attachment experiments were carried out using an S. aureus (SH 1000), which is known to bind specifically to Fg before and after protein adsorption experiments to identify any potential increase in bacterial attachment due to an adsorbed protein layer. It is hypothesised that SH coatings may both directly and indirectly (by limiting the deposition of serum and tissue proteins) reduce bacterial interactions with implanted materials.|$|R
30|$|Commercial QCM {{electrodes}} of gold {{surface area}} 0.2  cm 2 {{were used as}} the substrates. The whole preparation procedure was already described in details [14]. Briefly,para-benzene-sulfonyl chloride functionalized QCM gold surfaces were prepared by electrochemical processes using sulfanilic acid (C 6 H 7 O 3 NS, Sigma-Aldrich) as the starting precursor. The reaction was performed at room temperature and pressure. Sulfanilic acid, 4.3  and 1.72  mg of sodium nitrite (NaNO 2, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 5  ml of 1  M hydrochloric acid (HCl, Sigma-Aldrich). The mixture was introduced into the electrochemical cell constituted of <b>a</b> <b>QCM</b> gold substrate as work electrode, saturated calomel electrode as reference electrode and a platinum wire as counter electrode. Cyclic voltammetry experiment (Princeton applied research, VMP 2) was performed in the potential range of 0.3 to − 0.25  V at potential scan rate of 100  mV s− 1 up to five cycles. After electrochemical reaction, the substrates were immersed in 5.2  mg phosphorous pentachloride (PCl 5, Sigma-Aldrich)/ 5  ml dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2, Sigma-Aldrich) solution. Finally, the substrates were washed in CH 2 Cl 2 to remove unreacted PCl 5.|$|R
