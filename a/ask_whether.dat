By the above theorem, this {{is equivalent to the}} Feder–Vardi conjecture on CSP dichotomy, which states that for every constraint language Γ, CSP(Γ) is NP-complete or in P.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that Muslims were monsters {{to him and}} asked the court why they were not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated that German people should not mingle with foreigners and declared that he would vote for the far right National Democratic Party of Germany. The judge then requested a verbatim record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the judge to <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> he had ever visited a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|Leslie is {{approached}} by scouts looking for potential candidates for elected office, {{which has always}} been one of her dreams.

With the expected increased media attention on her personal life, the scouts <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> Leslie has any secret scandals in her life. She denies any such scandals exist, thus omitting her secret relationship with Ben, and the scouts promise to contact her about preparing an electoral run.|$|E

5|$|As the Griffin family {{attend the}} county fair, Stewie announces {{that he has}} bred a winning {{pedigree}} pig for the local Quahog Clam Day. Revealing to Brian that he got the pig from a parallel universe, he shows him a remote control that allows access to the various parallel universes. Each universe depicts Quahog {{in the same time}} and place but under different conditions. Deciding to test the device, they both visit a universe where Christianity never existed (despite the existence of the Sistine Chapel in that universe), leading an impressed Brian to <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> the remote can take them to other alternative realities. Stewie guides them both through several more parallel universes, about half of which have their own portrayals of the Griffin family. As time passes, Brian begins to lose his amazement for the device and eventually comes to realize that Stewie has no idea how to return home.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} {{hour and a half}} the frigates poured shot into one another at close range, until Cooke was struck by grape shot at 01:30 on 1 March, {{replaced}} by his first lieutenant Lucius Hardyman. For another hour the action continued, French fire gradually slackening until it stopped completely at 02:30, by which time only four French guns remained operational. Hardyman hailed to <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> Forte had surrendered but the French did not reply and he ordered another broadside. A second hail also brought no response but sailors were seen attempting to repair the rigging on Forte. Concerned that the French were attempting to escape, Hardyman concentrated his fire on the masts of Forte, bringing them crashing down one by one until at 03:00 Forte was completely dismasted. With all resistance ended, British merchant prisoners on board Forte emerged from below decks and hailed Sybille, requesting a boat be sent across so that British Lieutenant Nicholas Manger could formally take the surrender of the French ship.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of question wording and cognitive busyness on participant decisions to leave or stay in a hypothetical abusive relationship. Participants <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> they would leave were expected to make decisions closer to 2 ̆ 7 definitely leave 2 ̆ 7 than participants <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> they would stay, with the effect being more pronounced for cognitively busy participants. Participants read an abuse vignette and then half were instructed to memorize numbers to manipulate busyness. All participants imagined they were in the victim 2 ̆ 7 s position, tried to recall reasons from the vignette that were relevant to the decision, and indicated their decisions on a scale from 2 ̆ 7 definitely stay 2 ̆ 7 to 2 ̆ 7 definitely leave 2 ̆ 7. As predicted, male decisions were closer to 2 ̆ 7 definitely leave 2 ̆ 7 when <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> they would leave than when <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> they would stay. The opposite pattern, however, was found for female participants, with decisions being closest to 2 ̆ 7 definitely leave 2 ̆ 7 when <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> they would stay...|$|R

5|$|Culverhouse was {{described}} as late as 1982 as a rare owner who was popular with players, coaches, and fans. He was commended for allowing his staff to handle football operations without interference, and for having the patience to allow John McKay {{to follow through with}} his building plan despite the franchise's 0–26 start. This changed after events surrounding the 1982 players' strike. A report issued by the National Football League Players Association {{prior to the start of}} negotiations revealed that the Buccaneers had the fifth-highest gross income of all NFL teams, while their average salary was only the 21st-highest. This directly contradicted statements made by Culverhouse in 1980, in which he told players that they were on one of the three highest-paid teams. The NFLPA figures showed that the Buccaneers were actually the third lowest-paying team, based on total salaries as a percentage of gross income. Culverhouse was then accused of trying to divide the players during the strike, when some of the team's assistant coaches contacted players to <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> they would be willing to return to the team should training facilities be reopened.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the MCC was {{involved}} in controversy over the non-selection of the mixed-race cricketer Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa, which was then under apartheid. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira, himself South African-born, in the England team because of his colour. The MCC were aware that there was opposition to a tour taking place, and that D'Oliveira's place in the team would be an issue, but wanted the tour to go ahead. The Shadow Foreign Secretary and former MCC President Sir Alec Douglas-Home visited South Africa in January 1968 and met the South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, who privately did not want D'Oliveira to come to South Africa under any circumstances. Vorster suggested to Douglas-Home that the MCC should not explicitly <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> D'Oliveira's selection would be acceptable, {{but that it was}} likely no protest would be made. Douglas-Home passed this information to the MCC and advised them not to push for an answer. They had earlier written to the South African Cricket Association to establish whether they had a free hand in choosing a team, but their change of strategy meant that when the official reply arrived Allen refused to take receipt of it. In his biography of D'Oliveira, Peter Oborne writes that Allen and the MCC secretary Billy Griffith wished to hide any South African reply from the full MCC Committee to avoid raising awkward questions over Vorster's intentions.|$|E
