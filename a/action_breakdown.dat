Four issues, concerning both the theories and their accounts of everyday <b>action</b> <b>breakdown,</b> emerge: first, whether multiple control systems, each capable of controlling action in different situations, exist; second, whether different forms of damage at the neural level result in conceptually distinct disorders; third, whether semantic/conceptual knowledge of objects and actions can be dissociated from control mechanisms, and if so what computational principles govern sequential control; and fourth, whether disorders of everyday action should {{be attributed to a}} loss of semantic/conceptual knowledge, a malfunction of control, or some combination of the two...|$|E

This resulted in an inhibition of chondrocyte proteoglycan synthesis and breakdown of cartilage matrix proteoglycans as shown with 35 S-incorporation and autoradiography. These effects could not be inhibited by catalase or superoxide dismutase. A serine protease inhibitor and a specific elastase inhibitor prevented both proteoglycan degradation and chondrocyte damage, indicating that PMN-elastase is the causative agent. It was shown that elastase shed by PMN {{in close contact with}} the articular cartilage, can escape from complexing with alpha- 1 proteinase inhibitor. We would hypothesize that the elastase owing to its dual <b>action</b> (matrix <b>breakdown</b> and inhibition of chondrocyte metabolism) is a major contributor to enzymatic cartilage destruction in inflammatory disorders...|$|R

40|$|During {{collaborative}} {{data analysis}} participants are reliant on a shared common ground {{to be able}} to understand others' locations and <b>actions,</b> <b>breakdowns</b> in which require remedial action before other activities can continue. This thesis investigates the frequency and severity of common ground breakdowns that occur during collaborative navigation, when a wall-sized display user (master) directs a desktop user (slave) within a Collaborative Virtual Environment (CVE). A series of experiments were conducted to investigate this form of collaborative navigation and evaluate the developed solutions. These experiments required participants using a desktop display to view a wall-sized display user's navigation to targets within a 3 D landscape, before attempting to re-visit these targets themselves. Experiments 1 and 2 were conducted to establish the typical frequency and severity of common ground breakdowns when the desktop user is attempting to find singular and multiple targets. Participants exhibited non-trivial levels of common ground breakdown over different types of movement and input device used by the wall-sized display master. Although they frequently had sufficient common ground to reach the approximate area of a target, this was insufficient for them {{to be able to}} complete the task. The remainder of the research investigated two distinct classes of solution to these breakdown: additional views and path visualisations. For additional views, a large field of view (FOV) context view and local overview map were provided. Experiment 3 evaluated their effect and demonstrated that neither of which reduced the level of common ground breakdown exhibited by desktop users. Behavioural changes of participants using the context view still led to similar task failures. For path visualisation, two representations of paths between targets, string and heatmap were provided. Experiment 4 provides evidence that both representations significantly increased participant's success rate. Behavioural data showed that participants visited areas unrelated to their search less frequently and remained closer to the desired path. In conclusion, this research has four major contributions. First, a classification of the types, severity and frequency of common ground breakdowns that occur between desktop and wall-sized display users conducting master-slave navigation within a CVE. Second, evidence is provided that additional views are not beneficial in reducing the level of breakdown for the desktop users. Third, path visualisations are shown to be effective in reducing the level of breakdown experienced by the desktop users, and allowing more effective navigational behaviour. Finally, the successful application of heatmaps in aiding navigation when previous applications have been limited to analytical use...|$|R

From the outbreak of cascading failures to the system complete <b>breakdown,</b> <b>actions</b> can be taken to prevent failure propagation through the entire network. While most analysis efforts have been carried out before or after cascading failures, restoration during cascading failures has been rarely studied. In this paper, we present a modeling framework to investigate the effects of in-process restoration, which depends strongly on the timing and strength of the restoration actions. Furthermore, in the model we also consider additional disturbances to the system due to restoration actions themselves. We demonstrate that the effect of restoration is also influenced by the combination of system loading level and restoration disturbance. Our modeling framework will help to provide insights on practical restoration from cascading failures and guide improvements of reliability and resilience of actual network systems...|$|R

30|$|The {{process of}} {{lignocellulosic}} biomass bioconversion to ethanol involves three major steps, namely pretreatment, saccharification, and fermentation. Keeping {{in view of}} voluminous research reports on mild-alkali and dilute-acid pretreatments of lignocellulosic biomass residues and microbial fermentation processes [12 - 14], the detailed description on the two steps is not described in detail in this report and further researchers are suggested to refer recent reviews [15, 16]. Saccharification of the pretreated lignocellulosic biomass depends mainly on the hydrolytic efficiency of each individual cellulase enzyme component present in the multi-cellulase complex and their synergistic <b>action</b> towards the <b>breakdown</b> of insoluble celluloses and hemicelluloses into simple reducing sugars [6]. In continuation to our earlier published work on the production of cellulases from A. terreus D 34 and enzymatic hydrolysis on mild-alkali pretreated RS biomass [12, 13], here we report the detailed zymographic identification studies of multiple cellulase hemicellulase enzymes and microbial growth substrate optimization for low-cost production of cellulases using cheap lignocellulosic biomass residues. In addition, enzymatic saccharification studies on mild-alkali and dilute-acid pretreated RS- and BG-biomass residues with different cellulase cocktails are also reported.|$|R
40|$|Photoinitiators play a {{key role}} in UV-curable systems by {{generating}} the reactive species, free radicals, ions or molecule which initiate the polymerisation of the multifunctional monomers and oligomers. This research involves the study of the hydrolytic and photolytic stabilities of two important new photoinitiator bis (2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoyl) phenylphosphine oxide (BAPO) and (2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoyl) diphenyl-phosphine oxide (TPO). BAPO is a new member in the group of well-known α-cleavable photoinitiators among which monoacylphosphine oxide (MAPO) is most recognised. These α–cleavable photoinitiators are characterised by low volatility and high solubility in acrylate monomers and they are very widely applied as curing agents for white and pigmented coatings including furniture coatings. Novel analytical methods were developed in order to characterise these compounds and to understand their modes of <b>action</b> and <b>breakdown.</b> The stability of BAPO in different solvents, such as acetonitrile and a cyanoacrylate ester, was studied and the effect of storage of BAPO in light and dark conditions was evaluated. The effects of stabilisers (ferrocene, cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) and hydroquinone (HQ)), acids (methyl sulphonic acid (MSA) and boron trifluoride dihydrate (BF 3 ∙ 2 H 2 O)) and water present in the solvent were also investigated. These studies were monitored over time using LC-UV and CE-UV methods. Mass spectrometry was employed for the first time to investigate the pathways and photodegradation products for both of the photoinitiators BAPO and TPO. NMR spectroscopy and computational studies were used as complementary experimental and theoretical techniques respectively for the elucidation of the photochemistry of these products. A formulation study using the photoinitiator and ethyl cyanoacrylate monomer to ascertain the polymerisation products, and possible cure mechanism with the aid of mass spectrometry was also carried out. ...|$|R
40|$|Beta-Carotene (BC) {{and other}} {{carotenoids}} are mainly considered {{as belonging to}} the group of micronutrients. As they are contained in fruit and vegetables and thus part of human diet, a regular low-dose intake from natural sources is normally assured. In the last decade highdose supplementation with synthetic carotenoids has been used successfully in the treatment of diseases believed to be associated with oxidative stress. However, in a few clinical studies harmful effects have been observed as well, e. g., a higher incidence of lung cancer after BC was given in high doses to smokers. Our studies aim at shedding light on the causal mechanisms of the known side effects that we have investigated. Possibilities of preventing them are discussed. Obviously, on certain conditions of high-dose carotenoid supplementation, both the antioxidant and prooxidant reactions may arise. Carotenoid breakdown products (CBP) including very reactive aldehydes and epoxides are formed during oxidative attack in the course of antioxidative <b>action.</b> Carotenoid <b>breakdown</b> products inhibit state 3 respiration of isolated rat liver mitochondria at concentrations between 0. 5 and 20 AM. In vivo stimulated neutrophils might represent an important source for the generation of CBP, and the lung might be a critical organ in CBP formation. The inhibition of mitochondrial state 3 respiration by CBP is accompanied by a reduced content of protein sulfhydryl groups, decreasing glutathione levels and redox state, and also elevated accumulation of malondialdehyde. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential favour functional deterioration of the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). The findings reflect a basic mechanism of the side effects of BC supplementation in circumstances of severe oxidative stress induced by CBP representing a class of lipid oxidation products. We are striving for safe conditions of carotenoid supplementation in order to protect patients in need of this kind of medical treatment from possible side effects, such as unwanted prooxidative reactions...|$|R

After 3 days the protein content had decreased to 46 % of the initial value.

This effect was observed only when leaves were treated with kinetin within the first 24 hours after detachment. The action of kinetin on both protein synthesis and degradation was quantitatively measured. Synthesis was estimated by the incorporation of l-[3 H]leucine into proteins. It was higher in kinetin treated than in non treated leaves. It contributed to about 14 micrograms of protein retention per leaf in 3 days. Measurement of protein degradation, evaluated by the decay of radioactivity in leaf proteins previously labeled with l-[3 H] leucine or as the difference between rates of protein synthesis and protein content, showed that kinetin decreased protein breakdown rates. It accounted for about 186 micrograms of protein retention per leaf in 3 days.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the leftist {{propaganda}} in the Hong Kong 1967 riots. It shows how the local leftists launched a propaganda campaign to persuade citizens to join the anti-government confrontation. After critically examining leftist propaganda materials, the thesis analyzes different arguments of the propagandists. The leftists’ propaganda failed to persuade the masses to follow them. To explain their failure, the thesis compares the aims of leftist propaganda before and during 1967. Given the different aims, the thesis argues that the inconsistency of the propaganda caused the leftists to lose support. When the leftists used violent actions to “struggle” against the colonial government, their radical actions were described by citizens as “terrorist attacks” and the leftists became “troublemakers”. Thus, the thesis also argues that the leftists’ threat to law and order drove Hong Kong citizens {{to stay out of}} the riots. After the anti-government movement became radical, the Hong Kong government took firm actions against the local communists. The police force raided leftist trade unions and arrested leftist leaders. These <b>actions</b> caused the <b>breakdown</b> of the leftist propaganda mechanism. The thesis analyzes the decision-making processes of the Hong Kong government, and argues that it was the leftists’ radical actions that caused the government’s firm actions, and thus the failure of the leftist propaganda, and the anti-government campaign were self-inflicted. published_or_final_versionHistoryMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|In {{the fresh}} state, self-compacting {{concrete}} (SCC) shows large differences compared to ordinary vibrated concrete. SCC is {{considered as a}} much more fluid material. On the other hand, the same equipment and the same standard rules as for ordinary concrete are applied during pumping. Does the different fluid behaviour influence the pumping procedure and are some new precautions needed ? By means of full-scale testing, {{the influence of the}} fresh (rheological) properties on the pressure required during pumping of SCC were investigated. The results show, in case of SCC, a very large influence of the viscosity on the concrete on the pumping pressures, and as SCC has in general a higher viscosity than ordinary concrete, it requires higher pressures to be pumped. The velocity profile of SCC flowing in pipes consists of a small plug with constant velocity in the centre in the centre of the pipe, a large velocity gradient near the pipe wall and a smaller velocity gradient in between. As a result, SCC, in contrast to ordinary concrete, does not flow at uniform velocity in a pipe. As a result, the flow in bends causes an additional pressure loss, but due to the very large scatter in the results, no conclusions can be drawn. The pumping process influences the fresh properties of the SCC due to two different <b>actions</b> : structural <b>breakdown,</b> which means that the concrete becomes more fluid due to high speed flowing, and an increase in air content. SCC with a high initial slump flow shows decreased segregation resistance after pumping, while for SCC with a low initial slump flow, the slump flow decreases even more. Both effect appear to have an increase importance with increasing pumping velocities. As a result, it is advised to pump SCC at rather low velocities...|$|R
40|$|Adults with {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) are at high risk of {{developing}} medically serious pressure ulcers due to decreased mobility and reductions in skin sensitivity (Correa et al., 2006; Garber, Rintala, Hart, 2 ̆ 6 Furhrer, 2000; Maklebust, 2005). Many ulcers exacerbate to require surgical repair resulting in extensive, occupationally debilitating hospitalization. Beyond their medical consequences, pressure ulcers impact functional ability to pursue occupations that contribute to a person’s sense of independence, control, productivity, and quality of life (Tate 2 ̆ 6 Forchheimer, 2002). Currently there is little occupational science literature conceptualizing how occupational opportunities and obstacles affect responses to low grade ulcers. This qualitative study is a secondary analysis (Clark et al., 2006) that aims to offer deeper insight into the ulcer response process and draws attention to that critical window of time following the onset of early skin <b>breakdown.</b> <b>Action</b> taken during this crucial period often determines ulcer progression. This presentation explores how occupational lifestyle issues affected pressure ulcer risk in adults with SCI who responded to an early ulcer that progressed to a medically serious level. Through analysis of individualized profiles developed in the parent study from participant observation field notes and in-depth interviews, emergent occupational patterns were identified. A typological framework of responses was then created to elucidate the complex interplay between occupational decision-making and the associated health consequences. Results revealed the most common emergent response to be Distraction, the decision to engage in everyday occupation or a pressing life event versus attending to healing a newly discovered ulcer. This confirms that individual daily life occupations and contexts are not only inextricably intertwined but oftentimes at odds with health-related actions. Discussion topics stimulated by these findings include: 1) how occupational science might conceptualize negotiating engagement in meaningful occupation versus a prescribed risk-reducing regime that challenges full participation in daily life; 2) how occupation has the potential to affect participants‚ responses to potentially debilitating health risks; and 3) the importance of a preventive occupation-based approach to structured follow-up interventions within one’s everyday life setting...|$|R
40|$|The <b>action</b> {{of nerve}} <b>breakdown</b> {{products}} on innervated fibres of soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles was investigated {{with the following}} procedures: partial denervation, sensory or sympathetic denervation, section of a previously transplanted foreign nerve. Each procedure was performed either in isolation or combined with chronic muscle inactivity obtained by blocking impulse conduction along the sciatic nerve. Silastic cuffs containing tetrodotoxin (TTX) and sodium chloride were utilized for the block. Partial denervation induced extrajunctional sensitivity to acetylcholine (ACh) and resistance to tetrodotoxin {{not only in the}} denervated but also in the innervated fibres. The effects in the innervated fibres were equal in magnitude to those in the denervated fibres, provided they were paralysed. The onset of the membrane changes was synchronous in the two classes of fibres and their amount correlated with the extent of partial denervation. If the innervated fibres were normally active, the membrane changes were still detectable, but considerably smaller than in the denervated fibres. Sensory denervation (removal of dorsal root ganglia L 4 and L 5) was followed by the development of moderate ACh supersensitivity and TTX resistance in chronically paralysed muscles. Furthermore, section of radicular nerves (total denervation, i. e. efferent plus afferent) induced larger membrane changes than those observed following section of ventral roots alone (efferent denervation). Sympathetic denervation was ineffective even when associated with chronic muscle paralysis. Section of a previously transplanted mixed nerve (superficial fibular) was ineffective if the soleus muscle was normally active, while it induced marked extrajunctional ACh sensitivity and TTX resistance when combined with chronic paralysis of the muscle. Section of a transplanted sensory nerve (sural) also induced extrajunctional membrane changes in paralysed soleus muscles, but their magnitude was much smaller than after section of mixed nerves. We conclude that products of nerve destruction, especially those of motor axons, induce membrane changes of striking magnitude when potentiated by muscle inactivity. Such an action may also explain the greater efficacy of denervation vs. pure inactivity, at least at early times after their onset...|$|R
