25|$|The rollout of {{the first}} ship was delayed, mainly by {{certification}} problems (certification required the Civil Aviation Authority to write a set of <b>airworthiness</b> <b>requirements</b> for airships, something that took six months) but also by factors including a change of envelope supplier and revision of the engine and propeller design. The AD500, as it was by then known, first flew from Cardington on 3 February 1979.|$|E
25|$|On 21 May 1979, {{the group}} donated the {{aircraft}} to the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) Aviation Foundation, {{under the auspices}} of the B-17 Historical Society. Aluminum Overcast was put on display until 1983, before it began a 10-year restoration. The extensive work involved the rebuilding of all the interior stations, including the radio compartment, waist gunners' stations, tail turret and navigator's station, and replacing the cabin flooring, as well as locating original equipment such as the Norden bombsight. Where authentic components were not available, realistic replicas, such as the new-manufacture top turret, were substituted. While the aircraft is about 95 percent authentic, recreating the configuration in 1945 when it rolled off the assembly line, concessions to technological improvements such as a modern radio and avionics suite are incorporated to meet the current <b>airworthiness</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{prototype}} of the licensed version, known as the B.K. Swallow, first flew at Hanworth in November 1933. [...] It was an all-wooden cantilever monoplane, with tandem cockpits accommodating two persons, and was powered by a 75hp (56kW) Salmson 9 or 85hp (63kW) Pobjoy Cataract radial engine. [...] It differed from the German original with its more powerful engines and local strengthening to meet British <b>airworthiness</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E

25|$|The <b>airworthiness</b> design <b>requirements</b> {{applicable}} to the Vickers Viscount and other safe-life transport category aeroplanes did not require retirement lives to be determined taking account of an unpredictable gross defect of the kind inflicted on the wing spar of VH-RMQ by insertion of the flared bush.

40|$|Based on {{years of}} {{airworthiness}} regulations research, {{combined with the}} experience of airworthiness certification of civil aviation products, the <b>airworthiness</b> <b>requirement</b> to materials for civil aviation products was analyzed. The key <b>airworthiness</b> <b>requirement</b> for materials is that materials should conform to some material specification to ensure their having the strength and other properties adopted in the design data. The shortcomings of domestic airworthiness management methods for civil aviation materials was discussed and three recommendations for improvement were proposed:(1) conduct individual airworthiness management for civil aviation materials according to CCAR 21. 351 through 371 and CCAR 37; (2) develop and promote statistical-based material specification developing methods, to establish material specifications which could ensure material having the strength and other properties adopted in the design data; (3) establish a cooperation mechanism for developing material design value data base for civil aviation materials to reduce the cost of airworthiness certification activities. At the end of this paper, statistical methods used for establishing material specifications were discussed...|$|R

2500|$|The Great Lakes {{continued}} to be popular well after production ended and many aircraft adopted more powerful engines, particularly the Jacobs radial engines. [...] Eventually, in the 1960s, the rights for the Sport Trainer were acquired by Harvey Swack, who offered plans of the aircraft for sale to homebuilders. [...] In 1972, Swack sold the rights on to Doug Champlin, who set up a reconstituted Great Lakes Aircraft Company to produce a revised version meeting the current <b>airworthiness</b> <b>requirements,</b> powered by modern Lycoming engines and revised materials of construction (including the use of Douglas fir instead of spruce). [...] The first of the new production aircraft, the Model 2T-1A-1, powered by a 140hp engine was certified in May 1973, with production starting in October that year. [...] A more powerful version, the 2T-1A-2 followed in July 1974. In 1978 production was divided between Witchita Kansas and Enid, Oklahoma with the intent on relocation to Florida.|$|E
