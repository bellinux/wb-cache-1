50|$|Technetium (99mTc) <b>arcitumomab</b> {{is a drug}} {{used for}} the {{diagnostic}} imaging of colorectal cancers, marketed by Immunomedics. It consists of the Fab' fragment of a monoclonal antibody (<b>arcitumomab,</b> trade name CEA-Scan) and a radionuclide, technetium-99m.|$|E
50|$|Technetium (99mTc) <b>arcitumomab</b> is an immunoconjugate. <b>Arcitumomab</b> is a Fab' {{fragment}} of IMMU-4, a murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody {{extracted from the}} ascites of mice. The enzyme pepsin cleaves the F(ab')2 {{fragment of}}f the antibody. From this, the Fab' fragment is prepared by mild reduction.|$|E
50|$|Regions of high CEA {{levels in}} the body can be {{detected}} with the monoclonal antibody <b>arcitumomab.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before application, <b>arcitumomab</b> is reconstituted with a {{solution}} of the radioactive agent sodium pertechnetate (99mTc) from a technetium generator.|$|E
50|$|Radioactivity {{can lead}} to {{radiation}} poisoning. Since the dose of an <b>arcitumomab</b> application is about 10 mSv, such an overdose is unlikely.|$|E
50|$|Technetium (99mTc) <b>arcitumomab</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{for patients}} with known allergies or hypersensitivity to mouse proteins, as well as during pregnancy. Women should pause breast feeding for 24 hours after application of the drug.|$|E
50|$|<b>Arcitumomab</b> recognizes {{carcinoembryonic antigen}} (CEA), an antigen over-expressed in 95% of {{colorectal}} cancers. Consequently, the antibody accumulates in such tumours {{together with the}} radioisotope, which emits photons. Via single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), high-resolution images showing localisation, remission or progression, and metastases of the tumour can be obtained.|$|E
50|$|Only {{mild and}} {{transient}} side effects have been observed, mostly immunological reactions like eosinophilia, itching and fever. Some patients develop human anti-mouse antibodies, {{so there is}} the theoretical possibility of anaphylactic reactions. High doses of IMMU-4 (up to 20-fold diagnostic <b>arcitumomab</b> dose) have not led to any serious events. One patient {{has been reported to}} develop a grand mal after application.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} role of <b>arcitumomab</b> (CEA-Scan; Immunomedics, Morris Plains, NJ), an anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) Fab' labeled with technetium- 99 m, in the presurgical evaluation of patients with recurrent or metastatic colorectal carcinoma. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Surgical resection is the only method known to cure recurrent or metastatic colorectal carcinoma. The location and extent of disease must be determined before surgery. The role of antibody imaging, a new cancer detection modality, in preoperative evaluation for resection of locally recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer has not been established, either alone or in combination with standard diagnostic modalities. METHODS: In a blinded analysis of 209 patients with known or suspected colorectal cancer, the accuracy of <b>arcitumomab,</b> alone and combined with computed tomography (CT), was compared to that of CT for predicting abdominopelvic tumor resectability by correlating the results with surgical and histopathologic findings. RESULTS: <b>Arcitumomab</b> alone or combined with CT was found to be significantly more accurate for predicting surgical outcome than CT alone. When the results of CT and <b>arcitumomab</b> were concordant for abdominopelvic resectability, nonresectability, or absence of disease, the prediction was accurate in 67 %, 100 %, and 64 %, respectively. Thus, the concordance for nonresectability (100 % correct) may obviate the need for other diagnostic modalities or exploratory surgery. When the two tests were discordant, <b>arcitumomab</b> was correct substantially more often than CT. Because the liver is the most common site of distant metastasis in colorectal cancer, a subset of patients with hepatic disease was also analyzed; findings were similar to the overall resectability results. The product's safety profile was excellent: the incidence of induction of an immune response against <b>arcitumomab</b> was < 1 % and that of potentially adverse events was 1. 2 %. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of <b>arcitumomab</b> for assessing resectability status is greater than that of CT, both in all patients undergoing evaluation for curative abdominopelvic resection of colorectal cancer and in the subset of patients with suspected or proven liver metastases. The additional use of <b>arcitumomab</b> with CT potentially doubles the number of patients who could be saved the cost, morbidity, and mortality of unnecessary abdominopelvic surgery and increases those who are potentially resectable for cure by 40 %...|$|E
40|$|ObjetivesThe {{aim of this}} {{analysis}} was to evaluate {{whether or not the}} added cost of immunoscintigraphy with CEA-Scan (<b>arcitumomab)</b> to routine anatomic imaging, can reduce the overall cost of patient management in patients with colorectal cancer. METHODS: Two hundred ten (210) colorectal cancer patients underwent preoperative CT and immunoscintigraphy. The ability of CT alone and combined with immunoscintigraphy to preoperatively assess the resectability status of each patient was evaluated. Costs included were: total cost of administering and interpreting both imaging studies, total surgical costs, and the costs of false positives and false negatives (with respect to determination of resectability). An outcomes table was constructed to incorporate economic possibilities for each patient sub-group. ResultsImmunoscintigraphy with <b>arcitumomab</b> reduced the overall cost of patient management by approximately $ 5, 000 per patient, primarily due to those patients whom CT incorrectly indicated as resectable. ConclusionThis analysis indicates that the addition of immunoscintigraphy to the preoperative workup of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer decreases the overall cost significantly...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} if imaging with <b>arcitumomab</b> (immunoscintigraphy) {{is sensitive to}} technical and interpretative techniques that must be mastered {{in order to obtain}} reliable results. We studied the impact of training to reduce the learning curve. Methods: 1) Evaluate the performance of an experienced Nuclear Medicine Physicians (Team A) un-blinded with their initial series of patients, compared to the conclusions of Experts (Team B) blinded from any clinical information; 2) Training of Team A is by the expert team on image acquisition, processing and interpretation techniques as well as using all clinical information and anatomic studies for comparison; 3) Assess the performance of the Team A on a second series of patients. 4) Questionnaires were sent to 65 consecutive physicians trained by experts to {{determine if}} the learned techniques improved interpretation of immunoscintigrams. Results: Twenty three (23) patients with CRC were included, 13 pre and 10 for the post teaching phase with a total of 30 clinically confirmed lesions (pathologically proven or demonstrated on follow-up). The clinically confirmed lesions include: 8 primary, 12 pelvic recurrences and 10 metastatic sites. On the pre-teaching series, Team A correctly identified only 6 / 19 lesions (32 %). On the post teaching series, Team A found 8 / 11 lesions (73 %) including 4 / 5 pelvic recurrence (80 %), all 3 primary lesions, and 1 / 3 metastasis which compares favorably to published results. To determine the effect of blinded reading of immunoscintigrams, Team B reviews the first 13 studies without any clinical information or CT for comparison. Team B found 10 / 19 lesions (53 %) with 4 false positive. Questionnaires were mailed to 65 trained physicians (54 returned), 67 % of responders found that training improved their results, 22 % experienced mixed results and 11 % did not notice any improvement. Conclusion: The lower than expected sensitivity by the blinded Expert Team confirms that the overall accuracy suffers without clinical information. Training and confidence improve the interpretation of immunoscintigraphy...|$|E
