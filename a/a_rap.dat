5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the Chick-fil-A Bowl, the number of controversies {{surrounding}} Tennessee head coach Lane Kiffin continued to grow. Throughout the regular season, he was linked to violations of NCAA rules and actions that appeared to fall outside the norm for SEC coaches.

40|$|AbstractRap 1 <b>A</b> and <b>Rap</b> 1 B {{are small}} GTPases of the Ras {{superfamily}} whose activation {{can be measured}} using a probe that interacts specifically with the GTP-bound forms of <b>Rap</b> 1 <b>A</b> and <b>Rap</b> 1 B. Using this procedure we demonstrate that the cyclic AMP-elevating agent forskolin activates both <b>Rap</b> 1 <b>A</b> and <b>Rap</b> 1 B in Rat 1 cells. Whilst the protein kinase A inhibitor H 89 ablated the ability of forskolin to cause cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation in Rat 1 cells, it {{did not affect the}} ability of forskolin to activate either <b>Rap</b> 1 <b>A</b> and <b>Rap</b> 1 B. Forskolin differentially activated <b>Rap</b> 1 <b>A</b> and <b>Rap</b> 1 B isoforms in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The cAMP-specific type 4 family phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram potentiated the rate of activation of both <b>Rap</b> 1 <b>A</b> and <b>Rap</b> 1 B by forskolin challenge of Rat 1 cells. Challenge of Rat 1 cells with rolipram alone was able to elicit the phosphorylation of CREB but not activation of either <b>Rap</b> 1 <b>A</b> or <b>Rap</b> 1 B...|$|R
