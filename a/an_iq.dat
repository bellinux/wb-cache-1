5|$|A major {{point of}} {{consensus}} among all scholars of intellectual giftedness {{is that there}} is no generally agreed definition of giftedness. Although there is no scholarly agreement about identifying gifted learners, there is a de facto reliance on IQ scores for identifying participants in school gifted education programs. In practice, many school districts in the United States use <b>an</b> <b>IQ</b> score of 130, including about the upper 2 or 3 percent of the national population, as a cut-off score for inclusion in school gifted programs.|$|E
5|$|In his {{cross-examination}} {{of the two}} doctors, Duchesne {{cited the}} psychological reports filed on Lamb at Penetanguishene in 1966, which had determined Lamb to have <b>an</b> <b>IQ</b> of 125, far above most of his 18-year-old peers. The prosecutor proposed {{that it was not}} beyond Lamb, with his psychopathic personality and high level of intelligence, to invent a story of amnesia and confusion to avoid responsibility for satisfying his dangerous impulses by consciously killing people. Both Yaworsky and Dolan said that although this was possible, they were each sticking to their original conclusions made in the days following the incident.|$|E

5|$|Shepard {{graduated}} from the Pinkerton Academy in 1940. Because World War II was already raging in Europe, his father wanted him to join the Army. Shepard chose the Navy instead. He easily passed the entrance exam to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1940, but at sixteen {{was too young to}} enter that year. The Navy sent him to the Admiral Farragut Academy, a prep school for the Naval Academy, from which he graduated with the class of 1941. Tests administered at Farragut indicated <b>an</b> <b>IQ</b> of 145, but his grades were mediocre.|$|E
5|$|The Differential Ability Scales Second Edition (DAS–II) was {{developed}} by Colin D. Elliott and published in 2007 by Psychological Corporation. The DAS-II is a test battery given individually to children, normed for children from ages two years and six months through seventeen years and eleven months. It was normed on 3,480 noninstitutionalized, English-speaking children in that age range. The DAS-II yields a General Conceptual Ability (GCA) score scaled like <b>an</b> <b>IQ</b> score with the median standard score set at 100 and 15 standard score points for each standard deviation up or down from the median. The lowest possible GCA score on DAS–II is 44, and the highest is 175.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} the episode {{developed}} from writer Jon Vitti {{coming up with}} a long list of bad things Bart would do for attention imagining the potential consequences. The only idea that developed into an interesting episode concept was Bart cheating on <b>an</b> <b>IQ</b> test. This idea was based on an incident from Vitti's childhood when a number of his classmates did not take an intelligence test seriously and suffered poor academic treatment because of it. Because Bart was already obviously unintelligent, Vitti reversed the problem for his episode. Vitti used all his memories of elementary school behavior to produce a draft script of 71 pages, substantially above the required length of about 45 pages.|$|E
40|$|Background Obesity is {{a global}} health problem. This {{condition}} may cause negative impacts on children's cognitive function. Early detection of obesity may lessen these impacts. Objective To determine the relationship between obesity status and cognitive intelligence in children. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted for two months 0 une to July 2008) on 7 'h grade students at three Junior High Schools in the Wenang subdistrict of Manado City, Indonesia. We included children aged 12 - 13 years, registered in 2007 - 2008, who gave parental consent, and who suffered from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and hypertension. We excluded children who were sick {{at the time of}} the study, suffered from epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), congenital heart disease, or malnutrition. Data were analyzed using Somers' D Test. Results There were 52 boys out of 100 subjects studied. Fifty eight students (58 %) had a normal BMI, and 42 were obese (36 with mild obesity, and 6 with moderate obesity). Out of the 42 obese students, 1 o/o had <b>a</b> defective <b>IQ,</b> 1 o/o had <b>a</b> below average <b>IQ,</b> 22 % had <b>an</b> average <b>IQ,</b> 7 % had <b>an</b> above average <b>IQ</b> and 11 o/o had <b>a</b> superior <b>IQ.</b> From 58 subjects with a normal BMI, none had <b>a</b> below average <b>IQ,</b> 20 % had <b>an</b> average <b>IQ,</b> 18 % had an above average, and 20 % had <b>a</b> superior <b>IQ.</b> The mean IQ scores for obese and non-obese subjects were 108. 7 and 114. 1 respectively. Conclusion Obesity has relationship with cognitive intelligence in junior high school students...|$|R

5|$|The {{effect of}} lead on children's {{cognitive}} abilities {{takes place at}} very low levels. There is apparently no lower threshold to the dose-response relationship (unlike other heavy metals such as mercury). Reduced academic performance {{has been associated with}} lead exposure even at blood lead levels lower than 5μg/dL. Blood lead levels below 10μg/dL have been reported to be associated with lower IQ and behavior problems such as aggression, in proportion with blood lead levels. Between the blood lead levels of 5 and 35μg/dL, <b>an</b> <b>IQ</b> decrease of 2–4 points for each μg/dL increase is reported in children. However, studies that show associations between low-level lead exposure and health effects in children may be affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level lead exposure.|$|E
5|$|IQ tests {{generally}} are reliable enough {{that most people}} ages ten and older have similar IQ scores throughout life. Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different times or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children in the famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with <b>an</b> <b>IQ</b> above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study. There were 643 children in the main study group. When the students who could be contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents of those children thought that the children were still as bright as ever, or even brighter.|$|E
5|$|Abra uses various extrasensory powers, {{even when}} sleeping. With {{the ability to}} read minds, they can sense danger, teleporting when it does and can do so quickly enough to create visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This {{behavior}} ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. These waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it evolves into Alakazam, it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become too heavy for its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. Able to remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has <b>an</b> <b>IQ</b> that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's mental abilities become even more pronounced due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam can engage in precognition, while all three Pokémon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected.|$|E

25|$|According to the American Enterprise Institute, {{research}} has shown that income and intelligence are related. In a 1998 study, Charles Murray compared the earnings of 733 full sibling pairs with differing intelligence quotients (IQs). He referred to the sample as utopian in that the sampled pairs were raised in families with virtually no illegitimacy, divorce or poverty. The average earnings of sampled individuals with <b>an</b> <b>IQ</b> of under 75 was $11,000, compared to $16,000 for those with <b>an</b> <b>IQ</b> between 75 and 90, $23,000 for those with <b>an</b> <b>IQ</b> between 90 and 110, $27,000 for those with <b>an</b> <b>IQ</b> between 110 and 125, and $38,000 for those with <b>an</b> <b>IQ</b> above 125. Murray's work on IQ has been criticized by Stephen Jay Gould, Loïc Wacquant and others, including the Southern Poverty Law Center.|$|E
25|$|Threshold Theory (TT).
