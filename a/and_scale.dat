5|$|After his death, Gaudí's works {{suffered}} {{a period of}} neglect and were largely unpopular among international critics, who regarded them as baroque and excessively imaginative. In his homeland he was equally disdained by Noucentisme, the new movement which took the place of Modernisme.

30|$|According to the {{construction}} of shift-invariance in the DPT, the translation should affect the synchronization of rotation <b>and</b> <b>scaling.</b> To uncouple the translation from rotation <b>and</b> <b>scaling,</b> we adopt the Fourier magnitude of the input signal as the DPT's input, which in turn achieves the real translation invariance. Under such a setting, we derive the synchronization mechanism for rotation <b>and</b> <b>scaling</b> as follows.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{based on}} the derived RST {{synchronization}} mechanism, we develop a new robust image watermarking that is resilient to RST. According to the aforementioned essence of DPT's shift-invariance, the translation of the input signal should affect the synchronization of rotation <b>and</b> <b>scaling.</b> To uncouple the translation from rotation <b>and</b> <b>scaling,</b> we take the Fourier magnitude of the cover image as the input to the DPT. This achieves true translation invariance. Rotation <b>and</b> <b>scaling</b> attacks are counteracted by first deploying the rotation <b>and</b> <b>scaling</b> synchronization mechanism to estimate their parameters. The estimated parameters are then used to correct the rotation <b>and</b> <b>scaling</b> that has been performed. In blind watermarking, the original signal cannot {{be used by the}} receiver, so we resort to the template to estimate the parameters of rotation <b>and</b> <b>scaling</b> attacks. Specifically, we insert the template and watermark at level 1 and levels 2 to 3, respectively, of the DPT pyramid in the embedding process. During the detection process, we exploit the rotation <b>and</b> <b>scaling</b> synchronization mechanism to identify the rotation angle <b>and</b> <b>scaling</b> factor, <b>and</b> further use these estimated parameters to correct the rotation <b>and</b> <b>scaling</b> distortions <b>and</b> recover the watermark from the geometrically corrected signal. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is highly robust against geometrical attacks such as RST and exhibits favorable performance against common signal processing, including JPEG compression, median filtering, Gaussian noise, and low-pass filtering. In addition, we observe comparable or higher robustness with respect to other algorithms in the simulation.|$|R

30|$|Because {{translation}} invariance {{has been}} achieved by taking the Fourier magnitude of the cover image as the DPT input, we merely use the inserted template to estimate the rotation angle <b>and</b> <b>scaling</b> factor.

Based on the synchronization mechanisms for rotation <b>and</b> <b>scaling</b> in Section  4.2, we develop the efficient template-matching algorithm as follows.|$|R

30|$|In this section, {{we present}} the {{proposed}} robust image watermarking algorithm, which is RST-resilient. The translation invariance {{is achieved by}} taking the Fourier magnitude of the cover image I(x, y) as the DPT input, and the rotation <b>and</b> <b>scaling</b> are counteracted using the inserted template and the rotation <b>and</b> <b>scaling</b> synchronization. The details are given below, where only K[*]=[*] 2 steerable basis filters are adopted to reduce the computational complexity of the rotation <b>and</b> <b>scaling</b> synchronization.|$|R

5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The {{first step is to}} merge <b>and</b> <b>scale</b> these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so that they have a consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E

5|$|Although it was series co-creator and {{producer}} Gerry Anderson's original plan to film with actual alligators, AP Films instead acquired {{a group of}} juvenile crocodiles from a private zoo in northern England; these would double as re-sized alligators on scale model sets and water tanks. With {{the exception of a}} five-foot (1.5m) specimen, which was too aggressive to be removed from its box, the animals were three feet (0.91m) long. The crew kept the on-set water tanks heated to a suitably warm temperature and used electric shocks to induce movement from the reptiles. They were unpredictable and very difficult to control and film, either bathing {{in the heat of the}} studio lights or disappearing into the tanks and remaining submerged for hours. To make the crocodiles more visible to the cameras, the crew fixed them to guiding rods and co-ordinated their movements. The heavy presence of the animals in both puppet <b>and</b> <b>scale</b> model shots resulted in a closer-than-normal degree of collaboration between the puppet and effects crews.|$|E
5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} end of the nineteenth century.

5|$|As {{with every}} game prior to Final Fantasy VII, Square had {{continued}} to use the passion-based game development approach present with their early projects, but now had the resources and ambition to create the game they wanted. This was because they had extensive capital from their earlier commercial successes, which meant they could focus on quality <b>and</b> <b>scale</b> rather than obsessing over their budget. Final Fantasy VII eventually became ranked {{as one of the}} most expensive video game projects at the time, coming in at an estimated $40 million USD, which adjusted for inflation came to $61 million in 2017. Development of the final version lasted just over a year, and included a staff of between 100 and 150 people. As video game development teams were usually only 20 people, the game had what was described as the largest development team of any game up to that point. The development team was split between both Square's Japanese offices and its new American office in Los Angeles, with the American team primarily responsible for city backgrounds.|$|E
