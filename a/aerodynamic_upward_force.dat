In gliding flight, no {{propulsion}} is used; the energy to counteract the energy loss due to aerodynamic drag is either taken from the potential energy of the bird, resulting in a descending flight, or is replaced by rising air currents ("thermals"), referred to as soaring flight.|$|R
5000|$|Cyclorotors {{produce thrust}} by {{combined}} action of a rotation of a fixed {{point of the}} blades around a centre and the oscillation of the blades that changes over time their angle-of-attack. The joint action of the advancement produced by the orbital motion and pitch angle variation generates a higher thrust even at low speed with respect of any other propeller. In hover, the blades are actuated to a positive pitch (outward {{from the center of}} the rotor) on the upper half of their revolution and a negative pitch (inward towards the axis of rotation) over the lower half inducing a net <b>upward</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>force</b> and opposite fluid downwash. By varying the phase of this pitch motion the force can be shifted sidewise or downward. Before blade stall, increasing the amplitude of the pitching kinematics will magnify thrust.|$|R
25|$|In the {{examples}} used the frequency used is 110 beats/s, {{which is the}} typical frequency found in insects. Butterflies have a much slower frequency with about 10 beats/s, {{which means that they}} can't hover. Other insects may be able to produce a frequency of 1000 beats/s. To restore the insect to its original vertical position, the average <b>upward</b> <b>force</b> during the downward stroke, Fav, must be equal to twice the weight of the insect. Note that since the <b>upward</b> <b>force</b> on the insect body is applied only for half the time, the average <b>upward</b> <b>force</b> on the insect is simply its weight.|$|R

50|$|For {{birds to}} achieve flight, they must first {{successfully}} overcome the downward pull of gravitational forces by producing lift. According to Bernoulli's Principle, a faster moving fluid produces reduced pressure than the same fluid {{moving at a}} slower speed. Because of the inherent asymmetry between {{the top and bottom}} surfaces of avian wings, also called camber, air flow velocity over the wing is faster than below, resulting in greater pressure application to the bottom surface. This pressure differential creates a net <b>upward</b> <b>force</b> on the wing, thus allowing the bird to lift off the ground, provided the <b>upward</b> <b>force</b> exceeds its weight.|$|R
50|$|The {{air flow}} changes {{direction}} {{as it passes}} the airfoil and follows a path that is curved downward. According to Newton's second law, this change in flow direction requires a downward force applied to the air by the airfoil. Then, according to Newton's third law, the air must exert an <b>upward</b> <b>force</b> on the airfoil. The overall result is that a reaction force, the lift, is generated opposite to the directional change. In {{the case of an}} airplane wing, the wing exerts a downward force on the air and the air exerts an <b>upward</b> <b>force</b> on the wing.|$|R

50|$|The Parker Variable Wing is a wing {{configuration}} in biplane or triplane aircraft {{designed by}} H.F. Parker in 1920. His design allows a supplement in lift while landing or taking-off.The system {{is depicted in}} the figure. The figure shows the biplane configuration. The lower airfoil is rigid. The upper airfoil is flexible. At high angle of attack the flow over the lower airfoil will cause the airflow to bend up and create an <b>upward</b> <b>force</b> at the lower surface of the upper airfoil. This <b>upward</b> <b>force</b> will cause the flexible section to bepushed upward. The flexible wing section is held at points A and B. The trailing edge is rigid and can rotate about point B. Due to this effect the camber of the airfoil is increased, and hence the lift it creates is increased.|$|R
