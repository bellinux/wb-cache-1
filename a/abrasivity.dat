40|$|Demands towards {{underground}} tunneling as {{an alternative}} to sustainable infrastructures has led to studies of rock <b>abrasivity</b> using Cerchar <b>Abrasivity</b> Test. There were four rock type samples involved and those samples had been identified as Granite, Carbonate Mudstone, Limestone and Sandstone through Thin Section Test. The Cerchar Test is the main concern of this research as to achieves the objectives of the test studies including identifying Cerchar <b>Abrasivity</b> Index (CAI) values and <b>abrasivity</b> properties of these four type of rocks, and also as to correlate obtained CAI values with other rock physical and mechanical properties. The geological rock material physical properties of dry density and wave velocity were obtained from Dry Density Test and Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity respectively. The mechanical characteristic of tensile strength was obtained from Brazilian Tensile Strength Test. Based on the findings, Granite has the highest <b>abrasivity</b> as its CAI is equal to 5. 70, and Limestone has the lowest <b>abrasivity,</b> CAI equal to 1. 70. Besides that, it also shows that density and wave velocity does not affect the <b>abrasivity</b> quality. However, the tensile strength and Quartz content of rock does affect the rock <b>abrasivity.</b> Granite also has the highest tensile strength among all rock samples. In short, this can be concluded that. Granite is the hardest geological to be excavated compared to Limestone, Carbonate Mudstone and Sandstone. From this study, a prediction to selection of tunneling excavation method can be evaluated as well to planning the overall tunneling construction works...|$|E
40|$|Rock <b>abrasivity</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in characterizing a rock material for excavation purposes. Abrasion can be defined as the wearing or tearing away of particles from the surface, i. e. it is a process causing removal or displacement of material at a solid surface, which will lead to wear, especially on tools that are used in mining, drilling, and tunneling applications. The CERCHAR <b>Abrasivity</b> Test is a method to determine an index called CERCHAR <b>Abrasivity</b> Index (CAI) for the rock's <b>abrasivity.</b> The test was originally developed by the Laboratoire du Centre d'Etudes et Recherches des Charbonnages (CERCHAR) de France for coal mining applications (Cerchar 1986). Two standards exist for this test method: the French standard AFNOR NF P 94 - 430 - 1 (2000) and ASTM D 7625 - 10 (2010). The test is widely used in research and practice. There are essentially two designs of testing apparatus: the original design as developed at the CERCHAR Centre (Valantin 1973) and a modified design as reported by West (1989). While the designs are similar there are some important differences as well as ambiguities in test conditions that include equipment actuation, material properties of the stylus and sample preparation as summarized by Plinninger et al.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of abrasiveness and hardness of rocks have been extensively covered by previous researchers, with {{little attention to}} flints, which were only described as highly abrasive. However, analysis of flints has shown that <b>abrasivity</b> of flints varies.

In this paper, a classification of flints (sampled from the English, French and Danish Chalk) which correlates with the <b>abrasivity</b> and hardness of flints is proposed. The results showed lighter/grey flints (with more calcite) have lower potential to cause drill bit wear as indicated by hardness and geotechnical wear indices than dark flints. This tends to suggest that even small variations in the carbonate content results in significant variation in <b>abrasivity</b> and that colour {{can be used as}} an indication of the potential of flints to cause tool wear...|$|E

LCPC test device is designed for measuring the wear particles as small as pebbles (4 - 6. 3 mm). In this study, three most important abrasive minerals were collected for analyzing {{the effect of the}} geological parameters on the ability of abrasive minerals. Firstly, amount of index minerals <b>abrasivity</b> is measured according to three standards of AFNOR P 18 - 553, AFNOR P 18 - 579 and AFNOR P 18 - 560 that are the preparation of samples for testing, procedure of laboratory tests and analysis of grain size with laboratory sieves. The effect of geological parameters affecting the wear rate of the sample, including five parameters of shape, size, angularity and saturation rate of the environment, has been studied. The effectiveness of these parameters on the <b>abrasivity</b> of samples are studied according to NF ISO 5725 relating to usage of statistics, the accuracy of test method, the repeatability and the ability to reproduce a standard way of testing within laboratory (based on classification index X 06 - 041) ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Toothbrush {{abrasion}} {{is significant}} {{in the development of}} tooth wear, particularly when combined with erosion. This in vitro study aimed to evaluate the impact of toothpaste slurry <b>abrasivity</b> and toothbrush filament stiffness on abrasion of eroded enamel. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eroded enamel samples (hydrochloric acid, pH: 2. 6, 15 s) were brushed with 40 strokes in an automatic brushing machine using manual toothbrushes with different filament stiffness (filament diameter: 0. 15, 0. 20, or 0. 25 mm). A paste-free control slurry (relative enamel abrasion (REA) value 2) and toothpaste slurries with different <b>abrasivity</b> (REA values 6 or 9) were used for brushing. Erosion and abrasion were followed by storing the enamel samples in artificial saliva for 3 h. After each 4 th cycle, the samples were stored in artificial saliva for 15 h. After 60 cycles, enamel loss was measured by profilometry and statistically analyzed by two-way and one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc tests. RESULTS: Loss of enamel (mean, microm) was influenced mainly by the <b>abrasivity</b> of the slurry and increased along with REA value (REA 2 : 0. 0 - 0. 2, REA 6 : 2. 1 - 3. 3, REA 9 : 2. 9 - 3. 7). Abrasion of eroded enamel was also affected by filament stiffness of the toothbrush, but only groups brushed with toothpaste slurry of REA 6 showed any significant difference between the different toothbrushes. Thereby, toothbrushes with 0. 2 mm filament diameter caused higher enamel loss than 0. 15 and 0. 25 mm filaments. CONCLUSIONS: Toothbrush abrasion of eroded enamel is influenced mainly by the <b>abrasivity</b> of the toothpaste slurry, but is also modified by toothbrush filament stiffness...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the long term effect of <b>abrasivity</b> of toothpastes normally used over the surface and mechanical properties of dental casting alloys. Three dental casting alloys (Ni-Cr, Co-Cr, c. p. Ti) and one ceramic were chosen. Four specimens of each material were immersed in artificial saliva, brushed without or with one of four toothpastes of different Relative Dentine <b>Abrasivity</b> (RDA 50, 52, 80, and 114). An electric toothbrush with a load of 250 g was used for 420 min. Mass loss was determined by difference in weight, microhardness and surface roughness were also measured. Two-way ANOVA and non-parametric tests were used to detect significant differences. Titanium specimens (478 microg/cm(2)) exhibited the most mass loss, whereas ceramic (282 microg/cm(2)) and Co-Cr (262 microg/cm(2)) exhibited the least. However, ceramic demonstrated the most volume loss (0. 239 mm(3)). The <b>abrasivity</b> effect of the toothpaste correlated with the RDA values. Slight variations in microhardness were observed after toothbrushing and depended on the material but not on the toothpaste used. Material surfaces were slightly smoothed by toothbrushing but no significant differences were detected. Dental casting alloys and ceramic are susceptible to abrasion by brushing with an electric toothbrush depending on the RDA value of the toothpaste. Variations in microhardness and surface roughness were not clinically relevant...|$|E
40|$|<b>Abrasivity</b> {{and wear}} {{resistance}} are not intrinsic properties of materials, but rather parameters describing {{the interaction between}} the wear part and the material exerting the wearing action. Moreover, wear or, at least, that part of the wear which is due to the cumulative effect of minute scratches, is linked to the hardness disparity concept. <b>Abrasivity,</b> in this context, is a relative concept, pertaining to a metal-rock pair, rather than to a rock. Based on this assumption, a methodology has been developed and checked against actual cases, enabling description of the abrasiveness of a rock or the abrasion resistance of a metal through the ratio of comparable quantitative indicators.

40|$|Bentonites {{are used}} for various {{industrial}} applications. Their physicochemical properties depend on the mineralogical and chemical composition, the type of smectite, the grain size distribution, the cation exchange capacity (CEC), the dominant interlayer cation (Na+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +), and the layer charge density. All these parameters can be measured with acceptable precision. Nevertheless, {{the performance of a}} bentonite in a given application is often unpredictable. An additional relevant parameter is the "microfabric" describing the arrangement of minerals and/or the intergrowth of the minerals with glass. The microfabric is supposed to affect different bentonite properties such as swelling capacity and rheology. The present study focuses on the influence of different microfabrics on the <b>abrasivity</b> by bentonite dispersions. The <b>abrasivity</b> of bentonite dispersions mainly depended on two factors: 1) on the amount of hard and sharp accessory minerals and volcanic glass and 2) the grain size distribution, which was produced by different grinding techniques. The <b>abrasivity</b> increased with decreasing grain size, which was caused by breaking the hard components (minerals and glass) leading to an increased number of sharp edges. In addition, there was evidence for a subordinate influence of the type of exchangeable cations. This influence is explained by the different relative arrangements of smectite particles towards the surfaces of hard and sharp minerals. Na+ exchanged glass rich samples showed higher abrasion values than the Ca 2 + exchanged samples. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Toothbrushing with toothpastes is an {{important}} personal care activity resulting in the removal of stains, food debris and plaque from our teeth. Furthermore fluoridated toothpastes protect our teeth against caries {{by means of the}} cariostatic fluoride action(s). Nearly all toothpastes contain abrasive systems. Toothpastes without abrasives leave stain problems at least in part of the population. This thesis deals especially with the abrasive effects from toothpastes on human enamel. As mentioned a small amount of abrasion is necessary for an optimum stain and plaque removal. However, toothpastes are used on two very different hard tissues: enamel and dentin. If the gingiva is not retracted the toothpaste will be in contact only with the enamel which covers the tooth crown. When the gingiva is retracted, as is often in case in the older part of the population, enamel is brushed by the toothpaste as well as cementum covering the root dentin. (the cement covers the dentin in a very thin layer and is easily removed by brushing; it is not discussed further.) Exposed dentin on the roots of our teeth is quite easily abraded. Therefore toothpaste producers test toothpastes on the abrasive sensitive dentin also because dentin abrasion is easy to measure. The simplicity of dentin <b>abrasivity</b> measurements combined with the fact that an <b>abrasivity</b> ratio between dentin and enamel has been presumed, has as a consequence that the number of toothpaste <b>abrasivity</b> studies on enamel is very limited.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Background: Toothpaste <b>abrasivity</b> is {{considered}} the major contributor in toothbrushing abrasive wear, while toothbrush stiffness {{can be considered a}} secondary factor that may modify the <b>abrasivity</b> of toothpaste. Objectives: To investigate the longitudinal enamel and dentin surface loss caused by the interaction between the abrasives in toothpaste and toothbrush filament stiffness. Study Hypothesis: The amount of enamel and dentin loss depends on the <b>abrasivity</b> of the toothpaste and the filament stiffness of toothbrush. Materials and Methods: The following experimental factors were considered: abrasive suspension, at two levels (L-low: Z 113 and H-high: Z 103); and toothbrushes at three levels determined by bristle stiffness (soft, medium, and hard) generating 6 testing groups (n = 8). Slabs of bovine enamel and dentin were cut, embedded in acrylic resin, and polished. UPVC tapes were placed {{on the surface of the}} specimens, leaving an area of 1 × 4 mm exposed in the center of the each enamel slab. Specimens (n = 8) were subjected to 5 d of erosion/abrasion cycling: erosion (5 min, 4 ×/d, 0. 3 % citric acid, pH 3. 75), abrasion (15 s, 2 ×/d, 45 strokes each, 150 -g load, automated brushing machine), fluoride treatment (15 s with abrasion and 45 s without abrasion; 275 ppm F as NaF in abrasive slurry) with exposure to artificial saliva between erosion and abrasion (1 h) and all other times (overnight). Surface loss (SL, in micrometers) was determined by optical profilometry, after the third and fifth days of cycling. Data were analyzed using three-way ANOVA (alpha = 0. 05). For enamel, only cycling time was found to affect surface loss with 5 d > 3 d. Overall, there was little SL (mean range: 0. 76 µm to 1. 85 µm). For dentin (mean SL range: 1. 87 µm to 5. 91 µm), significantly higher SL was found for 5 d vs. 3 d, with particularly large differences for hard toothbrush high abrasive, and medium toothbrush/low abrasive. Hard toothbrush resulted in significantly higher SL than medium toothbrush for high abrasive after 5 d, with no other significant stiffness differences. High abrasive had significantly higher SL than low abrasive overall with strong effects for all combinations, except medium stiffness after 5 d. In conclusion, the interplay between <b>abrasivity</b> and filament stiffness appears to be more relevant for dentin than enamel...|$|E

As deep exploration in hard rocks is accelerated due to the depletion of near ground mineral resources, deep-drilling operations need to reduce their reliance in operators experience and begin to implement new technologies {{in order to increase}} efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the overall process. Currently, lack of real-time information on the bit/rock interaction is a major problem. Therefore the mechanism behind the acoustic emission, which is a proven technique for remote monitoring, generation in mechanical rock cutting must be understood in order to provide real time information about the rock. This paper aims to identify the influence of mineral composition of granitic rocks on the acoustic emission (AE) during rock <b>abrasivity</b> test with a single contact tool and to evaluate the feasibility of AE as a means to infer Cerchar <b>Abrasivity</b> Index (CAI). Single contact tool will provide precise and accurate description of the source of AE. To provide constant grooving speed Cerchar apparatus was modified to monitor AE during rock/tool interaction. Tests on the modified Cerchar apparatus are carried out under the static load of 70 N and cutting speed of 1 mm/s. A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is utilized to visualize the groove in the rock and to identify the mineral composition through Back-Scattered Electrons (BSE) reflected from the rock sample. Based on the microscope images, it was found that biotite shows a larger groove area and plate-like fractures accompanied with burst-type AE signal, whereas plagioclase and quartz, which are characterized by similar hardness and BSE brightness, possess shattered-like fractures and more continuous-type AE signals.

40|$|Drilling and {{blasting}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used and convenient method for many mining and civil applications to break rocks, especially hard rocks. Because of many environmental, safety and productivity issues (i. e. Cycle time), the industry and contractors are looking for an alternative system of breaking of rocks. In underground rock breakage applications such as tunneling, continuous mechanical excavation method, normally with tunnel boring machines (TBMs) or road headers is becoming more popular and commonly used by contractors. One of the main disadvantages of such system is that, it cannot handle very hard rocks and uneconomical major disc or bit wear takes place. Today, novel explosive free rock breaking technologies (thermal, electrical, nuclear energy and microwave) are available and could be used on their own or assist mechanical conventional machines to be able to break harder rock material. This is possible because it is hoped that the microwave will reduce the strength of the rock prior to the impact of mechanical device. Three main mechanical parameters of rocks such as compressive strength, tensile strength and <b>abrasivity</b> index value were used to highlight the influence of microwave on to the mechanical properties of rocks. Seven different rock types were prepared and tested. Each individual specimen was exposed to the microwave energy in three power levels 800, 1250 and 3000 watts, within 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 seconds time of exposure. Different rocks due to their mineralogy behave differently when exposed to microwave energy. CERCHAR <b>abrasivity</b> index value of almost all samples shows reduction of about 30 % as the power level of exposure increases. The tensile strength of certain samples reduces significantly as in basalt reduces of up to 80 %. The unconfined compressive strength value of almost all samples reduces about 30 % as well. The reduction of the strength and <b>abrasivity</b> of hard rock cause the penetration rate and the life time of cutter tools of a TBM to be increased by combining the microwave energy to the cutter head of the mechanical excavator...|$|E

METHODS: Eroded dentin samples (hydrochloric acid, pH 2. 6, 15 s) were brushed with 40 strokes in an automatic brushing machine using manual toothbrushes with different filament diameter (0. 15, 0. 20 or 0. 25 mm). The toothbrushes were applied with a control slurry free of abrasive particles (RDA-value 10) or toothpastes slurries with different <b>abrasivity</b> (RDA-values 20, 50 or 100). Each erosive-abrasive cycle was followed by storage of the dentin samples in artificial saliva for 3 h. After each 4 cycles, the samples were stored in artificial saliva for 15 h. After 60 cycles, dentin loss was measured by profilometry and statistically analysed by ANOVA and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Dentin loss increased along with the RDA-value of the toothpaste slurries. The impact of the filament diameter on dentin loss was less evident compared to the RDA-value. However, toothbrushes with smaller filament stiffness caused higher dentin wear in all toothpaste slurry groups (RDA 20, 50 and 100) except for the paste-free control group (RDA 10).

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{detailed}} {{studies were}} carried out to determine the influence of rock properties on the penetration rate during pneumatic drilling. Further investigation was also carried out on the effect of thrust, air pressure, and compressive strength on penetration rate. Rock properties, like compressive strength and <b>abrasivity</b> of various samples collected from the field were determined in the laboratory. Drilling experiments {{were carried out}} on ten different rock samples for varying thrust, air pressure values and bit diameter. It was observed that very low thrust results in low penetration rate. Even very high thrust does not produce high penetration rate at higher operating air pressures. With increase in thrust beyond the optimum level the penetration rate starts decreasing and causes the drill bit to ‘stall’. Results of the study show that penetration rate increases with increase in the thrust level. After reaching the maximum, they start decreasing despite the increase of thrust. The main purpose of the study is to develop a general prediction model and to investigate the relationships between penetration rate during drilling and physical properties such as uniaxial compressive strength and <b>abrasivity</b> of sedimentary rocks.

40|$|Increased {{urbanisation}} constantly demands more infrastructure, often {{requiring the}} construction of tunnels and facilities underground. The complexity of Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) function and the complicated nature of soft ground and soil working environments make the estimation of wear a challenging issue. The following tests and procedures {{are included in the}} original contribution to this PhD study; 1) an overview and presentation of various laboratory methods designed to estimate and assess soil <b>abrasivity</b> in connection with soft ground TBM tunnelling, 2) the development of models, based on simplified laboratory tests, for the estimation of TBM tool life when excavating soil and soft ground, 3) the development of the Soft Ground Abrasion Tester (SGAT), designed to increase the validity of simplified estimation tools. The simplified laboratory tests incorporate the Soil Abrasion Test (SAT™), quartz content measurements, and the geotechnical uniformity index Cu. Test results have been correlated with, and validated against, TBM tool life and performance data from 16 TBM projects. Laboratory test results obtained from the SAT™ provide a good estimation of soft ground excavation tool life. Furthermore, an empirical formula obtained by means of multiple regression analysis using SAT™ and Cu values as variables, and soft ground tool life as the dependent variable, has been derived, and provides a good estimation of soft ground excavation tool life. In addition, the validity of the formula is evaluated against an on-going European TBM tunnelling project. The SGAT has been developed in order to study how variation in geotechnical parameters such as soil compaction and density, water content, groundwater pressure and soil conditioning additive’s influence the <b>abrasivity</b> of soils. Furthermore, the SGAT provides opportunities to measure the influence of abrasive wear by varying TBM parameters such as thrust, rpm and torque. The main results obtained from the SGAT are that the moisture content of a soil sample, and thus its compactibility, influences soil <b>abrasivity</b> by as much as ± 250 %. There is a clear correlation between measured weight loss and torque requirement, and a reduction of torque by approximately 40 % is achievable with proper soil conditioning. In addition, measured wear can be as low as 20 % of that for an unconditioned sample. Research results have been achieved mainly by using the following four approaches, 1) literature studies, 2) laboratory tests, 3) field research, and 4) discussions and experience sharing with individuals, users and experts in the tunnelling industry. These methods were chosen since they offer a variety of approaches to the complex problem of soil <b>abrasivity</b> in soft ground TBM tunnelling, and to avoid an exclusive focus on any single source such as ideal laboratory tests, published literature or field experience.

Three dental casting alloys (Ni-Cr, Co-Cr and commercially pure Ti) were studied. Four specimens of each material were immersed, brushed without paste or brushed with one of four toothpastes of different Relative Dentine <b>Abrasivity</b> (RDA 50, 52, 80, and 114). An electric toothbrush with a load of 250 g was used for 420 min.

Two-way ANOVA and non-parametric tests were used to detect significant differences. Titanium specimens exhibited the best corrosion behavior after and before the toothbrushed, being the worst of the three alloys the Cr-Ni. Titanium oxide produced spontaneously on the Ti surface is the main cause of the high corrosion resistance of the material. However, the eutectoid of the CrNi with chemical composition between different phases produces pitting on the phases boundaries with an important decrease of the corrosion resistance. Besides, the CrNi produces high values of the Ni and Cr release. Slight increment in roughness were observed after toothbrushing and depended on the material but not on the toothpaste used.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Background: Non-carious {{cervical}} lesions (NCCLs) can {{be defined}} as the loss of dental hard tissue near the cemento-enamel junction without bacterial involvement. Abrasion, erosion and abfraction have been mentioned as common etiological factors of NCCLs. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure due to friction by materials such as toothbrushes or abrasives in toothpaste. In contrast, dental erosion is the loss of tooth structure driven by acids. Abfraction, on the other hand, starts due to the weakening of the tooth structure in areas of concentrated stress as a result of cuspal flexure from heavy and repeated occlusal loading, which progresses to dental hard-tissue loss. Purpose: The present study focused on the abrasion aspect of NCCLs. Specifically, it aimed to investigate the influence of dentifrice <b>abrasivity</b> and toothbrush stiffness on the development of NCCLs in vitro Hypothesis: NCCL development is affected by both the abrasive level of the dentifrice and the stiffness of the toothbrush, as well as their interaction. Materials and Methods: A total of 288 extracted human upper first premolars, free of any dental caries and root defects, were selected. The teeth were be cleaned with a hand periodontal scaler and randomly assigned into twelve groups (total of 24 teeth/group). Specimens were brushed in an automated toothbrushing machine, using simulated toothpaste slurries of varying <b>abrasivity</b> and toothbrushes of varying stiffness. This study examined three experimental factors: 1. Toothpaste <b>abrasivity,</b> at four levels: high, medium, low, and non-abrasive slurry (as negative control); 2. Toothbrush stiffness, at three levels: soft, medium, and hard; 3. Toothbrushing cycles at three levels: baseline, 35 k, and 65 k strokes. Specimens were analyzed by optical profilometry at baseline and after each brushing level. The response variable was the dentin volumetric loss, in mm 3. All toothbrushes caused significantly higher tooth wear when associated to the high abrasive slurry, compared to medium- and low-abrasive slurries. Medium- caused more tooth wear than low-abrasive slurry, which in turn led to more tooth wear than the control. Hard and medium toothbrushes were not significantly different, but both caused significantly higher volumetric loss than Soft toothbrushes. There were no differences among toothbrushes, when used with the non-abrasive (control) and low- abrasive slurries.

The specimens from EA and E were treated with 1 % citric acid (pH 2. 3) for 1 min rinsed, and neutralized with artificial saliva for 15 min. This cycle was repeated five times. Thereafter, specimens from EA and A were treated with three toothbrushes types with different bristle stiffness (soft, medium, and hard) in a custom-made toothbrushing machine. The brushing was performed at a load of 3 N with a toothpaste slurry for 630 s. This procedure was repeated five times, in group EA after each erosion cycle. EA and A groups passed through five cycles with a total of 6300 strokes. The <b>abrasivity</b> was analyzed by contact-free profilometry. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were performed for statistical analysis. With respect to bristle stiffness there was no statistically significant difference in dentin loss within the EA group. In group A, a statistically significantly higher dentin loss was found for the soft in comparison to the hard bristles. No statistically significant differences were measured between soft/medium and medium/hard toothbrushes. The amount of dentin loss from specimens in the EA group was significantly higher than in the A group. Within the limitations of this study, the dentin loss in the Abrasion group was higher with soft bristles than with hard ones.

40|$|Rubbers are {{interesting}} materials and are extensively {{used in many}} mining industries for material transportation. Wear of rubber {{is a very complex}} phenomenon to understand. The present study aims to explain the influence of rock properties on wear of M and SR grade rubber used in top cover of conveyor belts. Extensive laboratory experiments were conducted under four combinations of normal load and sliding speed. The wear of both the rubber types were analyzed based on the rock properties like shear strength, <b>abrasivity</b> index and fractal dimension. A fully instrumented testing set up was used to study the wear of rubber samples under different operating conditions. In general, wear was higher for M grade rubber compared to SR grade rubber. Increase in shear strength of rocks depicts decreasing trend for the wear of M and SR grade rubber at lower load conditions. Moreover, a higher load combination displays no definite trend in both the rubbers. The strong correlation between the wear of rubber and frictional power for all rubber-rock combinations has given rise to the parameter A, which reflects the relative compatibility between the rubber and rock. Increase of Cerchar’s <b>Abrasivity</b> Index of rocks shows gradual enhancement in wear for M grade rubber in all the load and speed combinations whereas, it fails in SR grade rubber due to its higher strength. The wear of rubber tends to decrease marginally with the surface roughness of rocks at highest normal load and sliding speed in M grade rubber. However, the wear of M and SR grade rubber is influenced by the surface roughness of rocks...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper reports {{selected}} {{results of}} a study on tool wear for mechanized tunnelling in coarse soil. Several laboratory soil abrasion tests were performed and the results correlated with mineralogical composition, shape and surface roughness of the grains and the grain size curve of the soils. The analysis of the results clearly confirms the well-known correlation between soil <b>abrasivity</b> and quartz content and, for the soils tested, can quantify the relevant influence of grain size and grain roughness. We also report and discuss results useful for quantifying {{the positive effect of}} the addition of different chemical agents, injected as foams in a process known as soil conditioning, commonly performed in mechanized tunnel excavation using tunnel boring machines whit earth pressure technology to minimise tool consumption...|$|E
40|$|Certain {{chemical}} solutions {{have been}} shown to reduce the degradation effect of water on the material properties of rock and increase the strength and cuttability of clay-bearing rock. Consequently, there is potential for the application of chemical solutions to enhance the cutting performance of mechanical excavators and for maintaining ground stability in clay-bearing rocks that exist surrounding coal formations. A study investigated the effect of temperature of chemical solutions on rock properties. The temperatures ranged between 5 ⁰C and 40 ⁰C. It was found that temperature effect varied with different solutions. In the case of potassium chloride, there were changes in <b>abrasivity,</b> weatherability and cuttability of rock with temperature whereas the results were less consistent with magnesium chloride and copper sulphate solutions...|$|E

30|$|Based on {{the results}} of the study it can be {{concluded}} that the application of the SM would benefit overburden removal from the environmental point of view. The downside of using the SM in surface mining operations begins with the limited quantity of the overburden material being extracted and higher operating cost than conventional mining methods. An application problem arises with higher values of unconfined compressive strength and <b>abrasivity</b> of overburden material. Picks on the cutting drum will wear out faster and require more changes. At a certain point this method becomes unfeasible due to the slower advance rate and cost involved in a high amount of pick changes. New pick changing tools have accelerated this process, but it still remains one of the main factors of the operating cost.|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing {{operations}} such as {{die cutting}} and slitting of sheet materials result in wear of the tooling. A new method {{for measuring the}} abrasive properties of paper and other sheet materials is proposed. The method continuously monitors the force required for penetrating a sheet sample as multiple punches are made with a needle. Abrasive wear caused by the sheet sample changes the geometry of the needle, and consequently changes the penetration force. The trend of the force {{is used as a}} measure of the <b>abrasivity</b> of the sheet sample. Several sheet paper samples were tested using this method with two different needle geometries. In all cases, the magnitude of the force decreased with an increasing number of punches. The rate of change of force depends on the type of paper and the initial geometry of the needle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports the}} use of thin film {{hydroxyapatite}} (HA) coatings, deposited by RF magnetron sputtering, as a possible model dental surface. Dissolution behavior of the coatings has been monitored by exposure to Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) solution for periods of 1 hr, 24 hrs and 7 days and analyzed by FTIR, XPS and AFM. Coatings sputter deposited at 15 mTorr argon gas pressure {{proved to be the}} most stable, with post deposition annealing to 500 °C noted to further enhance the stability of the coating. Micro- and nano-indentation techniques indicate that the HA coatings exhibit hardness values close to that of polished human enamel samples. Wear tests have been conducted in the presence of toothpaste of varying <b>abrasivity</b> and also indicate that the HA coatings perform in a similar manner to the enamel controls...|$|E
40|$|Hardness {{together}} with <b>abrasivity</b> is quite {{often used in}} the field of wear resistance as the criteria for judging surfaces of the alloys, castings, hardfacings and overlays. This research is devoted to the investigation of microhardness phenomena of poly (ethylene terephatalate) (PET) blends with polyolefins and thermoplastic elastomers. The effect of radiation modification and chemical compatibilization (polypropylene grafted maleic anhydride) on the microdeformative and structural properties of the investigated compositions was determined. It was concluded that micromechanical properties of the investigated compositions – especially those with higher PET content – were strongly dependent from the crystallinity of polyester. By increasing PET content in the investigated multiphase systems universal microhardness and microhardness modulus increased, but microcreep decreased, that allowed assume that wear resistance of the compositions also increased. Besides it was found out {{that as a result of}} radiation modification microhardness of the investigated compositions increase...|$|E
30|$|The broad {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to improve current surface mining practices and reduce negative environmental impact of overburden removal in West Virginia (WV). The specific objectives were to (i) compare conventional surface mining method (drilling, blasting, digging, and loading) to a surface miner (SM) method, and (ii) apply the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to help select the optimal mining method based on production, cost and environmental criteria. The design and the procedures used in this research involve five interrelated modules: (i) rock properties of overburden in WV, (ii) drilling and blasting, (iii) digging and loading, (iv) SM method, and (v) comparative analysis and selection of the optimal mining method by AHP. Results of this research indicate that application of SM method would yield higher cost of overburden removal than conventional mining methods in rocks with a high unconfined compressive strength and <b>abrasivity.</b> A significant advantage of SM method, where applicable, is the elimination of the negative environmental impacts associated with blasting.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Rock {{mechanical}} parameters {{gained from}} laboratory investigations (i. e. Unconfined Compressive Strength, Tensile Strength, Shear Strength or <b>Abrasivity)</b> are key {{values for the}} mechanical description and classification of any hardrock type. Conse-quently such investigations are of crucial importance {{in the course of}} any preliminary site investigation program conducted for infrastructure projects in hardrock conditions. Espe-cially under the aspect of increasing measuring accuracy and increasingly complex hardrock testing methods the fact has to be faced, that the accuracy of the gained parameters may not only be connected to the (precisely defined) testing setup and (precisely defined) testing circumstances but in an increasingly manner influenced by the process of sampling. This paper represents theoretical backgrounds and practical approaches (including an easy-to-use “flow-chart ” like guideline) on hardrock sampling. A special focus is put on the sampling and treatment of anisotropic and non-durable rock types and aspects of block sampling as an alternative sample source to core drillings. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the production rate (PR) and cutting performance of surface miners (SM) based on rock properties and specific energy (SE). We use data from equipment manufacturers and experimental data in this study and propose a new method and equations to determine both the PR and the cutting speed of SM. The unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the rock, its <b>abrasivity,</b> and the machine's engine power are the three most important factors influencing the PR. Moreover, the cutting depth, UCS, and engine power {{have a significant impact on}} the cutting speed. We propose a new method and equations to determine the energy required to cut a volume unit and a surface unit, i. e., specific energy, and establish the relationship between SE, UCS, and PR. The results of this study can be used by surface miner operators to evaluate the applicability of the machines to a specific mine site...|$|E
