5|$|The game's {{main hub}} is the Comet Observatory, a {{spaceship}} which contains six themed domes that {{provide access to}} the 42 galaxies available in the game. Five of the domes end with a boss level in which {{the objective is to}} defeat Bowser or Bowser Jr., which then gives the player access to the next dome via acquiring a collectable called a Grand Star. The player only has access to a few galaxies when they begin the game; as more Power Stars <b>are</b> <b>collected,</b> more galaxies become available. The player is awarded the ability to play as Luigi after collecting 120 Power Stars as Mario. Once 120 Power Stars <b>are</b> <b>collected</b> with both characters, the player is rewarded one further challenge for Mario and Luigi to complete, which upon completion, awards the player with two commemorative pictures that can be sent to the Wii Message Board.|$|E
