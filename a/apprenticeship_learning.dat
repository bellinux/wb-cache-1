50|$|In summary, <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>learning</b> is {{a method}} used by {{teachers}} to teach students about a specific task. It is utilized in a problematic situation so students know how to react {{when faced with a}} similar situation. Students work very closely with an expert at learning a specific skill. <b>Apprenticeship</b> <b>learning</b> is very beneficial to the learner.|$|E

5000|$|One domain where <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>learning</b> {{has been}} used {{extensively}} is helicopter control. While simple trajectories can be intuitively derived, complicated tasks like aerobatics for shows has been successful. These include aerobatic maneuvers like - in-place flips, in-place rolls, loops, hurricanes and even auto-rotation landings. This work was developed by Pieter Abbeel, Adam Coates, and Andrew Ng - [...] "Autonomous Helicopter Aerobatics through Apprenticeship Learning" ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Apprenticeship</b> <b>learning</b> {{has been}} used to model reward {{functions}} of highly dynamic scenarios where there is no obvious reward function intuitively. Take the task of driving for example, there are many different objectives working simultaneously - such as maintaining safe following distance, a good speed, not changing lanes too often, etc. This task, may seem easy at first glance, but a trivial reward function may not converge to the policy wanted.|$|E
50|$|Early {{on in his}} life, {{his father}} {{recognized}} his aptitude for mechanics and academics and worked on his behalf to have his son admitted to the Carl Zeiss Optical Works in Jena, Germany.

5000|$|<b>Apprenticeship</b> <b>learning,</b> or {{apprenticeship}} via inverse {{reinforcement learning}} (AIRP), {{is a concept}} {{in the field of}} artificial intelligence and machine learning, developed by Pieter Abbeel, Associate Professor in Berkeley's EECS department, and Andrew Ng, Associate Professor in Stanford University's Computer Science Department. It was incepted in 2004. AIRP deals with [...] "Markov decision process where we are not explicitly given a reward function, but where instead we can observe an expert demonstrating the task that we want to learn to perform" ...|$|E
5000|$|These {{three goals}} have been {{accomplished}} based on published literature, learners feel apprenticeship [...] "learning experience expands their {{awareness of the}} factors that should be considered' helps them organize and pay attention to their thought processes while handling difficult tasks, problems, and problematic situations; and emphasizes the importance of particular aspects of such tasks, problems, and problematic situations previously ignored or regarded as unimportant" [...] (Brandt et al., 1993). Clearly the three goals of <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>learning</b> have been accomplished. Learners have been able to discover what works in situations, and knows how to handles problems and finally the learner can perform at a satisfactory level.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} Year of Robotics program, Hollerbach {{collaborated with}} Stephen Jacobsen and John Wood at the University of Utah to design, construction, and control a multi-fingered hand. The project began in 1981 and was {{completed}} in 1987. The hand design consisted of a 16-joint four-finger manipulator that used 32 artificial tendons sensing via the Hall effect. 12 copies were made {{for use in a}} variety of contexts. At the NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Ken Perlin, James Demmel, and Paul K. Wright obtained a copy to build simulation software for the hand. Carnegie Mellon University, Columbia University, University of Rochester and other university research labs obtained copies to explore multi-agent control, teleoperation, and <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>learning.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Shortly after {{arriving}} in Michigan, Overpack entered into <b>apprenticeship</b> of <b>learning</b> the wagon-making trade. In 1868 he moved to Manistee {{and set up a}} blacksmith and wagon making business downtown. There he made wagons and sleighs for the thriving lumber industry of northern Michigan. He also sold salt, mill carts, blankets, harnesses, whips, and ropes. He usually employed anywhere from twelve to fifteen people at any one time.|$|R

After the closure of the Indra because of complaints about the noise, the Beatles played in the Kaiserkeller, starting on 4 October 1960.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>learning</b> — {{learning from}} expert demonstrations — {{in the setting}} of large, complex domains. Past work in <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>learning</b> requires that the expert demonstrate complete trajectories through the domain, but in many problems where even an expert has difficulty controlling the system, this is infeasible. For example, consider the task of teaching a quadruped robot to navigate over extreme terrain; demonstrating an optimal policy (i. e., an optimal set of foot locations over the entire terrain) is a highly non-trivial task, even for an expert. In this paper we propose a method for hierarchical <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>learning,</b> which allows the algorithm to accept isolated advice at different hierarchical levels of the control task. This type of advice is often feasible for experts to give, even if the expert is unable to demonstrate full trajectories. This thus allows us to extend the <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>learning</b> paradigm to much larger, more challenging domains. In particular, in this paper we apply the hierarchical <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>learning</b> algorithm to the task of quadruped locomotion over extreme terrain, and achieve, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, results superior to any previously published work. ...|$|E
40|$|In <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>learning,</b> {{the goal}} is to learn a policy in a Markov {{decision}} process that is at least as good as a policy demonstrated by an expert. The difficulty arises in that the MDP’s true reward function is assumed to be unknown. We show how to frame <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>learning</b> as a linear programming problem, and show that using an off-the-shelf LP solver to solve this problem results in a substantial improvement in running time over existing methods — up to two orders of magnitude faster in our experiments. Additionally, our approach produces stationary policies, while all existing methods for <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>learning</b> output policies that are “mixed”, i. e. randomized combinations of stationary policies. The technique used is general enough to convert any mixed policy to a stationary policy. 1...|$|E
