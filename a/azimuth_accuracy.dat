50|$|The {{second major}} {{improvement}} is increased <b>azimuth</b> <b>accuracy.</b> With PSRs and old SSRs, azimuth {{of the aircraft}} {{is determined by the}} half split (centroid) method. The half split method is computed by recording the azimuth of the first and last replies from the aircraft, as the radar beam sweeps past its position. Then the midpoint between the start and stop azimuth is used for aircraft position. With MSSR (monopulse secondary surveillance radar) and Mode S, the radar can use the information of one reply to determine azimuth. This is calculated based on the RF phase of the aircraft reply, as determined by the sum and difference antenna elements, and is called monopulse. This monopulse method results in superior azimuth resolution, and removes target jitter from the display.|$|E

However, it will suffer cyclic ambiguity in its angle estimates {{according to the}} spatial Nyquist sampling theorem since the large sparse array is undersampling.
