25|$|Most jurisdictions {{imposing}} {{an income}} tax treat capital gains as part of income subject to tax. Capital gain is generally a gain on sale of capital assets—that is, those <b>assets</b> not <b>held</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> in the ordinary course of business. Capital assets include personal assets in many jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions provide preferential rates of tax or only partial taxation for capital gains. Some jurisdictions impose different rates or levels of capital gains taxation based {{on the length of}} time the <b>asset</b> was <b>held.</b> Because tax rates are often much lower for capital gains than for ordinary income, there is widespread controversy and dispute about the proper definition of capital. Some tax scholars have argued that differences in the ways different kinds of capital and investment are taxed contribute to economic distortions.|$|R
25|$|Taxable income {{includes}} capital gains. However, {{individuals are}} taxed {{at a lower}} rate on long term capital gains and qualifying dividends (see below). A capital gain is the excess of the sales price over the tax basis (usually, the cost) of capital assets, generally those <b>assets</b> not <b>held</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> to customers in the ordinary course of business. Capital losses (where basis is more than sales price) are deductible, but deduction for long term capital losses {{is limited to the}} total capital gains for the year, plus for individuals up to $3,000 of ordinary income ($1,500 if married filing separately). An individual may exclude $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of capital gains on the sale of the individual's primary residence, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Gains on depreciable property used in a business are treated as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation previously claimed.|$|R

40|$|International Financial Reporting Standard 5 has {{the working}} title Non-current <b>assets</b> <b>held</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> and {{discontinued}} operations. This fi nancial reporting standard also represents {{a new group}} of standards along with the previous four, including existing International Accounting Standard, regardless if it concerns existing or revised standards, as a wish for further coordination of accounting regulations on world level. This idea is a concretisation of the wishes of International Accounting Standards Board, that at prior wish to establish specific rules in woods of existing rules imposing financial reporting standards as vital in financial reporting. This standard replaces existing International Accounting Standard 35 - Discontinuing Operations and achieves substantial convergence with the requirements of SFAS 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Non-current Assets that are synonyms for <b>assets</b> <b>held</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale,</b> followed by specifying the conditions for its classification, and in the final are determined the ways of presentation and publishing of those type of activities.

40|$|Under the Korean {{equivalents}} of International Financial Reporting Standards (K-IFRS), {{which was}} adopted in 2011, companies {{are allowed to}} recognize gains/losses on disposal of discontinued operations (GDDO) when they spin off part of their operations. GDDO reflects {{the gap between the}} fair value and the book value of the spun-off operations. However, the fair value is not based on the fair value of the <b>assets</b> classified as <b>held</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> but based on the valuation of the operation by using the Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) method. Since the FCFF method estimates the value of the operation by discounting all future free cash flows from the operation, it is not accurate but varies remarkably with a small change in the discount factor. Furthermore, only spun-off operations are evaluated, but sustained operations are not. Lastly, shareholders of the parent company receive equivalent shares in the new company in order to compensate for the loss of equity in the original stocks. This implies {{that there should be no}} gains/losses from the division of the company unless there is a huge quantifiable impact from spinning off. For these reasons, it is improper to see GDDO as a real gain; rather, it is proper to see it as a paper gain. According to the extended functional fixation view, unsophisticated investors improperly implement a wrong analysis of such complicated accounting information into their investment decision making. Herein I attempt to test whether unsophisticated investors are affected by GDDO with an assumption that there are some unsophisticated marginal investors who see GDDO as a real gain and they impound this information in price. My hypothesis is tested by examining the stock price reaction to quarterly earnings announcements of firms which have undergone spin-offs since K-IFRS was adopted. On the financial performance announcement date, the firm's stock price is theoretically affected by the difference between the real earnings and the expected earnings (earnings surprise: ES). In a case in which the firm announced earnings including GDDO, only the real earnings, excluding GDDO, less the expected earnings should be reflected in the stock price movement-if all investors are sophisticated enough not to regard GDDO as real earnings. However, I test whether GDDO also affects the stock price movement in this situation separately from the impact from the earnings surprise, which implies that there are unsophisticated investors and the extended functional fixation hypothesis holds in the GDDO case. Eleven Korean companies that are traded on the Korean stock market and listed on the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) were subjected to the test. These companies meet the following constraints: (1) They have undergone spin-offs, and (2) They recognized GDDO on their income statement but do not directly add or deduct the amount from equity items on the balance sheet. I run a regression test on the excess stock return which is calculated by using historical two-day return, historical beta, the impact from earning surprise (ES), and the impact from GDDO. The result shows higher R² and lower p-value for the case when both the ES and GDDO are chosen as x-variables than the case when the earnings surprise is solely chosen as an x-variable. The p-values for x-variables in both cases were smaller than 0. 01. The test result implies that the extended functional fixation hypothesis might hold in this case. I conclude that including GDDO as an item on the income statement can affect some investors' decision making and demand for the stock. by Chunsoo Park. Thesis: S.

Internationally their accounting treatment is presented by the IAS 40 Investment property issued in 2000 and being operative for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2001 with a number of subsequent amendments. First step in aligning the Romanian accounting system (RAS) to the international accounting and financial reporting standards has manifested in terms of properties starting with 2012 but only for the listed companies - OMFP 1286 which has brought significant changes in the execution way of the individual financial statements of these companies and in terms of the accounting presentation of the investment properties and fixed <b>assets</b> <b>held</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale.</b> In accordance with this order and the Romanian accounting rules recognize investment properties as being a separate component of the fixed assets, applying the provisions of IAS 40.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the accounting reform of public finances {{from the point}} of view of its impact on the financial statements of local government units, especially applied to the municipalities in the Vysocina region. The reform changed legislative regulations, especially the accounting law, the decree implementing the accounting law and Czech accounting standards for the selected accounting entities. This thesis analyzes the changes in these regulations and it describes the impact of these modifications on the financial statements. These changes create areas that are, due to the reform, new for villages and can be problematic in context of misinterpretations and wrong booking. The areas affected by the reform are divided into three separate areas. The first area is the creation of state accountancy and implementation of accrual based accounting, connected to the state accounting, from which the further accrual principle is derived. The second imaginary area of changes relates to accounting reform in terms of chart of accounts including an off-balance sheet which has considerably changed. The third area is a wide range of assets of an entity, where there was a major change in relation to the accrual principle and that is the beginning of depreciation of all depreciable assets. In connection with depreciation, adjustments are made and the problem area of inventory of property has widened. Changes occurred in valuation of assets, a new way was created and an obligation to revalue <b>assets</b> <b>held</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> was made. Subsequently, the impact of individual problem areas at the municipalities is examined, and so as how the changes will be reflected in their financial statements...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} my {{bachelor}} thesis {{is the final}} accounts according to the International Financial Reporting Standarts, especially, the first transformation of the final accounts from the czech accounting legislation to the IFRS. In the first part I present the theoretical basis which is necessary to know for a realization of reporting according to the IFRS and I mention to whom is it related to. In a practical part I realized the first transformation of the financial statements to the IFRS to 31. 12. 2007 in one middle-sized czech company which is focused on goods traffic and repair business. Considering {{the size of my}} work I chose the most important items and account cases which we can find in most of the companies and which solve the IFRS differently. Especially, it refers to the investment property, non-current <b>assets</b> <b>held</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale,</b> evaluation of assets, provisions, financial leasing, deferred tax and long-term receivables. I was interested how difficult such transformation is and to how big differences in the reported items can it lead. It is evident from the tranformation that the differences in the reporting between Czech accounting legislation and the IFRS are considerable. That is why I was interested in which principles both of the methods differ and which of them correspond more to the principle of a true and full display. In this confrontation the IFRS is winning which try to display the whole property from which the account unit has an economical profit and display his real value as well. On the other hand, the IFRS are far liberal, they often provide a choice of several different possibilities for reporting of some items what obstructs the principle of a comparability of the particular companies. One of the disadvantages of the IFRS is its demandingness, it requires better cooperation between the accountants, management and experts. The Standarts are not written in a comprehensible way, they are too large and there is a shoortage of a practical book and a software for the realization of a transformation in the market. Especially, for the small and middle-sized companies the transformation is a big burden and it leads to a generation of some special standart for them today...|$|E
