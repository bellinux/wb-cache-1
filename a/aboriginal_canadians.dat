25|$|Wolves were {{generally}} revered by <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>Canadians</b> that survived by hunting, but were thought little of by those that survived through agriculture. Some Alaska Natives including the Nunamiut of both northern and northwestern Alaska respected the wolf's hunting skill {{and tried to}} emulate the wolf in order to hunt successfully. First Nations such as Naskapi as well as Squamish and Lil'wat view the wolf as a daytime hunting guide. The Naskapis believed that the caribou afterlife is guarded by giant wolves that kill careless hunters who venture too near. The Netsilik Inuit and Takanaluk-arnaluk believed that the sea-woman Nuliayuk's home was guarded by wolves. Wolves were feared by the Tsilhqot'in, who believed that contact with wolves would result in nervous illness or death. The Dena’ina believed wolves were once men, and viewed them as brothers.|$|E
25|$|Summaries of Jean's {{time as the}} Queen's {{representative}} emerged by mid-2010; Jean {{was regarded}} as having fulfilled the role in an admirable, though not perfect, fashion. It was noted that she used the office, her speaking abilities, and photogenic nature to Canada's advantage, promoting freedom, human rights, and urban youth, and to bring attention to socio-economic problems in the country's north. She was commended for her dedication to the arts, <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>Canadians,</b> the Armed Forces, and her outreach to Haiti following the earthquake there, but critiqued for specific incidents, such as referring to herself as Canada's head of state and making public comments that skirted the political. Her ability to personally connect with those she met was also noted, {{as well as her}} frequent displays of emotion; commentators dubbed her the empathizer-in-chief.|$|E

25|$|Jean was {{a refugee}} from Haiti—coming to Canada in 1968—and {{was raised in}} the town of Thetford Mines, Quebec. After {{receiving}} a number of university degrees, Jean worked as a journalist and broadcaster for Radio-Canada and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), as well as undertaking charity work, mostly in the field of assisting victims of domestic violence. In 2005, she was appointed governor general by Queen Elizabeth II, on the recommendation of Prime Minister Paul Martin, to replace Adrienne Clarkson as vicereine and she occupied the post until succeeded by David Johnston in 2010. Early in her tenure, comments of hers recorded in some of the film works by her husband, Jean-Daniel Lafond, were construed as supporting Quebec sovereignty and her holding of dual citizenship caused doubt about her loyalties. But Jean denied separatist leanings, renounced her citizenship of France, and eventually became a respected vicereine noted for her attention to the Canadian Forces, <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>Canadians,</b> and the arts, especially youth involvement in them. Jean is also currently the Special Envoy for Haiti for the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization and Chancellor of the University of Ottawa.|$|E
25|$|In {{the prelude}} to the patriation of the Canadian {{constitution}} in 1982, some First Nations leaders campaigned for and some against the proposed move, many asserting that the federal ministers of the Crown {{had no right to}} advise the Queen that she sever, without consent from the First Nations, the treaty rights she and her ancestors had long granted to <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>Canadians.</b> Worrying to them was the fact that their relationship with the monarch had, over the preceding century, come to be interpreted by Indian Affairs officials as one of subordination to the government—a misreading on the part of non-Aboriginals of the terms Great White Mother and her Indian Children. Indeed, First Nations representatives were locked out of constitutional conferences in the late 1970s, leading the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB) to make plans to petition the Queen directly. The Liberal Cabinet at the time, not wishing to be embarrassed by having the monarch intervene, extended to the NIB an invitation to talks at the ministerial level, though not the first ministers' meetings. But the invite came just before the election in May 1979, which put the Progressive Conservative Party into Cabinet and the new ministers of the Crown decided to advise the Queen not to meet with the NIB delegation, while telling the NIB that the Queen had no power. The ministers of the Crown eventually reversed their position and offered a similar invitation to constitutional talks, but the NIB party, consisting of over 200 people, had already departed for London.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{laws and}} {{policies}} that encouraged or required Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a Eurocentric society, [...] Canada violated the United Nations Genocide Convention that Canada signed in 1949 and passed through Parliament in 1952. The residential school system that removed Aboriginal children from their homes has led scholars to believe that Canada can be tried in international court for genocide. A legal case resulted in settlement of 2 billion C$ in 2006 {{and the establishment of}} a Truth and Reconciliation Commission which confirmed the injurious effect on children of this system and turmoil created between <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>Canadians</b> and Canadian Society.|$|E

500|$|In 1832, Belcourt {{established}} the first native-only mission west of Saint Boniface, but Gros Ventre raids forced its closure the following year. In 1834, {{he established a}} mission at Baie-Saint-Paul on the Assiniboine River, where he instructed the local Aboriginal population in European-style agriculture. The priest had a log chapel built, with smaller log cabins on the surrounding land to house the natives. [...] The local bishop opposed his missionary work, as he believed the <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>Canadians</b> would not settle in one spot for long. Belcourt overcame this opposition, and in 1834 built a school at his mission, enlisting {{the assistance of a}} Chippewa-speaking woman to serve as a teacher. In 1836, the missionary admitted five natives to Holy Communion. [...] He was discouraged by the Ojibwe readiness to return to their former spiritual practices after baptism.|$|E

2500|$|The St. Lawrence Iroquoians were <b>Aboriginal</b> <b>Canadians</b> who existed {{from the}} 14th century to about 1580 {{concentrated}} along {{the shores of}} the St. Lawrence River in present-day Quebec and Ontario, Canada, as well as the American state of New York, although their territory extended east. [...] They spoke Laurentian languages, a branch of the Iroquoian family. [...] They were believed to have numbered up to 120,000 people in 25 nations. However, this much higher estimate of the number Lawrence Iroquoians is disputed. The traditional view is that they disappeared because of late 16th century warfare by the Mohawk nation of the Haudenosaunee, who wanted to control fur trade in the valley. But other possibilities, including climate change, wars with various Algonquin tribes and exposure to European diseases, may have been equally important.|$|E
