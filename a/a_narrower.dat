5|$|Classifications {{published}} {{since the}} use of molecular phylogenetics have taken <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> view of the Liliaceae (s.s.). In 1998, Tamura considered Calochortus sufficiently distinct to elevate the subfamily Calochortoideae to family status as Calochortaceae, resulting in the term Liliaceae sensu Tamura to indicate Liliaceae without the Calochortoideae. In 2009, Takhtajan used an even narrower definition (see Table 2 & Table 3 below).|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae s.l., many {{attempts have been made to}} form suprageneric classifications, e.g. subfamilies and tribes. Classifications published since the use of molecular methods in phylogenetics have taken <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> view of the Liliaceae (Liliaceae s.s.). The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website (APweb) recognizes three subfamilies, one of which is divided into two tribes.|$|E

The boundary had originally been proposed by Johnson the previous year, but covering <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> area.|$|E
5|$|The bat is a hitting tool, {{traditionally}} {{made of a}} single, solid {{piece of}} wood. Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games. It is a hard round stick, about 2.5inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> handle and culminating in a knob. Bats used by adults are typically around 34inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42inches (106 centimeters).|$|E

5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} {{occurring}} between noon and evening. The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm, but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins, {{for which there is}} no standard definition. However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of noon was defined—and so afternoon would have referred to <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> timeframe.|$|E
5|$|Black adopted <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> {{interpretation}} of the Fourth Amendment than {{many of his colleagues}} on the Warren Court. He dissented from Katz v. United States (1967), in which the Court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. He argued that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that telephone conversations were not within the scope of the amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are easily}} {{distinguished}} from males {{as they have}} <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller cere and nostrils, more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not {{very different from that}} of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. They tend to resist more and be more aggressive than the male when handled. Nesting females also have a brood patch on the bare skin of the belly.|$|E

5000|$|In geography, a defile is <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> pass or gorge between {{mountains}} or hills. It has {{its origins}} {{as a military}} description of a pass through which troops can march only in <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> column or with <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> front. On emerging from a defile (or something similar) into open country, soldiers are said to [...] "debouch".|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>narrows</b> may form where {{a stream}} {{passes through a}} tilted bed of hard rock lying between two softer beds: [...] "if the hard beds are vertical, so that their outcrop does not shift as erosion proceeds, <b>a</b> <b>narrows</b> is developed". Like a dam, this [...] "raises the water level for a short {{distance}} upriver". <b>A</b> <b>narrows</b> is also typically a good location for trapping migrating fish. Furthermore, <b>a</b> <b>narrows</b> is [...] "an important topographical feature for wind mixing", an effect where a wind chill may form ice while the surrounding temperature remains above freezing.|$|R
5|$|Originally, the weight-reduction phase had {{included}} removing the anchors from the battleship, but Wallin ordered {{one of the}} anchors to be reattached. His reason for doing so was that the anchor would effectively shift Missouris center of gravity forward to <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> part of the battleship, thereby reducing the friction at her widest point. During this time, the Bureau of Ships offered valuable technical and salvage advice to both the civilian and military participants in the salvage effort.|$|E
5|$|The SECR Kclass was {{a type of}} 2-6-4 tank {{locomotive}} {{designed in}} 1914 by Richard Maunsell for express passenger duties on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), which operated between London and south-east England. The Southern Railway (SR) K1class was a three-cylinder variant of the Kclass, designed in 1925 to suit <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> loading gauge. They {{were among the first}} non-Great Western Railway (GWR) types to use and improve upon the basic design principles of power and standardisation established by GWR Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) George Jackson Churchward. The locomotives were based on the GWR 4300class, improved by the Midland Railway's ideals of simplicity and ease of maintenance.|$|E
5|$|The adult female {{is mainly}} {{scalloped}} and mottled in light brown {{with a more}} uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male's; it is still easily identified by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake pintail looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown speculum with <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> trailing edge.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 5.7-7.5 mm. The forewings of {{the females}} are dark brown with <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> white band on the dorsum from the base to 1/4 of the entire length, medially with <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> white band extending from the costa to the dorsum and with <b>a</b> pair of <b>narrow</b> white bands beginning at the costal and dorsal margin near 2/3 of the wing and extending obliquely toward the wing apex, terminating before reaching mid-width of the wing. There is <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> silver band with metallic reflection extending from the costa to the dorsum at 5/6 length and the distal 1/6 is brown with a black dot centrally. The distal end is fringed with <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> white band and terminating with <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> black band. The hindwings {{of the females}} are dark brown. The forewings of the males are brown with <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> white band on the dorsum from the base to 2/3 of the entire length and with three pairs of narrow white bands beginning at the costal and dorsal margin near 1/2 to 3/4 length of the wing and extending obliquely toward the wing apex, terminating before reaching mid-width of the wing. There is <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> silver band with metallic reflection extending from the costa to the dorsum at 5/6 length and the distal 1/6 is orange-brown with a black dot centrally, franked by a short white band near the dorsum. The distal end is fringed with <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> white band and terminating with <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> brown band. The hindwings of the males are brown.|$|R

5|$|The female Bohemian waxwing is {{very similar}} to the male, but has <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> yellow {{terminal}} band to the tail, a less defined lower edge to the black throat and slightly less distinctive wing markings. Juveniles are duller than adults, with whiter underparts, only a few red wing tips, no black on the throat and a smaller black face mask. Compared to the nominate subspecies, eastern B. g. centralasiae is paler, greyer and has little reddish-brown behind the bill. The American subspecies B. g. pallidiceps has more colouring on the cheeks and forehead than the nominate form and is otherwise generally duller in appearance.|$|E
5|$|The female has, on average, <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> black back band, {{slightly}} duller upperparts and buffer underparts {{than the}} male. Her cap may be gray, but many females have black caps and cannot be reliably {{distinguished from the}} male in the field. In the northeastern United States, at least 10% of females have black caps, but the proportion rises to 40–80% in the Rocky Mountains, Mexico and the southeastern U.S. Juveniles {{are similar to the}} adult, but duller plumaged.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} characteristic of Pteranodon is its cranial crest. These crests consisted of skull bones (frontals) projecting upward and backward from the skull. The {{size and shape}} of these crests varied due to a number of factors, including age, sex, and species. Male Pteranodon sternbergi, the older species of the two described to date (and sometimes placed in the distinct genus Geosternbergia), had a more vertical crest with a broad forward projection, while their descendants, Pteranodon longiceps, evolved <b>a</b> <b>narrower,</b> more backward-projecting crest. Females of both species were smaller and bore small, rounded crests. The crests were probably mainly display structures, though they may have had other functions as well.|$|E

5|$|The serval {{is similar}} to the {{sympatric}} caracal, but has <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> spoor, a rounder skull, and lacks its prominent ear tufts. The African golden cat is darker, with different cranial features. It resembles the cheetah in its build and coat pattern, though not in size. The serval shares its adaptations to its marshy habitat with the jungle cat; both cats have large and sharp ears that help in locating the prey efficiently, and their long legs raise them above muddy ground and water.|$|E
5|$|There are two modern breeds of cocker spaniel, the English Cocker Spaniel and the American Cocker Spaniel. They were bred as gun dogs; to {{use their}} sense of smell to cover low areas near the handler in order to flush birds into the air to be shot, and {{to use their}} eyes and nose to locate the bird once downed, and then to {{retrieve}} the bird with a soft mouth. The major differences between the English and American varieties is that the American is smaller with a shorter back, a domed head and a shorter muzzle, while the English variety is taller with <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> head and chest.|$|E
5|$|This work {{excludes}} {{elements of}} several dreamings associated with country further south, {{which had been}} included in the painting created by Clifford Possum and his brother a year earlier. The omission led scholar Vivien Johnson to conclude that Warlugulong (1977) portrays <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> geographic area than the preceding work. The artist also modified some of the iconography, and limited the explanations of the painting, omitting secret-sacred dimensions of the stories to avoid offending other Indigenous men, and in recognition that most of the audience for the work would be uninitiated non-Indigenous people.|$|E
