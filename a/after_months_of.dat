40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} baseline {{demographic and}} clinical risk {{factors associated with}} poor CD 4 and weight response after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected children in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 674 children initiating antiretroviral therapy at McCord and St. Mary’s hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, from August 2003 to December 2008. We extracted data from paper charts and electronic medical records to assess risk factors associated with CD 4 and weight response using logistic regression. Results: From the initial cohort of 901 children, 10 years old initiating ART between August 2003 and December 2008, we analyzed 674 children with complete baseline data. Viral suppression rates (, 400 copies/ml) were 84 % <b>after</b> six <b>months</b> <b>of</b> therapy and 88 % <b>after</b> 12 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> therapy. Seventy-three percent of children achieved CD 4 recovery <b>after</b> six <b>months</b> and 89 % <b>after</b> 12 <b>months.</b> Weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ) improvements were seen in 58 % <b>of</b> children <b>after</b> six <b>months</b> <b>of</b> ART and 64 % <b>after</b> 12 <b>months.</b> <b>After</b> six <b>months</b> <b>of</b> ART, lower baseline hemoglobin (p = 0. 037), presence of chronic diarrhea (p = 0. 007), and virologic failure (p = 0. 046) were all associated with poor CD 4 recovery by multivariate logistic regression. <b>After</b> 12 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> ART, poor CD 4 recovery was associated with higher baseline CD 4 % (p = 0. 005), chronic diarrhe...|$|R
