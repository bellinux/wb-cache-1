5|$|The {{state laws}} {{governing}} <b>alcoholic</b> beverages in New Jersey {{are among the}} most complex in the United States, with many peculiarities not found in other states' laws. They provide for 29 distinct liquor licenses granted to manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and for the public warehousing and transport of <b>alcoholic</b> beverages. General authority for the statutory and regulatory control of <b>alcoholic</b> beverages rests with the state government, particularly the Division of <b>Alcoholic</b> Beverage Control overseen by the state's Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1738, {{towns in}} New Jersey began issuing liquor {{licenses}} to tavern keepers. Before federal Prohibition in 1919, despite many state liquor statutes, {{the regulation of}} <b>alcoholic</b> beverages in New Jersey was almost exclusively local, with wide variations among municipalities. In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, the states were again permitted to regulate <b>alcoholic</b> beverages. Immediately upon the end of Prohibition in 1933, New Jersey instituted the <b>Alcoholic</b> Beverage Control Law, which established and granted rulemaking powers to the Division of <b>Alcoholic</b> Beverage Control. The law also established a three-tier alcohol distribution system whereby, with minor exceptions, alcohol manufacturers may only sell to wholesalers, who may only sell to retailers, who may only sell to customers.|$|E

A person only needs to be 18 to own a liquor license, or to sell or serve alcohol (for example, a waiter or supermarket cashier). State law also prohibits an underage person from misrepresenting their age in a licensed establishment.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Excessive alcohol {{consumption}} {{often results in}} intestinal damage, mediated by inflammatory processes, mainly characterized by an increased influx of leukocytes. Fecal calprotectin is a granulocyte cytosolic protein, representing as a promising marker of subclinical intestinal inflammation. In this study, we assessed fecal calprotectin concentrations (FCCs) in current drinking <b>alcoholics,</b> both at the baseline, and then during a subsequent 84 -day period. Moreover, FCCs in the <b>alcoholics</b> were compared with the FCCs in healthy controls. METHODS: Twenty-eight, active-drinking <b>alcoholics</b> were enrolled {{in this study and}} compared with 40 healthy volunteers as the control group. In <b>alcoholics,</b> FCCs were determined {{at the beginning of the}} study (baseline; T 0) and then every 2 weeks (T 1 -T 6) during the following 84 -day period. Potential differences in FCCs were analyzed between <b>alcoholics</b> and healthy controls, and during the 84 -day period within the group of <b>alcoholics.</b> In addition, an analysis of FCCs was conducted in three subgroups of <b>alcoholics,</b> considering their drinking status during the 84 -day period (abstinent, relapsed, and active). RESULTS: At baseline, no significant differences in median FCCs were found between <b>alcoholics</b> and controls. No significant changes of median FCCs were found, comparing baseline FCCs and FCCs during the 84 -day period (T 1 -T 6) in the whole group of <b>alcoholics,</b> nor in the three subgroups of <b>alcoholics.</b> CONCLUSION: FCCs in active-drinking <b>alcoholics</b> are not significantly different, compared with the healthy controls. Moreover, FCCs do not significantly differ according to the alcohol drinking status. These results may suggest the absence of a subclinal intestinal inflammation involving neutrophils in the <b>alcoholics...</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Alcoholic</b> {{beverage}} and {{the process}} of fermentation: The earliest archaeological evidence of fermentation and the consumption of <b>alcoholic</b> beverages was discovered in neolithic China dating from 7000–6600 BC.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was {{to examine the relationship between}} adult children of <b>alcoholics</b> and neurotic perfectionism. Neurotic perfectionism was determined by examining five different areas of the Almost Perfect Scale- Revised which are Standards and Order, Discrepancy, Relationships, Procrastination, and Anxiety. One hundred and nineteen students enrolled in the general psychology course at the university chosen participated in this study. Of the total participants, nineteen were identified as adult children of <b>alcoholics</b> by their scores on the Children of <b>Alcoholics</b> Screening Test (CAST). Adult children of <b>alcoholics</b> were identified as those individuals scoring a 6 orii higher on the Children of <b>Alcoholics</b> Screening Test (CAST). Participants were administered the Children of <b>Alcoholics</b> Screening Test (CAST), the Almost Perfect Scale – Revised (APS-R), and a Demographic Questionnaire. Based on the results of the study, adult children of <b>alcoholics</b> tend to have higher perfectionism levels on the Discrepancy scale than adult children of non-alcoholics. There appears to be no significant correlation between adult children of <b>alcoholics</b> and perfectionism in the areas of Standards and Orders, Procrastination, Anxiety, and Relationships.

United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express will ship wine to a person's home, but will only deliver beer or hard liquor to a licensed business. Although uncommon, it is legal for a liquor store to deliver <b>alcoholic</b> beverages by car or van to a person's home.

50|$|Recent {{technology}} has allowed researchers to measure cortisol levels in human hair (showing cumulative cortisol exposure over {{extended periods of}} time). This method of measurement {{has been used to}} compare long-term cortisol levels in <b>alcoholics,</b> abstinent <b>alcoholics,</b> and non-alcoholics. One recent study revealed that <b>alcoholics</b> had three to four times higher hair cortisol concentrations than abstinent <b>alcoholics</b> or non-alcoholics (consistent with previous research showing periods of alcohol consumption are associated with heightened cortisol levels). Abstinent <b>alcoholics</b> and non-alcoholics had the same low levels of cortisol, suggesting that cortisol levels eventually return to normal after extended cessation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveAlcoholism {{has been}} {{associated}} with a widespread pattern of gray matter atrophy. This study sought to investigate the spectrum of volume alterations in a population of <b>alcoholics</b> with only alcohol dependence, polysubstance abusing <b>alcoholics,</b> and a comparison population of healthy controls. MethodThirty-seven ‘pure’ <b>alcoholics,</b> 93 polysubstance abusing <b>alcoholics,</b> and 69 healthy controls underwent structural T 1 MRI scans. Voxel-based morphometry was performed to investigate gray matter alterations. ResultsAlcoholic dependent inpatients (both with and without a history of DSM-IV substance abuse/dependence diagnosis) displayed significant gray matter differences in the mesial region of the frontal lobe and right temporal lobe. ‘Pure’ <b>alcoholics</b> exhibited a pattern of subcortical changes similar to that seen in Wernicke–Korsakoff Syndrome when compared to polysubstance abusing <b>alcoholics.</b> ‘Pure’ <b>alcoholics</b> and polysubstance abusing <b>alcoholics</b> did not differ significantly in measures of cortical gray matter, liver function, or nutrition. ConclusionsThese findings reinforce the accepted literature in regards to frontal lobe gray matter atrophy in alcohol dependence. This study calls for additional research in order to investigate the spectrum from uncomplicated alcoholism to Wernicke–Korsakoff Syndrome. Further research is needed to elucidate the exact cause of this pattern of differences and to determine what factors are responsible for the patterns of gray matter reduction or difference in ‘pure’ and polysubstance abusing <b>alcoholics...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Autopsy and neuroimaging {{research}} in stably abstinent <b>alcoholics</b> illuminated structural and functional abnormalities in brain areas that organize and coordinate motor functioning. Researchers that used behavioural tasks to measure motor functioning found that abstinent <b>alcoholics</b> perform worse than healthy controls. These researchers however did not analyze timed responses into their cognitive and motor components. They thus {{were unable to}} decide which aspects of information processing are impaired. We here used a Fitts' task to examine differences in cognitive and motor components between abstinent <b>alcoholics</b> and healthy controls. Methods: Fifty-two abstinent <b>alcoholics</b> and 52 healthy controls participated in this research design. Fine motor functioning was assessed {{by means of the}} Fitts' task. Results: Abstinent <b>alcoholics</b> needed more time to perform timed responses than healthy controls. As both reaction and movement times were higher in abstinent <b>alcoholics,</b> both cognitive and motor processes seem to be impaired. When the task became more difficult (small targets instead of large targets) abstinent <b>alcoholics</b> needed proportionally more time to give the correct response than healthy controls. This phenomenon solely applied to movement times. Conclusions: These research data indicate that abstinent <b>alcoholics</b> are somewhat impaired on a behavioral level. The execution of timed responses indeed was lengthier in abstinent <b>alcoholics</b> than in healthy controls. As both cognitive and motor processes were impaired, we here assume that both central and peripheral processes are affected by progressive alcohol intake. Abstinent <b>alcoholics</b> also have more difficulties to adapt their motor responses to changing task conditions...|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{alcoholism}} {{is known}} to disrupt functions served by distributed brain systems, including limbic and frontocerebellar circuits involved in resting-state and task-activated networks subserving component processes of memory often affected in <b>alcoholics.</b> Using an fMRI paradigm, we investigated whether memory performance by <b>alcoholics</b> on a face-name association test previously observed to be problematic for <b>alcoholics</b> {{could be explained by}} desynchronous activity between nodes of these specific networks. While in the scanner, 18 <b>alcoholics</b> and 15 controls performed a face-name associative learning task with different levels of processing at encoding.

40|$|Abstract — Aims: To {{assess the}} role of smoking on {{treatment}} outcome in quitting <b>alcoholics</b> on {{the background of the}} priming or coping hypothesis (Rohsenow et al., 1997). Methods: Data sets of placebo treated patients of the German phase III trial of naltrexone (Gastpar et al., 2002) and of acamprosate treated patients of a German phase IV trial (Soyka et al., 2002) were reanalyzed. Differences between smoking and non-smoking <b>alcoholics</b> were evaluated using χ 2 -, t- or ANOVA-tests, relapse rates using survival techniques with Cox regression. Results: Smoking <b>alcoholics</b> differed significantly from non-smoking <b>alcoholics</b> regarding sociodemographic variables (e. g. more males, more often living alone) and severity indicators of alcoholism (e. g. quantity, onset, related problems). In the naltrexone study time to first relapse was significantly longer for smoking <b>alcoholics</b> compared to non-smoking <b>alcoholics</b> (hazard ratio = 2. 26; P = 0. 036). The same effect was seen in the acamprosate study (hazard ratio = 1. 34; P = 0. 015); estimated abstinencerates after 24 weeks were 38 % for smoking <b>alcoholics</b> compared to 28 % for non-smoking <b>alcoholics</b> (P < 0. 015). Conclusions: Smoking was significantly associated with better outcome in recovering <b>alcoholics</b> included in two pharmacotherapy trials.

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundTotal serum IgE may be {{increased}} in <b>alcoholics.</b> IgE synthesis depends on B cell activation by Th 2 -type cytokines. Serum sCD 30 has been proposed as a marker of Th 2 responses. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate serum sCD 30 levels in <b>alcoholics</b> and their relationship with serum IgE values. MethodsTwenty-five active <b>alcoholics</b> and 18 healthy controls were included in the study. All subjects were non-atopic (asymptomatic from the allergologic point of view and Phadiatop® (Phamacia & Upjohn Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden) negative). Serum IgE was measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay and serum sCD 30 was assayed by ELISA. ResultsTotal serum IgE was higher in <b>alcoholics</b> than in controls (median (range) for <b>alcoholics</b> and controls 59 (15. 8 - 236) vs 24 (4 - 103) IU/mL, respectively; P = 0. 003). Conversely, median serum sCD 30 levels were lower in <b>alcoholics</b> than in controls (< 1 (< 1 - 144) vs 7. 3 (< 1 - 83) U/mL, respectively; P = 0. 02). Among the <b>alcoholics,</b> a negative correlation between serum IgE and sCD 30 values was observed. ConclusionsIncreased serum IgE in non-atopic <b>alcoholics</b> is associated with low serum sCD 30 concentrations.
