5|$|The Drapier's fourth letter, To the Whole People of Ireland, <b>A</b> <b>Word</b> <b>or</b> <b>Two</b> to the People of Ireland, A Short Defense of the People of Ireland, {{was written}} on 13 October 1724 and was either {{published}} on 21 October 1724 or on 22 October 1724, the day Lord Carteret arrived in Dublin. Throughout the letter, the Drapier pretends that Carteret's transfer to Ireland to enforce Wood's patent was a rumour produced by Wood's allies, although Swift had knowledge to the contrary.|$|E

He returned to the stage at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in August 2008 in a critically acclaimed performance as Julius Caesar in George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra directed by Tony winner Des McAnuff; this production was videotaped and shown in high-definition in Canadian cinemas on January 31, 2009 (with an encore presentation on February 23, 2009) and broadcast on April 4, 2009 on Bravo! in Canada. Plummer returned to the Stratford Festival {{in the summer of}} 2010 in The Tempest as the lead character, Prospero (also videotaped and shown in high-def in cinemas), and again in the summer of 2012 in the one-man show, <b>A</b> <b>Word</b> <b>or</b> <b>Two,</b> an autobiographical exploration of his love of literature. In 2014, Plummer presented <b>A</b> <b>Word</b> <b>or</b> <b>Two</b> again, at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conversation}} was carried on for around two hours using no battery power {{at all and}} working solely with the current induced by the aurora, and {{it was said that}} {{this was the first time}} on record that more than <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> was transmitted in such manner.

2500|$|The song's message {{recalls that}} of Dylan's September 1965 single [...] "Positively 4th Street", as Harrison {{appears to be}} ending a relationship, {{possibly}} with a lover. The lyrics adopt an accusatory stance from the opening line: [...] "I've got <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> {{to say about the}} things that you do." [...] Author Ian Inglis describes the song as [...] "a withering attack" [...] in which [...] "Harrison's blunt 'I left you far behind' and Dylan's curt 'It's not my problem' [...] could be spoken by the same voice." [...] Harrison also incorporates Dylan-esque surrealism in his reference to [...] "opaque" [...] minds and in the line [...] "the good things that we can have if we close our eyes".|$|E
2500|$|New York Times {{art critic}} John Russell wrote…Fekner {{is an artist}} who works not only in New York but with New York. The city in its more disinherited aspects is the raw {{material}} with {{which he has been}} working ever since he got a studio space in P.S. 1 in Long Island City in 1976 and learned to regard the huge dilapidated building as [...] "an elderly person who has acutely perceived his experience of life." [...] He went on to work outdoors in Queens and in the Bronx in ways that gave point and urgency to places long sunk in despair. With <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> (Decay, for instance, or Broken Promises), he brought an element of street theater into disaster areas. With a single stenciled phrase (Wheels Over Indian Trails, for instance) he mingled present with past {{on the side of the}} Pulaski Bridge near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. What in other hands might have been vandalism had a salutary effect. People in desolate parts of the city saw more, felt more, thought more and came out of their apathy.|$|E
