5|$|Magnetic fields {{have been}} {{detected}} in the space <b>around</b> <b>just</b> about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, generating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10μG. The Davis–Greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical polarization. This {{has been used to}} show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources {{have been detected}} even among the most distant, high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.|$|E

25|$|Result: Platinum {{ended up}} with an {{umbrella}} that doubled up as a seat, and a cardboard toilet. Odyssey also wanted the toilet, but lost out due to Steven and Lucy spending their entire pitch haggling on the price and showing no real enthusiasm for the product. They therefore {{ended up with}} novelty onesies and a pedal-powered washing machine. The teams found all their products hard to sell, in particular Odyssey, who ended up failing to sell a single washing machine. Platinum ultimately edged Odyssey in the final figures, winning by <b>around</b> <b>just</b> £30.|$|E
25|$|Notice that {{to send a}} {{laser pulse}} toward the {{stationary}} observer S at R = 0, the Langevin observer L has to aim slightly behind to correct for its own motion. Turning things <b>around,</b> <b>just</b> as a duck hunter would expect, to send a laser pulse toward the Langevin observer riding a counterclockwise rotating ring, the central observer has to aim, not at this observer's current position, but at the position at which he will arrive {{just in time to}} intercept the signal. These families of inward and outward bound radial null geodesics represent very different curves in spacetime and their projections do not agree for ω > 0.|$|E
25|$|In astronomy, Lagrangian {{points are}} five {{positions}} in the orbital plane of two large orbiting bodies where a small object affected only by gravity can maintain a stable position relative to the two large bodies. The first three Lagrangian points (L1, L2, L3) lie along the line connecting the two large bodies, while the last two points (L4 and L5) each form an equilateral triangle with the two large bodies. The L4 and L5 points, although they correspond to maxima of the effective potential in the coordinate frame that rotates with the two large bodies, are stable due to the Coriolis effect. The stability can result in orbits <b>around</b> <b>just</b> L4 or L5, known as Tadpole orbits, where trojans can be found. It can also result in orbits that encircle L3, L4, and L5, known as horseshoe orbits.|$|E

25|$|These {{mangroves}} {{are important}} nursery grounds {{for nearly all}} major angling fish including yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis), flat-tail sea-mullet (Liza argentea), luderick (Girella tricuspidata) and sand whiting (Sillago ciliata) which are caught in adjoining waters as adults, mangroves also provide rich organic matter to the Port Hacking Estuary by fixing carbon into the river system through the addition of leaves into the thick rich black mud. Many crustacean and mollusc species rely on mangroves {{as a source of}} food whether by providing foraging through leaf litter, mud or direct predation of the mangrove trees and seeds. Soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus), semaphore crab (Heloecius cordiformis), blue swimmer crabs (Portunus pelagicus) and hermit crabs (Pagurus sinuatus) also call the mangroves home. A more casual visitor to the mangroves at high tide is the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis) which scoots <b>around</b> <b>just</b> an inch from the surface and is virtually invisible unless viewed through a snorkel.|$|E
25|$|The wounded Emery {{suggests}} that Annie {{be killed in}} order to allow everyone to escape, alarming the rest of the group. While in the kitchen, Cathy Kramer is attacked by Mrs. Waterman and is rescued by Nick. The two decide to tie up the deranged woman and leave her in the kitchen. They agree not to inform Emery so that the unstable young man does not become more unbalanced. A ghostly Sukeena appears and drags Mrs. Waterman off into the dark wine cellar. As Nick and Cathy head back toward the main hall, the house changes around them and they become lost. A mysterious shape under the carpet chases them, and they flee. The shape begins to catch up to them, and Nick shoves Cathy into a room and slams the door behind her, turning <b>around</b> <b>just</b> in time to see a skeletal monster rushing up to him. With silence in the hallway, Cathy opens the door again but finds no sign of Nick or the entity in the empty hallway. As the house continues to change around her, Cathy ends up in the attic. Suddenly overcome by the urge to automatically write, she witnesses the murder of John Rimbauer by Ellen and Sukeena. Steve and Rachel, meanwhile, decide to look for Nick and Cathy. They find Cathy in the attic, where she is about to be attacked by a corpse-like creature. Their presence seemingly prevents the house from acting, and the corpse drops lifeless to the floor. The corpse's withered arm lets them deduce that the carcass is that of Steven's missing great-aunt (and Ellen's daughter), April Rimbauer. Suddenly, April's corpse releases a bright white light from its mouth and instantly disintegrates.|$|E

500|$|In 1978, the Red Sox, led by Jim Rice, Carl Yastrzemski, Fred Lynn and catcher Carlton Fisk, {{and managed}} by future Yankee coach Don Zimmer, were looking {{good for the}} World Series (a.k.a. [...] "Fall Classic") {{for the second time}} in the decade. They led the Yankees in the standings by 14 games in mid-July, with less than three months to go in the regular season. The Yankees turned their season <b>around</b> <b>just</b> as the Red Sox seemed to collapse. By September 7, the Yankees had whittled down the 14-game deficit to only four games, just in time for a four-game series at Fenway Park in Boston. The Yankees won all four games in the series by a {{combined}} score of 42–9. This series became known as the [...] "Boston Massacre". On September 16, the Yankees held a -game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 12 of their next 14 games (and their last eight in a row) to overcome that deficit and finish in a first-place tie with the Yankees. A one-game playoff was scheduled in Boston to determine who would win the AL East pennant for 1978.|$|E
500|$|Constructed on a {{territorial}} boundary {{in about}} 600BC, the first hill fort at Maiden Castle was a [...] area {{surrounded by a}} single ditch. The hill it sits on {{is part of a}} ridge {{on the north side of}} the South Winterborne valley, which feeds the River Frome. At the eastern end of the ridge and rising [...] above sea level, the site of the first hill fort was not the highest point along the ridge, although the highest point is the neighbouring Hog Hill and is only [...] higher. The hill projects about [...] above the surrounding countryside which is about [...] above sea level. The defences were [...] high and consisted of the V-shaped ditch and a rampart. The rampart would probably have been timber-faced <b>around</b> <b>just</b> the entrances. Elaborate timber facing would have been used to impress visitors. The site could be accessed by an entrance in the northwest and a double entrance in the east. The double entrance is unique in hill forts in the British Isles. The reason for a double entrance is unclear; however, archaeologist Niall Sharples has suggested that it was a form of segregation. It is likely that several farming communities lived in the hill fort and wanted different entrances.|$|E

In 1156, a revolt began in Sfax and quickly spread and nothing was done to put it down. In 1159, the admiral Peter led a raiding expedition against the Saracen-held Balearic Islands with 160 ships. He tried to relieve besieged Mahdia with the same fleet, but turned <b>around</b> <b>just</b> after engaging in battle.

2500|$|Arab {{immigration}} to the United States began when Arabs accompanied Spanish explorers to the US in the 15th century. During the Revolutionary War, horses exported from Algeria replenished the American cavalry and Morocco was the first country to officially recognize {{the independence of the}} United States in 1787 in {{what is known as the}} [...] "treaty of Friendship". However, Arabs did not start immigrating to the United States in significant numbers until the 19th century. [...] Since the first major wave of Arab immigration in the late 19th century, the majority of Arab immigrants have settled in or near large cities. Roughly 94 percent of all Arab immigrants live in metropolitan areas, and nearly one third of all Arab Americans live in or <b>around</b> <b>just</b> three cities: New York, Los Angeles and Detroit. While most Arab-Americans have similarly settled in just a handful of major American cities, they form a fairly diverse population representing nearly every country and religion from the Arab world.|$|E
