5|$|After the Hollywood {{theme was}} decided on, the design team drew up <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>and</b> {{assigned}} objects and puzzles to different areas. The game was originally {{designed for the}} ZX Spectrum and then ported to the Amstrad CPC, due to the systems' similar architecture. However, the team struggled to port the game to the Commodore 64 due to it being a different machine altogether. The finished game is significantly changed from the incomplete Movieland Dizzy, which featured only film sets as locations, the surrounding film studio and backlots were not present. The real-world studio elements were added after Dizzy was disassociated from the game.|$|E
5|$|As in its predecessor, System Shock, {{gameplay}} in System Shock 2 is an amalgamation of {{the action}} role-playing game and survival horror genres. The developers achieved this gameplay design by rendering the experience as a standard first-person shooter and adding a character customization and development system, which are considered as signature role-play elements. The player uses melee and projectile weapons to defeat enemies, while a role-playing system allows the development of useful abilities. Navigation is presented from a first-person view and complemented with a heads-up display that shows character and weapon information, <b>a</b> <b>map,</b> <b>and</b> a drag and drop inventory.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} November 1994 by the lead programmer, Simon Carter, and took {{two and a}} half years to develop. The game used the engine for Magic Carpet, and the first version was merely {{scrolling}} around <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>and</b> entering third-person. The engine was built by Glenn Corpes. Molyneux then developed a 2D prototype containing features that made it into the final game. The prototype focused on constructing the dungeon, and included the Treasure room, Hatchery, Training room, and Dungeon Heart. The characters were designed by the artist, Mark Healey.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 and 2007, a {{team from}} the University of West Bohemia, {{together}} with Salahaddin University in Arbil, carried out an extensive survey and evaluation of the entire citadel. As part of this project, geodetic measurements of the citadel were taken and these were combined with satellite imagery, regular photographic imagery and aerial photographs to create <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>and</b> digital 3D model of the citadel mound and the houses on top of it. Geophysical prospection {{was carried out in}} some areas of the citadel to detect traces of older architecture buried under the present houses. Archaeological investigations included an archaeological survey on the western slope of the citadel mound, and the excavation of a small test trench {{in the eastern part of}} the citadel.|$|E
5|$|Knott's {{most notable}} {{action as a}} {{legislator}} occurred {{near the end of}} his first stint in Congress. On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing a bill that would have provided fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion. In the speech, Knott singled out the Bayfield and St. Croix Railroad's proposed line from the St. Croix River to Duluth, Minnesota to make his point. He derided the remoteness of the town and the need for a railroad to it by repeatedly referring to <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>and</b> asking where Duluth was located. Following the speech, the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day.|$|E
5|$|Mobius Final Fantasy is a {{role-playing}} game {{designed for}} mobile phones. The player controls the game's protagonist Warrior of Light (Wol) while navigating Palamecia. Players can customize settings, graphical quality, and adjust controls for their dominant hand. During local navigation {{on the field}} map, the player taps a location on <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>and</b> the character travels to that location. In some self-contained areas, the player can directly control the character. Along with standard navigation, the player can navigate the game world using a fast-travel system, progressively unlocked as the player progresses through the story. Many of the features in the game, such as the leveling system and exploration, {{are similar to those}} from previous home console Final Fantasy games.|$|E

Two days later, Gwyn issued a report on the Battle of Shepherdstown, noting the efforts he made to rally troops to fight back against the Confederate troops, though his efforts were in vain, as Colonel Barnes ordered to regiment to fall back.|$|E
5|$|One half of Code: Veronica {{places the}} player {{in control of}} Claire Redfield while the other half is spent with her brother, Chris. Basic {{character}} actions include running, attacking, as well as pushing and climbing objects. Items the player collects can be viewed on the status screen. From here, they can be examined to find clues to solve puzzles, and some can also be equipped. Also available in the status screen is <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>and</b> file menu. All notes found in the game are saved in game's files and may be essential to solve puzzles. The player can only hold {{a limited number of}} items at a given time; other items must stored in storage boxes located throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{a remake}} of the {{original}} Jetpac with overhauled high-definition graphics and 128 levels. It also features competitive gameplay over Xbox Live, leaderboards, and achievements. Similar to the first instalment, the player assumes control of Jetman and is presented in a horizontal wrap around which consists of six platforms on which Jetman can manoeuvre onto. Jetman has to first assemble his rocket, which spawns in separate parts that are scattered around <b>a</b> <b>map,</b> <b>and</b> then fills it with six fuel canisters before taking off to the next planet, where the procedure is repeated. In addition, Jetman has to defend himself from each planet's hostile aliens, and collect valuable resources such as gold and platinum, which occasionally fall from the atmosphere, for bonus points.|$|E

5|$|Chatwin went to Australia {{to learn}} more about Aboriginal culture, {{specifically}} the songlines or dreaming tracks. Each songline is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and <b>a</b> <b>map,</b> <b>and</b> each Aboriginal Australian has their own songline. Chatwin thought the songlines could be a metaphor he could use to support his ideas about humans' need to wander, which he believed was genetic. However, he struggled to fully understand and describe the songlines and their place in Aboriginal culture. This was due to Chatwin's approach to learning about the songlines. He spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in Australia, during which he primarily relied on non-Aboriginal people for information. Chatwin was limited by his inability to speak the Aboriginal languages. He interviewed people involved in the Land Rights movement, and he alienated many of them because he was oblivious to the politics and also because he was an admirer of Strehlow's work.|$|E
5|$|FBI Special Agents Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), Terry Lake (Sabrina Lloyd) and David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) {{investigate}} a serial rapist who has begun killing his victims. With the twelfth victim, Karen Silber (Kate Norby), changing her story {{again and the}} thirteenth victim's car missing, Don runs out of viable leads. Taking <b>a</b> <b>map</b> <b>and</b> a case file with him, Don goes to his childhood home, owned by his father Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), to take a shower. Don's younger brother, Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) of CalSci's mathematics department, finds and studies the map which Don lays {{on the dining room}} table. As Don prepares to return to the office, Charlie tries to talk Don into letting him help with the investigation and is inspired by the pattern of drops emanating from the family's sprinkler. He tells Don that he can use a mathematical model to find the neighborhood where the rapist resides. Skeptical, Don agrees to let Charlie assist him in the investigation.|$|E
