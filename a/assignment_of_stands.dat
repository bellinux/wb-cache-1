40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to try to}} provide {{comprehensive}} analysis of the recent legislation of contract for the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a claim, compare it with former legislation, critically evaluate changes that new civil code bought to contract for the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a claim and find solutions for selected legal problems that acceptance of current legislation brought to experts. The thesis is systematically divided into seven chapters. First chapter briefly define the concept of obligation and is dedicated to changes in subject of obligations based on the will of the parties. The second chapter analyses the historical development <b>of</b> <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a claim. In first part attention is paid to genesis of Roman law cessio, in later parts it analysis civil codes effective in Bohemia which contained legislation <b>of</b> <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a claim. The third chapter is devoted to subject <b>of</b> <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a claim. It analysis what can be assign and what cannot be assign. Special attention is dedicated to <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> future claims and <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> group of claims. The fourth chapter is devoted to contract for <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a claim. It analysis form <b>of</b> contract for <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a claim and essential aspects of this kind of contract.

40|$|AbstractWe {{identify}} the concept <b>of</b> a tufted <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> neighbourhoods {{and with it}} strengthen a remarkable theorem of Nagata to have: Every metrizable space has a metric with respect to which balls of equal radii constitute a tufted and symmetric <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> neighbourhoods. We also have: The availability on a T 3 -space of a basic sequence of tufted and symmetric <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> neighbourhoods is (necessary and) sufficient for metrizability. Hausdorff spaces are paracompact {{if and only if}} open covers have refinements in the form of tufted and symmetric <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> neighbourhoods. Moore spaces X are metrizable if (and only if) given any open cover W, there is such a sequence 〈{Un(x) :x∈X}〉 of tufted and symmetric <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> neighbourhoods that, for every x∈X, Un(x) ⊂St(x,W) for some n.

40|$|Raising finance by the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> {{receivables}} is {{an important}} financing technique and its regulation varies under different legal systems. The UNCITRAL Convention on the <b>Assignment</b> <b>of</b> Receivables in International Trade (“the UNCITRAL Convention”) was adopted in 2001 by the General Assembly. The UNCITRAL Convention was prepared to establish a sophisticated, comprehensive and potentially far-reaching model for the modernisation <b>of</b> domestic <b>assignment</b> laws <b>of</b> countries and a substantive step for harmonisation of the law <b>of</b> <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> receivables in international trade. The UNCITRAL Convention not only affects assignment transactions but also securitisation and project financing. The key objective of the UNCITRAL Convention is to facilitate the cross-border flow of credit and to {{lower the cost of}} credit through harmonisation of rules that govern assignments which will lead to greater predictability and certainty in the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> receivables contracts. This article deals only with the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> future receivables. In this connection, formal validity <b>of</b> <b>assignments</b> and the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> future receivables under Turkish law and the UNCITRAL Convention is discussed. In that context certain observations and suggestions are made as to the feasibility and usefulness of ratification of the UNCITRAL Convention...|$|R

40|$|A {{general-purpose}} Monte Carlo assignment {{program has}} been developed {{to aid in the}} <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> NMR resonances from proteins. By virtue of its flexible data requirements the program is capable <b>of</b> obtaining <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> both heavily deuterated and fully protonated proteins. A wide variety of source data, such as inter-residue scalar connectivity, inter-residue dipolar (NOE) connectivity, and residue specific information, can be utilized in the assignment process. The program can also use known assignments from one form of a protein to facilitate the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> another form of the protein. This attribute is useful for assigning protein-ligand complexes when the <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> the unliganded protein are known. The program can be also be used as an interactive research tool to assist in the choice of additional experimental data to facilitate completion <b>of</b> <b>assignments.</b> The <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a deuterated 45 kDa homodimeric Glutathione-S-transferase illustrates the principal features of the program...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{problems}} {{arising from the}} use <b>of</b> the absolute <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> rents in mortgage loan transactions, which have continued for over a century, as well as possible solutions. Rents are {{a significant part of}} the security for loans secured by income-producing properties such as office buildings, shopping centers, and apartments. Under present law in many states, the absolute <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> rents is the only means by which lenders can create an effective security interest in rents of mortgaged property. An absolute <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> rents purports to transfer title to rents to the mortgage lender although in substance it creates a security interest in rents. The Article explores the historical development <b>of</b> the absolute <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> rents and discusses the confusion, unnecessary litigation, and even injustice that it causes under state law and in bankruptcy. The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws has recently approved the new Uniform <b>Assignment</b> <b>of</b> Rents Act, which removes the necessity for absolute <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> rents by creating a workable and comprehensive scheme for the creation of security interests in rents. The Article concludes by discussing the Act and recommending its adoption...|$|R

I have chosen this theme because the Czech legal theory doesn't offer satisfactory answers to all of the questions that arise from this topic. The thesis seeks to analyse the selected issues and to offer reasonable solutions to the problems relating to the selected issues. The method of the thesis is based on a comprehensive analysis of the relevant Czech case law as well as the relevant literature. The realized legal conclusions are afterwards put into a broader context and critically evaluated. The thesis is composed of ten chapters. Chapter One defines aims of the thesis. Chapter Two is introductory and explains the basic concept <b>of</b> the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a receivable under the Czech commercial law. Chapter Three contains a basic overview of the receivables which are generally assignable under the Czech commercial law including the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> future receivables.
