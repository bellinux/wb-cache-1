40|$|A filter {{structure}} is proposed {{which has a}} significantly lower <b>signal</b> <b>delay</b> than common frequency-domain filtering {{by means of an}} analysis-synthesis filter-bank (AS FB). The recently published filter-bank equalizer (FBE) is a filter(-bank) with a lower <b>signal</b> <b>delay</b> compared to the corresponding AS FB. In this contribution, the <b>signal</b> <b>delay</b> of the FBE is further reduced by approximating the time-domain filter of the FBE by a filter of lower degree. The proposed low delay filter (LDF) achieves a higher amount of noise reduction than an AS FB or FBE with the same <b>signal</b> <b>delay.</b> 1...|$|R

To address the processing in forward suppression, we applied 2 - and 4 -kHz maskers, followed by a 1 -kHz signal at varying <b>signal</b> <b>delays</b> (0 to 320  ms) and measured the signal-evoked N 1 m. A two-way analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant effect for <b>signal</b> <b>delay</b> in both masker presentation conditions. The N 1 m peak amplitude at the <b>signal</b> <b>delay</b> of 320  ms was significantly larger than those of 10, 20, 40, and 80  ms (p   0. 05). No significant enhancement for the very short <b>signal</b> <b>delay</b> was observed. The results suggest that the enhancement of N 1 m peak amplitude for short <b>signal</b> <b>delay</b> conditions is maximized when the frequency of the masker is identical to that of the signal...|$|R

40|$|The vision 1 of a {{space robot}} as an {{extended}} arm of the human operator on ground is a key component for onorbit robotic service missions. This concept of telepresence requires a high-quality sensor feedback from the space environment to the operator including stereo video and force-feedback. For the force feedback channel {{the knowledge of the}} <b>signal</b> <b>delay</b> time during operation is an important factor to increase the immersiveness of the system. In case of radio contact to space segments which are not in GEO, the <b>signal</b> <b>delay</b> time varies according to the distance between the spacecraft and the ground station.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method to achieve {{significant}} optical <b>signal</b> <b>delays</b> exploiting the effect of Autler-Townes splitting in an inhomogeneously broadened quantum dot medium. The absorption and slow-down effects are compared for three schemes i. e. Ξ, V and Λ, corresponding to different excitation configurations. Qualitative differences of the V-scheme compared to the Ξ- and Λ-scheme are found, which show that features of Autler-Townes splitting are only revealed in the V-scheme. The underlying physical mechanisms causing this discrepancy are analyzed and discussed. Finally we compare field propagation calculations of the schemes showing significantly larger achievable <b>signal</b> <b>delays</b> for the V-scheme despite finite absorption of the coupling field. This opens the possibility for using waveguide structures for both coupling and probe fields, thus significantly increasing the achievable <b>signal</b> <b>delays...</b>|$|R

40|$|A concurrent-chain {{schedule}} {{was employed to}} examine pigeons' preferences for <b>signaled</b> versus unsignaled <b>delay</b> of reinforcement in which the delay durations ranged from zero to ten seconds. In general, pigeons preferred <b>signaled</b> <b>delay</b> over unsignaled delay especially when a variable-interval 30 -second schedule operated in each initial link; when a variable-interval 90 -second schedule operated in each initial link, these preferences tended toward indifference or were attenuated. In addition, prior training seemed to exert partial control over behavior. Responding in the terminal link was higher under <b>signaled</b> <b>delay</b> than unsignaled delay in a majority of the cases. Moreover, response rates under <b>signaled</b> <b>delay</b> remained fairly constant whereas responding under unsignaled delay was initially high, but decreased systematically with delay durations as short as 2. 5 seconds. These results are consistent with a number of other studies demonstrating the significant role of a signal for impending positive stimuli...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{statistical}} analysis of delay faults {{which is based on}} the assumption of a linear combination of <b>signal</b> <b>delays</b> along a path. In order to consider distributed <b>signal</b> <b>delays</b> and to reflect that only few paths can be sensitized, the path delay fault model is applied. By choosing appropriate values for parameters, e. g. cycle time and correlations between <b>signal</b> <b>delays,</b> it is possible to adjust this approach to specific design methodologies. The statistical analysis leads to a new measure called Delay Fault Probability (DFP), which expresses the probability of a delay fault. Statistical analysis in conjunction with ATPG methods improves dynamic testing, as both an enhanced evaluation of the test set quality and a judgement of the dynamic behavior of a circuit is possible...|$|R

40|$|Next-generation {{wireless}} {{networks have}} been envisioned {{to be an}} integration of heterogeneous wireless access networks such as UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Networks) and the IEEE 802. 11 based WLAN (Wireless Local Area Networks). It is an important and challenging issue to support seamless vertical handoff management in such an integrated architecture that provides the mobile users uninterrupted service continuity anywhere, any time. In such a networking environment, the <b>signaling</b> <b>delay</b> of the vertical handoff is not fixed due to the traffic load in the backbone Internet, wireless channel quality and the distance between a mobile node and its home network. However, the currently handoff solutions implicitly considers the <b>signaling</b> <b>delay</b> as a constant value. In this thesis, we study a typical link layer assisted handoff, identifying its deficiency due to the considerably large handoff delay. We propose an adaptive vertical handoff management scheme for integrated UMTS and WLAN networks. The proposed scheme incorporates the idea of pre-handoff with adaptive handoff threshold. We estimate the handoff <b>signaling</b> <b>delay</b> in advance, therefore, providing the delay information required for making an adaptive handoff decision. Instead of setting a fixed threshold, an adaptive handoff threshold value is determined for every single MN based on the estimated handoff <b>signaling</b> <b>delay.</b> The RSS and the RSS's rate of change are {{used to determine the}} estimated handoff time instant. Extensive simulation has been conducted to verify the performance of the proposed handoff scheme...|$|R
