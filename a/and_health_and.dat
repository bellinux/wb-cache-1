However, twenty years after the ICPD sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights remain largely neglected in development initiatives. There are vast inconsistencies between knowledge, policy and practice in ensuring sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights, which is primarily due to a lack of understanding of the social and structural contexts that inhibit sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights. There are three broad examples of these contexts that can provide insight into why it is remarkably difficult to ensure sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights in developing countries: cultural and religious factors, political will, and program capacity. Realizing how these contexts impact sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights can help illuminate comprehensive strategies for the international community to consider in the effort to address sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights in the post- 2015 development agenda.

5|$|Hit points (HP) are {{a measure}} of a character's {{vitality}} <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> {{are determined by the}} class, level and constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game. Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores or character levels. When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.|$|E

Following these consultations, and shortly after assuming the presidency, Kagame launched an ambitious programme of national development called Vision 2020. The major purposes of the programme were to unite the Rwandan people and to transform Rwanda from a highly impoverished into a middle income country. The programme consists of a list of goals which the government aims to achieve before the year 2020.

With this funding seemingly guaranteed, the counties kept other taxes much lower than other counties in the state, increasing their dependence on the timber payments.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the challenges faced in mainstreaming {{the teaching of}} sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights into public <b>health</b> education. For this paper, we define sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights education as including not only its biomedical aspects but also an understanding of its history, values and politics, grounded in gender politics and social justice, addressing sexuality, and placed within a broader context of <b>health</b> systems <b>and</b> global <b>health.</b> Using a case study approach with an opportunistically selected sample of schools of public health within our regional contexts, we examine the status of sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights education {{and some of the}} drivers and obstacles to the development and delivery of sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights curricula. Despite diverse national and institutional contexts, there are many commonalities. Teaching of sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights is not fully integrated into core curricula. Existing initiatives rely on personal faculty interest or short-term courses, neither of which are truly sustainable or replicable. We call for a multidisciplinary and more comprehensive integration of sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights in public <b>health</b> education. The education of tomorrow 2 ̆ 7 s public <b>health</b> leaders is critical, <b>and</b> a strategy is needed to ensure that they understand and are prepared to engage with the range of sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights issues within their historical and political contexts...|$|R

Each neighborhood has access to its own commercial center, urban park, <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> education infrastructure. The original plan also called for a business and administrative center, built in the mid-1990s, when the city population grew rapidly more than doubling in ten years.|$|E

Two weapons are available: the rider's handgun, which can be fired with a single button press when an enemy enters the aiming reticle, and the homing laser fired by the dragon, which can lock on up to eight enemies by moving the reticle over them while holding down the fire button. Some situations with many enemies on screen {{require the use of}} the lock-on laser, while in others, quick gunshots to weak spots will prove more efficient.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1998 Act, whistleblowers in the United Kingdom had no {{protection}} against being dismissed by their employer. Although they could avoid being sued for {{breach of confidence}} thanks to a public interest defence, this did not prevent subtle or open victimisation in the workplace, including disciplinary action, dismissal, failure to gain promotion or a pay rise. During the early to mid-1990s, interest in whistleblower protection grew, partially because {{of a series of}} financial scandals <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> safety accidents, which investigations into showed could have been prevented if employees had been permitted to voice their concerns, and partially because of the work of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. In 1995 and 1996, two private member's bills dealing with whistleblowers were introduced to Parliament, by Tony Wright and Don Touhig respectively, but both efforts fell through. When Richard Shepherd proposed a similar bill, however, he got government support for it on the condition that it be an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 rather than a new area of law in its own right. Public Concern at Work, a UK-based whistleblowers charity, was involved in the drafting and consultation stages of the bill. The case of Graham Pink added to the pressure to introduce whistleblower protection legislation.|$|E

5|$|The Right to Freedom of Religion, {{covered in}} Articles 25–28, {{provides}} religious freedom to all citizens and ensures a secular state in India. According to the Constitution, {{there is no}} official State religion, and the State is required to treat all religions impartially and neutrally. Article 25 guarantees all persons the freedom of conscience {{and the right to}} preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice. This right is, however, subject to public order, morality <b>and</b> <b>health,</b> <b>and</b> the power of the State to take measures for social welfare and reform. The right to propagate, however, does not include the right to convert another individual, since it would amount to an infringement of the other's right to freedom of conscience. Article 26 guarantees all religious denominations and sects, subject to public order, morality and health, to manage their own affairs in matters of religion, set up institutions of their own for charitable or religious purposes, and own, acquire and manage property in accordance with law. These provisions do not derogate from the State's power to acquire property belonging to a religious denomination. The State is also empowered to regulate any economic, political or other secular activity associated with religious practice. Article 27 guarantees that no person can be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of any particular religion or religious institution. Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in a wholly State-funded educational institution, and educational institutions receiving aid from the State cannot compel any of their members to receive religious instruction or attend religious worship without their (or their guardian's) consent.|$|E
