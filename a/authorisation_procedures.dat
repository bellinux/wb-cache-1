2500|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} governance standards are rights vote for {{who is on the}} board of directors for investors of labour and capital. A Draft Fifth Company Law Directive proposed in 1972, which would have required EU-wide rights for employees to vote for boards stalled mainly because it attempted to require two-tier board structures, although most EU member states have codetermination today with unified boards. The Shareholder Rights Directive 2007 requires shareholders be able to make proposals, ask questions at meetings, vote by proxy and vote through intermediaries. This has become increasingly important as most company shares are held by institutional investors (primarily asset managers or banks, depending on the member state) who are holding [...] "other people's money". A large proportion of this money comes from employees and other people saving for retirement, but who do not have an effective voice. Unlike Switzerland after a 2013 people's initiative, or the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act 2010 in relation to brokers, the EU has not yet prevented intermediaries casting votes without express instructions of beneficiaries. This concentrates power into a small number of financial institutions, and creates the potential for conflicts of interest where financial institutions sell retirement, banking or products to companies in which they cast votes with other people's money. A series of rights for ultimate investors exist in the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003. This requires duties of disclosure in how a retirement fund is run, funding and insurance to guard against insolvency, but not yet that voting rights are only cast on the instructions of investors. By contrast, the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive 2009 does suggest that investors in a mutual fund or ("collective investment scheme") should control the voting rights. The UCITS Directive 2009 is primarily concerned with creating a [...] "passport". If a firm complies with rules on authorisation, and governance of the management and investment companies in an overall fund structure, it can sell its shares in a collective investment scheme across the EU. This forms a broader package of Directives on securities and financial market regulation, much of which has been shaped by experience in the banking crisis of 2007–08. Additional rules on remuneration practices, separating depositary bodies in firms from management and investment companies, and more penalties for violations were inserted in 2014. These measures are meant to decrease the risk to investors that an investment goes insolvent. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004 applies to other businesses selling financial instruments. It requires similar <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedures</b> to have a [...] "passport" [...] to sell in any EU country, and transparency of financial contracts through duties to disclose material information about products being sold, including disclosure of potential conflicts of interest with clients. The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011 applies to firms with massive quantities of capital, over €100million, essentially hedge funds and private equity firms. Similarly, it requires authorisation to sell products EU wide, and then basic transparency requirements on products being sold, requirements in remuneration policies for fund managers that are perceived to reduce [...] "risk" [...] or make pay [...] "performance" [...] related. They do not, however, require limits to pay. There are general prohibitions on conflicts of interest, and specialised prohibitions on asset stripping. The Solvency II Directive 2009 is directed particularly at insurance firms, requiring minimum capital and best practices in valuation of assets, again to avoid insolvency. The Capital Requirements Directives contain analogous rules, with a similar goals, for banks. To administer the new rules, the European System of Financial Supervision was established in 2011, and consists of three main branches: the European Securities and Markets Authority in Paris, the European Banking Authority in London and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in Frankfurt.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND In {{order to}} assess surface water {{exposure}} to active substances of plant protection products (PPP) in the EU, the FOCUS (FOrum for the Co-ordination of pesticide fate models and their USe) surface water workgroup introduced four runoff and six drainage scenarios for Step 3 of the tiered FOCUSsw approach. These scenarios may not necessarily represent realistic worst-case situations for the different Member States of the EU. Hence, the suitability of the scenarios for risk assessment in the national <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedures</b> is not known. RESULTS Using Germany as an example, the paper illustrates how national soil-climate scenarios can be developed to model entries of active substances into surface waters from runoff and erosion (using model PRZM) and from drainage (using model MACRO). In the authorisation procedure for PPPs on member state level, such soil-climate scenarios {{can be used to}} determine exposure endpoints with a defined overall percentile. CONCLUSION The approach allows the development of national specific soil-climate scenarios and to calculate percentile-based exposure endpoints. The scenarios have been integrated into a software tool analogous to FOCUS-SWASH which can be used in the future to assess surface water exposure in <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedures</b> of PPPs in Germany...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the operation of}} the European Union Reference Laboratory for Feed Additives (EURL) and its role in the <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedure</b> of feed additives in the European Union. Feed additives are authorised according to Regulation (EC) No. 1831 / 2003, which introduced a completely revised <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedure</b> and also established the EURL. The regulations authorising feed additives contain conditions of use such as legal limits of the feed additives, which require the availability of a suitable method of analysis for official control purposes under real world conditions. It is the task of the EURL to evaluate the suitability of analytical methods as proposed by the industry for this purpose. Moreover, the paper shows that one of the major challenges is the huge variety of the methodology applied in feed additive analysis, thus requiring expertise in quite different analytical areas. In order to cope with this challenge, the EURL is supported by a network of national reference laboratories (NRLs) and only the merged knowledge of all NRLs allows for a scientifically sound assessment of the analytical methods.

40|$|The Agency {{has a role}} to help {{facilitate}} the procedure for authorising the placing in service 1 of vehicles and the harmonisation of the National Safety Authorities decision making processes for authorisation. This is particularly important in the transition phase until all the Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) are complete and all networks and vehicles conform to the TSIs. In this context this report {{is part of a}} suite of initiatives intended to facilitate vehicle authorisation. These initiatives include: defining and maintaining the list of parameters to be checked for vehicle authorisation compiling and maintaining the Reference Document that: o lists the national rules for each parameter; o describes the national legal framework covering the authorisation procedure, and o records the equivalence of the various national rules for each parameter. The Agency, under the auspices of its Cross Acceptance Working Party, set about understanding and documenting the different existing national <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedures,</b> their commonalities and differences. The analysis also identified technical subject areas of authorisation that generated the most cost, time delay and uncertainty.

30|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedures</b> shows that risk assessors and competent authorities frequently argue that additional studies are not needed because the assumed risk is 'negligible' or 'tolerable'.
