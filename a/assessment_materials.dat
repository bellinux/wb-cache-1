After she normed and validated the SOI-LA instrument in the late 1970s and early 1980s, she began producing tests and corresponding remedial materials for school districts and private clinics. In many states, the SOI-LA is accepted for screening students for admission into gifted and special education school programs, and worldwide, SOI-LA is used in private clinics.|$|E

5000|$|Students using assistive {{technologies}} {{may have}} problems while navigating in the MOOC environment, accessing the platform (registration process) and even using the learning content {{contained in the}} platform. A driving force has been precisely the beneficial application of multimedia and audiovisual content {{in the area of}} education to favour language learning, the majority of web applications and pages are based on collections of shared visual and audio-visual resources (such as Flickr or YouTube). MOOCs are also full of video-presentations, animations, automatic self-assessment (some of them multimedia based) integrated into them. This introduction of audiovisual content into e-Learning platforms adds a new difficulty to the accessibility requirements, since they include new elements which widen the digital divide, and not only for people with disabilities. How MOOCs are designed, how their interfaces work, how communication is handled, how assessments take place (for instance, the way a student has to record his/her audio for a language speaking recording) and what form the learning content takes, all impact on the accessibility of these system. The challenge for any language learning environment is one of accessibility in terms of the community with whom it wishes to engage, ensuring that processes such as enrolling in a course, navigating the system, accessing learning and <b>assessment</b> <b>materials</b> and interacting with peers is achievable through the use of assistive technologies. Moreover, in accessible language learning there are still some challenges to be faced, namely: ...|$|E

40|$|Little {{standardized}} <b>assessment</b> <b>material</b> {{exists in}} Cantonese {{for the assessment}} of auditory processing disorder (APD) in children or in adults. The present study aimed to create and develop normative data for an APD test, the Cantonese Double Dichotic Digit test (CDDT). A dichotic digit test refers to two different digit stimuli that are presented to each ear simultaneously. It has been recommended to include this test within APD test batteries because it is sensitive to APD, easy and fast to administer, and not influenced by mild to moderate hearing loss. Normative data were collected from 40 young adult subjects, aged between 18 and 30 years, and 122 children aged between 6 and 11; 11 years. Norms for seven different age subgroups for the right and left ear in the free-recall and directed-right and directed-left conditions were developed. For each age subgroup, two standard deviations below the mean are suggested as cutoff scores. Results were comparable to the findings of other studies of similar speech discrimination <b>assessment</b> <b>material.</b> The CDDT 2 ̆ 7 s test-retest reliability was high and this, combined with its administrative convenience, makes it a potentially attractive assessment procedure for cases with suspected APD...|$|R
