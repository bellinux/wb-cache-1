5|$|Pliny the Elder {{wrote about}} the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii. He {{documented}} Roman beliefs about the onion's ability to improve vision ailments, aid in sleep, <b>and</b> <b>heal</b> everything from mouth sores and toothaches, to dog bites, lumbago and even dysentery. Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after it was buried in a volcanic explosion found gardens of Pliny's detailed narratives, where onions had grown.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{develops}} in puppyhood although often subclinically, {{and there may}} be pain or stiffness, discomfort on extension, or other compensating characteristics. Diagnosis generally depends on X-rays, arthroscopy, or MRI scans. While cases of OCD of the stifle go undetected <b>and</b> <b>heal</b> spontaneously, others are exhibited in acute lameness. Surgery is recommended once the animal has been deemed lame.|$|E
5|$|These ulcers occur {{periodically}} <b>and</b> <b>heal</b> completely between attacks. In {{the majority}} of cases, the individual ulcers last about 7–10 days, and ulceration episodes occur 3–6 times per year. Most appear on the non-keratinizing epithelial surfaces in the mouth (i.e. anywhere except the attached gingiva, the hard palate and the dorsum of the tongue), although the more severe forms, which are less common, may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with eating and drinking. The severe forms may be debilitating, even causing weight loss due to malnutrition.|$|E

5|$|Converts were {{provided}} with elaborate details of Ernest and Ruth Norman's purported spiritual visits to other planets. The couple believed that humans could learn from great teachers on these journeys; Ernest said that this contact held the potential to educate <b>and</b> <b>heal</b> humanity. Ernest also spoke of the scientific advancements of other worlds. The couple also discussed revelations about their past lives, including Jesus and Mary of Bethany among their past identities. Ruth stated that she had lived about 50lives over several million years; she recalled being several well-known and a few obscure people on Earth, as well as beings from other planets and an archangel. Their group developed a mythology from the accounts that Ernest and Ruth gave of these lives, including tales from their past incarnations in Atlantis and Lemuria. Some of their stories were similar to the plots of contemporary books and films, prompting Tumminia to cast their beliefs as a pastiche or bricolage of the surrounding culture.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Lost Light, {{attempting}} {{to track down}} Jhiaxus, is pulled off-course by a summons from the badly-wounded Metroplex, via a severed portion of his thumb the ship had previously encountered. Finding the ancient Autobot, and his companions Windblade, Chromia and Nautica on the ocean planet Hydrophena, the crew defends him and themselves against an army of Shockwave's Ammonite minions and use their ship's engines to give him enough of a power boost to teleport them all back home to Cybertron. They return as the Necrotitan {{is in the middle}} of razing Iacon at Shockwave's command; Megatron, having fallen in with Bumblebee, uses his space bridge to teleport Metroplex's thumb — revealed to contain another of Shockwave's ores — from the Lost Light back into its owner's hand, giving him the energy to defeat the Necrotitan <b>and</b> <b>heal</b> the plague.|$|E

5|$|On Nimbus III, the Enterprise crew {{discovers that}} renegade Vulcan Sybok, Spock's half-brother, {{is behind the}} hostage crisis. Sybok reveals the hostage {{situation}} was a ruse to lure a starship to Nimbus III. Sybok wants to use a ship to reach the mythical planet Sha Ka Ree, the place where creation began; the planet lies behind a seemingly impenetrable barrier {{near the center of}} the galaxy. Sybok uses his unique ability to reveal <b>and</b> <b>heal</b> the innermost pain of a person through the mind meld to subvert the wills of the hostages and crew members. Only Spock and Kirk prove resistant to Sybok; Spock is unmoved by the experience and Kirk refuses the Vulcan's offer, telling him that his pain is what makes him human. Sybok reluctantly declares a truce with Kirk, realizing he needs his leadership experience to navigate the Enterprise to Sha Ka Ree.|$|E

25|$|Usually, {{deadwood}} {{techniques for}} branches {{are applied to}} conifers. Deciduous trees tend to shed dead branches <b>and</b> <b>heal</b> over the wound, while conifers often retain the dead limb, which naturally becomes weathered and eroded over time. Most deadwood techniques for the tree's trunk apply equally well to deciduous and to conifer bonsai, although the driftwood style (in which much of the trunk is dead) is generally restricted to conifers.|$|E

He often drew, painted, or made objects and constructions at times of emotional distress, which he recognized as more than recreational.|$|E

25|$|When Mai Chaza recovered, she {{was hailed}} as having {{returned}} from the dead. She announced {{that she had been}} instructed by God to become a faith healer, live a celibate life, <b>and</b> <b>heal</b> the sick, especially barren women. She also claimed to have been reconciled with the spirit of her dead sister-in-law. She began working as a n'anga, a traditional healer, telling people the causes of their illnesses in exchange for a payment of two shillings and sixpence. The Methodist hierarchy ordered her to stop and refused her request to have her own preaching circuit. She responded by establishing her own unauthorised circuit.|$|E
25|$|A scar is {{the product}} of the body's repair {{mechanism}} after tissue injury. If a wound heals quickly within two weeks with new formation of skin, minimal collagen will be deposited and no scar will form. Generally, if a wound takes longer than three to four weeks to become covered, a scar will form. Small full thickness wounds under 2mm reepithilize fast <b>and</b> <b>heal</b> scar free. Deep second-degree burns heal with scarring and hair loss. Sweat glands do not form in scar tissue, which impairs the regulation of body temperature. Elastic fibers are generally not detected in scar tissue younger than 3 months old. In scars rete pegs are lost; through a lack of rete pegs scars tend to shear easier than normal tissue.|$|E
25|$|Azad {{had been}} the Congress {{president}} since 1939, so he volunteered to resign in 1946. He nominated Nehru, who replaced him as Congress president and led the Congress into the interim government. Azad was appointed to head the Department of Education. However, Jinnah's Direct Action Day agitation for Pakistan, launched on 16 August sparked communal violence across India. Thousands of people were killed as Azad travelled across Bengal and Bihar to calm the tensions <b>and</b> <b>heal</b> relations between Muslims and Hindus. Despite Azad's call for Hindu-Muslim unity, Jinnah's popularity amongst Muslims soared and the League entered a coalition with the Congress in December, but continued to boycott the constituent assembly. Later in his autobiography, Azad indicated Patel having become more pro-partition than the Muslim League, {{largely due to the}} League's not co-operating with the Congress in the provisional government on any issue.|$|E
