5|$|If the player's {{character}} {{falls in}} battle, {{they are forced}} to restart from the beginning, with all their items and experience points gone; to avoid this, the player can store items in warehouses found in towns they travel through. Because of this, the player makes long-term progress by upgrading powerful items at village blacksmiths and storing them in warehouses, while upgrading their character is more of a temporary improvement. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, the player can avoid having to start over by getting rescued by another player: this is done by giving the other player <b>a</b> <b>rescue</b> quest, either through a password or the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. When a player embarks on <b>a</b> <b>rescue</b> mission, they start from level 1 and have to reach the fallen character without stopping at towns on their way. If they succeed, the rescued player can proceed from where they left off, and keep their items and experience points.|$|E
