This multi-functionality allows {{to make the most of}} limited resource or budget, but having a single team respond to any emergency.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's {{publications}} {{were rarely}} luxury goods: he priced his merchandise competitively, but always within {{the reach of}} the middle class, the audience he most wanted to serve. One way that he reduced costs was by printing texts in the provinces and then importing them to London; many of Priestley's works, for example, were printed locally in Birmingham. Johnson did not take great care with the printing of many of his books; they <b>are</b> <b>full</b> of errors and poorly bound. But as they were often printed extremely quickly to respond to a particular event, this was expected by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that <b>are</b> <b>full</b> and loud, and {{extremely}} varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived. Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact calls, are animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put-put.|$|E

5|$|The Assembly was {{a product}} of the British Reformed tradition, taking as a major source the Thirty-Nine Articles as well as the {{theology}} of James Ussher and his Irish Articles of 1615. The divines also considered themselves to be within the broader European Reformed tradition. They were in frequent correspondence with continental Reformed theologians, and sought their approval. They also drew upon the pre-Reformation British theological tradition, which emphasized biblical knowledge and was influenced by the Augustinian theological tradition exemplified by Anselm, Thomas Bradwardine, and John Wycliffe. The recorded debates of the Assembly <b>are</b> <b>full</b> of citations of church fathers and medieval scholastic theologians.|$|E

5|$|The {{plant life}} around the Griffin Reservoir on Leggetts Creek {{includes}} various native trees and understory plants. From the reservoir downstream to an intake pond near Interstate 81, the creek's riparian buffer contains old growth forest, including tulip poplar trees. In addition to tulip popular, hemlock and pine also {{occur in the}} Griffin Mills reach of the creek. Near Leggetts Gap, the creek has some riparian buffering. Even in its lower reaches, the it has a stable vegetative cover in some areas. However, other areas <b>are</b> <b>full</b> of invasive plants. Major invasive plant species include Japanese knotweed, Norway Maple, and Ailanthus. Overall, the riparian buffer of the creek mainly consists of grassland and forested land.|$|E

5|$|Bird {{collections}} {{are used for}} a wide variety of purposes. All biological species including those of birds are represented by a holotype, the vast majority of which <b>are</b> <b>full</b> specimens (mostly skins) and in modern times explicitly designated in the original description of the taxon. All other putative members of the species may be compared to the holotype to confirm their identification. Rigorous studies of avian taxonomy are based on specimens from bird collections. Taxonomic studies rely on morphological and genetic characters to determine species limits and evolutionary relationships. Museum specimens have been the preferred source for scoring these s, as they allow studies to be replicated – anyone may go back and repeat the study using the same specimens to verify the conclusions. However, it has alternatively been argued that such re-examination can be undertaken from archived photographs without killing the study piece.|$|E

5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced panty {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, {{with the emergence of}} skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline {{and the rise of the}} leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually <b>are</b> <b>full</b> in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Test cricket {{is played}} between {{international}} cricket teams who <b>are</b> <b>Full</b> Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Unlike One Day Internationals, Test matches consist of two innings per team, having no limit in their number of overs.

The duration of Tests, currently limited to five days, has varied through Test history, ranging from {{three days to}} timeless matches. The earliest match now recognised as a Test was played between England and Australia in March 1877; since then there have been over 2,000 Tests played by 11 teams. The frequency of Tests has steadily increased {{partly because of the}} increase in the number of Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue.|$|E
