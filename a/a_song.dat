40|$|The song {{system of}} Prairie Warblers can be {{partitioned}} into two physically and functionally distinct categories. <b>A</b> <b>songs</b> and B songs {{can be distinguished}} by their overall form and many acoustic characteristics. <b>A</b> <b>songs</b> relative to B songs, were lower in frequency, had {{a greater number of}} shorter “buzzy” notes and were longer in duration. Males tended to use <b>A</b> <b>songs</b> in <b>an</b> intersexual context. Unmated males sung <b>A</b> <b>songs</b> almost exclusively. <b>A</b> <b>songs</b> were also used in the presence of females throughout the breeding season. B songs {{were more likely to be}} used in an intersexual context. Once males were mated they began to sing a dawn chorus of B songs and tended to sing a higher percentage of B songs throughout the day. Males which either experimentally or naturally had their mate removed switched to singing <b>A</b> <b>songs</b> at <b>a</b> high rate. ^ The geographic pattern of song types differed for <b>A</b> and B <b>songs.</b> Males within <b>a</b> population tended to have B <b>songs,</b> but not <b>A</b> <b>songs,</b> that were more similar in acoustic characteristics. The macrogeographic pattern of song types was also different in the two <b>song</b> categories. <b>A</b> <b>songs</b> tended to be widely distributed throughout the species range. In contrast many B song forms where limited geographically. ...|$|R

50|$|Prairie warblers {{have two}} {{categories}} of songs, referred to as Type A and Type B. Type <b>A</b> <b>songs</b> are typically <b>a</b> series of ascending buzzy notes. The B <b>songs</b> are <b>an</b> ascending series of whistled notes that often contain some buzzy notes. Compared to <b>A</b> <b>songs,</b> the B songs are lower in pitch, have fewer, longer notes. The total song length is longer as well in Type B songs. The use of these two song categories is associated with certain contexts. <b>A</b> <b>songs</b> are sung throughout the day when males first arrive on their breeding grounds. Once males are paired they begin to sing B songs during the dawn chorus and then will intersperse <b>A</b> <b>songs</b> in their singing {{during the rest of}} the day. During this later period of singing <b>A</b> <b>songs</b> are typically used near females, near the nest, and in the center of their territories. In contrast B songs are used when interacting or fighting with other males and near the borders of their territories.|$|R
