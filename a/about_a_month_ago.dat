25|$|Sitting {{after dinner}} at Ilam <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>ago,</b> I said I saw {{no hope for}} a better state of public policy here unless {{there was a new}} {{newspaper}} started which would tell the truth without fear or favour. In five minutes the thing was settled. If I would undertake the management of it, it was to be started and five hundred pound was put down on the spot; it was soon found there was a little press and some types to be bought. I promised I would write and would exercise a general superintendence over the matter... The first number appeared three weeks after the conversation referred to.|$|E

Lawrence noted, [...] "We weren't seeing fully rendered shots until <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>ago.</b> The movie starts {{to take on}} a whole other life. It's not until later that you can judge a movie as a whole and go, 'Huh, maybe we should shoot this little piece in the middle, or tweak this a little bit.' It just so happened that our re-shoots revolved around the end of the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2007, Record Collector {{published}} {{an interview with}} Ray Davies in which he said, [...] "I spoke to Quaife <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>ago</b> and he dearly wants to make another record with me. I think Dave's getting better and Mick's still playing. It {{would be great to}} get back together just to see what musical ideas we had, and what would happen." [...] The Daily Mail subsequently interpreted his comments as a declaration that a reunion of the band's original line-up was imminent. Dave Davies swiftly rejected the idea of a reunion. He told a reporter that [...] "it would be like a bad remake of Night of the Living Dead" [...] and added, [...] "Ray has been doing Karaoke Kinks shows since 1996." ...|$|E

With her {{drooping}} head, her flowing dark hair, her great brown eyes, she looked like the nymph of a wood-brook, a haunter of shadows, a creature sprung from the wild. But she was mortal maid, and he--what a fool he had been! Presently he would laugh at himself, when this dazed agony should clear away from his brain. He followed her down the long field to the bay shore. Now and then she paused and looked back {{to see if he}} were coming, but she never spoke. When she reached the shore road she turned and went along it until they came to an old grey house fronting the calm grey harbour. At its gate she paused. Roger knew now who she was. Catherine had told him <b>about</b> her <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R
40|$|Something happened	 last	week	 to	cause	me	 to	reflect	on	how	I	became	technologically	knowl-edgeable {{enough to}} edit a {{technology}} column. One of my graduate assistants {{asked me to}} explain (1) how a patron clicking on a link in an article index is taken to the full-text of the journal article from another vendor, and (2) what happened behind the scenes when the patron was off-campus to allow remote access. I found myself explaining open URLs, link resolvers, digital object identifier systems (DOIs), and proxy server authentication. 1 I realized that I {{learned a lot of}} technical stuff somewhere between graduat-ing with my master’s in LIS and now. How did this happen? I never set out to be a technology guru. I didn’t take any tech classes in library school (and I graduated in 1999, so a lot has changed). I don’t feel like I am on the bleeding edge of anything. Any time I mention some new technology to my husband, he says “yes, I read <b>about</b> that <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>ago.</b> ” Yet I have a not-so-quiet pride in my ability to keep up and learn what is new. I am not a systems engineer, data security specialist, or programmer, but I can hold my own in meetings. While explaining DOIs to my graduate assistant, I deter-mined that I am probably a lot like many readers of Referenc...|$|R
500|$|With [...] "Ironic", Morissette denoted {{her support}} for {{same-sex}} marriage. In March 2004, Morissette amended a lyric at the fifteenth annual GLAAD Media Awards: [...] "It's meeting {{the man of}} my dreams /And then meeting his beautiful husband". She commented to USA Today that her support about same-sex unions [...] "goes a step further than clever lyrics." [...] She remarked that [...] " [...] fantasy would now be to marry some of [...] gay couple friends." [...] Later in June 2004, she said to VH1: [...] "I don't have any gay-couple friends who are formally engaged, but I would be honored to support the gay community in that way ... I did it {{as a sort of}} spontaneous thing at a radio station <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>ago</b> with a couple, and my heart was so with them." [...] Morissette recorded an acoustic version of the song with the changed lyric for her iTunes Originals release, in 2004. Another acoustic version was recorded for the album Jagged Little Pill Acoustic, as well for the compilation album Cities 97 Sampler, Volume 16 (2004). The song was also performed in a duo with Avril Lavigne at the House of Blues in 2005.|$|E

She just wrote how she felt about that.|$|E
60|$|Ben Greenway was a Scotchman, who {{had for a}} {{long time}} been Major Bonnet's most trusted servant. He was a good farmer, was apt at {{carpenter}} work, and knew <b>a</b> good deal <b>about</b> masonry. <b>A</b> few <b>months</b> <b>ago,</b> any one living in that region would have been likely to say, if the subject had been brought up, that without Ben Greenway Major Bonnet could not get along at all, not even for a day, for he depended upon him in so many ways. And yet, now the master of the estate was about to depart, for nobody knew how long, and leave his faithful servant behind. The reason he gave was, that Ben could not be spared from the farm; but people in general, and Ben in particular, thought this very poor reasoning. Any sort of business which made it necessary for Major Bonnet to separate himself from Ben Greenway was a very poor business, and should not be entered upon.|$|R
5000|$|Anderson's {{appointment}} {{must give}} general satisfaction. I remember when I went to Edinburgh first in November 1818 Anderson was newly {{come out to}} the bar that same year, and McNeill two years before...Anderson is a son of the late Mr Anderson of Moredun. He is connected with the Forbeses and Hays, and his brother {{is now one of the}} Partners of Sir William Forbes & Company's Bank. There is a Colony of the Andersons in and about Edinburgh such as the Andersons of St Germains, Moredun, &c &c - all cousins, and all descended from decent East Lothian farmers as I believe and elevated into gentry some Century back. If I remember right their ancestor acted as Guide to Charles Edward's Army in their attack upon Cope through the Marshes of Preston to which neighbourhood he belonged...He is a thin pale man, six feet five or six inches high, with a delicate complexion, gentlemanlike look, mild, modest and respectable. His gait in walking has a peculiar twist that reminds one of a bent willow, or a serpent or Eel. His voice is weak and squeaking, but Clear, and his mind like his person is respectable. He is a good lawyer, is acute, fluent in speech, but neither eloquent nor forcible - and is apt to be somewhat diffuse and prolix in his pleadings. His fluency too is more acquired than natural. - In the Teind Court the whole Judges sit together, and I remember Adam Anderson, then a boyish looking lad in the summer of 1819 or 1820, rising up in the middle of a very thronged bar and crowded Court, to make a motion. His length appeared awkward and preposterous - he mistook his motion, stammered out something in great trepidation, and when the Lord President Hope with a look of surprise and good humour corrected his mistake poor Adam sat down amidst a general titter from the bench, bar and miscellaneous crowd of agents and clerks behind the bar. Now he sits in a silk gown from within the bar and enjoys a first rate practice, with the general estimation and respect of the profession.When the Conservatives came in sic December 1834 Duncan McNeill was appointed Solicitor-General and Anderson succeeded him as Sheriff of Perth. He resigned this office <b>about</b> <b>a</b> twelve <b>month</b> <b>ago</b> amidst the general regret of all classes and parties in the county in favour of Whigham, his senior by two years at the bar. He is a batchelor. So much for Anderson.|$|R
