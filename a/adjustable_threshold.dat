Its approach is known as Secondary Page Caching.

Removing a page from a working set is not technically a page-replacement operation, but effectively identifies that page as a candidate. A page whose backing store is still valid (whose contents are not dirty, or otherwise {{do not need to}} be preserved) is placed on the tail of the Free Page List.

50|$|Triggering allows {{stationary}} {{display of}} a repeating waveform, as multiple repetitions of the waveform are drawn over {{exactly the same}} trace on the phosphor screen. A triggered sweep maintains the calibration of sweep speed, {{making it possible to}} measure properties of the waveform such as frequency, phase, rise time, and others, that would not otherwise be possible. Furthermore, triggering can occur at varying intervals, so there is no requirement that the input signal be periodic.Triggered-sweep oscilloscopes compare the vertical deflection signal (or rate of change of the signal) with an <b>adjustable</b> <b>threshold,</b> referred to as trigger level. As well, the trigger circuits also recognize the slope direction of the vertical signal when it crosses the threshold—whether the vertical signal is positive-going or negative-going at the crossing. This is called trigger polarity. When the vertical signal crosses the set trigger level and in the desired direction, the trigger circuit unblanks the CRT and starts an accurate linear sweep. After the completion of the horizontal sweep, the next sweep will occur when the signal once again crosses the threshold trigger.|$|E

5000|$|Insulin {{resistance}} {{implies that}} the body's cells (primarily muscle) lose sensitivity to insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas to promote glucose utilization. At the molecular level, a cell senses insulin through insulin receptors, with the signal propagating through a cascade of molecules collectively known as PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Recent studies suggested that the pathway may operate as a bistable switch under physiologic conditions for certain types of cells, and insulin response {{may well be a}} threshold phenomenon. [...] The pathway's sensitivity to insulin may be blunted by many factors such as free fatty acids, causing insulin resistance. From a broader perspective, however, sensitivity tuning (including sensitivity reduction) is a common practice for an organism to adapt to the changing environment or metabolic conditions. Pregnancy, for example, is a prominent change of metabolic conditions, under which the mother has to reduce her muscles' insulin sensitivity to spare more glucose for the brains (the mother's brain and the fetal brain). This can be achieved through raising the response threshold (i.e., postponing the onset of sensitivity) by secreting placental growth factor to interfere with the interaction between insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and PI3K, which is the essence of the so-called <b>adjustable</b> <b>threshold</b> hypothesis of insulin resistance.|$|E

After a parametrization phase, CrossLink delegates the determination of sequence relationships to established tools (BLAST, Vmatch and RNAhybrid) and then constructs a network.

40|$|The {{developed}} direct converting X-ray line detectors offer {{a number}} of advantages in comparison to other X-ray sensor concepts. Direct converting X-ray detectors are based on absorption of X-rays in semiconductor material, {{which leads to a}} generation of charge carriers. By applying high bias voltage charge carriers can be separated and with this the arising current pulse can be assessed by suitable readout integrated circuits (ICs) subsequently. The X-ray absorber itself is implemented as a diode based on GaAs to use it in the reverse direction. It exhibits low dark currents and can therefore be used at room temperatures. The GaAs absorber has a structured top electrode designed on variable bonding and high breakdown voltages. The implemented GaAs absorber exhibits a pixel size of 100 m while the readout IC features fast dead-time-free readout, energy discrimination by two individually <b>adjustable</b> <b>thresholds</b> with 20 bit deep counters and radiation-hard design on chip level. These properties guarantee the application as fast and thus sensitive line detector for imaging processes. Another advantage of the imaging line detector is the cascadability of several sensor modules with 1024 pixels each. This property ensures that the 102. 4 mm long sensor modules can be concatenated virtually with arbitrary length gaplessly. The readout ICs hitting radiation dose can be further minimized by implementing constructive steps to ensure longer lifetime of the sensor module. Furthermore, first results using the introduced sensor module for solid state X-ray detection are discussed...|$|R

While CPU power reduction of HPC applications using Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) has been explored thoroughly, CPU power management for large scale parallel systems at system level has left unexplored. In this {{paper we propose}} a power-aware parallel job scheduler assuming DVFS enabled clusters. Traditional parallel job schedulers determine when a job will be run, power aware ones should assign CPU frequency which it will be run at. We have introduced two <b>adjustable</b> <b>thresholds</b> in order to enable fine grain energy performance trade-off control. Since our power reduction approach is policy independent it can be added to any parallel job scheduling policy. Furthermore, we have done an analysis of HPC system dimension. Running an application at lower frequency on more processors can be more energy efficient than running it at the highest CPU frequency on less processors. This paper investigates whether having more DVFS enabled processors and same load can lead to better energy efficiency and performance. Five workload logs from systems in production use with up to 9 216 processors are simulated to evaluate the proposed algorithm and the dimensioning problem. Our approach decreases CPU energy by 7 %- 18 % on average depending on allowed job performance penalty.
