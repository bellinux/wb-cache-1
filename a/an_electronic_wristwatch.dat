50|$|In 1954, Swiss {{engineer}} Max Hetzel developed <b>an</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>wristwatch</b> {{that used}} an electrically charged tuning fork {{powered by a}} 1.35 volt battery. The tuning fork resonated at precisely 360 Hz and it powered {{the hands of the}} watch through an electro-mechanical gear train. This watch was called the Accutron and was marketed by Bulova, starting in 1960. Although Bulova did not have the first battery-powered wristwatch, the Accutron was a powerful catalyst, as by that time the Swiss watch-manufacturing industry was a mature industry with a centuries-old global market and deeply entrenched patterns of manufacturing, marketing and sales.|$|E

50|$|The first prototypes of <b>an</b> <b>electronic</b> quartz <b>wristwatch</b> (not just {{portable}} quartz {{watches as}} the Seiko timekeeping devices at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964) {{were made by the}} CEH research laboratory in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. From 1965 through 1967 pioneering development work was done on a miniaturized 8192 Hz quartz oscillator, a thermo-compensation module and an inhouse-made, dedicated integrated circuit (unlike the hybrid circuits used in the later Seiko Astron wristwatch). As a result, the BETA 1 prototype set new timekeeping performance records at the International Chronometric Competition held at the Observatory of Neuchâtel in 1967. In 1970, 18 manufacturers exhibited production versions of the beta 21 wristwatch, including the Omega Electroquartz as well as Patek Philippe, Rolex Oysterquartz and Piaget.|$|R
50|$|Riehl was {{instrumental}} in many additional innovations in electronic timekeeping related to wristwatches including: smart calendar programming, owner-controlled calibration, automatic adjustment to daylight savings, automatic adjustments for leap year, perpetual calendars, and the first LED digital <b>electronic</b> <b>wristwatch</b> to be waterproof {{to a depth of}} 750 feet.|$|R
50|$|Suunto makes {{multi-function}} <b>electronic</b> <b>wristwatches</b> {{such as the}} Core, Ambit, Vector, X-Lander, and X10, {{which can}} provide a variety of functions including compass bearings, altitude, training effect and even GPS location, depending on model. Suunto's multi-function electronic sport watches are made for different sports like sailing, golfing, hiking, mountaineering, alpine skiing and training.|$|R
50|$|Rising to {{popularity}} in the early 1980s, game watches are <b>electronic</b> <b>wristwatches</b> that allow the wearer to access an included video game that uses the display in the watch's face as its screen.

5000|$|Gary Daniels was {{designing}} ICs for <b>electronic</b> <b>wristwatches</b> when Motorola {{shut down}} their Timepiece Electronics Unit. Tom Bennett {{offered him a}} job in the microprocessor group in November 1974. Bennett did not want to leave the Phoenix area so Gary Daniels managed the microprocessor development in Austin. (Daniels was the microprocessor design manager for the next ten years before he was promoted to a vice president.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{attempts to}} reduce the amount of power required by <b>an</b> <b>electronic</b> device were related to the development of the <b>wristwatch.</b> <b>Electronic</b> watches require electricity as a power source, and some mechanical movements and hybrid electronic-mechanical movements also require electricity. Usually the electricity is provided by a replaceable battery. The first use of electrical power in watches was as a substitute for the mainspring, to remove the need for winding. The first electrically powered watch, the Hamilton Electric 500, was released in 1957 by the Hamilton Watch Company of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.|$|R

5000|$|An {{electronic}} keyboard or digital keyboard is <b>an</b> <b>electronic</b> musical instrument, <b>an</b> <b>electronic</b> or digital derivative of keyboard instruments.Broadly speaking, {{in a popular}} music context, the term {{electronic keyboard}} or just a keyboard mostly refers to any type of digital or electronic keyboard instrument.
