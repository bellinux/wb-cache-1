2500|$|The AC-6 is a [...] {{wing span}} {{development}} of the [...] span AC-5M, with longer, higher aspect ratio wings terminating in winglets. Like the AC-5, the AC-6 wing employs a Wortmann FX 60-157 <b>airfoil.</b> <b>Assembly</b> of the wing to the fuselage uses a cam pin and incorporates automatic hookups for the ailerons and air brakes. The landing gear is a retractable [...] tire monowheel gear suspended with a pneumatic-hydraulic shock absorber. The wheel has a lever and cable operated drum brake. The cockpit can accommodate pilots up to [...] in height. The canopy provides 300° field of view and is jettisonable.|$|E

A small airfoil with a rotating nose, originally built for the demonstration of static stall control, {{was placed in a}} wind tunnel and dynamically pitched. The flow around the airfoil during pitch was successfully visualized and filmed. It exhibited dynamic trailing edge separation of vorticity without leading edge dynamic stall.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the aeroelastic stability of an <b>airfoil</b> or an <b>assembly</b> of turbomachinery is strongly influenced by the level of accuracy of the measured or predicted aerodynamic loads. For this reason, the unsteady lift and moment coefficients {{are more and more}} frequently computed by highly developed CFD methods which are able to take into account complex flow geometries as well as basic physical flow effects such as compressibility and viscosity...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to compare the effects of two different diffuser vane geometries on the performance of a centrifugal compressor. Vaned diffusers are commonly used in aeroengines because they can achieve higher pressure recoveries than vaneless diffusers of similar size. Improving the diffuser’s pressure recovery and effectiveness can result in overall compressor performance benefits that are sought out by engine manufacturers looking to improve overall engine efficiency. An airfoil vane was tested and compared to a baseline wedge diffuser in the Purdue CSTAR research facility, where the centrifugal compressor used for this study is intended to be the last stage of an axial-centrifugal compressor. ^ The overall stage performance for the compressor with the airfoil diffuser was first obtained at open impeller tip clearances and then at tight clearances. In the tight clearance configuration, the compressor consistently had higher total pressure ratio and higher isentropic efficiency compared to the open clearance configuration. In particular, impeller isentropic efficiency and shroud static pressure along the entire impeller passage were highest at the tight impeller clearance configuration, indicating less losses due to tip leakage flow. The reduction in tip leakage flow, and resulting blockage, at tight clearance operation was also suggested by the increase in choke mass flow rate for all corrected speeds. ^ For the comparison of the airfoil and wedge diffuser assemblies, data were acquired with the impeller in the tight clearance configuration. Despite slight differences in exducer tip clearances (less than 2 x 10 - 3 in.), stage total pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency at 100 % corrected speed were not significantly different between the two diffuser assemblies. Upon closer inspection of individual components, the airfoil diffuser actually had, on average, higher pressure recovery and higher diffuser effectiveness than the wedge diffuser. However, the <b>airfoil</b> diffuser <b>assembly</b> had higher losses in the deswirl region compared to the wedge diffuser assembly. Excluding measurements from the deswirl, the total pressure ratio for the <b>airfoil</b> diffuser <b>assembly</b> was slightly greater than that of the wedge diffuser assembly. A physical mismatch in the airfoil diffuser and deswirl assembly could be responsible for the losses recorded in the deswirl region and could have resulted in the limited performance improvements observed. Additionally, the similar vane geometries at the leading edge (in terms of inlet metal angle and thickness) combined with any deviation from design during manufacturing could have limited the predicted performance benefits. ...|$|R
