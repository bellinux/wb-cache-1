40|$|The Baron fiber {{classifier}} is {{an instrument}} used to separate fibers by length. The flow combination section (FCS) of this instrument is an upstream annular region, where an aerosol of uncharged fibers is introduced {{along with two}} sheath flows; length separation occurs by dielectrophoresis downstream in the flow classification section. In its current implementation at NIOSH, the instrument is capable of processing only very small quantities of fibers. In order to prepare large quantities of length-separated fibers for toxicological studies, the throughput of the instrument needs to be increased, and hence, higher <b>aerosol</b> <b>flow</b> rates need to be considered. However, higher <b>aerosol</b> <b>flow</b> rates may give rise to flow separation or vortex formation in the FCS, arising from the sudden expansion of the aerosol at the inlet nozzle. The goal of the present investigation is to understand {{the interaction of the}} sheath and aerosol flows inside the FCS, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and to identify possible limits to increasing <b>aerosol</b> <b>flow</b> rates. Numerical solutions are obtained using an axisymmetric model of the FCS, and solving the Navier-Stokes equations governing these flows; in this study, the <b>aerosol</b> <b>flow</b> is treated purely aerodynamically. Results of computations are presented for four different flow rates. The geometry of the converging outer cylinder, along with the two sheath flows, is effective in preventing vortex formation in the FCS for aerosol-to-sheath flow inlet velocity ratios below ~ 50.

40|$|Drug {{delivery}} via the pulmonary route {{has increasingly}} received much attention in recent years. Inhalable particles that {{are capable of}} reaching the deep lungs for the intended application can be achieved by particle engineering methods and use of appropriate inhalation device. This study seeks to develop a carrier-free formulation for poorly water soluble drugs with desirable aerosol properties for pulmonary therapy. The Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) used in this work, Pirfenidone and Budesonide are treatment drugs for some pulmonary diseases hence their delivery via the pulmonary route will be better suited for fast local action. Carrier-free drug powders were formulated using particle engineering methods to achieve the desirable aerosol properties for inhalation therapy. The <b>aerosol</b> <b>flow</b> reactor method was utilized in this study and the leucine coating on the powder particles were formed by physical vapour deposition of leucine. Prior to the <b>aerosol</b> <b>flow</b> reactor step, precursor solutions were prepared with varying concentrations of leucine and also an exogenous surfactant, Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). The precursor solutions were prepared by wet milling of leucine and DPPC in ethanol. The drug was then added to the milled suspension to get the precursor solution ready for the aerosol process. In the <b>aerosol</b> <b>flow</b> reactor, the leucine formed nanocrystals which were deposited onto the dried drug particles by physical vapour deposition (PVD). Two poorly-water soluble drugs were formulated using varying leucine concentrations and the resulting powders were investigated with different inhalers for their aerosolization behaviours. The morphologies of the coated fine powders were also studied by scanning electron microscopy. Pirfenidone powders showed agglomerated particles with the degree of agglomeration increasing with decreasing leucine concentration. This made the powders less flowable and dispersible, but the deagglomeration principle of the inhalation device improved the aerosolization properties. The powder with less leucine content had agglomerates which were rather difficult to separate even with the inhalation device’s deagglomeration principle. The particle size distribution was much higher and most likely to be too large for inhalation. The Budesonide particles, having sustained the heat in the <b>aerosol</b> <b>flow</b> reactor showed much spherical particles with minimal surface contact.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to study the {{deliquescence}} kinetics of aerosol particles of atmospheric significance. In {{the course of this}} work a novel experimental method was developed, which utilizes the measurement of the water vapor loss in laminar <b>aerosol</b> <b>flow</b> to determine vapor uptake on the aerosol surface. The newly designed flow tube apparatus uses a system of Nafion based dryers and humidifiers, which greatly simplifies the optimization and control of the relative humidity in the <b>aerosol</b> <b>flow.</b> The design, which also utilizes a movable inlet, enables easy variation of the aerosol residence time in the deliquescence reactor, while keeping other experimental conditions constant. 	In this study, a numerical retrieval procedure was used to characterize aerosols in situ from their IR extinction spectra. The procedure allows that the aerosol size, number distribution, phase and composition be determined, provided the optical constants of all the components (materials) comprising the aerosol are known. For the purpose of studying the deliquescence kinetics of ammonium sulfate aerosol and monitoring their evolution from solid to liquid (state), we have acquired a set of optical constants for a range of (NH 4) 2 SO 4 compositions. A set of experiments in a somewhat modified flow tube set up was performed to produce AMS aerosols of known composition, including solid, saturated (water) solution (40 % wt.) and a series of diluted solutions with composition ranging between 40 and 10 % wt. in 5 % increments. The IR spectra of these model aerosols were used to derive the optical constants, using an inversion method proposed by Clapp. The derived refractive indices, which cover the spectral range from 590 to 5990 cm- 1 with 2 cm- 1 resolution, were compared with those already available in the literature. Using various examples to compare the quality of fittings to experimental spectra, we demonstrated that our optical constants present an improvement relative to those previously reported by B. Toon’s (for crystalline AMS) and S. Martin’s (for AMS solution). The suitability of applying this procedure to ammonium sulfate aerosols and its sensitivity to spectral range was also investigated and discussed. 	 	As a preparatory step for the deliquescence kinetics study, our new flow tube apparatus and the tools for the characterization of aerosol were verified in a standard deliquescence experiment performed on (NH 4) 2 SO 4 aerosols. The deliquescence process of an equilibrated <b>aerosol</b> <b>flow</b> was monitored as a function of increasing humidity and the deliquescence relative humidity (DRH) determined to be 79. 6 ± 0. 85 % which is, within experimental uncertainty, in an excellent agreement with the results reported by other research groups. 	In the kinetic experiment, a flow of solid (NH 4) 2 SO 4 aerosols is pre-humidified to a humidity close to, but enough below DRH that there is no detectable amount of liquid aerosols in the system. Such an equilibrated <b>aerosol</b> <b>flow</b> was introduced to the deliquescence reactor where it is further humidified in a controllable manner, by varying the position of the movable inlet. The amount of water transferred to the aerosol through the Nafion membrane was closely monitored, as well as the resulting increase in the water content in the <b>aerosol</b> <b>flow</b> (both gaseous and liquid). This was achieved by measuring the RHs and flow rates of the aerosol and humidification flow, and the characterization of aerosol composition and concentration using their IR spectra. The experimental conditions and aerosol residence times in the reactor where chosen such that no other diluted solution except for saturated (NH 4) 2 SO 4 droplets were produced in the process. The number distribution of deliquesced aerosols and the corresponding change in the water content in the <b>aerosol</b> <b>flow</b> were used by a newly developed kinetic model to determine the kinetics of the deliquescence process. Assuming fully developed laminar flow conditions, the water vapor concentration in the flow and its depletion in the presence of aerosol was modeled, to retrieve the value of the water vapor uptake. In the case of micron-sized ammonium sulfate aerosols, which were used in this study, the uptake coefficient,, was determined to be 0. 0072 ± 6. 54 x 10 - 3.

The results were used for the evaluation of the corresponding aerosol extinction coefficients as a function of size, shape and index of refraction. The thus obtained aerosol extinction efficiencies were compared to theoretical models. Good agreement with theory was observed for NaCl aerosols, while the results for CuCl 2 · 2 H 2 O particulates required averaging over particle size and over the orientation dependent index of refraction. The actual sensitivity currently achieved was as low as an extinction coefficient of 8 × 10 − 8 cm− 1, which means detection capability of about six water micro-particulates per cm 3.

The differential mobility analyzer (DMA) {{is one of the}} most commonly used devices for classifying and measuring nanometersized aerosol particles between 1 nm to 1 μm in diameter, based on their electrical mobility. The DMA can be described as an assembly of two concentrically cylindrical electrodes with an air gap between the walls. In the DMA, air and <b>aerosol</b> <b>flows</b> enter from one end, pass through the annulus and exit the other end. An electric field is applied between the inner and outer electrodes. Particles having a specific mobility exit with the monodisperse air flow through a small slit located at the bottom of the inner electrode. These particles are transferred to a particle counter to determine the particle number concentration. In the past several decades, there have been numerous extensive studies and developments on the DMA. Nonetheless, they are different in terms of specific applications, construction, particle size range, as well as time response and resolution. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art existing cylindrical DMAs for aerosol particle size classification as well as for the generation of monodisperse aerosol in nanometer size range. A description of the operating principles, detailed physical characteristics of these DMAs, including the single-channel and multi-channel DMAs, as well as some examples of applications to nanotechnology are given...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{pulmonary}} medicine, aerosolization {{of substances}} for continuous inhalation {{is confined to}} different classes of nebulizers with their inherent limitations. Among the unmet medical needs {{is the lack of}} an aerosolized surfactant preparation for inhalation by preterm neonates, to avoid the risks associated with endotracheal intubation and surfactant bolus instillation. In the present report, we describe a high-concentration continuous powder aerosolization system developed for delivery of inhalable surfactant to preterm neonates. Methods: The developed device uses a technique that allows efficient aerosolization of dry surfactant powder, generating a surfactant aerosol of high concentration. In a subsequent humidification step, the heated aerosol particles are covered with a surface layer of water. The wet surfactant aerosol is then delivered to the patient interface (e. g., nasal prongs) through a tube. Results: The performance characteristics of the system are given as mass concentration, dose rate, and size distribution of the generated <b>aerosol.</b> Continuous <b>aerosol</b> <b>flows</b> of about 0. 84 L/min can be generated from dry recombinant surfactant protein-C surfactant, with concentrations of up to 12 g/m 3 and median particle sizes of the humidified particles in the range of 3 to 3. 5 µm at the patient interface. The system has been successfully used in preclinical studies. Conclusion: The device with its continuous high-concentration delivery is promising for noninvasive delivery of surfactant aerosol to neonates and has the potential for becoming a versatile disperser platform closing the gap between continuously operating nebulizers and discontinuously operating dry powder inhaler devices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The 1 -dimentional {{model of}} aerosol process which {{includes}} a hot <b>aerosol</b> stream <b>flowing</b> through a tube with thermal gradients between the aerosols stream and the reactor cooled walls was developed to predict the aerosol formation, growth and thermophoretic deposition in high-temperature reactors. The mass and energy conservation equations were solved to determine the concentration and temperature profiles of the components. The model includes particle formation by nucleation, growth by coagulation, Brownian diffusion {{as well as the}} loss of aerosol particles by thermophoretic deposition on the cold reactor walls. The developed model results in the system of ordinary differential equations which were solved in SCILAB software...|$|R
