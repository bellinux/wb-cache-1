5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> understand object permanence, {{which explains why}} they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing {{at a place where}} it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E

25|$|Products {{often become}} more {{valuable}} with age. The term antique generally refers to manufactured items made over 100 years ago, although in some fields, such as antique cars, {{the time frame}} is less stringent. For antique furniture, the limit has traditionally been set in the 1830s. Collectors and dealers may use the word vintage to describe older collectables that <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> be called antiques, including Art Deco and Art Nouveau items, Carnival and Depression glass, etc. Items which were once everyday objects but may now be collectable, as almost all examples produced have been destroyed or discarded, are called ephemera.|$|E
25|$|Some {{individuals}} {{depend on}} herd immunity because they either cannot develop immunity or for medical reasons cannot be vaccinated. Newborn infants <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> receive many vaccines, either for safety reasons or because passive immunity renders the vaccine ineffective. Individuals who possess an immunodeficiency from HIV/AIDS, lymphoma, leukemia, {{a bone marrow}} cancer, an impaired spleen, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy may have lost any immunity that they previously had and vaccines may not be of any use for them because of their immunodeficiency. Vaccines are typically imperfect as some individuals' immune systems may not generate an adequate immune response to vaccines to confer long-term immunity, so a portion {{of those who are}} vaccinated may lack immunity. Lastly, vaccine contraindications for specific populations may prevent individuals in these populations from becoming immune. Individuals in one of these groups may be at a greater risk of developing complications from infection because of their medical status, so they generally rely on herd immunity more than others who can otherwise safely become immune via vaccination.|$|E

Burt travels to New York to surprise Kurt at Christmas in [...] "Glee, Actually", bringing Blaine with him, and the three spend Christmas together. During his visit, Burt reveals {{that he has been}} diagnosed with prostate cancer, but his chances of survival are very high as the diagnosis was made early and treatment appears to have been successful. Several months later, his doctor confirms that he is cancer free. During the season finale, he is approached by Blaine who wants his permission to marry Kurt. Burt tells him that he while he does understand why he wants to get married, he believes that both Blaine and his son <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> make that kind of step.|$|E

500|$|Still other {{arguments}} concern {{the origin and}} nature of the Joseph Smith Papyri. In response to criticism that the documents <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> have been written by Abraham, H. Donl Peterson argued that the papyri may be copies of an original which was either written or commissioned personally by Abraham, and thus the copies could be considered [...] "by [...] own hand" [...] {{in the sense that they}} were derived from an original. A similar argument proposed by Michael Rhodes is that the facsimiles that are found in the Book of Abraham represent a corrupted version of a document originally written by Abraham, and Smith gave the interpretation of the original document. Finally, Kevin Barney has proposed the idea that the facsimiles were not created by Abraham, but by a Jewish [...] many centuries later.|$|E
500|$|According to {{academic}} Brigid Cherry, nostalgia [...] "is a strong element of {{certain kinds of}} cult appeal." [...] When Veoh added many cult films to their site, they cited nostalgia as a factor for their popularity. Academic I. Q. Hunter describes cult films as [...] "New Hollywood in extremis" [...] and a form of nostalgia for that period. [...] Ernest Mathijs instead states that cult films use nostalgia {{as a form of}} resistance against progress and capitalistic ideas of a time-based economy. [...] By virtue of the time travel plot, Back to the Future permits nostalgia for both the 1950s and 1980s. [...] Many members of its nostalgic cult following <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> have been alive during those periods, which Emma Pett interprets as fondness for retro aesthetics, nostalgia for when they saw the film rather than when it was released, and looking to the past to find a better time period. [...] Similarly, films directed by John Hughes have taken hold in midnight movie venues, trading off of nostalgia for the 1980s and an ironic appreciation for their optimism. [...] Mathijs and Sexton describe Grease (1978) as a film nostalgic about an imagined past that has acquired a nostalgic cult following. [...] Other cult films, such as Streets of Fire (1984), create a new fictional world based on nostalgic views of the past. [...] Cult films may also subvert nostalgia, such as The Big Lebowski, which introduces many nostalgic elements and then reveals them as fake and hollow. [...] Author China Miéville praises the use of satire in Donnie Darko for its avoidance of falling into facile and comforting nostalgia, but Nathan Lee of the New York Sun identifies the retro aesthetic and nostalgic pastiche as factors in its popularity among midnight movie crowds.|$|E
2500|$|The sleeper serves {{mainly to}} keep the wearer warm at night, {{even in the absence}} of {{blankets}} and bed covers. [...] The sleeper covers the entire body except for the head (except in certain cases where a hood is present) and (in most cases) hands (except in cases where a sleeper has attached mitts, mostly on infant sizes), where it is snug at the neck and wrists. [...] The use of a zipper closure in place of buttons or snap fasteners also further retains warmth by eliminating drafts. [...] This is especially important for infants, for whom loose blankets may pose a safety hazard (including increasing the risk of SIDS), and possibly for older children, who may still be too young to be relied upon {{to keep the}}ir own sleepwear or bed covers adjusted so as to prevent exposure to the air of bare skin. [...] This is reflected in advertisements by blanket sleeper manufacturers, which often emphasize that their garments [...] "can't be kicked off", or that [...] "no other covers are needed". The permanently attached feet can also be a beneficial feature for children who are prone to get out of bed in the morning before their parents are awake, and <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> be relied upon to put on slippers or other footwear to keep their feet warm, as well as for adults who find putting on, and/or wearing socks in bed too bothersome, yet still want their feet covered when getting out of bed in the morning. [...] Blanket sleepers without feet allow more room for growth and reduce the possibility of slipping. [...] Also, children with larger or smaller feet find a better fit.|$|E
