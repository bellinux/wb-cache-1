40|$|The air-jet and {{ball-mill}} {{are frequently}} used in fine micronization of active pharmaceutical ingredients {{to the order}} of 1 – 5  μm, which is important for increasing dissolution rates, and also for pulmonary delivery. In this study, we investigated the ability of air-jet and ball-mill to achieve adequate micronization on the lab scale using a model soft material, Pluronic® F- 68. Material mechanical properties were characterized using the nanometer 600. Pluronic® F- 68 was ball-milled in a micro-mill at different material weights and durations in liquid nitrogen vapor. In comparison, a lab scale <b>air-jet</b> <b>mill</b> was used at various milling parameters according to a full factorial design, where the response factors were particle yield and particle size distribution, which was analyzed using laser diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The yield achieved with the micro-ball mill was 100 % but was ~ 80 % for the <b>air-jet</b> <b>mill,</b> which reduced the size of Pluronic® F- 68 from 70  μm to sizes ranging between 23 – 39  μm median diameters. Ball milling produced particles less than 10  μm after 15  min. Although air-jet milling proved capable of particle size reduction of the relatively soft material Pluronic® F- 68, limitations to the lower size range achievable were observed. The feed rate of the material into the air jet mill was a significant factor and slower feed rates lead to smaller sizes by allowing more time for particle collisions and subsequent particle breakage to occur. Micro-ball milling under cold condition was more successful at achieving a lower range particle size reduction of soft materials...|$|E

40|$|Wool powders {{with various}} {{particle}} sizes {{have been produced}} using different milling techniques. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed gradual breakdown of the fibre as it was progressively converted into powder form. Chlorination enhanced the effectiveness of subsequent <b>air-jet</b> <b>milling.</b> X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed {{an increase in the}} surface concentrations of oxygen and nitrogen, and a decrease in carbon and sulphur on conversion of the fibres into powders, as the cortex became exposed on the powder surface. An increased surface concentration of cysteic acid was observed for the chlorinated powder. Rapid uptake of dye by wool powders was observed in situations where there was virtually no uptake by the original fibre. Hydrophobic dyes were more readily sorbed than were hydrophilic dyes. The chlorination treatment led to a decrease in the sorption of acid dyes. Confocal microscopy, used in conjunction with a fluorescent stain, showed that chemicals were able to penetrate wool particles, even at room temperature. The rate and extent of uptake of dye by the finer powders were comparable to that obtained with activated charcoal, even though the surface area of the charcoal was 100 times greater. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{wool fibre}} has a complex morphology, {{consisting}} of an outer layer of cuticle scales surrounding an inner cortex. These two components {{are hard to}} separate effectively except by using harsh chemical treatments, {{making it difficult to}} determine the susceptibility of the different components of the fibre to photoyellowing. An approach to this problem based on mechanical fibre modification is described. To expose the inner cortex of wool to different degrees, clean wool fibres were converted into ‘powders’ of various fineness via mechanical chopping, <b>air-jet</b> <b>milling,</b> ball milling or their combination. Four types of powdered wool (samples A, B, C and D) were produced with reducing particle size distributions and an increasing level of surface damage as observed using SEM. Sample A contained essentially intact short fibre snippets and sample D contained a large amount of exposed cortical materials. Samples B and C contained a mixture of short fibre snippets and cortical materials. Solid wool discs were then compressed from the corresponding powder samples in a polished stainless steel die to enable colour measurement and UV irradiation studies. ATR-FTIR studies on powder discs demonstrated a small shift in the amide I band from 1644 cm− 1 for disc A to 1654 cm− 1 for disc D due to the different structures of the wool cuticle and cortex, in agreement with previous studies. Similarly an increase in the intensity ratio of the amide I to amide II band (1540 cm− 1) was observed for disc D, which contains a higher fraction of cortical material at the surface of the disc. Discs prepared from sample D appeared the lightest in colour before exposure and had the slowest photoyellowing rate, whereas discs made from powders A–C with a higher level of cuticle coverage were more yellow before exposure and experienced a faster rate of photoyellowing. This suggests that the yellow chromophores of wool may be more prevalent in cuticle scales, and that wool photoyellowing occurs to a greater extent in the cuticle than in the cortex. Photo-induced chemiluminescence measurements showed that sample D had a higher chemiluminescence intensity after exposure to UVA radiation and a faster decay rate than samples A and B. Thus one of the roles of the wool cuticle may be to protect the cortex by quenching of free radical oxidation during exposure to the UV wavelengths present in sunlight. <br /...|$|R
