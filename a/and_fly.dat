5|$|Divers are aquatic birds {{the size}} of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. They swim well <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> {{adequately}} but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land. They feed on fish and other aquatic animals.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) are heavy-bodied, strong-flying {{insects that}} hold their wings {{horizontally}} both in flight and at rest.

5|$|After France surrendered, Marcinkus {{managed to}} make his way to the French colonies in Africa (Morocco and Algeria). He decided to go to Great Britain and {{continue}} fighting, but the French army's terms of armistice at Compiègne and tensions between Britain and France made this difficult.

Marcinkus and some of his associates concocted a daring plan to commandeer several aircraft without authorization <b>and</b> <b>fly</b> to England. The plan was not executed due to increased security at airfields and other circumstances. He finally received the necessary documents enabling him to go to Britain in autumn of 1940.|$|E
