40|$|This study {{examines}} herding behavior and investment {{performance of the}} foreign investors in the Taiwan's stock market during extremely volatile periods. The finding shows that the target stocks actively traded by the foreign investors tend to go up or go down together {{as long as the}} foreign investors are inclined to purchase or sell the target stocks together during the extremely volatile periods. Besides, the target stocks are apt to move together with the market when the market rises sharply but are apt to deviate from the market when the market falls sharply. Furthermore, the <b>actual</b> <b>performances</b> of the foreign investors are positive in the daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly horizons, but are negative in the half-annually horizon during the extremely up periods. Moreover, the <b>actual</b> <b>performances</b> are positive in the all time horizons during the extremely down periods and the middle periods. In comparison with the market index, the <b>actual</b> <b>performances</b> outperform the market index only in the daily horizon during the extremely up periods, the <b>actual</b> <b>performances</b> outperform the market index in the all time horizons except for the half-annually horizon during the extremely down periods, and the <b>actual</b> <b>performances</b> beat the market index during the middle periods. 本研究探討外資在台灣股票市場於極端波動期間之群聚行為與投資績效。結果顯示，於市場極端波動期間，外資偏好之股票傾向同時上漲或同時下跌，且外資傾向同時買進或同時賣出。此外，於市場極端上漲期間，外資偏好之股票其漲幅與市場之漲幅一致，但在市場極端下跌期間，其跌幅會偏離市場之跌幅。另外，於市場極端上漲期間，外資之日、週、月及季之實際績效將為正，但外資半年之實際績效將為負。且於市場極端下跌與市場中間時期，外資各期之實際績效皆為正。在與市場指數作比較之後，於市場極端上漲期間，外資只有日之實際績效將打敗市場指數，且於市場極端下跌期間，外資除了半年之實際績效之外，其餘皆將打敗市場指數，再者，於市場中間期間，外資之各期之實際績效皆將打敗市場指數。 1.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the perceptions of the physics instructors, major-physics students, and nonmajor-physics students regarding <b>actual</b> teaching <b>performance</b> and effective teaching performance. The sample consisted of a total of 56 physics instructors, 120 major-physics students, and 120 nonmajor-physics students at eight public universities in Thailand. A total of 53 physics instructors or 94. 64 percent, 101 major-physics students or 84. 17 percent, and 107 nonmajor-physics students or 89. 17 percent responded in this study. Multivariate analysis of variance, univariate analysis, one-way analysis of variance, and multiple regression were used in the follow-up assessment, with the. 05 level of significance. The physics instructors, major-physics students, and nonmajor-physics students perceived <b>actual</b> teaching <b>performance</b> in class to be significantly different from effective teaching performance. The three groups rated <b>actual</b> teaching <b>performance</b> on every factor to be less than sffective teaching. There was a significant difference between the physics instructors' perceptions and the major-physics students' perceptions regarding <b>actual</b> teaching <b>performance,</b> and also there was a significant difference between the physics instructors' perceptions and the nonmajor-physics students' perceptions regarding <b>actual</b> teaching <b>performance.</b> However, there was no significant difference between major-and nonmajor-physics students' perceptions regarding <b>actual</b> teaching <b>performance.</b> There was no significant difference among the perceptions of the physics instructors, major-physics students, and nonmajor-physics students regarding effective teaching performance.

25|$|Conversely, perverse {{learning}} {{results in}} stagnating performance levels within an organization because it leads individuals {{to focus on}} improving their outcome in performance measures, rather than their <b>actual</b> <b>performance.</b> For example, teachers may often dedicate their efforts towards improving their students' test scores rather than their teaching style. Similar to positive learning, perverse learning leads to a decreased variability in measured performance levels, but this performance improvement is artificial.|$|E

25|$|In cooling mode, a heat pump's {{operating}} performance {{is described in}} the US as its energy efficiency ratio (EER) or {{seasonal energy efficiency ratio}} (SEER), and both measures have units of BTU/(h·W) (1 BTU/(h·W)= 0.293 W/W). A larger EER number indicates better performance. The manufacturer's literature should provide both a COP to describe performance in heating mode, and an EER or SEER to describe performance in cooling mode. <b>Actual</b> <b>performance</b> varies, however, and depends on many factors such as installation details, temperature differences, site elevation, and maintenance.|$|E

It is not even rigorously proved whether DFTs truly require Ω(NlogN) (i.e., order NlogN or greater) operations, even for the simple case of power of two sizes, although no algorithms with lower complexity are known.
