As the composite type <b>actuating</b> <b>element</b> is set by the axial vibration type <b>actuating</b> <b>element,</b> horizontal bending vibration type <b>actuating</b> <b>element</b> and vertical bending vibration type <b>actuating</b> <b>element</b> formed. The stator is an empty cylinder with a waist and tapered hole. In addition, the rotor {{is a kind of}} a hollow cone. It can be through the preload adjusting module to withstand the stator. As the preload adjusting module is set by the limit element, spring, washer and nut formed. While the shaft is a kind of cylinder with screw thread and stopper, it can pass through the piezoelectric stator, rotor and the preload adjusting module, making it a composite type piezoelectric motor. When we provide appropriate driving voltage, frequency, loading and phase angle to the piezoelectric stator, we can let the piezoelectric motor produces rapid rotation. Of course, we can also change through the driving phase angle, to change the direction of rotation of the piezoelectric motor. According to the experimental results, we found that its maximum speed and loading are 480 rpm and 2305 gw under conditions of 180 V p-p, 35 kHz and 0 0 driving phase angle.

40|$|Cantilever based metal-to-metal {{contact type}} MEMS series switch has many {{applications}} namely in RF MEMS, Power MEMS etc. A typical MEMS switch {{consists of a}} cantilever as <b>actuating</b> <b>element</b> to make the contact between the two metal terminals of the switch. The cantilever is pulled down by applying a pull-in voltage to the control electrode that is located below the middle portion of the cantilever while only the tip portion of the cantilever makes contact between the two terminals. Detailed analysis of bending of the cantilever for different pull-in voltages reveals some interesting facts. At low pull-in voltage the cantilever tip barely touches the two terminals, thus resulting in very less contact area. To increase contact area a very high pull-in voltage is applied, but it lifts the tip from the free end due to concave curving of the cantilever in the middle region of the cantilever where the electrode is located. Again it results in less contact area. Furthermore, the high pull-in voltage produces large stress {{at the base of}} the cantilever close to the anchor. Therefore, an optimum, pull-in voltage must exist at which the concave curving is eliminated and contact area is maximum. In this paper authors report the finding of optimum contact force and pull-in voltage. ...|$|E
