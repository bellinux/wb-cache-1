25|$|On 21 December 1978, Cessna 188 pilot Jay Prochnow radioed in a Mayday call to {{air traffic}} control. Prochnow, {{previously}} a {{pilot in the}} United States Navy, had lost his bearings on a flight from Pago Pago to Norfolk Island when his <b>Automatic</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Finder</b> (ADF) malfunctioned. At the same time, Gordon Vette was serving as captain of ANZ Flight 103 from Fiji to Auckland (with his first officer Arthur Dovey and flight engineer Gordon Brooks), making him the closest person to Prochnow that air traffic control could find. Vette agreed {{to help in the}} search for the lost Cessna.|$|E
25|$|The {{replacement}} of ground-based BTDF {{systems in the}} aviation role was due primarily to two factors. One was the move to ever-shorter wavelengths, which so shortened the required antennae that RDF could be carried out on a small aircraft receiver a few centimetres in length. Rotating loops were practical at these frequencies, and most aircraft used one. The second advance was {{the introduction of the}} <b>automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (ADF), which completely automated the RDF procedure. Once an ADF system was tuned to a station, either an airway beacon or an AM radio station, they continually moved a pointer to indicate the relative bearing with no further operator involvement.|$|E

50|$|Upon investigation, it was {{concluded}} that the crash had been caused primarily by negligence {{on the part of the}} flight crew. Customary investigations showed that the aircraft was in perfect condition for the flight, and that its mandatory periodic inspections had been properly conducted. It {{was concluded}} that the main factor for the accident was an error in reading the correct heading from the flight plan by the commander, compounded by the co-pilot copying the setting from the commander's panel instead of checking the flight plan. The fact that plan course 0270 asked for actually 027.0 degrees was due to the Varig standardization of flight planning for all its fleet, but only aircraft equipped with an inertial navigation system actually used headings with decimals. Despite the pilots having been told about this peculiarity in the airline's training program, the value expressed in the flight plan 0270 was interpreted by the commander as 270° (supposedly he was on vacation during the change of standard). This misinterpretation changed the general direction north-northeast (27°) to west (270°). The Boeing 737 was not equipped with INS, using only <b>automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> (ADF) and VOR.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of microwave <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> which operate under a variety of conditions and signal environments, but they can be divided into two major classes: (a) scanning, and (b) non-scanning. This paper discusses non-scanning multichannel amplitude-comparison systems, and in particular, systems using wide band antennas with crystal-video receivers to indicate the bearing of pulsed signals instantaneously. The accuracy of this type of <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> can be improved by increasing the number of channels. The characteristics of <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> in which there are more channels in the radio-frequency portion of the system than in the video portion were studied with an analogue of a <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b> The results of the analogue studies were applied in the development of an improved microwave antenna system for a tactical <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b> The construction and performance of this antenna system are discussed.

25|$|The {{aircraft}} departed McGhee Tyson Airport {{outside of}} Knoxville 27 minutes late {{on what was}} the second leg of the flight with seven passengers and three crew. The DC-3A was cleared for an approach to runway 27 at Tri-Cities Regional Airport. The visibility at the airport was 3 miles (4.8km) in light snow and fog with a 900-foot (274 m) broken ceiling and overcast at 1,700 feet (518 m). The crew reported problems with the <b>automatic</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> and {{they were unable to}} find the outer marker visually or aurally. The aircraft passed to the east of the outer marker and while outside the normal procedure turn area descended and hit the wooded slope on the north-west side of the Holston Mountain range, killing all 10 people on board.|$|E

500|$|The RAE also reconstructed {{about two-thirds}} of G-ALYP at Farnborough and found fatigue crack growth from a rivet hole at the {{low-drag}} fibreglass forward aperture around the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Finder,</b> which had caused a catastrophic break-up of the aircraft in high-altitude flight. [...] The punch rivet construction technique employed in the Comet's design had exacerbated its structural fatigue problems; the aircraft's windows had been engineered to be glued and riveted, but had been punch riveted only. Unlike drill riveting, the imperfect nature of the hole created by punch riveting could cause fatigue cracks to start developing around the rivet. Principal investigator Hall accepted the RAE's conclusion of design and construction flaws as the likely explanation for G-ALYU's structural failure after 3,060 pressurisation cycles. The Cohen inquiry closed on 24 November 1954, and although the inquiry had [...] "found that the basic design of the Comet was sound", de Havilland nonetheless began a refit programme to strengthen the fuselage and wing structure, employing thicker gauge skin and replacing all square windows and panels with rounded versions.|$|E

2500|$|Lady Be Good {{flew back}} alone from Italy on its return trip to its home base in Libya. At 12:12a.m. the pilot, Lt.

A subsequent search and rescue mission from Soluch Air Base failed to find any trace of the aircraft or its crew. The disappearance of the Lady Be Good became a mystery.|$|E
