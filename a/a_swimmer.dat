40|$|Purpose: Effects of {{drafting}} on the hydrodynamic and metabolic {{responses of}} the drafter behind and {{at the side of}} a passive and <b>an</b> active lead <b>swimmer</b> were related to the influence of <b>a</b> lead <b>swimmer</b> on the flow field of the draftee. Methods: Passive drag of the draft swimmer was compared for the nondrafting condition, in the drafting conditions behind a passive and <b>an</b> active lead <b>swimmer,</b> and at the side of a passive and <b>an</b> active lead <b>swimmer.</b> The effect was also evaluated with oxygen uptake measurements. Fluid pressure measurements were made behind and at the side of a passive and <b>an</b> active lead <b>swimmer</b> to examine the flow field. Results: Behind <b>a</b> passive lead <b>swimmer,</b> passive drag was significantly reduced by 20 %, and behind <b>an</b> active lead <b>swimmer,</b> it was reduced by 9 %. At the side of <b>a</b> passive lead <b>swimmer,</b> passive drag was significantly increased by 9 %, and at the side of <b>an</b> active lead <b>swimmer,</b> it increased by 8 %. Oxygen uptake was significantly reduced by 25 % behind <b>a</b> passive lead <b>swimmer,</b> by 11 % behind <b>an</b> active lead <b>swimmer,</b> and only marginally changed at the side of <b>a</b> lead <b>swimmer.</b> The pressure measurements indicated a 33 % decrease in mean flow velocity behind <b>an</b> active lead <b>swimmer</b> but <b>an</b> increase in peak flow velocities due to the kick of the lead swimmer. These increases could explain the lesser decrease in passive drag behind an active versus <b>a</b> passive lead <b>swimmer.</b> Conclusion: The best position for <b>a</b> draft <b>swimmer</b> was found to be directly behind <b>an</b> active lead <b>swimmer</b> at <b>a</b> distance of 0. 50 m between the toes of lead swimmer and the hands of drafter, with significant reductions in both passive drag and oxygen uptake when drafting. © 2009 The American College of Sports Medicine...|$|R

5|$|Haislett was {{the first}} American woman to defeat <b>a</b> <b>swimmer</b> from East Germany in the 100-meter {{freestyle}} since the 1972 Summer Olympics; she did so at the 1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle, Washington. At the 1991 World Aquatics Championships in Perth, Western Australia, Haislett won the 100-meter freestyle, and swam the anchor legs for the winning U.S. teams in the 4×100-meter freestyle and the 4×100-meter medley relays, ending the East German women's eighteen years of overwhelming dominance in the 100-meter freestyle at the world championships. Haislett also endured the emotional agony of disqualifying her team on an early exchange in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay – a relay race that the American women won in the water.|$|E

5|$|Tonelli {{retired after}} the Games. His aquatic success was not derived from any {{physical}} advantage, {{as he was}} relatively small for <b>a</b> <b>swimmer.</b> He was only 185cm tall and weighed 70kg, with relatively small hands and feet. Tonelli felt that his success was based around his ability to make fast starts from the blocks, and attributed his success to his mental approach {{and his ability to}} convert his energy into a fast swim in under one minute. He had a deliberate strategy of making himself nervous before the race, feeling that he thrived on pressure.|$|E

5|$|Aruba competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.

Two Arubans competed in the Olympic games: Jan Roodzant participated as <b>a</b> <b>swimmer,</b> and Fiderd Vis participated in judo. The Aruban delegation arrived in Beijing between August 1 and August 4, including the athletes, coaches, and various officials from both the IOC and the Aruban Olympic Committee (Comité Olimpico Arubano, COA), Aruba's local Olympic committee. Fiderd Vis came to Beijing on special invitation from the IOC, which had observed his progress while he trained in Brazil. Vis was the flagbearer in the opening ceremony, while Roodzant was so in the closing ceremony. Both athletes were eliminated in the preliminary rounds on August 12, 2008; consequently, Aruba did not earn any medals.|$|E
