25|$|Swiss doctor Paul Niehans, {{who was one}} of {{the fathers}} of {{cellular}} therapy, developed in 1931–1949 years the so-called Fresh cell therapy. Fresh cell therapy is mainly the use of live animal embryo organs cells which are injected into the patient with the purpose of achieving a revitalizing effect. These cells are generally extracted from sheep’s fetuses because in comparison to other animals, like pigs, rabbits and cows, sheep <b>are</b> <b>clean</b> animals and rarely contact diseases. Of course animal cells are not able to be included in human tissue, but they can secrete factors for rejuvenating. That's why this rejuvenation technology, despite the harsh criticism is practiced to this day.|$|E
25|$|The Malvern Roller Mill {{was added}} to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on August 4, 1995 because of its local {{significance}} in the areas of industry and commerce. The building operated as a grinding mill for farmers and the nearby community of Malvern from its construction until it closed in 1942. It is the only known mill in northwestern Illinois that retains all of its equipment for an all roller and no grindstone process. If the millrace and turbines <b>are</b> <b>clean</b> the mill could operate as it did when it was in business. The Malvern Roller Mill provides a glimpse at the complexity of late 19th century milling operations.|$|E

25|$|The {{isolated}} {{figures are}} given statuesque but largely unmodeled treatment, and their skin and their clothes <b>are</b> <b>clean,</b> with a waxy finish. They appear unselfconscious, {{at ease in}} their environment, and—with {{the possible exception of}} the boy to the bottom right—are locked in a pensive and solitary reverie. Horizontal and vertical lines at the middle and far distance contrast with arched backs and the relaxed postures of the figures toward the front. These postures, angles of heads, directions of gaze, and positions of limbs are repeated among the figures, giving the group a rhythmic unity. Distinctively coloured forms in close proximity, such as the grouping of horse-chestnut colours of the clothes on the bank, and the grouping of oranges of the boys in the water, add to the stability of the work—an effect reinforced in the cluster of shadows to the left on the bank, and the un-verisimilar play of light around the bathing figures.|$|E
25|$|Dental {{avulsion}} {{is a real}} dental {{emergency in}} which prompt management (within 20–40 minutes of injury) affects the prognosis of the tooth. The avulsed permanent tooth should be gently but well rinsed with saline, with care taken not to damage {{the surface of the}} root which may have living periodontal fiber and cells. Once the tooth and mouth <b>are</b> <b>clean</b> an attempt can be made to re-plant in its original socket within the alveolar bone and later splinted by a dentist for several weeks. Failure to re-plant the avulsed tooth within the first 40 minutes after the injury may result in a less favorable prognosis for the tooth. If the tooth cannot be immediately replaced in its socket, follow the directions for Treatment of knocked-out (avulsed) teeth and cold milk or saliva and take it to an emergency room or a dentist. If the mouth is sore or injured, cleansing of the wound may be necessary, along with stitches, local anesthesia, and an update of tetanus immunization if the mouth was contaminated with soil. Management of injured primary teeth differs from management of permanent teeth; avulsed primary tooth should not be re-planted (to avoid damage to the permanent dental crypt).|$|E
500|$|The Finnhorse is {{considered}} a reliable and fairly good jumper, and is regularly seen in [...] show jumping classes. Finnhorses have been quite successful at lower levels because they <b>are</b> <b>clean</b> and efficient jumpers, but their shorter stride at the canter and gallop keeps them from competing at more advanced levels. In his 1952 book Ratsastuskirja, Olympic rider Werner Walldén described the Finnhorse as enduring and resilient, mentally focused, and an easy keeper. He considered jumping to be the breed's best asset as a riding animal, but noted that its scope does not reach the level required for modern international competition.|$|E

[...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times called it [...] "a bravura first film, using the simplest means, yet managing to incorporate humor, pathos, suspense and even a well-articulated definition of basic human needs." [...] Dave Kehr from the Chicago Reader also gave a positive review, stating: [...] "The absence of dialogue ... is a cleverly executed stunt, {{but it is also}} an effective alibi for a technically proficient filmmaker who really has nothing to say. Another John Carpenter is born, which {{is by no means a}} bad thing." ...|$|E

40|$|Let R be a {{commutative}} local ring. It is {{proved that}} R is Henselian if {{and only if}} each R-algebra which is a direct limit of module finite R-algebras <b>is</b> strongly <b>clean.</b> So, the matrix ring Mn(R) <b>is</b> strongly <b>clean</b> for each integer n> 0 if R is Henselian and we show that the converse holds if either the residue class field of R is algebraically closed or R is an integrally closed domain or R is a valuation ring. It is also shown that each R-algebra which is locally a direct limit of module-finite algebras, <b>is</b> strongly <b>clean</b> if R <b>is</b> a π-regular commutative ring.
