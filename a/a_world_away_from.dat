5|$|After his release, he {{travelled}} to Schleswig-Holstein to join Baroness Gisela von Donner, {{an earlier}} acquaintance, on her estate {{and lived with}} her three children. During this time, Galland found work as a forestry worker. There he convalesced and came {{to terms with his}} career and alleged knowledge of Nazi war crimes. Galland began to hunt for the family and traded the kills in the local markets to supplement meagre meat rations. Soon Galland rediscovered his love of flying. Kurt Tank, the designer of the Fw 190, requested that he go to his home in Minden to discuss a proposal. Tank had been asked to work for the British and Soviets, and had narrowly avoided being forcibly kidnapped by the latter. Tank, through a contact in Denmark, informed Galland about the possibility of the Argentine Government employing him as a test pilot for Tank’s new generation of fighters. Galland accepted and flew to Argentina. He settled with Gisela in El Palomar, Buenos Aires. Galland enjoyed the slow life. His time there, aside from work commitments, was taken up with Gisela and the active Buenos Aires night life. Galland found South America <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> post-war shortages of Germany. Soon, he took up gliding again.|$|E

25|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of the Australian motoring community regarded the device as pseudoscience, and Brock's promotion of it drove away HDT drivers like John Harvey, Allan Moffat and Larry Perkins. Brock also recommended tyre pressures of 22psi (150kPa) for his polariser-equipped vehicles, a level which many regarded as near-dangerously low. Holden, fearing the consequences of being associated with the device and a resulting breakdown in communications over Brock's plans for new models, cut ties with Brock and set up an alternative racing/modification operation, Holden Special Vehicles. During this period, Brock also became involved in the importation and even the modification of the Lada Samara, a cheap Soviet-built hatchback <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the high-performance V8-powered Commodores he was famous for. The Lada deal came at the right time for the Brock organisation as it saved the struggling outfit from potential bankruptcy.|$|E

25|$|Africa was intimately tied to {{the economy}} of the Caribbean. Responsible for fueling the sailors that pirates preyed on, the sugar {{plantations}} of the Caribbean, and the mainland colonies of Spain and Britain, traffic from Africa was routinely targeted by pirates. On numerous occasions, mutinous slave ship crews turned pirate. Bartholomew Roberts wreaked havoc for traders of all goods on the west coast of Africa. One of the earliest rumored places where pirates collected was on the island of Madagascar, off the East coast of Africa. This was their base of operations for their pecking of the Mogul Empire. Here they could prey on the successes of the East India Companies while being <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> any authority. These are the same outlaws that were plundering the West Indies. The English pirate Avery, or Henry Every plundered a Mogul ship, gaining immense wealth. Avery was said to have settled on Madagascar and was never heard from again, though it was rumored he retired in Ireland. Some writers speculate that this event put in motion a series of events that would help lead to the multitude of laws passed for decades to come.|$|E

It was the highest rated show on the Fox Network that week. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: [...] "Certain scenes of this, the most syrupy of Simpsons episodes, sent viewers raised on the later seasons scurrying to the bathroom.

Sinnott praised the faster pace and the design changes that made it feel [...] "fresh", as well as Eccleston's Doctor. However, he felt that Piper only did a [...] "credible" [...] job as Eccleston eclipsed her, and said that the writing was [...] "uneven" [...] with many of the episodes [...] "just slightly flawed". Looking back on the series in 2011, Stephen Kelly of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Eccleston's Doctor may have had many faults– looking like an EastEnders extra and bellowing [...] "FANTASTIC!" [...] at every opportunity being two of them– but he was merely a reflection of a show that, at the time, still didn't know what it wanted to be. The first series of the revived Doctor Who– which featured farting aliens– was <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the intelligent, populist science-fiction we know it as now.

500|$|Erin Martin of PopMatters {{said that}} [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] had euphoric properties.

This song just feels good to listen to". She {{also noted that the}} song was central to the concept and [...] "love-spreading message [...] Guetta delivers on the album as a whole." [...] David Balls of Digital Spy agreed with the song's anthem credentials. [...] " [...] is further evidence that Rowland may no longer be resigned to living in Beyoncé [...] shadow. Fusing classic dance beats with a heady, emotionally charged vocal, it's <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the mid-tempo R numbers with which she started her solo career. In fact, this packs a punch from the very first listen, meaning it could well become one of the summer anthems of 2009." [...] However, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was less impressed than the other critics, simply noting the song as [...] "a cheesy synthpop makeover of Coldplay's 'Clocks'." [...] Wood did however state that it was among Guetta's best work and was an example of when the DJ is [...] "most commercial".|$|E

[...] Steven Murphy, editor for Inside Soap, urged the magazine's readers to watch Redwater, despite previous soap spin-offs, such as Ricky & Bianca or Coronation Street: Open All Hours, being unmemorable, because [...] "It's mysterious, moody and dramatic—and looks stunning by making the best of its gorgeous Irish location." [...] Fiona Sturges from The Guardian said, [...] "There is—improbable as it sounds—a degree of suspense here, not to say proper acting. The problem is that whenever Kat and Alfie appear—he the well-meaning idiot, she the wounded fishwife—the spell is broken. The BBC is trying to sell this as Broadchurch meets The Wicker Man, {{but the reality is}} more NCSI: Ballykissangel. I love Kat and Alfie, but the quicker they get back to Albert Square, the better."

40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{conditions}} for a second wave of industrial dynamics of forestry rich regions in old industrialised nations which in the past contributed to the industrial competitiveness but today find themselves in the periphery of industrial development. The main argument is that the process of globalisation and climate change mitigations combined create a scramble for biomass and that this provide a golden opportunity for a revival of the industrial base of forest rich regions. In the 21 th century bioenergy applications and new biomaterials based on the properties of boreal trees are emerging in Scandinavia. These resources in combination with new technology can contribute with advanced materials and solutions in <b>a</b> <b>world</b> moving <b>away</b> <b>from</b> fossils. This emerging paradigm has some of the infrastructure already at place – i. e. pulp mills that for decades have been used for papermaking. At least to 2020, the scramble for bioenergy solutions might be a second best alternative in the climate change mitigation in order to reach the European policy goals. Considering our findings this might restrict the potential for biomass pathways with higher potential both from carbon sequestration and industrial development perspectives. Index Terms—Climate change; peripheral regions; old industrialised resource rich nations; industrial dynamics. I...|$|R
60|$|That {{incident}} {{was the only}} reason that Mirah herself could have stated for the hidden sadness which Hans had divined. Of one element in her changed mood she could have given no definite account: it was something as dim as the sense of approaching weather-change, and had extremely slight external promptings, such as we are often ashamed to find all we can allege in support of the busy constructions that go on within us, not only without effort, but even against it, under the influence of any blind emotional stirring. Perhaps the first leaven of uneasiness was laid by Gwendolen's behavior on that visit which was entirely superfluous as a means of engaging Mirah to sing, and could have no other motive than the excited and strange questioning about Deronda. Mirah had instinctively kept the visit a secret, but the active remembrance of it had raised a new susceptibility in her, and made her alive as she had never been before to the relations Deronda must have with that society which she herself was getting frequent glimpses of without belonging to it. Her peculiar life and education had produced in her an extraordinary mixture of unworldliness, with knowledge of the world's evil, and even this knowledge was a strange blending of direct observation with the effects of reading and theatrical study. Her memory was furnished with abundant passionate situation and intrigue, which she never made emotionally her own, but felt a repelled aloofness from, as she had done from the actual life around her. Some of that imaginative knowledge began now to weave itself around Mrs. Grandcourt; and though Mirah would admit no position likely to affect her reverence for Deronda, she could not avoid a new painfully vivid association of his general life with <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her own, where there might be some involvement of his feeling and action with a woman like Gwendolen, who was increasingly repugnant to her--increasingly, even after she had ceased to see her; for liking and disliking can grow in meditation as fast as in the more immediate kind of presence. Any disquietude consciously due to the idea that Deronda's deepest care might be for something remote not only from herself but even from his friendship for her brother, she would have checked with rebuking questions:--What was she but one who had shared his generous kindness with many others? and his attachment to her brother, was it not begun late to be soon ended? Other ties had come before, and others would remain after this had been cut by swift-coming death. But her uneasiness had not reached that point of self-recognition in which she would have been ashamed of it as an indirect, presumptuous claim on Deronda's feeling. That she or any one else should think of him as her possible lover was a conception which had never entered her mind; indeed it was equally out of the question with Mrs. Meyrick and the girls, who with Mirah herself regarded his intervention in her life as something exceptional, and were so impressed by his mission as her deliverer and guardian that they would have held it an offense to him at his holding any other relation toward her: a point of view which Hans also had readily adopted. It is a little hard upon some men that they appear to sink for us in becoming lovers. But precisely to this innocence of the Meyricks was owing the disturbance of Mirah's unconsciousness. The first occasion could hardly have been more trivial, but it prepared her emotive nature for a deeper effect from what happened afterward.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a change}} in the {{paradigm}} of architecture and the approach toward the development of forms. A change that strives to get past the shallow ascetic of Post modernism and its view of architects as the generators of forms whose priority is appearance not performance. This change continues the movement <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the shallow facade of Post modernism toward a priority of performance and accuracy in architecture. By this, I mean an architecture that serves its users better, and attempts to accurately address the issues 2 ̆ 6 needs of the user. While performance based design is not a new concept, it can be applied in a way never possible before. The age of computation in architecture and its part that it plays in the design process is continually changing. It continues to become less a tool used to draw and more a integral part in the development of design and the direct form of architecture. With the quick implementation of these tools into specific bits and pieces of the design process there is still a gap between its current uses and its potential. This potential is what this project strives to explore. In <b>a</b> <b>world</b> moving <b>away</b> <b>from</b> shallow ascetic and toward performative space, how can architects produce a more accurate 2 ̆ 6 performative architecture?

50|$|Mann's films often feature male protagonists, usually highly {{gifted and}} independent-minded {{professionals}} who struggle to reconcile their mental lives with the demands, both benign and malign, of the exterior world. Importantly, his films often involve a tragic {{rather than a}} happy ending, such as in Miami Vice, when of the two undercover police officers, one has his girlfriend (also an undercover officer) {{come out of a}} coma and the other tearfully separates from his romantic interest. Mann's films contain fast-paced, artful scenes that strongly depend on powerful music, where often two opposing sides intermix, such as undercover policework and undercover drug trafficking, so {{that it is hard to}} distinguish between the two. For example, in Heat, the police detective invites the criminal to meet for coffee, where they discuss their affairs like old business partners. Often it is hard to distinguish between opposing sides (police vs. criminals, etc.), where the actions, dress, and mannerisms of the characters are extremely similar. Also, Mann's work often involves landscapes and modes where the heroic protagonists occupy <b>a</b> somewhat secret <b>world,</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> ordinary concerns (law, life and death, money, daily-life survival duties, family duties, and so on), where the secret world may or may not coincide with ordinary reality. Protagonists often find impassioned romantic interests which are severed under tragic situations near the end of the film (Last of the Mohicans, Heat, Collateral, Miami Vice, Public Enemies). Overall, Mann's films mix artistry (via music, stylishness and emotional intensity) with strong violence and noir-like stoicism.|$|R

Arguably the most suitable location to generate this electricity is at the source of consumption. Placing solar panels on unused rooftop space can subsidize the electricity demand that that building requires. This research quantifies the amount of electricity that can be generated within the City of Waterloo, Ontario. Using Natural Resources Canada data, examples from the literature and existing rooftop solar data, a range of possible values were calculated to illustrate the generating potential rooftop solar panels could have for the City of Waterloo. The range in values illustrated the overall potential of electricity generation from rooftop solar power under best to worst case scenarios. An overall value was then calculated based on total available area for five different land use types to illustrate the potential each sector could have for the City. Additionally, a range of values was also applied to the largest and cumulative average rooftop size for each land use type to further examine potential based on each land use type. This research is intended to serve as a possible template for similar studies in different geographic areas of Ontario as well as to influence future policy development surrounding renewable energy generation...|$|R
40|$|For the French writer Paul Valéry, the Mediterranean {{was a kind}} of “pre-Europe”; it {{produced}} the European man, universal man, Protagoras’s man as the measure of all things; on its shores, peoples and cultures mixed, exchanging blows and trade. Writing from Algeria, Albert Camus saw the inhabitant of a Mediterranean city as having greater affinity with the inhabitants of any other place on the Mediterranean coast (such as Genoa, or Mallorca) than with a citizen of Alsace. The Bosnian-born Predrag Matvejević writes that the Mediterranean is at once <b>a</b> <b>world</b> to itself and the centre of the world. For the Turkish writer Halikarnas Balıkçısı it is itself a continent, separate from Africa, Asia, or Europe. It has been called by some a liquid continent, by others a lake of cultures; more a bridge than an obstacle or a boundary. For the Catalan Manuel Vázquez Montalbán – more of a pessimist, cynical satirist {{than any of the other}} writers mentioned so far – the Mediterranean has been a succession of barbarisms that have accumulated and mixed until they produced the hybrid Mediterranean man, who eats oil, olives and aubergines. Matvejević also points out that if the Mediterranean sea is a sponge full of knowledge, it is also full of shipwrecks. Indeed. From Odysseus’s lost ships and shipmates to Aeneas’ journey as a refugee from burning Troy (Dido too, of course, was a refugee), to the refugees and asylum seekers and “economic migrants” of the present, the Mediterranean is still crossed by people who seek to escape violence and destruction, who search for a better life. The fate of Azel in Leaving Tangier, by the Moroccan Tahar Ben Jelloun, or of Anpalagan Ganeshu in The Ghosts of Portopalo by the Sardinian Giovanni Maria Bellu – real and imagined characters who seek entrance to what has been called, with sinister echoes of the Wehrmacht’s Festung Europa, “Fortress Europe” – is <b>a</b> whole <b>world</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> that of Aeneas, chosen to found and Empire that would unify the Mediterranean and Europe. Matvejević says that, unlike in Europe, the centres of the Mediterranean are cities, not states or nations. Comparative Literature has often been criticized in recent years – it has even been declared dead, or compromised – for its Eurocentrism and its origins in European nationalism. In my paper I want to ask, what can a Mediterranean perspective offer to Comparative Literature today, and to a reassessment of its history...|$|R
5000|$|Arriving at Birdopia, Gian and Suneo are {{captured}} by crow soldiers {{and brought to}} the vulture Commander Seagrid, who plans execution for them. Meanwhile, Doraemon, Nobita, and Shizuka find Gusuke near the owl Professor Hou's house after fleeing from the same crow soldiers {{with the help of}} an ostrich taxi service. Hou explains that Birdopia is <b>a</b> <b>world</b> existed far <b>away</b> <b>from</b> human <b>world</b> and is connected only during bird migration, which are guarded by Bird Migration Patrolling Troops. Seagrid was once a member of the troops, but he was shot by humans and retired shortly, seeking vengeance at them. After Hou advises them to take cover as not many liked humans in Birdopia, Doraemon brings [...] "Bird Hats" [...] which can sprout wings by wearing them, with him as a pigeon, Nobita a duck, and Shizuka a swan. The three and Gusuke manage to stage a rescue of Gian and Suneo shortly thereafter, and Doraemon gives them Bird Hats of an albatross and a woodpecker respectively. Gusuke informs Nobita and his friends that there will be an annual competition, [...] "Rally Icarus", which is used to recruit members of the Patrolling Troops, and that they should join it. During a dinner with Gusuke's parents and his friend, Milk, Gusuke confesses that he is actually adopted and that he is unable to fly naturally due to the trauma of falling he got before being founded. Meanwhile, Hou translates an ancient Birdopia tablet which contains information about Phoenicia, an ancient dragon-like being who can bring destruction to the world. The captain of the crow soldiers reports to Seagrid after overhearing it, after which Seagrid kidnaps Hou for the location of Phoenicia so he will be able to use it to destroy humanity.|$|R
