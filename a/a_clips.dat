5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with shots of New York City, and then has Hamasaki on a rooftop. Hamasaki is then singing the track with several different camera angles circulating her and the city. During the first verse, it has her in an apartment, sitting on a couch with a butterfly hair clip; this scene is used throughout the entire video. It then has three shots of her in different clothes; one with a brown leather jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat, the second with a red dress on, and the third with a black jacket and crop hair style. The shot {{with her in the}} brown leather jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat then shows her on a rooftop singing the song. The final pre-chorus and chorus has her driving through New York City, and has her in a pink dress watching the snow fall; it ends with her in the red dress, holding her hands out for the snow to fall. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: <b>A</b> <b>Clips</b> (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of <b>A</b> <b>Clips</b> Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016).|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi, and uses a shorten version of Peters' remix. The visual portrays Hamasaki in a dark laboratory, being surrounded by keyboards, electronic devices and a black bird. Throughout the music video, several people start to wear headphones and follow Hamasaki, with them eventually starting {{to listen to the}} song and observing TV monitors of the singer. Each person, including Hamasaki, wears black eye shadow on one eye, and a code on their hand. Over the clip, the singer is seen singing to the recording in the laboratory, with interspersed scenes portraying her wearing the outfit used for the single's artwork. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki, includingA Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), and the digital release of <b>A</b> <b>Clips</b> Complete (2014).|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with a title screen of the song and Hamasaki's name. It then shows a boy looking towards the camera, until shifting to Hamasaki wearing a colorful outfit whilst surrounded by star-like shapes. The boy walks through the stars whilst Hamasaki sings the song; the second look is inspired by the artwork of [...] "To Be". He opens a case that holds a kaleidoscope and looks through it, seeing various versions of Hamasaki in different colored outfits and wigs singing the song. All these scenes start to re-appear {{throughout the rest of}} the song, and ends with a black and white image of Hamasaki, apparently cracked in the kaleidoscope, which then has the boy looking upset. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: <b>A</b> <b>Clips</b> (2000), a self-titled DVD (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of <b>A</b> <b>Clips</b> Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016).|$|E
25|$|Occasionally Sullivan would {{feature a}} Hollywood actor {{introducing}} <b>a</b> <b>clip</b> from <b>a</b> film {{in which he}} or she currently starred. Burt Lancaster made an appearance in 1962, speaking about Robert Stroud, the character he portrayed in Birdman of Alcatraz, and introducing <b>a</b> <b>clip</b> from the film. And although Olivier personally did not appear on the show, in 1966 Sullivan showed <b>a</b> <b>clip</b> from the Laurence Olivier Othello, the film version of which was then currently showing in New York.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>clipped</b> {{compound}} word {{is actually}} a type of blend word. Like other blends, clipped compounds may be made {{of two or more}} components. However, a blend may have a meaning independent of its components' meanings (e.g., motel <— motor + hotel), while in <b>a</b> <b>clipped</b> compound the components already serve the function of producing a compound meaning (for instance, pulmotor <— pulmonary + motor). In addition, <b>a</b> <b>clipped</b> compound may drop one component completely: hard instead of hard labor, or mother for motherfucker (a process called ellipsis). Laurie Bauer suggests the following distinction: If the word has the compound stress, it is <b>a</b> <b>clipped</b> compound; if it has a single-word stress, it is blend.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{versions}} of the intro to this song. In most cases, it starts with <b>a</b> <b>clip</b> from <b>a</b> Victor Lundberg speech called “An Open Letter to My Teenage Son.” The other is <b>a</b> <b>clip</b> from the documentary Heavy Metal Parking Lot.|$|R
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. Because the music video {{was part of the}} trilogy set with [...] "Vogue" [...] and [...] "Far Away", only a portion of the song was shot for the video.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. This is Takeishi's first video collaboration with Hamasaki since [...] "Trust". The overall appearance of the video {{was inspired by the}} cover sleeve of [...] "Whatever", which also featured Hamasaki in an angel costume. Several photoshoot out takes were considered to be released in the CD single, but Avex restricted this. Because of this, only two photos of Hamasaki in the angel costume were distributed; one for the front cover, and one for the back. The music video also appeared on Hamasaki's DVD compilation box sets: <b>A</b> <b>Clips,</b> her self-titled video compilation (2000), Complete Clip Box (2004), A Clip Box 1998–2011 (2011), and the bonus DVD version with A Complete: All Singles.|$|E

5000|$|The EBN {{modus operandi}} {{was to take}} cable {{television}} broadcasts and remix them with a funky beat, often having the lyrics [...] "sung" [...] not by a singer but by half-second sound clips from TV, spliced together. For example, the lyric [...] "electronic behavior control system" [...] would be created with <b>a</b> <b>clip</b> of Ross Perot saying [...] "electronic", followed by <b>a</b> <b>clip</b> of George H. W. Bush saying [...] "behavior", then Ted Koppel saying [...] "control", and finally <b>a</b> <b>clip</b> of Bill Clinton saying [...] "system". This technique has been named video scratching.|$|R

500|$|According to Ratner, Myers was not {{comfortable}} with these scenes, as {{he felt it was}} too sexual and inappropriate; he even asked him to cut that particular shot. Madonna on the other hand, thought it was fun and convinced the director to keep it. The video ends with one of Powers' fantasies, him proclaiming [...] "It's good to be me!" [...] as Madonna playfully strokes his cheek. Author Georges Claude Guilbert wrote in his book, Madonna as Postmodern Myth, that [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] denoted one of the series of looks reinvented by Madonna around that time, and was a [...] "radical" [...] change from the geisha look of her previous video for [...] "Nothing Really Matters", released the same year. Matthew Rettenmund wrote in his Encyclopedia Madonnica that [...] "Madonna probably gave very little thought [...] " [...] but he felt that it was better than being a [...] "couple of steps above <b>a</b> <b>clips</b> compilation".|$|E
500|$|Although he {{normally}} hates clip shows, David Mirkin {{liked this}} episode {{because of the}} singing and dancing and called the clips [...] "truly wonderful". The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote [...] "for <b>a</b> <b>clips</b> show, it's not bad. The only one missing really is [...] "Dr Zaius" [...] from [...] "A Fish Called Selma". In his book Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner wrote, [...] "when songs spring up one at a time, you might notice a clever line or two, or {{the way that they}} serve the same kind of plot-advancing or energy-generating purposes they do in Singin' in the Rain or Cats, but piled together in , they amount to a sort of Simpsonian side project: Springfield: The Musical. And ... it's a very impressive side project at that." [...] The episode was nominated for a 1998 Emmy Award, in the [...] "Music Direction" [...] category. [...] A review of The Simpsons season 9 DVD release in the Daily Post noted that it includes [...] "super illustrated colour commentaries" [...] on [...] "All Singing, All Dancing" [...] and [...] "Lost Our Lisa". Isaac Mitchell-Frey of the Herald Sun cited the episode as a [...] "low moment" [...] of the season, noting it [...] "recycles parts of previous episodes".|$|E
