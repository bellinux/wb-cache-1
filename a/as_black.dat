5|$|Warning {{coloration}} {{can succeed}} either through inborn behaviour (instinct) {{on the part}} of potential predators, or through a learned avoidance.

5|$|World-class {{match play}} (i.e., {{a series of}} games between the same two opponents) often {{involves}} one or both players preparing one or two openings very deeply, and playing them repeatedly during the match. Preparation for such a match also involves analysis of those opening lines known to be played by the opponent. Fischer had been famous for his unusually narrow opening repertoire: for example, almost invariably playing 1. as White, and almost always playing the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defence <b>as</b> <b>Black</b> against 1.e4. He surprised Spassky by repeatedly switching openings, and by playing openings that he had never, or only rarely, played before (such as 1. as White, and Alekhine's Defence, the Pirc Defence, and the Paulsen Sicilian <b>as</b> <b>Black).</b> Even in openings that Fischer had played before in the match, he continually deviated from the variations he had previously played, almost never repeating the same line twice in the match.|$|E

5|$|A special {{relativistic}} redshift formula (and its classical approximation) {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such <b>as</b> <b>black</b> holes and Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using general relativity. Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer).|$|E

These, along with {{the widespread use of}} sugar or honey, gave many dishes a sweet-sour flavour.
