5|$|In a squad {{with much}} less star power than that {{sent to the}} Tour de France, they were again {{middle of the pack}} in the team time trial, {{finishing}} 11th of 22 teams. The squad did not show themselves much, as it was not until stage 10 that they so much as finished in the top ten on a stage. Phinney took fifth place in the stage 10 individual time trial, <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> a half off the pace of the day's winner Tony Martin. Frank rode to fourth from a breakaway in the next stage, again <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> a half off the pace of the day's winner, this time David Moncoutié. All the team had to show for itself from {{the second half of the}} Vuelta was a seventh place from Van Avermaet in the field sprint finish to stage 12. Six BMC riders reached the Vuelta's finish, with Van Avermaet in 83rd place being their highest overall finisher.|$|E
5|$|The stage 20 {{individual}} {{time trial}} {{was to be}} the Tour's final competitive stage, since its final stage is traditionally mostly ceremonial and only competitive at the sprint finish. Voeckler's position was likely secure, being <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 13 seconds behind Evans and <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 21 seconds ahead of Damiano Cunego, both time gaps unlikely to be recouped due to Voeckler's and Cunego's limited time trial skills. However, Rolland's position as best young rider remained in play due to his minute and 33 seconds advantage over Taaramäe, and Taaramäe's time trial abilities well superior to Rolland's. Rolland rode one of the best time trials of his career to finish 21st. Taaramäe finished tenth, and took back 47 seconds, but it was insufficient to take back the white jersey. Eight of the nine Team Europcar riders completed the Tour, with the lone exception being Kern who had crashed out of stage 5. Voeckler finished fourth overall and Rolland tenth as the best young rider.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> <b>and</b> some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, {{the course of the war}} had gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had {{achieved}} spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria.|$|E

5|$|Los Angeles lost in {{the finals}} to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points. Down by 16 {{entering}} the fourth quarter, and 10 with <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> a half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments which fell just short. After dropping to 36 wins and losing {{in the first round}} of the 1967 NBA Playoffs, they {{lost in the}} finals to the Celtics again in 1968. Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.|$|E
5|$|Malvern {{water is}} a natural spring water from the Malvern Hills {{on the border of}} the {{counties}} of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in England. The Hills consist of very hard granite and limestone rock. Fissures in the rock retain rain water, which slowly permeates through, escaping at the springs. The springs release an average of about 60 litres <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> the flow has never been known to cease.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{appeared}} in other {{television and radio}} shows, including Just <b>a</b> <b>Minute</b> <b>and,</b> from 1992 until 1998, {{playing the role of}} GamesMaster in the television show of the same name: a character who professed to know {{everything there is to know}} about video gaming. He would issue video game challenges and answered questions on cheats and tips. The show's host, Dominik Diamond, claimed that Moore did not understand anything that he said on the show, yet managed to record his contributions in single takes.|$|E

5|$|When submerged, a crocodilian's {{heart rate}} slows {{down to one}} or two beats <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> <b>and</b> blood flow to the muscles is reduced. When it rises and takes a breath, its heart rate speeds up in seconds, and the muscles receive newly oxygenated blood. Unlike many marine mammals, {{crocodilians}} have little myoglobin to store oxygen in their muscles. During diving, muscles are supplied with oxygen when an increasing concentration of bicarbonate ions causes haemoglobin in the blood to release oxygen.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} most of the top riders in the GC, paced by the race leader himself, caught every one of the twelve initial leaders, and {{subsequently}} Garzelli just before the day's last climb, Prà Martino. Di Luca's aggressive descent of Prà Martino gave him a gap over the elite group of riders who had been able to hold his wheel to that point, and the stage win. The day saw a big winner in time gains and a big loser: Lance Armstrong finished 29 seconds behind Di Luca in the same group as the man finishing sixth on the stage, gaining seven places in the GC, while Thomas Lövkvist lost over <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> fell from second to eighth in the GC.|$|E
5|$|After two {{consecutive}} third-place finishes, Martin was victorious in 2011, beating Bradley Wiggins and defending champion Cancellara by <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> fifteen seconds. He retained the rainbow jersey the following year; however, {{the margin of}} victory was considerably smaller as he beat the American Taylor Phinney by five seconds. In 2013, Martin won the event for a third consecutive time, again overcoming Wiggins and Cancellara. After two runner-up finishes, Wiggins prevented Martin's fourth successive win in the following season, taking the world title for the first time. Wiggins decided not {{to take part in}} 2015, focusing instead on breaking the hour record. In his absence, the winner was Belarussian cyclist Vasil Kiryienka, who came in third to Martin in 2012, beating Italy's Adriano Malori and France's Jérôme Coppel.|$|E

5|$|Playing floorball in the off-season, Salo tore his {{achilles tendon}} on 22 July 2010. After {{undergoing}} surgery, he was sidelined {{for the first}} four months of the 2010–11 season. The injury was so severe that Salo later admitted thinking his career was over during his rehabilitation. Before returning to the Canucks lineup, he was sent to the team's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose, for a conditioning assignment. Making his AHL debut on 4 February 2011, he scored two goals for the Moose in a 3–2 win against the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. Salo played two more games for the Moose, going pointless in both, before being called up by the Canucks on 11 February. Salo appeared in 27 games in 2010–11, recording three goals and four assists. During the first and second rounds of the 2011 playoffs, Salo missed four games with a leg injury. The Canucks eliminated the Blackhawks and Nashville Predators in the first two rounds to qualify for the Western Conference Finals against the San Jose Sharks. During Game 4 of the series, Salo set a Canucks playoff record for fastest back-to-back goals, scoring 16 seconds apart on a pair of 5-on-3 powerplays. The feat also tied Larry Murphy's NHL record for fastest two power play goals in the playoffs since 1957. Combined with Ryan Kesler's goal <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> thirty-nine seconds previously, the trio of goals were also the fastest scored in Canucks playoff history at <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> fifty-five seconds. Vancouver {{went on to win the}} game 4–2, while winning the series 4–1. Advancing to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, the Canucks were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins. During the off-season, Salo re-signed with the Canucks to a one-year, $2 million deal on 1 July 2011, prior to becoming an unrestricted free agent.|$|E
5|$|Stage 12 into Briançon in France was the Giro's first high {{mountain}} stage, and it shook up the standings {{for the final}} time. Di Luca took the stage win, twice attacking from an elite group of five that had made the climb together. As Noè finished nearly ten minutes behind, Di Luca took the pink jersey for a third time, while still holding the green jersey. As Di Luca concentrated on winning the race overall, Piepoli took the green jersey after stage 15, the race's queen stage, topping two of that stage's climbs in first position. His lead in the mountains classification quickly became unassailable, and he won the jersey in Milan. It was also on this stage that 's Eddy Mazzoleni distinguished himself as a podium contender, taking <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> a half out of Di Luca to move into second overall. Schleck lost time to Di Luca and Mazzoleni, but gained time over other riders {{in the top of}} the overall standings and stood third overall.|$|E
5|$|Swordfishs diving {{depth and}} time {{are not known}} because the records from her sea trials have not survived. Shutting down her boiler, {{retracting}} the funnel and sealing the boiler uptake required about <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> a quarter, which included switching over to the electric motors. In marked contrast to contemporary Vickers designs much {{attention was paid to}} safety arrangements, including her extensive subdivision. Indicator and telephone buoys, which could be released from inside the submarine were provided together with external air connections and a charged high-pressure line which could provide air to any manned compartment or the living spaces. Furthermore, the main ballast tanks could be blown from either end of the ship.|$|E

5|$|The Road World Championships {{took place}} in Cancellara's native country Switzerland and he stated that he wished to win both events. Cancellara {{dominated}} the time trial event and won {{by a margin of}} close <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> a half over the second-place finisher. This was Cancellara's third world championship in the time trial discipline, which was tied for most ever with Australia's Michael Rogers. Cancellara's next goal was the road race, which was to take place three days later. During the final lap of the race, Cancellara crossed the gap to the race's leading group that had just formed. At the bottom of the final climb Cadel Evans (Australia) attacked, but no other riders reacted. Cancellara crossed the line in fifth.|$|E
5|$|The body cavity {{contains}} the circulatory or haemal system. The vessels form three rings: one around the mouth (the hyponeural haemal ring), another around the digestive system (the gastric ring) {{and the third}} near the aboral surface (the genital ring). The heart beats about six times <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> is {{at the apex of}} a vertical channel (the axial vessel) that connects the three rings. At the base of each arm are paired gonads; a lateral vessel extends from the genital ring past the gonads to the tip of the arm. This vessel has a blind end and there is no continuous circulation of the fluid within it. This liquid does not contain a pigment and has little or no respiratory function but is probably used to transport nutrients around the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} of this work, {{published}} in 1861, was received so favourably that the author has felt bound to bestow his utmost care upon <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> thorough revision of his book, {{in the hope of}} bringing up the information it contains to the existing state of knowledge. In this endeavour he has been assisted as well by Canon Lightfoot, to whom he is indebted for that section of the third chapter which treats of Egyptian versions of the New Testament (pp. 319-357), as also by much unsought for and most welcome help, especially {{on the part of those}} scholars who are named in p. 164, note. Without wishing to speak harshly of writers who are not very scrupulous in such matters, he has always thought it became him to borrow from no quarter without making a full and frank avowal of the fact. The author will be much rejoiced if this new edition shall be judged not less worthy than its predecessor to become a text book in Universities and Theological Celleges.|$|E

5|$|The team {{picked up}} their first single-day win {{the same day}} as the more prestigious Tour of Flanders, in which they participated but were not {{especially}} competitive, with Duque in 19th their best finisher. The race they won was the inaugural Flèche d'Emeraude, a new race in the UCI Europe Tour and the French Road Cycling Cup. Gallopin came first {{at the head of a}} field sprint in Saint-Malo. Zingle figured into a winning breakaway at the Brabantse Pijl, the precursor to the Ardennes classics. He took seventh place, <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> a half back of the winner Philippe Gilbert. Vogondy was sixth at the Tour du Finistère, finishing with a big main group behind two leaders.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the stage}} 16 {{individual}} time trial being almost fully {{composed of the}} Nevegal climb, Antón finished the stage in 13th, <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 21 seconds back of the day's winner Contador while Nieve was 36th, two minutes 19 seconds down. Nieve fell to sixth overall, while Antón moved past David Arroyo for tenth as Arroyo lost even more time than Antón did. While Antón again fell from the top ten {{as a result of}} Kanstantsin Sivtsov's stage 17 breakaway ride gaining him just under three minutes, Nieve's position held steady until stage 20, the Giro's final road race. 's Vasil Kiryienka rode to a dominant stage victory, coming in almost five minutes before the day's second-placed rider and about six minutes ahead of the largest group of the race's top riders. Nieve was a further three minutes down in 17th, and fell to tenth overall. Nieve stood to lose time in the more straightforward stage 21 individual time trial, where he, like most of the team, struggles mightily. He indeed finished well down, in 114th place on the day nearly four minutes slower than the day's winner David Millar. With Sivtsov tenth two and a half minutes better than Nieve, he took the Basque's top-ten overall position, leaving Nieve to finish the Giro 11th overall. Antón, for his part, finished in 18th place, having lost nearly twenty minutes in stage 19.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the third}} period Eric Staal tied the game at seven with his first goal of the game. Minutes later Duchene got a breakaway, but before he could take a shot, Ovechkin threw his stick at the puck, {{resulting}} in the first penalty shot in All-Star game history, and only the third penalty assessed during the past ten years of All-Star competition. Duchene took the shot against Henrik Lundqvist, who stopped the attempt. Kris Letang scored shortly after the penalty shot to give back the lead to Team Staal. Briere scored a little over a minute later assisted by Weber and Henrik Sedin to re-tie the game. Weber's assist was his fourth of the game making him the second defenceman in history to record four assists in an All-Star Game (Ray Bourque, 1985). Team Lidstrom added two more goals before Rick Nash scored to cut the deficit to one. With about <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> a half left in the game, Team Staal pulled their goaltender for the extra attacker. The decision backfired as Eriksson scored on the empty net with 1:11 remaining. Eric Staal scored with 33.6 seconds remaining to bring his team back within one goal, but they failed to get another shot on goal before time ran out. By coming back from a four-goal deficit to win the game Team Lidstrom set the record for biggest comeback victory in All-Star history. Lidstrom finished the game with a +7 rating, the highest rating since 1991 when Adam Oates was also a +7 for the Wales Conference. Tim Thomas earned the victory becoming the first goaltender to win three straight All-Star Games. Patrick Sharp was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) after registering one goal and two assists in a losing cause for Team Staal. The combined 21 goals was the fourth highest total in NHL All-Star Game history.|$|E
