5|$|Every June, the {{mountain}} {{is the site}} of the Mount Washington Road Race, an event which attracts hundreds of runners. In August the Mount Washington Auto Road Bicycle Hillclimb, a bicycle race, takes place along the same route <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> race. The hillclimb's notable contestants include former Tour de France contender Tyler Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|Plans to {{construct}} a road from Brawley to Glamis date from 1953; the road would provide improved access to two newer state parks. The ceding of the Chocolate Mountains to the U.S. Navy had closed a north–south road traversing Imperial County, and the government needed to restore a corridor for local residents to use, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> was closed during the day for five days a week. However, in August, the Riverside Chamber of Commerce opposed the construction, even though it would replace the Niland–Blythe road. The chamber reversed its stance in December, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> would mostly be constructed in Imperial County.|$|E
5|$|Rane, {{in command}} of {{a section of the}} 37th Assault Field Company, {{attached}} to the 4th Dogra Battalion, was sent forward to help clear a path for the battalion. As Rane and his team started clearing a minefield, mortar fire from the Pakistanis killed two sappers and wounded five others, including Rane. Despite this, by the evening of 8 April, Rane and his surviving men cleared the minefield which enabled the supporting tanks to move forward. A safe lane still had to be prepared for the tanks <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> ahead was still dangerous; the Pakistani forces had yet to be cleared from the area. This lane was created by Rane through the night. The next day, his section worked for twelve continuous hours to clear mines and roadblocks. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> was still too difficult to deal with, he made a diversion for the battalion to forward. Rane continued this work despite ongoing artillery and mortar fire from the Pakistanis.|$|E

A footbridge was subsequently constructed, crossing Princess Road {{at the same place}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> previously ran. As part of the regeneration of the Hulme district, it was decided to construct a new bridge to rejoin the two sections of the road, and also to provide a local landmark.|$|E
5|$|The road, {{as well as}} {{all other}} state roads in Croatia, is managed and {{maintained}} by Hrvatske ceste, a state-owned company. The road carries an annual average daily traffic of about 2,000 vehicles, and the traffic volume increases by up to 1,000 vehicles in summer <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is used by tourists in the region. The southernmost portion of the road is significantly more congested as it carries Pula suburban traffic.|$|E
5|$|A mile east of Highway 133, {{the valley}} floor widens, filled with farms and subdivisions <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> gently trends to the south. Five miles (8km) east of Carbondale, Highway 82 crosses into Eagle County. Subdivisions begin to {{increase}} in the surrounding valley and the road soon turns to the south again as it passes a built-up area and then crosses the Roaring Fork. A {{mile and a half}} after that Highway 82 crosses the Roaring Fork and then enters Pitkin County at the small unincorporated community of Emma.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the town}} line, NY11A intersects Otisco Road (CR246) and passes several farms {{on its way}} to the hamlet of Cardiff. Here, the route runs past a line of homes prior to passing under US20 at the {{northern}} edge of the community. Outside of Cardiff, the highway becomes known as Syracuse–Tully Valley Road as it slowly curves to the northwest, matching a similar turn in the course of the creek and its valley. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> traverses another stretch of cultivated fields, it meets Field Lane, a short connector providing access between NY11A and US20. Past this point, NY11A serves little more than farms before it enters the Onondaga Reservation. At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the Onondaga Nation.|$|E
5|$|After NY18, NY93 curves to the southeast, serving another {{residential}} stretch {{ahead of}} a junction with YoungstownWilson Road (CR36) on {{the eastern edge of}} Towers Corners. After this intersection, the homes give way to farms <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> heads into rural areas of the town. The route continues on a southeast track through Porter, passing a mixture of rural and residential areas on its way into the hamlet of Porter Center, where NY93 enters an intersection with Porter Center Road (CR57). Another southeastward stretch brings the route across Twelvemile Creek and into the hamlet of Ransomville, where NY93 becomes the community's main street. Through Ransomville, NY93 retains the YoungstownLockport Road name, intersecting with Ransomville Road (CR17) in the hamlet's business district.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> {{condition}} required {{extremely good}} driving skills, the China Relief Fund decided to test drivers {{and established a}} driving institute on a vacant piece of accessible land behind the Siong Lim Temple. Venerable Pu Liang, the monastery's 10th abbot, supported the China Relief Fund. Qualified volunteers from Nanyang converged in Singapore to form a batch. In 1939, about 3,200volunteers left in nine batches that included not only Chinese men, but also Indians, Malays, and four Chinese women. About 1,000 of them died in service, 1,000 settled in China and others returned to Nanyang after the war. The Venerable {{and two of his}} disciples were later arrested and executed during the Sook Ching Massacre in 1942.|$|E

5|$|Being a free city, Sélestat {{attracted}} settlers {{from the}} region who sought protection, freedom and a thriving economic environment. The first city wall, which had become too constricting, was replaced in 1280, and a third wall had to be erected in the 16th century as the city grew. At {{the end of the}} Middle Ages, the population was estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000. It was then the fourth largest Alsatian town after Strasbourg (18,000), Colmar and Haguenau (6,000 each). The local economy reached its zenith around 1500. It was centered on shipping and trade (mainly hay, cereals, wine, fish, glass, iron and salt). <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> network was poor and dangerous, goods transited via the Ill river.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{requested}} that Jean Dupont, {{the editor of}} L'Écho illustré– the magazine in which The Adventures of Tintin was serialised in Switzerland– send him documentation on Swiss railways which he could draw from. He also {{requested that}} his Swiss friend Charly Fornora send him a bottle of Valais wine which he could again use as a model from which to draw. Hergé subsequently travelled to Switzerland himself to produce accurate sketches of scenes around Geneva which he could then incorporate into the story; these included at Geneva Cointrin International Airport, Genève-Cornavin railway station, and the Cornavin Hotel, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> through Cervens and Topolino's house in Nyon. Despite this realism, a number of minor errors were made in Hergé's depiction of Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Just east of Bradhurst Avenue, NY141 {{connects to}} the Taconic State Parkway {{by way of a}} partial interchange. The {{junction}} has only two connections; the first links NY141 to the southbound parkway, while the second leads from the northbound direction of the parkway to NY141 via West Cross Street. Continuing eastward, the highway passes under the parkway and enters the commercial center of Hawthorne. Here, NY141 crosses over the Metro-North Railroad before turning northward onto Elwood Avenue. Over the next , NY141 closely parallels the railroad's Harlem Line, serving its Hawthorne station <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> heads north. After three blocks, the road and railroad turn to the northeast and begin to run alongside the Saw Mill River Parkway. Elwood Avenue ends shortly after the curve, giving way to Commerce Street.|$|E

5|$|M-13 {{angles to}} the {{northwest}} briefly before returning to a due north course along East Road. The highway crosses the Flint River in another area of farm fields. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> approaches Saginaw, it crosses the Cass River and runs {{to the east of}} it as it merges with the Shiawassee River and the Tittabawassee River to form the Saginaw River. M-13 follows Washington Avenue in the city of Saginaw inland from, but parallel to, the Saginaw River through downtown. The trunkline intersects M-46, which follows Rust Avenue, and passes Hoyt Park. Washington Avenue runs by the campus of St. Mary's of Michigan Medical Center. As the highway passes out of downtown, it crosses or runs alongside lines of the Saginaw Bay Southern and Lake State railways.|$|E
5|$|M-50 {{continues}} its journey through Jackson County, winding {{its way to}} the southeast through rural fields and small forests. The landscape transitions to residential neighborhoods <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> approaches the US127 freeway north of Jackson. In Blackman Township, M-50 merges with US127 to run concurrently into the north side of Jackson. After an interchange with I-94 at exit138, US127 exits to run east on I-94 for , M-50 and Business US127 (Bus. US127) run concurrently into the city as West Avenue passing by the Jackson Crossing shopping mall. The road then proceeds south through the northern side of the city before turning east on Michigan Avenue as it heads towards downtown.|$|E
5|$|NY111 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY27A (Main Street) {{in the town}} of Islip. The route proceeds north through the hamlet of Islip along the two-lane Islip Avenue, passing through a short residential stretch ahead of an intersection with CR50 (Union Boulevard). NY111 soon crosses the nearby Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road just east of the Islip station, from where it continues north past various businesses and residences. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> heads northward, it intersects with Bittermint Street, a connector to NY27 (Sunrise Highway) eastbound. After crossing over NY27, the route intersects with a ramp serving the westbound lanes and Islip Boulevard, which connects NY27 westbound to NY111.|$|E

5|$|Past Phoenicia, the {{surrounding}} slopes become steeper <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and creek curve around Panther Mountain, {{one of the}} Catskill High Peaks, to the south. At Allaben, the Shandaken Tunnel crosses under the road, bringing water from Schoharie Reservoir into the creek. The road and creek start bending to the south to the hamlet of Shandaken, where the town hall {{on the south side}} of the road is followed by the southern terminus of NY42's northern segment. As NY28 continues trending southwest, the valley becomes less developed. Balsam Mountain, another High Peak, looms ahead.|$|E
5|$|Past the Atlantic City Expressway, the two-lane {{undivided}} road {{comes to an}} intersection with CR 559. From this point, Route 54 is lined with residences and businesses as it comes into downtown Hammonton. The road crosses New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line immediately before a junction with CR 561. After CR 561, the route becomes Bellevue Avenue and encounters the western terminus of CR 542. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> leaves the downtown area, the surroundings become more residential. Route 54 ends at an intersection with US 30 and US 206, where the road continues north as US 206.|$|E
5|$|Route 413 {{begins at}} the state line, midway along the BurlingtonBristol Bridge, as a {{continuation}} of PA413. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> descends from the bridge, a toll booth spans {{the width of the}} road though a toll is only collected for westbound traffic.
