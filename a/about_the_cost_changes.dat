The IEEE Single Phase Harmonics Task Force (P 1495) is developing a similar standard for single phase loads of less than 40 A. There is, however, still no agreement on what such limits should be, or whether limits are even needed. Electric utilities are concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> effects of harmonics on their systems: telephone noise, excessive heating of transformers and other equipment, capacitor damage, and others, {{and would like to}} limit the levels of harmonics produced by loads on their systems. Manufacturers, however, are concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of <b>changes</b> to their equipment to reduce harmonic production. This paper summarizes the IEC limits and the proposed IEEE limits, discusses the need for single phase harmonic limits, and presents what those limits might be...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} the fourth {{of a series of}} reports {{detailing}} the outcomes of a research project based in the Desert Uplands region of central-western Queensland. The aim of the project is to demonstrate to government that public and/or private funds can be efficiently allocated for vegetation corridor protection through voluntary engagement with landholders. The mechanism to demonstrate is a type of auction (competitive tendering) system where competing proposals for corridor locations are evaluated for potential funding. The focus of the research project is to evaluate different auction mechanisms that encourage cooperative outcomes in a competitive tendering environment. A series of experimental workshops were held with landholders in the Desert Uplands region, to test the design of a suitable auction format. The results from these workshops are presented in this report. The workshops were divided into two sessions. The first focused on multiple individual bidding rounds. The main aim in these rounds was to familiarize landholders with the process, identify the monetary tradeoffs associated with setting aside conservation blocks, examine the strategies used between bidding rounds and to determine if competitive pressure would drive down the relative bid values. In the second session of the workshops two different bidding formats were tested to develop a suitable auction design when collaboration between participants is required to achieve a particular outcome – in this case, the formation of a vegetation corridor. First, a format of group bids was tested and second, a two stage (bid/rebid) individual bidding system was tried. An experimental workshop design (with landholders as participants), was favoured over the more common use of laboratory experiments (usually with students as participants) as the method of testing auction design. It was important to gather information (that only local landholders would have), <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of management <b>changes,</b> and about their attitudes to, and behaviour in, a competitive tender process. Some useful insights into the relative advantages of an experimental workshop over a laboratory experiment are presented in the report, {{as well as some of}} the tradeoffs...|$|R
40|$|Demand surge is {{understood}} to be a socio-economic phenomenon of large-scale natural disasters, most commonly explained by higher repair costs (after a large- versus small-scale disaster) resulting from higher material prices and labor wages. This study tests this explanation by developing quantitative models for <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>change</b> of sets, or “baskets, ” of repairs to damage caused by Atlantic hurricanes making landfall on the mainland United States. We define six such baskets, representing <b>the</b> total repair <b>cost,</b> and material and labor components, each for a typical residential or commercial property. We collect <b>cost</b> data from <b>the</b> leading provider of these data to insurance claims adjusters in the United States, and we calculate <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>changes</b> from July to January for nine Atlantic hurricane seasons at fifty-two cities on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. The data show that: <b>changes</b> in labor <b>costs</b> drive <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> in total repair costs; <b>cost</b> <b>changes</b> can vary significantly by geographic region and year; and <b>cost</b> <b>changes</b> for <b>the</b> residential basket of repairs are more volatile than <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>changes</b> for <b>the</b> commercial basket. We then propose a series of multilevel regression models to predict <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>changes</b> by considering several combinations of the following explanatory variables: the largest gradient wind speed at a city in a hurricane season; the number of tropical storms in a hurricane season whose center passes within 200 km of a city; and <b>cost</b> <b>changes</b> in <b>the</b> first two quarters of the year. We also allow the coefficients of the regression model to b...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{view of the}} {{previous}} studies on uncontrollable construction cost, which mostly {{were based on the}} practical experiences and subjective speculating, the conclusions were empirical and lack of data support. In order to solve this problem, the quantitative analysis methods are introduced here. The application of ABC analysis method can distinguish the minor-key factors from tremendous factors which influence <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>changes.</b> And <b>the</b> complete decomposition of construction <b>cost</b> <b>changes</b> can decompose <b>the</b> main effects of <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>changes</b> to define <b>the</b> key effects. Through applying these two methods, <b>the</b> construction <b>cost</b> can be controlled by mainly controlling the key factors and effects of the projects. Besides, project data of uncontrollable construction cost can be accumulated to provide objective and scientific suggestions on controlling cost.

40|$|Incremental {{heuristic}} searches try {{to reuse}} their previous search efforts whenever these are available. As a result, they can often solve {{a sequence of}} similar planning problems much faster than planning from scratch. State-of-the-art incremental heuristic searches such as LPA*, D * and D * Lite all work by propagating <b>cost</b> <b>changes</b> to all <b>the</b> states on the search tree whose g-values (<b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of computed paths from the start) are no longer optimal. While such a complete propagation of <b>cost</b> <b>changes</b> is required to ensure optimality, the propagations can be stopped much earlier if {{we are looking for}} solutions within a given suboptimality bound. We present a framework called Truncated Incremental Search that builds on this observation, and uses a target suboptimality bound to efficiently restrict <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> propagations. Using this framework, we develop two algorithms, Truncated LPA * (TLPA*) and Truncated D * Lite (TD * Lite). We discuss their analytical properties and present experimental results for 2 D and 3 D (x, y, heading) path planning that show significant improvement in runtime over existing incremental heuristic searches when searching for close-to-optimal solutions. In addition, unlike typical incremental searches, Truncated Incremental Search is much less dependent on the proximity of <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>changes</b> to <b>the</b> goal of the search due to the early termination of <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>change</b> propagation...|$|R
