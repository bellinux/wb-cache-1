5|$|A {{survey of}} New York {{businesses}} found {{an increase of}} 8.5 percent in health care costs, less than the prior year's survey had expected. A 10 percent increase was expected for 2017. Factors included increased premiums, higher drug costs, ACA <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> workers. Some firms lowered costs by increasing cost-sharing (for higher employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments). 60% planned to further increase cost-sharing. Coverage and benefits were not expected to change. Approximately one fifth said ACA had pushed them to reduce their workforce. A larger number said they were raising prices.|$|E
5|$|Between 1994 and 2009, {{the city}} had a declining <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> {{population}} compared to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as young people moved {{to the center of}} the country for education and jobs, while young families migrated to bedroom communities in the suburbs. However, as a result of new projects and improving infrastructure, the city managed to reverse its population decline, reducing emigration while attracting more internal migration into the city. In 2009, positive net immigration into the city was shown for the first time in 15 years.|$|E

5|$|In October 2008, new {{insights}} into the effect of Internet usage on cognition were gleaned from the results, reported in a press release, of a study conducted by UCLA's Memory <b>and</b> <b>Aging</b> Research Center that had tested two groups of people between the ages of 55 and 76 years old; only one group of which were experienced web users. While they had read books or performed assigned search tasks their brain activity had been monitored with functional MRI scans, which revealed that both reading and web search utilize the same language, reading, memory, and visual regions of the brain; however, it was discovered that those searching the web stimulated additional decision-making and complex reasoning regions of the brain, with a two-fold increase in these regions in experienced web users compared with inexperienced web users. Gary Small, the director of the UCLA center and lead investigator of the UCLA study, concurrently released the book iBrain: Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind, co-authored with Gigi Vorgan, with the press release.|$|E
5|$|Streep {{established}} {{herself as}} a leading Hollywood actress in the 1980s. She played dual roles in the period drama The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981), and starred as a Polish holocaust survivor in Sophie's Choice (1982). She was awarded the Best Actress Oscar for the latter. Streep portrayed the real-life character of Karen Silkwood in Mike Nichols' drama Silkwood (1983), before starring in her most financially successful release of the decade, the romantic drama Out of Africa (1985), in which she played the Danish writer Karen Blixen. Despite intermittent successes, Streep's career went {{through a period of}} decline post-1985, with several commentators criticizing her for her inclination towards melodramatic roles. The criticism continued despite her attempts to actively star in commercial comedies; her roles that parodied women's beauty <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> in the films She-Devil (1989) and Death Becomes Her (1992) were panned.|$|E
30|$|Panel A of Table  8 {{shows the}} {{coefficients}} on ASY for different saturated versions of model (1), {{where we have}} included polynomials on SIZE <b>and</b> <b>Age.</b> Since these coefficients are quite stable from the simplest models to the more saturated models on size <b>and</b> <b>age,</b> {{these findings suggest that}} ASY contains information beyond SIZE <b>and</b> <b>Age</b> that is relevant for capital structure. In addition, we have performed two other tests. First, we have orthogonalised SIZE and ASY, by regressing ASY on SIZE, and taking the residuals as the part of ASY which is not explained by SIZE (r_ASY). Second, we have regressed ASY on SIZE <b>and</b> <b>Age,</b> <b>and</b> we have taken the residuals as the part of ASY which is not explained by SIZE <b>and</b> <b>Age</b> (z_ASY). Then, we include r_ASY or z_ASY in the original model with size or size <b>and</b> <b>age</b> controls, respectively, instead of our original ASY variable. The results, as shown in the Panel B of Table  8, are also significant and the coefficients on r_ASY or z_ASY are very stable. Overall, all these findings suggest that the effect of ASY on firm’s debt financing decisions is not caused by firm size <b>and</b> <b>age.</b>|$|R

Third, we build clas-sifiers that aim to predict deception, gen-der, <b>and</b> <b>age.</b> Our findings show that while deception detection can be performed in short texts {{even in the absence}} of a pre-determined domain, gender <b>and</b> <b>age</b> pre-diction in deceptive texts is a challenging task.
