25|$|Charlie's {{family was}} not {{dysfunctional}} or abusive. On the contrary, Charlie's parents adored him, and made great sacrifices {{to give him}} a good education. His Da, a gardener for a rich Anglo-Irish family, was kind and patient, but also woefully unsophisticated and lacking in ambition. Charlie loved Da, but was also embarrassed by him, and felt guilty for this embarrassment. Charlie was an illegitimate child at a time when this carried a heavy stigma in Catholic Ireland. Though Da accepted Charlie fully, Charlie <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> an outsider, heavily indebted to Da. Moreover, Charlie could never find a way to repay Da, or even fully express his love and gratitude.|$|E

I <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I'd started on it, always had been on it and could go anywhere, even down in to the deep Delta country. It was the same road, full of the same contradictions, the same one-horse towns, the same spiritual ancestors... It was my place in the universe, <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it was in my blood." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{effects were}} conflictingly appraised. Schickel {{wrote that the}} effects were [...] "technically adroit" [...] and {{occasionally}} [...] "witty", and Ebert singled out the Bird of Prey as a [...] "great-looking" [...] ship. Sterritt felt that the settings <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> they were on soundstages rather than out in space, and Denby wrote that more {{could have been done}} with Genesis, and that while it was an interesting concept its special effects execution was lacking. Kempley appreciated the sets' low values, writing that [...] "the fakier the sets", the closer the film felt to its television origins.|$|E

Morris expressed that [...] "I think the time is right. After the first film, I wanted to hear more from Jay, Will, Neil and Simon. But this time I feel there is enough. There {{is more than enough}} Jay in this world", and Beesley added [...] "The end of the story has <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the time where they go off and start living their adult life. And I think this film takes us up to that point".|$|E
500|$|In April 1953, her {{daughter}} Deirdre Angela Shaw was born. Shaw {{had a son}} by a previous marriage, David, and after gaining legal custody of the boy in 1953 he brought him to California {{to live with the}} family; with three children to raise, the Shaws moved to a larger house on San Vincente Boulevard in Santa Monica. However, Lansbury did not feel entirely comfortable in the Hollywood social scene, later asserting {{that as a result of}} her British roots, [...] "in Hollywood, I <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a stranger in a strange land." [...] In 1959 the family moved to Malibu, settling into a house on the Pacific Coast Highway that had been designed by Aaron Green; there, she and Peter escaped the Hollywood scene, and were able to send their children to a local public school.|$|E
500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — and this is what I tell people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream." ...|$|E

The remains seemed to leer at her with a kind of furtive swagger, after the manner of broken bottles. A quick thrill of anger ran through Elizabeth. She had <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> more <b>like</b> a mother to Nutty than a sister, and now she would have liked to {{exercise}} the maternal privilege of slapping him.|$|R
60|$|He had {{not gone}} to church since he left the workhouse: {{he did not think}} it belonged to vagabonds like him; besides, he <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> walls <b>like</b> a prison; and he had not profited much by the workhouse prayers, which were read on week-days by the master, and on Sundays by a chaplain, who always had more to do than he could manage, and only went to the paupers when they were very ill. But when Mr. Cope talked to him of the duty of going to church, he said, 'I will, Sir;' and he sat in the gallery with the young lads, who were not quite as {{delicate}} as Alfred.|$|R
500|$|On 25 July 2014, Chelsea {{announced}} on their official website that Drogba completed {{his return to}} the club on a free transfer, and signed a one-year contract. Speaking on his move back to the club, Drogba said: [...] "It was an easy decision. I couldn't turn down the opportunity to work with José Mourinho again. Everyone knows the special relationship I have with this club and it has <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> home to me." [...] Mourinho also commented on the transfer, saying: [...] "He's coming because he's one of the best strikers in Europe. I know his personality very well and I know if he comes back he's not protected by history or what he's done for this club previously. He is coming with the mentality to make more history." [...] On 28 July 2014, Chelsea announced that Drogba would wear the number 15 shirt which he wore when he first signed for the club in 2004. Mohamed Salah, who wore the number during the 2013–14 season, took over the number 17 shirt vacated by Eden Hazard. On 15 August, however, it was announced that Drogba had been given back the number 11 shirt he previously wore at the club, with its previous occupant Oscar taking over the number 8 jersey vacated by Frank Lampard.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Rita {{has been well}} received by critics, who praised Benz’s portrayal. Eric Goldman of IGN has said, “Dexter does a solid job of developing {{the roles of the}} supporting cast, with Rita, Deb, Doakes and LaGuerta all getting a good amount of development”. [...] He added, “There were a couple of forced moments in [...] "Popping Cherry", most notably the drug dealer who came to Rita's house, in broad daylight, demanding money for her ex-husband's debts; it was all a bit over the top and cliché. On the other hand, it was interesting to note Dexter's inaction in that scene, making one wonder if perhaps he fears that any public display of physical defense, even for Rita, might result in him going too far and revealing what he is." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post has said, [...] "Rita <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the light in that dark show", and [...] "In the beginning Rita was the vessel through which the audience could love Dexter." [...] UGO.com placed Rita Bennett 7th on a list of [...] "Top 11 Girlfriends on TV". Zap2it created a poll entitled [...] "Best Mom" [...] as part of their [...] "Greatest TV Characters" [...] series of polls; Rita was voted 12th on a list of 14 characters.|$|E
500|$|Will Smith {{signed on}} to play Robert Neville in April 2006. He said he took on I Am Legend because he felt it could be like [...] "Gladiator [...] Forrest Gump—these are movies with wonderful, audience-pleasing elements, but also uncompromised artistic value. [...] <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it had those {{possibilities}} to me." [...] The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001). He said that [...] "when you're on your own, {{it is kind of}} hard to find conflict." [...] The film's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes. To prepare for his role, Smith visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia. He also met with a person who had been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war. Smith compared Neville to Job, who lost his children, livelihood, and health. Like the Book of Job, I Am Legend studies the questions, [...] "Can he find a reason to continue? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?" [...] He also cited an influence in Tom Hanks' performance in Cast Away (2000).|$|E

We had a ball back then," [...] adding, [...] "we just really pretty much made records like we <b>always</b> did and <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we should use the old formulas with no more sort of experiments and just pretty much do what Accept is known for; and that's what we did." ...|$|R
500|$|Jay Z {{assisted}} him in {{the production}} of what would become his debut album Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor. The title of the album is a reference to 'Food and Liquor' stores common in Chicago. He explains, [...] "The store is where everything is at...Food to me represents growth and progression. You eat food and you get strength. You need it to live. Liquor is not a necessity; it is a want. It destroys you. It breaks you down. I can see why it's prohibited in Islam...I've <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> liquor represents the bad, the food represents the good, and everyone is made up of a little of both." [...] Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor was officially released on September 19, 2006. The album featured production from Jay-Z, Kanye West, Mike Shinoda, The Neptunes, Prolyfic, among others. The record spawned the singles [...] "Kick, Push", [...] "I Gotcha" [...] and [...] "Daydreamin'" [...] featuring Jill Scott. The critically lauded album was later nominated for three Grammy Awards including Best Rap Album. Fiasco won [...] "Best Urban/Alternative Performance" [...] for [...] "Daydreamin'".

500|$|Beyoncé {{explained}} on her iTunes Radio {{channel that}} [...] "Rocket" [...] {{was one of}} the [...] "most sensual songs", adding that it reminded her of the vibes of D'Angelo's song [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] (2000). The singer elaborated the concept behind the song during an album documentary filmed for Beyoncé, titled [...] "Honesty", saying, [...] "Now I'm in my 30s, and those children that grew up listening to me have grown up, and I <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it was my responsibility to be aware of kids and their parents and all these generation". With that said, the singer felt [...] "stifled" [...] and unable to express every feeling she wanted to show. However, she noted that with [...] "Rocket", one of the most liberating songs on the record, she managed to express many of those feelings and show different sides of her personality. Revealing that she would not have been confident enough to record the song earlier in her career, Beyoncé noted, [...] "I kinda dropped that fourth wall and I did it". The singer also discussed the meaning of the song by saying, [...] "What I love about this song is, it takes you through this journey. You're flirting and you're talking all of your arrogant [...] Then you climax, and then you have your cigarette... This song actually is about singing from the heart, and harmonies and adlibs and arrangement". During the same video, she praised Timberlake and Miguel's work; the clip also showed footage of Beyoncé recording the song in the studio.|$|E

50|$|There {{are a lot}} of similarities, I think, and it’s so true in Emily's {{family life}} as well. Even the fact that he’s the father of the philosopher and has all these crazy ideas and attracts this cultish {{following}} is very similar to Xenophilius father. What attracts me to all characters is just authenticity and that boldness of self-expression, which I think they both do. Luna does it effortlessly in that she’s who she is and she has no problem with that and she doesn’t ever try to inhibit or change herself. And I think Emily is the same way, slightly more defiantly. I think Emily is a lot angrier at the world and sees so much fakery and pretension among her teenage peers, and I think she rebels against that by being so authentic and so true to herself. I just admire women like that because I, certainly growing up, felt unusual, felt odd, and felt I didn’t really have a place where I fit. But I <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> uncomfortable <b>like</b> that, and those women, like Emily and like Luna, they give me the confidence to just fit in that uncomfortable space.|$|R

2500|$|The {{film was}} a success and was the only silent {{independent}} film of Swanson's to do well at the box office. It {{was one of her}} last financially successful films, including the talkies The Trespasser and Sunset Blvd. It went on to make $1,000,000 during its US run. However, at Kennedy's advice, Swanson had sold her distribution rights for the film to Schenck, as Kennedy felt it would be a commercial failure. He also didn't care for the image Swanson portrayed in the film. By this point, Queen Kelly had been a disaster, and Swanson regretted it. [...] The film made the top ten best pictures of the year list as well. It was Raoul Walsh's final role, as he subsequently lost an eye in an accident. The film was nominated for awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Gloria Swanson) and Best Cinematography. Swanson did not attend the ceremony, and <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> it was <b>like</b> [...] "comparing apples to oranges".
