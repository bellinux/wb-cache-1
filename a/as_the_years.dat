5|$|Another {{key figure}} in Skagen, P.S. Krøyer, married Marie Triepcke after {{falling in love with}} her in Paris in 1888. The {{daughter}} of a prosperous German loomery engineer, she was said to be {{the most beautiful woman in}} Copenhagen. However, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> went by, Krøyer's health began to deteriorate and Marie was increasingly unhappy with their marriage. The marriage finally ended in a divorce in 1905 when Marie became pregnant after an affair with the composer Hugo Alfvén whom she then married. Krøyer died in Skagen four years later, apparently as a result of mental illness.|$|E
50|$|Note: There {{is often}} {{confusion}} in reporting <b>the</b> awards <b>as</b> <b>the</b> award is sometimes announced around December and sometimes around January. Consequently, some sources give <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>the</b> competition closed, and some <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>the</b> award was announced. This {{may account for}} any apparent discrepancies in the list given below. There is no official listing from The Age to clarify the situation.|$|R

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> pass, {{the rural}} area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and {{in an odd way}} he looks forward to it as the only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> went by {{with further}} childlessness, Ernest became more distant to his wife, and was {{continually}} unfaithful. Though Alexandrine {{continued to be}} devoted, choosing to ignore those relationships she was aware of, her loyalty became increasingly baffling to those outside her immediate family. By 1859, after seventeen years of childlessness, Ernest took no further interest in his wife.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> went on, {{the disease}} slowly {{destroyed}} Reagan's mental capacity. He was {{only able to}} recognize a few people, including his wife, Nancy. He remained active, however; he took walks through parks near his home and on beaches, played golf regularly, and until 1999 he often went to his office in nearby Century City.|$|E

5|$|During {{the initial}} months on board, Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black) {{repeatedly}} tries to seduce Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks). Daniel finally confronts Vala {{for what he}} believes to be her insincerity, teasing, and mocking of him. Vala's upset reaction makes Daniel realize the honesty of her feelings, and they share a passionate embrace. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> pass, each team member attempts {{to deal with the}} isolation. General Landry develops a gardening hobby; Carter learns how to play the cello; Daniel continues the translation of Asgard information in the database and develops his relationship with Vala; and Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder) and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) exercise and train while Mitchell is growing more frustrated and angry. After many years, General Landry succumbs to old age and dies.|$|E
5|$|Ellen {{became a}} tourist {{attraction}} for the village, and her family made considerable money from visitors' donations. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> progressed {{with no sign of}} Ellen's waking, speculation grew that her illness was either a hoax or caused by her mother, an issue that was never resolved. In late 1880, soon after her mother's death, Ellen awoke. She later married and had at least five children.|$|E
5|$|In later life, she {{eventually}} adopted more conventional behaviour, took up pious works and even reformed the convent that became her second {{residence in the}} Paris suburbs. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> went by she suffered serious setbacks to her health and the sadness of mourning her eldest son, Grand Prince Ferdinando, for whom {{she had had a}} genuine affection. Rendered financially independent by a legacy, she purchased a house in Paris, from which she spent {{the end of her life}} dispensing charity and keeping up dignified correspondence.|$|E

5|$|In {{subsequent}} years Perfini released {{a number of}} commercially oriented films, such as Delapan Pendjuru Angin (Eight Compass Directions, 1957) and Asrama Dara (Dormitory for Girls, 1958). Though none of these were commercial failures, none except for Asrama Dara approached the financial success of Tiga Dara. Ismail attempted to reassert himself as a director of quality not-for-profit films through Pedjuang (Warriors for Freedom, 1960), which was screened in competition at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival in 1961. However, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> passed he became increasingly distanced from his early goals and had made attempts to enter banking, the nightclub industry, and parliament {{by the time of}} his death in 1971.|$|E
5|$|In the credits, the re-imagined {{series is}} said {{to be based on the}} 1976 novel by Terry Nation; however, there are a number of {{differences}} between the series and its source material. In the novel, Jenny Richards survives, whereas her counterpart in the 2008 series, Jenny Collins, does not; this means that Greg Preston and Jenny cannot have a child <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> unfold. Abby Grant still falls in love with Jimmy Garland; however, in the book, he eventually dies from septicaemia.|$|E
5|$|Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his group, Fatah, {{over more}} militant and Marxist Palestinian groups. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} more violent action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E

5|$|Rosas {{acquired}} a {{working knowledge of}} administering ranchlands and, beginning in 1811, took charge of his family's estancias. In 1813, he married Encarnación Ezcurra, daughter of a wealthy family from Buenos Aires. He soon afterwards sought to establish a career for himself, leaving his parent's estate. He produced salted meat and acquired landholdings in the process. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> passed he became an estanciero (rancher) in his own right, accumulating land while establishing a successful partnership with second cousins from the politically powerful Anchorena clan. His hard work and organisational skills in deploying labour were key to his success, rather than creating new or applying nontraditional approaches to production.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{architect}} Władysław Horodecki originally {{constructed the}} House with Chimaeras {{for use as}} his own upmarket apartment building {{during the period of}} 1901–1902. However, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> went by, Horodecki eventually had to sell the building due to financial troubles, after which it changed ownership numerous times before finally being occupied by an official Communist Party polyclinic until the early 2000s. When the building was vacated, its interior and exterior decor were fully reconstructed and restored according to Horodecki original plans.|$|E
5|$|The first {{permanent}} Portuguese {{settlement in}} the land which would become Brazil was São Vicente, which was established in 1532 by Martim Afonso de Sousa. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> passed, the Portuguese would slowly expand their frontiers westward, conquering more lands from both indigenous Americans and the Spanish. Brazil had secured most of its present-day borders by 1750 and was regarded by Portugal {{as the most important}} part of its far-flung maritime Empire. On 7 September 1822, the heir of Portuguese King Dom João VI secured the independence of Brazil from Portugal and, as Dom Pedro I, became its first Emperor.|$|E

5|$|With {{progress}} in palaeontology, {{the reputation of}} the models declined. In 1895, the American fossil hunter Othniel Charles Marsh scorned the dinosaurs' friends as doing them a great injustice, and spoke angrily of the models. The models and the park fell into disrepair <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> went by, a process aided by the fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace itself in 1936, and the models became obscured by overgrown foliage. A full restoration of the animals was carried out in 1952 by Victor H.C. Martin, at which time the mammals on the third island were moved to less well-protected locations in the park, where they were exposed to wear and tear. The limestone cliff was blown up in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, the {{railroad}} was already seeing signs of decreased ridership: there were 600 daily riders on the Yonkers branch, down from 2,000 daily riders sixteen years prior. The Interstate Commerce Commission gave New York Central Railroad permission {{to abandon the}} branch on November 12, 1942. Subsequently, riders filed a lawsuit to keep the line open, and the federal lawsuit was heard by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, who {{ruled in favor of}} {{the railroad}} on June 21, 1943. Nine days later, the railroad abandoned the line. By December 1944, the rails were being removed. The main line also saw fewer riders <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> passed, and on March B, 1958, with daily ridership numbering between 400 and 500 commuters, the New York State Public Service Commission gave its approval for the railroad to stop passenger service on the line. The last day of service was June 1, 1958, and the station was abandoned, the line now only being used for freight.|$|E
5|$|Committed {{to living}} the {{philosophy}} they sing about, {{the band members}} have each pursued careers apart from their lives as the superstars of Malagasy pop music. Most {{of the members of}} Mahaleo have also launched individual humanitarian projects, in addition to the cooperative they formed together in the 1980s to support the hand-made production of traditional musical instruments, and the Centre des informations de communication, d'animation, formation et d'éducation (CICAFE) rural development center they launched in 2000. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> passed {{and the members of the}} band matured in their respective careers, they started to write songs more relevant to the difficult conditions of life of the Malagasy people and the underdeveloped state of the nation, addressing such topics as environmental conservation, poverty, education, and violence. Among their hits in this period are songs that address rural-urban flight, homesickness after moving abroad to find work, husbands who abandon their families, and the guilt of military personnel required to carry out repression against their compatriots.|$|E
