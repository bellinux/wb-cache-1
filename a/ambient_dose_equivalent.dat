40|$|PURPOSE: EOS (EOS imaging S. A, Paris, France) is {{an x-ray}} imaging system that uses slot-scanning {{technology}} {{in order to}} optimize the trade-off between image quality and dose. The goal {{of this study was}} to characterize the EOS system in terms of occupational exposure, organ doses to patients as well as image quality for full spine examinations. METHODS: Occupational exposure was determined by measuring the <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalents</b> in the radiological room during a standard full spine examination. The patient dosimetry was performed using anthropomorphic phantoms representing an adolescent and a five-year-old child. The organ doses were measured with thermoluminescent detectors and then used to calculate effective doses. Patient exposure with EOS was then compared to dose levels reported for conventional radiological systems. Image quality was assessed in terms of spatial resolution and different noise contributions to evaluate the detector's performances of the system. The spatial-frequency signal transfer efficiency of the imaging system was quantified by the detective quantum efficiency (DQE). RESULTS: The use of a protective apron when the medical staff or parents have to stand near to the cubicle in the radiological room is recommended. The estimated effective dose to patients undergoing a full spine examination with the EOS system was 290 μSv for an adult and 200 μSv for a child. MTF and NPS are nonisotropic, with higher values in the scanning direction; they are in addition energy-dependent, but scanning speed independent. The system was shown to be quantum-limited, with a maximum DQE of 13 %. The relevance of the DQE for slot-scanning system has been addressed. CONCLUSIONS: As a summary, the estimated effective dose was 290 μSv for an adult; the image quality remains comparable to conventional systems...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to quantify the radiation exposure and verify the safety of the procedure and the facilities, especially during pathologic process. Materials and Methods: Sentinel lymph node biopsies with Tc- 99 m human serum albumin were performed as routine clinical work. Exposed radiation doses were measured in pathologic technologist, nuclear medicine technologist, and nuclear medicine physician using a thermoluminescence dosimeter (TLD) during one month. We also measured the residual radioactivities or absorbed dose rates, the exposure distance and time during procedure, the radiation dose of the waste and the <b>ambient</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> of the pathology laboratory. Results: Actual exposed doses were 0. 21 and 0. 85 (uSv/study) for the whole body and hand of pathology technologist after 47 sentinel node pathologic preparations were performed. Whole body exposed doses of nuclear medicine physician and technologist were 0. 2 and 2. 3 (uSv/study). According to this data and the exposure threshold of the general population (1 mSv), at least 1100 studies were allowed in pathology technologist. The calculated exposed dose rates (μSv/study) from residual radioactivities data were 2. 47 / 22. 4 μSv (whole body/ hand) for the surgeon; 0. 22 / 0 μSv for operation nurse.

The focus of this paper is on atmospheric GCR exposure during geomagnetically quiet conditions, with three main objectives. First, provide detailed descriptions of the NAIRAS GCR transport and dosimetry methodologies. Second, present a climatology of effective dose and <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> rates at typical commercial airline altitudes representative of solar cycle maximum and solar cycle minimum conditions and spanning the full range of geomagnetic cutoff rigidities. Third, conduct an initial validation of the NAIRAS model by comparing predictions of <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> rates with tabulated reference measurement data and recent aircraft radiation measurements taken in 2008 during the minimum between solar cycle 23 and solar cycle 24. By applying the criterion of the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) on acceptable levels of aircraft radiation dose uncertainty for <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> {{greater than or equal to}} an annual dose of 1 mSv, the NAIRAS model is within 25 % of the measured data, which fall within the ICRU acceptable uncertainty limit of 30 %. The NAIRAS model predictions of <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> rate are generally within 50 % of the measured data for any single-point comparison. The largest differences occur at low latitudes and high cutoffs, where the radiation dose level is low. Nevertheless, analysis suggests that these single-point differences will be within 30 % when a new deterministic pion-initiated electromagnetic cascade code is integrated into NAIRAS, an effort which is currently underway...|$|E
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{determination of}} personal <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> requires {{the proper use}} of appropriate radiological quantities and units, knowledge of the <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> response of the personal dosemeters used and detailed information on the fluence as well as <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> spectra at the workplaces. This information can then be used to select the appropriate dosemeters, to set up the optimum calibration conditions and to introduce, in case of need, normalisation factors for application in specific radiation fields. High-energy neutrons contribute significantly to the radiation fields around high-energy particle accelerators. Examples for procedures and methods to determine personal <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> at accelerator centres are give...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Two {{methods of}} {{radiological}} survey {{in a medical}} X ray room are compared. The first method is just the usual one, as done today in Brazil. It {{is based on the}} election of a high voltage (HV) value, by legal rule the highest used in the clinic, taken as a standard [1]. This highest HV value is supposed to be constant and representative of all others values, which are simply ignored. This work shows that the results of this approach move away a bit from the actual radiation doses, overestimating the values. A second method is proposed and compared with the first one. It takes the various values of HV into account. One should only assume a quadratic relationship between the dose measurements and HV and change the way of workload data acquirement. This second method presents a modified way to calculate the <b>ambient</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> [H*(10) ]. It is shown that the spread of values present by the 2 nd method is smaller than that of the current one, although in the 2 nd method the values are still overestimated, however not too much. Putting both methods side by side, as a conclusion, the second one shows to be better than the first, as it adheres more to the reality...|$|R
40|$|Personal neutron dosemeters {{from seven}} US Department of Energy (DOE) {{laboratories}} {{were mailed to}} the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) and irradiated using the well-characterised CERN reference radiation facility (CERF). Neutron <b>dose</b> <b>equivalents</b> determined using the DOE personal dosemeters have been compared to the reference <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> as determined using a tissue-equivalent proportional counter (TEPC). In the 0. 5 to 5 mSv <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> range, the comparison of results suggests that the neutron personal dosemeters in use at DOE facilities are capable of estimating <b>dose</b> <b>equivalents</b> for high energy neutrons to within a factor of at least 2 or 3. If a field-specific calibration factor is used to correct the <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> responses, the agreement with the reference <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> for these dosemeters can be improved to better than about 25 to 65 at is decoupled from the core in /sup 183, 185 /Au, becomes the 3 / 2 [532] state (h 9 / 2 parentage) strongly coupled in the doubly-odd /sup 184 /Au nucleus.
