50|$|There is a {{pressure}} gradient from {{the perimeter of}} the bowl or cup toward the center. This pressure gradient provides the centripetal force necessary for the circular motion of each parcel of water. The pressure gradient also accounts for a secondary flow of the boundary layer in the water flowing across the floor of the bowl or cup. The slower speed of the water in the boundary layer is unable to balance the pressure gradient. The boundary layer spirals inward toward the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>circulation</b> of the water. On reaching the center the secondary flow is then upward toward the surface, progressively mixing with the primary flow. Near the surface there may also be a slow secondary flow outward toward the perimeter.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason the}} {{rotation}} of the Earth in relation to the pendulum swing increases in time (decreases in effect) with decreasing latitude is related to the Coriolis Effect.

The Coriolis effect decreases nearer the equator because the surface of the Earth is parallel to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> rotation (the central <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the pendulum is perpendicular with the Earth's <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> rotation).

40|$|Principal {{component}} (PC) maps, which plot {{the values}} of a given PC estimated {{on the basis of}} allele frequency variation at the geographic sampling locations of a set of populations, are often used to investigate the properties of past range expansions. Some studies have argued that in a range expansion, the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> greatest variation (i. e., the first PC) is parallel to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> expansion. In contrast, others have identified a pattern in which the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> greatest variation is perpendicular to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> expansion. Here, we seek to understand this difference in outcomes by investigating the effect of the geographic sampling scheme on the direction <b>of</b> the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> greatest variation under a two-dimensional range expansion model. From datasets simulated using each of two different schemes for the geographic sampling of populations under the model, we create PC maps for the first PC. We find that depending on the geographic sampling scheme, the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> greatest variation can be either parallel or perpendicular to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> expansion. We provide an explanation for this result in terms of intra- and interpopulation coalescence times. Key words: <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> variation, range expansion, synthetic maps...|$|R

The Laplace plane arises because the equatorial oblateness of the parent planet tends to cause the orbit of the satellite to precess around the polar <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the parent planet's equatorial plane, while the solar perturbations tend to cause the orbit of the satellite to precess around the polar <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the parent planet's orbital plane around the Sun.
