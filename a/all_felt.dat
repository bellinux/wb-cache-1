5|$|Nothhelm died on 17 October 739. and {{was buried}} in Canterbury Cathedral. He is {{considered}} a saint, and his feast day is 17 October. The antiquaries and writers John Leland, John Bale, and Thomas Tanner <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> that Nothhelm {{was the author of}} various works, but later research has shown them to be authored by other writers. A verse eulogy for Nothhelm, of uncertain date, survives in a 16th-century manuscript now at the Lambeth Palace library.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{felt that}} the legend on the obverse named a 6th-century bishop of Autun, but D. B. Haigh as well as C. H. V. Sutherland, Arthur Evans, and G. C. Brooke <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> that it {{referred}} to Liudhard, a Frankish bishop who accompanied the Frankish princess Bertha to Kent in the late 6th century when the Christian Bertha married the then pagan King Æthelberht of Kent. Liudhard died probably in the late 590s.|$|E

25|$|The {{first and}} last of these motives {{animated}} the foot-soldiers of the Royal armies. These sturdy rustics who followed their squires to the war, saw the enemy as rebels and fanatics. The cavalry was composed largely of the higher social orders. The rebel troops {{on the other hand}} were mainly drawn from the ranks of the middle class or bourgeois. The various groups of mercenary troops or soldiers of fortune seeking employ {{on either side of the}} conflict since the end the German wars <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> the well hardened regulars' contempt for citizen militia.|$|E
25|$|The second Test {{match was}} {{restricted}} to 105 minutes of play, rain and poor pitch conditions accounting for the rest. Australia were suffering from the same ill health that had weakened the team before and during their match in Cambridge; Trumble and Howell had influenza, while Darling, Noble and Saunders <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> ill, though did {{take part in the}} game. Saunders thus replaced Howell in the playing eleven. England went in with the same eleven that had played in Birmingham, with Tom Taylor as twelfth man.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} the name change, drummer Doug Sandom was {{replaced}} by Keith Moon, who had been drumming semi-professionally with the Beachcombers for several years. The band was soon taken on by a mod publicist named Peter Meaden who convinced them to change their name to the High Numbers to give the band more of a mod feel. After bringing out one failed single ("I'm the Face/Zoot Suit"), they dropped Meaden and were signed on by two new managers, Chris Stamp and Kit Lambert, who had paired up {{with the intention of}} finding new talent and creating a documentary about them. The band anguished over a name that <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> represented the band best, and dropped the High Numbers name, reverting to the Who. In June 1964, during a performance at the Railway Tavern, Townshend accidentally broke the top of his guitar on the low ceiling and proceeded to destroy the entire instrument. The on-stage destruction of instruments soon became a regular part of the Who's live shows.|$|E

5000|$|In 1921, {{with the}} {{formation}} of the Irish Free State, six counties in the northeast remained in the United Kingdom as Northern Ireland. It is predominately religion, historical, and political differences that divide the two communities of (nationalism and unionism). Four polls taken between 1989 and 1994 revealed that when asked to state their national identity, over 79% of Northern Irish Protestants replied [...] "British" [...] or [...] "Ulster" [...] with 3% or less replying [...] "Irish", while over 60% of Northern Irish Catholics replied [...] "Irish" [...] with 13% or less replying [...] "British" [...] or [...] "Ulster". A survey in 1999 showed that 72% of Northern Irish Protestants considered themselves [...] "British" [...] and 2% [...] "Irish", with 68% of Northern Irish Catholics considering themselves [...] "Irish" [...] and 9% [...] "British". The survey also revealed that 78% of Protestants and 48% of <b>all</b> respondents <b>felt</b> [...] "Strongly British", while 77% of Catholics and 35% of <b>all</b> respondents <b>felt</b> [...] "Strongly Irish". 51% of Protestants and 33% of <b>all</b> respondents <b>felt</b> [...] "Not at all Irish", while 62% of Catholics and 28% of <b>all</b> respondents <b>felt</b> [...] "Not at all British".|$|R

500|$|... "Tearjerker" [...] was {{a tribute}} to Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain. Kiedis felt Cobain's death [...] "was an {{emotional}} blow, and we <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> it. I don't know why everyone on earth felt so close to that guy; he was beloved and endearing and inoffensive in some weird way. For all of his screaming {{and all of his}} darkness, he was just lovable." [...] "My Friends" [...] addressed more of Kiedis' own somber thoughts rather than those of [...] "his friends": [...] "My friends are so distressed/And standing on the brink of emptiness/No words I know of to express/This emptiness." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hairography" [...] was {{watched by}} 6.1 million US viewers and {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal deemed the mash-up performance {{one of the}} worst of the season, with Zap2it's Liz Pardue agreeing that it was [...] "hideous". Flandez, Pardue and Mike Hale of The New York Times <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> that it was inappropriate for New Directions to interrupt the deaf choir's performance of [...] "Imagine", however Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle opined that reviewers needed to [...] "realize that this show takes its jabs at everyone, but it always has a wink and a hug and lots and lots of love behind it".|$|E
500|$|Production on {{the episode}} officially began in October 2011 at Los Angeles, California, {{after several months}} of {{research}} and development. The animators worked closely with executive producer Paul Tibbitt, creator Stephen Hillenburg, and creative director Vincent Waller to ensure the cartoon characters were properly translated into three-dimensional puppets. Hillenburg and Tibbitt provided hands-on feedback on the production on a weekly basis. [...] "They'd check out the weeklies and {{go back and forth}} with us on the various gags [...] It was really a pleasurable experience when they came to visit, because we come from the same planet. It <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> very easy and natural," [...] Walsh said.|$|E
6000|$|She said nothing. Her head drooped. She, who had blandly {{been his}} manager <b>all</b> day, <b>felt</b> managed when his [...] "Will you?" [...] pierced her, {{made her a}} woman.|$|R
3000|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} that <b>all</b> participants <b>felt</b> positive and {{encouraged by the}} STEM-PjBL approach with a strong determination to apply it in their future teaching. Sample responses include: [...]...|$|R
30|$|All {{students}} {{highlighted the}} fact that radiology teaching was non-existent or very scarce in the first 2  years at medical school and over half of <b>all</b> students <b>felt</b> this was too little.|$|R
500|$|Furniss {{found that}} the {{gameplay}} changes compared to the original Metroid II, {{such as the ability}} to grab onto ledges, <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> natural, and called the user interface [...] "sleek". He liked the log system, calling it one of the biggest additions, and enjoyed how the opening added more story content while not being [...] "overdone", instead feeling like the opening to Super Metroid. Holmes commended the boss battles, calling them [...] "arguably" [...] the best across all 2D Metroid games. Ponce found the precise win conditions for Metroid battles annoying considering how often they are fought, but similarly thought that the new non-Metroid bosses were among the most exciting and challenging in all 2D games in the series. His favorite new gameplay elements were the [...] "gimmicks" [...] such as the player-operated tunneling drill machine and the walker robot minigame.|$|E
500|$|He continued, [...] "It <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> like {{a perfect}} fit. What's great about the scene, too, is there's hardly any dialogue. It's nine minutes long. I knew I had to start minimal and give it space. Let notes ring, then give it space, and build up the {{anticipation}} from there, without tipping in either direction." [...] Djawadi stated that he refrained from using the typical Lannister theme, [...] "The Rains of Castamere", {{in order to create}} more of a mystery. The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison, with Djawadi describing how he pieced all of the separate pieces of the music together by saying [...] "The boys I recorded completely separate. The strings I recorded all together. Even the solo instruments, I recorded them separately — the solo violins and solo cellists were recorded separately. The piano, I played. And the organ as well." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} the first to feature flashbacks with Sayid, an Arab character. The {{producers}} knew they had to tread carefully with the character due to possible prejudices against Arabs. The actor, Naveen Andrews, said, [...] "we were all pretty nervous, {{in the sense that we}} <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> we owed a real obligation, not just to Iraqis but the entire Arab world about how this character would be played." [...] In an early draft of [...] "Solitary", Rousseau told Sayid that she and her research team were studying time. When ABC saw this draft, they asked the producers to remove this line, explaining that they did not want the show to venture into science fiction during the first season. The character of Sullivan, to whose medical woes Jack tended, was created to make the rest of the survivors think that Rousseau's team was killed by an illness. The idea for Hurley's golf course came from script coordinator Brent Fletcher; it was based on a miniature golf course he created in the offices for the television show Angel.|$|E
6000|$|At last {{he stopped}} suddenly, {{when he saw}} that the animal {{excitement}} was at the very highest; and called on <b>all</b> who <b>felt</b> [...] "convinced" [...] to come forward and confess their sins.|$|R
60|$|But {{the young}} man grew weary. He came more rarely to Locquignol, and very soon he did not come at <b>all.</b> Renelde <b>felt</b> as if her heart would break, but she held firm.|$|R
6000|$|Carrie {{laughed and}} {{the hint of}} strain <b>all</b> had <b>felt</b> vanished. [...] "You are {{certainly}} the hustling Jim we knew," [...] she said. [...] "I feel {{as if we were}} back in the woods." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{success of}} the album brought wealth to all {{four members of the}} band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a {{collector}} of upmarket cars. Some of the profits were invested in the production of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. [...] Engineer Alan Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for The Dark Side of the Moon, and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with the Alan Parsons Project. [...] Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the {{success of the}} album, Mason has praised his role. [...] In 2003, Parsons reflected: [...] "I think they <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it. [...] But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hidden Place" [...] was {{directed}} by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin and co-directed by M/M (Paris). It was shot in London over four days in February 2001. It was originally planned for a song from Selmasongs, but Björk felt the project was more appropriate for Vespertine. The video consists of close-up shots panning around Björk's face, as fluids flow {{in and out of}} her facial orifices. M/M (Paris) explained the concept behind the video:We always wanted to get as close to her as we could, as we <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> she had never been portrayed as the [...] "real" [...] and beautiful woman she is. This is somehow taboo, to observe a pop star with no makeup from a distance of half an inch. Then the idea of the liquid works as a visualization of all possible emotions pulsating and circulating in her very busy brain. The loop idea was a main point for us as well, trying to extend the usual time frame of pop video super-fast editing, to make it hypnotising, mesmerising and irritating, like an eternally burning fireplace.|$|E
500|$|Hershiser picked Roberto Alomar off {{at first}} base to end the eighth inning. When the game went into extra innings, Hershiser {{did not want to}} continue: [...] "I really didn't want to break it", Hershiser said. [...] "I wanted to stop at 58. I wanted me and Don to be {{together}} at the top. But the higher sources (Lasorda and Perranoski) told me they weren't taking me out of the game, so I figured, what the heck, I might as well get the guy out." [...] Through the first nine innings, no Padre had reached second base. Lasorda, Perranoski and Ben Hines <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> he owed it to the game and to himself to continue. Hershiser made it through the tenth inning, with the record-setting out being a Keith Moreland flyball caught by right fielder José González. However, he had some close calls in a couple of innings. Marvell Wynne struck out swinging to open the inning, but reached first base after a wild pitch evaded [...] catcher Mike Scioscia. The following two hitters, Santiago and Randy Ready, moved Wynne over to third with two outs. Then, Garry Templeton was given an intentional base on balls. Templeton advanced to second base before the final out was recorded.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, I {{liked her}} today. A little or much? Don't know. I liked her {{and it seems}} a new feeling to me. Then, in that case, all the rest, all that I thought I thought and <b>all</b> that I <b>felt</b> I <b>felt,</b> <b>all</b> the rest before now, in fact... O, give it up, old chap! Sleep it off! ...|$|R
60|$|Philip {{uttered a}} cry of loathing horror, and turned white; Berenger, above <b>all</b> else, <b>felt</b> a sort of frenzied despair as {{he thought of the}} peril of the boy who had been trusted to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Jess, {{with a sigh}} of relief. So {{that was}} <b>all?</b> She <b>felt</b> as though a ton-weight had been lifted from her heart. She had {{expected}} this bit of news for some time.|$|R
500|$|Staff writer Tracy Tormé was {{not pleased}} with the [...] "1940s tribal Africa" [...] theme of the aliens, and because the combat scene {{towards the end of}} the episode resembled the Kirk versus Spock fight in [...] episode [...] "Amok Time". Fellow Star Trek writer Maurice Hurley said that it was [...] "a good idea, but the {{execution}} just fell apart. Again, if you take that script and if the actors had been told to give it a different twist, that show would have been different. But it became too baroque and fell apart. But the concept of having a guy say 'I have to have somebody kill my wife and this is the person' is a good idea." [...] Some of the cast, including Jonathan Frakes, sought to prevent the episode from being re-aired. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2012, Patrick Stewart agreed with fans that considered the season 2 episode [...] "" [...] to be [...] "the first truly great episode of the series", stating that the first season [...] "had several quite weak episodes"; referring to [...] "Code of Honor" [...] in particular he said, [...] "I can think of one very early on that involved a race of black aliens that we <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> quite embarrassed about." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} stated that {{following}} the troublesome final years signed to Geffen Records, being an independent act again helped improve their mood and approach, with Vig remarking, [...] "There were no expectations; {{no one even}} knew we were recording. So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form. You can't keep treating it like sausage meat. You have to let it morph and move and breathe." ...|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the episode. Jane Simon of Daily Mirror said that [...] "White Bear" [...] lacked the [...] "instant emotional tug" [...] of the series opener. She commented that, {{a third of the}} way through the episode, she had lost hope that it would conclude effectively, [...] " [...] the acting was unbelievable, the script was riddled with horror-film cliches, the violence was a bit over the top [...] ", but that by the end she was positively surprised. Joyner praised it as [...] "stylistically ... breath-taking" [...] with [...] "intense action", but felt [...] "the themes come across as particularly flat" [...] and [...] "hardly original". He was disappointed until the twist, and concludes that Brooker has [...] "crafted an hour of television more bold and daring than I've seen in a long time". Jeffery said [...] "this is Black Mirror as full-blooded horror" [...] and that it never gets boring, while criticized the characters and the final sequence as [...] "a little overlong and obvious". TheWrap staff was divided; while some found it has a good social critique, others considered it to be [...] "least effective when it goes for horror". Although Parker compared the first 45 minutes to [...] "a low-budget, low-quality version of 28 Days Later", full of [...] "horror movie clichés", he realised that was [...] "the whole point". He was positive to its societal criticism and wrote: [...] "So the reason it <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> like a rubbish horror movie for 45 minutes is because that's what it was, just with a real person in the centre of it." [...] It was ranked eleventh out of the thirteen episodes by Charles Bramesco of Vulture, who said its message is [...] "lost beneath a simplistic twist that pulls a switcheroo and [...] fails to do much else".|$|E
6000|$|So he was {{not going}} to ask her after <b>all.</b> Violet <b>felt</b> piqued. She was also {{conscious}} of a sensation very near akin to disappointment. She looked across at Madison. How trim and dapper he was! ...|$|R
60|$|Then we {{all looked}} at one another. We were a pretty pale lot, and I believe that Rectus and I, who were <b>all</b> right, <b>felt</b> almost as badly as the four other boys, who were all wrong.|$|R
60|$|Of course I didn't feel it. <b>All</b> I <b>felt</b> {{was that}} someone dealt me a {{powerful}} blow {{in the face}} with a sledgehammer. After that somebody took a pickax and cracked in my jaw with it. That was all.|$|R
