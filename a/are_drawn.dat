5|$|Free-body {{diagrams}} {{can be used}} as {{a convenient}} way to keep track of forces acting on a system. Ideally, these diagrams <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> with the angles and relative magnitudes of the force vectors preserved so that graphical vector addition can be done to determine the net force.|$|E
5|$|Green Street (2005) â€“ Elijah Wood {{plays an}} American student who gets {{involved}} with West Ham's firm. The film builds up {{to a big}} clash with Millwall's firm at the climax, after the two teams <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> {{against each other in}} the Cup, foreshadowing similarities to the 2009 Upton Park riot.|$|E
5|$|In another drawing style, the {{circular}} layout, the vertices of a graph {{are placed on}} a circle and the edges <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> either inside or outside the circle. Again, a placement of the edges within the circle (for instance as straight line segments) corresponds to a one-page book drawing, while a placement {{both inside and outside}} the circle corresponds to a two-page book drawing.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} stage, the 16 {{teams from the}} South Zone <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> into eight ties, and the 16 teams from the North Zone <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> into the other eight ties. Teams which {{qualified}} for berths 1 <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> against teams which qualified for berths 4, and teams which qualified for berths 2 <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> against teams which qualified for berths 3, with the former hosting the second leg in both cases. Teams from the same association could not <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> into the same tie.|$|R
50|$|On 16 June 2015, {{the first}} round <b>draw</b> <b>was</b> made, Ipswich Town <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> at home against Stevenage. Ipswich Town <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> away to Doncaster Rovers in the second round.

5|$|Lemoine {{also proved}} that if lines <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> through the Lemoine point {{parallel}} {{to the sides of}} the triangle, then the six points of intersection of the lines and the sides of the triangle are concyclic, or that they lie on a circle. This circle is now known as the first Lemoine circle, or simply the Lemoine circle.|$|E
5|$|Lower Man. The {{mountain}} has two tops, {{which used}} to be distinguished as Helvellyn Low Man (or Lower Man) and Helvellyn High Man (or Higher Man). Both <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> and labelled on a panoramic view of the range found in Jonathan Otley's guidebook of 1823.|$|E
5|$|A high {{percentage}} of ADF personnel <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> from the Anglo-Celtic portion of Australia's population. In 2011 the proportion of ADF personnel born in Australia and the other predominately Anglo-Celtic countries was higher than this population group's share of both the Australian workforce and overall population. As a result, analyst Mark Thomson {{has argued that the}} ADF is unrepresentative of Australia's society in this regard and that recruiting more personnel from other ethnic backgrounds would improve the ADF's language skills and cultural empathy.|$|E
50|$|Each group {{contained}} {{one team}} from Pot 1, one team from Pot 2, and one team from Pot 3. For political reasons, Russia and Ukraine could not <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> {{in the same}} group or in groups scheduled to be played {{on the same day}} (due to a potential clash of teams and clash of fans). Therefore, if Russia <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group B, Ukraine had to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group C or D, and if Russia <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group C or D, Ukraine had to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group A or B.|$|R

Two versions of each oval, square, or triangle <b>are</b> then <b>drawn.</b> A black colored shape <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> where the stencil buffer is 1, and a white shape <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> where the buffer is 0.|$|R
50|$|Teams {{from the}} same {{confederation}} <b>were</b> not <b>drawn</b> into the same group, therefore Egypt <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> into Group B. Also as result, Italy and Spain <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> into different groups.|$|R
5|$|A surface weather {{analysis}} {{is a type}} of weather map that depicts positions for high and low-pressure areas, as well as various types of synoptic scale systems such as frontal zones. Isotherms can be drawn on these maps, which are lines of equal temperature. Isotherms <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> normally as solid lines at a preferred temperature interval. They show temperature gradients, which can be useful in finding fronts, which are on the warm side of large temperature gradients. By plotting the freezing line, isotherms can be useful in determination of precipitation type. Mesoscale boundaries such as tropical cyclones, outflow boundaries and squall lines also are analyzed on surface weather analyses.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E
5|$|Athletes will {{sometimes}} become citizens {{of a different}} nation so {{they are able to}} compete in the Olympics. This is often because they <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> to sponsorships or training facilities in such places as the United States. It could also be because an athlete is unable to qualify from within their original country. The athlete may not qualify because there are already qualified athletes in the athlete's home country. Between 1992 and 2008, about fifty athletes emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.|$|E
5000|$|Clip {{regions are}} {{commonly}} specified to improve render performance. A well-chosen clip allows the renderer {{to save time}} and energy by skipping calculations related to pixels that the user cannot see. Pixels that will <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>are</b> said to be within the clip region. Pixels that will not <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>are</b> outside the clip region. More informally, pixels that will not <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>are</b> said to be [...] "clipped." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{opening and}} ending scenes <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> by Mizushima; the scene {{involving}} {{the debut of}} the film's villain <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Soichi Masui; the middle section of the film <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Shingo Kaneko; Edward Elric's return to his homeworld <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Masahiro Ando; action scenes <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> by Shinji Aramaki; and the battle between Wrath and Gluttony <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Yutaka Nakamura. Mizushima was repeatedly harassed by the head employees at Aniplex to speed up work on the storyboards. The artwork for the film was produced once Kaneko was finished and cel-animation was used to produce several characters or items in the film. Seven hundred of the film's animated frames had to be redone with only two weeks to the film's release.|$|R
50|$|The {{first round}} <b>draw</b> <b>was</b> made on 8 August 2015, by Women's World Cup bronze medalists Toni Duggan and Alex Scott. Morecambe <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> {{at home against}} Walsall. On 5 September 2015, the second round <b>draw</b> <b>was</b> made by Charlie Austin and Ed Skrein. Morecambe <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> away to Bury. The draw for the area quarter-finals was made on 10 October 2015. Morecambe <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> away to Rochdale. The draw for the area semi-finals was made on 14 November 2015, by John Hartson and Paul Heaton. Morecambe <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> away to Fleetwood Town. All the <b>draws</b> <b>were</b> shown live on Soccer AM.|$|R
5|$|Curtis Silver, in a {{retrospective}} for Wired, collected anecdotes from They Might Be Giants fans, {{many of whom}} were first exposed to the band through Flood. Silver concluded that new fans <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> just as much to the band's old material as they are their more recent work, due to its sustaining accessibility. In fact, many fans cite the band's earliest albums as their favoritesâ€”though often not Flood, despite (or perhaps due to) its longstanding mainstream success.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VIII is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Square for the PlayStation console. Released in 1999, it is the eighth main installment in the Final Fantasy series. Set on an unnamed fantasy world with science fiction elements, the game follows {{a group of young}} mercenaries, led by Squall Leonhart, as they <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> into a conflict sparked by the sorceress Edea. After defeating Edea, the protagonists learn that she was under the control of Ultimecia, a sorceress from the future who wishes to compress time. During the quest to defeat Ultimecia, Squall struggles with his role as leader and develops a romance with one of his comrades, Rinoa Heartilly.|$|E
5|$|Finn wanders {{all over}} Ooo until {{he manages to}} locate Jake, who is {{fulfilling}} a bizarre lifelong ambition of being a brick inside a shack as it collapses. Finn expresses his support, but decides {{to head back to}} the Tree Fort. He leaves a walkie talkie with Jake. After a period of time passes, Jake begins absentmindedly narrating the events around him. Finn and BMO <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> into Jake's storytelling, and Finn uses Starchy's radio station to broadcast Jake's narration.|$|E
50|$|On 16 June 2015, {{the first}} round <b>draw</b> <b>was</b> made, Sheffield United <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> away against Morecambe. In the second round, the Blades <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> away to Fulham.|$|R
5|$|Daily draw games include Pick 3, Pick 4, and Cash 5; each {{of which}} <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> twice daily. The Virginia Lottery also offers {{numerous}} scratchers. It is one of 46 lotteries which sells Mega Millions tickets, and one of 47 offering Powerball. Cash4Life <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> Mondays and Thursdays; Mega Millions <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> Tuesdays and Fridays, while Powerball <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> Wednesdays and Saturdays. Bank A Million <b>is</b> also <b>drawn</b> Wednesdays and Saturdays. The Lottery maintains elaborate security procedures to protect the integrity of its games.|$|R
25|$|Every graph {{that can}} <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> {{on a plane}} can <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> on the sphere as well, and vice versa.|$|R
5|$|Food webs exhibit {{principles}} of ecological emergence through {{the nature of}} trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). Theoretical and empirical studies identify non-random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step lines or relations <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> until a web of life is illustrated.|$|E
5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines {{a few inches}} from the corners, the entire table is divided into {{rectangular}} balk spaces, by drawing balklines a certain distance lengthwise and widthwise across the length of the table a set number of inches parallel out from each rail. This divides the table into eight rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E
5|$|Later, Stottlemeyer and Disher {{watch the}} film's {{shooting}} and Natalie's prediction is right: Ruskin has impersonated Monk {{to the point}} that he is unable to complete the sequence because he is hassled by the setting's disorder. He leaves the studio, goes to Monk's house to know what are his reasons to do his job, and explores Monk's files on Trudy's murder, grieving Monk. An afflicted Monk goes to Natalie's house, where he solves the case when he sees torn paper by Julie to prevent Natalie from reading it. The pawnshop is adjacent to a restaurant, where clients <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> on the wall. On the crime's night, Leverett and Cullman were sketched and Leverett tried to destroy the evidence.|$|E
25|$|France and the Republic of Ireland did {{not meet}} in the {{qualifying}} matches for the 2012 European Championships. France <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group D while Ireland <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group B, although they <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> together in the practice run for the draw held the day before.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{previous}} editions where teams <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> {{with a clear}} {{route to}} the final, clubs will now <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> on a round-by-round basis.
