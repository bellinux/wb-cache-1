5|$|Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, {{can detect}} the {{changing}} levels of cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate {{it is getting}} close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> rabbits are born, the fleas make their way down to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make {{their way back to}} the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.|$|E
5|$|The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), {{also known}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baby,</b> was {{designed}} as a test-bed for the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory, rather than as a practical computer. Work on the machine began in 1947, and on 21 June 1948 the computer successfully ran its first program, consisting of 17 instructions written to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) by trying every integer from 218 − 1 downwards. The program ran for 52minutes before producing the correct answer of 131,072.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the birth}} of Catherine, Maud {{gave birth to a}} son shortly after her {{marriage}} to Sir Thomas.

After {{the birth of}} their third child, Anne, Maud again became pregnant c. 1517, the same year of Thomas' death. The baby was either lost through a miscarriage, stillbirth, or death in early infancy.

25|$|Assurances {{that this}} {{condition}} will clear <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> matures are very common. However, {{studies have shown}} that the condition occasionally persists into the toddler years, and less commonly into later childhood. It tends to recur in adolescence and persists into adulthood. In an Australian study, about 15 percent of previously diagnosed children still had eczema 10 years later. Sometimes, cradle cap turns into atopic dermatitis. Rarely, it turns out to be misdiagnosed psoriasis.|$|E
25|$|The newborn {{marsupial}} {{uses its}} forelimbs (with relatively strong hands) {{to climb to}} a nipple, which is usually in a pouch on the mother's belly. The mother feeds the baby by contracting muscles over her mammary glands, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> is too weak to suck. The newborn marsupial's need to use its forelimbs in climbing to the nipple was historically thought to have restricted metatherian evolution, as {{it was assumed that}} the forelimb couldn't become specialised intro structures like wings, hooves or flippers. However, several bandicoots, most notably the pig-footed bandicoot, have true hooves similar to those of placental ungulates, and several marsupial gliders have evolved.|$|E
25|$|At 14, Riabouchinska {{was chosen}} by Nikita Balieff to join his Franco-Russian {{vaudeville}} troupe, Le Théâtre de la Chauve-Souris (The Bat Theater), often billed simply as La Chauve-Souris. In the 1931 edition of their revue, which featured Russian songs, dances, and comedy numbers, she appeared in two short ballets, Diana Hunts the Stag and The Romantic Adventures of an Italian Ballerina and a Marquis. In Paris, she was seen by choreographer and ballet master George Balanchine, who quickly signed her for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, then being organized by Colonel Wassily de Basil and his associates. She joined that company after the American tour of La Chauve-Souris. She and two other young dancers in the company became known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> Ballerinas.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{cultures}} {{believe the}} placenta {{to be or}} have been alive, often a relative of <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> Nepalese think of <b>the</b> placenta <b>as</b> {{a friend of the}} baby; Malaysian Orang Asli regard it <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> older sibling. Native Hawaiians believe that the placenta is a part of <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> and traditionally plant it with a tree that can then grow alongside the child. [...] Various cultures in Indonesia, such as Javanese, believe that the placenta has a spirit and needs to be buried outside the family house.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} begin the birth, descent of podalic pole along with {{compaction}} and internal rotation needs to occur. This happens when the mother's pelvic floor muscles cause <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to turn {{so that it can}} be born with one hip directly in front of the other. At this point <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> is facing one of the mother's inner thighs. Then, the shoulders follow <b>the</b> same path <b>as</b> <b>the</b> hips did. At this time <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> usually turns to face the mother's back. Next occurs external rotation, which is when <b>the</b> shoulders emerge <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby’s</b> head enters <b>the</b> maternal pelvis. The combination of maternal muscle tone and uterine contractions cause <b>the</b> <b>baby’s</b> head to flex, chin to chest. Then the back of <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> head emerges and finally the face.|$|R
25|$|There is {{one final}} matter to consider: the {{possibility}} that euthanasia not only would be performed on incompetent patients {{in violation of the}} rules—as an abuse of the safeguards—but would become the rule in the context of demographic and budgetary pressures on Social Security and Medicare <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> Boom generation begins to retire, around 2010. Once legalized, physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia would become routine. Over time doctors would become comfortable giving injections to end life and Americans would become comfortable having euthanasia as an option. Comfort would make us want to extend the option to others who, in society's view, are suffering and leading purposeless lives. The ethical arguments for physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia, advocates of euthanasia have maintained, do not apply to euthanasia only when it is voluntary; they {{can also be used to}} justify some kinds of nonvoluntary euthanasia of the incompetent.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{techniques}} used to examine how infants perceive speech, besides the head-turn procedure mentioned above, is measuring their sucking rate. In such an experiment, a baby is sucking a special nipple while presented with sounds. First, the baby's normal sucking rate is established. Then a stimulus is played repeatedly. When the baby hears the stimulus {{for the first time}} the sucking rate increases but <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> becomes habituated to the stimulation the sucking rate decreases and levels off. Then, a new stimulus is played to the baby. If the baby perceives the newly introduced stimulus as different from the background stimulus the sucking rate will show an increase. The sucking-rate and the head-turn method are some of the more traditional, behavioral methods for studying speech perception. Among the new methods (see Research methods below) that help us to study speech perception, near-infrared spectroscopy is widely used in infants.|$|E
25|$|Paul seizes this {{opportunity}} to give his sister a baby in a storyline that becomes known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> switch. He drugs Babe, puts her in a helicopter, and stages a helicopter crash near a river in the forest. When Babe awakens, Paul tells her that the helicopter crashed and her baby is dead. She loses consciousness again. When Adam Chandler and JR arrive at the scene and threaten Paul, should anything bad have happened to their heir, Paul twists his story around and tells them that it was Bianca's baby that fell into the river and that Babe's child survived. JR's family is elated that Babe's baby is alive, but Bianca's family is devastated by the news. In Llanview, Paul gives Kelly Babe's son (later known as Adam Chandler III, then Little Adam, and currently AJ), telling her that the boy's mother was a poor homeless woman {{who did not want}} a baby.|$|E

50|$|Episiotomy {{is done in}} {{an effort}} to prevent against soft-tissue tearing which may involve the anal {{sphincter}} and rectum. Vaginal tears can occur during childbirth, most often at <b>the</b> vaginal opening <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> head passes through, especially if <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> descends quickly. Tears can involve the perineal skin or extend to the muscles and the anal sphincter and anus. The midwife or obstetrician may decide to make a surgical cut to the perineum with scissors or a scalpel to make <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> birth easier and prevent severe tears that can be difficult to repair. The cut is repaired with stitches (sutures). Some childbirth facilities have a policy of routine episiotomy.|$|R
25|$|The {{first phase}} of postmodernity {{overlaps}} the end of modernity and is regarded by many as {{being part of the}} modern period (see lumpers/splitters, periodization). Television became the primary news source, manufacturing decreased in importance in the economies of Western Europe and the United States but trade volumes increased within the developed core. In 1967–1969 a crucial cultural explosion took place within the developed world <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> boom generation, which had grown up with postmodernity as its fundamental experience of society, demanded entrance into the political, cultural and educational power structure. A series of demonstrations and acts of rebellion – ranging from nonviolent and cultural, through violent acts of terrorism – represented the opposition of the young to the policies and perspectives of the previous age. Opposition to the Algerian War and the Vietnam War, to laws allowing or encouraging racial segregation and to laws which overtly discriminated against women and restricted access to divorce, increased use of marijuana and psychedelics, the emergence of pop cultural styles of music and drama, including rock music and the ubiquity of stereo, television and radio helped make these changes visible in the broader cultural context. This period is associated with the work of Marshall McLuhan, a philosopher who focused on the results of living in a media culture and argued that participation in a mass media culture both overshadows actual content disseminated and is liberating because it loosens the authority of local social normative standards.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal diagnosis: Used {{to detect}} {{changes in a}} fetus's genes or {{chromosomes}} before birth. This type of testing is offered to couples with {{an increased risk of}} having a baby with a genetic or chromosomal disorder. In some cases, prenatal testing can lessen a couple's uncertainty or help them decide whether to abort the pregnancy. It cannot identify all possible inherited disorders and birth defects, however. One method of performing a prenatal genetic test involves an amniocentesis, which removes a sample of fluid from the mother’s amniotic sac 15 to 20 or more weeks into pregnancy. The fluid is then tested for chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) and Trisomy 18, which can result in neonatal or fetal death. Test results can be retrieved within 7–14 days after the test is done. This method is 99.4% accurate at detecting and diagnosing fetal chromosome abnormalities. Although there is a risk of miscarriage associated with an amniocentesis, the miscarriage rate is only 1/400. Another method of prenatal testing is Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS). Chorionic villi are projections from the placenta that carry the same genetic makeup <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> During this method of prenatal testing, a sample of chorionic villi is removed from the placenta to be tested. This test is performed 10–13 weeks into pregnancy and results are ready 7–14 days after the test was done. Another test using blood taken from the fetal umbilical cord is percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling.|$|E
