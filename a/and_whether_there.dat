5|$|In {{its early}} stages, esophageal cancer {{may not have}} any {{symptoms}} at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> are any metastases {{in different parts of}} the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. Inserting a stent into the esophagus, or inserting a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. , the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Several {{conclusions}} {{were drawn}} from discussions between Patel and the CPS, Starmer said: (a) because Patel had not retained or sampled the three litres of fluid, no firm conclusions could be drawn {{about the nature of}} it; (b) for Tomlinson's death to have resulted so quickly from blood loss, there would have to have been a significant internal rupture; (c) Patel found no such rupture; (d) the later postmortems also found no visible rupture; and (e) because Patel was the only person to have examined Tomlinson's intact body, he was {{in the best position to}} judge the nature of the fluid, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was a rupture that could have caused it. This meant that Patel's evidence would significantly undermine the evidence of the second and third pathologists.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{presented}} the {{bill on the}} floor of the House of Representatives on April 6, 1918. He was quizzed by North Carolina's Claude Kitchin, who asked whether there had been a unanimous recommendation by the committee, whether McAdoo and Baker had approved the bill, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was precedent for a half dollar in honor of a state's centennial (there was not). Wheeler reassured Kitchin as to the unanimity of the committee, and the approval by the officials, but did not answer the centennial question definitively, instead citing instances of prior commemorative issues (the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Panama-Pacific commemorative coins). Ashbrook intervened, assuring Kitchin that his committee had unanimously approved it. Kitchin had no more questions, and the House approved the bill without a recorded vote.|$|E

25|$|Toxicity of {{contaminants}} is generally {{a function of}} concentration and exposure (dose), and therefore the effects increase with the ambient pressure. The consequence is that breathing gases for hyperbaric use must have proportionately lower acceptable limits for toxic contaminants compared to normal surface pressure use. The allowable concentration is also affected by whether the effect is cumulative <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is a threshold for acceptable long-term exposure.|$|E

25|$|Radiation therapy {{may be used}} {{to treat}} almost every type of solid tumor, {{including}} cancers of the brain, breast, cervix, larynx, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, skin, stomach, uterus, or soft tissue sarcomas. Radiation is also used to treat leukemia and lymphoma. Radiation dose to each site depends on a number of factors, including the radio sensitivity of each cancer type <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> are tissues and organs nearby that may be damaged by radiation. Thus, as with every form of treatment, radiation therapy is not without its side effects.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{treatment}} usually {{consists of}} the administration of corticosteroids, a group of medications that suppress the immune system. The dose and mode of administration is determined by platelet count <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is active bleeding: in urgent situations, infusions of dexamethasone or methylprednisolone may be used, while oral prednisone or prednisolone may suffice in less severe cases. Once the platelet count has improved, the dose of steroid is gradually reduced while the possibility of relapse is monitored. 60–90 percent will experience a relapse during dose reduction or cessation. Long-term steroids are avoided if possible because of potential side-effects that include osteoporosis, diabetes and cataracts.|$|E

25|$|Boardroom {{meetings}} generally {{proceed in}} three stages. In the preliminary stage, {{all of the}} remaining candidates on both teams gather in the boardroom to be briefed on the task by the host and his advisors. Team members are asked about how the task went <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> were any strong or weak players. Teams are sometimes asked to comment on materials or products produced by the opposing team. At {{the end of this}} stage, the host or his advisors reveal the results of the task and announce which team was the winner. The winning team wins a reward (usually a unique, luxurious experience) and are excused from the boardroom while the losing team returns to the boardroom for an elimination. In later seasons, winning teams have been permitted to view the next stage of the boardroom on the TV in their suite.|$|E
25|$|Auckland lawyer Peter Williams, engaged {{by representatives}} of Tuhoe, {{examined}} whether charges could be brought against police for the raids <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was a case for charges of wrongful imprisonment. Williams wrote to Police Commissioner Howard Broad, seeking compensation and a restoration of mana, but on 14 December announced he had received no reply and would represent thirty members of Tuhoe in a class action against the police. Broad had earlier however publicly apologised {{to the people of}} Ruatoki for the raids and acknowledged that the actions of his force might take decades to heal. According to TV3 Ruatoki residents wanted utu (reciprocity) in the form of Broad's resignation. The call for his resignation was echoed by the Māori Party and Global Peace and Justice Auckland. A hikoi protesting the raids and the Suppression of Terrorism Act left the Bay of Plenty on 12 November. The hikoi collected signatures for a petition that it presented to parliament when it arrived in Wellington two days later. On 13 November a group of concerned individuals placed an advertisement in the Dominion Post urging the government to withdraw the Suppression of Terrorism Bill. Signatories to the advertisement included Green Party leader Jeanette Fitzsimons and National Distribution Union leader Laila Harre.|$|E
