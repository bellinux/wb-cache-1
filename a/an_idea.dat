5000|$|Drowned in Sound stated It {{seemed like}} <b>a</b> good <b>idea</b> at the time. Good title, admittedly.

5000|$|The ruling continued:... {{the mere}} recitation of a generic {{computer}} cannot transform <b>a</b> patent-ineligible abstract <b>idea</b> into <b>a</b> patent-eligible invention. Stating <b>an</b> abstract <b>idea</b> “while adding the words ‘apply it’” {{is not enough}} for patent eligibility. Nor is limiting the use of <b>an</b> abstract <b>idea</b> “‘to <b>a</b> particular technological environment.’”. Stating <b>an</b> abstract <b>idea</b> while adding the words “apply it with a computer” simply combines those two steps, with the same deficient result. Thus, if a patent’s recitation of a computer amounts to a mere instruction to“implement” <b>an</b> abstract <b>idea</b> “on [...] [...] [...] a computer,” [...] that addition cannot impart patent eligibility.|$|R

Robert California (James Spader) makes a {{spontaneous}} visit and asks them {{to come up with}} Dunder Mifflin/Sabre's next big idea. However, the office fails to impress Robert with their ideas. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) details <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> he has about cookie placement in the vending machine, but Robert gets the impression that he is extremely clever and is speaking only in metaphors. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who has been annoyed the entire day with Kevin being creative and Robert rejecting his ideas, later tricks Kevin into explaining <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> he has involving the Big Mac, and Robert realizes that there was no subtext to Kevin's ideas.|$|E
