5|$|Antony's fleet {{sailed through}} {{the bay of}} Actium on the western coast of Greece in <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> attempt to break free of the naval blockade. It was there that Antony's fleet faced the much larger fleet of smaller, more maneuverable ships under commanders Agrippa and Gaius Sosius {{in the battle of}} Actium on 2 September 31BC. Antony and his {{remaining}} forces were spared only due to a last-ditch effort by Cleopatra's fleet that had been waiting nearby.|$|E

5|$|At 16:29, the Japanese dive bombers {{began their}} attacks. Although several {{attempted}} {{to set up}} to attack the Saratoga, they quickly shifted back to the nearer carrier, Enterprise. Thus, Enterprise {{was the target of}} almost the entire Japanese air attack. Several Wildcats followed the Vals into their attack dives, despite the intense anti-aircraft artillery fire from Enterprise and her screening warships, in <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> attempt to disrupt their attacks. As many as four Wildcats were shot down by U.S. anti-aircraft fire, as well as several Vals.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on the 13th, as Waller's army {{approached}} Alton, Crawford fled {{with the}} cavalry to Winchester, leaving Colonel Richardus Boles to defend Alton {{with only the}} infantry.

Boles was killed, along with most of his remaining men. The Parliamentarians won a clear victory, losing only a few men and taking many prisoners.|$|E
5|$|By 1986, {{the company}} was once again in serious {{financial}} trouble. During 1985 they had taken the show outside Quebec to a lukewarm response. In Toronto they performed {{in front of a}} 25% capacity crowd after not having enough money to properly market the show. Gilles Ste-Croix, dressed in a monkey suit, walked through downtown Toronto as <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> publicity stunt. A later stop in Niagara Falls turned out to be equally problematic.|$|E

5|$|During 1944, {{the balance}} of naval power in the Pacific decisively turned against Japan, and by early 1945, its fleet was much {{depleted}} and badly hobbled by critical fuel shortages in the home islands. In <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> attempt to slow the Allied advance, Yamato was dispatched on a one-way mission to Okinawa in April 1945, with orders to beach herself and fight until destroyed protecting the island. The task force was spotted south of Kyushu by US submarines and aircraft, and on 7 April 1945 she was sunk by American carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers {{with the loss of}} most of her crew.|$|E
5|$|Henry's men, {{the entire}} left wing, descended a bluff into {{the midst of}} several hundred Sauk and Fox warriors, and <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> bayonet and musket battle followed. Women and {{children}} fled the fight into the river, where many drowned immediately. The battle continued for 30 minutes before Atkinson came up with Dodge's center element, cutting off escape {{for many of the}} remaining Native warriors. Some warriors managed to escape the fight to a willow island, which was being peppered with canister shot and gunfire by Warrior.|$|E
5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> {{attempt to}} improve the {{situation}} and hamper British operations, a number of experienced night fighter commanders and pilots suggested restarting intruder operations over England. In 1940–41, German night fighters, lacking airborne radar sets and a means to locate them over Germany, had flown to British bomber bases and attempted to destroy RAF bombers as they returned from their missions. Adolf Hitler had ordered a cessation of these activities for propaganda and practical reasons but these operations had met with reasonable success in 1941 and it was felt they may do so again.|$|E

5|$|In the {{circumstances}} {{it was hardly}} possible for the new king to show adaptability or tolerance or diplomatic skill, which are the fruit of long experience in human relationships. Confronted with <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> and chaotic situation he met it instead with grim determination and implacable ferocity. Towards {{the end of his}} life, forfeiting the affection and loyalty even of his courtiers and family he became a lonely figure, isolated by suspicion and mistrust. But, in spite of all, the name of this great defender of the faith {{is one of the most}} memorable in Ethiopian history.|$|E

5|$|Morgan {{considered}} attacking Camp Morton, the prisoner-of-war camp in Indianapolis, to free {{more than}} 5,000 Confederate {{prisoners of war}} imprisoned there, but decided against it. Instead, his raiders turned abruptly east and began moving towards Ohio. With Indiana's militia in pursuit, Morgan's men continued to raid and pillage their way toward the Indiana-Ohio border, crossing into Ohio on July 13. By the time Morgan left Indiana, his raid had become <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> attempt to escape to the South. He was captured on July 26 in Ohio.|$|E

5|$|Nickell finally {{consented to}} a {{polygraph}} examination in November 1986. She failed it and investigators narrowed their focus to her even further; however, concrete evidence proving that Nickell had ever purchased or used cyanide was lacking, and despite their relative certainty that Stella Nickell had orchestrated the poisonings as either an elaborate cover-up for an insurance-motivated {{murder of her}} husband, or as <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> attempt to force her husband's death to be ruled an accident, to increase her insurance payout, {{they were unable to}} build a strong enough case to support an arrest.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 1942, the 7th Division left Egypt for Australia, sailing via Bombay, as the {{division}} {{was needed to}} fight against the Japanese. Kingsbury's battalion made landfall at Adelaide and continued to Melbourne by rail. The battalion arrived on 16 March, and was given a week's leave. After this, the battalion underwent training in Glen Innes, before camping in Yandina, Queensland. On 5 August, the battalion moved north to Brisbane, boarding a ship to Port Moresby to join the fighting in New Guinea, where a force of mostly Militia personnel were engaged in <b>a</b> <b>desperate</b> defensive action.|$|E
5|$|On {{the left}} {{flank of the}} XI Corps, the attack focused on Gen. Schimmelfennig's division. They were {{subjected}} to a deadly artillery crossfire from Rodes' and Early's batteries, and as they deployed they were attacked by Doles' infantry. Early's troops were able to employ a flanking attack and roll up the division from the right, and they fell back in confusion toward the town. <b>A</b> <b>desperate</b> counterattack by the 157th New York from von Amsberg's brigade was surrounded on three sides, causing it to suffer 307 casualties (75%).|$|E
