40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the financial crises in Argentina and Turkey {{in order to}} find out whether a set of six major macroeconomic indicators account for these crises or not. Evidence suggests that in Turkey, an increase in domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the 1992, 1994 and 2001 financial crises, whereas an increase in CPI <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> all crisis episodes. Similarly, a decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> all crises. A fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> financial crises in 1991, 1992 and 1994. An increase in M 1 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> only <b>with</b> the crisis in 1992 and a fall in the volume of exports relative to volume of imports <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the crisis in 1994. In Argentina, an increase in neither CPI nor domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> any of the financial crises. A decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> all crises, whereas a fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> financial crises in 1991 and 2000. An increase in M 1, on the other hand, <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the crises in 1993, 2000 and 2001...|$|R

Then 12∧20=4 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the set {2,3,4}∩{2,4,5}={2,4}, while 12∨20=60 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the set {2,3,4}∪{2,4,5}={2,3,4,5}, so the join and meet {{operations}} of the lattice correspond to union and intersection of sets.|$|R
30|$|From the HKT {{subfamily}} II, OsHKT 2; 1 gene {{had five}} SNPs in the promoter region showing {{association with the}} salt tolerance traits.

In OsHKT 2; 3 a total of 4 SNPs <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the salt tolerance traits. Of the two non-synonymous SNPs, S 1001 <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> potassium concentration in shoot (extracellular side) while S 761 <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> SPAD chlorophyll content (cytoplasmic side), both the SNPs resulted in Isoleucine to Threonine substitution at amino acid positions 157 and 77, respectively. In addition, one synonymous SNP S 2053 <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> SPAD chlorophyll content and another SNP S 356 in the intronic region <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> potassium concentration in shoot.

40|$|Sixty-one Burkholderia cepacia {{isolates}} {{from patients}} with cystic fibrosis (CF) and four plant isolates were screened for {{production of the}} siderophores salicylic acid (SA), pyochelin, cepabactin, and ornibactins and fingerprinted by a PCR-based randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method. Of the 24 RAPD types determined, 22 (92 %) <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> isolates that produced SA, 21 (87 %) <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> isolates that produced ornibactins, 15 (60 %) <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> isolates that produced pyochelin, and 3 (12 %) <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> isolates that produced cepabactin. Of the 24 RAPD types plus 2 phenotypic variants of types 1 and 9, 3 <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> isolates that produced all four siderophores, 8 <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> isolates that produced three siderophores, 12 <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> isolates that produced two siderophores, and 3 <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> isolates that produced only one siderophore.
