5|$|Jordan saves Ferris from Hammond {{after a brief}} showdown. Parallax arrives, consumes Hammond's {{entire life}} force, and then wreaks havoc on Coast City. After a fierce battle, Jordan lures Parallax away from Earth <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sun, {{destroying}} and killing Parallax. He loses consciousness after the battle and falls toward the sun, but is saved by Sinestro, Kilowog, and Tomar-Re.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Friedrich was rediscovered by the Norwegian art {{historian}} Andreas Aubert (1851–1913), whose writing initiated modern Friedrich scholarship, and by the Symbolist painters, who valued his visionary and allegorical landscapes. The Norwegian Symbolist Edvard Munch (1863–1944) would have seen Friedrich's work during a visit to Berlin in the 1880s. Munch's 1899 print The Lonely Ones echoes Friedrich's Rückenfigur (back figure), although in Munch's work the focus has shifted away from the broad landscape <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sense of dislocation between the two melancholy figures in the foreground.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Barton Fink is {{loosely based on}} Clifford Odets, a playwright from New York who in the 1930s joined the Group Theatre, a gathering of dramatists which included Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasberg. Their work emphasized social issues and employed Stanislavski's system of acting to recreate human experience as truthfully as possible. Several of Odets' plays were successfully performed on Broadway, including Awake and Sing! and Waiting for Lefty (both in 1935). When public tastes turned away from politically engaged theatre <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> familial realism of Eugene O'Neill, Odets had difficulty producing successful work, so he moved to Hollywood and spent 20 years writing film scripts.|$|E

5|$|The {{design for}} the Partenope class was {{prepared}} by Engineering Inspector Carlo Vigna, and {{was based on the}} earlier torpedo cruiser , the first modern vessel of the type built by Italy. The development of torpedo cruisers in Italy in the mid-1880s represented a shift away from the emphasis on large capital ships that had been built for the previous decade <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> ideas of the Jeune École, which emphasized small, fast, torpedo-armed vessels that could damage or destroy the much larger battleships {{at a fraction of the}} cost. The Partenope class were followed by the , the last class of torpedo cruisers built by Italy.|$|E
5|$|Hensley {{was arrested}} in Tennessee on moonshine-related charges during the Prohibition era and sentenced to a term in a workhouse, from which he escaped and fled the state. Hensley {{traveled}} to Ohio, where he held revival services, though {{he and his family}} rarely stayed long in one location. He established churches, known as the Church of God with Signs Following, in Tennessee and Kentucky. His services ranged from small meetings held in houses to large gatherings that drew media attention and hundreds of attendees. Although he conducted many services, he made little money, and he was arrested for violating laws against snake handling at least twice. During his ministry, Hensley claimed to have been bitten by many snakes without ill effect, <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> end of his career, he estimated that he had survived more than 400bites. In 1955, while conducting a service in Florida, he was bitten by a snake and became violently ill. He refused to seek medical attention and died the following day. Despite his personal failings, he convinced many residents of rural Appalachia that snake handling was commanded by God, and his followers continued the practice after his death. Although snake handling developed independently in several Pentecostal ministries, Hensley is generally credited with spreading the custom in the Southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Sargent {{recorded}} Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, {{one of his}} specialities, {{which was}} reissued on CD in 1990 and again in 2004. Sargent recorded Walton's Façade Suites in 1961. With the LSO, Sargent recorded Walton's Orb and Sceptre March. He also made a stereo recording of Walton's First Symphony {{in the presence of}} the composer, but Walton privately preferred André Previn's recording, issued in January 1967, the same month as Sargent's. Of Vaughan Williams's shorter pieces, Sargent recorded, with the BBC in 1960, the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis (which he also recorded with the Philharmonia), and with the LSO, Serenade to Music (1957; choral version) <b>and</b> <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> Unknown Region. He also recorded Vaughan Williams's overture The Wasps with the LSO.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so {{they can}} sneak {{him out of the}} house. That night, Elliott and E.T. head through the forest, where they make a {{successful}} call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert, being investigated by a raccoon. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. Their connection disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, they escape as E.T. uses telekinesis to lift them into the air <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> forest, like he had done for Elliott before.|$|E
5|$|The Home Army was {{intended}} to be representative of the Polish nation, its members being recruited from all parties and social classes (the only notable exception being communists sent by the Soviets, and the Soviet-created People's Army). The Home Army's growth was largely based on integrating, into its ranks, scores of smaller resistance organizations. Most other Polish underground armed organizations were incorporated into the Home Army (though they retained varying degrees of autonomy). The largest organization merged into the Home Army was the leftist Bataliony Chłopskie (Peasants' Battalions), about 1943-44. Parts of the Narodowe Siły Zbrojne (National Armed Forces) also came to be subordinated to the Home Army. As a result, individual Home Army units varied substantially in their political outlooks (notably in their attitudes toward ethnic minorities <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Soviets). The largest group that completely refused to join the Home Army was the pro-Soviet, communist People's Army, which at its height in 1944 numbered 30,000 people.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between acculturation <b>and</b> attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> marriage process among Jewish Iranians. Specifically, it was hypothesized that there would be a significant relationship between degree of acculturation <b>and</b> attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> marriage process. The sample consisted of 126 Jewish Iranian men and women residing in the Los Angeles area. The participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 (M = 39). The participants were obtained through nonrandom measures from various cultural organizations, colleges, and social functions. Participants filled out three questionnaires consisting of a demographic questionnaire, a modified version of the Cultural Life Style Inventory (Mendoza, 1989), and the Marriage Process Scale (Banafsheian, 2003). As expected, the results of the study revealed a significant positive relationship between cultural resistance (CR) <b>and</b> attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> marriage process, in that as CR increased, traditional attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> marriage process also increased. A significant negative relationship was found between cultural shift (CS) <b>and</b> attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> marriage process, in that as CS increased, traditional attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> marriage process decreased. No significant relationship was found between cultural incorporation (CI) <b>and</b> attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> marriage process. Thesis (Ph. D.)
