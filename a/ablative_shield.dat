Such a high velocity at relatively low altitudes created skin temperatures up to 6200 °F (3400 °C), requiring an <b>ablative</b> <b>shield</b> to dissipate the heat.

40|$|An {{uncertainty}} {{analysis is}} performed on a recently developed surface ablation model. The primary {{focus is on}} the investigation of uncertainty from the finite-rate chemistry that account for the reactions between the pyrolysis gases (from decomposition of the ablative material) and the char, as the gases flow through the <b>ablative</b> <b>shield.</b> For this aspect, the effect of initial pyrolysis gas composition, its flow rate, as well as the kinetic model utilized is studied. Uncertainties arising out of material properties of the <b>ablative</b> <b>shield</b> as well as the prescribed heat flux at the surface of the heat shield are also investigated in detail here, in regards to how they influence the response of the ablative TPS shield. All studies are carried out on a low-density Nylon-Phenolic resin based <b>ablative</b> <b>shield,</b> due to availability of data (both numerical and experimental) that focuses on the chemistry between pyrolysis gases and the char left behind by the decomposing <b>ablative</b> <b>shield.</b> A detailed discussion on the results obtained, as well as the means to expand the scope of this work for obtaining deeper insight into the influence of each of these parameters or aspects of surface ablation are also presented. 1...|$|E
40|$|System level thermal {{analysis}} of space vehicles carrying ablative shields is usually performed by coupling the Thermal Mathematical Model (TMM) of the re-entry vehicle with the ablative bond line temperature resulting from thermo-ablative simulation. Such simulation is typically conducted by superimposing an ablative back wall condition. During these years, thanks {{also to the}} direct experience gained on ESA programs involving ablative shields like IXV, the need of a more strongly coupled {{thermal analysis}} has become higher in order to optimize both shield and thermal control designs. Being this numerical procedure involving different software, hence requiring the management of a complex iterative approach, the claim for a "one shot run" increased, this to remove time consuming and error prone iterations and improve model management/configuration control. In this frame TAS-I and Politecnico di Torino developed a new tool able to run directly into ESATAN the ablative analysis, allowing a full integration of <b>ablative</b> <b>shield</b> model with the host vehicle TMM.

40|$|Abstract. At this paper, {{the thermal}} {{behavior}} of ablative materials as heat shields for reentry vehicles is investigated numerically. A one-dimensional finite difference solver is developed to simulate governing mass and energy equations. Four ablative materials; AVCO 5026 -HCG, Carbon-Phenolic, Nylon-Phenolic, and Silica-Phenolic; are {{considered as a}} heat shield material for a reentry capsule with the diameter 2. 8 meter. A heat flux profile from a simulated trajectory of a reentry capsule is used for investigation the performance and essential thickness of these four ablative materials. The only restriction for this simulation is the ultimate temperature of the backup structure which is beneath the <b>ablative</b> heat <b>shield.</b> At all simulations, the final thickness is defined by reaching the interface temperature, {{the temperature of the}} border between the <b>ablative</b> heat <b>shield</b> and solid shell, to 80 ± 0. 5 degrees Celsius.
