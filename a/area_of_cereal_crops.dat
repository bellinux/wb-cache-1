It is determined that on the increasing the combine harvester season load from 150 to 350 hectares the rational operational readiness must be raised from 0, 4 to 0. 85, the repair time must be decreased from six hours to half an hour and the {{mean time between failures}} must be raised from six hours to twenty hours. It is possible to ensure these activities by means of repair-servicing correlations, increasing the number of participants in eliminating the consequences of failure and forming the fund of the changeable spare parts, their timely delivery to the mobile units, using the aggregate repair method...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} various beliefs engendered by the crop circle phenomenon of southern England. It concentrates on the various explanations that have been offered for {{the origin of the}} circles. [...] <b>Crop</b> circles are <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>crop</b> that have been flattened into a symmetrical, geometric, usually circular shape that {{do not appear to be}} explicable in terms of current scientific knowledge. The combination of the anomalous nature of the shapes, their objective reality, and the often stunning beauty of the formations has led to an intensive debate, carried on at all levels of interest, into what causes these shapes, and why. [...] The nature of the phenomenon has foregrounded issues in folk belief, that are often obscured in related fields (eg. UFOs, ghost beliefs, fairy lore), pertaining to the methods by which individuals construct systems of belief and explanations from the evidence presented to them. This thesis proposes to utilise this unique opportunity to demonstrate the folkloric nature of explanation. As such it draws on the concepts of traditions of belief and disbelief, paradigmatic revolutions in systems of thought, and the concept of rationally constructed systems of folk belief to demonstrate the methods by which the various explanations for crop circles have been generated, maintained and disseminated...|$|R
40|$|The current {{environmental}} crisis is systemic and involves complex patterns and processes. In addition, given human footprint on world ecosystems {{and the fact}} that human societies mainly rely on ecosystem services, the future of both ecosystems and human societies are intimately interlinked, calling for research questions joining them. The major critical question becomes how human societies and ecosystems will both, interactively, respond to global change. Such question requires dedicated research infrastructure devoted to long-term ecological research and integrated socioeconomic issues i. e. LTSER. In LTSER, scientific approach has to cope with processes affecting by the interaction between society and nature. Such challenge can be achieved by testing hypothesis using replicated design experiments in real world linking both ecosystem functioning and stakeholder issues. We here present five examples of socio-ecological experiments performed in an intensive farming <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>cropping</b> system, i. e. LTSER Zone Atelier ‘Plaine & Val de Sèvre' (France). These examples span from very localized agroecological experiments on pollination and biocontrol in farmers' fields and farming conditions, farm experimental work within agroecological framework on reducing reliance on agrochemicals, small landscape field experiment on filed test of neonicotinoid risk assessment on honeybees, large landscape scale experiment manipulating grassland cover at the whole LTSER site (450 km²), to finally experiment using citizen science with schools and inhabitants of villages. In each of these experiments we provide the ecosystem output and the stakeholder/society consequences of our tests. We finally discuss how genericity and advises for policy makers can emerge from these socio-ecological experiment...|$|R

40|$|Carnivores have a {{key role}} in {{ecosystems}} and their populations are declining at an increasing rate. Habitat loss and degradation through agricultural practices are among the most serious menaces affecting carnivore survival. Agricultural landscapes are dominant in Western Europe and in several places worldwide are changing quickly into more intensive practices. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} how small carnivore occurrence and abundance is affected by these changes in order to find ways to manage agricultural and grazing systems in a sustainable way, allowing both biodiversity and production to co-exist. We present three case studies in Natura 2000 areas, mainly covered by private agricultural land (livestock, <b>cereal</b> <b>crops,</b> oak, pine and eucalyptus plantations) in southern Portugal. In <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> dominant traditional agro–silvo–pastoral systems (montado) small and middle-sized carnivores tend to occur in a mosaic of montado and shrubs. We found that the occurrence of one of the forest species was positively related with the density of trees and shrubs, soil organic matter content, and Shannon’s index of vegetation vertical diversity. The presence of livestock and extension <b>of</b> game-estate <b>areas</b> also seem to influence carnivore occurrence. In <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> extensive <b>cereal</b> <b>crops,</b> the presence <b>of</b> shrubs and age of forest plantations play an important positive role for the carnivore community. Mainly our results suggest that maintaining a sustainable mosaic embracing montado, shrubland and open land areas, may allow higher species richness and abundance by enhancing connectivity between crucial <b>areas.</b> The implementation <b>of</b> this kind of agricultural practices considering the landowners needs is the key issue to achieve the main carnivore conservation goals in Southern Portugal...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{demand for}} {{organically}} produced food is outstripping {{the ability of}} UK farmers to supply it and the majority is imported. Furthermore, {{there is a major}} shortfall in home-produced organic cereals and cereal products, including straw. In response to this need, the consequences <b>of</b> increasing the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> organically produced <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> on pests, diseases and weeds require evaluation. Furthermore, as the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> organic <b>cereals</b> increases, <b>crops</b> may be grown more in the major cereal production regions. This could have consequences for both the organic producer and farmers growing cereals conventionally. Objectives (i) 	review the current state of knowledge on the status and distribution of pests, diseases and weeds in organic and conventionally grown cereals, (ii) 	assess the likely rate of expansion <b>of</b> organic <b>cereal</b> production and the areas where this is most likely to occur, together with any likely or consequent change in the distribution <b>of</b> conventionally grown <b>cereals,</b> (iii) 	assess the distribution <b>of</b> specific <b>cereal</b> cultivars and species in organic and non-organic production in relation to their impact on disease, pest and weed distribution. A specific sub-objective will be to assess the likely impact of the increased use of organically produced seed on seed-borne diseases, (iv) 	try to forecast whether or not the changes in cereal production will affect the current status and distribution of pests, diseases and weeds, and, if so, in which major directions, (v) 	make recommendations for future research, both to ensure that the forecast under paragraph (iii) is correct and that any negative trends are highlighted and, if possible, dealt with. Methods A literature review was undertaken to identify potential risks to conventional and organic production cereals on an extension <b>of</b> the organic <b>area</b> on risks <b>of</b> pests, diseases and weeds. See main report for results. Future work Monitoring of the more important pests and diseases in organic production would be prudent. Any problems for non-organic cereal producers are unlikely to arise for several years because of the small scale and slow increase <b>of</b> organic <b>cereal</b> production, but this should be regarded as a ‘grace’ period to allow for development of appropriate solutions before any potential problems become important in practice. Problems for organic producers may emerge more quickly; these need to be monitored so that cultivar and other recommendations can be developed. It is likely that the best spectrum of cultivars for non-organic and organic production will differ, which would help in restricting disease interactions between the two production systems. Any constraints on production of seed for organic cereal growing should be removed so far as possible. Development of the system of bi-cropping, both for organic and non-organic production, should be continued since there are good indications that this can restrict problems due to slugs, aphids and BYDV, septoria leaf and glume blotch, and probably take all. The importance of using disease resistant cultivars needs to be still further stressed for both organic and non-organic production. The influence of sowing date on disease development, particularly in the autumn, needs more attention. Renewed efforts to develop and introduce production of cultivar mixtures, particularly for organic cereal production, would help to restrict disease development. Fundamental studies on the biology of the major perennial weeds are still needed. Although seed spread can be minimised by frequent cutting, the effects of this on the spread of roots and rhizomes is poorly understood. It is important to maintain a regular watch or survey for indications of any increase in the key seed-borne diseases that may occur in organic cereal production and to determine the reasons for any such increase. Technology transfer The report will be suitable for wider dissemination among researchers and the agriculture industry. All contributing organisations have means by which this information can be made available through press briefings, Web-sites and at farming events. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cereal</b> <b>crops</b> such as maize, wheat, {{and rice}} {{account for a}} {{majority}} of biomass produced globally in agriculture. Continuous economic and population growth especially in developing countries accompanied more intensive production <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> to meet increasing demands for them as main staple foods and livestock feeds. However, imbalance between production and consumption <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>crops,</b> which is inevitably reflected as their higher market prices, is becoming palpable in recent years. Stable production <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> has been threatened by various abiotic and biotic stresses. One of the most threatening constraints is virus diseases. Especially, intensification <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>crop</b> production is often achieved by monoculture of a popular crop variety in a wide area. Such agroecosystems with low biodiversity is usually more conducive to biotic stresses, and may result in the outbreaks of existing and emerging cereal viruses. Numerous reports on incidences of various virus diseases <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> attested that viruses have been a long-standing obstacle eroding yields <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> worldwide. Despite <b>of</b> the evident economic losses incurred by virus disease <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>crops,</b> the progress in basic research on virus species causing major diseases <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>crops</b> lagged behind compared to that carried out for viruses that can infect dicotyledonous plants. This was partially {{due to the lack of}} ideal experimental systems to investigate the interaction between viruses and monocotyledonous crops. For example, inoculation of many viruses to cereal plants still requires tedious manipulation of vector organisms, and reverse genetic systems are not available for many cereal viruses. However, application of latest molecular biology technologies has led to significant advance in cereal virology recently; transient gene expression systems through particle bombardment and agroinfiltration have been exploited to examine the functions <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> virus proteins. Cell culture systems of vector insects enabled to investigate the molecular interactions between cereal viruses and insect vectors. Furthermore, RNAi technologies for vector insects and monocotyledonous plants facilitated identification of specific host and viral factors involved in viral replication and transmission cycles. Also, accumulating information on the genome sequences <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>crop</b> species has been simplifying the roadmap to pinpoint resistance genes against cereal viruses. The objective of this research topic is to provide and share the information which can contribute to advances in cereal virology by covering recent progresses in areas such as: 1) characterization of emerging viruses, 2) analyses of genetic and biological diversities within particular viruses, 3) development of experimental systems applicable to cereal viruses, 4) elucidation of the molecular interactions among viruses, vector organisms, and host plants, 5) identification of traits and genes linked to virus resistance in <b>cereal</b> <b>crops,</b> 6) development <b>of</b> novel genetic approaches for virus resistance, and 7) assessment of epidemiological factors affecting the incidences <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> virus diseases. Synergistic integration of ideas from such areas under this research topic should help to formulate practical alternatives to the current management options for virus diseases in <b>cereal</b> <b>crops...</b>|$|R
