40|$|Small {{modeling}} {{errors in}} the finite element model will eventually induce {{errors in the}} structural flexibility and mass, thus propagating into unpredictable errors in the unsteady aerodynamics and the control law design. One of the primary objectives of the Multi Utility Technology Test-bed, X- 56 <b>A</b> <b>aircraft,</b> is the flight demonstration of active flutter suppression, and therefore in this study, {{the identification of the}} primary and secondary modes for the structural model tuning based on the flutter analysis of the X- 56 <b>A</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The ground vibration test-validated structural dynamic finite element model of the X- 56 <b>A</b> <b>aircraft</b> is created in this study. The structural dynamic finite element model of the X- 56 <b>A</b> <b>aircraft</b> is improved using a model tuning tool. In this study, two different weight configurations of the X- 56 <b>A</b> <b>aircraft</b> have been improved in a single optimization run. Frequency and the cross-orthogonality (mode shape) matrix were the primary focus for improvement, while other properties such as center of gravity location, total weight, and offdiagonal terms of the mass orthogonality matrix were used as constraints. The end result was a more improved and desirable structural dynamic finite element model configuration for the X- 56 <b>A</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Improved frequencies and mode shapes in this study increased average flutter speeds of the X- 56 <b>A</b> <b>aircraft</b> by 7. 6 % compared to the baseline model...|$|R

5|$|In 1974, DARPA {{secretly}} requested {{answers from}} five aircraft manufacturers regarding two considerations. The first {{was about the}} signature thresholds at which <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> is virtually undetectable. The second point was whether these companies {{had the capacity to}} design and manufacture such <b>an</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Fairchild and Grumman declined to participate, while General Dynamics insisted on the use of electronic countermeasures. As a result, General Dynamics left the discussion. The remaining two companies, McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, were each awarded $100,000 for further research.|$|E

5|$|In September 1940, Parsons and Merle Tuve of NDRC {{began work}} on a new concept. Shooting down <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> with an {{anti-aircraft}} gun was a difficult proposition. As a shell had to hit a speeding aircraft at an uncertain altitude, the only hope seemed to be to fill the sky with ammunition. A direct hit was not actually required; <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> might be destroyed or critically damaged by a shell detonating nearby. With this in mind, anti-aircraft gunners used time fuzes to increase the possibility of damage. The question then arose as to whether radar {{could be used to}} create an explosion in the proximity of <b>an</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Tuve's first suggestion was to have <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> drop a radar-controlled bomb on a bomber formation. Parsons saw that while this was technically feasible, it was tactically problematic.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy {{decided to}} build a class of two {{submarine}} tenders which could be converted into light aircraft carriers or fleet oilers. The first ship, Tsurugizaki, was commissioned into service in 1939. Construction of the second, Takasaki, was stopped soon after launch and she was completed as <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier. The ship was commissioned as Zuiho in December 1940.

5|$|Argus had her genesis in the Admiralty's desire {{during the}} First World War for <b>an</b> <b>{{aircraft}}</b> carrier that could fly off wheeled aircraft and land them aboard. Existing carriers could launch wheeled aircraft, {{but had no}} way to recover them as they lacked flight decks. In 1912, the ship builder William Beardmore had proposed to the Admiralty <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier design with a continuous, full-length flight deck, but it was not accepted. As the limitations of existing carriers became more apparent, this design was dusted off and the Admiralty located two large, fast hulls suitable for conversion into <b>an</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier. Construction of the Italian ocean liners Conte Rosso and Giulio Cesare had been suspended by William Beardmore and Company at the outbreak of the war, and both met the Admiralty's criteria. Conte Rosso was purchased on 20 September 1916, possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of Giulio Cesare, and the company began work on converting the ship.|$|E
