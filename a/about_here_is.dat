Still, if I believe that I can set going a better method of treatment--if I believe that I can pursue certain observations and inquiries which may be a lasting benefit to medical practice, I should be a base truckler if I allowed any consideration of personal comfort to hinder me.

60|$|Here is, I say, {{room for}} hope, {{and for the}} {{exercise}} thereof; when we feel ourselves after the worst manner assaulted. 'Wherefore should I fear,' said David, 'in the day of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?' (Psa 49:5). Wherefore? Why now there is all the reason {{in the world to}} fear the day of evil is come upon thee, and the iniquity of thy heels doth compass thee about. The hand of God is upon thee, and thy sins, which are the cause, stand round about thee, to give in evidence against thee; and therefore thou must fear.

6000|$|I {{have spoken}} {{of the vast}} and almost fabulous wealth of this [...] region--it is incredible. The {{intestines}} of our mountains are [...] gorged with precious ore to plethora. I have said that nature [...] has so shaped our mountains as to furnish most excellent [...] facilities for the working of our mines. I have also told you [...] that the country <b>about</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> pregnant with the finest mill [...] sites in the world. But what is the mining history of Humboldt? [...] The Sheba mine {{is in the hands}} of energetic San Francisco [...] capitalists. It would seem that the ore is combined with metals [...] that render it difficult of reduction with our imperfect mountain [...] machinery. The proprietors have combined the capital and labor [...] hinted at in my exordium. They are toiling and probing. Their [...] tunnel has reached the length of one hundred feet. From primal [...] assays alone, coupled with the development of the mine and public [...] confidence in the continuance of effort, the stock had reared [...] itself to eight hundred dollars market value. I do not know that [...] one ton of the ore has been converted into current metal. I do [...] know that there are many lodes in this section that surpass the [...] Sheba in primal assay value. Listen a moment to the calculations [...] of the Sheba operators. They purpose transporting the ore [...] concentrated to Europe. The conveyance from Star City (its [...] locality) to Virginia City will cost seventy dollars per ton; [...] from Virginia to San Francisco, forty dollars per ton; from [...] thence to Liverpool, its destination, ten dollars per ton. Their [...] idea is that its conglomerate metals will reimburse them their [...] cost of original extraction, the price of transportation, and the [...] expense of reduction, and that then a ton of the raw ore will net [...] them twelve hundred dollars. The estimate may be extravagant. [...] Cut it in twain, and the product is enormous, far transcending [...] any previous developments of our racy Territory.|$|E
6000|$|The suddenness of {{the demand}} made for the heir's {{presence}} at Scroope was perhaps not owing to the Earl's illness alone. The Earl, indeed, was ill,--so ill that he thought himself that his end was very near; but his illness had been brought about chiefly by the misery {{to which he had}} been subjected by the last despatch from Castle Quin to the Countess. [...] "I am most unwilling," [...] she said, [...] "to make mischief or to give unnecessary pain to you or to Lord Scroope; but I think it my duty {{to let you know that}} the general opinion <b>about</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that Mr. Neville shall make Miss O'Hara his wife,--if he has not done so already. The most dangerous feature in the whole matter is that it is all managed by the priest of this parish, a most unscrupulous person, who would do anything,--he is so daring. We have known him many many years, and we know to what lengths he would go. The laws have been so altered in favour of the Roman Catholics, and against the Protestants, that a priest can do almost just what he likes. I do not think that he would scruple for an instant to marry them if he thought it likely that his prey would escape from him. My own opinion is that there has been no marriage as yet, though I know that others think that there has been." [...] The expression of this opinion from [...] "others" [...] which had reached Lady Mary's ears consisted of an assurance from her own Protestant lady's maid that that wicked, guzzling old Father Marty would marry the young couple as soon as look at them, and very likely had done so already. [...] "I cannot say," [...] continued Lady Mary, [...] "that I actually know anything against the character of Miss O'Hara. Of the mother we have very strange stories here. They live in a little cottage with one maid-servant, almost upon the cliffs, and nobody knows anything about them except the priest. If he should be seduced into a marriage, nothing could be more unfortunate." [...] Lady Mary probably intended to insinuate that were young Neville prudently to get out of the adventure, simply leaving the girl behind him blasted, ruined, and destroyed, the matter no doubt would be bad; but in that case the great misfortune would have been avoided. She could not quite say this in plain words; but she felt, no doubt, that Lady Scroope would understand her. Then Lady Mary went on to assure her friend that though she and her father and sisters very greatly regretted that Mr. Neville had not again given them the pleasure of seeing him at Castle Quin, no feeling of injury on that score had induced her to write so strongly as she had done. She had been prompted to do so simply by her desire to prevent a most ruinous alliance.|$|E
