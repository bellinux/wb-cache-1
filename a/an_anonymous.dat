40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we present <b>a</b> <b>anonymous</b> network named “NYMBLE”, in this network users can access the network without {{providing}} their I. P address. Their I. P address will be hidden and any user misbehaving {{in the network}} will be blocked when a complaint will be received against the user. The system which we aim to develop in this project is the Nymble System Commanded by Deskstop Application. The aim of this project is to create <b>a</b> <b>anonymous</b> network. In this network the IP-address of the user will be hidden to provide anonymity and also to block access to misbehaving users in anonymous network. Here, we present a system “Nymble ” in which servers can blacklist the misbehaving users, that is blocking users without compromising their anonymity. There are many anonymous network which allow users to access Internet services privately by using a series of routers for example “TOR”. These routers hide the client’s IP address from the server. The success of these networks however, has been limited by the users and employing this anonymity for abusive purposes such as defacing popular and important Web sites. Web site administrators routinely rely on IP-address blocking for disabling access to misbehaving users, but blocking of users is not practical in <b>a</b> <b>anonymous</b> network, because the website administrators cannot find the user in <b>a</b> <b>anonymous</b> network. The website has to block the entire network, which is not practically possible. To address this problem, we present Nymble, {{a system in which}} servers can blacklist a misbehaving user, thereby blocking users without compromising of their anonymity. Our system is providing a solution to different servers a definitions of misbehavior servers can blacklist misbehaving users for whatever reason, and the privacy of blacklisted users is maintained...|$|R

Although Indonesia and the Philippines prohibit the export of juvenile eels less than 150  g in weight from Indonesia and less than 15  cm in length from the Philippines to protect their resources, no regulations are enforced for juvenile fisheries in these countries (<b>Anonymous</b> 2012 <b>a,</b> <b>Anonymous</b> 2012 b). All marked eels are either wild-caught eels or cultured eels that were wild juveniles. No historical stock or juvenile recruitment data for eels are available in these countries; therefore, the fluctuation in the abundance of eels is not well understood.|$|R
