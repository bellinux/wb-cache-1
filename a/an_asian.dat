5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass.

The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In one case, <b>an</b> <b>Asian</b> elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E
