[...] An asset’s criticality is a function of both time and situation based on the asset’s operational or business value. For the DI, value depends on several factors: [...] First, what military operations or services rely on an asset and how those dependencies change across time Next, how sensitive the operation is to the loss or compromise of the asset, in other words what is the maximum allowable down time if the asset is compromised. Finally, what the asset’s <b>assurance</b> <b>profile</b> is, in particular whether asset restoration or a switch to a backup can occur within the allowable down time. Through domain expertise and inspection, critical assets are identified and then reported to the CIP Program.|$|E
40|$|The InCommon Federation {{maintains}} a registry of all Identity Providers that are {{recognized by the}} Federation. An InCommon Federation Identity Provider that wishes to offer identity assertions that meet a specific InCommon identity <b>assurance</b> <b>profile</b> first must undergo an assessment of its identity management system against criteria that InCommon has defined. The InCommon Identity Assurance Assessment Framework describes the rationale for such an assessment and methodology that must be used in performing an assessment. The specific criteria {{to be used in}} the assessment process are not covered in this document; they are expressed in Identity Assurance Profiles as described in Section 2. The initial Identity <b>Assurance</b> <b>Profile</b> document defines two profiles: Bronze, which represents a basic level of assurance and Silver, which adds stricter requirements. These profiles are intended to be at least compatible with the Federal government "Level 1 " and "Level 2 " identity assurance levels as described in NIST Special Publication 800 - 63 [SP 800 - 63]. Other profiles may be developed to meet the needs of other classes of service providers...|$|E
40|$|The {{degree to}} which a Service Provider is willing to accept an Assertion of Identity from an Identity Provider may depend on how the Identity Provider Operator {{registers}} Subjects, issues Credentials, and manages the Identity information associated with Credentials. A set of requirements for these and possibly other aspects of Subject Identity that may be needed by Service Providers becomes an Identity <b>Assurance</b> <b>Profile.</b> Identity Provider Operators that meet the requirements of an Identity <b>Assurance</b> <b>Profile</b> can be certified as such by InCommon after passing a thorough assessment by a qualified independent party. Service Providers may choose to accept only Assertions of Identity that are offered by certified Identity Providers and include a particular Identity Assurance Qualifier. This InCommon Identity Assurance Assessment Framework document describes the Identity assurance trust model that InCommon has adopted including a functional model for Identity Provider Operators and a certification model describing how certification is accomplished. It categorizes different aspects of Identity Credential and Subject information management and the methodology that must be used in performing an assessment of an Identity Provider Operator.

40|$|Project (M. S., Software Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. Operational {{environments for}} today???s {{information}} technology solutions {{are complex and}} varied. The majority are constructed with systems and systems-of-systems, often including cloud computing and the internet. With the increase of web-centric applications, {{it is important to}} understand how systems relate to each other both internally and externally. People???s behavior in an organization is also for consideration in the adoption and operation of assurance solutions. While a great deal of work has been done to identify and catalog software assurance solutions, little information is available about what is needed for an organization to successfully adopt and use them in operational settings. The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Melon, in tandem with the United States Department of Defense (DOD) has developed a framework that models an organization???s software <b>assurance</b> <b>profile.</b> In their paper, A Framework for Modeling the Software Assurance Ecosystem: Insights from the Software Assurance Landscape Project [1], the team from SEI describes their piloting of this framework to prove its value and gain insights in the application of the model in an organizational setting. This report presents the Assurance Modeling Framework methodology and the development of the EaseSAF tool that semi-automates the nine steps of the methodology. EaseSAF is a desktop tool that integrates the specification of assurance modeling requirements using the formal methods based on SEI???s Assurance Modeling Framework. It is an effort to develop an application that allows users to input and manage the enormous amount of data and artifacts necessary to support this framework. Software Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS), USDA:APHIS:Veterinary Services {{conducted}} a national study of beef production, the Beef Cow/Calf Health and Productivity Audit (CHAPA). This {{study was designed to}} provide both participants and the industry with information on cow/calf health, productivity, and management practices. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) collaborated with USDA:APHIS:VS to select a producer sample that was statistically designed to provide inferences about the nation's cow/calf population. Data for Part V: Quality <b>Assurance</b> <b>Profile</b> were collected by federal and state veterinary officers (VMO's) in 18 of the largest cow/calf producing states between January 1 and January 31, 1994. The average weaning weight of calves weaned in 1993 was 504 pounds; the average value was $ 467. 34. For breeding-age females, the average weight was 1024 pounds; the average value was $ 577. 86. For breeding-age bulls, the average weight was 1430 pounds; the average value was $ 1137. 06. Thirty-three percent of breeding-age females were sold due to pregnancy status; twenty-one percent were sold due to age or bad teeth. Forty-five percent of calves weaned between July 1 and December 31 were sold during 1993. Thirty-three percent of calves were kept to graze or feed. Seven percent of calves under 3 weeks old were affected by scours. Seven percent of the 1993 calf crop died or was lost. The largest number of calves were lost to calving problems, followed by weather (32 and 22 percent, respectively). The health conditions that the greatest number of producers agreed had a significant economic impact on cow/calf operations included external and internal parasites (21 and 19 percent of producers, respectively).

For quality <b>assurance,</b> <b>profiles</b> {{of the water}} vapor mixing ratio measured with BERTHA are compared to simultaneous measurements of a radiosonde and an airborne differential absorption lidar (DIAL) on 31 July 2007. The differences from the radiosonde observations {{are found to be}} on average 1. 5 % and 2. 5 % in the residual layer and in the free troposphere, respectively. During the two overflights at 1937 and 2018 UTC, the differences from the DIAL results are − 2. 2 % and − 3. 7 % in the residual layer and 2. 1 % and − 2. 6 % in the free troposphere. After this performance check, short-range forecasts from the German Meteorological Service's (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD) version of the Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO-DE) model are compared to the BERTHA measurements for two case studies. Generally, it is found that water vapor mixing ratios from short-range forecasts are on average 7. 9 % drier than the values measured in the residual layer. In the free troposphere, modeled values are 9. 7 % drier than the measurements...|$|R

The reader is assumed to be familiar with the InCommon Defined Identity Assurance program and Identity Assurance Assessment Framework.

These <b>profiles</b> are intended to be at least compatible with the Federal NIST Special Publication 800 - 63 “Level 2 ” and “Level 1 ” identity assurance levels. The requirements are directly applicable to Identity Providers that use shared secret models for identity credentials but stronger credentials, as defined in NIST 800 - 63, could be used as well. InCommon “Bronze ” qualification requires that an Identity Provider support at least basic userID/password credentials with reasonably hard to guess passwords. Identity assertions may include a unique identifier for each identity Subject that should be usable in access control lists but further identity information may be not well known.

40|$|Background: This thesis {{investigates the}} {{nutrient}} profiling models of ten different transnational companies, presented through the EU Pledge. The profiling models may be developed internally by the companies, {{and are used}} to categorise foods according to their nutritional composition – drawing lines between what is healthy and what is not. On {{the basis of this}} demarcation, the profiling models determine which products are eligible to be advertised to children. Considering the profitability of marketing, the companies have a clear vested interest in setting lenient criteria. How does that affect the research? Objective: Through looking at how information is transmitted and interpreted, thus framed, I aim to investigate whether the ten studied nutrient profiling models are valid, efficient and transparent, or if they are strategically and pragmatically construed on an ad hoc basis. Methods: This is a comparative multiple case study, a qualitative document analysis with an open-ended and exploratory design. Findings: The analysis suggests that the models undoubtedly contain elements of clear strategic framing, and found indications that the science on which they are based is chosen pragmatically to suit specific portfolio brands. Conclusion: If the EU Pledge is to support parents in making the right diet and lifestyle choices for their children, it needs a more standardised, transparent, and uniform approach, ensuring conformity and quality <b>assurance.</b> Keywords: Nutrient <b>profiling</b> models, framing, science, vested expertise...|$|R
