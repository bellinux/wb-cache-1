The results reveal that the vehicle's power train type has the largest impact on energy consumption and emissions. The traction ratio, defined as the fraction of time spent on the <b>accelerator</b> in <b>relation</b> to the driving time, and the amount of regenerative braking {{have a significant effect on}} the individual energy consumption of vehicles.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{performance}} of the FELIX <b>accelerator</b> in <b>relation</b> to the laser performance. Over the past year, a number of improvements have been made to the accelerator, both to the hardware and {{to the way in which}} it was operated, that have resulted in a reduction of the time needed to reach saturation from 9 to 3 mus. Energy spread and stability, both short and long term, and operational flexibility, an important issue for a user facility, are addressed. Surprisingly, &# 039;&# 039;best&# 039;&# 039; FEL performance is not obtained at the same operation point that gives the smallest energy spread, which suggests that the electron bunch length is not fixed. Evidence is presented for the conjecture that the non-isochronicity of the bend plays a major role. Measurements of enhanced spontaneous emission and of coherence between successive optical micropulses, indicating a spatial structure in the electron microbunches on the scale of an optical wavelength, are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Exitation {{of atomic}} levels due to {{interaction}} with electromagnetic waves {{has been the}} subject of numerous works, both experimental and theoretical. This topic became of interest in <b>accelerator</b> physics in <b>relation</b> to high efficiency charge exchange injection into rings for high beam power applications. Taking equations of resonant atom-wave interaction equations as a basis, this paper shows that there exist some interesting phenomena which lead to the existence of trapped electomagnetic waves (photon traps) in a medium that consists of atoms with transition frequencies in proximity to the wave frequency. These traps may exist in random and periodic lattices, and may have very low loss rate. The atomic medium can serve as an excellent wavegiude or tool to form and transmit electromagnetic waves for applications to accelerators and to electromagnetic devices in general, where high pressure gas use is acceptable. In addition, such traps in gases may accumulate substantial energy for a long period of time, leading to the possibility of creating objects similar (or equivalent) to ball lightning.

40|$|International audienceIn {{more than}} four years of {{observation}} the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi satellite has identified pulsed γ-ray emission from more than 80 young or middle-aged pulsars, in most cases providing light curves with high statistics. Fitting the observed profiles with geometrical models can provide estimates of the magnetic obliquity α and of the line of sight angle ζ, yielding estimates of the radiation beaming factor and radiated luminosity. Using different γ-ray emission geometries (Polar Cap, Slot Gap, Outer Gap, One Pole Caustic) and core plus cone geometries for the radio emission, we fit γ-ray light curves for 76 young or middle-aged pulsars and we jointly fit their γ-ray plus radio light curves when possible. We find that a joint radio plus γ-ray fit strategy is important to obtain (α,ζ) estimates that can explain simultaneously detectable radio and γ-ray emission: when the radio emission is available, the inclusion of the radio light curve in the fit leads to important changes in the (α,ζ) solutions. The most pronounced changes are observed for Outer Gap and One Pole Caustic models for which the γ-ray only fit leads to underestimated α or ζ when the solution is found to the left or {{to the right of the}} main α-ζ plane diagonal respectively. The intermediate-to-high altitude magnetosphere models, Slot Gap, Outer Gap, and One pole Caustic, are favoured in explaining the observations. We find no apparent evolution of α on a time scale of 106 years. For all emission geometries our derived γ-ray beaming factors are generally less than one and do not significantly evolve with the spin-down power. A more pronounced beaming factor vs. spin-down power correlation is observed for Slot Gap model and radio-quiet pulsars and for the Outer Gap model and radio-loud pulsars. The beaming factor distributions exhibit a large dispersion that is less pronounced for the Slot Gap case and that decreases from radio-quiet to radio-loud solutions. For all models, the correlation between γ-ray luminosity and spin-down power is consistent with a square root dependence. The γ-ray luminosities obtained by using the beaming factors estimated in the framework of each model do not exceed the spin-down power. This suggests that assuming a beaming factor of one for all objects, as done in other studies, likely overestimates the real values. The data show a relation between the pulsar spectral characteristics and the width of the <b>accelerator</b> gap. The <b>relation</b> obtained in the case of the Slot Gap model is consistent with the theoretical prediction...|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} an {{established}} modality {{in the treatment}} of tumours. With treatments ever evolving and increasing in terms of their complexities, the need arises to ensure the best quality treatment is delivered; the survival of the patient relies upon it. A modern treatment such as Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy employs steep dose gradients varying dynamically to deliver complex dose profiles, whilst the experimental Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) involves the delivery of an array of intense beams tens-of-microns wide separated by several hundred microns. In both cases, conventional dosimetry is inadequate in providing both spatial and temporal information about complex dose profiles. The silicon strip detector was created to fill this void in current dosimetry techniques. Designed to withstand the intense beam of a synchrotron wriggler x-rays whilst not significantly perturbing the beam, the detector provides linear sensitive volume elements two hundred microns in pitch. This enables the ability to perform high spatial resolution dosimetry in real time. This thesis investigates the use of the silicon strip detector as an on-line dosimetry system for MRT with applications to clinical radiotherapy. Of particular interest is the distribution and magnitude of energy deposition within the detector and the perturbative effect the strip detector has on a synchrotron wriggler x-ray beam. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to investigate the properties of radiation incident upon the detector. These seek to understand how a beam traversing the detector interacts with it, as well as the effects the detector has on the transmitted beam and its properties. The energy deposition spectrum within the detector was found to be predominant at low energies of below 100 keV. The deposition of dose through the detector was found to be largely constant with depth through the central axis of a beam, dropping to ~ 10 - 3 of the central value at 50 µm off the central beam axis for an infinitesimally thin pencil beam and ~ 10 - 4 at 100 µm off-axis. Energy deposition laterally through water was determined as dominated by secondary electrons from the beam-edge to 150 µm, and Compton photons thereafter. The depth dose of a MRT pencil beam was found to have an average decrease in dose of (1. 44 ± 0. 15) % (95 % C. I.) when the strip detector was introduced into the beam. The probability of interaction of incident photons with the detector for the MRT spectrum was determined with GEANT 4 and theoretically with a comparison made. The overall interaction probability of an MRT photon is (1. 97 ± 4. 43 × 10 - 4) % (95 % C. I.). A simulation to determine the PVDR (peak-to-valley dose ratio) in a MRT field was created, however only the peak dose could be determined due to an inadequate primary photon count. The peak dose was found to decrease by 1. 41 ± 0. 03 % (95 % C. I.). Qualitative film measurements (deliberate overexposure of peak regions) displayed an increase of valley dose to film at 10 mm in water with the strip detector in the beam, but no such phenomenon at a depth of 1 mm. A simplified GEANT 4 simulation was created to replicate such results with only five beamlets. Peak-to-valley dose ratio calculations from the simulation show no discernible effect at 1 mm depth, but a discernible increase in the PVDR at 10 mm depth; replicating experimental results. Since charge collection across a semiconductor device is often complex and dynamically varies with the bias conditions. Ion beam induced charge collection (IBICC) studies seek to investigate the charge collection properties of the detector in various voltage-biasing conditions. It was found that the application of reverse bias to strips adjacent to that being read out reduced the effective sensitive volume of the read-out strip. This provides evidence for a proposal to incorporate biased guard-ring structures to prevent charge sharing, and improve the confinement of the sensitive volume. Finally, clinical irradiations are performed with a highly collimated orthovoltage x-ray beam down to beam sizes of hundreds of microns. The spatial resolution of the detector in this configuration was found to be 500 µm. The efficacy of the detector in contemporary radiotherapy is also investigated {{through the use of a}} 6 MV linear accelerator’s photon beam. Excellent agreement was found between strip detector read-outs and reference data for the linear <b>accelerator.</b> A quadratic <b>relation</b> was found between dose rate and charge per strip...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with self-induced speed oscillations when driving a car. Although the driver is largely unaware of these variations, speed oscillates around a desired mean speed similarly a sine curve. While speed oscillations are often determined by the traffic situation (e. g. by a decelerating and accelerating vehicle {{in front of the}} driver), the present work focuses on „self-induced“ oscillations of the driver on a free straight road. The self induced speed oscillation is a phenomenon, which was not considered so far in the traffic-psychological research. In traffic flow models, which are a domain of the engineer research, the phenomenon is well-known, but is considered as unsystematical human error. A goal of this work is it to prove in contrast systematic influences on the self induced speed variation. Starting point of this work were salient differences in the speed process during rides of test persons in a driving simulator on nebula condition and on clear sigth: During nebula the test persons showed a more frequent speed variation than during clear sigth. To parameterize these differences a procedure was developed, which describes the speed oscillation {{on the basis of its}} extent („amplitude“) and its temporal duration („period“). The amplitude reflects the extent of the speed difference in km/h from a minimum in the sinusoidal variation of speed to the following maximum or vice versa. The period is the time, which passes between these two points. It was shown that the period varies strongly between the driving conditions (9 - 18 seconds) and becomes clearly smaller in fog (9 - 12 seconds). The amplitude of the speed oscillation remains the same over all conditions and is about 5 km/h. These new values were supplemented into a traffic flow model, which thereupon could point out the emergence of mass accidents during fog on motorways: The more frequent speed variation during fog leads in connection with the reduced foresight to stronger de- and acceleration procedures in vehicle chains, which are more often formed in the fog. The accidents then result from single drivers, who drive too fast in the fog, to be able to stop in their range of vision and then encounter the end of one of those strongly retarding vehicle chain. Here the meaning of the self induced speed variation shows up in connection with other driving parameters. In a further driving simulator investigation also the accelerator variation was examined. This illustrates directly human behavior, while the speed output is along-moderated by physical variables like the mass of the vehicle. It showed up that during nebula and at low speeds more time is spent in the regulation process, based on existing <b>accelerator</b> regulation in <b>relation</b> to phases of non-regulation, than while driving at clear sight or higher speed. In a further driving simulator experiment the reason for the differences in the self induced speed oscillation should be clarified. During a diverson of the attention from the driving task the closed loop of motor action control (consisting of alternating visual and motor control) should be less frequently, which leads to larger periods, since controls and regularization take place now more rarely. In the simulator experiment the attention of the test persons was diverted by sidetasks. Here the expected increase of the period of the speed oscillation showed up with a visual distraction (reaction on targets presented on a display in the center console), but not with a purely mental, acoustically presented distraction (reaction on target words in an audiobook). In a further condition the attention of the test person was directed on the front vehicle driving with constant speed (reaction on brief color change of the front vehicle). This simulates contentwise a ride on nebula condition, where drivers concentrate strengthened on the front vehicle. Here the expected shortening of the period showed up, which proves that the closed loop of motor action control will run faster in these situations. The work could prove that the self induced speed oscillation has systematic portions, which vary with the driving conditions contrary to the earlier findings. Further note for a personstable factor of the speed oscillation was found, interacting with the situation-specific factors. Characteristic values were formed and supplied results, which can be integrated into traffic flow models to the improve the forecast quality. The causes of speed oscillation could be assigned thereby to a theoretical model. The analysis of selfinduced speed oscillation can help to understand driving in common better – especially in the interaction of several vehicles – and offers an addition to the usually reported average values of speed...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{innovative}} concrete applications have been theresult of technological developments as new processing techniques, {{the use of}} concrete admixtures and advanced materials. All these improvements increase the demand for better performing concrete with enhanced workability. However, the lack of reliable engineering tools in traditional concrete production methods has led to some inconsistent control of the workability. Therefore, todays research is increasingly investigating advanced models that capture the flow behavior of fresh concrete as accurately as possible. These models are continuously improving butgenerally keep facing problems which {{are linked to the}} agglomeration ofthe cement particles and to the implementation of combined concrete admixtures. The objective of this work is to investigate the rheological mechanism in cement paste for the combined use of superplasticizer, retarder and accelerator. In particular, an effect on the particle agglomeration is aimed for in order to contribute to a more fundamental understanding of the concretes flow behavior. Concerning the superplasticizer impact on cement paste, thermodynamic modelling and mineralogy studies led {{to the conclusion that the}} superplasticizer can change the hydrate morphology to such an extent that the interparticle contact forces are modified. The extra addition of retarder led to a densified polymer layer at the cement grain surface which contributed to the steric stabilization of the cement paste. An additional electrostatic effect and the induced changes in hydrate morphology are also demonstratedto contribute to the low paste viscosity. With the extra addition of a calcium salt accelerator to the cement paste, an interstitial structure was assumed to diminish the rheological effect of the polymer layer. All the developed conceptual mechanisms were implemented in a coherent agglomeration model, based on measurable parameters. In this model, the internal and external hydrates in a cement agglomerate were defined and quantified. Generally, the cumulative amount of hydrates within the agglomerates influenced the agglomerate stability and the amount of external hydrates determined the reagglomeration rate. For the superplasticizer only, a proportional relation was found between the change in agglomeration rate and the external agglomerate connectivity while, for the extra addition of retarder and <b>accelerator,</b> a reverse <b>relation</b> was found. The latter was attributed to a mechanical contribution of the interstitial volume. On the one hand, the retarder creates a source of slowly hydratingnuclei and particles in that volume and, on the other hand, these particles are expected to coagulate due to the accelerator addition. In the second case, the interstitial volume also delivered a contribution to thestress resistance of the cement paste at rest. This fundamental research combines dedicated analytical methods and conceptual models to improve the understanding of particle agglomeration and contributes to a more extensive insight into the concrete rheology.
