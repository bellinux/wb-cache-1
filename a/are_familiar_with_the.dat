25|$|In 1936, {{deprived}} of morphine for some days, he borrowed a shotgun on {{the pretext of}} killing a snake and {{shot himself in the}} chest. The wound was not fatal, and Marais therefore put the gun barrel in his mouth and pulled the trigger. He did so on the farm Pelindaba, belonging to his friend Gustav Preller. For those who <b>are</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dark moods of certain of Marais' poems, there is a black irony here; in Zulu, Pelindaba means 'the end of the business' – although the more common interpretation is 'Place of great gatherings'.|$|E
25|$|The exemplar-based {{approaches}} claim listeners {{store information}} for both word- and talker-recognition. According to this theory, particular instances of speech sounds {{are stored in}} the memory of a listener. In the process of speech perception, the remembered instances of e.g. a syllable stored in the listener's memory are compared with the incoming stimulus so that the stimulus can be categorized. Similarly, when recognizing a talker, all the memory traces of utterances produced by that talker are activated and the talker's identity is determined. Supporting this theory are several experiments reported by Johnson that suggest that our signal identification is more accurate when we <b>are</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> talker or when we have visual representation of the talker's gender. When the talker is unpredictable or the sex misidentified, the error rate in word-identification is much higher.|$|E

500|$|The story often {{appears to}} assume that readers <b>are</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{geography}} and history of Earthsea, a technique which allowed Le Guin to avoid exposition: a reviewer wrote that this method [...] "gives Le Guin's world the mysterious depths of Tolkien's, but without his tiresome back-stories and versifying". In keeping {{with the notion of}} an epic, the narration switches from looking ahead into Ged's future and looking back into the past of Earthsea. At the same time, Slusser described the mood of the novel as [...] "strange and dreamlike", fluctuating between objective reality and the thoughts in Ged's mind; some of Ged's adversaries are real, while others are phantoms. This narrative technique, which Cadden characterizes as [...] "free indirect discourse" [...] makes the narrator of the book seem sympathetic to the protagonist, and does not distance his thoughts from the reader.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers have praised Super Punch-Out!! for {{its other}} unique {{features}} {{and for its}} rewarding difficulty. Game Informer magazine praised the game for its time attack mode, which recorded and kept track of the fastest knockouts for each opponent. Miller also commended the time attack mode, adding to the game's replay value. Another review from VideoGames & Computer Entertainment magazine lauded the game for a fair difficulty curve, stating that it [...] "is a really tough game, but it's one in which repeated playing (and you will be playing it a lot) really pays off". Lucas Thomas from IGN, while praising the game overall, says that the game lacks the overall appeal that the NES version had and that he recommends the NES version over this version. He notes that the sound is [...] "Not as memorable as the music from the NES game, but [...] more varied". He says that many people who <b>are</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> NES version have to relearn new attack patterns from different opponents. Thomas also notes that the game did not have as large an audience as the NES version enjoyed.|$|E
