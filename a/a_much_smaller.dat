5|$|Facilities {{for wine}} {{tourists}} in Oregon are considered underdeveloped compared to wine regions in California, especially premium growing regions like the Napa Valley AVA.

5|$|In 1954, {{plans for}} a HIAG {{convention}} in Göttingen faced strong opposition from the local Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Jewish Council, the Students' Association and the University hierarchy. Federal government officials intervened, and the event was first postponed and then scaled down to <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> meeting lacking the qualities of a political event.|$|E

5|$|All the New Spain {{flotilla}} arrived safely at Vera Cruz during February and March 1553. The {{plan was}} to scrap eleven of the vessels and keep only five to make the return journey.

5|$|Gold {{was also}} {{discovered}} in Southern California but on <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> scale. The first discovery of gold, at Rancho San Francisco {{in the mountains}} north of present-day Los Angeles, had been in 1842, six years before Marshall's discovery, while California was still part of Mexico. However, these first deposits, and later discoveries in Southern California mountains, attracted little notice and were of limited consequence economically.|$|E
5|$|Hull Creek {{begins in}} a pond in Scott Township. It flows {{south-southwest}} {{for more than a}} mile before turning south. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, the creek turns south-southeast, flowing through a water gap alongside Pennsylvania Route 247 and entering Blakely. After several tenths of a mile, the creek crosses a highway and flows south-southwest in <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> valley. After some distance, it enters Dickson City and reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River.|$|E
5|$|In earlier times, when large {{populations of}} {{springbok}} roamed the Kalahari desert and Karoo, millions of migrating springbok formed herds hundreds of kilometres long {{that could take}} several days to pass a town. These mass treks, known as trekbokken in Afrikaans, took place during long periods of drought. Herds could efficiently retrace their paths to their territories after long migrations. Trekbokken is still observed occasionally in Botswana, though on <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> scale than earlier.|$|E

50|$|The {{civil parish}} of Colbury {{was one of}} the parishes created out of the ancient parish of Eling in 1894.

The modern parish of Ashurst and Colbury was created in 1985, but administers <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>small</b> area than the old Colbury parish.|$|R
5|$|In the 2010 {{elections}} to the Crimean parliament, the Party of Regions received the largest share of votes, whilst the second-placed Communist Party of Ukraine received <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> share.

Former president of Crimea Yuriy Olexandrovich Meshkov called for a referendum on restoring the 1992 Constitution of Crimea in July 2011. As a consequence of this, a local court in Crimea deported Meshkov from Ukraine for five years.|$|E
5|$|The Oregon wine {{industry}} {{focuses on the}} higher-priced segments of the wine market. Oregon growers receive a higher average return per ton and a higher average revenue per case than do growers in other wine-producing regions in the United States.

5|$|The Skopje valley {{belongs to}} the Vardar geotectonic region, the subsoil of which is formed of Neogene and Quaternary deposits.

The layer is topped by <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> layer of clay, sand, silt and gravel, carried by the Vardar river. It is between 1.5 and 5.2 m deep.|$|E

5|$|The black hood helps {{distinguish}} the pied butcherbird from other butcherbirds, the Australian magpie and much smaller magpie-lark, {{the latter of}} which also has <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> beak. It has a higher-pitched call than the grey butcherbird and inhabits more open habitat. The juvenile pied butcherbird resembles the grey butcherbird: it has a buff upper throat and dark brown instead of black plumage.|$|E
5|$|The other Great Powers {{immediately}} {{rejected the}} treaty {{out of fear}} that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the subsequent Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> state comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of Bulgarians outside the new country. This {{played a significant role in}} forming Bulgaria's militaristic approach to foreign affairs during the first half of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Well-known {{and easily}} recognisable, the Australian magpie is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. The pied butcherbird has a similar build and plumage, but has white underparts unlike the former species' black underparts. The magpie-lark is <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> and more delicate bird with complex and very different banded black and white plumage. Currawong species have predominantly dark plumage and heavier bills.|$|E

5|$|According to Boxoffice, The Call was {{expected}} to earn about $11–12 million on its opening weekend in 2,507 theaters across the United States but surpassed this by a significant margin and grossed $17 million in its first three days. This indicated good profits, as the film cost about $13 million to produce and TriStar Pictures paid <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> amount to acquire U.S. distribution rights. With box office takings of over $68 million, The Call is WWE Studios' most commercially successful film to date, the previous top-grossing productions being See No Evil, which stars professional wrestler Kane (Glenn Jacobs) ($19 million) and 12 Rounds, which stars professional wrestler John Cena ($17 million).|$|E
5|$|Aker Stadion {{has been}} {{proposed}} used during the annual Moldejazz, Norway's largest jazz festival, but this has been rejected several times by the festival management. The issue was intensified in 2004, when <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> arena was used for a quickly sold-out Stevie Wonder concert. On 6 October 2007, StatoilHydro arranged a free concert at the stadium with Ane Brun and Röyksopp to celebrate the completion of their near-by processing plant for the gas field Ormen Lange. In a 2012 survey {{carried out by the}} Norwegian Players' Association among away-team captains, Ullevaal was found to be the league's fourth-best stadium, with a score of 4.27 on a scale from one to five.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the missile and the need for extensive testing prior to launch, the V-2's designers at the Peenemünde Army Research Center favoured using heavily defended fixed sites where the missiles could be stored, armed, and fuelled from an on-site LOX production plant before launching. But the German Army and the V-2 project's head, Major-General Walter Dornberger, were concerned that the sites would be vulnerable to aerial attack by the Allies. The Army's preferred option was to use Meillerwagens, mobile firing batteries, which presented <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> target for the Allied air forces.|$|E
