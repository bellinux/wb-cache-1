50|$|Eupodium is a genus of ferns in {{the family}} Marattiaceae native to the Neotropics. Traditionally, many taxonomists have {{included}} Eupodium within the genus Marattia (along with Ptisana). However, Eupodium is distinctive among the Marattiaceae in only having one frond at a time (occasionally two), bearing awns <b>along</b> <b>veins,</b> and having stalked synangia, and one recent molecular phylogenetic study supported the recognition of Eupodium as a lineage distinct from Marattia. The genus currently has three recognized species.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 10 mm. The forewings are fuscous-grey with a suffused white streak along the costa {{from the base}} to near the apex, with suffused whitish lines <b>along</b> the <b>veins</b> running into it. There is an irregular suffused white streak from the base along the fold throughout, and then along the termen to the apex. The dorsal area beneath this is mostly suffused with whitish anteriorly, posteriorly with a defined whitish line <b>along</b> <b>vein</b> 1b. The plical and second discal stigmata are indicated as cloudy round grey spots indenting the lower and upper margins of the plical streak respectively. The hindwings are grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 7 mm. The forewings {{are covered with}} light grey, black-tipped scales concentrated mainly along the costal margin. There is a black spot at two-thirds near the dorsal margin and a small black spot {{at the base of}} the cell and a prolonged black spot at the corner of the cell. There are ochreous scales <b>along</b> <b>veins,</b> mainly in the basal half. The hindwings are grey. Adults are on wing in early June.|$|E
5000|$|Bommeria is a [...] "gymnogrammoid" [...] fern, exhibiting {{unprotected}} sori aligned <b>along</b> <b>veins</b> on the undersides of the fronds. This {{is why it}} {{was assumed}} to be closely allied to Hemionitis. Such a feature is strongly at odds with most pteridoid ferns (Pteridaceae), which typically have linear marginal sori with an indusium, and sometimes protected with a reflexed leaf tissue margin. Apparently, this is a trait that can arise independently, and may be an atavistic trait.|$|E
50|$|The male {{possesses}} scent {{scales on}} the upperside of the forewing that run <b>along</b> <b>veins</b> one to four. The scent produced from these scales attracts females {{and helps to}} distinguish it from other species. Unusually for a butterfly, the female does not lay her eggs on the leaves or stem of the caterpillar's food source (in this case violets), but instead one or two meters above the woodland floor in the crevices of tree bark close to clumps of violets.|$|E

50|$|A TIPS {{procedure}} {{decreases the}} effective vascular {{resistance of the}} liver {{through the creation of}} an alternative pathway for portal venous circulation. By creating a shunt from the portal vein to the hepatic vein, this intervention allows portal blood an alternative avenue for draining into systemic circulation. In bypassing the flow-resistant liver, the net result is a reduced pressure drop across the liver and a decreased portal venous pressure. Decreased portal venous pressure in turn lessens congestive pressures <b>along</b> <b>veins</b> in the intestine so that future bleeding is less likely to occur. The reduced pressure also makes less fluid develop, although this benefit may take weeks or months to occur.|$|E
