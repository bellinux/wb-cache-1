40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to determine anionic surfactants in river water using Teflon (PTFE) <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> preconcentration. PTFE adsorbs hydrophobic and electrically neutral chemical species on its surface. This allows the surface of PTFE <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> to adsorb and concentrate an ion pair formed between a cationic detecting agent and an anionic surfactant in aqueous solution. The detecting agent and the model anionic surfactant used were Co- 5 -Cl-PADAP, a highly sensitive detecting agent, and sodium dodecyl sulfate, respectively. After the ion pair was concentrated at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL/min for 5 min on a 7 cm long <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> (inner diameter: 1. 5 mm), the ion pair was eluted with ethanol at a flow rate of 2. 0 mL/min. The detection limit was 2 ng mL- 1 (3 ×standard deviation of blank). The sensitivity of this method was equal to or {{higher than that of}} the conventional solvent extraction method. This method and the Ethyl Violet method (EV method, JIS) gave somewhat different analytical results for a standard solution containing various anionic surfactants because the sensitivities of the methods are different for each surfactant, while they yielded the same analytical results for river water samples...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the lateral}} size {{reduction}} of stored bits {{on a hard}} disk, the head-to-med ia spacing has to be reduced {{as well as the}} thickness of the protecting carbon overcoats. In order to obtain a thickness in the 2 nm region a new process technology is needed. In the present paper, a high current pulsed arc (HCA) technique is presented as an innovative source for ultra thin carbon coating for industrial disk production. The hardness and scratching resistance of these films are remarkably higher than conventional magnetron sputtered films. With the HCA-Source we are able to produce pinhole-free carbon films with thicknesses down to 1. 7 nm. The thickness profile and uniformity on disk is adjustable by a magnetic field array. The deposition rate is 0. 070. 3 nm per pulse, therefore the coating time is below 2 s per disk. The magnetic layer is left undamaged during the HCA depo sition process. These aspects are very important for industrial disk production efficiency. Strong particle reduction due to a magnetic <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> is confirmed by repeatable glide tests. Particles are confined in the magnetic <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> and do not reach the substrate. In several important tests, we showed that the HC A source is capable of producing carbon layers within a realistic disk production environment with a yield of approximately 93 % which proved to be comparable to current magnetron sputtered overcoats...|$|R

Materials and Methods. We used an anthropomorphic chest phantom with eight artificial GGNs with two different CT attenuations and four different volumes. CT scans were obtained with four models of CT scanner at 120 kVp and 25 mAs with a soft and a sharp reconstruction filter. On the 256 -MDCT scanner, the tube current-exposure time product and tube voltage settings were varied. GGNs were measured with software that automatically segmented the nodules. Absolute percentage error (APE) was calculated for volume, mass, and density. Wilcoxon signed rank, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for analysis. Results. Volume and mass did not differ significantly from the true values. Whe n measurements were expressed as A PE, the error range was 2 - 36 % for volume and 5 - 46 % rom no error.

These studies clearly showed that although water can be extracted from the agglomerate by ceramic elements and evaporated to atmosphere, the rate of extraction is generally too low for commercial application of the technique.

The improvement of the X-ray tube output due to the introduction of new Mo rotating anode and high frequency voltage generator, together with a faster screen-film system, prompted us to investigate the effect of increasing Mo filtration on dose and image quality. In this paper we analyzed the energy spectra distribution for various kV(p) settings with Mo filtration ranging from 0 to 75 μm. The analysis was performed on either an incident or transmitted beam. The entrance dose, the mean dose, the mean glandular dose and the image quality were also evaluated.

In a refinement of the technique, a single channel analyser was used to increase the percentage of counts in the fractional transmittance measurement providing information about the elements of interest. Using this approach, cadmium and indium, elements with a K-edge separation of 1. 23 keV, were separately imaged.
