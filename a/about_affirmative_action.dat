40|$|In this paper, I {{evaluate}} {{the extent to}} which colleges and universities of varying degrees of selectivity engaged in racial, ethnic and socioeconomic <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> for cohorts of students who graduated in 1972, 1982 and 1992.

To understand why postsecondary institutions might prefer students from particular minority groups over otherwise comparable white students, I introduce the concept of compensatory sponsorship (buidling on Turner’s ideal type of sponsored mobility).

40|$|The Treasury Department is {{empowered}} to enforce “established public policy” {{with respect to}} tax-exempt charities. Under this public policy power, the Treasury has revoked the tax-exempt charitable status of organizations that discriminated against blacks, organizations whose members engaged in civil disobedience against war, and organizations involved in illegal activity. The Treasury interprets its public policy power as applying to any activity that violates clear public policy. Thus, presumably, the Treasury could use this power to deny tax-exempt charitable status to an organization that engages in conduct that violates assisted suicide laws, anti-abortion laws, or other sufficiently “established” public policies. The point at which a public policy is sufficiently established for purposes of applying the Treasury 2 ̆ 7 s public policy power is unclear. For example, could the Treasury revoke an organization 2 ̆ 7 s tax exempt charitable status {{on the ground that}} the organization engages in race-based <b>affirmative</b> <b>action?</b> Presently, neither Congress nor the United States Supreme Court has decided conclusively whether race-based <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> violates public policy.

40|$|This Article is a {{critique}} of class-based <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> It begins by observing that many professed politically conservative individuals have championed class-based <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> However, it observes that political conservatism is not typically identified as an ideology that generally approves of improving the poor’s well-being through the means that class-based <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> employs — that is, through redistributing wealth by taking wealth from a wealthy individual and giving it directly to a poor person. This is precisely what class-based <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> does: it takes a seat in an incoming class (a species of wealth) from a wealthy individual and gives it directly to a poor person. This Article attempts to reconcile this apparent contradiction. Interestingly, engaging in this project of reconciliation reveals very little about conservatism, but a lot <b>about</b> class-based <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> This Article proposes that class-based <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> enjoys widespread support from people {{across the political spectrum}} because it is imagined to benefit the “deserving poor. ” Unlike the “undeserving poor,” the “deserving poor” are those who cannot be blamed for their poverty; their impoverishment is not due to individual behavioral or character flaws, but rather to structural or macro forces well outside of an individual’s control. Class-based <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> enjoys bipartisan political popularity because it is imagined to benefit these respectable poor people — folks who are deserving of a “leg up” in the admissions competition and deserving of programs designed to assist them, even if those programs involve a direct transfer of wealth from the wealthy to the poor. However, that political conservatives and liberals alike currently imagine class-based <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> to benefit the deserving poor is a reason for alarm. Alarm bells should ring because, throughout history, the categories of the deserving and undeserving poor have been racialized — and, frequently, racist. To be precise, it has been difficult for people of color — black people, particularly — to access the ranks of the deserving poor. If history is a teacher, then, we might expect that it will be difficult for society to continue to imagine that the beneficiaries of class-based <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> are the deserving poor if these class-conscious programs disproportionately benefit racial minorities. Indeed, if history is a teacher, then class-based <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> will lose its popularity if poor racial minorities — who have always figured within the cultural imaginary as the embodiment of undeservingness — are (or are imagined to be) class-based affirmative action’s primary beneficiaries. The Article explores the case of AFDC/TANF and unemployed single mothers {{as an example of the}} racist nature of deservingness. It argues that, if class-based <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> functions to assist people of color in disproportionate numbers, it, like AFDC/TANF before it, will be reimagined to be a program that assists the undeserving poor, and its political tenability will suffer as a result...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003 The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> as a mechanism for education reform in South Aftica. This investigation was prompted by political changes, which took place after the democratic elections of April 1994, impacting on the provisioning of education in South Africa. The South African education system and its institutions were confronted by many new laws and policies, including <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> programmes that had to be implemented. Structural changes like a unified and racially integrated education system came into being. Through literature and empirical studies it was found that race and gender discrimination was observable in all the education institutions in the RSA. Literature study revealed that neither arguments for, nor arguments against <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> should be overemphasized at the expense of the other. Both approaches supplemented and enriched each other. Applied correctly and managed well, the disadvantages of <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> can be overcome in the main. In this manner most of the injustices of the past can be corrected. It was established through literature study that, like in the USA, <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> in the RSA seems to be an option to eradicate the imbalances of the past in terms of race and gender. In the USA success was achieved by <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> programmes: The American population became more representative in terms of race and gender. On the other hand it was also established that the previously disadvantaged groups were over-represented. This led to the claim of reverse discrimination. The empirical method, namely using questionnaires, was successful in obtaining information about how education participants, especially at school level, were affected by the implementation of <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> policies. It also established how education participants felt and thought about their experiences and perceptions <b>about</b> the <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> mechanism for education reform. The study established that factors aimed at the equality of opportunity (also known as the soft approach) enjoyed preference to factors aimed at the equality of result (also known as the hard approach). In order to bring about the smooth education transformation it also established that for observable and radical changes to occur in the education system, factors aimed at the equality of result (the hard approach) should enjoy more attention than factors aimed at the equality of opportunity. Thus it was concluded that both the soft and the hard approaches were necessary to understand the controversial nature of <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> A number of recommendations were made with regard to the research findings for stakeholders and officials to note.

In all, nearly one hundred Americans talk openly about attitudes that few are willing to admit in public: feelings <b>about</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action,</b> gentrification, secret prejudices, and dashed hopes.

This study was directed toward the perceptions of actively engaged <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> officers in higher education. The <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> officers responded to {{their perceptions of their}} functions, duties, and responsibilities as these variables impacted their role in <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to focus on the actual and ideal functions, duties, and responsibilities of the <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> officer. More specifically, the questions that guided this study were: (1) How does the <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> officer view his/her role? (2) What are the prioritized functions, duties, and responsibilities of the <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> officer as seen from the perspective of the <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> officer? (3) Is there a common core of functions, duties, and responsibilities shared by <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> officers? If so, what are those common characteristics that ensure the probability of success in the role?^ A mail questionnaire was designed. The questionnaire consisted of two sections. Section I gathered information on the <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> officers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of their functions, duties, and responsibilities. This section was divided into seven major areas: Promotion, Personnel, Procedures, Process, Recruitment, Goals and Timetables, and Grievances. The <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> officers rated statements in Column I (Actual [...] current role) and in Column II (Ideal [...] what their role should be) on an eight-point scale. Section II of the questionnaire gathered demographic data from the <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> officers. This section was divided into three major areas: (1) Personal Data, (2) <b>Affirmative</b> <b>Action</b> Data, and (3) Present Position as <b>Affirmative</b> <b>Action</b> Officer. ^ The questionnaire was mailed to both four- and two-year private and public institutions of higher education. Forty-five percent of the surveys were returned by the <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> officers. Among the conclusions drawn from the data received, the following appeared to be evident: (1) <b>Affirmative</b> <b>action</b> officers could achieve a greater maximum in the performance of their functions, duties, and responsibilities if they would be able to spend more time and effort on those items that were addressed in each of the seven major areas (Promotion, Personnel, Procedures, Process, Recruitment, Goals and Timetables, and Grievances) of the questionnaire; (2) more Whites were <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> officers than any other ethnic group; (3) females tend to serve as <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> officers than males; and (4) usually <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> officers were between thirty to thirty-nine years of age. ...|$|R

A survey completed by 387 undergraduate and graduate student participants found greater perception of benefits resulting from <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> policies, defined in terms of increased opportunity (concrete benefit) and increased satisfaction (abstract benefit), related to greater support for <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> Policies presented with justification received more support than did policies presented without justification. Ethnicity did not directly affect support for affirmative action; however, ethnicity did affect perceptions {{of the benefits of}} <b>affirmative</b> <b>action.</b> Perceptions of the benefits of <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> mediated ethnicity effects. Suggestions for increasing support for <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> are provided. <b>Affirmative</b> <b>action</b> policies came to prominence in the United States in the 1960 s. Since that time, these polices have been a constant source of political debate. Psychological research on attitudes toward <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> can be categorize...|$|R
