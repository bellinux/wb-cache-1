5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of acetic acid made {{for use in}} the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate isomerization, conversion of syngas to acetic acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. Acetic acid is often a side product of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis or fermentative lactic acid production. As of 2003–2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European production was approximately 1Mt/a and declining, while Japanese production was 0.7Mt/a. Another 1.5Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Mt/a. Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this increase in production is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.|$|E

In the paper is demonstrated the synthesis of esters of <b>acrylic</b> and metacrylic <b>acids,</b> which have wide applications in the industry for the synthesis of unique polymeric materials, by phase transfer catalysis method. It is necessary to notice that the synthesis of <b>acrylic</b> <b>acids</b> in PTC medium is more important because that compounds are more sensitive at acidic and basic conditions. Here is shown that the offered method has more advantages in comparison with the traditional methods. PTC is characterized by a higher degree of conversion of raw materials into useful products, smaller material and power resources consumption. The offered method for acrylic ester synthesis in comparison with the traditional methods has more advantages: higher process rates, mild reaction conditions, allowing lower energy costs, the complete elimination of hazardous and dangerous organic solvents, all leading to a sharp reduction of air pollution, and volume of generated wastewaters...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} work {{towards the}} development of a new catalytic C-C bond forming reaction. Alkynes and olefins insert into [(IPr) CuH] 2 (IPr = N,N-bis-(2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl) - 1, 3 -imidazol- 2 -ylidene) to give copper vinyl and copper alkyl complexes. These copper complexes insert CO 2 into the Cu-C bond to form copper acrylate and copper carboxylate complexes. <b>Acrylic</b> and carboxylic <b>acids</b> can be isolated by hydrolysis. A catalytic cycle based on (IPr) copper(I) was developed. Alkynes undergo reductive carboxylation to give <b>acrylic</b> <b>acids</b> in moderate yields. Unexpected interactions between several components of the catalytic system led to a number of side reaction, most importantly between [(IPr) CuH] 2 and the product silyl acrylate. The use of silylcarbonate salts to desylilate the product enhanced yield. In addition, silylcarbonates can also serve as a source of CO 2. by Gergely Sirokman. Thesis (Ph. D.)

25|$|A {{thermoplastic}} synthetic wax resin mixture {{developed by}} John W Burke and Steve Colton in 1997 {{can be used}} to compensate losses in objects from translucent materials such as alabaster, marble, calcite, diorite, and anhydrite. The mixture consists of polyvinyl acetate (PVAC) AYAC, ethylene <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> (EAA) copolymers A-C 540, and 580, antioxidants Irganox 1076 or 1035, dry pigments, marble powder, and other additives which were all melted together. This wax resin is a better substitute to wax-resins because wax collects dust and dirt and make the fill noticeable. Polyester resin and epoxies are toxic and noxious. The wax-resin is fast and easy to use, making it a possible new alternative to fill materials in the conservation field. The wax-resin works best on losses that allow for large contact with the original, primed surface and on losses that are thicker than 1/16in. Shallow losses and small gaps are more difficult due to the ease in which the fill is pulled out.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{explore the}} {{possibility}} of increasing compressive strength of hydroxyapatite(HA) bone cement by improving {{the composition of the}} liquids for hardening. Methods: The powder of cement which was composed of α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP) and HA were synthesized from calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate by solid reaction; The liquids for hardening were different proportion of aqueous solutions prepared by adding citrate and/or copolymer solutions of <b>acrylic</b> acid/itaconic <b>acid</b> into citric acid. Results: The cement could be hardened when the liquid for hardening was composed of citric acid solution. However the compressive strength of 24. 96 MPa was only recorded. After adding appropriate citrate into the liquid, compressive strength of cement was improved, reaching a maximum of 35. 60 Mpa.

2500|$|The first <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid</b> {{was created}} in 1843. Methacrylic acid, derived from <b>acrylic</b> <b>acid,</b> was {{formulated}} in 1865. The reaction between methacrylic acid and methanol results in the ester methyl methacrylate. Polymethyl methacrylate was discovered in the early 1930s by British chemists Rowland Hill and John Crawford at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in England. ICI registered the product under the trademark Perspex. About the same time, chemist and industrialist Otto Röhm of Rohm and Haas AG in Germany attempted to produce safety glass by polymerizing methyl methacrylate between two layers of glass. The polymer separated from the glass as a clear plastic sheet, which Röhm gave the trademarked name Plexiglas in 1933. Both Perspex and Plexiglas were commercialized in the late 1930s. In the United States, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (now DuPont Company) subsequently introduced its own product under the trademark Lucite. In 1936 Imperial Chemical Industries (now Lucite International) began the first commercially viable production of acrylic safety glass. During World War II both Allied and Axis forces used acrylic glass for submarine periscopes and aircraft windshields, canopies, and gun turrets. [...] Airplane pilots whose eyes were damaged by flying shards of PMMA fared much better than those injured by standard glass, demonstrating better compatibility between human tissue and PMMA than glass.
