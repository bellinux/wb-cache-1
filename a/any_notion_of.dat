5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} {{among both}} ancient authors and modern scholars about the ethnic {{identity of the}} ancient Macedonians. Ernst Badian notes that nearly all surviving references to antagonisms and differences between Greeks and Macedonians exist in the written speeches of Arrian, who lived {{at the time of}} the Roman Empire, when <b>any</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> an ethnic disparity between Macedonians and other Greeks was incomprehensible. Hatzopoulos argues that there was no real ethnic difference between Macedonians and Greeks, only a political distinction contrived after the creation of the League of Corinth in 337BC (which was led by Macedonia through the league's elected hegemon PhilipII, when he was not a member of the league itself). Other academics who concur that the difference between the Macedonians and Greeks was a political rather than a true ethnic discrepancy include Michael B. Sakellariou, Malcolm Errington, and Craige B. Champion.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{then joined}} the Spartan army in Rhodes, intent on destruction. Zeus, however, {{weakened}} Kratos and tricked him into abandoning his godly powers into the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus {{used to kill}} Kratos. Although he overcame all obstacles, Kratos was stunned at Zeus's betrayal and swore revenge as he died. Kratos fell into the Underworld, but was rescued by the Titan Gaia. Banished to Tartarus with the other surviving Titans after the First Great War, Gaia and her brethren seek the death of Zeus. Kratos, fueled by anger at his betrayal, agreed to aid the Titans and was instructed to find the Sisters of Fate, {{who are capable of}} returning him to the moment of Zeus' treachery. Kratos became determined and utterly ruthless—in the pursuit of his goal he wounded a Titan, killed several Greek heroes without hesitation, and deliberately sacrificed two scholars. All three of the Sisters of Fate were killed when they opposed Kratos, who was prepared to kill Zeus in a final confrontation. Zeus was only saved when Athena intervened and sacrificed herself for him; only then does Kratos show remorse. He learned from a dying Athena that Zeus is, in fact, his father, a fact Zeus kept secret because he wished to avoid a repetition of what he did to his own father, Cronos. Kratos rejected <b>any</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a relationship and vowed to kill Zeus and destroy Olympus. Encouraged by Gaia, Kratos used the power of the Fates to retrieve the Titans before their defeat in the Great War, and with their assistance, stormed Mount Olympus.|$|E

25|$|Three unique {{markers of}} frailty have been proposed: (a) loss of <b>any</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> invincibility, (b) {{loss of ability}} to do things {{essential}} to one's care, and (c) loss of possibility for a subsequent life stage.|$|E
25|$|This {{question}} was, {{in large}} part, {{prompted by the}} Tendai concept of original enlightenment (本覚 hongaku), which states that all human beings are enlightened by nature and that, consequently, <b>any</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> achieving enlightenment through practice is fundamentally flawed.|$|E
25|$|Accompanied by {{her husband}} Albert (Luigi Pistilli), Renata visits the house of Paolo Fassati (Leopoldo Trieste), an {{entomologist}} who lives {{on the grounds of}} Donati's estate. Fassati's wife Anna (Laura Betti) tells them that Donati was responsible for the Countess's death, and says that Simon will probably end up with the property. Renata, who had no idea she had a half-brother, swiftly dispenses with <b>any</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> sibling affection and immediately begins making plans with her husband to murder Simon, who at the same time is orchestrating Renata's demise.|$|E
5000|$|Writing for AllMusic, critic Vincent Jeffries {{wrote of}} the album [...] "This {{collection}} of nostalgia, decent balladry, and quirky anthems probably reinforced <b>any</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> Joe Walsh's creative decline... this reflective, sometimes half-hearted effort belies a weariness that's both sad and difficult to appreciate as this master goes through the motions." ...|$|R
5000|$|The story's {{period was}} moved from 1949-50 to 1970s Hollywood. The Long Goodbye has been {{described}} as [...] "a study of a moral and decent man cast adrift in a selfish, self-obsessed society where lives can be thrown away without a backward glance ... and <b>any</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> friendship and loyalty are meaningless." ...|$|R
2500|$|Also {{among those}} {{critical}} of the Proletkult movement and its vision to create a wholly new proletarian culture was top Soviet party leader Vladimir Lenin.

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, <b>any</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> lesbian {{love in a}} film almost always {{required}} audiences to infer the relationships. The lesbian aesthetic of Queen Christina (1933) with Greta Garbo has been widely noted, even though the film is not about lesbians. Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), {{based on the novel}} by Daphne du Maurier, referred more or less overtly to lesbianism, but the two characters involved were not presented positively: Mrs. Danvers was portrayed as obsessed, neurotic and murderous, while the never-seen Rebecca was described as having been selfish, spiteful and doomed to die. All About Eve (1950) was originally written with the title character as a lesbian but this was very subtle in the final version, with the hint and message apparent to alert viewers.|$|E
25|$|The Confederacy {{controlled}} no ports, harbors or navigable rivers. Railroads {{were captured}} or had ceased operating. Its major food producing regions had been war-ravaged or occupied. Its administration survived in only three pockets of territory holding one-third its population. Its armies were defeated or disbanding. At the February 1865 Hampton Roads Conference with Lincoln, senior Confederate officials rejected his invitation {{to restore the}} Union with compensation for emancipated slaves. The three pockets of unoccupied Confederacy were southern Virginia-North Carolina, central Alabama-Florida, and Texas, the latter two areas less from <b>any</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> resistance than from the disinterest of Federal forces to occupy them. The Davis policy was independence or nothing, while Lee's army was wracked by disease and desertion, barely holding the trenches defending Jefferson Davis' capital.|$|E
25|$|Mackenzie King — and Canada — {{were largely}} ignored by Winston Churchill and the British {{government}} despite Canada's {{major role in}} supplying food, raw materials, munitions and money to the hard-pressed British economy, training airmen for the Commonwealth, guarding the western half of the North Atlantic Ocean against German U-boats, and providing combat troops for the invasions of Italy, France and Germany in 1943–45. The government successfully mobilized the economy for war, with impressive results in industrial and agricultural output. The depression ended, prosperity returned, and Canada's economy expanded significantly. On the political side, Mackenzie King rejected <b>any</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a government of national unity. The Canadian federal election, 1940 was held as normally scheduled, producing another majority for the Liberals.|$|E
50|$|After the {{crowning}} of King Gustav Vasa in 1524, the partisan leader Nils Dacke led a rebellion. Dacke {{took control of}} the area and was supported by the locals, also in Eksjö. After Dacke had been killed by the Royal army, his body parts were hung in public places, to quench <b>any</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> new uprising. Eksjö was one of the towns where body parts of Dacke were publicly displayed.|$|R
6000|$|Amenda, our then [...] "general," [...] was an {{extremely}} stolid young person, and, in some respects, a model servant. She never argued. She never seemed to have <b>any</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> her own whatever.

My avowed reluctance was a function of genuine puzzlement about my ability to add <b>any</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> substance to an already overloaded panel (I objected to the number of panelists, concerned about front-end overload) and to concerns which to these simple-minded ears are far too academic for me to understand...|$|R
25|$|By 27 June, Suvorov {{moved his}} main army west {{to cover the}} sieges of Alessandria and Tortona while Kray was still {{reducing}} Mantua. Suvorov and his Austrian chief of staff Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles planned to evict the weakened and battered French forces from Genoa and the Italian Riviera. However, instructions soon arrived from Vienna squelching <b>any</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> offensive operations. Emperor Francis and his foreign minister Johann Amadeus Francis de Paula, Baron of Thugut insisted that the Italian fortresses must first be captured. In fact the emperor and Thugut were suspicious of Russian designs on Genoa and Tuscany, areas which they considered to be in Austria's sphere of influence. For his part, Suvorov was annoyed with Viennese officials for trying to direct the war from long distance.|$|E
25|$|Another view held by many Protestants is sola fide ("by faith alone"): {{that faith}} alone, apart from any action, is what {{achieves}} salvation, and that good works are merely {{evidence of that}} faith. Justification is generally seen as a discrete event that takes place once for all during one's lifetime, {{not the result of}} a transformation of character. However, most Protestants teach that a transformation of character naturally follows the salvation experience. Instead of distinguishing between mortal and venial sins, Protestants believe that one's faith dictates one's state of salvation and one's place in the afterlife. Those who have been saved by God are destined for heaven, while those have not been saved will be excluded from heaven. Accordingly, they reject <b>any</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a provisional or temporary afterlife state such as purgatory.|$|E

King proved highly successful in mobilizing the economy for war, with impressive results in industrial and agricultural output. The depression ended, prosperity returned, and Canada's economy expanded significantly. On the political side, King rejected <b>any</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a {{government of national unity}}. He held the Canadian federal election, 1940 as normally scheduled, despite the ongoing World War, unlike Britain, which formed a government of national unity and did not hold a wartime election.|$|E

25|$|Scientific {{study of}} {{absolute}} pitch {{appears to have}} commenced in the 19th century, focusing on the phenomenon of musical pitch and methods of measuring it. It {{would have been difficult}} for <b>any</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> absolute pitch to have formed earlier because pitch references were not consistent. For example, the note now known as 'A' varied in different local or national musical traditions between what would now be considered as G sharp and B flat before the standardisation of the late 19th century. While the term absolute pitch, or absolute ear, was in use by the late 19th century by both British and German researchers, its application was not universal; other terms such as musical ear, absolute tone consciousness, or positive pitch were also used to refer to the ability. The skill is not exclusively musical, or limited to human perception; absolute pitch has been demonstrated in animals such as bats, wolves, gerbils, and birds, for whom specific pitches facilitate identification of mates or meals.|$|E
25|$|The major propositions of Badiou's {{philosophy}} all {{find their}} basis in Being and Event, {{in which he}} continues his attempt (which he began in Théorie du sujet) to reconcile a notion of the subject with ontology, and in particular post-structuralist and constructivist ontologies. A frequent criticism of post-structuralist work is that it prohibits, through its fixation on semiotics and language, <b>any</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> a subject. Badiou's work is, by his own admission, an attempt {{to break out of}} contemporary philosophy's fixation upon language, which he sees almost as a straitjacket. This effort leads him, in Being and Event, to combine rigorous mathematical formulae with his readings of poets such as Mallarmé and Hölderlin and religious thinkers such as Pascal. His philosophy draws upon both 'analytical' and 'continental' traditions. In Badiou's own opinion, this combination places him awkwardly relative to his contemporaries, meaning that his work had been only slowly taken up. Being and Event offers an example of this slow uptake, in fact: it was translated into English only in 2005, a full seventeen years after its French publication.|$|E

25|$|Hunter or Tod Gibbie was a {{character}} in Sir Walter Scott's Guy Mannering, based on Gabriel Young who lived in Kilmaurs. Gabriel had a pack of twelve slow-hounds to give tongue, six greyhounds to catch by speed and eight terriers to deliver the coup de grâce. The hunts were always on foot, often of short duration and accompanied by all and sundry. He was paid, just like the mole-catcher, to rid the farms <b>of</b> foxes without <b>any</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> sport. Gibbie {{was the last of}} his kind.|$|R
5000|$|In early September 2015, the MHP and the HDP both {{voted against}} the new interim {{election}} government ministers from taking their oaths of office, causing speculation of whether the MHP was dropping their harsh stance against the HDP. However, Semih Yalçın downplayed <b>any</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> an alliance between the two parties, stating that [...] "a broken clock will still show the correct time once a day, the HDP can sometimes take a correct decision in Parliament. Showing this as a 'MHP-HDP coalition' is a deliberate diversion." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{original}} 1776 constitution {{created the}} position of [...] "vice-president," [...] though no provision was made if the office of president became vacant, which occurred four times.

500|$|Punk {{rock bands}} often emulate the bare musical {{structures}} and arrangements of 1960s garage rock. Typical punk rock instrumentation includes {{one or two}} electric guitars, an electric bass, and a drum kit, along with vocals. Songs tend to be shorter than those of other popular genres. Punk songs were played at fast, [...] "breakneck" [...] tempos, an approach influenced by The Ramones. Most early punk rock songs retained a traditional rock 'n' roll verse-chorus form and 4/4 time signature. However, later bands have often broken from this format. In critic Steven Blush's description, [...] "The Sex Pistols were still rock'n'roll ... like the craziest version of Chuck Berry. Hardcore was {{a radical departure from}} that.

The concept of 'youth' as a cultural group is separate from (but related to) <b>any</b> <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> youth as biological category. Representations of youth, and popular texts aimed at a youth audience, are common within popular culture, as 'youth' {{is perceived to be}} a desirable target market with an excess of disposable income.
