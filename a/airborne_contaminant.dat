25|$|Particulate contaminants, {{including}} pollen, dust, fibers, and soot, may affix {{to objects}} after entering collection areas through poorly maintained ventilation systems. Individuals {{passing through a}} collection area may also have particulates embedded on their clothing or bodies, which can become dislodged thereby becoming an <b>airborne</b> <b>contaminant.</b> Construction or maintenance efforts are another common cause of particulate pollution. Particulates which adhere to collection objects may cause soiling or blemishing, requiring mechanical removal and conservation efforts. These pollutants can be minimized via high quality HVAC systems, regularly replaced filters for vents, and careful placement of objects away from high-risk areas such as designated smoking sections, construction sites, and high-traffic areas such as entryways.|$|E

50|$|The {{process by}} which a photon initiates a {{chemical}} reaction directly is known as photolysis; if this process is aided by a catalyst, it is called photocatalysis. If a photon has more energy than a material's characteristic band gap, it can free an electron upon absorption by the material. The remaining, positively charged hole and the free electron may recombine, generating heat, or they can take part in photoreactions with nearby species. If the photoreactions with these species result in regeneration of the electron-donating material—i.e., if the material acts {{as a catalyst for}} the reactions—then the reactions are deemed photocatalytic. PECO represents a type of photocatalysis whereby semiconductor-based electrochemistry catalyzes an oxidation reaction—for example, the oxidative degradation of an <b>airborne</b> <b>contaminant</b> in air purification systems.|$|E

These exterior sources also contribute to the indoor environment sources such as smoking of plant matter, cooking, oil lamps, candles, quartz/halogen bulbs with settled dust, fireplaces, exhaust emissions from vehicles, and defective furnaces.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to demonstrate an effect of manual feeding on the level of farmer’s exposure to <b>airborne</b> <b>contaminants</b> in the confinement nursery pig house. The levels of all the <b>airborne</b> <b>contaminants</b> besides respirable dust, total airborne fungi and ammonia were significantly higher in the treated nursery pig house with feeding than the control nursery pig house without feeding. Although there is no significant difference in respirable dust and total airborne fungi between the treatment and the control, their concentrations in the treated nursery pig house were also higher than the control nursery pig house. The result that the level of ammonia in the treated nursery pig house is lower than the control nursery pig house would be reasoned by the mechanism of ammonia generation in the pig house and adsorption property of ammonia to dust particles. In conclusion, manual feeding by farmer increased the exposure level of <b>airborne</b> <b>contaminants</b> compared to no feeding activity...|$|R

The toxicity of airborne materials is related to various characteristics of the material, the important ones being dependent on mechanisms and site of toxic reactions.

Regulation of the properties of interest often determines the method of producing the <b>airborne</b> <b>contaminant</b> and should determine the parameters to be measured in characterizing the exposure atmosphere.

There are primarily {{two different types}} of composting systems operating in Korean farms, namely mechanical aerated pile composting (MAPC) and aerated static pile composting (SAPC). In this study, we analyzed various particulate matters (PM 10, PM 7, PM 2. 5, PM 1, and total suspended particles), volatile organic compounds and ammonia, and correlated these <b>airborne</b> <b>contaminants</b> with microclimatic parameters, i. e., temperature and relative humidity. Most of the analyzed airborne particulates (PM 7, PM 2. 5, and PM 1) were detected in high concentration at SAPC facilities compered to MAPC; however these differences were statistically non-significant. Similarly, most of the odorants did not vary significantly between MAPC and SAPC facilities, except for dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and skatole. DMS concentrations were significantly higher in MAPC facilities, whereas skatole concentrations were significantly higher in SAPC facilities. The microclimate variables also did not vary significantly between MAPC and SAPC facilities, and did not correlate significantly with most of the airborne particles and odorous compounds, suggesting that microclimate variables did not influence their emission from compost facilities.

Inhalation of gases, vapors, aerosols, and mixtures of these can cause a wide range of adverse health effects, ranging from simple irritation to systemic diseases. Despite significant achievements in the risk assessment of chemicals, the toxicological database, particularly for industrial chemicals, remains limited. Considering there are approximately 80, 000 chemicals in commerce, and an extremely large number of chemical mixtures, in vivo testing of this large number is unachievable from both economical and practical perspectives. While in vitro methods are capable of rapidly providing toxicity information, regulatory agencies in general are still cautious about the replacement of whole-animal methods with new in vitro techniques.
