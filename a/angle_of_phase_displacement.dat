The topic consist in a new approach for the implementation of power system devices for improving efficiency based on the decomposition of power effects from the Unifying Theory of Electric Power. Characteristics of this theory are an easy explanation of energy phenomena and the systematic method of power expressions. A new method is planned for the implementation of devices wich improve efficiency based on the decomposition of power effects. The expression of elements which connected in parallel with the receiver eliminate the power <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> <b>displacement</b> are obtained and it’s analized how to eliminate the power of asymmetry starting from a passive device grades for dynamic loads. This paper describes the expressions of the elements connected in parallel to the receiver that avoid dephase power, as well as how to avoid asymmetry power with graded filters for dynamic loads.

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} perceptivity usage of the coincidence method for the implementation <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> measuring device. It was necessary to establish the structural elements of the measuring device. The main part. In article main types <b>of</b> digital <b>phase</b> measurers based on nonius measuring are shown. One-time nonius measurer is shown as low accuracy measurer. Multi-time nonius measurer allows to increase accuracy. This type of measurer allows fast measuring by executing in parallel multiply nonius generators, but requiring to work with special schemes to detect errors in case of wrong impulse width's. The coincidence method is known for a long time and now actively used for frequency measurement of signals. Used method is based on several coincidences of incoming and base signals. Drawback of method is dependence of measurement time and expected accuracy. In this paper the scheme for usage for measurement <b>of</b> a <b>phase</b> shift <b>angle</b> with usage <b>of</b> a coincidence method is offered. It is shown that for measurement <b>of</b> a <b>phase</b> shift by this method there is no necessity for frequency measurement of the incoming signal, as it is necessary for other implementations of digital measurement <b>of</b> a <b>phase</b> shift. Conclusions. The result of research shows the block diagram of device for measuring <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> shift <b>angle</b> using the coincidence method. The resulting device can receive the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> shift with any duration of time measurement.

This research is {{a case study of}} Sahra Choueifat, one of Beirut's southern suburbs. It presents a comprehensive analysis of the factors that have affected the displacement and relocation processes in the second <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>displacement.</b> The study focuses on three main issues: (i) the post-war monetary compensation to war-displaced squatters; (ii) the intervention of Shiite political parties in the housing market, and (iii) the conflict over territory in Sahra Choueifat between the incoming Shiite group and the original Druze residents. The study presents three main findings: First, the post-war monetary compensation that the evicted war-displaced squatters received was adequate to allow them to acquire legal housing in Beirut; yet the uncertainty that characterized its implementation led the families to tie-up their capital in vacant apartments before they could move. Second, political parties' intervention in the compensation phase, and in the housing market of Sahra Choueifat, secured better housing quality and tenure rights for the displaced, yet formed religious enclaves within a religiously contentious area. Third, in Sahra Choueifat, groups in opposition are using legal tools, such as zoning, voting, and manipulation of public services to define their space and exclude others. The conflict is causing the displaced families to move yet again in a third <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>displacement,</b> from Sahra Choueifat to more Shiite-dominated suburbs. by Hiba Bou Akar.
