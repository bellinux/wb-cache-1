40|$|The {{present study}} intends to {{investigate}} the issue of asset protection {{in the conduct of}} business activities, especially the internal credit structuring of a subject through the establishment of an endo-subjective segregation of assets, disconnected from the attribution of legal personality, creating a further limitation of liability of the entrepreneur that goes beyond the usual shareholders limited liability. The reason for the growth of the <b>asset</b> <b>segregation</b> technique, both in civil law and common law systems, is linked to the economical need of isolating pools of assets committed to specific purposes and protecting them from claims of creditors other than the functional creditors of the purpose, reducing the establishment and management costs related {{to the creation of a}} new corporate structure and, in a perspective of corporate finance - according to the results of the law and economics studies - the financing cost. As pointed out by Hansmann and Kraakman the assets partitioning, in the two different profiles of Affirmative and Defensive asset partitioning, represents an essential feature of organizational forms provided for the exercise of a business activity. But the phenomenon of asset partitioning is placed in a complex theoretical system, representing a transversal issue that affects not only the area of company law, but also fundamental concepts of private law as the debtor’s personal liability and the concept of legal person. For this reason, the starting point of the this analysis (Chapter One) is the study of the theoretical foundations of common and civil law systems related to essential concepts such as the notion and the different theories about patrimony, the debtor’s personal liability, and the concept of legal person and legal entity (in connection with the so-called autonomia patrimoniale perfetta), highlighting similarities or differences and exploring their development until today. After the analysis of these essential concepts, the study focuses (Chapter Two) on the use of asset partitioning in company law and, in particular, on the birth and the evolution of organizational forms arranged for the conduction of business activities in both systems. From the earliest forms of companies characterized by some form of assets partitioning and legal personality, to the last business forms, characterized by systems of endo-subjective <b>asset</b> <b>segregation.</b> The analysis about each organizational form, with particular attention to forms of companies characterized by the endo-subjective segregation, was conducted in a functional perspective, analyzing the presence or not of the legal personhood, the presence or not of the Affirmative and Defensive asset partitioning profiles, and the level of creditors protection that, in case of a further limitation of liability of the entrepreneur, assumes a crucial importance. The data collected, particularly in relation to three essential legal systems - France and Italy for the civil law area and the United States for the common law area - show that in the last decade, despite the path-dependence of each legal system, the use of the endo-subjective segregation technique has grown in several countries of the Western Legal Tradition area. Once observed differences and similarities between the new corporate structures, it was possible to show how the introduction of these new models of <b>asset</b> <b>segregation</b> produce identical problems in different jurisdictions, as the application of bankruptcy and tax law, generally related to the lack of legal personality. The introduction of similar new company forms discloses the convergence of civil and common law systems, even if based on different theoretical foundations. This convergence is essentially due to several factors such as the globalization of markets and economies, which strengthens the attempt to the unification of commercial and company law towards a new lex mercatoria and encourages states to put in place legislation able to attract foreign investment in a competition and forum shopping perspective, increasing the spontaneous circulation of models. From a theoretical point of view it has been possible to reach several conclusions. On one side, we note that in the context of the asset partitioning theory, the endo-subjective segregation (of series, PCCs and founds committed to a specific purpose) could lead to a peculiar configurations of Affirmative and Defensive asset partitioning: the production of a "Double Defensive asset partitioning" effect (a double shield for assets segregated into the internal cells of a company for both, specialized creditors of the cells or general creditors of the company), or a “Triple Defensive asset partitioning" only for Delaware series with different members; and a stronger Affirmative asset partitioning (considering beyond the general impossibility of personal shareholders’ creditors to reach company's assets, the further segregation of assets within each cell, that are committed only to the claims of specialized cell’s creditors), that could become “Double” for Delaware series with different members (series members’ personal creditors have no claims toward both, series assets and company assets). On the other side, in terms of regulation, it can be noticed at first that it seems essential that the further limitation of liability of a subject, obtained through an endo-subjective segregation of assets, is supported by appropriate forms of disclosure in order to protect creditors, who must be aware of the structure of the company in terms of liability, and by a more penetrating system to protect involuntary creditors, in respect of which seems proper the expansion of liability to all company’s assets. Moreover, for a greater diffusion of these new company structures a regulatory or courts intervention is necessary in both systems, to clarify and complete the current legislation, harmonizing it within the existing system, especially with the bankruptcy legislation, ensuring the efficiency and the compliance with their ratio, their essential nature of <b>asset</b> <b>segregation</b> and attribution of limited liability disjointed from the presence of legal personality, in order to preserve, also in case of dysfunction, the advantages of expanding financing channels and lowering the cost of debt capital as highlighted in the law and economics studies...|$|E
40|$|Like other {{financial}} institutions, private pension funds require {{a panoply of}} prudential and protective regulations to ensure their soundness and safeguard the interests of affiliated workers. These regulations include authorization criteria (such as as minimum capital,"fit and proper,"and business plan requirements), <b>asset</b> <b>segregation</b> and external custody, professional asset management, external audits and actuarial reviews, extensive information disclosure, and effective supervision. These regulations resemble those applied to banks and insurance companies and are not particularly controversial. But private pension funds in developing countries are often subject to structural and operational controls that are more controversial. Such controls include special authorizations and market segmentation,"one account per worker"and"one fund per company"rules, nondiscrimination provisions, regulations on fees and commissions, investment limits, minimum profitability rules, and state guarantees. The author discusses {{the use of such}} regulations in developing countries that have implemented systemic pension reforms. He draws a distinction between this approach and the more relaxed regulatory regime that relies on the"prudent person"rule found in more advanced countries. He argues that the"draconian"regulatory approach can be justified on several grounds, but especially by the compulsory nature of the pension system, the absence of strong and transparent capital markets, and the lack of a long tradition of private pension funds. But the regulations should be progressively relaxed as private pension funds and their affiliated workers gain in experience, sophistication, and maturity.

40|$|Based on {{a sample}} of 467 asset {{managers}} from four countries we robustly find that women manage smaller funds than men, despite tough competition in this industry. Interestingly, the gender gap exists only for managers of smaller funds, i. e. {{at the lower end}} of the hierarchy, as quantile regressions show. This is inconsistent with the glass ceiling hypothesis. Going further, this gender gap is limited to large firms. Explanations may refer to large firms using market power in the area of smaller funds or to "visibility" among top asset managers protecting against unequal treatment of the sexes. <b>segregation,</b> <b>asset</b> managers, gender, attitudes, qualification...|$|R

40|$|Since the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, {{in which}} the Reserve Primary Fund "broke the buck," money market funds (MMFs) {{have been the subject}} of ongoing policy debate. Many commentators view MMFs as a key contributor to the crisis because widespread redemption demands during the days following the Lehman bankruptcy contributed to a freeze in the credit markets. In response, MMFs were deemed a component of the nefarious shadow banking industry and targeted for regulatory reform. The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) misguided 2014 reforms responded by potentially exacerbating MMF fragility while potentially crippling large segments of the MMF industry. Determining the appropriate approach to MMF reform has been difficult. Banks regulators supported requiring MMFs to trade at a floating net asset value (NAV) rather than a stable $ 1 share price. By definition, a floating NAV prevents MMFs from breaking the buck but is unlikely to eliminate the risk of large redemptions in a time of crisis. Other reform proposals have similar shortcomings. More fundamentally, the SEC's reforms may substantially reduce the utility of MMFs for many investors, which could, in turn, affect the availability of short term credit. The shape of MMF reform has been influenced by a turf war among regulators as the SEC has battled with bank regulators both about the need for additional reforms and about the structure and timing of those reforms. Bank regulators have been influential in shaping the terms of the debate by using banking rhetoric to frame the narrative of MMF fragility. This rhetoric masks a critical difference between banks and MMFs' <b>asset</b> <b>segregation.</b> Unlike banks, MMF sponsors have assets and operations that are separate from the assets of the MMF itself. This difference has caused the SEC to mistake sponsor support as a weakness rather than a key stability-enhancing feature. As a result, the SEC mistakenly adopted reforms that burden sponsor support instead of encouraging it. As this article explains, required sponsor support offers a novel and simple regulatory solution to MMF fragility. Accordingly this article proposes that the SEC require MMF sponsors explicitly to guarantee the $ 1 share price. Taking sponsor support out of the shadows embraces rather than ignores the advantage that MMFs offer over banks through asset partitioning. At the same time, sponsor support harnesses market discipline as a constraint against MMF risktaking and moral hazard...|$|E

40|$|Cadmium Manganese Telluride (CdMnTe) {{recently}} {{emerged as}} a promising material for room-temperature X- and gamma-ray detectors. It offers several potential advantages over CdZnTe. Among them is its optimal tunable band gap ranging from 1. 7 - 2. 2 eV, and its relatively low (< 50 %) content of Mn {{compared to that of}} Zn in CdZnTe that assures this favorable band-gap range. Another important <b>asset</b> is the <b>segregation</b> coefficient of Mn in CdTe that is approximately unity compared to 1. 35 for Zn in CdZnTe, so ensuring the homogenous distribution of Mn throughout the ingot; hence, a large-volume stoichiometric yield is attained. However, some materials issues primarily related to the growth process impede the production of large, defect-free single crystals. The high bond-ionicity of CdMnTe entails a higher propensity to crystallize into a hexagonal structure rather than to adopt the expected zinc-blend structure, which is likely to generate twins in the crystals. In addition, bulk defects generate in the as-grown crystals due to the dearth of high-purity Mn, which yields a low-resistivity material. In this presentation, we report on our observations of such material defects in current CdMnTe materials, and our evaluation of its potential as an alternative detector material to the well-known CdZnTe detectors. We characterized the bulk defects of several indium- and vanadium-doped Cd 1 -xMnxTe crystals by using several advanced techniques, viz., micro-scale mapping, white-beam x-ray diffraction/reflection topography, and chemical etching. Thereafter, we fabricated some detectors from selected CdMnTe crystals, characterized their electrical properties, and tested their performance as room-temperature X- and gamma-ray detectors. Our experimental results indicate that CdMnTe materials could well prove to become a viable alternative in the near future...|$|R
