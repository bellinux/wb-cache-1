40|$|Abstract Background This study {{provides}} experimental evidence for biologically induced precipitation of magnesium carbonates, specifically dypingite (Mg 5 (CO 3) 4 (OH) 2 · 5 H 2 O), by cyanobacteria from an alkaline wetland near Atlin, British Columbia. This wetland {{is part of}} a larger hydromagnesite (Mg 5 (CO 3) 4 (OH) 2 · 4 H 2 O) playa. Abiotic and biotic processes for magnesium carbonate precipitation in this environment are compared. Results Field observations show that evaporation of wetland water produces carbonate films of nesquehonite (MgCO 3 · 3 H 2 O) on the water surface and crusts on exposed surfaces. In contrast, benthic microbial mats possessing filamentous cyanobacteria (Lyngbya sp.) contain platy dypingite (Mg 5 (CO 3) 4 (OH) 2 · 5 H 2 O) and aragonite. Bulk carbonates in the benthic mats (δ 13 C avg. = 6. 7 %, δ 18 O avg. = 17. 2 %) were isotopically distinguishable from abiotically formed nesquehonite (δ 13 C avg. = 9. 3 %, δ 18 O avg. = 24. 9 %). Field and laboratory experiments, which emulated natural conditions, were conducted to provide insight into the processes for magnesium carbonate precipitation in this environment. Field microcosm experiments included an <b>abiotic</b> <b>control</b> and two microbial systems, one containing ambient wetland water and one amended with nutrients to simulate eutrophic conditions. The <b>abiotic</b> <b>control</b> developed an extensive crust of nesquehonite on its bottom surface during which [Mg 2 +] decreased by 16. 7 % relative to the starting concentration. In the microbial systems, precipitation occurred within the mats and was not simply due to the capturing of mineral grains settling out of the water column. Magnesium concentrations decreased by 22. 2 % and 38. 7 % in the microbial systems, respectively. Laboratory experiments using natural waters from the Atlin site produced rosettes and flakey globular aggregates of dypingite precipitated in association with filamentous cyanobacteria dominated biofilms cultured from the site, whereas the <b>abiotic</b> <b>control</b> again precipitated nesquehonite. Conclusion Microbial mats in the Atlin wetland create ideal conditions for biologically induced precipitation of dypingite and have presumably played a significant role in the development of this natural Mg-carbonate playa. This biogeochemical process represents an important link between the biosphere and the inorganic carbon pool. </p...|$|E

We tested the role of abiotic and biotic factors that potentially influence spatial gradients of total ion content, acidity, carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorous in topsoil. We studied a network of Mediterranean montane meadows that spans a 2000 -m altitudinal gradient. The analyzed factors were grouped into two spatial scales: a landscape scale (climate and land form) and a field scale (topography, soil texture, soil moisture, and plant community composition). Total ion content and acidity are the major and independent variation trends of soil geochemistry. Soil acidity, carbon, and nitrogen increased along the altitudinal gradient whereas there was no relationship between total ion content and phosphorous and elevation. Climate had no direct influence on the analyzed gradients; all effects of climate were indirect through plant community composition and/or soil moisture. The results point to three types of models that explain the gradients of soil chemical composition: (1) a predominantly biotic control of carbon and nitrogen, (2) a predominantly <b>abiotic</b> <b>control</b> of acidity, and (3) a combined biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>control</b> of total ionic content. No direct or indirect effects explained the gradient of phosphorous. In our study region (central Spain), climate is predicted to turn more arid and soils will lose moisture.

Humic acids are ubiquitous in such environments, yet their impact on arsenic mobility under sulfate-reducing conditions is poorly understood. In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} microbial sulfate reduction and humic acid on arsenic mobilization via a series of advective-flow column experiments. The initial solid-phase in these experiments comprised quartz sand that was coated with As(III) -sorbed goethite (α-FeOOH). The effect of humic acid was assessed by comparing columns that received artificial groundwater in which humic acid was either absent or present at 100 mg L− 1, whilst the effect of microbial sulfate reduction was investigated by comparing columns that were inoculated with the sulfate-reducer Desulfovibrio vulgaris (ATCC strain 7757) versus <b>abiotic</b> <b>control</b> columns. The presence of high concentrations of humic acid alone did not enhance the overall extent of arsenic release from either the abiotic or the inoculated (sulfate reducing) columns. This is consistent with similar arsenic concentrations in porewaters filtered to both 3 ̆c 0. 45 μm and 3 ̆c 3 kDa, demonstrating that aqueous arsenic did not form mobile colloidal humic acid complexes. In contrast, microbial sulfate reduction was found to mobilize substantial levels of arsenic relative to those observed in the corresponding <b>abiotic</b> <b>control</b> columns. Iron and sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) showed that reaction between goethite and microbially-produced sulfide lead to accumulation of mackinawite (FeS) and elemental S. Microbial sulfate reduction also caused important changes in arsenic speciation, especially the formation of aqueous dithioarsenate and monothioarsenate. However, arsenic K-edge XAS showed that arsenic sulfide mineral phases (orpiment and realgar) did not form during the 60 day advective-flow experiment.

At higher initial 1, 2 -DCA concentrations (at and to the right of concentrations denoted by arrows in Figure[*] 1), untransformed 1, 2 -DCA remained at the end of the eight week incubation in amounts increasing with increasing initial 1, 2 -DCA concentration.|$|R
40|$|Bioleaching {{of heavy}} metals from {{abandoned}} Ag-Au mine tailings {{was carried out}} using Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and A. thiooxidans. Songcheon and Myungbong mine tailings were seriously contaminated with As and Dukeum mine tailings have high concentrations of Pb and Zn. After bioleaching experiments, both bacteria led to lower pH and higher redox potential in biotic slurries than in <b>abiotic</b> <b>controls.</b> Bioleaching resulted in high concentration of As extracted from Songcheon and Myungbong mine tailings. In the case of Dukeum tailings, A. thiooxidans increased the extent of Zn extraction. Removal rate by bioleaching was over 70 % in Songcheon and Myungbong tailings; however, A. thiooxidans extracted only 40 % of As from the Myungbong tailings. This study showed that bioleaching is effective to remove heavy metals and As from mine tailings which were highly contaminated with the toxic elements...|$|R
30|$|The {{validity}} {{criteria of}} a respiration rate {{was met by}} all control test flasks (at least 20  mg oxygen per one gram of activated sludge in an hour), with measured values ranging from 33.0 to 39.8  mg O 2 /g/h. The reference substance 3, 5 -DCP caused substantial inhibition of the respiration rate with a mean 3 -h EC 50 value estimated to be 2.6  mg/L. The percent inhibition for 3, 5 -DCP at 3.2, 10, 32 and 100  mg/L were 53.9, 76.1, 90.2 and 93.3, respectively. This was within the expected range of 2 – 25  mg/L, which indicated the sludge was responding accordingly and confirmed {{the viability of the}} sludge microflora [12]. The respiration rates in all the control flasks were within 15  % of each other. Therefore, the mean respiration rate of the control flasks associated with the reference substance and the relevant test concentration flasks was used to calculate the percent inhibition. The respiration rate of the <b>abiotic</b> <b>control</b> was negligible throughout the study.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{report on}} the results of a 40 week study in which the {{biodegradation}} of 16 US EPA polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was followed in microcosms containing soil of high organic carbon content (11 %) in the presence and absence of lead and cadmium co-contaminants. The total spiked PAH concentration was 2166 mg/kg. Mercury amendment was also made to give an <b>abiotic</b> <b>control.</b> A novel kinetic model has been developed to explain the observed biphasic nature of PAH degradation. The model assumes that PAHs are distributed across soil phases of varying degrees of bioaccessibility. The results of the analysis suggest that overall percentage PAH loss is dependent on the respective rates at which the PAHs (a) are biodegraded by soil microorganisms in pore water and bioaccessible soil phases and (b) migrate from bioaccessible to non-bioaccessible soil phases. In addition, migration of PAHs to non-bioaccessible and non-Soxhlet-extractable soil phases associated with the humin pores gives rise to an apparent removal process. The presence of metal co-contaminants shows a concentration dependent inhibition of the biological degradation processes that results in a reduction in overall degradation. Lead appears to have a marginally greater inhibitory effect than cadmium...|$|E
40|$|Variability in {{metabolic}} scaling in animals, {{the relationship}} between metabolic rate (R) and body mass (M), {{has been a source}} of debate and controversy for decades. R is proportional to Mb, the precise value of b much debated, but historically considered equal in all organisms. Recent metabolic theory, however, predicts b to vary among species with ecology and metabolic level, and may also vary within species under different abiotic conditions. Under climate change, most species will experience increased temperatures, and marine organisms will experience the additional stressor of decreased seawater pH ('ocean acidification'). Responses to these environmental changes are modulated by myriad species-specific factors. Body-size is a fundamental biological parameter, but its modulating role is relatively unexplored. Here, we show that changes to metabolic scaling reveal asymmetric responses to stressors across body-size ranges; b is systematically decreased under increasing temperature in three grazing molluscs, indicating smaller individuals were more responsive to warming. Larger individuals were, however, more responsive to reduced seawater pH in low temperatures. These alterations to the allometry of metabolism highlight <b>abiotic</b> <b>control</b> of metabolic scaling, and indicate that responses to climate warming and ocean acidification may be modulated by body-size...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{dissolution}} of chalcopyrite at ambient temperatures is generally slow {{and subject to}} passivation, posing a major challenge for developing bioleaching applications for this recalcitrant mineral. Chloride is known to enhance the chemical leaching of chalcopyrite, but much of this effect has been demonstrated at elevated temperatures. This study was undertaken to test whether 100 - 200 mM Na-chloride enhances the chemical and bacterial leaching of chalcopyrite in shake flasks and stirred tank bioreactor conditions at mesophilic temperatures. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and <b>abiotic</b> <b>controls</b> were employed for the leaching experiments. Addition of Na-chloride to the bioleaching suspension inhibited the formation of secondary phases from chalcopyrite and decreased the Fe(III) precipitation. Neither elemental S nor secondary Cu-sulfides were detected in solid residues by X-ray diffraction. Chalcopyrite leaching was enhanced when the solution contained bacteria, ferrous iron and Na-chloride under low redox potential (< 450 mV) conditions. Scanning electron micrographs and energy-dispersive analysis of X-rays revealed the presence of precipitates that were identified as brushite and jarosites in solid residues. Minor amounts of gypsum {{may also have been}} present. Electrochemical analysis of solid residues was in concurrence of the differential effects between chemical controls, chloride ions, and bacteria. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to characterize interfacial changes on chalcopyrite surface caused by different bioleaching conditions. In <b>abiotic</b> <b>controls,</b> the impedance signal stabilized after 28 days, indicating the lack of changes on mineral surface thereafter, but with more resistive behavior than chalcopyrite itself. For bioleached samples, the signal suggested some capacitive response with time owing to the formation of less conductive precipitates. At Bode-phase angle plots (middle frequency), a new time constant was observed that was associated with the formation of jarosite, possibly also with minor amount or elemental S, although this intermediate could not be verified by XRD. Real impedance vs. frequency plots indicated that the bioleaching continued to modify the chalcopyrite/solution interface even after 42 days. © 2013 The Authors...|$|R
40|$|The {{weathering}} {{of volcanic}} rocks contributes {{significantly to the}} global silicate weathering budget, effecting carbon dioxide drawdown and long-term climate control. The rate of chemical weathering {{is influenced by the}} composition of the rock. Rock-dwelling micro-organisms are known {{to play a role in}} changing the rate of weathering reactions; however, the influence of rock composition on bio-weathering is unknown. Cyanobacteria are known to be a ubiquitous surface taxon in volcanic rocks. In this study, we used a selection of fast and slow growing cyanobacterial species to compare microbial-mediated weathering of bulk crystalline rocks of basaltic and rhyolitic composition, under batch conditions. Cyanobacterial growth caused an increase in the pH of the medium and an acceleration of rock dissolution compared to the <b>abiotic</b> <b>controls.</b> For example, Anabaena cylindrica increased the linear release rate () of Ca, Mg, Si and K from the basalt by more than fivefold (5. 21 – 12. 48) and increased the pH of the medium by 1. 9 units. Although A. cylindrica enhanced rhyolite weathering, the increase in was less than threefold (2. 04 – 2. 97) and the pH increase was only 0. 83 units. The values obtained with A. cylindrica were at least ninefold greater with the basalt than the rhyolite, whereas in the <b>abiotic</b> <b>controls,</b> the difference was less than fivefold. Factors accounting for the slower rate of rhyolite weathering and lower biomass achieved are likely to include the higher content of quartz, which has a low rate of weathering and lower concentrations of bio-essential elements, such as, Ca, Fe and Mg, which are known to be important in controlling cyanobacterial growth. We show that at conditions where weathering is favoured, biota can enhance the difference between low and high Si-rock weathering. Our data show that cyanobacteria can play a significant role in enhancing rock weathering and likely have done since they evolved on the early Earth. ...|$|R
40|$|The Hg-methylating {{ability of}} dissimilatory iron-reducing {{bacteria}} in the genera Geobacter, Desulfuromonas, and Shewanella was examined. All of the Geobacter and Desulfuromonas strains tested methylated mercury while reducing Fe(III), nitrate, or fumarate. In contrast, none of the Shewanella strains produced methylmercury at higher levels than <b>abiotic</b> <b>controls</b> under similar culture conditions. Geobacter and Desulfuromonas {{are closely related to}} known Hg-methylating sulfate-reducing bacteria within the Deltaproteobacteria. Methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in most sediments are controlled by in situ net microbial methylation (1, 13). Environmental mercury methylation is an anaerobic microbial process generally driven by dissimilatory sulfate-reducing bac-teria (DSRB) (1). However, recent research suggests that dis-similatory iron-reducing bacteria (DIRB) {{may play a role in}} environmental methylation (10, 27). Further, Fleming et al. (10) demonstrated Hg methylation by a Geobacter strain iso-lated from Clear Lake, CA. Consequently, we designed an experiment to screen a phylogenetically diverse group of DIR...|$|R
