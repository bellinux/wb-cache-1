5|$|David Brooks {{argued that}} a more {{fundamental}} shift from a materialist to a post-materialist mindset has occurred in recent generations. While for generations born early in the century increased income {{was the same as}} improvements in lifestyle this is no longer true for people born into <b>an</b> <b>affluent,</b> information driven world. Younger generations live much more intellectually diverse lives and cites much user generated content as being mostly produced outside of the monetary economy. He affirms Cowen's acknowledgment that this has brought large increases in human happiness with correspondingly little economic activity.|$|E

5|$|In 1862, Lee and the Shaws {{agreed to}} share a house, No. 1 Hatch Street, in <b>an</b> <b>affluent</b> part of Dublin, and a country cottage on Dalkey Hill, {{overlooking}} Killiney Bay. Shaw, a sensitive boy, found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing, and was happier at the cottage.

5|$|William Shakespeare {{was the son}} of John Shakespeare, an {{alderman}} and {{a successful}} glover originally from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, the daughter of <b>an</b> <b>affluent</b> landowning farmer.

He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1940s {{through the}} 1960s, the Triangle was the {{commercial}} and cultural heart of Jerusalem, with many upscale shops and restaurants operated by German-Jewish immigrant businessmen that appealed to <b>an</b> <b>affluent</b> clientele.

The area was revitalized by the conversion of Ben Yehuda Street and the interior streets of the Triangle to an open-air pedestrian mall in 1982. Over the next two decades, outdoor cafes and souvenir shops moved in, cementing the reputation of the Triangle as a popular shopping and entertainment venue for tourists and young Israelis.|$|E

5|$|Leeds' {{growth in}} the 19th century led to mass {{migration}} to the city; this resulted {{in many areas of}} the city becoming overcrowded and many new houses being built. The industrial revolution led to the increase in both working and middle classes, leading to the building of many new houses, aimed at both classes. The most common form of housing to be built for the working classes was the 'back to back'. Back to back terrace houses were built in the largely working class districts of Harehills, Holbeck, Hunslet, Beeston and Armley, whilst larger through terrace houses were built for the middle classes in Headingley and Kirkstall. Chapeltown developed as <b>an</b> <b>affluent</b> district of Leeds, and boasts many large Victorian villas, however the popularity of outer suburbs such as Roundhay towards the late 20th century brought land values down in Chapeltown and the area fell into decline.|$|E
5|$|Several {{of these}} villas remain today and {{contribute}} to the dozen Grade II listed buildings in the suburb, which has continued to develop into <b>an</b> <b>affluent</b> area with a village feel. The suburb is wholly contained within the Gateshead council ward of the same name and is represented locally by members of the Liberal Democrats party, though nationally the suburb is represented by the Labour party as part of the constituency of Gateshead. The suburb is home to several schools and churches. The principal landmark in the suburb is St Helen's Church, although also located in the settlement is Underhill, the home of Sir Joseph Swan and the first domestic property in the world to be illuminated by electric light. England international cricketer Graham Onions is a current resident of the suburb.|$|E
