5|$|At first, CBS {{refused to}} pay Larson, {{considering}} him a cheater.

Because he had surpassed the CBS winnings cap (at the time) of $25,000, Larson was not allowed to return for the next show.|$|E
5|$|DuMont {{programs}} were by necessity low-budget affairs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> received relatively few awards from the TV industry.

5|$|A {{light rail}} system for Greater Manchester emerged from {{the failure of the}} 1970s Picc-Vic tunnel scheme to obtain central {{government}} funding. A light-rail scheme was proposed in 1982 as the least expensive rail-based transport solution for Manchester city centre and the surrounding Greater Manchester metropolitan area. Government approval was granted in 1988 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> began operating services between Bury Interchange and Victoria on 6 April 1992, becoming the United Kingdom's first modern street-running rail system; the 1885-built Blackpool tramway being the only first-generation tram system in the UK that had survived up to Metrolink's creation.|$|E

5|$|All {{programs}} that wish to provide services-as-files to other programs speak a unified protocol, called 9P. Compared to other systems, this reduces {{the number of}} custom programming interfaces. 9P is a generic, medium-agnostic, byte-oriented protocol that provides for messages delivered between a server and a client. The protocol is {{used to refer to}} and communicate with processes, programs, and data, including both the user interface <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>network.</b> With the release of the 4th edition, it was modified and renamed 9P2000.|$|E
5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN was {{launched}} on March 19, 1979, {{in time for}} the first televised session made available by the House of Representatives, beginning with a speech by then-Tennessee representative Al Gore. Upon its debut, only 3.5 million homes were wired for C-SPAN, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> had just three employees. The second C-SPAN channel, C-SPAN2, followed on June 2, 1986 when the U.S. Senate permitted itself to be televised. C-SPAN3, the most recent expansion channel, began full-time operations on January 22, 2001, and shows other public policy and government-related live events on weekdays along with weekend historical programming. C-SPAN3 is the successor of a digital channel called C-SPAN Extra, which {{was launched}} in the Washington D.C. area in 1997, and televised live and recorded political events from 9:00a.m. to 6:00p.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday.|$|E

5|$|Ethernet {{standards}} require {{electrical isolation}} between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> cable up to 1500VAC or 2250VDC for 60seconds.

5|$|NBC {{ordered a}} full season of Homicide: Life on the Street before a pilot episode was even produced. Planned as a mid-season replacement, the network ordered six episodes for their 1993 winter season, and then ordered another three after {{watching}} the completed pilot episode. The network had been consistently placing third behind their competitor networks ABC and CBS, and was suffering due {{to the loss of}} several successful shows in 1992, including The Cosby Show, The Golden Girls and Matlock, as well as the upcoming end of Cheers in 1993. NBC had tried appealing to audiences in their 20s through several comedies, but those efforts proved unsuccessful <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> decided to focus on high-quality dramas like Homicide. NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield considered it the most promising new series of the season.|$|E
5|$|None of the shake-ups helped Jennings retake {{the nightly}} ratings crown, but World News Tonight still offered stiff {{competition}} at second place. As the millennium approached, Jennings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> started preparing for extensive retrospectives of the 20th century. The anchor teamed with former Life magazine journalist Todd Brewster to pen The Century, a 606-page book on 20th-century America. Designed as a companion book for ABC's upcoming documentary {{series of the}} same name, the book topped The New York Times Best Seller list in December 1998, a month after it debuted. On March 29, 1999, Jennings anchored the first installment of ABC's 12-hour miniseries, The Century; production on the monumental project started in 1990, {{and by the time}} it aired, it had cost the network $25 million. Jennings also anchored a longer, 15-hour version, , on the History Channel in April 1999.|$|E

5|$|Radio {{communications}} provided telemetry {{and scientific}} data links between Mir and the RKA Mission Control Centre (TsUP). Radio links {{were also used}} during rendezvous and docking procedures and for audio and video communication between crew members, flight controllers and family members. As a result, Mir was equipped with several communication systems used for different purposes. The station communicated directly with the ground via the Lira antenna mounted to the core module. The Lira antenna also had the capability to use the Luch data relay satellite system (which fell into disrepair in the 1990s) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> of Soviet tracking ships deployed in various locations around the world (which also became unavailable in the 1990s). UHF radio was used by cosmonauts conducting EVAs. UHF was also employed by other spacecraft that docked to or undocked from the station, such as Soyuz, Progress, and the Space Shuttle, {{in order to receive}} commands from the TsUP and Mir crew members via the TORU system.|$|E

5|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows data packets to be {{used for}} {{synchronous}} voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking {{place at the same time}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.|$|E

5|$|The appeal {{began on}} 29 February 2008 in the Victorian Court of Appeal. Nine Network lawyers {{argued that the}} network {{should be allowed to}} {{broadcast}} the first three episodes of the series, arguing Justice King had erred in her decision to suppress the series because she had viewed the unedited version, rather than the final edited cut that was to be shown to audiences. The network believed the first three episodes, which depicted events {{from the beginning of the}} underworld war in 1995, would have no potential to prejudice any part of the trial. Goussis's murder trial was due to begin on 31 March 2008. The judges overseeing the appeal retired to decide their verdict on 3 March 2008. Their decision on 26 March 2008 upheld Justice King's ruling that the series was not to be broadcast or distributed in or out of Victoria. During the appeal the Nine Network had proposed to screen the first three episodes immediately after any successful appeal, and would give the court seven days written notice of its intention to show any further episodes that it believed would not prejudice the murder trial. The Court of Appeal had dismissed the network's application to appeal, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> was compelled to comply with the suppression order issued by Justice King until the offending trial was complete.|$|E
5|$|The pilot episode, {{which was}} filmed {{over a period}} of 21 days, served as the basis for {{additional}} tweaking of intended story lines. Long creative discussions took place among the writers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>network,</b> leading to the postponement of the filming of the second episode for fourteen months. One major change was the addition of extra material for Brother Justin's side of the story. Brother Justin was originally conceived as a well-established preacher, and as a recurring character rather than a regular one. However, after perusing the preliminary version of the pilot, Knauf and the producers realized that {{there was no room for}} Justin to grow in a television series. Hence, it was decided to make Brother Justin an ordinary Methodist minister in a small town, setting him back in his career by about one or two years. Expanding Brother Justin's role opened new possibilities, and his sister Iris was created as a supporting character. Little was changed on Ben Hawkins' side except for the addition of the cootch (striptease) family; a CarnivÃ le consultant had elated the producers by calling attention to his research about families managing cootch shows in the 1930s.|$|E
