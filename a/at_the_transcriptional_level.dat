The ubiquitin pathways activated among skin cancers are highly diverse and may reflect the various characteristics of the cancer type. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, the most common types of human skin cancer, are instances where the involvement of the deubiquitination enzyme CYLD has been recently highlighted.

C 57 Bl 6 mice {{were randomly assigned to}} different groups: IR (n= 22); postconditioning (PostC, n= 21) : a protocol of 3 cycles of 1 -minute reperfusion and 1 -minute reocclusion was applied <b>at</b> <b>the</b> onset of reperfusion; preconditioning (PreC, n= 15; same algorithm but applied before ischemia. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of surgery, left ventricles were assigned to RNA extraction or infarct size assessment. Homemade mouse oligo microarrays were used for gene expression profiling (Montpellier GenomiX Facilities). Determination of area at risk (AR) and infarct size was assessed by TTC staining and planimetry. ResultsOur study revealed that despite a similar cardioprotection offered by PreC and PostC on infarct size, PostC regulates a larger number of genes compared to PreC (242 versus 40). Only 8 genes were jointly regulated by PreC and PostC and considered as putative cardioprotective key regulators. Among these candidates, Zac 1 was down regulated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcriptional</b> <b>levels</b> upon PreC and PostC.

ConclusionUsing pangenomic microarrays, we identified and compared the gene profiles of preconditioning and postconditioning versus IR in the mouse left ventricle in vivo. Among the genes jointly downregulated by preconditioning and postconditioning, Zac 1 was identified as a putative cardioprotective key regulator.

Elevated plasma free fatty acid is one of the characteristics of obesity and has been linked to podocyte dysfunction. However, the mechanisms remain unclear. In the current study, we examined the effect of saturated free fatty acid (FFA) on human podocyte apoptosis and function in vitro. The mechanism and its in vivo relevance were also determined. We found that FFA treatment induced human podocyte apoptosis and dysfunction, which was associated with increased expression of a matricellular protein-thrombospondin 1 (TSP 1). FFA stimulated TSP 1 expression in podocytes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcriptional</b> <b>levels</b> through activation of MAPK pathway. Addition of purified TSP 1 to cell culture media induced podocyte apoptosis and dysfunction. Tis effect is though a TGF-β independent mechanism. Moreover, peptide treatment to block TSP 1 binding to its receptor-CD 36 attenuated FFA induced podocyte apoptosis, suggesting that TSP 1 /CD 36 interaction mediates FFA-induced podocyte apoptosis. Importantly, using a diet-induced obese mouse model, in vivo data demonstrated that obesity-associated podocyte apoptosis and dysfunction were attenuated in TSP 1 deficient mice as well as in CD 36 deficient mice. Taken together, these studies provide novel evidence that the interaction of TSP 1 with its receptor CD 36 contributes to obesity — associated podocytopathy...|$|R
