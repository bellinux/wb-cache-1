The beast mutters that [...] "death would be a gift" [...] for the Doctor before it passes away. The Doctor finds his TARDIS nearby, Gibbis asks for a lift home and the Doctor then takes Amy and Rory to London, believing it best for the two to stop travelling with him before they end up getting killed. Giving them a new house and car, the Doctor sets off alone in the TARDIS.|$|E
500|$|... (Nine hundred {{was roughly}} {{the number of}} men in a single {{infantry}} battalion, and as regiments were formed on local lines, most would have been from the same county; it is thus emphasised that his crime is a black mark against both the regiment, as a whole, and against his comrades.)

After a brief frolic with prostitutes and a period of reflection, Pike and the gang try to forcibly persuade Mapache to release Angel, who by then was barely alive after the torture.

500|$|The Brute Man was {{featured}} in a seventh season episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, a comedy television series. In the show, the human character Mike Nelson and his two robots friends, Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo, are trapped in a satellite and forced by the mad scientist Dr. Forrester to watch bad films {{as part of an}} ongoing scientific experiment. In order to get through the experiment, Mike and the robots make jokes mocking the film <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>watch.</b> During the episode, their silhouetted images are superimposed over the film {{to give the impression that}} they are sitting in a movie theater as they make their jokes. The Brute Man was the second episode of the seventh season, which was broadcast on Comedy Central on February 10, 1996. The description for The Brute Man in The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide, a book by the cast and writers of the series, reads: [...] "A dark film about dark things. Rondo Hatton's swan song; he died just weeks after the film was completed. So murky and dark, it makes M look like Mrs. Doubtfire." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Girl" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and released in mid-February along with the video for [...] "Cater 2 U". It was inspired by Sex and the City, containing elements and influences of the sitcom in many scenes. The clip is split into two different sets: Destiny's Child in Beyoncé's apartment and the same trio on a fictional television show. It begins with Michelle and Kelly entering Beyoncé's apartment as she writes on her laptop. They settle down with snacks and wine <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> a fictional show styled after Sex and the City. After the opening credits, Beyoncé and Michelle meet Kelly on the TV for lunch at a restaurant. Throughout the video, the women at home respond {{to the events of}} the program through gestures and actions, while, on the television, the dialogue of the song matches their conversations in the restaurant. Beyoncé confronts Kelly about her sad demeanor and suspected boyfriend problems, but she feigns shock and insists that nothing is wrong; however, neither Michelle nor Beyoncé are convinced. Viewers can see that, on one occasion, her boyfriend took very long to come home without explanation and, when he finally arrived, a hurt Kelly threw his food away before running upstairs avoiding him.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews were decidedly more mixed to negative. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. The two wrote that [...] "Mulder catches up with the store and {{immediately}} this all becomes a little more formulaic." [...] The two praised the episode's teaser, referring to it as [...] "deathless prose", but were more critical of the plot, arguing that the episode [...] "feels too soon to see yet more sequences of people standing around emoting <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> the dying in the hospital", {{a reference to the}} show's earlier arc involving Scully's cancer. Shearman and Pearson, however, did compliment the performance of both Diewold and Anderson, and called the finale scene [...] "wonderful". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique, on the other hand, gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She heavily criticized the episode's characterization, noting that the episode's opening sequence was [...] "ludicrous" [...] and its revelations were [...] "out of the blue". Vitaris reasoned that, because Scully had spent time with her mother, remembered fondly her sister, and reconnected her faith in God in [...] "Redux II", [...] "this development just doesn't track." [...] Vitaris also criticized Mulder's antics, calling him a [...] "thug" [...] for beating up [...] "an unarmed man and kicking him while he's down." ...|$|E

He is shocked by the scale of the urban collapse that has struck the city – law and order has broken down and marauding gangs terrorise the litter-strewn, decaying streets. Appearing as a guest on a television programme covering the [...] "Hands in Space" [...] project, a joint space mission between the United States and Russia, Quatermass is horrified when the two spacecraft are destroyed by some unknown force. Astronomer Joe Kapp (Simon MacCorkindale), another guest on the programme, invites Quatermass to join him at his home in the country where he has constructed a radio telescope. At the radio telescope, Kapp's colleagues report that they detected a powerful signal at the exact time of the incident in space. Quatermass is intrigued by the behaviour of a group of hippie-like youngsters known as the Planet People, who are travelling to various neolithic sites from where they believe they will be transported to a better life on another planet. Quatermass suspects Hettie has joined them. Along with Kapp's wife, Claire (Barbara Kellerman), Quatermass and Kapp follow a group of Planet People to a stone circle of megaliths, Ringstone Round. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>watch,</b> the Planet People assembled inside the circle are bathed in a bright light and disappear, leaving only a residue of white dust.|$|E
