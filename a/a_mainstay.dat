5|$|Drizzt Do'Urden's {{stories are}} set in the Forgotten Realms {{campaign}} setting for Dungeons & Dragons. The character has been <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> for author R. A. Salvatore, appearing in his novels for over 20 years. Drizzt is a drow who acts against the drow stereotype, favoring friendship and peace over hatred and violence. His unusual personality creates the conflict that allows Salvatore to create so many novels with stories about courage and friendship. Drizzt fights the dark traits that are inherent in the drow.|$|E

5|$|The tourism {{industry}} is also <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> for communities on the lagoon. Beach-goers must pass the Laguna Madre {{to reach the}} prime beaching destination at both North and South Padre Islands. Fishing has drawn tourists to Port Isabel, where the Texas International Fishing Tournament has been held since 1934. Visitors also flock to Bird Island off the western coast of Padre Island, for windsurfing, kayaking, and other water sports.|$|E
5|$|After {{a decline}} in the 1890s, the logging of native timber {{expanded}} into new areas made accessible by an extension of the railway, before petering out in the mid-20th century. One nail in the industry's coffin came with a series of bushfires which destroyed several mills in 1935. The cleared land was used primarily for pastoral sheep and dairy farming, which continues to be <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> of the Catlins' economy. Much of the remaining forest is now protected by the Department of Conservation as part of the Catlins Conservation Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{following}} {{the launch of}} the wide-body 747, Boeing began considering further developments of its narrow-body 727 trijet. Designed for short and medium length routes, the three-engined 727 was the best-selling commercial jetliner of the 1960s and <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> of the U.S. domestic airline market. Studies focused on improving the 189-seat , the most successful 727 variant. Two approaches were considered: a stretched , and an all-new aircraft code-named 7N7. The former was a cheaper derivative using the 727's existing technology and tail-mounted engine configuration, while the latter was a twin-engine aircraft which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil aerospace industry.|$|E

5|$|Logging {{remained}} <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> {{of industry}} in Missoula with the groundbreaking of the Hoerner-Waldorf pulp mill in 1956, {{which resulted in}} protests over the resultant air pollution. An article in Life magazine thirteen years later speaks of Missoulians sometimes needing to drive with headlights on during the day to navigate through the smog. In 1979, still almost 40% of the county's labor income came from the wood and paper products sector. The lumber industry was hit hard by the recession of the early 1980s, and Missoula's economy began to diversify. By the early 1990s, the disappearance {{of many of the}} region's log yards, along with legislation, had helped clean the skies dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Only two of {{the seven}} {{surviving}} plays can be dated securely: Philoctetes (409 BC) and Oedipus at Colonus (401 BC, staged after Sophocles' death by his grandson). Of the others, Electra shows stylistic similarities to these two plays, which suggests that it was probably written {{in the latter part}} of his career. Ajax, Antigone and The Trachiniae are generally thought to be among his early works, again based on stylistic elements, with Oedipus Rex coming in Sophocles' middle period. Most of Sophocles' plays show an undercurrent of early fatalism and the beginnings of Socratic logic as <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> for the long tradition of Greek tragedy.|$|E
5|$|RKO {{has long}} been celebrated for its series of musicals {{starring}} Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in the mid-to-late 1930s. Actors Katharine Hepburn and, later, Robert Mitchum had their first major successes at the studio. Cary Grant was <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> for years. The work of producer Val Lewton's low-budget horror unit and RKO's many ventures into the field now known as film noir have been acclaimed, largely after the fact, by film critics and historians. The studio produced {{two of the most}} famous films in motion picture history: King Kong and Citizen Kane. RKO was also known for being the distributor to a significant portion of Walt Disney's animated feature films, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 to Peter Pan in 1953.|$|E

5|$|Storytelling was <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> of the Igbo {{tradition}} and {{an integral part}} of the community. Achebe's mother and sister Zinobia Uzoma told him many stories as a child, which he repeatedly requested. His education was furthered by the collages his father hung on the walls of their home, as well as almanacs and numerous books– including a prose adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream (c. 1590) and an Igbo version of The Pilgrim's Progress (1678). Chinua also eagerly anticipated traditional village events, like the frequent masquerade ceremonies, which he recreated later in his novels and stories.|$|E
5|$|The National Museum of African Art is the Smithsonian Institution's African art museum, {{located on}} the National Mall of the United States capital. Its {{collections}} include 9,000 works of traditional and contemporary African art from both Sub-Saharan and Arab North Africa, 300,000 photographs, and 50,000 library volumes. It was the first institution dedicated to African art in the United States, and remains the largest collection. The Washington Post called the museum <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> in the international art world and the main venue for contemporary African art in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, {{following the}} appointment of Quique Sánchez Flores as new club manager, Domínguez became <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> in the Atlético Madrid side at left-back where he displaced captain Antonio López from the starting XI. López later returned to the starting line-up when Sánchez Flores opted to convert Domínguez to the centre-back position. It was also the season in which Domínguez signed his first professional contract with los Colchoneros, penning a four-year deal until June 2013. He ultimately made 46 appearances for the season across all competitions and {{was part of the}} squads which ended as runners-up in the Copa del Rey and as champions in the UEFA Europa League, where he started in a 2–1 win over Fulham.|$|E

5|$|The {{number and}} value of {{contracts}} coming to the station significantly increased during World War II; the 1943–1944 budget {{was the first in}} which industry and government contracts exceeded the station's other income, most notably, its state appropriation. Director Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty for fewer incoming contracts as the Georgia General Assembly had cut the station's appropriation by 40%, but increased support from industry and government eventually compensated for lower state funding. World War II is credited with GTRI's entry into electronics, especially telecommunications and electronic warfare; the electronics and communications work that Director Rosselot attracted is still <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> of GTRI research. Two of the larger projects were a study on the propagation of electromagnetic waves, and United States Navy–sponsored radar research.|$|E
5|$|This Week is {{a current}} affairs {{television}} series {{which began in}} 1956. In 1978, it was renamed TV Eye and took on a slightly lighter format; the title This Week was restored in 1986, after which it became steadily more journalistic. The programme was broadcast simultaneously across the ITV regions and became <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> of ITV's current affairs programming. By 1988, the programme had interviewed several prime ministers and leaders of the opposition, including Margaret Thatcher (the incumbent prime minister), who had been interviewed for three full episodes.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{resulted}} in a dramatic increase of sponsored research, with the 1943–1944 budget being the first in which industry and government contracts exceeded the EES's other income (most notably, its state appropriation). Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty for fewer incoming contracts as the state had cut the station's appropriation by 40 percent, but increased support from industry and government eventually counteracted low state support. The electronics and communications research that Directors Gerald Rosselot and James E. Boyd attracted is still <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> of GTRI research. Two of the larger projects were {{a study on the}} propagation of electromagnetic waves, and United States Navy-sponsored radar research.|$|E

5|$|After {{the breakup}} of the Spirit Squad, he was repacked as Kenny Dykstra - an homage to {{baseball}} player Lenny Dykstra - with a new attire and a new theme music. He became interested in joining the group Rated-RKO, which consisted of Edge and Randy Orton. In order to join, he was told to prove himself first. He continued the feud with Ric Flair, managing to pick up three straight victories over Flair one being at New Year's Revolution (2007) before finally losing to him on the January 15, 2007 episode of Raw. Dykstra competed in the 2007 Royal Rumble match and got eliminated by Edge. After his feud with Flair, Dykstra become <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> on Raws sister show Heat, having feuds with both Eugene and Val Venis.|$|E
5|$|Asche {{began the}} 2015 season among the team's hottest hitters, and <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> {{in the lineup}} as the team's {{starting}} third baseman. However, in late April, he began working on skills as an outfielder, ostensibly {{in preparation for the}} arrival of minor league prospect Maikel Franco, regarded as a stronger defensive third baseman. In fact, the Phillies optioned Asche back to Triple-A on May 12 to accelerate his development as a left fielder, as Franco was hitting very well in the minor leagues, and could be ready for a promotion. Although surprised and disappointed by the move, Asche sought to trust the organization and play wherever it needed him. Ultimately, Asche struggled to find playing time during the remainder of the season, although MLB.com writer Todd Zolecki said that Asche would be given an opportunity in 2016 as the Phillies like his makeup, but the burden will be on him to produce results to justify the playing time, given the amelioration of other options at his positions.|$|E
5|$|Sevigny {{made her}} film debut with a {{lead role in}} the {{controversial}} film Kids (1995), written by her then-boyfriend Harmony Korine and received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for her performance. A long line of roles in generally well-received and often experimental films throughout the decade established Sevigny as <b>a</b> <b>mainstay</b> in the independent film community. In 1999, Sevigny gained recognition outside of the independent film world {{for her role as}} Lana Tisdel in the fact-based drama Boys Don't Cry, earning her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress. Other roles that followed included in American Psycho (2000), Party Monster (2003), Dogville (2003), The Brown Bunny (2003), Melinda and Melinda (2004), Manderlay (2005), and Zodiac (2007), the latter of which marked Sevigny's transition into a more big budget studio picture.|$|E
