5|$|Starfish are deuterostomes, closely related, {{together}} {{with all other}} echinoderms, to chordates, and are used in reproductive and developmental studies. Female starfishs produce large numbers of oocytes that are easily isolated; these {{can be stored in}} a pre-meiosis phase and stimulated to complete division by the use of 1-methyladenine. Starfish oocytes are well suited for this research as they are large <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> handle, transparent, simple to maintain in sea water at room temperature, and they develop rapidly. Asterina pectinifera, used as a model organism for this purpose, is resilient <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> breed and maintain in the laboratory.|$|E

It {{has been used in}} evolutionary biology research and to discover to what degree conclusions reached about other organisms, such as the fruit fly (Drosophila) and the housefly (Musca), are applicable to all insects. It is a suitable school laboratory animal because of its robustness and the ease with which it can be grown and handled.|$|E
5|$|Cowpea is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and virus diseases, which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and leaf spot. The plant is {{susceptible to}} mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E
5|$|Dogs {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are gentle <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, {{in accordance with the}} regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.|$|E

5|$|During the British Civil Wars (mid-17th {{century in}} Great Britain), both the Parliamentarian and Royalist armies used various {{incendiary}} devices to attack enemies and destroy property {{that might be}} used for military purposes, according to historian Stephen Porter in Destruction in the English Civil Wars. The flaming arrow attack was used to set fire to buildings at a distance. An arrow with a flammable substance attached to the shaft, close to the tip, was shot from a bow or short-muzzled musket. Such arrows shot from a musket had their feathers removed, to fit inside the muzzle, and were called fire-darts. These devices were cheap to make <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> prepare. Although used infrequently during the wars, the flaming arrows and darts proved to be destructive. The Royalists shot flaming arrows into the thatched homes {{in the suburbs of}} Chester causing extensive damage. Lyme Regis was partly razed using flaming arrows.|$|E
5|$|Forster wrote well-polished German prose, {{which was}} not only scientifically {{accurate}} and objective, but also exciting <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> read. This differed from conventional travel literature of the time, insofar as it presented {{more than a mere}} collection of data – it also demonstrated coherent, colourful and reliable ethnographical facts that resulted from detailed and sympathetic observation. He often interrupted the description to enrich it with philosophical remarks about his observations. His main focus was always on the people he encountered: their behavior, customs, habits, religions and forms of social organization. In A Voyage Round the World he even presented the songs sung by the people of Polynesia, complete with lyrics and notation. The book {{is one of the most}} important sources concerning the societies of the Southern Pacific from the times before European influence had become significant.|$|E
5|$|His {{first major}} work, the poem London, {{contains}} {{an early version}} of Johnson's ethics and morality system. Within the poem, he combined attacks on the politics of Walpole and the British government with the immoral actions of the common Londoner to form a general satire of 18th-century London society. Johnson compares London to the Roman Empire in its decline and blames moral and political corruption for its fall. Although Johnson did not start his literary criticism career until later, London is an example of what Johnson thought poetry should be: it is youthful and joyous, but it also relies on simple language <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> understand imagery.|$|E

5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to {{engage and disengage}} from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> fly {{on the edge of}} its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed.|$|E
5|$|Like all fairywrens, {{the splendid}} fairywren {{is an active}} and restless feeder, {{particularly}} on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. Movement {{is a series of}} jaunty hops and bounces, with its balance assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts. However, splendid fairywrens are stronger fliers than most other fairywrens. During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.|$|E

5|$|The RAAF's MirageIII pilots {{generally}} {{found the}} process of converting to the Hornet to be straightforward. While the F/A-18 {{was considered to be}} easier to fly, its more sophisticated avionics and weapons systems required improved cockpit workload management skills. The Hornets have also proven to be mechanically reliable <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> maintain, though shortages of spare parts reduced availability rates {{during the early years of}} their service with the RAAF. The updates installed as part of the HUG process have further simplified maintenance procedures. In recent years, however, the aging aircraft have required much more servicing than was the case in the past.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord is large, with stallions {{weighing}} {{upwards of}} , and is bred for traction ability and pulling power. The breed {{is found in}} many solid colors, although bay and roan are the most common, and {{is known to be}} gentle <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> handle. Two slightly different types of Trait du Nord are found – a larger type used for heavier pulling and a lighter type used for faster work. The breed is considered to be endangered by the French government, with fewer than 100 new foal births a year. The national breed registry in France is working with local groups in an attempt to promote this breed and bring population numbers back up. The breed currently has a high risk of inbreeding, due to the low number of breeding stallions, and is at risk of extinction.|$|E
5|$|The game {{featured}} advanced {{artificial intelligence}} {{due to the}} inclusion of the game's squad command system. Adams and Lugo will assist Walker in battles and react to the battle situation accordingly even if they are not given any orders. They will also analyse the situation when instructed and decide the best approach to defeat enemies. The battle command system was designed to be accessible <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> use, so that players would not have {{to spend a lot of}} time managing the squad. Lugo and Adams may get severely injured and if both of them die, the game ends. This mechanic prompts the player to rescue them as quickly as possible, and the system is designed to create tense situations. The AI for enemies is affected by various factors, including visibility and hearing.|$|E

5|$|The weapon {{consisted}} of a hollow metal tube attached to a tripod, with a rudimentary breech at one end. Rounds were fired {{with the use of}} black powder ignited by a standard musket percussion cap, and it had an effective range of between 100 and 150 yards. Although it was cheap <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> manufacture, it did have several problems; it was difficult to move and the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenades it used as one type of ammunition had a tendency to break inside the breech, damaging the weapon and injuring the crew. Production began in late 1940, and by the beginning of 1943 nearly 19,000 were in service. Like many obsolete Home Guard weapons, it was eventually replaced by other weapons, such as the 2-pounder anti-tank gun.|$|E
5|$|The white-winged fairywren is {{primarily}} insectivorous; its diet includes small beetles, bugs, moths, praying mantises, caterpillars, and smaller insects, including spiders. The larger insects are typically fed to nestlings by the breeding female and her helpers, including the breeding male. Adults and juveniles forage by hopping along the shrubland floor, and may supplement their diets with seeds and fruits of saltbush (Rhagodia), goosefoot (Chenopodium) and new shoots of samphire. During spring and summer, birds {{are active in}} bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during {{the heat of the}} day.

5|$|Despite {{being hired}} after the {{completion}} of nearly all the principal photography, Trumbull had an enormous amount of creative input on the film. The Spock spacewalk sequence, for example, was radically changed from the Abel version. The original plan was for Kirk to follow Spock in a spacesuit and come under attack from a mass of sensor-type organisms. Spock would save his friend, and the two would proceed through V'ger. Wise, Kline and Abel had been unable to agree on how to photograph the sequence, and the result was a poorly designed and ungainly effect that Trumbull was convinced was disruptive to the plot and would have cost millions to fix. Instead, he recommended a stripped-down sequence that omitted Kirk entirely and would be simple <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> shoot; Robert McCall, known for designing the original posters to 2001: A Space Odyssey, provided Trumbull with concept art to inform the new event.|$|E
