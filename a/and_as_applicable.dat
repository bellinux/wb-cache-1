5000|$|This {{translation}} is the outgrowth of a solemn conviction {{that such a}} work was required of the writer by Him Whose he is, and Whom he seeks to serve. The translator, A. S. Worrell, spent two and one-half years devoted to the work. It {{was done with the}} view of pleasing the Supreme Critic, at Whose judgment bar he will have to account for the manner in which he has handled His word.The work was begun and prosecuted under the distinct conviction that these New Testament Scriptures are the veritable word of God - His last revelation to this sin-cursed world. The translator believed that these Scriptures contain nothing but [...] "live matter;" [...] and that they are as true now <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>applicable</b> to man's needs as a tripartite being as they ever were.Absolute perfection is not claimed for this work, but there is confidence that there are many improvements that the intelligent reader will not fail to recognize. Some such examples are as follows: capitalization of the initial letter of every pronoun referring to deity, restriction of the solemn form of the pronouns and verbs to Deity alone, use of quotation marks to enclose a direct quotation, use of pronouns differently from the usual translation, and the clipping of uns from the preposition unto.This work claims greater fidelity to the original Greek - especially in the words baptidzo and [...] If these two words had been translated instead of transferred, many divisions in Christendom could have been avoided. The Greek text of Westcott and Hort, as modified by Scrivener and others, was used in the preparation of this work. The italic words have no word answering to them in the Greek text, but are often understood or implied.|$|E
5000|$|The supreme {{question}} is: Shall {{the laws}} of Oklahoma be enforced? One of the most mischievous tendencies of the present day is a disposition manifested among the people to set their individual judgments up against the law, and to assert their right not to obey any law unless it meets with their personal approval. This is anarchy, pure and simple. It is bad enough for private citizens to feel and act this way, but {{it is much more}} criminal for officials to do so, and the higher the official the greater the crime committed. All state officials have taken an oath to support {{the laws of}} the state. No Governor has the right to say, directly or substantially, either by words or by actions, which speak louder than words:"I think that capital punishment is wrong. I know that it is taught in the Bible, and is provided for in the laws of Oklahoma; but I occupy a higher plane than this. I am not such a barbarian as to believe this is right. I am a better judge of what punishment should be inflicted than is taught in the Bible, or than the ignorant, savage, and bloodthirsty people of Oklahoma have provided for in their laws. Therefore, notwithstanding my official oath, I will place my judgment above the law, both human and divine, and make my will supreme in this state, and will not permit capital punishment to be inflicted in Oklahoma, no matter what the law is, or how atrocious the offense committed may have been. All officials are only my personal servants and it is their duty to execute my orders, and not stop and inquire as to what the law is. The courts must recognize and bow to me as their master, and accept and follow my will as the supreme law; and if they dare to question my absolute right to do as I please about anything I will publicly brand such judges as fools and crooks, and charge that they have entered into a conspiracy with criminals and that they are using the law as a cloak to protect crime."Nothing could more impair the reputation of the state, nothing could be more demoralizing to respect for law, or more highly calculated to incite mob violence, than such conduct as this. We are taught in the Bible that:"Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil." [...] (Ecclesiastes viii, 11.)Some say that these passages of Scripture are obsolete, and are not applicable to the present age of moral enlightenment and civilization; but many occurrences have taken place in Oklahoma in recent years which prove that these teachings of the Bible, like all other divine laws, are just as true <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>applicable</b> to the people of this day as they were in ancient times. We very much fear that, if some assurance is not given to the people of Oklahoma that sentences will be executed in the future, matters will go from bad to worse. If officials place their individual views above and defy the law, how can they expect that the people will respect and obey the law? It is the duty of officials to set an example of obedience to law. If officials do not obey the law, can they blame the people for taking the law into their own hands?This court will not render a single opinion which can be used in excuse for mob violence. It will to the last extremity defend the exclusive {{right of the people to}} enact laws, and continue to demand, as it has uniformly done since the day of its organization, the strict enforcement of all of the laws of the state as enacted by the people or the Legislature, it matters not whose criticism and enmity it may incur thereby, or what amount of misrepresentation, abuse, and vilification may be heaped upon it therefor. The members of this court would be fools, cowards, and traitors if they took any other position.|$|E

40|$|International audienceRecent {{progress}} in nonlinear dynamic theory has inspired hydrologists to apply innovative nonlinear time series techniques {{to the analysis}} of streamflow data. However, regardless of the method employed to analyze streamflow data, the first step should be the identification of underlying dynamics using one or more methods that could distinguish between linear and nonlinear, deterministic and stochastic processes from data itself. In recent years a statistically rigorous framework to test whether or not the examined time series is generated by a Gaussian (linear) process undergoing a possibly nonlinear static transform is provided by the method of surrogate data. The surrogate data, generated to represent the null hypothesis, are compared to the original data under a nonlinear discriminating statistic in order to reject or approve the null hypothesis. In recognition of this tendency, the method of "surrogate data" is applied herein to determine the underlying linear stochastic or nonlinear deterministic nature of daily streamflow data observed from the central basin of Puget Sound, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>applicable,</b> distinguish between the static or dynamic nonlinearity of the data in question...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore images of {{mathematics}} held by undergraduate students and possible influencing factors. The image of mathematics in this study was conceptualized as the mental representations or views of mathematics as undergraduate students experienced during their academic journey through the interaction largely at school. Pierre Bourdieu’s construct of symbolic violence served as the theoretical lens to evaluate the students' images of mathematics. The design of this study was explorative qualitative and interpretive. Semi-structured interview was used to generate data texts from three participants who were senior undergraduate students studying mathematics at an affiliated college of Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu. From the thematic analysis and interpretation of the textual data, four common themes emerged as images of mathematics held by the participants. These themes were – mathematics as difficult and abstract, as decontextualized, as mysterious subject, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>applicable</b> in different fields. The influencing factors on the formation of these images were largely related to the curricular and pedagogical approaches from schools to university classes. These are conventional and disempowering methods of teaching, decontextualized curriculum and textbooks and other teaching learning resources, medium of instruction and nature of mathematics itself.  </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} results of {{petrographic}} analyses of raw materials used for making the ground stone industry implements in two Vinča culture sites Vinča and Belovode. The assemblages from the aforementioned sites feature a number of specific characteristics. In Vinča, in late strata, a kind of devaluation {{in the selection of}} stone raw materials is registered, which is closely related to the decline in quality of stone processing and may be a consequence of territorial narrowing of the Vinča culture per se in its later phases, and of introduction of metallurgy in everyday life. For this reason an analogy with the Belovode site was made, which subsists only throughout the early phase of the Vinča culture and is doubtlessly a metallurgic settlement. Petrographic analyses of the raw materials from which ground stone tools used to be made at the Vinča and Belovode sites are only a part of the commenced petro-archaeological research. They imply that further investigations should focuses on field work, principally {{in the vicinity of the}} sites themselves.

Approximately thirty Federal agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE), participate in the ICSSC. The ICSSC is chaired by the National Institute of Standards (NIST) which also provides the technical secretariat. EO 12941, Seismic Safety of Existing Federally Owned or Leased Buildings, were prepared and issued by the ICSSC to reduce the vulnerability to buildings owned or leased by agencies or departments for Federal use. This report documents the implementation of EO 12941 at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. ORNL is managed and operated by Lockheed Martin Energy Research, Inc.
