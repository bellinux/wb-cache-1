Atomic numbers of heavy metals are generally given as greater than 20 (calcium); sometimes this is capped at 92 (uranium). Definitions based on atomic number have been criticised for including metals with low densities. For example, rubidium in group (column) 1 of the periodic table has an atomic number of 37 but a density of only 1.532g/cm3, which is below the threshold figure used by other authors. The same problem may occur with <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> based definitions.|$|E

5|$|Praseodymium {{has only}} one stable and {{naturally}} occurring isotope, 141Pr. It is thus a mononuclidic element, and its standard <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> can be determined with high precision. This isotope has 82 neutrons, a magic number that confers additional stability. This isotope is produced in stars through the s- and r-processes (slow and rapid neutron capture, respectively).|$|E

50|$|During his career, Batuecas {{published}} {{more than}} 130 scientific papers. His research mainly involved determinations of <b>atomic</b> <b>weights,</b> either using density measurements of gases or X-ray crystallography. The work on <b>atomic</b> <b>weights</b> started in Geneva in 1916 with Guye, and was focused to evaluate Daniel Berthelot’s method of limiting densities for real gases. In Madrid (1924) Batuecas also became interested in X-ray crystallography to determine the <b>atomic</b> <b>weights</b> of elements.|$|R

5|$|The {{isotopes}} of titanium {{range in}} <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> from 39.99 u (40Ti) to 57.966 u (58Ti). The primary decay mode before {{the most abundant}} stable isotope, 48Ti, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission. The primary decay products before 48Ti are element 21 (scandium) isotopes and the primary products after are element 23 (vanadium) isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} of atomic numbers {{to the organization}} of the periodic table was not appreciated until the existence and properties of protons and neutrons became understood. Mendeleev's periodic tables used <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> instead of atomic number to organize the elements, information determinable to fair precision in his time. <b>Atomic</b> <b>weight</b> worked well enough in most cases to (as noted) give a presentation that was able to predict the properties of missing elements more accurately than any other method then known. Substitution of atomic numbers, once understood, gave a definitive, integer-based sequence for the elements, and Moseley predicted (in 1913) that the only elements still missing between aluminium (Z=13) and gold (Z=79) were Z = 43, 61, 72 and 75, all of which were later discovered. The sequence of atomic numbers is still used today even as new synthetic elements are being produced and studied.|$|E
5|$|Working with Edward W. Washburn {{from the}} Bureau of Standards, Urey {{subsequently}} discovered {{the reason for}} the anomalous sample. Brickwedde's hydrogen had been separated from water by electrolysis, resulting in depleted sample. Moreover, Francis William Aston now reported that his calculated value for the <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> of hydrogen was wrong, thereby invalidating Birge and Menzel's original reasoning. The discovery of deuterium stood, however.|$|E
50|$|The Commission on Isotopic Abundances and <b>Atomic</b> <b>Weights</b> (CIAAW) is an {{international}} scientific committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) under its Division of Inorganic Chemistry.

5|$|Around 1865 John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> and similar {{physical and chemical properties}} that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music, where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions. His version put all the alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and thallium (which show the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals), together into a group. His table placed hydrogen with the halogens.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen is a {{chemical}} element with symbol H and atomic number1. With a standard <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table.

5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements in 1869, the Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} several unknown chemical elements, including one that would fill {{a gap in the}} carbon family in his Periodic Table of the Elements, located between silicon and tin. Because of its position in his Periodic Table, Mendeleev called it ekasilicon (Es), and he estimated its <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> to be about 72.0.|$|E

5|$|Lead's {{close-packed}} face-centered cubic {{structure and}} high <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> {{result in a}} density of 11.34g/cm3, which is {{greater than that of}} common metals such as iron (7.87g/cm3), copper (8.93g/cm3), and zinc (7.14g/cm3). This density is the origin of the idiom to go over like a lead balloon. Some rarer metals are denser: tungsten and gold are both 19.3g/cm3, and osmium—the densest metal known—has a density of 22.59g/cm3, almost twice that of lead.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} silver {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 107Ag and 109Ag, with 107Ag being slightly more abundant (51.839% natural abundance). This almost equal abundance is rare in the periodic table. The <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> is 107.8682(2) u; this value is very important because {{of the importance of}} silver compounds, particularly halides, in gravimetric analysis. Both isotopes of silver are produced in stars via the s-process (slow neutron capture), as well as in supernovas via the r-process (rapid neutron capture).|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen has two stable isotopes: 14N and 15N.

This leads to an <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> of around 14.007u. Both of these stable isotopes are produced in the CNO cycle in stars, but 14N is more common as its neutron capture is the rate-limiting step. 14N {{is one of the}} five stable odd–odd nuclides (a nuclide having an odd number of protons and neutrons); the other four are 2H, 6Li, 10B, and 180mTa.|$|E
50|$|Richards was {{the first}} to show, by {{chemical}} analysis, that an element could have different <b>atomic</b> <b>weights.</b> He was asked to analyze samples of naturally occurring lead and lead produced by radioactive decay.

According to him, if the <b>atomic</b> <b>weights</b> were plotted as ordinates and the atomic volumes as abscissae—the curve obtained a series of maxima and minima—the most electro-positive elements appearing at the peaks of the curve in the order of their <b>atomic</b> <b>weights.</b>|$|R
