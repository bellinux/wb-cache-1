25|$|It {{usually takes}} me {{an hour after}} I awaken {{to get all the}} pain out. It used to be easier when I was younger. I have more muscle and joint {{difficulties}} now... Recently the only way I could get control over the pain was by sitting in bed, pulling a chair close, and pressing my larynx <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chair. That was very uncomfortable: But it was discomfort I was deliberately creating.|$|E
500|$|General Thielmann {{then led}} eight Saxon and two Polish cavalry squadrons <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> redoubt, while {{officers}} and sergeants of his command actually forced their horses through the redoubt's embrasures, sowing confusion {{and allowing the}} French cavalry and infantry to take the position. The battle had all but ended, with both sides so exhausted that only the artillery was still at work. At 15:30, the Raevsky redoubt fell {{with most of the}} 24th Division's troops. All the Russian cannoneers in Raevsky also died right next to their cannons, and General Likhachev was captured by the French. [...] But, besides the dead Russian troops were the corpses of 1000 Caulaincourt's cuirassiers, including Caulaincourt himself.|$|E
500|$|The {{pathologist}} {{arrived at}} the scene at 11:45. His report {{of the crime scene}} described [...] "the deceased lying on her back, with her leg bent at the thigh and knee, with the knee resting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seat, and the left thigh running {{along the edge of the}} seat with the leg hanging over the edge. The body was naked from the waist down and her left breast was exposed. Part of a pair of tights was pulled down to the left ankle. The remainder of her underwear and the other part of her tights was found in the passenger well." [...] The time of death was placed at between 01:00 and 02:00 (1:00 and 2:00a.m.) 5December. In a statement issued at the time, Detective Superintendent John Porter said: [...] "It is 99% certain that the girl was murdered, attacked, chatted to or met by her killer in a matter of seconds after Jenni Savage left her. He could have been waiting, and seen Jenni leave. It is possible that he was actually sitting in Teresa's car, as we found the nearside [...] door unlocked." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lambrick {{believed}} that raising the capstone on the Whispering Knights {{would have been}} the hardest task in the entirety of the Rollrights' construction, remarking that it was [...] "analogous" [...] to the raising of the lintels on Stonehenge. He suggested the possibility that the builders had constructed a ramp out of [...] "collected stones", which was then [...] "placed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber", with the capstone then being [...] "hauled up on rollers, probably running on logs embedded longitudinally in the ramp" [...] in order to get it into position.|$|E
2500|$|There are 15 consonants in the Kinaray-a language. They are Bb, Kk, Dd, Gg, Hh, Ll, Mm, Nn, NG ng, Pp, Rr, Ss, Tt, Ww, and Yy. They are {{pronounced}} {{the same way}} as in English but a little bit lighter than their English equivalents. An exception is the letter [...] "r" [...] which is prevalent in Kinaray-a. It is sounded by flicking the tip of the tongue <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper front teeth and rolled a bit. Likewise the letters g, w, and y are also pronounced a bit harder as a terminal letter of a word with a grave accent mark. Except for [...] foreign loan words, the consonants c, f, j, q, x, and z don’t appear in Kinaray-a words. If foreign words are without Kinaray-a equivalent, they are either written as is, or written as pronounced using the Kinaray-a alphabet.|$|E
2500|$|The paramedic's {{body was}} found {{strapped}} in to his seat with a severe, possibly fatal, head injury from an impact <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pilot's {{seat in front of}} him. Despite the death of both occupants of the aircraft, the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, or AAIB, considered the impact survivable by the pilot. Had the paramedic been wearing a shoulder harness, the AAIB concluded it was likely that the paramedic would have survived the impact with the water with little or no injury, though it is possible he might then have succumbed to the cold water. The pilot, whose uninjured {{body was found}} nine months after the accident, and who had been wearing a shoulder harness, most likely survived the accident and escaped the aircraft, only to die of hypothermia in the cold water. As a result of this accident, regulations were enacted in 2015 by the European Union (EU) that require all aircraft of similar size that are used to transport passengers to be equipped with a shoulder harness, or [...] "upper torso restraint system" [...] (UTR system), for each passenger seat.|$|E

5000|$|The {{leverage}} {{of muscle}} pull is decreased as <b>the</b> tendons pull <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> knee {{rather than a}} straight line down <b>back</b> <b>of</b> leg. This reduces power and speed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{what are}} you doing, Albe't?" [...] Mrs. Lander lamented, falling {{helpless}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> her seat. [...] "Haven't I always told you {{to speak to the}} hoss fust?" ...|$|R

60|$|A step {{sounded in}} the guard-room. He sank without a rustle {{into the chair}} from which he had risen, rested his head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> it, closed his eyes, opened his mouth, and dissembled sleep.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} there was a silence--a silence which Ramsden had to strive with an effort almost {{physically}} painful not to break. Rich oaths surged to his lips, and blistering maledictions crashed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> his clenched teeth.|$|R
6000|$|Osmond {{rested his}} head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> {{his chair and}} looked at his {{companion}} with a cynical directness which seemed also partly an expression of fatigue. [...] "You do aggravate me," [...] he remarked in a moment. [...] "I'm very tired." ...|$|R
60|$|His wife {{rested her}} elbows <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great red chair, and passed {{her fingers through}} the statesman's grizzled curls, stooping down {{as she did so}} until her lips were close to his ear.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is nice," [...] said Jeff, letting himself rest <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seat. He {{stretched}} {{his left arm}} along the top, and presently it dropped and folded itself about the waist of the girl.|$|E
60|$|As he re-entered {{the large}} room, she was {{standing}} beside the table, with one dainty hand resting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chair, her whole graceful figure bent forward as if in an agony of ardent expectation.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was silent}} for some time, sitting limply. Then he pressed his hand <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> his head, saying, [...] "My head does sing!" [...] He tried to get up, but failed. [...] "Good God!—being knocked into this state by a damned keeper!" ...|$|R

60|$|The {{party at}} the great round table {{dispersed}} slowly by two and threes. Wilhelmina and Deyes strolled into the winter-garden.

60|$|Bending over him, {{she took}} both the Doctor's hands, and looked {{steadily}} into his eyes. No words passed between them; nothing more took place. In {{a minute or}} two, his head was resting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chair, and his eyelids had closed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lie down--lie down!" [...] snapped Littlefield. [...] "Close to the horse--flat on the ground--so."

6000|$|... 'Very well delivered--plaguily so!' quoth {{the little}} officer, {{clapping}} {{the palm of}} one hand softly <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other.

6000|$|Up to {{that moment}} I had been leaning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a garden chair. Something else now got {{between me and my}} chair.

60|$|Grace Harvey {{sees the}} coming storm, {{as she goes}} slowly homewards, dismissing her little flock; and she lingers long and sadly outside her cottage door, {{looking out over the}} fast {{blackening}} sea, and listening to the hollow thunder of the groundswell, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> point which shelters Aberalva Cove.|$|E
60|$|He braced his leg <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cab.

It slowed down, then came to a halt. One of the tyres had burst.|$|E
60|$|The grocer greeted Mrs. Markham in. a perfunctorily kind {{manner and}} offered her a chair, which she took gratefully. She sat {{for a quarter of}} an hour almost without moving, leaning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high chair. At last the child began to get restless and troublesome, and she spent half an hour helping him amuse himself around the nail kegs.|$|E
60|$|The little {{elephant}} set {{the door}} of the parlour open, enabling me to see that, in these latter days, it was converted into a bedroom for Mr. Omer who could not be easily conveyed upstairs; and then hid her pretty forehead, and tumbled her long hair, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> Mr. Omer's chair.|$|R
