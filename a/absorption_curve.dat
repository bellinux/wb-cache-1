Thus even at a fairly high dilution, it has an absorption maximum at ~600-615 nm, which is actually not the absorption maximum of a dye monomer but that of the multimer. Since the absorbed light is of yellow orange spectrum, the transmitted/reflected light is perceived by our eye as the complementary color of slightly greenish blue or cyan. In {{aqueous solution}} Alcian blues continue to be metachromatic at molar concentrations one hundredth those at which toluidine blue is mainly orthochromatic. Only a very small shoulder of the <b>absorption</b> <b>curve</b> at 670-680 nm represent the monomeric dye, which is usually the minority and becomes even lesser minority (<108M) in presence of salts. However, when the solvent is DMSO—a non-protic solvent of moderately high dielectric constant, Alcian blue does not aggregate and a big monomeric absorption peak can be well visualized.

In the patitents with the administion of PAS, the value of glucuronic acid was generally increased in blood and urine, and it's blood value was 8. 8 mg/dl on the average and it's excretive dosis into urine was 549 mg. The Nylander's reaction showed a weak or strong positive in 2 of 17 cases urine. 2. The glucose level in blood and the glucuronic acid level in urine were measured in each fasting and after-meal condition, and the correlation between each of them and Nylander's reaction was investigated. The correlation between the glucose level in blood and the Nylander's reaction was not observed, but {{the correlation between the}} glucuronic acid level in urine and the Nylander's reacton was observed. 3. On the esperimental administration of PAS, the excretive dosis of glucuronic acid into urine showed the highest level after 90 or 120 minutes of the administration, in non-hepatic disease or health, and came down to the level, which was shown before the administration, after 4 hours of the administration, but it showed the highest level after 3 or 4 hours of the administration in liver disease. Therefore, it was supposed that PAS was combined with glucuronic acid and excreted into urine and this combination had a connection with liver function. 4. Since the results that glucuronic acid was separated from the PAS-glycosuria which was experimentally provoked on rabbit and was qualitatively tested, it was supposed that there was the compound of glucuronic acid and PAS and the combination was an esterfrorm. On the examination of the separated solution by the paper chromatography, the existence of glucose was denied and the separation between PAS and glucuronic acid could be obtained after the hydrolysis.

The validity criteria were based on the similarity of the spectral <b>absorption</b> <b>curves</b> to ex vivo curves of lutein and zeaxanthin and the similarity of spatial density profiles to those measured in subjects without retinal disease. Macular pigment optical density (MPOD) spatial profiles were measured with an LED-based macular densitometer; spectral <b>absorption</b> <b>curves</b> were measured with a 3 -channel Maxwellian view system including a monochromator. All patients were characterized via clinical exams and all but 2 subjects from whom data were obtained had masked grading of color fundus photographs using the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System. Most of the patients were in AREDS category 2 (27 %) or 3 (57 %). Patients with visual acuity as poor as 20 / 80 were included, and could perform the task as long as they could see the stimulus. Eighty-one percent of the patients screened were able to perform the cHFP task, and data were obtained from 30 AMD patients.
