500|$|After redshirting his {{freshman}} year in 1980–81 {{because he could not}} yet get clearance from the NCAA to play, Olajuwon played sparingly as a redshirt freshman in 1981–82, and the Cougars were eliminated in the Final Four by the eventual NCAA champion, North Carolina Tar Heels. Olajuwon sought advice from the coaching staff about how to increase his playing time, and they advised him to work out with local Houston resident and multiple NBA MVP winner, Moses Malone. Malone, who was then a center on the NBA's Houston Rockets, played games every off season with several NBA players at the Fonde Recreation Center. Olajuwon joined the workouts and went head to head with Malone in several games throughout the summer. Olajuwon credited this experience with rapidly improving his game: [...] "The way Moses helped me is by being out there playing and <b>allowing</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go against that level of competition. He was the best center in the NBA at the time, so I was trying to improve my game against the best." ...|$|E
500|$|Fraser and Navarro {{write that}} it was Evita's work with the {{foundation}} that played {{a large role in}} her idealization, even leading some to consider her a saint. Though it was unnecessary from a practical standpoint, Evita set aside many hours per day to meet with the poor who requested help from her foundation. During these meetings with the poor, Evita often kissed the poor and allowed them to kiss her. Evita was even witnessed placing her hands in the suppurated wounds of the sick and poor, touching the leprous, and kissing the syphilitic. Fraser and Navarro write that though Argentina is secular in many respects, it is essentially a Catholic country. Therefore, when Evita kissed the syphilitic and touched the leprous she [...] "...ceased to be the President's wife and acquired some of the characteristics of saints depicted in Catholicism." [...] Poet , a man from a wealthy background, reflected on the times he witnessed Evita meeting with the poor: [...] "I had had a sort of literary perception of the people and the poor and she had given me a Christian one, thus <b>allowing</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> become a Christian in the profoundest sense...." ...|$|E
