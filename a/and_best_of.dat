500|$|The {{book has}} been derided for its lack of suspense. [...] Carol Memmott of USA Today says that Grisham's latest attempt to capture {{the spirit of the}} legal David and Goliath story is missing [...] "the ratcheting-up of suspense" [...] that he has {{employed}} successfully in recent adult and youth novels. Harshaw claims that the book is lacking in the suspense that made The Firm so successful. Arthur finds elements of the plot implausible and the story unsuspenseful as well as unsatisfying. Although the book is somewhat predictable, Bayard notes that [...] "Grisham swerves clear of the usual melodramatic devices. Corporations aren’t intrinsically venal; plaintiffs aren’t lambent with goodness. <b>And</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> all, no one is murdered for stumbling Too Close to the Truth." ...|$|E

It soon disappeared quietly and utterly." [...] Rolling Stone wrote: [...] " [...] is the first of his bold, conceptual departures from country's hits-plus-filler norm. Rather than tack rock guitar riffs onto modern honky-tonk sagas, Nelson absorbed the innovations of Bob Dylan and the singer-songwriters into his own distinct style. Even if the narrative concepts don't always hold together, Willie hangs his most ambitious albums on some of his catchiest tunes." ...|$|E

500|$|While Saw {{received}} mixed reviews, {{a general}} consensus among reviewers was that {{fans of the}} film series would enjoy it. Reviewer for Xbox 360 Achievements Alan Pettit wrote that while he enjoyed the game, {{it was not an}} outstanding title. Pettit commented that the game suffered due to the choice of Zombie Studios as the developer and that the franchise could be successful if a sequel was made with changes in developer and budget. Although he claimed it was repetitive, Pettit mentioned that [...] "If there was only one thing the game did well, I'd say the puzzles that are put before you are excellently constructed, well thought out <b>and</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> all, difficult enough that you may not get it on your first attempt."

In light of its measly $1.2 million price tag the film's quality relative to bigger-budget horror films is striking. It also takes itself seriously, which came as {{a breath of fresh}} air following the trend of wimpy tongue-in-cheek horror that had dominated the multiplexes post-Scream. More than anything, this twisted morality tale is a film made by horror fans, for horror fans; it's gory, it's depraved, <b>and</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> all it introduced a new horror icon in Jigsaw."

500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} miniseries a [...] "B", {{noting that the}} event [...] "loses steam when it {{moves away from the}} introspective {{personal}} elements of the past to detail Marceline and her friends' vampire hunting adventure in the present." [...] He also bemoaned the fact that only [...] "Everything Stays" [...] features flashbacks, arguing that [...] "rushing through those past events is a missed opportunity to offer a more comprehensive look at where Marceline comes from and how those circumstances have shaped her". With that being said, Sava was highly complimentary towards the voice acting, with praise being directed towards Olson and the actors who voice the villains; Sava wrote, [...] "The new characters' personalities are quickly solidified by the guest stars' expressive performances." [...] Eric Thurm of Pitchfork Media opined that Stakes [...] "includes all sorts of cool action sequences <b>and,</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> all, it focuses on the backstory of the show's most musical character: Marceline [...] But Stakes, as fun as it is, ultimately fails to fully deliver, mostly because of a lack of, um, stakes." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode premiered to near {{universal}} critical acclaim. Ramsey Isler of IGN gave it 9.6/10, {{and thought}} it was [...] "one of the most balanced and well-executed episodes of the series, Fringe fans get action, suspense, emotion, <b>and</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> all, some revelations!... This episode is nearly everything a Fringe fan could have asked for... Besides the awesomeness with the Bishops, Olivia finally returns to taking an active role in an episode... But {{the most important thing is}} that the overarching Fringe plot finally progressed, and it's going in a pretty damn good direction". Jane Boursaw from TV Squad enjoyed the episode because it had a [...] "few reveals and a nice cliffhanger." [...] She liked the interactions between Walter and Peter, and also praised the scene between Olivia and Newton. Josh Wigler of MTV was pleased that the [...] "mystery of the week" [...] also tied into the ongoing plot, and that answers were provided to certain mysteries, such as why Walter's behavior and personality is [...] "a little...off. Pretty interesting stuff. It's nice to finally have a reason to point at for Walter's craziness".|$|E

500|$|Heber {{was soon}} commemorated in print; {{as well as}} the {{publication}} of his hymns collection in 1827, the journal that he had kept during his northern India tour of 1824–25 was published in 1828 and proved a great commercial success. Less popular was the three-volume biography and letters collection that Amelia published in 1830. In the ensuing years various collections of Heber's poetry appeared. Hughes observes that although some of the lighter verses are neat and amusing, the general quality is such that had Heber been only a poet, he would quickly have been forgotten. He achieved a more lasting niche as a hymn-writer; according to Hughes, among his hymns with enduring appeal are the Epiphany hymn [...] "Brightest <b>and</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> the sons of the morning"; [...] "The Son of God Goes Forth to War", dedicated to the church's saints and martyrs, and the Trinity Sunday hymn [...] "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty". The last one is probably the most widely known of all Trinity hymns and owes a great deal of its popularity to John Bacchus Dykes's tune [...] "Nicea": Watson observes that the tune's [...] "magnificent grandeur carries the long lines effortlessly". Hughes mentions two more Heber hymns that, he says, deserve to be better known: [...] "God that madest earth and heaven" [...] and [...] "By cool Siloam's shady rill".|$|E

The first full-length trailer was also released in October.

Naturally, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark gets the best lines". However, The Hollywood Reporter called it, [...] "Awesome. Or {{it would be if}} we hadn't seen all of this before and expected every single thing that we saw in the trailer". The trailer, which debuted exclusively on iTunes Movie Trailers, was downloaded over 10million times in its first 24 hours, breaking the website's record for the most-viewed trailer. This record was surpassed by the trailer for The Dark Knight Rises, which was downloaded more than 12.5million times in its first 24 hours. The trailer received 20.4 million views in the 24 hours after it debuted. A second full-length trailer was released on iTunes in February 2012, reaching a record 13.7million downloads in 24 hours.

500|$|Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club was not {{positive}} in his review, describing [...] "Future Husband" [...] as the [...] "laziest" [...] {{episode of the}} fourth season. Nonetheless, Pierce responded favorably to Tracy's one-man show, calling it the [...] "shortest <b>and</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> the plots" [...] and [...] "even manages to get a laugh out of that old 'I'd watch him reading the phone book' chestnut." [...] Sean Gandert for Paste magazine said in his recap that part of this episode was disappointing, writing that the main plot was not [...] "too awful, [...] just comparatively dull." [...] Though, he was positive towards the show's interpretation of the NBC and Kabletown storyline, saying {{it was a nice}} [...] "little riff" [...] on the actual merger between NBC and Comcast. Gandert was appreciative to Elizabeth Banks' small part, and hoped to see her in future episodes. Entertainment Weekly contributor Margaret Lyons opined it was a [...] "strange" [...] episode of 30 Rock, and concluded [...] "It's not that 'Future Husband' was radically terrible or anything, but wow, that episode just did not click into place." [...] Bob Sassone of TV Squad did not enjoy Jenna's involvement in Tracy's story, and that overall he did not find their antics [...] "too funny".
