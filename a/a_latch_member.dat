40|$|A {{device for}} connecting, {{rotating}} and locking together {{a pair of}} structural half columns is described. The device is composed of an identical pair of cylindrical hub assemblies connected at their inner faces by a spring loaded hinge; each hub assembly having a structural half column attached to its outer end. Each hub assembly has a spring loading locking ring member movably attached adjacent to its inner face and includes <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> <b>member</b> for holding the locking ring in a rotated position subject to the force of its spring. Each hub assembly also has a hammer member for releasing the latch on the opposing hub assembly when the hub assemblies are rotated together. The spring loaded hinge connecting the hub assemblies rotates the hub assemblies and attached structural half columns together bringing the inner faces of the opposing hub assemblies into contact with one another...|$|E
40|$|<b>A</b> preloadable vector-sensitive <b>latch</b> which {{automatically}} releases {{when the}} force vector from <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> memebr reaches <b>a</b> specified release angle is presented. In addition, it contains means to remove clearance between the <b>latched</b> <b>members</b> and to preload the latch to prevent separation at angles {{less than the}} specified release angle. The <b>latch</b> comprises <b>a</b> triangular main link, a free link connected between a first corner of the main link and a yoke member, a housing, and an actuator connected between the yoke member and the housing. A return spring bias means connects the main link to {{a portion of the}} housing. A second corner of the main link is slidably and pivotally connected to the housing via a slot in a web portion of the housing. The <b>latch</b> housing has <b>a</b> rigid docking ring alignable with a mating locking ring which is engageable by a locking roller journalled on the third corner of the triangular main link...|$|R

A plunger member carried by the pin member is axially moveable between first and second positions. In the first plunger position, the <b>latch</b> <b>members</b> are located in the expanded (locked) position and in the second plunger position the <b>latch</b> <b>members</b> are released for movement to retracted or unlocked position. The magnetic end effector is provided for releasable attachment to the first object and for moving the plunger member to the second position, releasing the first object...|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>latch</b> or catch (called sneck in Northern England and Scotland) {{is a type}} of {{mechanical}} fastener that joins two (or more) objects or surfaces while allowing for their regular separation. <b>A</b> <b>latch</b> typically engages another piece of hardware on the other mounting surface. Depending upon the type and design of the latch, this engaged bit of hardware may be known as a keeper or strike. Note that <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> {{is not the same as}} the locking mechanism of a door or window, although often they are found together in the same product.|$|R

40|$|Existing {{literature}} on combinational equivalence checking concentrates on comparing combinational blocks and assumes that <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> mapping (register mapping) {{has already been}} constructed. We describe an algorithm for automatically constructing <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> mapping. It {{is based on the}} functionality of the circuits being compared rather than on heuristics. As a result, if two circuits are combinationally equivalent, then our algorithm is guaranteed to find <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> mapping. Our empirical results show that the method is practical on large circuits. 1. Introduction When applied to a pair of sequential circuits, combinational equivalence checking typically consists of two steps. The first step is to construct <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> mapping (also known as a register mapping). This identifies corresponding latches in the two designs to be compared. It is then possible to break the circuits into corresponding combinational blocks. The second step is to verify whether the corresponding combinational blocks are equ [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A payload {{retention}} device for grappling and retaining a payload in docked {{position on a}} supporting structure in the cargo bay of a space vehicle is presented. The device comprises a two-fault tolerant electromagnetic grappling system comprising electromagnets for attracting and grappling a grapple strike plate affixed to the payload when in proximity thereto and <b>an</b> electromechanical <b>latching</b> assembly comprising <b>a</b> pair of independent latching subassemblies. Each subassembly comprises <b>a</b> set of <b>latching</b> pawls which are driven into latching and unlatching positions relative to a grappled payload {{by a pair of}} gearmotors, each equipped with a ratchet clutch drive mechanism which is two-fault tolerant with respect to latching such that only one gearmotor of the four needs to be operational to effect <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> of the payload but is single fault tolerant with respect to release of <b>a</b> <b>latched</b> payload. Sensors are included for automatically sensing the magnetic grappling of a payload and for automatically de-energizing the gearmotors of the <b>latching</b> subassemblies when <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> condition is achieved...|$|R

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>latching</b> relay (also called [...] "impulse", [...] "keep", or [...] "stay" [...] relays) {{maintains}} either contact position indefinitely {{without power}} {{applied to the}} coil. The advantage is that one coil consumes power only for an instant while the relay is being switched, and the relay contacts retain this setting across a power outage. <b>A</b> <b>latching</b> relay allows remote control of building lighting without the hum that may be produced from a continuously (AC) energized coil.|$|R

40|$|Clustered voltage scaling {{is a power}} {{reducing}} method {{which does}} not affect the overall system performance. The main idea is to run gates on a non-critical path by a low-voltage supply. Since low-voltage gates are not able to drive high-voltage gates, level-converters are needed. In order {{to reduce the number of}} level-converters, which may cancel out the power savings, they are arranged in a cluster just before <b>a</b> <b>latch.</b> First, <b>a</b> non-critical path is identified. Then the gates (starting at the end of the path) are replaced by low-voltage gates. If the path is still uncritical, more gates can be replaced. A main advantage of placing the low-voltage gates in front of <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> is that the level converters can be combined with the <b>latch,</b> leading to <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> with level-conversion function (LCF) [1]. Strategies for clustered voltage scaling can be found in [1] and [2]...|$|R
50|$|Various {{types of}} knives with folding or {{retractable}} blades rely on latches for their function. A switchblade uses an internal spring {{to produce the}} blade which is {{held in place by}} <b>a</b> button-activated <b>latch.</b> Likewise <b>a</b> ballistic knife uses <b>a</b> strong <b>latch</b> to restrain <b>a</b> powerful spring from firing the blade as a projectile until triggered by opening the <b>latch.</b> <b>A</b> gravity knife relies on <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> to hold the folding blade in an open position once released. A balisong uses <b>a</b> single <b>latch</b> to hold the folding blade both open and closed, depending on the position of the handles; by rotating 180 degrees the same latch can be used in either configuration. Balisong latches have numerous variations, including magnetic variants and some which can be opened via a spring when the handles are squeezed together.|$|R
50|$|In {{cases where}} the {{parallel}} outputs should not change during the serial loading process, it is desirable to use <b>a</b> <b>latched</b> or buffered output. In <b>a</b> <b>latched</b> shift register (such as the 74595) the serial data is first loaded into an internal buffer register, then upon receipt of a load signal {{the state of the}} buffer register is copied into a set of output registers. In general, the practical application of the serial-in/parallel-out shift register is to convert data from serial format on a single wire to parallel format on multiple wires.|$|R

The frame is in two parts, held {{together}} by <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> on the top rear of the cylinder. For a swing out cylinder, the cylinder is mounted on a pivot that is coaxial with the chambers, and the cylinder swings out and down. Some designs, such as the Ruger Super Redhawk or the Taurus Raging Bull, use <b>a</b> <b>latches</b> at the front and rear of the cylinder to provide a secure bond between cylinder and frame.|$|R
