50|$|Between 1994 and 2005 John {{hosted the}} weekday version of New Day Australia. In 2006, his on <b>air</b> <b>shift</b> {{was changed to}} the weekend edition of the show. Radio {{announcer}} Stuart Bocking replaced John in the weekday shifts of New Day Australia.|$|E

50|$|He {{moved to}} North Queensland in January 2004, he {{continued}} his radio work, beginning work for DMG Regional Radio, doing various on <b>air</b> <b>shifts</b> at Townsville radio stations 4TO FM and Hot FM.|$|R
50|$|In August 2012, the Thom and Jeff' afternoonhow was {{replaced}} with midday jock Donny, and Ashley became a full-time jock in middays, and then in February 2013 Donny and Ashley swapped on <b>air</b> <b>shifts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|He later {{worked at}} KULF (CHR) in Houston, {{where he had}} an on <b>air</b> <b>shift.</b> While working the {{afternoon}} drive position at Big WAYS(WAYS)in Charlotte NC, he met WAYS morning personality Robert Murphy, aka [...] "Murphy in the Morning" [...] who later went to Chicago and did mornings at WKQX-FM.|$|E

Extend your right leg forward and you should land at 180 degrees of your previous position.|$|E
50|$|Cumulus {{then began}} to use anyone and {{everyone}} in the building to pull air shifts. The station played just music in the morning and ran jox-less, middays was a revolving door with anyone filling in, middays was Voice tracked by Dan Mclintock as he had a live <b>air</b> <b>shift</b> on 94.5 WXKR, and nights was run jockless.|$|E
50|$|The station {{presently}} broadcasts {{around the}} clock, having gone to that schedule in 1986. Most of its on-air staff consists of professionals, although students do cover some weeknight and weekend on <b>air</b> <b>shifts.</b> Students {{also play a}} key role in behind-the-scenes functions.|$|R
30|$|The {{possibility}} to observe motion in realtime sonography repeatedly {{proved to be}} decisive for the certain diagnosis of free <b>air</b> (the <b>shifting</b> <b>air</b> under patient movement and the immobility of the gas reflex under respiration).|$|R
50|$|The studios {{were located}} in an area {{north of the city}} of Albany near a swamp. The area {{surrounding}} the station was low country and covered with water most of the time. A raised walkway led from the small parking lot to the studio. Many deejays were delayed in their <b>air</b> <b>shifts</b> because a fat cottonmouth snake would be sunning themselves on the walkway.|$|R
50|$|MIchael Venditti was {{a member}} of The Word Outreach Center, a Non Denominational Church in Del Rio during this time. The church was pastored by Michael Kyle, a native of Del Rio and {{longtime}} broadcaster himself, having worked in both local radio stations and with Paul Kallinger. Michael Kyle worked an <b>air</b> <b>shift</b> at the station in Mexico when the format went to all music.|$|E
50|$|Riggs {{started his}} career in radio at KCR (SDSU's College Radio) in 1992 {{and worked as a}} DJ on every <b>air</b> <b>shift</b> offered at the station. After less than six months at KCR, Riggs became the Program Director and {{remained}} at that position for several years until he advanced to the position of Operations Manager. His tenure at KCR lasted over four years until he left in February 1997.|$|E
5000|$|Former WXQW mid-day host Chuck Boozer, {{apparently}} local, {{was actually}} the evening host at WWMG-FM in Charlotte, North Carolina. Boozer recorded his WXQW <b>air</b> <b>shift</b> in about forty minutes on a computer in Charlotte as digital voice tracks for later playback {{on the air in}} Huntsville. This use of [...] "voice tracking" [...] is a practice common to many Clear Channel-owned radio stations, as then-WXQW was at that time.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1990s, K-Love {{also began}} to expand its on-air personalities. David Pierce joined in 1991. Also Mike Novak, [...] JD Chandler and Larry Wayne started working <b>air</b> <b>shifts</b> in the late 1990s. In {{addition}} to expanding the on-air talent, K-Love expanded its facilities and moved its headquarters from Santa Rosa to Sacramento in 1993. In 1998 K-Love increased its reach online by streaming live on klove.com.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Distribution of intra-airway {{temperatures}} {{suggest that}} most of the exchange of heat during a breathing cycle occurs within the upper airway (1, 2). An exception to this may occur when hyperventilating cold <b>air</b> <b>shifts</b> the thermal burden at least partially into the lung (3), such as occurs during exercise in cold air. This increased lung thermal burden may be exacerbated by low body core temperatures, resulting in reduce...|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} {{is very popular}} in the sport of drag racing today, with units equipped with manual valve bodies and transbrakes, {{some of which are}} <b>air</b> <b>shifted.</b> It is also widely used in off-road applications due to its reputation of being nearly indestructible. It does, however, have a reputation of greatly reducing performance as well as fuel mileage, due to the amount of power it requires to operate.|$|R
5000|$|Strictly speaking, voice-tracking {{refers to}} the process of a disc jockey {{prerecording}} his or her on-air [...] "patter". It is then combined with songs, commercials, and other elements in order to produce a product that sounds like a live <b>air</b> <b>shift.</b> Voice-tracking has become common on many music radio stations, particularly during evening, overnight, weekend, and holiday time periods. It is seen by most radio station owners as an economical alternative to employing live disc jockeys around the clock.|$|E
50|$|The {{permanent}} sign-off of WRMR {{was made}} more poignant just days later {{after the death}} of signature WRMR personality Bill Randle, on July 11, 2004. The final day of programming on WRMR was punctuated with the final installment of a long-running music program hosted by Randle that had been pre-recorded just days earlier. Carl Reese hosted the final <b>air</b> <b>shift</b> from 7 pm until sign-off at midnight; fittingly, he {{was also one of the}} first voices heard on WRMR when it signed on back in June 1985.|$|E
5000|$|Afternoon host [...] "Mr. Bill", {{apparently}} local, {{is actually}} Charlotte, North Carolina, radio host Bill Summerville. Summerville records his five-hour <b>air</b> <b>shift</b> in about forty minutes {{on a computer}} in Charlotte as digital voice tracks for later playback on the air at WTAK-FM. This use of [...] "voice tracking" [...] is a practice common to many Clear Channel-owned radio stations. WTAK-AM and WAAY-AM had a local Mr. Bill show in the 1970s and 1980s hosted by Bill McClendon. (McClendon is now a weekend on-air personality at WLRH-FM.) ...|$|E
50|$|This {{is seldom}} {{much of a}} problem, and can be {{corrected}} by simply trimming the shoulders up until the air balances between the sides. It does however mean that if the diver rolls to one side <b>air</b> will <b>shift</b> to the upper side and tend to hold the diver in this position. Similarly if a diver trims steeply head up or down, the air will flow to the higher end of the BC and this will tend to keep the diver stable in this position. This can be exacerbated by similar but more extreme <b>air</b> <b>shifts</b> in a dry suit, which {{is the main reason}} why dry suits should be dived with the minimum air necessary to expand the undersuit.|$|R
50|$|WPUM (93.3 FM) is a {{non-commercial}} educational {{radio station}} begun in 1977 in Rensselaer, Indiana, United States, owned by Saint Joseph's College. The format is primarily contemporary hit radio and Oldies hosted by Saint Joseph's College students in hour <b>air</b> <b>shifts.</b> The station also broadcasts the school's sports programs {{and can be}} listened {{to live on the}} Internet at WPUM's website. The station is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Its coverage area includes Rensselaer and Jasper County, Indiana.|$|R
50|$|China Eastern Airlines, Jet Airways, Qatar Airways and United Airlines {{also moved}} {{operations}} {{to the terminal}} on 1 January 2008, while Kingfisher Airlines launched services to Singapore using T3 in 2009. Garuda Indonesia, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Vietnam Airlines and Sri Lankan Airlines have also moved operations to T3 in 2011. In 2013, Asiana Airlines and Lion Air have also moved operations to T3. Ethiopian Airlines and Spring Airlines used to operate from Terminal 3. On 2 July 2015, China Airlines and EVA <b>Air</b> <b>shifted</b> its operations to T3.|$|R
5000|$|WAXO was Kenosha's second modern-day {{radio station}} after WLIP and {{was billed as}} [...] "The new voice {{of a new and}} greater Kenosha". WAXO's first station manager was {{longtime}} broadcaster Roy Ambrose of Manitowoc, Wisconsin; Paul Weyrich was the first program director and Don Jensen was the first news director. Subsequent station managers included Richard Blaha and Darrell Gorr. In a late-1968 promotional stunt, WAXO announcer Gary Anderson held a record for constant on-air broadcast duties by performing an <b>air</b> <b>shift</b> of 96.9 hours.|$|E
5000|$|The station {{first began}} {{broadcasting}} in 1964 under the WERX call sign. WERX {{began as a}} MOR station but changed to Top 40 {{during the summer of}} 1965, and enjoyed moderate success as a Top 40 rocker until dropping the format in May 1968. The station's potential was always limited due to its poor signal and the fact that co-channel WCKY would begin to interfere with WERX's signal even before WERX's sign-off (and still does to this day). WERX provided an early <b>air</b> <b>shift</b> for John [...] "Records" [...] Landecker, later of WLS fame.|$|E
50|$|Circa 1979-80, KENR {{management}} {{brought in}} Joe Formicolla {{to be the}} new program director. At times he also filled in on-air. Although his distinct northern accent was a handicap for being on-air in Texas country music, Formicolla did bring the concept of dropping interesting trivia into the course of an <b>air</b> <b>shift,</b> requiring all jocks to do likewise. They actually read items from sources such as The National Enquirer, etc. Formicolla left KENR circa 1981 and later was awarded Country Music DJ of the Year by the Country Music Association and recognized during its annual awards TV program from Nashville.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Riggs was {{recruited}} by Halloran at another independent alternative station in San Diego, 92/1 KFSD-FM (Premium Radio). There he co-hosted the local show (Go Loco) with Rick Savage, a new music show, an interview show (Coup D'état) and work various <b>air</b> <b>shifts</b> throughout the week. In 2003, when 92/1 started negotiations {{to sell the}} signal to KSON-FM, Riggs {{was hired by the}} popular San Diego rocker, ROCK 105.3 KIOZ-FM where he hosted an alternative/indie rock show (The Inside Track) and a unique interview show (Guerilla Radio) on Sunday nights. In January 2007, Riggs left ROCK 105.3 to concentrate on his job as Director of Radio Programming at Slacker, Inc.|$|R
50|$|The station {{signed on}} the air on September 30, 1962, then owned by the Market Square Presbyterian Church, hence the {{original}} call letters WMSP. It was run as a volunteer radio station, parishioners volunteered to do <b>air</b> <b>shifts,</b> broadcasting a Classical Music format. The station was sold in 1988 to Barnstable Broadcasting, who changed the format to a bland Adult Contemporary first, then an Oldies format, KOOL 94.9. In 1995, Barnstable switched formats and call letters with its 99.3 signal, turning the 94.9 signal into WYMJ Magic 94.9. The generic mix format never did well and Barnstable put all of its Harrisburg market stations for sale in late 1996.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a process}} of {{achieving}} sustainable mosquito control in an eco friendly manner by providing artificial breeding grounds utilizing common household utensils and destroying larvae by non-hazardous natural means such as throwing them in dry places or feeding them to larvae eating fishes like Gambusia affinis, or suffocating them by spreading a thin plastic sheet over the entire water surface to block atmospheric <b>air.</b> <b>Shifting</b> the water with larvae to another vessel and pouring a few drops of kerosene oil or insecticide/larvicide in it is another option for killing wrigglers, but not preferred due to its environmental impact. Most of the ornamental fishes eat mosquito larvae.|$|R
50|$|A WGMU air band contest {{caught the}} {{attention}} of Denise Benoit, the promotion director of WAVA-FM. She contacted Murphy and hired him as her intern for the summer of 1984. At the end of his internship, Murphy was hired by the station as its assistant promotion director, a position he held until 1986. During 1985 Murphy was heard on the air reading snow closing announcements in the morning or doing an occasional weekend <b>air</b> <b>shift.</b> He was most often heard as part of Don Geronimo's afternoon drive program, especially when the show would broadcast from local bars on Friday afternoons.|$|E
50|$|Runyon {{was born}} in West Virginia {{and grew up in}} Williamson, where his father owned a {{furniture}} store. He had an early interest in radio and started out as a janitor at a radio station in Welch, West Virginia. When the station's regular announcer did not arrive for work one Saturday morning, Runyon convinced the station manager to let him go on the air. This worked out to be a regular <b>air</b> <b>shift</b> for him until it was learned that he was only thirteen years old. The state's Child Welfare Department intervened, and Runyon had to leave the airwaves until his fourteenth birthday.|$|E
5000|$|Jocks {{during the}} later KEGL era include T.C. McGuire, Michael Blake, Pamela Steele (who quit the station on May 28, 1993, over a Howard Stern {{promotion}} the station participated in, where Steele {{was asked by}} Donna Fadal to appear alongside other KEGL female personalities donning sports bras), Nancy Johnson, Marc Richards, Edward [...] "Fast Eddie" [...] Coyle, Andre Gardner, Tracy Barnes, Leigh Ann Adam, Bubba Stewart, Darren [...] "Dangerous" [...] Silva, Brad Baxter, Mike Esparza (host of [...] "The Mikey Morning Show").

5000|$|During {{his high}} school summers, he worked with a New York concert promoter, an {{arrangement}} {{that allowed him to}} meet with radio personalities from Top 40 powerhouse WABC and #1 Soul station WWRL as well as with many recording artists and record industry executives. Taking classes at C.W. Post College, Harrison worked several [...] "fill in" [...] <b>air</b> <b>shifts</b> on WCWP and created a show called An Introduction To Soul. He soon interned at WWRL in Woodside Queens where he honed his radio production skills and filled in on Sundays, setting up gospel [...] "remotes" [...] for churches throughout Brooklyn and Harlem (New York).|$|R

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{programming}} change, in 1999, KUNV studios and business offices {{were moved to}} the former KWNR studios located at 1515 E. Tropicana Ave Ste 240, {{a few blocks away}} from campus. The move was due in part to renovations scheduled for the MSU but may also have been to remove the contested station from the campus community. The station operated off-campus for just over 10 years, primarily being run by a professional staff with a large number of community volunteers hosting <b>air</b> <b>shifts.</b> Student involvement over the decade slowly increased but the station was not well known to the student body and few students made the trip to the building.|$|R
