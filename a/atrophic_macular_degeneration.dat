40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} wedge-shaped subretinal hyporeflectivity, {{a peculiar}} spectral domain {{optical coherence tomography}} finding in geographic atrophy (GA) areas of <b>atrophic</b> age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> METHODS: We reviewed the charts of consecutive patients with GA who presented between January 2012 and December 2013. A standardized imaging protocol was performed in all patients, which included blue fundus autofluorescence, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: Wedge-shaped subretinal hyporeflective lesions were found in 12 of 161 included eyes (11 of 94 consecutive patients, 6 males/ 5 females, mean age 79. 6 ± 9. 3 years). On spectral domain optical coherence tomography, regions immediately adjacent to the wedge-shaped subretinal hyporeflective lesions were characterized by absence of the hyporeflective outer nuclear layer, the hyperreflective external limiting membrane, the ellipsoid zone, the interdigitation zone, and the retinal pigment epithelium. On "en face" images, they appeared as round-oval hyporeflectivities delimited by hyperreflective borders, which we interpreted as the outer plexiform layer. Mean GA area was significantly larger in eyes with as compared with eyes without wedge-shaped subretinal hyporeflective lesions. Overall, {{the dimensions of the}} wedge-shaped subretinal hyporeflective lesions did not change after a mean of ∼ 15 months. CONCLUSION: Wedge-shaped subretinal hyporeflectivity, a previously unreported peculiar finding in GA areas of <b>atrophic</b> age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> eyes, appears delimited internally by the hyperreflective outer plexiform layer and externally by the hyperreflective Bruch membrane. These lesions, which are detected in eyes with large GA (even though stable over time), should be recognized and distinguished from subretinal fluid (and other exudative signs of age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration)</b> because their presence should not require prompt treatment...|$|R

Methods: Case report of an 85 -year-old man with a past ophthalmic history of <b>atrophic</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> underwent a penetrating keratoplasty for Fuchs’ endothelial corneal dystrophy. Postoperative review revealed a retained retrocorneal membrane within the anterior chamber.

40|$|Background: Evolving <b>atrophic</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> {{represents}} {{at least}} 80 % of all macular degenerations {{and is currently}} without a standardized care. Autologous fat transplantation (AFT) efficacy was demonstrated by several studies, since these cells are able to produce growth factors. The aim of the work was to demonstrate possible therapeutic effect of the joined suprachoroidal graft of adipocytes, adipose derived stem-cells (ADSCs) in tissue adipose’s stromal vascular fractions (SVF), and platelet rich plasma (PRP). Methods: Twelve eyes in 12 dry age macular degeneration (AMD) patients, aged 71. 25 (SD ± 6. 8) between 62 and 80 years, were analyzed. A complete ocular evaluation was performed using: best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), retinographic analysis, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, microperimetry, computerized visual field, and standard electroretinogram (ERG). Each eye received a cell in graft between choroid and sclera {{by means of the}} variant second Limoli, grafting of mature fat cells and ADSCs in SVF enriched with PRP (LRRT). In order to test if the differences pre- and post-treatment were significant the Wilcoxon signed rank test has been performed. Results: Adverse effects were not reported in the patients. After surgery with LRRT the most significant increase in the ERG values was recorded by scotopic rod-ERG (answer coming from the rods), from 41. 26 to 60. 83 μVolts (µV) with an average increase of 47. 44 % highly significant (p< 0. 05). Moderately significant was the one recorded by scotopic maximal ERG (answer coming from the rods and cones), from 112. 22 to 129. 68 μV with an average increase of 15. 56 % (p< 0. 1). Conclusions: Cell-mediated therapy based on growth factors used appears interesting because it can improve the retinal functionality responses in the short term.

40|$|The {{retinitis}} pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) gene is mutated in several forms of photoreceptor degeneration resulting in severe {{visual impairment and}} probably blindness. Most patients develop Retinitis pigmentosa(RP), which is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by degeneration initially of rod and later in disease also of cone photoreceptors. Mutations in RPGR were also described in patients with cone-rod dystrophy, cone dystrophy, Coats’ like exsudative vitreoretinopathy and <b>atrophic</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> Additionally, the spectrum of diseases due to RPGR mutations was further expanded by describing patients with a syndromic phenotype including RP, sinorespiratory infections and hearing problems and in patients manifesting with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). To date, no phenotype-genotype correlation could be established. Evidence exist that genetic modifiers might act on disease expressivity as one mutation can lead to different phenotypes even within one family. In order {{to gain a better}} understand the function of RPGR, two mouse models for RPGR-related diseases have been characterized in this study. The transgenic mouse line with Rpgr-overexpression of the wild type protein exhibits infertility. In contrast,the knock-in mouse model, harbouring a deletion of exon 4, develops either rod disease or cone-rod disease depending on the genetic background (BL/ 6 or BALB/c, respectively). The difference in retinal manifestations in the mouse resembles the clinical heterogeneity in humans. In addition, mislocalization of visual pigments was found to be an early pathologic event further mounting evidence that RPGR might be involved in the transport of proteins. Overall, the two mouse models further support the assumed function of RPGR in cilia and flagella. RPGR was for the first time shown to be involved in mouse flagellar biogenesis and can therefore be regarded as a novel candidate gene for male infertility. In addition, the knock-in mouse on the BALB/c background serves as a model for cone-dominated phenotypes including cone dystrophy, cone-rod dystrophy and even macular degeneration.

Using age- and light-induced subretinal inflammation and photoreceptor degeneration in Cx 3 cr 1 knockout mice, we show that subretinal Cx 3 cr 1 deficient MPs overexpress CCL 2 and that both the genetic deletion of CCL 2 or CCR 2 and the pharmacological inhibition of CCR 2 prevent inflammatory monocyte recruitment, MP accumulation and photoreceptor degeneration in vivo. Our study shows that contrary to CCR 2 and CCL 2, CX 3 CR 1 is constitutively expressed in the retina where it represses the expression of CCL 2 and the recruitment of neurotoxic inflammatory CCR 2 (+) monocytes.

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Accumulation of {{lipofuscin}} in {{the retina}} {{is associated with}} pathogenesis of <b>atrophic</b> age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> and Stargardt disease. Lipofuscin bisretinoids (exemplified by N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine) seem to mediate lipofuscin toxicity. Synthesis of lipofuscin bisretinoids depends on the influx of retinol from serum to the retina. Compounds antagonizing the retinol-dependent interaction of retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP 4) with transthyretin in the serum would reduce serum RBP 4 and retinol and inhibit bisretinoid formation. We recently showed that A 1120 (3), a potent carboxylic acid based RBP 4 antagonist, can significantly reduce lipofuscin bisretinoid formation in the retinas of Abca 4 −/ − mice. As part of the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network project we undertook the in vitro exploration to identify novel conformationally flexible and constrained RBP 4 antagonists with improved potency and metabolic stability. We also demonstrate that upon acute and chronic dosing in rats, 43, a potent cyclopentyl fused pyrrolidine antagonist, reduced circulating plasma RBP 4 protein levels by approximately 60 %...|$|R

The disease {{progresses}} slowly over time, eventually causing loss of central vision. Its cause and pathomechanism {{are not fully}} known. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} vitreoretinal traction (VRT) may contribute to the progression of neovascular AMD. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine whether an association between changes at the vitreoretinal interface (VRI), in particular traction (VRT), and the characteristics and progression of GA in eyes with dry AMD can be established. DESIGN Clinic-based prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS A total of 97 patients (age range, 61 - 90 years; mean, 78. 4 years) with GA secondary to dry AMD were enrolled.

Design: A prospective, 9 -month, double-masked randomized controlled trial. Setting: Aston University, Birmingham, UK and a UK optometric clinical practice. Subjects: Age-related maculopathy (ARM) and <b>atrophic</b> age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (AMD) participants were randomized (using a random number generator) to either placebo (n = 10) or active (n= 15) groups. Three of the placebo group and two of the active group dropped out. Interventions: The active group supplemented daily with 6 mg lutein combined with vitamins and minerals. The outcome measure was contrast sensitivity (CS) measured using the Pelli-Robson chart, for which the study had 80 % power at the 5 % significance level to detect a change of 0. 3 log units.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to fully characterize the macular dystrophy phenotype and genotype in a large family of the Zermatt area of Switzerland. Clinical and molecular studies of the family included a comprehensive eye examination and a mutational analysis of the RDS, rhodopsin, and TIMP- 3 genes. In selected cases, fluorescein angiography, perimetry, and electroretinography were performed. Forty-two family members at risk of expressing the maculopathy were studied. Of these, 24 were found to be clinically affected. The severity of macular disease in these patients was clearly age-related and different stages of progression were identified. Central pigmentary alterations were seen in adolescent patients, while patients in their late teens and twenties exhibited drusen-like deposits. Later, these defects formed focal areas of atrophy which eventually led to central geographic atrophy with severe visual loss by the fifth decade and cone-rod dysfunction. The transmission of this condition is autosomal dominant with complete penetrance. The underlying genetic defect is a mutation in codon 172 of the RDS/peripherin gene, a gene expressed in both rods and cones, which results in the substitution of tryptophan for an arginine residue at that position. 'Zermatt macular dystrophy' is a dominant, age-related, progressive macular dystrophy which in later stages resembles <b>atrophic</b> age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> The size of the family studied allowed definition of the clinical spectrum of this condition and identification of the related genetic defect which allows more precise diagnosis and counseling...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in the peripherin/RDS gene, the BEST 1 gene, and the CFH gene {{appear to}} be {{relatively}} frequent causes of hereditary retinal diseases that principally affect the macula. Intriguingly, a single mutation {{may be associated with}} a broad range of retinal phenotypes. Even in a single family, one mutation may show a striking phenotypic variability. Best vitelliform macular dystrophy, caused by mutations in the BEST 1 gene, and retinal dystrophies caused by peripherin/RDS gene mutations, are good examples of such variability. This phenotypic variation can only be explained by additional genetic and environmental modifying factors. Conversely, a particular phenotype, such as multifocal vitelliform dystrophy or basal laminar drusen, can be genetically heterogeneous. Despite this variability, distinct genotype-phenotype correlations may be observed in association with specific peripherin/RDS, BEST 1, and CFH gene variants. Some phenotypes can be remarkably similar. Multifocal pattern dystrophy simulating Stargardt disease/fundus flavimaculatus, caused by autosomal dominant peripherin/RDS gene mutations, may be confused with autosomal recessive Stargardt disease, which is caused by mutations in the ABCA 4 gene. Central areolar choroidal dystrophy, caused by autosomal dominant peripherin/RDS mutations with decreased penetrance, may closely resemble <b>atrophic</b> age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (AMD). Basal laminar drusen is another phenotype that may be particularly difficult to discern from AMD. This is not surprising, as both conditions are associated with specific variants in the CFH gene. The differential diagnosis of hereditary retinal diseases becomes more difficult in cases of overlapping age at onset and non-penetrance. A combination of well-established but also relatively new imaging techniques such as fundus autofluorescence is useful in the differentiation of these entities. Molecular genetic analysis is able to establish the definitive diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the clinical characteristics, follow-up data and molecular genetic background {{in a large}} group of patients with central areolar choroidal dystrophy (CACD). DESIGN: Retrospective case series study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred three patients with CACD from the Netherlands. METHODS: Ophthalmologic examination, including color vision testing, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, optical coherence tomography, full-field electroretinography (ERG), multifocal ERG, and electrooculography. Blood samples were obtained for DNA extraction and subsequent analysis of the peripherin/RDS gene, as well as haplotype analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical characteristics, phenotypic range, clinical follow-up data, and FAF findings. RESULTS: The mean age at onset of visual loss was 46 years, with subsequent gradual deterioration in visual acuity. Ninety-eight patients carried a p. Arg 142 Trp mutation in peripherin/RDS, whereas 5 affected members of a CACD family carried a p. Arg 172 Gln peripherin/RDS mutation. A remarkable variation in disease severity was observed, and nonpenetrance was seen up to the age of 64 years, in up to 21 % of mutation carriers. However, most macular lesions in mutation carriers displayed a typical stage of CACD. Substantial changes were seen on FAF imaging after a mean follow-up period of 11 months. Electrophysiologic data were consistent with a central cone dystrophy. The age at onset and phenotypic characteristics of CACD show considerable overlap with <b>atrophic</b> age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (AMD). The great majority of p. Arg 142 Trp-carrying CACD patients originated from the southeast region of the Netherlands, and haplotype analysis strongly suggested a common founder mutation. CONCLUSIONS: When caused by a p. Arg 142 Trp mutation in the peripherin/RDS gene, CACD causes a central cone dystrophy phenotype. This mutation, which most likely originates from a common founder in most patients, is associated with a significant degree of nonpenetrance.

Methods 37 mixed gender patients {{with a mean age}} of 76. 3 +/- 7. 8 years were enrolled at 5 independent study sites and received standard of care with a novel formulation of a nutritional supplement. Results were compared to a placebo cohort constructed from the literature that was matched for inclusion and exclusion criteria. A paired t-test was used to test a null hypothesis and a two-sided alpha level of 0. 05 was used to determine statistical significance. Results 76. 7 % of subjects receiving the nutritional supplement demonstrated stabilization or improvement of BCVA at 6 months. Subjects gained an average of 0. 0541 logMAR or one-half of a line of visual acuity (VA) over the 6 -month period. There was a statistically significant improvement in VA from baseline with P =. 045. The results provide strong evidence that the treatment being studied produces an improvement in VA. Conclusion Treatment with this unique nutritional supplement increased VA above the expected baseline decrease in the majority of patients in this population with dry <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> The results of the TOZAL study agree with the LAST and CARMIS studies and are predictive for positive visual acuity outcomes in the AREDS II trial.

Case report A 44 year old man presented with a 1 month history of metamorphopsia. He had minimal dysmorphic features but was noted to have an antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures with mild flattening of the midface. Sensorineural deafness had been diagnosed from childhood but the external ears were normal in appearance. Best corrected visual acuity was 6 / 9 (22. 25 DS) right eye and 6 / 24 (21. 50 DS) left eye. Ocular examination revealed bilateral posterior embryotoxon with adhesions between iris and Schwalbe’s line, and iris hypoplasia. No eyelid colobomata were present. Posterior segment examination (fig 1) revealed <b>atrophic</b> <b>macular</b> degenera-tion in both eyes and a choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV) in the left eye confirmed on fluorescein angiography. No drusen were seen in either eye. Mutation screening of TCOF 1 gene was instigated because his facial appearance and deafness suggested possible TCS.

40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{a highly}} conserved post-transcriptional gene silencing process triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in eukaryotic cells. Elucidation of the RNAi regulatory pathway and its components {{has led to the}} identification of endogenous dsRNA molecules, termed microRNAs (miRNAs), which are transcribed as a single hairpin molecule prior to their maturation into a cytoplasmic dsRNA. The efficient gene silencing achieved by these short hairpin RNA (shRNA) molecules and the cumulative understanding of the RNAi pathway has prompted the development of hairpin expression vectors capable of mediating stable gene silencing in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the efficacy of viral vector-mediated RNAi in the retina using recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAV) and lentiviruses that contain silencing hairpin cassettes to target four genes in murine photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). A detailed assessment of the utility and extend of RNAi in the retina using different viral vectors and hairpin designs is presented in this thesis. Lentiviral and AAV vectors were firstly used to silence GFP in vitro and in vivo as a proof of concept for vector mediated RNAi in the retina. Subsequently, we used lentivirally-mediated RNAi to study disease processes in the retina concentrating on tight junction (TJ) modulators ZO- 1 and ZONAB and their role in RPE homeostasis, cell-cycle progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here we demonstrated how TJ misregulation can lead to RPE loss, proliferation or dedifferentiation; processes involved in pathological conditions such as <b>atrophic</b> age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (AMD) and proliferative vitroretinopathy (PVR). Whilst lentivirally-mediated RNAi was used to elucidate aspects of retinal function and disease, AAV-mediated RNAi was used to probe the therapeutic potential of shRNAs by silencing Peripherin- 2 (Prph 2), the second most abundant retinal protein, using a miRNA-based hairpin. AAV 2 / 8 particles were used to target endogenous Prph 2 and evasion of silencing was demonstrated using an engineered Prph 2 cDNA {{that could be used in}} a suppression and replacement approach for the treatment of dominant retinal disorders. ...|$|R

In the UK, age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> is the cause of blindness in almost 42% of those who go blind aged 65-74 years, almost two-thirds of those aged 75-84 years, and almost three-quarters of those aged 85 years or older.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{determine}} whether poor fetal growth, {{as determined by}} size at birth, is associated with increased risk of age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> METHODS. A total of 660 men and women born in Sheffield, United Kingdom, between 1922 and 1930 and whose size at birth was available were traced and invited {{to take part in}} the study. Of these, 392 attended for ophthalmic examination. Age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> in these volunteers was determined by the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System. RESULTS. The mean birth weight of subjects with <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (early or late) was heavier than that of those without (7. 6 lb vs. 7. 3 lb, respectively; P = 0. 03). After adjustment for age, gender, and risk factors for <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> a significantly increased risk of <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> was found in subjects with higher birth weight (odds ratio [OR] 1. 5, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 1 – 2. 0 for each SD [1 lb, 5 oz] increase in birth weight). Other parameters describing size at birth showed a weaker relation or no relation with <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> but one of the measures of fetal proportion (head circumference-to-birth weight ratio) was significantly associated with risk of <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> Subjects with <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> had a significantly lower head circumference-to-birth weight ratio than did those without (11. 2 vs. 12. 0 respectively, P = 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS. The finding that age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> was associated with increased rather than decreased birth weight was unexpected. Failure of the developing fetus’s normal brain-sparing mechanism is a possible explanation for our finding of a lower head circumference-to-birth weight ratio among subjects with <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> <br/...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} oxidant/antioxidant status and protein oxidation {{in the development of}} age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> METHOD: The activities of serum superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase and the levels of serum malondialdehyde, advanced oxidation protein products, glutathione and vitamin C were measured in 25 patients with age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> and 25 control subjects without age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> RESULT: The malondialdehyde and advanced oxidation protein product levels in the serum were significantly higher in the age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> patient group than in the control group (p 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The {{results of the present study}} suggest that decreased effectiveness of the antioxidant defense system and increased oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration...</b>|$|R

40|$|PURPOSES: To {{assess the}} risk factors of age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> in Argentina using a case-control study. METHODS: Surveys were used for subjects' {{antioxidant}} intake, age/gender, race, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes (and type of treatment), smoking, sunlight exposure, red meat consumption, fish consumption, presence of age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> and family history of age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> Main effects models for logistic regression and ordinal logistic regression were {{used to analyze the}} results. RESULTS: There were 175 cases and 175 controls {{with a mean age of}} 75. 4 years and 75. 5 years, respectively, of whom 236 (67. 4 %) were female. Of the cases with age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> 159 (45. 4 %) had age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> in their left eyes, 154 (44. 0 %) in their right eyes, and 138 (39. 4 %) in both eyes. Of the cases with age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> in their left eyes, 47. 8 % had the dry type, 40. 3 % had the wet type, and the type was unknown for 11. 9 %. The comparable figures for right eyes were: 51. 9 %, 34. 4 %, and 13. 7 %, respectively. The main effects model was dominated by higher sunlight exposure (OR [odds ratio]: 3. 3) and a family history of age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (OR: 4. 3). Other factors included hypertension (OR: 2. 1), smoking (OR: 2. 2), and being of the Mestizo race, which lowered the risk of age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (OR: 0. 40). Red meat/fish consumption, body mass index, and iris color did not have an effect. Higher age was associated with progression to more severe age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> CONCLUSION: Sunlight exposure, family history of age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> and an older age were the significant risk factors. There may be other variables, as the risk was not explained very well by the existing factors. A larger sample may produce different and better results...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} early and late-stage age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (ARMD) and its association with risk factors such as age, gender, smoking, body mass index, hypertension and diabetes history, cataracts and pseudophakia. Design: Population-based cross-sectional study in an elderly Japanese-Brazilian population from Londrina (Paraná, Brazil). METHODS: The study included 483 (80. 5 %) of the 600 registered members of a local association for Japanese immigrants and their descendants, aged 60 years and up. The presence of early and late-stage age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> was determined using the standard protocol and the international classification system. RESULTS: The {{mean age of the}} study subjects was 71 years. The overall prevalence of age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> was 15. 1 % (CI 95 %; 12 - 18. 7). The prevalence of early-stage age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> was 13. 8 % (CI 95 %; 10. 9 - 17. 3), geographic atrophy was present in 0. 4 % and neovascular age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> in 0. 8 %. Age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> was significantly (p= 0. 004) and linearly (p= 0. 001) associated with age. CONCLUSION: Our study population displays a prevalence of early and late-stage age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> and component lesions similar to those of other Western countries, and data suggest a higher prevalence than that reported for populations in Japan. Since the age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> prevalence tends to rise as the population ages, studies identifying risk factors and exploring prevention methods are becoming increasingly important...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Spectral sensitivities were {{measured}} in 18 normal eyes, 9 eyes {{in patients with}} senile <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> 4 patients with Stargardt's juvenile <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (JMD), and 2 patients without conclusive signs-that is, genetic or morphological abnormalities-to indicate the cause of loss of central vision. Spectral sensitivity, testing for which included measurements on white, yellow, purple, and blue backgrounds, is here used as an aid in differential diagnosis for cases of <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> <b>Macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> may be classified {{by the age of}} onset of symptoms, fundus appearance, and/or hereditary patterns. The measurement of spectral threshold may be used in the categorisation of the degeneration as an aid in differential diagnosis.
