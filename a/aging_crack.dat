40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} performance of a self compacting concrete (SCC) with fibers, during the cement hydration process and the evolution in to a rigid material, was carried out. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the improvement of the hardened performance due to the use of fibers and the early <b>age</b> <b>cracking</b> control ability of fibers at two different scales: on a nano-structural level with the addition of carbon nano-fibers (CNF) and on a micro-structural level with the addition of polypropylene micro-fibers. The inclusion of nanofibers increased the flexural strength of cement based pastes although some problems concerning early <b>age</b> <b>cracking</b> emerged. As any other concrete, SCC can exhibit problems during the very early ages after mixing, when cement hydration occurs, as shrinkage and early cracking. Although these problems arise during early ages, their effect can seriously compromise the long term performance and durability of the material. SCC samples with and without fibers were monitored through its hardening process using several experimental techniques and considering the effect of water evaporation due to wind exposition during the setting process. The effect of the fibers and different SCC components, as nanosilica, and a high range water reducing admixture (HRWRA), was analysed.

In-situ temperature, ultrasonic pulse velocity, mass loss and free drying shrinkage of samples subjected to a wind flow were simultaneously monitored for 24 hours. Profiles of the reaction process, the microstructural evolution and the physical effects of water evaporation were obtained. The early age measured parameters were related to a reaction index (Ir, 24), defined as the fraction of heat produced (accumulated plus released) {{with regard to the}} total heat at 24 hours.

All the concretes studied were moist cured for 7 -days. It was found that, at lower slag replacement levels (0, 35 and 50 %), the tensile strength decreased with increasing slag replacement.

40|$|For many {{concretes}} and mortars, self-desiccation {{results in}} the creation of empty capillary porosity within the cement paste microstructure, accompanied by a decrease in achieved hydration, an increase in internal stresses, and an increased propensity for early <b>age</b> <b>cracking.</b> One solution to this problem for low water-to-cement ratio concretes where external curing is ineffective has been the development of internal curing. In internal curing, water reservoirs, typically being either fine lightweight aggregates with a high moisture content or superabsorbent polymer particles, are distributed uniformly throughout the concrete microstructure and undergo desiccation themselves, while maintaining saturated conditions within the hydrating cement paste. Since these reservoirs typically contain pores that are much larger than those in the hydrating cement paste, the internal stresses are significantly reduced and early <b>age</b> <b>cracking</b> can be avoided. To date, these internal reservoirs have been filled with water only. Here, it is proposed to fill them with solutions of chemical admixtures such as shrinkage-reducing admixtures or corrosion inhibitors. Two possible advantages of the autogenous distribution of chemical admixtures over delivery by conventional addition to the mixing water are the mitigation or avoidance of possible detrimental interactions between chemical admixtures or detrimental influences of the admixture on fresh concrete properties and a potentially more efficient delivery of admixtures that are partially absorbed by the cement during hydration and in the resulting hydration products. Preliminary results for the FLAIR (Fine Lightweight Aggregates as Internal Reservoirs) system are presented for the case of a shrinkage-reducing admixture. It is envisioned that the FLAIR technology will have the greatest applicability to chemical admixtures that effect the properties of the hardened concrete (as opposed to the fresh concrete), such as shrinkage-reducing admixtures, corrosion inhibitors, and admixtures employed to mitigate alkali-silica reactions...|$|R

This autogenous shrinkage can be significant and can be a contributing factor to early <b>age</b> <b>cracking.</b> Internal curing was investigated as a potential method to improve the durability of concrete pavements and bridge decks. Prewetted lightweight aggregate was used to supply water to the hydrating cement paste. This additional water can counteract the hindered strength development, suspended hydration, autogenous shrinkage, and early <b>age</b> <b>cracking.</b> An overview of the concepts behind internal curing was presented. It is important the internal curing agent (lightweight aggregate (LWA) in this case) : be able to provide a sufficient volume of water, has a structure that allows the water to be released to the paste as needed, and is small enough so that they can be appropriately spaced in the matrix. Local materials were used. Before concrete could be prepared the locally produced LWA was characterized to determine absorption and desorption properties. Concrete mixtures were prepared for concrete with and without internal curing. A constant aggregate volume was maintained. Tests performed on these mixtures were designed to measure: autogenous shrinkage, drying shrinkage, plastic shrinkage cracking, drying shrinkage cracking, autogenous shrinkage cracking, water absorption, compressive strength, elastic modulus, tensile strength, thermal cracking and freeze-thaw resistance. Internally cured mixtures showed less autogenous shrinkage. In addition they were less likely to crack due to plastic, autogenous, and drying effects. Internal curing reduced the water absorption and potential for freeze-thaw damage. Further, internal curing allowed a greater temperature swing in the concrete before cracking would occur.

The causes of early <b>age</b> <b>cracking</b> are primarily attributed to plastic shrinkage, temperature effects, autogenous shrinkage, and drying shrinkage. The cracks can be influenced by material characteristics, casting sequence, formwork, climate conditions, geometry, and time dependent factors. The cracking of bridge decks not only creates unsightly aesthetic condition but also greatly reduces durability. It leads to a loss of functionality, loss of stiffness, and ultimately loss of structural safety. This investigation consists of field, laboratory, and analytical phases. The experimental and field testing investigate the early <b>age</b> transverse <b>cracking</b> of bridge decks and evaluate the use of sealant materials. The research identifies suitable materials, for crack sealing, with an ability to span cracks of various widths and to achieve performance criteria such as penetration depth, bond strength, and elongation.
