25|$|It is {{difficult}} to detect most gases {{that are likely to}} be present in diving cylinders because they are colourless, odourless and tasteless. Electronic sensors exist for some gases, such as oxygen <b>analysers,</b> helium analyser, carbon monoxide detectors and carbon dioxide detectors. Oxygen <b>analysers</b> are commonly found underwater in rebreathers. Oxygen and helium <b>analysers</b> are often used on the surface during gas blending to determine the percentage of oxygen or helium in a breathing gas mix. Chemical and other types of gas detection methods are not often used in recreational diving, but are used for periodical quality testing of compressed breathing air from diving air compressors.|$|E

Using lexical transducers for our <b>analyser</b> we have improved both the performance of the different components of the system and the description itself.

25|$|The world's first {{nuclear power}} plant was {{commissioned}} on June 27, 1954 in Obninsk. Soviet scientists made a major contribution {{to the development of}} computer technology. The first major achievements in the field were associated with the building of analog computers. In the USSR, principles for the construction of network <b>analysers</b> were developed by S. Gershgorin in 1927 and the concept of the electrodynamic analog computer was proposed by N. Minorsky in 1936. In the 1940s, the development of AC electronic antiaircraft directors and the first vacuum-tube integrators was begun by L. Gutenmakher. In the 1960s, important developments in modern computer equipment were the BESM-6 system built under the direction of S. A. Lebedev, the MIR series of small digital computers, and the Minsk series of digital computers developed by G.Lopato and V. Przhyalkovsky.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the accuracy of the Lactate Pro hand-held <b>analyser</b> in measuring blood lactate levels. METHODS: Blood was drawn from 15 healthy dogs into five tubes containing Na-EDTA. Lactate was measured immediately using the Lactate Pro <b>analyser</b> and a laboratory reference method. Further samples were analysed 120, 240, 480 and 1440 minutes later to artificially increase the lactate levels. Lactate was measured in blood samples of 60 healthy dogs using the Lactate Pro <b>analyser</b> to determine the reference interval of lactate concentration in normal dogs. RESULTS: The correlation between the lactate concentration measured with the Lactate Pro <b>analyser</b> and the reference method was high. Lactate levels were lower when measured with the handheld <b>analyser</b> than with the traditional laboratory determination. The reference interval for blood lactate concentrations in healthy dogs established by the Lactate Pro <b>analyser</b> was from the detection limit (0. 8 mmol/l) up to 3. 3 mmol/l. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The Lactate Pro <b>analyser</b> provides quick and reliable measurements of blood lactate in dogs with blood lactate levels up to 10 mmol/l. Because of its small sample size, this <b>analyser</b> will be particularly appropriate for use in small animal intensive care...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the design of}} a phosphate <b>analyser</b> that utilises a microfluidic lab-on-a-chip.

Our contribution is a methodology in which components of traditional termination analysis are combined with backwards analysis to obtain an <b>analyser</b> for termination inference. We identify a condition on {{the components of the}} <b>analyser</b> which guarantees that termination inference will infer all modes which can be checked to terminate. The application of this methodology to enhance a traditional termination <b>analyser</b> to perform also termination inference is demonstrated. ...|$|R
25|$|EDX spectrometers are {{different}} from WDX spectrometers {{in that they are}} smaller, simpler in design and have fewer engineered parts, however they are not as accurate. WDX has greater resolution power than EDX. They can also use miniature X-ray tubes or gamma sources. This makes them cheaper and allows miniaturization and portability. This type of instrument is commonly used for portable quality control screening applications, such as testing toys for lead (Pb) content, sorting scrap metals, and measuring the lead content of residential paint. On the other hand, the low resolution and problems with low count rate and long dead-time makes them inferior for high-precision analysis. They are, however, very effective for high-speed, multi-elemental analysis. Field Portable XRF <b>analysers</b> currently on the market weigh less than 2kg, and have limits of detection on the order of 2 parts per million of lead (Pb) in pure sand.|$|E

Ingersoll and Zobel state {{that in many cases}} the calculation involved makes the solution [...] "well-nigh impossible" [...] by analytical means. [...] With modern technology such a calculation is trivially easy, but Ingersoll and Zobel recommend the use of harmonic <b>analysers,</b> which are the mechanical counterpart of today's spectrum <b>analysers.</b> [...] These machines add together mechanical oscillations of various frequencies, phases and amplitudes by combining them through a set of pulleys or springs; one for each oscillator.

500|$|Slotted {{lines are}} {{relatively}} cheap and can perform {{many of the}} measurements done by more expensive equipment such as network <b>analysers.</b> [...] However, slotted line measurement techniques are more labour-intensive and often do not directly output the desired parameter; some calculation or plotting is frequently required. [...] In particular, they can only carry out a measurement at one spot frequency at a time so producing a plot of a parameter versus frequency is very time consuming. [...] This is to be compared to modern instruments like network and spectrum <b>analysers</b> which are intrinsically frequency swept and produce a plot instantly. [...] Slotted lines have now largely been superseded, but are still found where capital costs are an issue. [...] Their remaining uses are mostly in the millimetre band, where modern test apparatus is either prohibitively expensive or not available at all, and with academic laboratories and hobbyists. [...] They are also useful as a teaching aid as the user is more directly exposed to basic line phenomena than with more sophisticated instruments.|$|E
40|$|A Sucrose <b>Analyser,</b> {{developed}} by the Sugar Research Institute in Australia, was made available for evaluation in the South African sugar industry. The <b>analyser</b> was installed in line on evaporator syrup, at a raw sugar factory.

40|$|A fast four channel network <b>analyser</b> is {{introduced}} to measure S-parameters in a frequency range from 10 MHz to 4 GHz. The measurement period {{of this kind}} of network <b>analyser</b> is short in comparison with a conventional one, which becomes possible by using highly linear analogue frequency ramps, realized with fractional divider phase locked loop circuits. The settling time for the discrete frequency points, which is typical for a conventional network <b>analyser,</b> is nearly eliminated by the use of frequency ramps. To achieve the necessary bandwidth of 4 GHz in the baseband, a heterodyne principle is applied. A VCO-signal from 5 to 9 GHz is down converted to the baseband with a fixed frequency generator of 9 GHz. The structure of the following network <b>analyser</b> is similar to the structure of a conventional four channel network <b>analyser</b> and therefore all known calibration techniques are suited for the fast network <b>analyser.</b> The intermediate frequency, which is necessary for the evaluation, carries the required information. However a special analysis technique is necessary. This technique is based on two Fourier transformations...|$|R

In order to properly account for this non-linear effect, the Norden used a system of slip-disks similar to those used in differential <b>analysers.</b> However, this slow change at long distances made it difficult to fine-tune the drift early in the bomb run. In practice, bombardiers would often set up their ground speed measurements in advance of approaching the target area by selecting a convenient [...] "target" [...] on the ground that was closer to the bomber and thus had more obvious motion in the sight.
