Remembering the challenges he faced as a youth, Bosh founded the organization to help younger people in academics and athletics. The Foundation, with programs in Toronto and Dallas, has worked closely with {{organizations such as the}} Toronto Special Olympics to raise important funding for community projects. Bosh's mother, Freida, has served as CEO of the Foundation. As an avid reader, Bosh also regularly speaks to groups of children <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> reading, and has received the NBA Community Assist Award for his active contributions for the Raptors community development program in Toronto and Dallas {{during the course of the}} NBA campaign. In November 2008, Bosh pledged to donate $75,000 to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada. He is also an advocate for increased computer literacy in schools, supporting the non-profit code.org.|$|E
5|$|Some researchers, {{as well as}} some timber {{companies}} and private citizens, understood that fire was a natural state of affairs in many ecosystems. Fire would help clean out the understory and dead plant matter, allowing economically important tree species to grow with less competition for nutrients. Native Americans would often burn woodlands to reduce overgrowth and increase grasslands for large prey animals such as bison and elk. As early as 1924, environmentalist Aldo Leopold argued that wildfires were beneficial to ecosystems, and were necessary for the natural propagation of numerous tree and plant species. Over the next 40 years, increasing numbers of foresters and ecologists concurred <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> wildfire to ecosystems. In 1963, a group of ecologists consulted by the National Park Service released a report recommending that wildfires should be allowed to periodically burn to restore the environmental balance in parks. The Wilderness Act of 1964 helped to address the role of fire as a natural part of ecosystems. By 1968, the National Park Service had adjusted its fire management policies to reflect changing attitudes. The service determined that fires that started naturally (by lightning) would be permitted to burn if they posed little risk to human life and property. The service also decreed that under prescribed conditions, controlled burns would be deliberately set to restore balance to ecosystems. Fire ecology became better understood after many forests had aged to maturity and were overdue for a large scale burn.|$|E

25|$|The {{discussion}} of breastfeeding during early prenatal care can positively effect a woman's likelihood to breastfeed her child.

25|$|The {{promotion}} and advocacy of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> handwashing {{and lead to}} long-term behavior change of the population.

One example for handwashing promotion in schools is the “Three Star Approach” by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive {{steps to ensure that}} students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements. When minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one to ultimately three stars. Building hand washing stations can be a part of handwashing promotion campaigns that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and child mortality.|$|E

25|$|Regardless of {{the medium}} of introduction, {{biological}} invasions have a considerable effect on the landscape. The goal of eliminating invasive species is not new; Plato wrote <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> biotic and landscape diversity centuries ago. However, the notion of eliminating invasive species is difficult to define {{because there is no}} canonical length of time that a species must exist in a specific environment until it is no longer classified as invasive. European forestry defines plants as being archaeotypes if they existed in Europe before 1500 and neophytes if they arrived after 1500. This classification is still arbitrary and some species have unknown origins while others have become such key components of their landscape that they are best understood as keystone species. As a result, their removal would have an enormous impact on the landscape, but not necessarily cause a return to conditions that existed before the invasion.|$|E
25|$|Churchill was {{appointed}} Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1924 under Stanley Baldwin and oversaw Britain's disastrous {{return to the}} gold standard, which resulted in deflation, unemployment, and the miners' strike {{that led to the}} General Strike of 1926. His decision, announced in the 1924 budget, came after long consultation with treasury officials, various economists, and the board of the Bank of England. Churchill was sceptical <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> returning to the gold standard, and widely questioned the almost unanimous advice he was receiving that it was necessary. The governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, said that 'there was no alternative to a return to gold'. The permanent secretary to the treasury, Sir Otto Niemeyer said that not to do so would show Britain had never 'meant business' about the gold standard, and that 'our nerve had failed'. The parliamentary joint select committee on Currency and Banking under its chairman Lord Bradbury (former permanent secretary to the treasury) supported a return, as did the Labour shadow chancellor, Snowden.|$|E

If a rail project were to be approved, the system would be running in 7–10 years. On February 28, 2013, {{it was announced that}} a group consisting of representatives from the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, planners from the City of Buffalo, the Buffalo Sabres and NFTA are working on a plan to extend the southern terminus of the rail line just beyond the NFTA rail yard at the DL Terminal to a new parking garage being built near the Medical Campus. Without extended branches in the suburbs, the truncated system serves an average of 13,900 passengers daily as of 2014. As a useful transportation asset, Buffalo Metro Rail is ranked 25th in the nation in light rail daily ridership service as of 2013, with 5,058,300 passengers. One group, the Citizens Regional Transit Corporation (CRTC), advocates for expansion. As indicated in its statement, the CRTC seeks to educate the public, public officials, their authorities and agencies in the Buffalo-Niagara region <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> a comprehensive transportation system including an expanded Metro Rail. In April 2011, the group stated that the 600 block of Main Street, which has Shea's Performing Arts Center along with hotels and bars, should be converted into a mixed automobile and rail system. The 600 block was re-opened to traffic in 2015.|$|E
