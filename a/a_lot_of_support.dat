5|$|Another project {{combining}} the T-34 tank chassis with the D-15 gun was also considered. Designated SU-D15, the medium assault gun {{was intended as}} a replacement for the SU-122. Although the project received <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from the authorities it never entered production, both because of its shortcomings (the heavy gun put too much strain on the suspension and ammunition stowage was too limited) and because it was made redundant by the ISU-152. However lessons learned mounting a powerful gun in the T-34 allowed for rapid development of the SU-100 tank destroyer.|$|E

She went on to graduate from a college and a university. She received a diploma in Wife Assault and Child Advocacy from George Brown College and graduated with honours. To remove the burns her pimp had inflicted on her, she had laser surgery that cost thousands of dollars.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, the River Aire was navigable to Knottingley, and boats {{carrying}} up to 30tons {{traded on the}} river, which was tidal up to this point. The traders of Leeds were keen to have a navigable link to the town, to make easier the export of woollen cloth, but bills presented to Parliament in 1621 and 1625 had failed. William Pickering, who was mayor of Leeds, had made further attempts to obtain an act of Parliament for improvements to the river in 1679, again without success. As the 1600s drew to a close, a number of bills were passed for other rivers, and there was general support for river navigations. A bill was drawn up in 1698, with support from wool traders in Leeds and general merchants in Wakefield. John Hadley surveyed the Aire, and Samuel Shelton surveyed the Calder. Although the bill had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> it was opposed by the City of York, who feared that the River Ouse would be damaged by the scheme.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} 68000 (introduced in 1979) had a 24-bit {{address bus}} and a 16-bit data bus.

25|$|The {{industry}} {{has continued to}} decline although has remained throughout the postwar years. This has been a result of lack of demand combined with foreign competition. In 1965, 8,000 people were employed in 900 firms but by 1985, this had reduced to 4,000 people in 600 firms. The average life of a firm in the 1980s was 2.8 years which meant that the leasing of space in flatted factories was impractical.

Truth be told, the maecenate was rather thrifty, it profited from {{the needs of the}} debuting and impoverished artist. But without it things would've been much worse, since others did not even offer as much". He also argued that, contrary to speculation about his wealth, Bogdan-Pitești [...] "maybe paid up so little because that is all he had to spare".

500|$|Luton Town {{have been}} looking for a new ground since 1955, when club {{chairman}} Percy Mitchell spoke of building a stadium [...] "to hold 35,000 in comfort... get <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> which goes to London at the moment". However, due to unstable finances and an inability to find a site, no ground was built. The club proposed a move to Milton Keynes in 1982—according to The Luton News, to play as [...] "MK Hatters" [...] in a [...] "super-stadium"—but this was prevented by vehement protests in Luton, where supporters against such a move marched through the town to display their feelings. Despite consistent fan opposition to the idea, relocation up the M1 motorway to the new town was raised several more times over the next two decades; for example, The Football League refused Luton permission to move to Milton Keynes in 2000, saying that a member club was not allowed to leave its home town. Wimbledon F.C. was granted permission to relocate there in 2002, did so a year later and became Milton Keynes Dons in 2004.|$|E
500|$|According to Bradman, Morris' {{success was}} due to his {{powerful}} wrists and forearms. Bradman interpreted Morris' unorthodox methods—he often defended with his bat not straight—as a sign of genius. Ian Johnson believed that Morris' idiosyncratic technique was a strength, as it disrupted any plans made by the opposition. Contrary to the accepted wisdom of the day, Morris had a penchant for lofting his drives, backing his ability to clear the infield. Benaud rated Morris alongside Neil Harvey as having the best footwork against spin bowling among batsmen after the Second World War. Morris was particularly known for his fast analysis {{of the length of}} the ball, and as a result, he quickly and decisively moved forward or back. Morris' productivity declined {{in the latter half of}} his career, something he put down to the break-up of his opening pairing with Barnes. Morris' partnerships with his later partners yielded less runs, leading him to remark that [...] "When Siddy [...] went, I lost <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> because he'd always get ones." [...] Morris was also known for his unselfishness, often sacrificing his wicket after being involved in mix-ups while running between wickets, and he had a reputation for not attempting to finish not out to inflate his average.|$|E
500|$|Limbo was {{released}} on 21 July 2010 on the Xbox Live Arcade service, as the first title in the yearly [...] "Summer of Arcade" [...] promotion. Although the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) had listed entries for Limbo for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows platforms, Playdead confirmed {{that this was a}} mistake on ESRB's part, and that they had no plans for the game on these systems. Patti later clarified that they had planned on Windows and PlayStation 3 versions alongside the Xbox 360 version initially, but after reviewing their options, decided to go with Xbox 360 exclusivity, in part that [...] "Microsoft provided us with an excellent opportunity, which included <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the title which in the end would mean a better visibility for Limbo". According to producer Mads Wibroe, part of their decision not to release for the Windows platform was to avoid issues with software piracy, something they could control on the Xbox 360. Patti stated that staying exclusive with the Xbox platform was an assurance that {{they would be able to}} recoup their investment in the game's development. Sony Computer Entertainment executive Pete Smith stated later that while they had tried to vie with Microsoft for exclusivity for Limbo, Playdead refused to relinquish its intellectual property to Sony as part of the deal. Patti affirmed that Limbo would not be released for another console, but that their next game, already in development as of October 2010, may see wider release.|$|E
