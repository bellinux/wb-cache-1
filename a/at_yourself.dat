5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun <b>at</b> <b>yourself,</b> I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

500|$|Six {{years after}} {{cancellation}} of Police Squad!, the film [...] returned Nielsen to {{his role as}} Frank Drebin. It involved a ruthless drug king trying hypnosis to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. Nielsen did many of his own stunts: [...] "You {{have an idea of}} how you're going to do something, and it's your vision... unless you do it, it really doesn't stand a chance." [...] This movie grossed over $78million and was well received by critics. Ebert's 3½–star review (out of four) noted, [...] "You laugh, and then you laugh <b>at</b> <b>yourself</b> for laughing." ...|$|E

500|$|After the {{separation}} Koechlin discussed her struggles {{in an interview}} with Daily News and Analysis, [...] "Even as an actor, you have days when you haven't slept enough, you don't feel like you're good enough or pretty enough... But ultimately, it's all about attitude. You must live with a little abandon and not be self-conscious. You ought to stop staring <b>at</b> <b>yourself</b> in the mirror, and just smile a little!" [...] Having suffered through racial prejudice in her teenage years and early film career, when she was stereotyped as a 'white-girl' in India, Koechlin advocates for an anti-racist ideology. She acknowledged her share of confusion, regarding her identity as a [...] "white-skinned woman growing up in Tamil Nadu", who had to defend her [...] "Indian-ness" [...] at numerous occasions. Later in 2012, she said of herself, “My skin is white, but my heart is brown.” ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bad" [...] was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} duet between Jackson and musician Prince. Other artists {{that were supposed to}} be featured on the album included Diana Ross, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin and Barbra Streisand, but none of those collaborations ended up happening. The song was viewed as a revived [...] "Hit the Road, Jack" [...] progression with lyrics that pertain to 'boasting'. [...] "Dirty Diana" [...] was viewed by AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine as [...] "misogynistic" [...] and its lyrics, describing a sexual predator, do not aim for the [...] "darkness" [...] of [...] "Billie Jean", instead sounding equally intrigued by and apprehensive of a sexual challenge, while having the opportunity to accept or resist it. [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] was described as being a [...] "paranoid anthem". [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] was seen as Jackson going [...] "a step further" [...] and offering [...] "a straightforward homily of personal commitment", which {{can be seen in the}} lyrics, [...] "I'm starting with the man in the mirror/I'm asking him to change his ways/And no message could have been any clearer/If you wanna make the world a better place/Take a look <b>at</b> <b>yourself</b> and then make a change." [...] The lyrics to [...] "Speed Demon" [...] are about driving fast.|$|E
500|$|During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans {{from the}} low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone {{to that of a}} [...] "child whisperer" [...] due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it [...] "a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an {{identity}} crisis". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including [...] "When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look <b>at</b> <b>yourself</b> in the mirror / That's your way home". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing [...] "Shine!" [...] and Williams screaming [...] "Hey!". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, [...] "So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation" [...] and [...] "that bear with the red hat", as obvious references to Paddington. According to Sannwald, the lyrics include [...] "Pharrell's 'Happy"-ish 'Everybody is the same inside' bridge" [...] that allows the song to appeal to both children and their parents [...] "without sounding overly patronizing". [...] "Shine" [...] ends with Williams singing in the falsetto register.|$|E

500|$|After the 2009 {{extension}} of the tour was announced, some changes {{were made to the}} setlist. [...] "Candy Shop" [...] had a new video backdrop by artist Marilyn Minter, featuring imagery of a giant tongue licking and spitting out neon-colored icing. Madonna also wore new opening outfit designed by Riccardo Tisci. [...] "Heartbeat" [...] was replaced by [...] "Holiday" [...] and incorporated elements of her then latest single [...] "Celebration", and her first single [...] "Everybody". After Michael Jackson's death, it was modified to include a medley of three Michael Jackson songs, as an homage to the recently deceased singer. The performance featured Madonna's dancer Kento, who danced in similar clothing and dancing style as Jackson. Madonna's 1985 single [...] "Dress You Up" [...] replaced the rock version of [...] "Borderline". It featured elements of rock songs like [...] "My Sharona" [...] by The Knack and [...] "God Save The Queen" [...] by Sex Pistols. [...] "Hung Up" [...] was removed and replaced by an up-beat version of [...] "Frozen" [...] with interpolations from [...] "Open Your Heart", which was set between [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". The video backdrop for [...] "Frozen" [...] used video outtakes from the song's music video, directed by Chris Cunningham. [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was also slightly edited for selected performances with the lyrics from Michael Jackson's song [...] "Man in the Mirror, [...] "If you wanna {{make the world a better}} place... Take a look <b>at</b> <b>yourself,</b> and then make a change" [...] appearing on the screens before the beginning of the song.|$|E
2500|$|When the Grand Duke {{arranged}} {{a change of}} class into the gentry for his mistress and the couple's illegitimate children, Alexandra Petrovna appealed to Alexander II to intervene, but she found her brother-in-law less than sympathetic. [...] "You see," [...] he bluntly told her, [...] "your husband is {{in the prime of}} his life, and he needs a woman with whom he can be in love. And look <b>at</b> <b>yourself!</b> See even how you dress! No man would be attracted". After this encounter, however, Alexander did advise his brother to be more discreet and exiled Catherine Chislova to Wenden, near Riga in 1875. Grand Duke Nicholas managed to have Chislova returned and had her installed with their illegitimate children in the Crimea.|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] led CBS Records to renew Jones' {{recording}} contract and sparked {{new interest in}} the singer. He {{was the subject of}} an hour-and-a-quarter-long HBO television special entitled George Jones: With a Little Help from His Friends, which saw him performing songs with Waylon Jennings, Elvis Costello, Tanya Tucker, and Tammy Wynette, among others. Jones continued drinking and using cocaine, appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] arguably inebriated, like when he performed [...] "I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool" [...] with Barbara Mandrell at the 1981 Country Music Association Awards. [...] He was involved in several high-speed car chases with police, which were reported on the national news, and one arrest was filmed by a local TV crew; the video, which is widely available online, offers a glimpse into Jones' alter ego when drinking, as he argues with the police officer and lunges at the camera man. Conversely, when sober, Jones was known to be friendly and down to earth, even shy. [...] In a 1994 article on Jones, Nick Tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in April 1976, [...] "One could readily believe the accounts by those who had known him for years: that he had not changed much at all and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune." [...] In an unusually unguarded self-appraisal in 1981, the singer told Mark Rose of The Village Voice, [...] "I don't show a lot of affection. [...] I have probably been a very unliked person among family, like somebody who was heartless. [...] I saved it all for the songs. [...] I didn't know you were supposed to show that love person to person. [...] I guess I always wanted to, but I didn't know how. [...] The only way I could would be {{to do it in a}} song." [...] Years later he commented to The Christian Broadcasting Network's Scott Ross about himself, [...] "I think you're mad <b>at</b> <b>yourself,</b> I think that you're sayin' to yourself 'You don't deserve this. [...] You don't deserve those fans. [...] You don't deserve makin' this money.' [...] And you're mad <b>at</b> <b>yourself.</b> [...] And you beat up on yourself by drinkin' and losing friends that won't put up with that...It's just one terrible big mess you make out of your life." [...] In 1982, Jones recorded the album A Taste of Yesterday's Wine with Merle Haggard; [...] while Jones, in the wake of his condition, appeared underweight on the album cover, his singing was flawless. [...] His run of hits also continued in the early 1980s, with the singer charting [...] "I'm Not Ready Yet", [...] "Same Ole Me" [...] (backed by the Oak Ridge Boys)", [...] "Still Doin' Time", [...] "Tennessee Whiskey", [...] "We Didn't See a Thing" [...] (a duet with Ray Charles), and [...] "I Always Get Lucky with You", which was Jones' last number one in 1984.|$|E

2500|$|... "Everything to Me", the album's fourth {{track and}} {{official}} first single, reunited Monica with producer Missy Elliott {{and saw the}} pair basically reprising the formula of previous successes such as [...] "So Gone" [...] (2003) and [...] "A Dozen Roses (You Remind Me)" [...] (2006). A musical ode to all things good in life, written by singer Jazmine Sullivan, the retro ballad contains a prominent sample of the Deniece Williams' 1981 recording [...] "Silly." [...] Released to rave reviews among critics, who noted it the album's [...] "standout track — as solid as a brick house; great singing, great lyrics, great production, just a great all-around song," [...] "Everything to Me" [...] became the singer's most-successful release in years. Elliott also contributed [...] "If You Were My Man", {{one of the few}} up tempo songs on Still Standing, which Monica described as the song, who was most out of her character. Originally titled [...] "Betcha", the track samples Evelyn [...] "Champagne" [...] King's 1982 record [...] "Betcha She Don't Love You", featuring heavy elements of 1980's music, and garnered a mixed response by critics, whose reviews of the song alternated between [...] "blemish," [...] "brainless," [...] and [...] "funky". [...] "Mirror", the sixth track produced by Jim Jonsin, was recorded late into the production of the album. A song about self-acceptance, Monica noted the composition one of her personal standouts on the album: [...] "Its basically about being able to look <b>at</b> <b>yourself</b> in the mirror and be completely happy with the person that you are," [...] she said. [...] "Having no shame or feeling pain again, and I am at that place in my life." ...|$|E
