[...] Black Eye was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by punk rock veteran Bill Price, who had recorded albums by Sex Pistols and The Clash. The album was recorded live {{in the studio and}} the music was not arranged by the producer in order to achieve a rough, live sound. According to Rootes, Price [...] "just recorded us live while we were playing.

English hip hop producer Metabeats called Songs of Experience {{one of his}} favorite sources for sampling music and said of the album in an interview for Hip Hop Connection: [...] "You could sample everything on this record, and I think everyone already has. Axelrod is pretty much a sound library in himself – the quality is amazing."

[...] Anderson has since said that the first album was about [...] "sex and depression in equal measure". All the latter-day lyrics for the first album were directly influenced by extremely personal and emotional experiences in Anderson's life. [...] "So Young", featuring a piano bridge courtesy of Ed Buller, was about his girlfriend's overdose. Anderson says: [...] "it deals with the knife-edge of being young." [...] "The Next Life", which was Butler's first serious piano part, was a lament to his deceased mother, while [...] "Breakdown" [...] dealt with his schoolfriend's descent into extreme depression.

5000|$|As 2007 approached, Franklin held little {{optimism}} for a Swervedriver reunion, but by {{the middle}} of that year he had changed his outlook, referring positively to the successful 2004 reunion of the Pixies during an interview promoting his first release as a solo artist. The band members finally got together with serious intentions in early October 2007 after the idea resurfaced in a phone conversation between Franklin and Hartridge. They soon made it official—on 19 October 2007, it was announced that Swervedriver would reunite for a 2008 international tour. Hindmarsh confirmed the news on the band's discussion forum the following day: [...] "Yep - it's true. Your enthusiasm & passion for the band over these past years has been truly awe-inspiring. Humbling in fact." [...] Franklin released the following statement on 6 November 2007 about the band getting back together: So it looks like Swervedriver will hit the road once more. It all happened quite quickly and we met up in a pub in London last month and figured out what we'd like to do, which at this point is just heading out and playing some shows again.As far as new recordings are concerned, I already have two albums to record next year (a new 'solo' and Morning debut) and they take priority. Maybe the Swervies can rustle up a new tune or two but really, there's more than enough going on with that back catalogue already.I gotta say that something that really sparked my interest in this was hearing the live version of [...] "Sandblasted" [...] that has been posted for some time at swervedriver.com and subsequently at the MySpace page. I'd just never heard it played <b>like</b> <b>that</b> before.

500|$|Construction of the {{monument}} began in 1848 with the excavation of the site, the laying of the cornerstone on the prepared bed, and laying the original foundation around {{and on top of}} the cornerstone, before the construction of its massive walls began the next year. Even though slave labor is not mentioned, no paid laborers whatsoever are listed among the small paid labor force of 21 used to construct the foundation in 1848, which included 14 stonemasons and 2 stonecutters. In contrast, the maximum work force during the second phase was 170, including 100 stonecutters, with laborers second in number. Washington Monument Historian John Steele Gordon stated [...] "I can’t say for certain, but the stonemasonry was pretty highly skilled, so it’s unlikely that slaves would’ve been doing it. The stones were cut by stonecutters, which is highly skilled work; and the stones were hoisted by means of steam engines, so you’d need a skilled engineer <b>and</b> foreman for <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Tending the steam engine, building the cast-iron staircase inside — that wasn’t grunt work." [...] According to historian Jesse Holland, it is very likely that African-American slaves were among the construction workers, given that slavery prevailed in Washington and its surrounding states at that time, and slaves were commonly used in public and private construction.|$|R
5000|$|Musically, Stars Dance is {{an album}} rooted stylistically in EDM and pop, this later {{specifically}} showcased as electropop while also containing strong elements of dubstep, techno, disco and worldbeat. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News described {{the music on}} Stars Dance as [...] "dance-song-heavy" [...] dubstep, that contains [...] "wobbly synths, loopy vocals, fist-pumping beats and crunchy breakdowns". The album contains a highly diverse musical composition, highlighted by Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian as [...] "darting efficiently from EDM to Bollywood". The majority of the album contains dubstep breakdowns, requisite stabs of synths, and according to Jim Farber of New York Daily News, [...] "features a frisson of sex previously absent from this good-girl singer's work." [...] Jason Evigan said of the album's musical style, [...] "She's got some really cool like ethnic influence, kind of tribally dance drums <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> that", stating <b>that</b> it was similar to music by Jennifer Lopez. August Brown of the Los Angeles Times called Stars Dance a [...] "sassy" [...] pop-EDM album, noting its composition included [...] "oxygen-sucking" [...] sub-bass, trap snares. Brown noted the influence of Spring Breakers on the album, saying that Gomez wasn't ready to leave the [...] "neon-splattered emotional hellscape of Spring Breakers just yet". He further went on to say: [...] "Stars Dance {{is exactly the kind}} of album one makes in 2013 if you want to keep the pop sugar of the Disney tween cabal but mix in some broken glass and a club bathroom nosebleed. Its productions are rooted in today's pop-EDM default mode, but as that stuff goes, 'Slow Down' is pretty capable, and the bhangra-appropriating 'Come & Get It' is guilelessly silly enough to work." ...|$|R
