25|$|The French {{privateer}} Louis-Michel Aury {{used the}} Argentine flag {{as a model}} for the blue-white-blue flag of the first independent state in Central America, which was created 1818 in Isla de Providencia, an island off the east coast of Nicaragua. This state existed until approximately 1821, before the Gran Colombia took over control of these islands. Somewhat later (1823) this flag was again used as the model for the flag of the United Provinces of Central America, a confederation of the current Central American states of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, which existed from 1823 to 1838. After the dissolution of the Union, the five countries became independent, but even today all of these states except Costa Rica use flags of blue-white-blue stripes (the Costa Rican flag has a red stripe superimposed on the white one, added to incorporate <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> of the French flag). The Argentine flag also inspired the flags of Uruguay and Paraguay.|$|E

500|$|Levinson said he {{considered}} the interrogation scene in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] between Braugher, Secor and Chaplin, to be the [...] "defining scene" [...] for Frank Pembleton's character because it defined the character's intelligence, quirkiness, sharp instincts and sneaky interrogation style. While filming that scene, Levinson commented to Tom Fontana that the acting was so effective, an entire episode could be filmed revolving strictly around an interrogation. The comments partially inspired Fontana to write the first-season episode, [...] "Three Men and Adena", which {{became one of the}} most critically acclaimed Homicide episodes. The final scene of the episode features Bayliss responding to the murder scene of Adena Watson in a rainy alleyway. The body was wrapped in a red raincoat, and Levinson worked with colorists to bleed out <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> except that red to give the film a stark look. [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] originally included a scene with Gee and Bayliss discussing detective work at the police station. The scene, which was cut from the final episode, featured Gee comparing the work to challenges faced by literary character Sherlock Holmes, as well as Gee mistakenly referring to Holmes' antagonist Moriarty as [...] "Murray".|$|E
500|$|Multi-color {{cards were}} {{introduced}} in the [...] set and typically use a gold frame to distinguish them from mono-color cards. These cards require mana from two or more different colors to be played and count as belonging {{to each of the}} colors used to play them. Multi-color cards typically combine the philosophy and mechanics of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> used in the spell's cost, and tend to be proportionally more powerful compared to single-color or hybrid cards, as requiring multiple colors of mana makes them harder to cast. More recently, two-color [...] "hybrid" [...] cards {{were introduced in}} the [...] set, and appeared extensively throughout the Shadowmoor and [...] sets. Hybrid cards are distinguished by a gradient frame with those two colors, and can be paid with either of the card's colors; for instance, a card with two hybrid-red/white icons can be cast using two red mana, two white mana, or one of each. Several sets have made multi-colored cards a theme, including Invasion, Shards of Alara, both Ravnica blocks and others. Core sets do not typically include multi-color cards in them, although the Core 2013 set was the first to do so.|$|E
