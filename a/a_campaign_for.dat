5|$|In December 1954, 162 Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested, 95 were court martialed, and 91 {{were found}} guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 1 to 18 years of hard labor.

In reaction to his Keating Five experience, he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns. He was also a leader in normalizing diplomatic relations with Vietnam.

5|$|After {{being told}} that nobody {{was going to be}} charged with Leigh's sexual assault, in 1990 Leigh's mother began <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> the case to be officially re-investigated. In August 1994, Kerry Carrington sent a 17,000-word {{document}} and 300 pages of evidence to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, asking for the case to be investigated. The commission was headed by Judge James Roland Wood, though a representative for the commission stated that Wood's involvement in Webster's trial would not affect the outcome of any investigation. In December 1994, a representative for the commission said that after thorough consideration, they would not be investigating the matter.|$|E

The Wales National Ice Rink was earmarked for demolition and <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> the council to provide a new facility proved successful. With both clubs confirming their intent to take part the following season, speculation began about the possible inclusion of a tenth team to replace London Racers. After the season was over, rumours about the possible admission of either Hull or Dundee became more and more widespread. On 22 June 2006, Hull Stingrays were formally elected into the Elite Ice Hockey League as the tenth active member.|$|E

5|$|Khan's {{selection}} {{as a candidate}} was {{seen as part of}} a wider move towards the left in Labour that emerged during the 2015 leadership election that followed Miliband's resignation. Key policies that Khan proposed included a London 'living rent'; a quota system for ethnic minority officers in the Metropolitan Police; increased home building; and <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> a London Living Wage. Commentators raised Khan's Muslim religion as a potential barrier to election, after a poll (not mentioning Khan by name) suggested that 31% of Londoners would be 'uncomfortable' with a Muslim mayor. Khan, who was London's first Muslim MP, argued that the election of a Muslim could encourage London to become recognised as a more cosmopolitan city. While Khan had stated that he would serve a full term as MP for Tooting if he were to become Mayor of London, he later announced that would stand down as MP for Tooting if he were elected Mayor.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Humphrey's run, President Lyndon Johnson began <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> re-election, {{entering}} {{his name in}} the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary for March 1968. Late in 1967, building upon anti-war sentiment, Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota entered the race with heavy criticism of the President's Vietnam War policies. Even before McCarthy's entrance, Johnson grew concerned about a challenge. He confided to Democratic Congressional leaders that an opponent could pull the support of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Dr. Benjamin Spock, defeating him in New Hampshire, and forcing his withdrawal from the race; similar to Senator Estes Kefauver's 1952 challenge to President Harry Truman, which likely caused Truman not to seek re-election.|$|E

5|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} has been legal in Spain since 3 July 2005. In 2004, the nation's newly elected Socialist Party (PSOE) Government, led by Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, began <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> its legalization, {{including the right}} of adoption by same-sex couples. After much debate, a law permitting same-sex marriage {{was passed by the}} Cortes Generales (Spain's bicameral Parliament, composed of the Senate and the Congress of Deputies) on 30 June 2005 and published on 2 July 2005. The law took effect the next day, making Spain the third country in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry across the entire country, after the Netherlands and Belgium, and 17 days ahead of the right being extended across all of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} has been legally recognized in Maryland since January 1, 2013. In 2012, the state's Democratic representatives, led by Governor Martin O'Malley, began <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> its legalization. After much debate, a law permitting same-sex marriage {{was passed by}} the General Assembly (Maryland's bicameral legislature, composed of the Senate and House of Delegates) in February 2012 and signed on March 1, 2012. The law took effect on January 1, 2013 after 52.4% of voters approved a statewide referendum held on November 6, 2012. The vote was hailed as a watershed moment by gay rights activists and marked the first time marriage rights in the United States have been extended to same-sex couples by popular vote.|$|E
5|$|Taper was not Levin's {{only work}} for The Spectator. He wrote {{on a wide}} range of subjects, from <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> the release of three Arabs imprisoned by the British authorities, to {{supporting}} publication of the banned novel Lady Chatterley's Lover, and denunciation of the retired Lord Chief Justice, Lord Goddard. The last led to a secret meeting of more than 20 senior judges to see whether Levin could be prosecuted for criminal libel; there was no prosecution, and his accusations about Goddard's vindictiveness, deceit and bias have relatively recently been claimed to have been justified. In 1959, Gilmour, while remaining as proprietor, stepped down as editor and was succeeded by his deputy, Brian Inglis; Levin took over from Inglis as assistant editor. Later in that year, after the general election victory of another of his bêtes noires, Harold Macmillan, Levin gave up the Taper column, professing himself to be in despair.|$|E

A garden of remembrance was built in Abington Square, {{the location of the}} original temporary cenotaph, and unveiled by Major General Sir John Brown in 1937; the names of the fallen were inscribed on the garden walls. The memorial to Edgar Mobbs—a professional rugby player from Northampton who was killed in the First World War in 1917—was moved into the garden.|$|E
5|$|The {{breakdown}} of the 65th resulted {{from a number of}} factors: a shortage of officers and non-commissioned officers, a rotation policy that removed combat-experienced leaders and soldiers, tactical doctrine that led to high casualties, a shortage of artillery ammunition, communication problems between largely white, English-speaking officers and Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican enlisted men, and declining morale. The report also found bias in the prosecution of the Puerto Ricans, citing instances of Continental soldiers who were not charged after refusing to fight in similar circumstances, before and after Jackson Heights. Though the men who were court martialed were pardoned, <b>a</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>for</b> a formal exoneration was launched.|$|E
