25|$|As an {{interceptor}} the Thunderceptor {{was soon}} eclipsed by designs from other companies, {{but like the}} Thunderceptor none of these would go into production. The United States Air Force decided to wait the short time needed to introduce newer and much more capable designs created {{as a part of}} the 1954 interceptor project. The Thunderceptor, like the other interceptor designs of the era, had extremely short flight times on the order of 25 minutes, making them almost useless for protecting an area as large as the United States. The 1954 designs outperformed the XF-91 in speed, range, and loiter time, as well as including the radar and fire-control systems needed for night and <b>all-weather</b> <b>operation.</b> The era of the dedicated day fighter-type interceptor was over.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, the French Army were {{interested}} in mounting an airborne battlefield surveillance radar upon the Super Puma. The first prototype Orchidée was assembled at Aerospatiale's Marignane factory and began testing in late 1988; the French Army intended to procure 20 aircraft to equip two squadrons. Orchidée was described as having a pulse-Doppler radar mounted on the fuselage's underside, being capable of 360-degree scanning to detect low flying helicopters and ground vehicles at ranges of up to 150km; gathered data was to be relayed in real time to mobile ground stations via a single-channel data link for processing and analysis before being transmitted to battlefield commanders. The system {{was said to be}} capable of <b>all-weather</b> <b>operation,</b> and would feature protection against counteracting hostile electronic countermeasures. However, development was aborted in mid-1990 during post-Cold War defence spending reductions.|$|E
500|$|Bulldozers carved Schwimmer Drome {{out of the}} jungle. Only a {{few feet}} above the normal level of the Laloki River, it was {{susceptible}} to periodic flooding. The base material used for the [...] runway was laid over alluvial sand and gravel, and Marston Mat used for the surface. The resulting runway was [...] not capable of <b>all-weather</b> <b>operation,</b> so a second runway was constructed parallel to the first. This time gravel dredged from the Laloki River {{was used as a}} base. It was spread while wet and then rolled to form a firm base. Marston Mat was removed from the original to provide a surface for the new [...] all-weather [...] runway, which was ready for use in November 1942. A low trestle bridge over the Laloki River provided access. It was understood that the bridge might be washed away by floods, so pontoon equipment was provided for this eventuality. This was needed; a downpour on 21 October swept away the bridge, and rendered Three Mile, Seven Mile and Thirty Mile non-operational. The bridge was replaced by a high steel structure.|$|E

50|$|The {{engineers}} {{opened an}} entirely new airfield in North Africa every other day for seven straight months. Once when heavy rains along the coast reduced the capacity of old airfields, two companies of Airborne Engineers loaded miniaturized gear into 56 transports, flew a thousand miles to a dry Sahara location, started blasting away, and were ready for the first B-17 24 hours later. Often engineers had to repair and use a captured enemy airfield. The German fields were well-built <b>all-weather</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 2011, a military-configured variant, the AW139M, was {{revealed}} by AgustaWestland. It was promoted at the US market, including for the U.S. Air Force's Common Vertical Lift Support Program. The AW139M {{is equipped with}} a high definition forward-looking infrared (FLIR), self-protection system, heavy-duty landing gear, and has low thermal and acoustic signatures; a significant proportion of the equipment is sourced from American manufacturers. Options offered include an external stores system including various armaments, armored seats, self-sealing fuel tanks, and a full ice-protection system for <b>all-weather</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first-generation jet {{aircraft}} assigned to AAC were F-80 Shooting Stars which arrived in 1948. The jets {{had a much}} faster rate of climb than their World War II propeller-driven predecessors, but lacked radar to find the bombers it was being used to intercept. However, it served its purpose by introducing AAC to the jet age. Its successor, the F-94 Starfire in 1951 was essentially an upgraded F-80 with a radar operator and was better equipped for <b>all-weather</b> <b>operations.</b> It also was afterburner-equipped for higher interceptor speeds.|$|R
50|$|The Aeryon Scout is a man-packable quadcopter UAV {{designed}} for aerial reconnaissance by users with minimal training. Weighing just 1.3 kg, it features onboard intelligence, all-digital communications and a map-based touch-screen control which enables new users {{to operate the}} vehicles with only minutes of training. This map-based control allows the system to be easily controlled beyond line-of-sight and at night, a unique feature of this system. Its unique modular design allows for quick-connect payloads of different types and its arms and legs are changeable in the field, with no tools. This allows the user to repair damages easily and return to operation quickly. The Scout is approximately 0.8 m from propeller tip to tip and operates using four brushless DC motors, making it very quiet. It has an endurance of approximately 20 minutes. It is capable of flying in winds up to 50 km/h and {{designed for}} <b>all-weather</b> <b>operation,</b> with an industrial temperature range. It has a payload capability of approximately 250 grams. It has been designed for both military and civilian use, with specific focus to remain dual-use compliant.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2015, Boeing {{unveiled}} {{a modified version}} of the RGM-84 it called the Harpoon Next Generation. It increases the ship-launched Harpoon missile's range from the Block II's [...] to , along with a new lighter 300 lb warhead and a more fuel-efficient engine with electronic fuel controls. Boeing offered the missile as the U.S. Navy's Littoral Combat Ship frigate upgrade over-the-horizon anti-ship missile as a cost-effective missile upgrade option; complete Next Gen Harpoons would cost approximately as much as a Block II at $1.2 million each, with upgrades for an existing missile costing half that. The version is also called the Harpoon Block II + ER. Boeing claims the Block II+ ER is superior to the Naval Strike Missile through its improved turbojet giving it greater range and active radar-homing seeker for <b>all-weather</b> <b>operation,</b> as well as a lighter but [...] "more lethal" [...] warhead. Test shots in 2017 had been confirmed. In May 2017, Boeing revealed it was no longer offering the upgraded Harpoon for the frigate OTH missile requirement, but would continue development of it.|$|E
50|$|A {{major change}} {{occurred}} in July 1971 which encompassed changing aircraft, location, and designation. The squadron was redesignated as the 71st Tactical Fighter Squadron {{and joined the}} Tactical Air Command with the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing at MacDill AFB, Florida. It was there that the 71st was equipped with the McDonnell F-4E Phantom II aircraft. During the time the squadron was at MacDill AFB it trained combat fighter crews in the complex F-4 weapon system for deployment to tactical units stationed worldwide. Graduates of the 71st bore {{the brunt of the}} battle and participated in the final operations against North Vietnam which terminated the war in Southeast Asia. While graduating over 370 fighter crew members from a complex and demanding combat training environment involving day, night, and <b>all-weather</b> <b>operation,</b> the 71st maintained the high standards of its heritage, receiving three consecutive Tactical Air Command Unit Achievement Awards for a record 4 years of accident-free flying through October 1974. In July 1975, the 71st transferred with the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing to Langley AFB, where it was equipped with the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle air superiority fighter.|$|E

2500|$|In late February 1945, as {{a result}} of the Western Allied {{invasion}} of Germany, United States Army forces moved though the Eifel area and captured the airfield about 1 March. On 8 March the IX Engineer Command 816th Engineer Aviation Battalion moved in and began to construct an operational airfield for Allied aircraft. The engineers laid down a 3600' Pierced Steel Planking runway aligned 15/33 on the former Luftwaffe field to support <b>all-weather</b> <b>operations</b> on the site.

50|$|A {{significant}} and recurring operational criticism of Sofia Airport has concerned its historical lack of <b>all-weather</b> <b>operations</b> capability. Though the new runway {{was designed for}} ICAO Category 3 operations, in 2007 it emerged that radio interference from security fencing, and most significantly from a large newly built lorry park, prevented certification (and hence use) of the associated radio navigational aids. During the winter months, the airport, located on a high alluvial plain surrounded by mountains, suffers from very {{significant and}} frequent fog precipitation. In such circumstances, flights are redirected to diversion airports in Bulgaria or neighbouring countries, lengthening journeys by many hours.|$|R

5000|$|At that time, Autoland {{had lower}} {{priority}} because efforts were concentrated on other projects including rapid landing of aircraft for RAF Fighter Command, visual aids for pilots, runway approach lighting and an approach aid using DME with Barbro. That changed when Operational Requirement 947 (OR947) for automatic {{landing on the}} V-Force bomber fleet was issued in 1954. [...] At that time the V-bomber force was the UK's main contribution to the strategic nuclear power of the west [...] and <b>all-weather</b> <b>operation</b> was essential. There was also renewed interest in automatic landing for civil aviation. As {{the next step in}} the development, the flare-out and coupling units from the Devon were linked to a Smiths Type D autopilot and installed in Varsity WF417, a much larger aircraft, capable of carrying 38 people rather than 10 in the Devon. The first fully automatic approach and landing was made by WF417 on 11 November 1954 under calm and misty conditions. [...] A similar system was installed in Canberra WE189 to provide the first application of Autoland to jet-type aircraft. [...] Automatic approaches [...] and automatic landings [...] were recorded by WE189 but the development was interrupted in April 1956 when the facilities at Woodbridge, which had the only suitable leader cable installation, ceased to be available to BLEU. Development of auto-flare and automatic kicking-off drift was continued at RAF Wittering, but in September that year WE189, returning from tests at Wittering, crashed due to engine failure on an approach when returning to its base at Martlesham Heath. The pilot, Flt. Lt. Les Coe, and the BLEU scientist in charge of the project, Mr. Joe Birkle, were killed.|$|E

The Flight Service Station at Leesburg was scheduled to close, but local lobbying convinced the FAA to rent space from the town and locate an AFSS at the airport. In 1993, when the airport fixed-base operator went bankrupt, the Town of Leesburg assumed direct operation of airport services, lengthening the runway twice to an eventual length of 5500 ft to support business jets and adding a localizer approach and automated weather observation equipment to support <b>all-weather</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|R

40|$|A fixed-based {{simulation}} {{experiment was}} conducted in NASA Langley Research Center s Integration Flight Deck simulator to investigate enabling technologies for equivalent visual operations (EVO) in the emerging Next Generation Air Transportation System operating environment. EVO implies the capability to achieve or even improve on the safety of current-day Visual Flight Rules (VFR) operations, maintain the operational tempos of VFR, and perhaps even retain VFR procedures - all independent of the actual weather and visibility conditions. Twenty-four air transport-rated pilots evaluated the use of Synthetic/Enhanced Vision Systems (S/EVS) and eXternal Vision Systems (XVS) technologies as enabling technologies for future <b>all-weather</b> <b>operations.</b> The experimental objectives were to determine the feasibility of XVS/SVS/EVS to provide for all weather (visibility) landing capability without the need (or ability) for a visual approach segment and to determine the interaction of XVS/EVS and peripheral vision cues for terminal area and surface operations. Another key element of the testing investigated the pilot's awareness and reaction to non-normal events (i. e., failure conditions) that were unexpectedly introduced into the experiment. These non-normal runs served as critical determinants in the underlying safety of <b>all-weather</b> <b>operations.</b> Experimental data from this test are cast into performance-based approach and landing standards which might establish a basis for future <b>all-weather</b> landing <b>operations.</b> Glideslope tracking performance appears to have improved with {{the elimination of the}} approach visual segment. This improvement can most likely be attributed {{to the fact that the}} pilots didn't have to simultaneously perform glideslope corrections and find required visual landing references in order to continue a landing. Lateral tracking performance was excellent regardless of the display concept being evaluated or whether or not there were peripheral cues in the side window. Although workload ratings were significantly less when peripheral cues were present compared to when there were none, these differences appear to be operationally inconsequential. Larger display concepts tested in this experiment showed significant situation awareness (SA) improvements and workload reductions compared to smaller display concepts. With a fixed display size, a color display was more influential in SA and workload ratings than a collimated display...|$|R
