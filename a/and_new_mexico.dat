5|$|Six states chose {{reptiles}} {{named after}} the state. In common names, Arizona and Texas were represented by the Arizona ridge-nosed rattlesnake and Texas horned lizard. Mississippi and North Carolina appeared in scientific names: Alligator mississippiensis and Terrapene carolina carolina. Alabama <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> appeared in both common names (Alabama red-bellied turtle <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> whiptail lizard) and scientific names (Pseudemys alabamensis and Cnemidophorus neomexicanus).|$|E

5|$|American Indians, largely Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota (Sioux), are {{predominant}} {{in several}} counties and comprise 20 per {{cent of the}} population in West River. The seven large Indian reservations in the state occupy an area much diminished from their former Great Sioux Reservation of West River, which the US government had once allocated to the Sioux tribes. South Dakota has the third-highest proportion of Native Americans of any state, behind Alaska <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{location}} of Glenrio on Texas <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico's</b> border {{led to some}} interesting business practices. At one point, all fuel was dispensed in Texas due to <b>New</b> <b>Mexico's</b> higher gasoline taxes. The 1930s State Line Bar and motel were built in <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> because Deaf Smith County, Texas, was dry at the time. The railroad station was in Texas. The local post office, built circa-1935, was in <b>New</b> <b>Mexico.</b> A water tank <b>and</b> windmill in <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> were constructed circa 1945.|$|R

5|$|By 1912, 239 {{political}} parties {{at both the}} state and national level had pledged some form of direct election, and 33 states had introduced the use of direct primaries. Twenty-seven states had called for a constitutional convention on the subject, with 31 states needed to reach the threshold; Arizona <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> each achieved statehood that year (bringing the total number of states to 48), and were expected to support the motion. Alabama and Wyoming, already states, had passed resolutions in favor of a convention without formally calling for one.|$|E
5|$|National monuments {{are located}} in 31 {{states as well as}} in the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Minor Outlying Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Arizona, with 18, has the largest number of {{national}} monuments, followed by California with 17 <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> with 14. At least 65 national monuments protect places of natural significance, including 12 geological sites, seven marine sites, and five volcanic sites. Twenty-three national monuments have major sites associated with Native Americans. Thirty-three are other historical sites, including twelve forts.|$|E
5|$|The Gila monster {{is found}} in the Southwestern United States and Mexico, a range {{including}} Sonora, Arizona, parts of California, Nevada, Utah, <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> (potentially including Baja California). They inhabit scrubland, succulent desert, and oak woodland, seeking shelter in burrows, thickets, and under rocks in locations with ready access to moisture. In fact, Gila monsters seem to like water and can be observed immersing themselves in puddles of water after a summer rain. They avoid living in open areas such as flats and farmland.|$|E

5|$|The Mesa Verdeans survived using a {{combination}} of hunting, gathering, and subsistence farming of crops such as corn, beans, and squash. They built the mesa's first pueblos sometime after 650, {{and by the end of}} the 12th century, they began to construct the massive cliff dwellings for which the park is best known. By 1285, following a period of social and environmental instability driven by a series of severe and prolonged droughts, they abandoned the area and moved south to locations in Arizona <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico,</b> including Rio Chama, Pajarito Plateau, and Santa Fe.|$|E
5|$|After the executions, Hancock was {{assigned}} {{command of the}} newly organized Middle Military Department, headquartered in Baltimore. In 1866, on Grant's recommendation, Hancock was promoted to major general and was transferred, later that year, to command of the military Department of the Missouri, which included the states of Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Hancock reported to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and took up his new posting. Soon after arriving, he {{was assigned}} by General Sherman to lead an expedition {{to negotiate with the}} Cheyenne and Sioux, with whom relations had worsened since the Sand Creek massacre. The negotiations got off to a bad start, and after Hancock ordered the burning of an abandoned Cheyenne village in central Kansas, relations became worse than when the expedition had started. There was little loss of life on either side, but the mission could not be called a success.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite {{attended}} Corpus Christi High School and Austin College; at {{the latter}} school, he {{was active in}} several student organizations and was moderately religious. He earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1952 and subsequently enrolled at Union Presbyterian Seminary to study theology, hoping to become a minister. He married Anne Pearce around that time, and they later had two children. Early in his seminary studies, he {{decided to leave the}} school to pursue a career in music, becoming the music director of a Presbyterian church in North Carolina. He was a baritone singer and enjoyed spirituals and the music of Handel. In 1954, he was drafted by the United States Army and served in Austria <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> {{as a member of the}} Army Signal Corps. He left the military in 1956 and enrolled at the University of Colorado, where he earned a master's degree in music and focused on musical theater.|$|E

5|$|Cable {{television}} {{service in}} the area is provided by Cox Communications, which acquired Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI)'s franchise rights to the area in a $2.85-billion deal (which also included the purchase of AT Broadband's Louisiana cable systems, minority ownership of TCA Cable TV systems in Texas, Louisiana <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico,</b> and TCI's Peak Cablevision systems in four other Oklahoma cities, and select markets in Arkansas, Utah and Nevada) in July 1999; Cox assumed control of TCI's Tulsa-area systems on March 15, 2000. AT U-verse inaugurated {{service in the}} area in July 2008, with an initial local rollout of its internet protocol television, broadband Internet and telephone services in portions of Tulsa, and the suburbs of Owasso and Jenks.|$|E
5|$|Carnivàle {{interiors}} were filmed at Santa Clarita Studios in Santa Clarita, California, {{while the}} show's many exterior scenes were filmed on Southern California locations. The scenes of fictional California town of Mintern, where {{the stories about}} Brother Justin and Iris in Season 1 were based, were shot at Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills. The carnival set itself was moved around the greater Southern California area, to movie ranches and to Lancaster, which were to replicate the states of Oklahoma, Texas, <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico.</b> The permanent filming location of the carnival in Season 2 was Big Sky Ranch, which was also used for Brother Justin's new home in fictional New Canaan.|$|E
5|$|During the Act's early history, Section 3(c) {{was little}} used; no jurisdictions were bailed in until 1975. Between 1975 and 2013, 18 jurisdictions were bailed in, {{including}} 16 {{local governments and}} the states of Arkansas <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Although the Supreme Court held the Section 4(b) coverage formula unconstitutional in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), it did not hold Section 3(c) unconstitutional. Therefore, jurisdictions may continue to be bailed-in and subjected to Section 3(c) preclearance. In the months following Shelby County, courts began to consider requests by the Attorney General and other plaintiffs to bail in the states of Texas and North Carolina, and in January 2014 a federal court bailed in Evergreen, Alabama.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Philip J. Currie, {{benefiting from}} much more {{extensive}} finds {{and a general}} increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls {{and came to the}} conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought. The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are sister taxa, more closely related to each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from Alaska <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico,</b> and Currie suggested that the Albertosaurus-Gorgosaurus situation may be clarified once these are described fully. Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation, but some have not.|$|E
5|$|In Alaska, {{the gray}} wolf {{population}} {{is estimated at}} 6,000–7,000, and can be legally harvested during hunting and trapping seasons, with bag limits and other restrictions. As of 2002, there are 250 wolves in 28 packs in Yellowstone, and 260 wolves in 25 packs in Idaho. The gray wolf received Endangered Species Act (ESA) protection in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan in 1974, and was re-classed from endangered to threatened in 2003. Reintroduced Mexican wolves in Arizona <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> are protected under the ESA and, as of late 2002, number 28 individuals in eight packs. A female wolf shot in 2013 in Hart County, Kentucky by a hunter was the first gray wolf seen in Kentucky in modern times. DNA analysis by Fish and Wildlife laboratories showed genetic characteristics {{similar to those of}} wolves in the Great Lakes Region.|$|E
5|$|Late in its duration, Hurricane Olivia brought {{increased}} moisture {{into the}} southwest United States. More than 2inches (50mm) of rainfall were reported across Arizona <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Light precipitation was also reported in western Texas and southeastern California. The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings throughout the region. Near Yuma, Arizona, thunderstorms caused three major power outages and produced flooding {{that resulted in}} the closure of a portion of U.S. Route 95. In Navajo and Pinal counties, the rainfall damaged roads, bridges, sewers, and homes, which amounted to about $250,000 in repair work for the state of Arizona. The storm's moisture also produced locally heavy snowfall in higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
