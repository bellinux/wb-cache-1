Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed {{that he was still}} alive. John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years.|$|E

5|$|In {{the long}} term, however, the British backed Iraq and {{rejected}} an international {{inquiry into the}} killings, fearing that this may provoke further massacres against Christians. They also did not insist on punishing the offenders, who were now seen as heroes by Iraqis. The official British stance was to defend the Iraqi government for its perseverance <b>and</b> <b>patience</b> {{in dealing with the}} crisis and to attribute the massacres to rogue army units. A report on the battle of Dirabun blames the Assyrians, defends the actions of the Iraqi Army, and commends Sidqi as a good officer.|$|E
5|$|The {{inaugural meeting}} of the Women's Franchise League (WFL) was held on 25 July 1889, at the Pankhurst home in Russell Square. William Lloyd Garrison spoke at the meeting, warning the {{audience}} that the US abolition movement had been hampered by individuals advocating moderation <b>and</b> <b>patience.</b> Early members of the WFL included Josephine Butler, leader of the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts; the Pankhursts' friend Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy; and Harriot Eaton Stanton Blatch, daughter of US suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton.|$|E
5|$|In August 1996, Rioch was {{dismissed}} by Arsenal. He {{was replaced by}} Arsène Wenger, who became the club's first manager born outside the British Isles. Wenger had creditable experience in UEFA club competitions; at Monaco he reached {{the final of the}} Cup Winners' Cup in 1992, losing 2–0 to Werder Bremen and took the club into the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1993–94. Wenger wanted Arsenal {{to become one of the}} biggest clubs in Europe, emphasising on buying talent from all over the world <b>and</b> <b>patience</b> shown by the club's board and supporters. His first involvement in a European match for Arsenal was against Borussia Mönchengladbach on 26 September 1996 in the UEFA Cup; Arsenal lost 6–4 on aggregate. Having watched the game from the stands in the first half, he assumed control in the second, suggesting the formation should accommodate four defenders instead of five.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the NHL's {{collective}} bargaining agreement (CBA) expiring in September, teams reassigned players on two-way or entry-level contracts to minor league affiliates. The Canucks assigned 27 players, including Christopher Tanev, Eddie Lack, Zack Kassian and 2012 second-round draft pick Alexandre Mallet to the Chicago Wolves, while first round pick Brendan Gaunce was sent to his junior team, the Belleville Bulls. When the CBA expired on September 15, the NHL enforced a lockout until a new agreement could be reached. Canucks management posted {{a message from the}} team to the fans stating that they would continue with community initiatives throughout the lockout, which they hoped would be resolved as soon as possible, and thanked fans for their loyalty <b>and</b> <b>patience.</b> They also reduced their employees work week to four days and instituted a 20% pay reduction.|$|E
5|$|Productions {{during the}} 1980s {{included}} the company's first presentations of Pelléas and Mélisande (1981), Parsifal (1986) and Billy Budd (1988). 1980s productions that {{remained in the}} repertory for many years included Xerxes directed by Hytner, and Rigoletto and The Mikado directed by Jonathan Miller. In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed Gloriana, War and Peace, The Turn of the Screw, Rigoletto <b>and</b> <b>Patience.</b> This was the first British company {{to be invited to}} appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where Patience received a standing ovation and Miller's production of Rigoletto, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing. In 1990 ENO was the first major foreign opera company to tour the Soviet Union, performing the Miller production of The Turn of the Screw, Pountney's production of Macbeth, and Hytner's much-revived Xerxes.|$|E
5|$|Born in {{the central}} Victorian town of Maldon, Woodfull was the third of four sons of Reverend Thomas Staines Brittingham Woodfull, a Methodist preacher. The Woodfulls moved to Melbourne when Thomas was given a {{transfer}} to Collingwood Methodist Mission, in an inner city suburb. The religious traditionalism stayed with the younger Woodfull throughout his life. He once refused to play an interstate match that was scheduled for Christmas Day. Woodfull's father installed a net in the backyard and taught him the emphasis on defensive technique <b>and</b> <b>patience</b> that were to become his hallmark. Woodfull attended Melbourne High School and his early career was unremarkable. He made his district cricket debut in 1916 for Essendon, {{at the age of}} 19, but did not distinguish himself. He played no further cricket at the level before he gained his qualification as a schoolteacher in 1919. Because of a bout of rheumatic fever in childhood, Woodfull had stiff muscles and as a result was rejected when he tried to join the First Australian Imperial Force to fight in World War I. He was posted to Maryborough High School, and it was in the rural cricket competition that he began to gain attention. In 1920 and 1921, he accumulated 1,335 runs at average of 225.83 in the local competition.|$|E

5|$|In 1866, Sullivan {{composed}} a one-act comic opera, Cox and Box, {{which is still}} widely performed. His most successful orchestral work, the Overture di Ballo, premiered in 1870. Sullivan's talent and native charm earned him many friends in musical and social circles, including Queen Victoria's son Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. In 1871, Sullivan wrote his first opera with W. S. Gilbert, Thespis. Sullivan then produced his Festival Te Deum (1872), an oratorio, The Light of the World (1873), and incidental music for West End productions of several Shakespeare plays. He also had conducting and academic appointments. In 1875, producer Richard D'Oyly Carte reunited Gilbert and Sullivan to create a one-act piece, Trial by Jury, which was a surprise hit. Their 1878 opera H.M.S. Pinafore became an international sensation, as did The Pirates of Penzance (1879) <b>and</b> <b>Patience</b> (1881). Sullivan never married but had a long love affair with an American socialite, Fanny Ronalds. After {{the death of his}} brother Fred in 1877, Sullivan supported Fred's large family financially {{for the rest of his}} life, effectively adopting his nephew Bertie.|$|E
5|$|The {{company has}} {{produced}} six of Gilbert and Sullivan's Savoy operas. After the successful Iolanthe and The Mikado in 1962 <b>and</b> <b>Patience</b> in 1969, the last much revived in the UK, the U.S. {{and on the}} continent, a second production of The Mikado in 1986 starred the comedian Eric Idle in a black-and-white setting moved to a 1920s English seaside hotel. It has been regularly revived over 25 years. A 1992 production of Princess Ida directed by Ken Russell was a critical and box office disaster, ran briefly, and was not revived. The Pirates of Penzance was produced in 2005. A highly coloured production of The Gondoliers opened in 2006; the press {{pointed out that the}} company's diction had declined {{to the point that the}} recently introduced surtitles were essential. In 2015 the film director Mike Leigh directed a new production of The Pirates of Penzance; the critical consensus was disappointment that Leigh had chosen one of the weaker operas in the Savoy canon, but the show provided a box-office hit. The cinema live broadcast of the production broke all previous box-office records for UK opera cinema-event releases.|$|E

25|$|After {{reaching}} England, {{the reports}} of survivors of the Sea Venture aroused great interest about Bermuda. Two years later, in 1612, the Virginia Company's Royal Charter was extended to include the island, and a party of 60 settlers was sent, {{under the command of}} Sir Richard Moore, the island's first governor, to join the three men left by the Deliverance <b>and</b> <b>Patience.</b> They founded and commenced construction of the town of St. George.|$|E
25|$|Another {{trend in}} the twentieth century was the rise of the lesbian pulp fiction.
