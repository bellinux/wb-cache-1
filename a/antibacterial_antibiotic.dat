40|$|Erik Taylor 1, Thomas J Webster 1, 21 School of Engineering, 2 Department of Orthopedics, Brown University, Providence, RI, USAAbstract: The {{expansion}} of bacterial antibiotic resistance {{is a growing}} problem today. When medical devices are inserted into the body, it becomes especially difficult for the body to clear robustly adherent antibiotic-resistant biofilm infections. In addition, concerns about the spread of bacterial genetic tolerance to antibiotics, such as that found in multiple drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), have significantly increased of late. As a growing direction in biomaterial design, nanomaterials (materials {{with at least one}} dimension less than 100 nm) may potentially prevent bacterial functions that lead to infections. As a first step in this direction, various nanoparticles have been explored for improving bacteria and biofilm penetration, generating reactive oxygen species, and killing bacteria, potentially providing a novel method for fighting infections that is nondrug related. This review article will first examine in detail the mechanisms and applications of some of these nanoparticles, then follow with some recent material designs utilizing nanotechnology that are centered on fighting medical device infections.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of new antibiotics {{is one of}} the most urgent tasks facing scientists today. The escalating rate of resistant microbes creates a constant need for new or improved drugs. With the recent progress in genome sequencing a new world is opening up as researchers can explore bacterial antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters that are normally silent under laboratory conditions. Waking up these silent gene clusters harbours the potential of novel drug discoveries to fight microbial infections, cancer or other major life-threatening conditions. In this work, genetic potential of Streptomyces bambergiensis, known producer of <b>antibacterial</b> <b>antibiotic</b> moenomycin, was investigated. Whole genome sequence of S. bambergiensis showed that it has, in addition to moenomycin cluster, 28 secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, including a giant polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster composed of 30 genes and spanning over 190 kb. The product of this gene cluster is unknown and likely not produced under laboratory conditions. First, moenomycin gene cluster was inactivated in S. bambergiensis by deletion in order to eliminate antibacterial background activity. Next, constitutive expression of the regulatory gene, a LuxR family transcriptional regulator, from the PKS gene cluster was accomplished, leading to the production of a compound with inhibitory activity against Bacillus subtilis.

40|$|Rifamycin SV is an {{antibiotic}} anti-bacterial agent {{used in the}} treatment of tuberculosis. This drug can autoxidize, especially in the presence of metals, and generate reactive oxygen species. A previous study indicated that rifamycin SV can increase NADH-dependent microsomal production of reactive oxygen species. The current study evaluated the ability of rifamycin SV to interact with iron and increase microsomal production of hydroxyl radical, as detected by conversion of supercoiled plasmid DNA into the relaxed open circular state. The plasmid used was pBluescript II KS(-), and the forms of DNA were separated by agarose-gel electrophoresis. Incubation of rat liver microsomes with plasmid plus NADH plus ferric-ATP caused DNA strand cleavage. The addition of rifamycin SV produced a time- and concentration-dependent increase in DNA-strand cleavage. No stimulation by rifamycin SV occurred in the absence of microsomes, NADH or ferric-ATP. Stimulation occurred with other ferric complexes besides ferric-ATP, e. g. ferric-histidine, ferric-citrate, ferric-EDTA, and ferric-(NH 4) 2 SO 4. Rifamycin SV did not significantly increase the high rates of DNA strand cleavage found with NADPH as the microsomal reductant. The stimulation of NADH-dependent microsomal DNA strand cleavage was completely blocked by catalase, superoxide dismutase, GSH and a variety of hydroxyl-radical-scavenging agents, but not by anti-oxidants that prevent microsomal lipid peroxidation. Redox cycling agents, such as menadione and paraquat, in contrast with rifamycin SV, stimulated the NADPH-dependent reaction; menadione and rifamycin SV were superior to paraquat in stimulating the NADH-dependent reaction. These results indicate that rifamycin SV can, in the presence of an iron catalyst, increase microsomal production of reactive oxygen species which can cause DNA-strand cleavage. In contrast with other redox cycling agents, the stimulation by rifamycin SV is more pronounced with NADH than with NADPH as the microsomal reductant.
