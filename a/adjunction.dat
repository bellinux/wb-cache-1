Another such system consists of general set theory (extensionality, {{existence of the}} empty set, and the axiom of <b>adjunction),</b> augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property that holds for the empty set and holds of an <b>adjunction</b> whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.|$|E

Each {{distributor}} between categories enriched {{over a small}} quantaloid Q {{gives rise}} to two <b>adjunctions</b> between the categories of contravariant and covariant presheaves, and hence to two monads. These two <b>adjunctions</b> are respectively generalizations of Isbell <b>adjunctions</b> and Kan extensions in category theory. It is proved that these two processes are functorial with infomorphisms playing as morphisms between distributors; and that the free cocompletion functor of Q-categories factors through both of these functors. 1...|$|R

We also show there is no left adjoint to the inclusion functor from C 0 to any larger category of cpo's which contains a simple five-element domain. As a corollary, there is no left adjoint to the inclusion functor from C 0 to the category of L-domains. We also investigate <b>adjunctions</b> between categories which contain C 0, such as SFP, and subcategories of C 0. Of course, it is well-known that each of the three standard power domain constructs gives rise to a left adjoint. Since the Hoare and Smyth power domains are Scott domains, we can regard each of these two <b>adjunctions</b> as left adjoints to inclusion functors from appropriate subcategories of C 0.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of categorical logic or categorical type theory, pred-icate logics and type theories are understood as fibrations with structure. Fibrations, or fibred categories, provide an abstract account of the notions of indexing and substitution. These notions {{are central to the}} interpretations of predicate logics and type theories with dependent types or polymorphism. In these systems, predicates/dependent types are indexed by the contexts which declare the types of their free variables, and there is an operation of substitution of terms for free variables. With this setting, it is natural to give a category-theoretic account of certain logical issues in terms of fibrations. In this thesis we explore logical predicates for simply typed theories, induction principles for inductive data types, and indeterminate elements for fibrations in relation to polymorphic λ-calculi. The notion of logical predicate is a useful tool in the study of type the-ories like simply typed λ-calculus. For a categorical account of this concept, we are led to study certain structure of fibred categories. In particular, the kind of structure involved in the interpretation of simply typed λ-calculus, 2 namely cartesian closure, is expressed in terms of <b>adjunctions.</b> Hence we are led to consider <b>adjunctions</b> between fibred categories. We give a character-isation of these <b>adjunctions</b> which allows us to provide structure, given by <b>adjunctions,</b> to a fibred category in terms of appropriate structure on its base and its fibres. By expressing the abovementioned categorical structure logically, in the internal language of a fibration, we can give an account of logical predicate...|$|R
