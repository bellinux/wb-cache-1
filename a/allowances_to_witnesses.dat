50|$|Conduct {{money is}} money paid in some legal systems {{to a person}} under the {{compulsion}} of a summons <b>to</b> <b>witness</b> (subpoena) <b>to</b> pay for their expenses to attend in court. It generally incorporates a daily rate for each day the witness must attend in court (with a one-day minimum), plus a travel <b>allowance</b> <b>to</b> allow the <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> get {{to the place of}} the hearing. Generally, conduct money must be delivered with the summons for it to have legal effect. In some jurisdictions, however, failure to provide conduct money at the time the summons is served is only an irregularity but not fatal to the validity of the summons. Witnesses are generally entitled to additional conduct money if their attendance is required on more days than anticipated. Moreover, witnesses who are required to make an overnight stay to attend in court on more than one day are generally entitled <b>to</b> an <b>allowance</b> for accommodation and meals.|$|R

Scarcity is created in the scheme through the allocation of fewer allowances than emissions, resulting in emitters having to choose between reducing their emissions in line with their allowance allocations, or purchasing additional <b>allowances</b> <b>to</b> cover their excess emissions levels...|$|R
