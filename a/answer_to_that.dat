25|$|The {{band was}} {{required}} {{to create a new}} name to sign up to Spinefarm Records. The contract with Shiver records had already been signed under the name of Inearthed. The <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> problem came as the members looked for good names in their local phone book. When they stumbled upon Lake Bodom, they realized that it was a name with impact and one which had an interesting story behind it. A long list of possible names involving the word Bodom was then made, and they settled with Children of Bodom. The band's name is derived from the Lake Bodom murders.|$|E

C., he said [...] "Climate change occurs no matter what. The question is, can and should the federal government do something about it.(sic) And I would argue the federal government, with all its tax and regulatory schemes, can't." [...] On October 13, 2014, during a debate against Democratic challenger Rob Zerban in Kenosha, Wisconsin both candidates were asked if human activity was to blame for climate change, and Ryan answered: [...] "I don't know the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question. I don't think science does, either." ...|$|E
500|$|Dylan's {{performances}} in China in April 2011 generated controversy. Some criticised {{him for not}} making any explicit comment on the political situation in China, and for, allegedly, allowing the Chinese authorities to censor his set list. Others defended Dylan's performances, arguing that such criticism represented a misunderstanding of Dylan's art, and that no evidence for the censorship of Dylan's set list existed. In response to these allegations, Dylan posted a statement on his website: [...] "As far as censorship goes, the Chinese government had asked for {{the names of the}} songs that I would be playing. There's no logical <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> so we sent them the set lists from the previous 3 months. If there were any songs, verses or lines censored, nobody ever told me about it and we played all the songs that we intended to play." ...|$|E

500|$|Hay's {{efforts to}} shape Lincoln's image {{increased}} his own prominence and reputation in making his association (and that of Nicolay) with the assassinated president ever more remarkable and noteworthy. According to Zeitz, [...] "the greater Lincoln grew in death, the greater they grew for having known him so well, and so intimately, in life. Everyone {{wanted to know}} them if only to ask {{what it had been}} like—what he had been like." [...] Their <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> expressed in ten volumes of biography, Gale wrote, [...] "has been incredibly influential". In 1974, Lincoln scholar Roy P.

Zeitz concurs, [...] "Americans today understand Abraham Lincoln much as Nicolay and Hay hoped that they would." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Uhura and Chekov {{question}} passersby about the location of nuclear vessels was filmed with a hidden camera. However, {{the people with whom}} Koenig and Nichols speak were extras hired off the street for that day's shooting and, despite legends to the contrary, knew they were being filmed. In an interview with StarTrek.com, Layla Sarakalo, the extra who said, [...] "I don't know if I know the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that...</b> I think it's across the bay, in Alameda," [...] stated that after her car was impounded because she refused to move it for the filming, she approached the assistant director about appearing with the other extras, hoping to be paid enough to get her car out of impoundment. She had been told to act naturally, and so she answered them and the filmmakers kept her response in the film, though she had to be inducted into the Screen Actors Guild in order for her lines to be kept.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Cena {{was interviewed}} for the CNN Special Investigations Unit documentary, Death Grip: Inside Pro Wrestling, {{which focused on}} steroid and drug use in {{professional}} wrestling. When {{asked if he had}} taken steroids he was heard to reply, [...] "I can't tell you that I haven't, but you will never prove that I have". The day after the documentary aired, WWE accused CNN of taking Cena's comments out of context to present a biased point of view, backing up their claim by posting an unedited video of Cena answering the same question [...] filmed by WWE cameras from another angle [...] in which he is heard beginning the same statement with [...] "absolutely not". A text interview on the website with Cena later had him saying the news outlet should apologize for misrepresenting him, which CNN refused, saying they felt the true answer to the question began with the phrase [...] "my <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> question". They did, however, edit the documentary on subsequent airings to include the [...] "absolutely not".|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone {{film critic}} Peter Travers rated the reissue 3.5 stars out of 4, {{explaining}} {{he found it}} [...] "pretty damn dazzling". He said, [...] "The 3D intensifies Titanic. You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns {{its place in the}} movie time capsule." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, [...] "For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive." [...] Richard Corliss of Time who was very critical in 1997 remained in the same mood, [...] "I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged." [...] In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the [...] "careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments ... in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels." [...] Ann Hornaday for The Washington Post found herself asking [...] "whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> is: They aren't." [...] She further added that the [...] "3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition." ...|$|E

[...] In regards to the storylines, itself, he noted that Jack's quest in getting Milton a kidney [...] "balanced nicely" [...] with Liz's story, and that Tracy's [...] "had some good moments". In conclusion, Porter wrote [...] "For a show that doesn't always know how to end episodes, it's done really well at ending seasons." [...] TV Guide Magazine’s Sandra Kofler wrote that the [...] "He Needs a Kidney" [...] song was hilarious, and that it [...] "stole [...] season finale." [...] Patrick Goldstein, a contributor for the Los Angeles Times, was favorable to the musical number, reporting [...] "he song itself is a hoot, highlighted by a wonderful spoken-word kidney donation pitch that begins with Costello saying: 'Listen, when someone starts talking {{in the middle of}} a song, you know it's serious.'" [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett said [...] "Kidney Now!" [...] was [...] "sweet and all", and noted that the [...] "Vontella-as-Tyra spoof" [...] was [...] "brilliant." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik wrote that this episode [...] "was a fitting end for a guest-star-heavy... season of 30 Rock", but added that the finale overall was [...] "maybe average", however, [...] "the ending at least delivered the goods, with the best sitcom celebrity benefit song".|$|E
