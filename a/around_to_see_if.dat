5|$|The cook {{let go of}} the line. We rowed <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> {{we could}} not get a line from the chief engineer, and all this time, mind you, there were no shrieks, no groans, but silence, silence and silence, and then the Commodore sank. She lurched to windward, then swung afar back, righted and dove into the sea, and the rafts were {{suddenly}} swallowed by this frightful maw of the ocean. And then by the men on the ten-foot dingy were words said that were still not words—something far beyond words.|$|E
25|$|While {{operating}} the crank {{a piece of}} shrapnel entered Anderson's back, paralyzing his legs but he continued to lower the boat and after looking <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> anybody else needed help, the ensign slipped over the side into an oil slick. With a broken leg Anderson swam over to a wounded officer {{in the water and}} attempted to pull him to one of the life rafts but the man died of his wound first and a few moments later the Germans lowered boats and began rescuing the Americans. The Germans fired 148 shells and one torpedo while Stanvac Calcutta fired only twenty-five, hundreds of machine gun rounds were also expended by both sides.|$|E
500|$|Looking back on {{the play}} years later, Regiels said [...] "I was embarrassed when I {{realized}} what I had done. I wanted a hole {{to open in the}} ground so I could jump in it. But that soon passed, and I reached a stage when mention of it would cause me to bristle. Soon that passed and it has never really bothered me since, except in cases when people tried to exploit it." [...] Riegels was reminded of his mistake throughout his life. Riegels once said: [...] "All the times I've run across or heard people saying 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> they were speaking about me. I still don't understand how I did it." [...] Riegels dealt with his situation by laughing about what happened. Riegels once joked [...] "If I had to do it again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way." [...] Riegels also said [...] "You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's pretty hard to lie out of it." [...] When presented his membership card into the Georgia Tech Lettermen's Club 42 years later, Riegels quipped, [...] "Believe me, I feel I've earned this." ...|$|E
60|$|She blushed very deeply--then averted her eyes--then {{slowly and}} {{cautiously}} looked <b>around,</b> apparently <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> my rash action had been noticed--then leaned over toward {{the gentleman who}} sat by her side.|$|R

2500|$|Johnny took {{matters into}} his own hands, asking <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> they could find a {{replacement}} drummer {{at least for the}} remainder of the tour. Clem Burke of Blondie would end up filling in for Richie for two shows on tour, going under the alias of Elvis Ramone. The dates were August 28, 1988 in Providence, Rhode Island, and August 29 in Trenton, New Jersey, to which Johnny deemed the whole situation a [...] "disaster" [...] because of his drumming style, commenting: [...] "double-time on the hi-hat was totally alien to him." [...] With regards to the setlist, Clem was criticized for playing [...] "Durango 95"'s fills incorrectly, and for misplaying the introduction on [...] "Rock 'n' [...] "Roll Radio," [...] forcing Johnny and Dee Dee to improvise on stage. He also was reportedly unable to maintain the faster tempo of the songs [...] "Freak of Nature" [...] and [...] "Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment." ...|$|E

60|$|Dave was right, and {{an instant}} later the French hunter and trapper stepped into the opening. He gazed <b>around</b> sharply <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> the young pioneer had any companions with him.

60|$|Rob ran <b>around</b> {{the house}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> {{there was an}} open window, and finding none, {{he went back to}} the door and lay down to wait.|$|R

60|$|Bo-Peep {{was much}} grieved {{over the loss}} that had befallen her dear sheep, and so, driving them before her, she wandered <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> by any chance she could find the lost tails.|$|E

60|$|For {{a moment}} {{she glanced at the}} women <b>around</b> her, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> there was one look of pity or interest; but faces {{distorted}} with hate and exultation met her eyes, and threats and imprecations assailed her ears. The sight, though it appalled, yet nerved her with courage. A pitying look would have melted her,--this rage against one so helpless as herself nerved her; and, with her eyes turned upwards and her lips moving in prayer, she kept along.|$|R
50|$|After getting spooked by Tiny, Panny (along {{with the}} entire household) makes friends with the little tiger. The next day, Mimiko goes <b>to</b> ask <b>around</b> town, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> anyone knows where Tiny is from, only to lose both Panny and Tiny when Tiny goes <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his real mother.

60|$|I was humbled, abashed. She {{had seen}} {{me at my}} morning devotions, {{and this was the}} way she {{interpreted}} them.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the converters, many embedded microprocessors include a variety of timers as well. One {{of the most common}} types of timers is the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT). A PIT may either count down from some value to zero, or up to the capacity of the count register, overflowing to zero. Once it reaches zero, it sends an interrupt to the processor indicating that it has finished counting. This is useful for devices such as thermostats, which periodically test the temperature <b>around</b> them <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> they need <b>to</b> turn the air conditioner on, the heater on, etc.|$|R
60|$|To this Nat Poole did not reply. Plainly he {{was annoyed}} at being {{discovered}} in his present position. Dave and Roger looked <b>around,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> anybody else {{was in the}} vicinity, and then, turning, walked {{in the direction of}} the other bonfires.|$|E

50|$|Hildebrand was {{the host}} of {{television}} series Dumb, Drunk and Racist, which debuted on ABC2 on Wednesday 20 June 2012. The fourth highest rating Australian program {{in the history of}} ABC2 , Dumb, Drunk and Racist followed Hildebrand and four Indian travellers <b>around</b> Australia <b>to</b> test whether the popular Indian perception of Australians as stupid, intoxicated bigots was correct. Early figures for the first episode had average audience numbers in the five capital cities alone at 266,000, with a peak of just under 320,000. He went on to host Shitsville Express which aired 2 July 2013 on ABC2.

2500|$|Many {{travelers}} {{described what}} they saw during the attack to reporters. One man stated, [...] "We came right to international departures and saw the man randomly shooting. He was just firing at anyone coming in front of him. He was wearing all black. His face was not masked. I was 50 meters away from him." [...] He continued, [...] "We ducked behind a ticket counter but I stood up and watched him. Two explosions went off shortly after one another. By that time he had stopped shooting." [...] Lastly he said [...] "He turned around and started coming towards us. He was holding his gun inside his jacket. He looked <b>around</b> anxiously <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> anyone {{was going to stop}} him and then went down the escalator ... We heard some more gunfire and then another explosion, and then it was over." ...|$|R
60|$|But Reddy {{sat there}} {{only for a}} minute. He was too eager {{to find out if}} it would prove to be {{possible}} to get inside that henhouse. Running swiftly but cautiously past the henhouse and along one side of the henyard, he peeped <b>around</b> the corner <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> by any chance the yard gate had been left open. His heart gave a leap of joy as he saw that the gate was not quite closed. All he would have to do would be to push it and enter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jumping lobsters! But this beats all!" [...] {{went on the}} {{youngest}} Rover. [...] "I don't know if I had better tell you or not." [...] And he looked <b>around,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> anybody but his brothers was present. The grown folks had left the room.|$|E
60|$|Poor girl, she did {{not know}} what else to say; she was not of a nervous disposition, but there was {{something}} about George's manner that alarmed her very much, and she glanced anxiously <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> any one was within call, but the place was lonely as the grave.|$|E
60|$|As {{silently as}} shadows Dave and Phil {{followed}} the money-lender's {{son to the}} shed.

Reassured, Nat entered the shed, and Dave and Phil tiptoed their way up and got behind the open door.|$|E
50|$|Once {{returned}} to USA, Chen sent Mr. Jiao some public websites and also asked <b>around</b> at work <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> {{any of her}} co-workers could help. Her boss introduced her {{to talk to a}} colleague at Water Management Division of the US Army Corps of Engineers (ACE). The colleague said Mr. Jiao could talk to her directly. Chen then emailed Mr. Jiao to contact the colleague directly, without following up further. Later, the colleague reported Chen to the government security agency, suggesting that Chen may be a Chinese spy and may be stealing government information. Since then, Chen had unwittingly become a Chinese spy suspect by the US government.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001-2002 the UK {{government}} {{performed a}} study on 18 untrained subjects. The experimenters recorded the E field and H field <b>around</b> each viewer <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> the cerebral activity of successful viewings caused higher-than-usual fields to be emitted from the brain. However, the experimenters {{did not find any}} evidence that the viewers had accessed the targets in the data collection phase, the project was abandoned, and the data was never analyzed since no RV activity had happened. Some [...] "narrow-band" [...] E-fields were detected during the viewings, but they were attributed to external causes. The experiment was disclosed in 2007 after a UK Freedom of Information request.|$|R
