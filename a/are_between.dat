Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first completely denies the relational character of mental states and the second considers mental states as two-place relations. The latter position can be further subdivided into the Carnapian view that such relations <b>are</b> <b>between</b> individuals and sentences of natural languages and the Fregean view that they <b>are</b> <b>between</b> individuals and the propositions expressed by such sentences.|$|E

Semi- hardwood cuttings {{were exposed to the}} rooting media for 60 days, and then, they all were removed from media to determine the survival rate, rooting rate, root number, root length, root diameter and root quality.
