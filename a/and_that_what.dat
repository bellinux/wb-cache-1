5|$|Her book Intercourse, which {{addresses}} {{the role of}} sexual intercourse in society, has been interpreted as opposing all heterosexual intercourse, but Dworkin said it does not <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> she was against was male domination by intercourse. Some critics of Dworkin accused her of supporting incest, and she sued for defamation, but a court did not forbid the criticism. She subsequently wrote much in opposition to incest. She wrote some fiction, some of which was held for a time by Canadian customs authorities before it was released, giving rise to a controversy over whether her support for antipornography law had led to the seizure of her own work. When {{she said she was}} drugged and raped in a hotel in 1999, controversy over the truth of the allegations followed. In her later years, she suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which limited her mobility. She died of acute myocarditis at the age of 58.|$|E

25|$|This remains, however, disputed. The Oratory of the Paraclete claims Abelard and Héloïse {{are buried}} there <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> exists in Père-Lachaise {{is merely a}} monument, or cenotaph. According to Père-Lachaise, the remains of both lovers were {{transferred}} from the Oratory in the early 19th century and reburied in the famous crypt on their grounds. Others believe that while Abelard is buried in the tomb at Père-Lachaise, Heloïse's remains are elsewhere.|$|E

Murk, the war-profiteer who did not fight and who instead made a fortune from the fighting, and who attempts to steal the soldier's fiancée, symbolizes that feeling by the working class of having been cheated.|$|E

25|$|Lenneberg {{was also}} one of the first {{cognitive}} scientists to begin development of the Universalist theory of language that was formulated by Chomsky in the form of Universal Grammar, effectively arguing that all languages share the same underlying structure.

This theory became the dominant paradigm in American linguistics from the 1960s through the 1980s, while linguistic relativity became the object of ridicule.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} which the Hohokam {{abandoned}} the village is unknown. There was a radical decline in the procurement and trade of raw shell from Mexico and its manufacture into jewelry. The transition from pit-houses (a primitive dwelling dug {{into the ground and}} roofed over) to pit-rooms and the introduction of spherical spindle whorls may have added to the relatively sudden and widespread abandonment or relocation of many Hohokam villages and a short-lived population decline. Archaeological evidence, such as the ones found at Indian Mesa, indicate that the Hohokams did not vanish nor did they abandon their village overnight. It is believed that the cultural collapse of the Hohokam was a process that lasted several generations <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> may have remained of their culture was passed on to their descendants, the Pima and Tohono O'odham peoples. The ruins in the mesa are some of the best-preserved pieces left behind by this Indian community. The ruins and the mesa are now {{under the jurisdiction of the}} U.S. Bureau of Land Management and monitored by the Arizona Site Stewards.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the belief}} that John was taught at both the Carmelite College of San Andrès and at the University of Salamanca has been criticised. He argues, firstly, that {{it is unclear whether}} there were in fact lectures in arts and {{theology}} at the College of San Andrès before 1571, that a reconstruction of the typical timetable of teaching at the University of Salamanca shows that there would have been little time for extra teaching at the College of the San Andrès, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> therefore happened at San Andrès (if indeed it happened at all) is therefore likely to have taken the form of rehearsals, preparation of classes, and not in an official form — making the idea that John received systematic exposure to Baconthorpe less likely. More controversially, Bezares calls into question whether John even studied theology at the University of Salamanca. The philosophy courses John probably took in logic, natural and moral philosophy, can be reconstructed, but Bezares argues that John in fact abandoned his studies at Salamanca in 1568 to join Teresa, rather than having graduated, meaning that he did not study theology in Salamanca.|$|E

The beat is set the time signature of common time and moves at a fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. The song also has the sequence of G-Bm7-G/C-D-Em-D as its chord progression. Houston's vocals in the song span from the note of E4 to the high note of G5. Lyrically, the song speaks about the protagonist trying to discern whether a boy she likes will ever like her back. She is also hesitant, because her friends tell her [...] "love can be deceiving", and she is so shy that she cannot phone him. Later, she feels {{that it might be}} a dream, but realizes that [...] "there's no mistaking", <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> she feels is really love.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the first}} free {{practice}} crash between Nakajima and Jarvis, Davidson called for cars to {{be equipped with}} brighter flashing rain lights <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> happened to his co-driver was [...] "every driver's worst nightmare".

Toyota's technical director Pascal Vasselon believed Nakajima's lack of reaction time along with the absence of flashing rain lights contributed to his injury. Christopher Reinke, Audi Sport's Le Mans Prototype manager, stated such a measure had been discussed but the issue was complex, while the Automobile Club de l'Ouest's (ACO) sporting manager, Vincent Beaumesnil, said he was unsure that brighter lights would have assisted Nakajima. In early June, the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the ACO, required all Le Mans Prototype cars carry additional flashing rain lights {{at the rear of}} their cars from the 24 Hours of Le Mans onward after the FIA's Endurance Committee observed their usage under wet weather conditions and felt there was an improvement in visibility.|$|E
