A European correspondent for Time, Inc., who later became chief of the Time-Life news bureaus in Paris and London (for a time he ran both simultaneously), Laguerre attracted Henry Luce's attention in 1956 with his singular coverage of the Winter Olympic Games in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, which became the core of SIs coverage of those games. In May 1956, Luce brought Laguerre to New York to become <b>assistant</b> <b>managing</b> editor of the magazine. He was named managing editor in 1960, and he more than doubled the circulation by instituting a system of departmental editors, redesigning the internal format, and inaugurating the unprecedented use in a news magazine of full-color photographic coverage of the week's sports events.

500|$|Meanwhile, Laguerre was {{attracting}} {{the attention of}} Time, Inc.'s top brass. [...] In 1948, {{he was promoted to}} Paris bureau chief and, in December 1950, he was brought to New York City by Time founder Henry Luce for a special one-year assignment to work out of the main Time offices. [...] He returned to Europe in 1951 to serve as London bureau chief. [...] In 1955, after the sudden death of the Paris bureau chief, he was given that position back, and for a time he held both posts simultaneously. [...] While Time bureau chief of London and Paris, he also spent some time writing about his favorite subject, sports, for the magazine, for which he covered the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland, and the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. [...] In early 1956, he accepted a temporary assignment to head a contingent of writers to cover the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy for Time, Inc.'s fledgling Sports Illustrated, started two years earlier by Luce. [...] His first article for the magazine was a piece on the dominance of the Soviet Union in their first Winter Olympics.

500|$|Laguerre was {{promoted}} to managing editor of Sports Illustrated in May 1960, after four years as <b>assistant</b> <b>managing</b> editor. [...] His time at the magazine was instrumental in saving what was, when he took over, a financially insolvent publication. [...] He would serve as managing editor for fourteen years, leading the magazine {{for a total of}} 704 issues, then a record among Time, Inc. managing editors. [...] During his tenure, the circulation grew from 900,000 to 2,250,000 issues, and the advertising budget grew from $11.9 million to $72.2 million. [...] He altered {{the look and feel of}} the magazine, changing its focus from a lifestyle magazine that focused on leisure sports, to one that covered the major American team sports, at a time when television vastly altered the way in which such sports were covered. [...] As such, he kept Sports Illustrated at the head of the growth of interest in these sports. [...] He also placed a heavy emphasis on the use of color photography and late deadline, to keep the magazine up to date and visually appealing. [...] He hired and encouraged writers who were masters at prose, emphasizing writing over sportswriting, and the crop of writers he brought to the magazine, including Frank Deford, Dan Jenkins, Budd Schulberg, and Gil Rogin, helped change the way people wrote about sports.|$|E
500|$|Shakur {{was shot}} {{multiple}} {{times in a}} drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada, on September 7, 1996, and died six days later on September 13, 1996 of complications from the gunshot wounds. Rumors of Wallace's involvement with Shakur's murder were reported almost immediately. A two-part series Chuck Philips wrote for the Los Angeles Times in 2002, [...] "Who Killed Tupac Shakur?", based on police reports and multiple sources reported that [...] "the shooting {{was carried out by}} a Compton gang called the Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur a few hours earlier" [...] and that Wallace paid for the gun. His family publicly denied the report, producing documents purporting to show that the rapper was in New York and New Jersey at the time. The New York Times called the documents inconclusive, stating: The pages purport to be three computer printouts from Daddy's House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called Nasty Boy on the night Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace wrote half the session, was In and out/sat around and laid down a ref, shorthand for a reference vocal, the equivalent of a first take. But nothing indicates when the documents were created. And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, {{said in an interview that}} he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. We would have heard about it, Mr. Alfred said." [...] Moreover, Philips' article was based on multiple sources. As the <b>Assistant</b> <b>Managing</b> Editor of the LA Times Mark Duvoisin wrote: [...] "Philips' story has withstood all challenges to its accuracy, ... remains the definitive account of the Shakur slaying." [...] Faith Evans remembered her husband calling her the night of Shakur's death and crying due to him being in shock. Evans added, [...] "I think it’s fair to say he was probably afraid, given everything that was going on at that time and all the hype that was put on this so-called beef that he didn’t really have in his heart against anyone." [...] Wayne Barrow, Wallace's co-manager at the time, said Wallace was recording the song [...] "Nasty Girl" [...] the night Shakur was shot. Shortly after Shakur's death, he met with Snoop Dogg, who claimed that Wallace played the song [...] "Somebody Gotta Die" [...] for him, in which Snoop Dogg was mentioned, and declared he never hated Shakur.|$|E
