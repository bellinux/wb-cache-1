40|$|Abstract Background Lead {{exposure}} {{is common in}} automobile battery manufacture and repair, radiator repair, secondary smelters and welding units. Urinary <b>Aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> has validity as a surrogate measure of blood lead level among workers occupationally exposed to lead. This study had therefore assessed the magnitude of lead exposure in battery repair workers of three transport service enterprises. Methods To this effect, a cross-sectional study was carried out on lead exposure among storage battery repair workers between November 2004 and May 2005 from Anbasa, Comet and Walia transport service enterprises, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Subjective information from the workers was obtained by making use of structured questionnaire. Other information was obtained from walkthrough evaluation of the repair units. <b>Aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>levels</b> in urine were used as an index of the exposure. This was coupled to measurements of other relevant parameters in blood and urine collected from adult subjects working in the repair units as well as age matched control subjects that were not occupationally exposed to lead. <b>Aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> was determined by spectrophotometry, while creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, urea and uric <b>acid</b> <b>levels</b> were determined using AMS Autolab analyzer. Results Urinary <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>levels</b> {{were found to be}} significantly higher in exposed group (16 μg/ml ± 2. 0) compared to the non-exposed ones (7 μg/ml ± 1. 0) (p Conclusion Taken together, these findings indicated that workers in lead acid battery repair units of the transport service enterprises are not protected from possibly high lead exposure. Thus, strict enforcement of appropriate and cost effective preventive and control measures is required by all the enterprises. </p...|$|R
40|$|Topical <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{converted}} into a potent photosensitizer, protoporphyrin, in human hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Photodynamic therapy with topical <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> was tested {{for the treatment of}} acne vulgaris, in an open-label prospective human study. Each of 22 subjects with acne on the back was treated in four sites with <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> plus red light, <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> alone, light alone, and untreated control. Half of the subjects were treated once; half were treated four times. Twenty percent topical <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> was applied with 3 h occlusion, and 150 J per cm 2 broad-band light (550 – 700 nm) was given. Sebum excretion rate and auto-fluorescence from follicular bacteria were measured before, and 2, 3, 10, and 20 wk after, treatment. Histologic changes and protoporphyrin synthesis in pilosebaceous units were observed from skin biopsies. <b>Aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> plus red light caused a transient acne-like folliculitis. Sebum excretion was eliminated for several weeks, and decreased for 20 wk after photodynamic therapy; multiple treatments caused greater suppression of sebum. Bacterial porphyrin fluorescence was also suppressed by photodynamic therapy. On histology, sebaceous glands showed acute damage and were smaller 20 wk after photodynamic therapy. There was clinical and statistically significant clearance of inflammatory acne by <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> plus red light, for at least 20 wk after multiple treatments and 10 wk after a single treatment. Transient hyperpigmentation, superficial exfoliation, and crusting were observed, which cleared without scarring. Topical <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> plus red light is an effective treatment of acne vulgaris, associated with significant side-effects. <b>Aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> plus red light causes phototoxicity to sebaceous follicles, prolonged suppression of sebaceous gland function, and apparent decrease in follicular bacteria after photodynamic therapy. Potentially, <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> plus red light may be useful for some patients with acne...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> {{photodynamic}} therapy and methyl ester of <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> {{photodynamic therapy}} has become commonplace in dermatology {{for the treatment}} of actinic keratoses, among other clinical entities.

As a feasibility study we investigated the effectiveness of oral application of 5 -aminolevulinic acid for photodynamic diagnosis of human primary mammary tumours. The study included 16 patients with palpable breast tumours. <b>Aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> was administered at a concentration of 40 mg kg− 1 bodyweight 150 – 420 min prior to tumourectomy. Intraoperatively blue light (405 nm) was applied to the operation site. Sections of the excised tumour and some lymph nodes were prepared and analysed with a fluorescent microscope. All primary mammary tumour tissues showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity than surrounding normal mammary tissue. Fluorescence of the mammary tumours could also be discriminated macroscopically and intraoperatively. Fluorescence intensity in nonmetastatic lymph node tissue was higher in 2 out of 3 patients than in primary tumour tissue. By photodynamic diagnosis using <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> we were able to reliably distinguish primary mammary tumours from normal mammary tissue microscopically and macroscopically in all our patients. We suggest that photodynamic diagnosis with <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> for breast tumours should be further investigated and developed for intraoperative use and may well be a simple tool for better intraoperative diagnosis and recognition of tumour margins.

This induction is revealed when the pyridine hemochrome was measured under anaerobic con-ditions but cobalt chelatase activity in hepatic mitochondria was not in-creased by phenobarbital. Furthermore, certain metals inhibited ferrochela-tase activity but {{had no effect on}} cobalt chelatase. Although both delta <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthetase and ferrochelatase are located in a similar region in the mitochondria, the time course of induction for ferrochelatase is different than that observed for delta <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthetase. One of the earliest measurable responses to inducers of microsomal mixed function oxidase reactions is the induction of delta <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthetase (ALAS), {{the catalyst}} for the first step in heme synthesis (1, 2,X). Within 2 hours after the administration of phenobarbital or 3, 4 -benzpyrene significant increases in ALAS are observed (3) which coincide with increased incorporation of glycine- 2 - 14 C into microsomal heme and which precede elevations in microsomal protoheme, P- 450 and certain microsomal oxidations. Since ALAS and ferrochelatase (protoheme ferrolyase) are both associated with the inner membrane of the mitochondrion (4, 5) and since ferrochelatase mediates the critical last step in heme synthesis, it was of interest to examine whether it is induced by phenobarbital and, if so, whether it would be increased at a rate which is similar to the rate of in-crease of ALAS. This report shows that phenobarbital induces ferrochelatase activity, but at a time course different than that observed for ALAS, and that this induction is not observed when cobalt chelatase activity was measured...|$|R

40|$|Photosensitization, {{an exaggerated}} {{sensitivity}} to harmless light, occurs genetically in rare diseases, such as porphyrias, and in photodynamic therapy where short-term toxicity is intended. A common {{feature is the}} experience of pain from bright light. In human subjects, skin exposure to 405 nm light induced moderate pain, which was intensified by pretreatment with <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid.</b> In heterologous expression systems and cultured sensory neurons, exposure to blue light activated TRPA 1 and, to a lesser extent, TRPV 1 channels {{in the absence of}} additional photosensitization. Pretreatment with <b>aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> or with protoporphyrin IX dramatically increased the light sensitivity of both TRPA 1 and TRPV 1 via generation of reactive oxygen species. Artificial lipid bilayers equipped with purified human TRPA 1 showed substantial single-channel activity only in the presence of protoporphyrin IX and blue light. Photosensitivity and photosensitization could be demonstrated in freshly isolated mouse tissues and led to TRP channel-dependent release of proinflammatory neuropeptides upon illumination.
