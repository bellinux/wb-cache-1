One key <b>abiotic</b> <b>factor</b> that affects Great Plains is weather in relation to the low- relief topography as result of glacial smoothing. Low relief topography is used to describe areas that have little difference in altitude throughout the region. Low relief landscapes, such as the various types of grasslands found throughout the Great Plains, have an effect on rainfall distribution. Rainfall in this ecoregion increases from west to east resulting in various types of prairie grasslands.|$|E

The <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> influencing M. peltata invasion were investigated in this study.

40|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms resulting from abiotic and biotic interactions in nature. Plant growth is determined by <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> that construct its fundamental niche, defined as the range of conditions and resources within which individuals of a species can persist. If a plant species exhibits patchy distribution and plot size behavior, this may illustrate global or local variations in distribution of <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> within the habitat. This study focuses on the local Northern Michigan macrophyte, Caltha palustris, which illustrates patchy distribution behavior along the reach of Carp Creek. We investigated this phenomenon by testing affects of specific <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> upon distribution and density of C. palustris. These <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> included the following: soil and water pH, soil moisture, dissolved oxygen, redox potential, and phosphate and nitrate concentration in the soil. Our findings suggest that soil pH and soil nitrate concentrations may determine distribution of C. palustris, but the other tested <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> did not significantly influence marsh marigold distribution.

50|$|Copepods are diaptomids, or crustaceous zooplankton, {{that are}} found {{in a wide range}} of sizes and lake {{habitats}}. Fish have large impacts in pelagic habitats that can alter the food chain and even eliminate certain species. Diaptomid kenai is considered a large species that is less commonly found in shallow lakes with trout reproduction. They are often red in color and are easy targets for predatory trout. Lakes with an absence of D. kenai allow smaller copepod species such as D. tymelli to exist in higher numbers. This correlation suggests predation of large copepods on smaller copepod species. In lakes that are deeper and have limited trout reproduction cohabitation has been observed with an overall reduced body size for D.kenai. The presence of Gammarus, a predatory amphipod, also dictates levels within the food chain. 2011. Non-native trout, salamander larvae, or Gammarus will step into the role of top pelagic predator when others above it are absent. Similarly D. kenai will become top predator with the absence of a larger predator in the water column. These dynamic interactions also depend on a variety of <b>abiotic</b> <b>factor,</b> which provide suitable habitat conditions for both the copepod and Gammarus species.|$|E

However, {{the relative importance}} of biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> in predicting species distributions is unclear. In particular, biotic factors, such as predation and vegetation, including those resulting from anthropogenic land-use change, are underrepresented in species distribution modeling, but could improve model predictions. Using generalized linear models and model selection techniques, we used 129 estimates of population density of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) from 5 continents to evaluate the relative importance, magnitude, and direction of biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> in predicting population density of an invasive large mammal with a global distribution. Incorporating diverse biotic factors, including agriculture, vegetation cover, and large carnivore richness, into species distribution modeling substantially improved model fit and predictions. <b>Abiotic</b> <b>factors,</b> including precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, were also important predictors. The predictive map of population density revealed wide-ranging potential for an invasive large mammal to expand its distribution globally.
