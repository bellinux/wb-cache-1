[...] The first plaits in the new Uplake neighborhood were sold in 1954. [...] Housing development continued throughout the Kenmore area for the next several decades, mostly following the postwar suburban model; industrial and commercial growth followed quickly behind, and within a few decades, most of the old Kenmore dining and drinking had vanished, replaced by shopping centers, industrial development, and housing. However, one part of this new development brought its own history along with it: the Jewel Box Building in downtown Kenmore is a Seattle World's Fair artifact, moved from Seattle Center to Kenmore {{after the end of the}} fair in October, 1962.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An aero-allergenic fungus in {{the indoor}} environments has been {{associated}} with adverse respiratory symptoms leads to different allergenic diseases viz., allergic asthma, bronchitis, rhinitis, and hay fever in the atopic human beings. Moreover, fungal assessment and exposure has traditionally relied upon questionnaires for health issues especially to children. The present study is an attempt to record the incidence and seasonal periodicity of airborne fungal spores in indoors and outdoors of an industrial city house, Hosur, Tamilnadu by Petri-plate settlement method. In qualitative and quantitative way, fungal spores considerably varied from indoors to outdoors as well as from season to season. Apart from fungal growth on culture plates and spore counts, new immunoassays for extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) have enabled quantisation of fungal agents in house dust in a more timely and cost-effective manner, possibly providing a better measure of fungal exposure. The present data investigated outdoor <b>air</b> <b>harbored</b> maximum fungal spores (53 %) in comparison to indoor air (47 %). Incidence of fungal species was predominated with more number of propagules during mid winter (December) and early rainy (July) periods in comparison to other months.

40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} {{airborne}} bacteria {{relies on a}} sampling strategy that preserves their integrity and in situ physiological state, e. g. viability, cultivability, metabolic activity, and ice-nucleation activity. Because ambient <b>air</b> <b>harbors</b> low concentrations of bacteria, an effective bioaerosol sampler should have a high sampling efficiency and a high airflow. We characterize a high-flow-rate impinger with respect to particle collection and retention efficiencies in the range 0. 5 – 3. 0 μm, and we investigated its ability to preserve the physiological state of selected bacterial species and seawater bacterial community in comparison with four commercial bioaerosol samplers. The collection efficiency increased with particle size and the cutoff diameter was between 0. 5 and 1 μm. During sampling periods of 120 – 300 min, the impinger retained the cultivability, metabolic activity, viability, and ice-nucleation activity of investigated bacteria. Field studies in semiurban, high-altitude, and polar environments included periods of low bacterial air concentrations, thus demonstrating {{the benefits of the}} impinger’s high flow rate. In conclusion, the impinger described here has many advantages compared with other bioaerosol samplers currently on the market: a potential for long sampling time, a high flow rate, a high sampling and retention efficiency, low costs, and applicability for diverse downstream microbiological and molecular analyses...|$|R
