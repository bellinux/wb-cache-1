25|$|Guards {{initially}} {{laughed at}} the claims of ghosts by inmates but as time progressed some {{were reported to have}} experienced unusual activity themselves, including feeling cold spots, unseen fingers on the back of their neck, and crying in the night. The first Warden of Alcatraz, James A. Johnston, was reputed to have heard a woman sobbing while conducting tour of the prison. Occupants of the prison reported seeing prisoners from the early military prison in 19th century garb walking the corridors in A-Block which would disappear when approached by the guards, and one member of staff reputedly saw a gang of Native American prisoners marching <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> before vanishing. Phantom gunfire, cannon blasts and fire alarms going off on their own accord have all been reported. The Warden's House, now a burnt out shell since the Occupation of Alcatraz, is also reputed to be haunted; {{during the time of the}} penitentiary, several guards reported seeing the spectre of a man with mutton-chop sideburns during a party wearing a gray suit and brimmed cap, leaving the room icy cold and extinguishing the fire in the Ben Franklin stove. A phantom lighthouse has also been said to have emerged from the fog of San Francisco bay.|$|E
500|$|Despite the praise, some reviewers {{criticized the}} game for its {{confusing}} level layouts and felt they have not held up very well over the years. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer stated that Perfect Dark is [...] "not afraid to throw dead ends at you seemingly {{for the hell of}} it, or repeat textures so much in its huge maps that you can get a little dizzy." [...] GameSpot's Tom Mc Shea noted that the campaign was [...] "oddly paced", and that [...] "locked doors, unused rooms, and dead ends... can be disheartening to stumble <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> until you finally happen upon the correct door you just couldn't locate." [...] Nevertheless, he admitted that [...] "it's {{a lot of fun to}} replay them to try for high scores and figure out the many unique objectives." [...] He also remarked that that online play can periodically suffer from a significant amount of lag, but praised the amount of content and features.|$|E
500|$|Michael and Carole turn {{to crime}} {{as a means}} of getting by, with Carole taking the role of a prostitute. Carole flirts with a sleazy {{businessman}} and brings him to a hotel room, where Michael beats him to death with a lead pipe. The two walk out into a pinball background with the dead man's cash. Just then, Shorty shows up and shoots Michael {{in the head with a}} gun that Angie gave him to finish the job before Ida chases him; the bullet is seen going through Michael's skull in slow motion. Many of the movie's characters run <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> and a kaleidoscope of shocking images and horrifying events proceeds before reverting to the live action story. The [...] "real" [...] Michael destroys a pinball machine after it tilts and walks out onto the street, bumps into the [...] "real" [...] Carole, and follows her into a park. The two are seen briefly arguing before they finally take each other's hands and begin dancing in the park.|$|E

50|$|Colpoda inflataPossibly one of {{the best}} known and most common species, noted for its fitful resting stage in which it jerks <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tight <b>circle,</b> {{frustrating}} microscopists trying to photograph it live.|$|R
500|$|Charness {{singled out}} the film's famous title number and states, [...] "it's a very kinetic moment, for {{though there is}} no {{technically}} accomplished dance present, the feeling of swinging <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> with an open umbrella is a brilliantly apt choice of movement, one that will be readily identifiable by an audience which might know nothing kinesthetically of actual dance... Accompanying this movement is a breathless pullback into a high crane shot that takes {{place at the same time}} Kelly is swinging into his widest arcs with the umbrella. The effect is dizzying. Perhaps the finest single example of the application of camera knowhow to a dance moment in Donen-Kelly canon." [...] He also complimented Donen's direction in the [...] "Moses Supposes" [...] number, including [...] "certain camera techniques which Donen had by now formularized... the dolly shot into medium shot to signify the ending of one shot and the beginning of another." [...] Although Donen credits earlier musicals by René Clair, Lubitsch and Astaire as [...] "integrated", he also states that [...] "in the early musicals of Lubitsch and Clair, they made it clear from the beginning that their characters were going to sing operatically. Gene and I didn't go that far. In 'Moses Supposes', he and Donald sort of talk themselves into a song." [...] Donen's Royal Wedding and Give A Girl A Break continued to use special effect shots to create elaborate dance sequences, and Kelly used even more sophisticated animation in his film Invitation to Dance.|$|E
2500|$|The owner {{generally}} {{stands in}} one place while working the pole to make the lure [...] "active" [...] or moving. Standing in one spot and rotating to swing the pole <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> will cause the lure to move quickly in a wider circle.|$|E
2500|$|Another type of team boat uses a [...] "horse whim," [...] a type {{of horse}} mill. It has a large {{revolving}} wheel in the middle, and a center post known as a [...] "whim" [...] (or horse capstan). The horses, which {{are attached to the}} horse whim, walk <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle,</b> causing the wheel or capstan to revolve, which in turn rotates gears that rotate the paddles, or bucket wheels. The team boat of this style consisted of two complete hulls, united by a deck or bridge, but separated far enough apart to allow the paddle wheel to be set between them. They are sharp at both ends, and can be propelled backward or forward with equal ease.|$|E
60|$|But John {{was flushed}} and angry. His helmet had been roughly torn off, and blood was smeared upon his cheek. His noisy captors stood <b>around</b> him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle,</b> eying him hungrily like dogs {{who have been}} beaten from their quarry. There were Gascons and English, knights, squires and archers, all pushing and straining.|$|R
60|$|<b>Around</b> and <b>around,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> broad <b>circle,</b> went Phil and {{his horse}} and the steer. But {{the steps of the}} latter were slower and slower, and {{presently}} the beast dropped into a walk and then refused to take another step. Phil came to a halt also, but kept the lasso tight. Then the steer lay down on his side.|$|R
6000|$|Nerle {{was much}} bruised by the fall, {{and as he}} painfully raised {{himself to his feet}} a great lump was {{swelling}} behind his left ear, where his head had struck the floor, and he was so dizzy that the room seemed swimming <b>around</b> him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle.</b> But he gave a happy little laugh, and said to the prince, gratefully: ...|$|R
2500|$|Other meeting formats include: {{round robin}} (sharing goes <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle),</b> tag meeting (each speaker picks {{the next person}} to share). Some {{meetings}} focus on reading, writing and/or sharing {{about one of the}} Twelve Steps or some other portion of NA literature. Some meetings are [...] "common needs" [...] (also known as special-interest) meetings, supporting a particular group of people based on gender, sexual identity, age, language or other characteristic. These meetings are not exclusionary, as any addict is welcome at any NA meeting. NA communities will often make an effort to have a separate meeting run at the same time for members who do not identify with the common-needs meeting.|$|E
2500|$|Note that {{in these}} experiments, the only {{quantity}} that affects {{the result is the}} difference in phase between the two parts of the electron wave. Suppose we imagine the two parts of the electron wave as tiny clocks, each with a single hand that sweeps <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle,</b> keeping track of its own phase. Although this cartoon ignores some technical details, it retains the physical phenomena that are important here. If both clocks are sped up by the same amount, the phase relationship between them is unchanged, and the results of experiments are the same. Not only that, but it is not even necessary to change the speed of each clock by a fixed amount. We could change the angle of the hand on each clock by a varying amount θ, where θ could depend on both the position in space and on time. This would have no effect on the result of the experiment, since the final observation of the location of the electron occurs at a single place and time, so that the phase shift in each electron's [...] "clock" [...] would be the same, and the two effects would cancel out. This is another example of a gauge transformation: it is local, and it does not change the results of experiments.|$|E

60|$|Leaving Risley in {{the center}} of the little opening Dave started to walk <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wide <b>circle.</b> He did this with extreme caution, his head bent close to the ground and his eyes noting every root and rock that covered his path. Then he took another circle, still wider, and at last came back to where his {{companion}} stood, the picture of misery and despair.|$|R
5000|$|Blind Man's Bluff (Spanish: La gallina ciega) {{is one of}} the Rococo oil-on-linen {{cartoons}} {{produced by}} the Spanish artist Francisco de Goya for tapestries for the Royal Palace of El Pardo. The work shows boys and girls playing the popular pastime [...] "blind man's buff" [...] with one figure in the middle blindfolded and holding a large spoon while trying to entice others dancing <b>around</b> him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first {{critical}} {{reaction to the}} sculpture, based on the plaster models presented in the Salon, was hostile. The critic Jules Clarétie wrote: [...] "This thin, unhealthy women, with their wasted flanks, their elongated, furrowed thighs, are twisting <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bizarre <b>circle</b> without any grace....One has to ask by what aberration of spirit, eye and hand one could compose such a group of wild, vulgar and wrinkled dancers." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{this the}} Imps laughed boisterously and began running <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> and kicking dust upon the Royal Princess, who cried {{in a sharp}} voice: [...] "Wizard, do your duty!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll sweep <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> {{and make}} for that road leading to Cedarville," [...] he concluded, and trudged on rapidly, for the woods were dark and lonely and not {{particularly}} to his liking.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is Mr. and Mrs. Robin Redbreast, one of {{our most}} aristocratic families," [...] said he, {{swinging}} his club <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> until Chubbins ducked his head for fear it might hit him.|$|E
60|$|Sam and Tom got {{aboard and}} willing hands grasped the {{propellers}} and gave each a twist. Bang! bang! bang! went the explosions, {{and soon the}} propellers were revolving swiftly, {{and then with a}} swoop the Dartaway ran over the campus on its wheels and suddenly arose <b>in</b> the air. <b>A</b> cheer went up, and the students threw up their caps. Then Dick swung <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> quarter <b>circle</b> and headed directly for Plankville.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} 2006 FIFA World Cup Final {{match in}} Germany, in which Italy {{defeated}} France 5–3 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> penalty shoot-out, Camoranesi had teammate Massimo Oddo chop off {{a large chunk of}} his long hair {{as the rest of the}} squad danced <b>around</b> them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle.</b> Camoranesi then went up to the camera and dedicated the triumph by saying in Spanish: [...] "Para los pibes del barrio" [...] (For the guys from the neighbourhood).|$|R
50|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Solid Software, published by THQ and distributed by Electro Source. The programming credit for the game is held by D. Scott Williamson. The game spins around and <b>around</b> wildly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle,</b> changing {{the rotation of the}} map also, and making it difficult to continue in the right direction. Rock music plays in the background as one or two players attempt to negotiate a treacherous series of platforms throughout the game's 14 levels.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{wish they}} were educated {{enough to tell}} a man a {{direction}} that goes some where--for we've been going <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> for an hour. I've passed this same old drugstore seven times." ...|$|E
60|$|The three {{children}} were standing <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle,</b> operating the inter-system vidsender. He watched {{them for a}} few minutes. None of them {{looked up from the}} small box. They were intent, absorbed in what they were doing.|$|E
6000|$|She danced <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> {{several times}} without replying, {{and the boy}} feared she had not heard him; but the Rainbow's Daughter was merely {{thinking}} upon the problem, and presently she paused beside the Tin Soldier and said: ...|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> long <b>circle</b> stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At {{the very end of}} the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.|$|R
6000|$|All {{the time}} he was getting this off, he was shaking his head and looking fierce, and kind of {{swelling}} <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little <b>circle,</b> tucking up his wrist-bands, and now and then straightening up and beating his breast with his fist, saying, 'Look at me, gentlemen!' When he got through, he jumped up and cracked his heels together three times, and let off a roaring 'Whoo-oop! I'm the bloodiest son of a wildcat that lives!' ...|$|R
5000|$|The Kushites buried their monarchs {{along with}} all their courtiers in mass graves. Archaeologists refer to these {{practices}} as the [...] "Pan-grave culture". This was given its name due {{to the way in}} which the remains are buried. They would dig a pit and put stones <b>around</b> them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle.</b> Kushites also built burial mounds and pyramids, and shared some of the same gods worshiped in Egypt, especially Ammon and Isis. With the worshiping of these gods the Kushites began to take some of the names of the gods as their throne names.|$|R
60|$|At {{the first}} report the turkey cock was seen to rise in the air, {{followed}} {{by some of the}} hens, while two hens dropped lifeless in the snow. The turkey cock, however, was seriously wounded and fluttered <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|E
60|$|Atlanta {{was very}} {{strongly}} intrenched {{all the way}} <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> about {{a mile and a}} half outside of the city. In addition to this, there were advanced intrenchments which had to be taken before a close siege could be commenced.|$|E
60|$|So to {{the music}} of the {{waterfall}} the bear began dancing. He climbed upon the flat stone, made a graceful bow to Twinkle, and then balanced himself first upon one foot and then upon the other, and swung slowly <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>circle,</b> and then back again.|$|E
6000|$|Nearly every Esquimau is {{skillful}} {{with the}} dog-whip, {{and one of}} their pastimes amused the boys very deeply. The men would gather <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> big <b>circle,</b> and <b>in</b> {{the center of this}} a small object, usually of wood, would be half buried in the snow. Then the men, each with his long dog-lash, would try to [...] "snap" [...] the object from the ring. Crack! would go the lash, making a report like a pistol, and the snow would come up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little whirl, and sometimes the object would come with it.|$|R
6000|$|Then the {{man that}} had started the row tilted his old slouch hat down over his right eye; then he bent stooping forward, with his back sagged and his south end {{sticking}} out far, and his fists a-shoving out and drawing in in front of him, and so went <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little <b>circle</b> about three times, swelling himself up and breathing hard. Then he straightened, and jumped up and cracked his heels together three times, before he lit again (that made them cheer), and he begun to shout like this-- ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{breakout}} {{into the}} Atlantic of the German battleship Bismarck in May 1941 {{led to the}} Ark Royal being ordered into the Atlantic with the British fleet to hunt and sink the German ship. When the Bismarck was located, aircraft from 810 and 818 Naval Air Squadrons carried out attacks. Eventually a Swordfish of 818 Squadron, probably the one piloted by Sub-Lt. John Moffat, struck Bismarck’s aft with a torpedo, jamming her rudder <b>in</b> <b>a</b> turn to starboard. [...] Unable to manoeuvre, the Bismarck swung <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wide <b>circle,</b> allowing the ships of Force H to catch up and sink the Bismarck.|$|R
