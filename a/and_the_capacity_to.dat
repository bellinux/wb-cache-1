5|$|The {{report of}} the Commissioners was not binding, and the rivalry between {{supporters}} of the two routes intensified. An independent Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway was proposed, to build from Carlisle to meet the GPK, and the GPK itself proposed several branches, mostly for tactical reasons, to weaken or exclude the Caledonian Railway (CR), as the dominant supporter of the Annandale route. Of these only an extension from Kilmarnock to Horsecleugh, south of the mining town of Old Cumnock was authorised, by Act of 21 July 1845. The CR case was strengthened by its intended branch to Edinburgh; moreover locomotive designs were being improved, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> haul trains over the steep gradients of the Annandale route was diminishing in importance. In Parliamentary hearings in 1845, the Caledonian Railway passed the Commons and despite the GPK fighting on in the Lords, the Caledonian Railway was authorised, in preference to the Nithsdale route, on 31 July 1845.|$|E

25|$|Several {{factors are}} found to modify the {{negative}} effects of adverse life situations. Many studies show that the primary factor is to have relationships that provide care and support, create love and trust, and offer encouragement, both within and outside the family.

25|$|Bartlett {{has contributed}} to the field of study the general theory of reflexivity, which investigates the {{properties}} of systems capable of self-reference. As Bartlett has described, there are many such systems, ranging from reflexive formal systems in mathematics and in mathematical logic, to self-referential systems in artificial intelligence and the theory of computation, to self-referential systems that are physiologically based — an advanced example being that of human self-awareness <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> reflect on that awareness. Secondary applications arise in connection with breakdowns in reflexive functioning found in certain psychopathologies.|$|E

A synthetic aperture ground mapping radar enables the pilot to locate targets in poor visibility conditions. C and D models delivered since 1989 also have improved night attack abilities, consisting of the Hughes AN/AAR-50 thermal navigation pod, the Loral AN/AAS-38 NITE Hawk FLIR (forward looking infrared array) targeting pod, night vision goggles, and two full-color (formerly monochrome) multi-function display (MFDs) and a color moving map.|$|E
25|$|Human Capital is the {{backbone}} of Human Development and economic development in every nation. Mahroum (2007) suggested that at the macro-level, human capital management is about three key capacities, the capacity to develop talent, the capacity to deploy talent, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> draw talent from elsewhere. Collectively, these three capacities form {{the backbone}} of any country's human capital competitiveness. Recent U.S. research shows that geographic regions that invest in the human capital and economic advancement of immigrants who are already living in their jurisdictions help boost their short- and long-term economic growth. There is also strong evidence that organizations that possess and cultivate their human capital outperform other organizations lacking human capital (Crook, Todd, Combs, Woehr, and Ketchen, 2011).|$|E

25|$|One of {{the rare}} German Keynesians of that era, Schiller {{believed}} that government had both “the obligation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> shape economic trends and to smooth out and even eliminate the business cycle,” and his adopted policy of Keynesian demand management helped West Germany to overcome the economic recession of 1966/67. Unemployment was quickly reduced (standing at just under 1% by Autumn 1968), while industrial output rose by almost 12% in 1968. The successful economic and financial policies pursued by the Grand Coalition {{under the direction of}} Schiller was also helped by the persuasion of entrepreneurs and trade unions to accept a programme of “concerted action.” According to Lisanne Radice and Giles Radice, “concerted action” was not a formal incomes policy, but it did nevertheless ensure that collective bargaining took place “within a broadly agreed view of the direction of the economy and the relationships between full employment, output and inflation.” In addition, Schiller's economic policies were not only successful in restoring West Germany's economic growth, but they also demonsteated the SPD's economic competence, and this undoubtedly {{played a major role in}} the victory of the SPD in the federal election of 1969.|$|E
25|$|Ardill {{served as}} a doctor for four years during World War I, {{respectively}} in Britain, France and Egypt. Her application to serve with the Australian Expeditionary Forces was rejected {{because she was a}} woman. At that time, Australian government policy prohibited women from service, compelling them to join overseas units instead. Katie therefore travelled to Britain via Egypt {{to become one of the}} first women doctors in the British Expeditionary Forces field services. She worked at the County Middlesex War Hospital, St. Albans, England. This was previously an asylum, but in September 1915 it was reopened as a hospital to treat wounded soldiers as they arrived from the Western Front. It is unclear what her role was at this hospital, which had 1600 beds <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> treat 250 men in its specialist military mental health unit. However, the unit was run by the Royal Army Medical Corps and the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service, and received volunteer staff from Voluntary Aid Detachments, the Red Cross, and St John's Ambulance among others, it is likely that she entered the hospital as a volunteer recruited from one of the latter units. She then worked at the Anglo-Belgian Base Clearing Military Hospital at Étaples in France, where she was the only Australian woman doctor until 1917, and was later promoted to the rank of captain. Other service included posts at Napbury, the Dover military hospital, and the Citadel hospital, Cairo, all with the British Army.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the main quest, Kain acquires many items and abilities, which {{facilitate}} increasingly nonlinear exploration. As he collects blood vials and rune pyramids, Kain's maximum blood and energy capacity rises. By drinking from blood fountains, he receives strength upgrades, faster magic regeneration, and immunity to weather effects. Weapons include iron and fire-elemental swords, a spiked mace, twin axes, and the Soul Reaver, a two-handed flamberge. Suits of iron, bone, chaos, flesh, and wraith armor feature, and each combination of equipment has advantages and drawbacks. Spells, in the form of magical tarot cards, are used in both strategic and practical contexts, their functions ranging from summoning artificial light to mind control and the evocation of lightning storms. Shapeshifting enables Kain to assume the forms of a bat, allowing for immediate travel to checkpoints; a wolf, with enhanced speed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> jump; a cloud of mist, which enables him to pass through gates and cross water; or a human, with which he can covertly interact with, or bypass, certain non-player characters. There are 100 secrets present in the game, logged if the player uncovers hidden areas, switches, and dungeons; these encompass spirit forges, at which Kain may donate a significant portion of his blood in exchange for powerful battle artifacts. A day and night cycle passes progressively—at night, Kain's attacks become more potent, and during full moon phases, some sealed doors become accessible.|$|E

25|$|Foraging wasps gather nectar and prey for {{nourishment}} and water, resin, {{and wood}} pulp for the nest. Nectar {{is a crucial}} resource for any colony since it is used for feeding both immatures and adults. Foragers also acquire nectar at lower energy costs compared to that needed to capture prey. It {{seems to be more}} advantageous for P. exigua to take the prey in the crop, since their flight becomes less difficult. The number of prey captured by foraging wasps tends to increase as the colony grows. In addition, P. exigua have been reported performing trophallaxis with adults and between adults and larvae. Foraging for animal proteins is the most complex task for worker wasps. In order to successfully hunt prey, wasps require prey recognition, predation ability <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> return to the nest. Foragers must make recognition flights to get an image of the surrounding landmarks that compose its environment at different distances. These flights ultimately enable wasps to use visual markers to direct them back to their colony. It is extremely important that workers carry water to the nest; water collection occurs more often in the warmer periods of the day. Water is a crucial source for nest building, and in its absence, this activity would not happen efficiently. Wood pulp is also collected and taken to the nest for building and nest infrastructure.|$|E

500|$|In {{political}} sociology, one of Weber's {{most influential}} contributions is his [...] "Politics as a Vocation" [...] (Politik als Beruf) essay.

Weber wrote that politics is the sharing of state's power between various groups, and political leaders are those who wield this power. A politician must not be a man of the [...] "true Christian ethic", understood by Weber as being the ethic of the Sermon on the Mount, that is to say, the injunction to turn the other cheek. An adherent of such an ethic ought rather to be understood to be a saint, for it is only saints, according to Weber, that can appropriately follow it. The political realm is no realm for saints; a politician ought to marry the ethic of attitude and the ethic of responsibility (" [...] vs [...] ") and must possess both a passion for his vocation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> distance himself from the subject of his exertions (the governed).|$|E
