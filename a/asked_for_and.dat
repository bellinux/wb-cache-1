A few hours later, Georgia {{was selected as the}} second half of the matchup. Two days after the selections were announced, the game was declared sold out, the 10th consecutive sellout in the combined history of the Peach and Chick-fil-A Bowls. Georgia and Virginia Tech each were assigned initial allocations of 18,500tickets for distribution, and following the quick sales of those ticket blocs, each <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>and</b> received additional tickets to distribute.|$|E
5|$|Serving until January 2019, Medaria Arradondo is {{the chief}} of police. Mayor Hodges faced severe {{criticism}} after the police shooting of Jamar Clark who died in 2015. Facing new criticism when an Australian woman {{was shot and killed}} by police in July 2017, she <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>and</b> received the resignation of chief Janeé Harteau who had served since 2012, and mayor Hodges appointed assistant chief and 28-year veteran Arradondo to the position.|$|E
5|$|After {{the general}} {{election}} in November 1982, the incoming Michigan governor, James Blanchard, appointed Mansour in December to the directorship of the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS); Michigan's biggest agency. The administrative position involved oversight of public health programs including disbursement of some $5million in federal monies from Medicaid for abortions. To accept the appointment, she <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>and</b> received permission from her order and from Szoka. Szoka asked Mansour to publicly state her opposition to abortion; he said he originally gave his approval on this condition. Mansour did not follow his request. Though she personally disapproved of abortion, she knew that many others felt differently, and she determined that the poor should have equal access to abortion {{as long as it}} was legal.|$|E

5|$|In 135 BC, {{war broke}} out when Minyue invaded Nanyue. Zhao Mo, the king of Nanyue, <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>and</b> {{received}} the military assistance of the Han. In 180 BC, Zhao had offered to submit as a vassal and the Han agreed, a decision that was partly based on Zhao's ancestral roots in northern China. An army led by the generals Wang Hui and Han Anguo was ordered to invade Minyue. The campaign was cut short by palace infighting in the Minyue court. Panicked at news of an invasion, the younger brother of the Minyue king Zou Ying, Zou Yushan, conspired with the royal court to depose Ying. Yushan killed his brother with a spear, decapitated the corpse, and sent the head to Wang. The Han forces withdrew soon after.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October, Kaupthing {{was placed}} into {{receivership}} by the FME, following {{the resignation of}} the entire board of directors. The bank said that it was in technical default on its loan agreements after its UK subsidiary had been placed into administration. Kaupthing's Luxembourg subsidiary <b>asked</b> <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> obtained, a suspension of payments (similar to chapter 11 protection) in the Luxembourg District Court. Kaupthing's Geneva office, which was a branch of its Luxembourg subsidiary, was prevented from making any payments of more than 5000 Swiss francs by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission. The directors of Kaupthing's subsidiary on the Isle of Man decided to wind up the company after consultation with the Manx authorities. The Finnish Financial Supervision Authority, Rahoitustarkastus, announced having taken control of Kaupthing's Helsinki branch already on 6th, to prevent money from being sent back to Iceland.|$|E
5|$|Smith briefly {{returned}} to the United States in June 1945. In August, Eisenhower nominated Smith as his successor as commander of U.S. Forces, European Theater, as ETOUSA was redesignated on 1 July 1945. Smith was passed over in favor of General Joseph McNarney. When Eisenhower took over as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in November 1945, he summoned Smith to become his Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations and Planning. However, soon after his arrival back in Washington he was asked by President Harry S. Truman and U.S Secretary of State James F. Byrnes to become the United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union. In putting Smith's nomination for the post before the United States Senate, Truman <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>and</b> received special legislation permitting Smith to retain his permanent military rank of major general.|$|E

5|$|World War I caused several {{changes at}} the school. During the {{conflict}} and for some time afterwards, Georgia Tech hosted a school for cadet aviators, supply officers, and army technicians. Tech also started a Reserve Officer Training Corps unit; {{the first in the}} Southern United States, it became a permanent addition to the school. World War I affected the school academically as well: the United States government <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>and</b> financed an automotive school for army officers, a rehabilitation program for disabled soldiers, and a geology department. Federal aid also helped to establish Tech's Industrial Education Department, courtesy of the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917. The war also placed on hold extensive fundraising efforts for a new power plant, and made it difficult to find engineers willing to teach at the school; Matheson toured Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, and MIT in 1919 but failed to secure a single hire, as none of the students wished to work for such low wages.|$|E
5|$|In the morning, the {{supporting}} British armour {{was nowhere to}} be seen and the artillery and anti-tank units were unable to break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger inspected the brigade's position and found his battalions under fire from German tanks. Unable to contact nearby units by radio and realising the degree to which his men were exposed, he raced off under fire in a Bren carrier to locate the British armour. Coming across an armoured brigade four miles away, he implored its commander to bring his unit forward but was refused meaningful support until the intervention of Major General Herbert Lumsden, commander of the British 1st Armoured Division. By the time the tanks had arrived, the men of the 22nd Battalion had been largely killed or captured. The headquarters element of the 23rd Battalion were also prisoners of war. By nightfall, the 4th Brigade had been overrun. Kippenberger <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>and</b> received permission to withdraw his brigade from the ridge. Although awarded a Bar to his DSO for his dash for help from the British, Kippenberger was bitter about the poor planning of the operation and admitted his own errors of judgement.|$|E

Still in command of Bedford, he {{took part in the}} {{blockade}} of Flushing under Admiral John Ferrier, narrowly avoiding being wrecked in a gale on 14 January 1814. After being repaired she joined Admiral William Young, and then Admiral Scott to go into Flushing. In the summer of 1814 Walker was selected to accompany the Duke of Clarence on his journey to Boulogne to collect Tsar Alexander I of Russia and King Frederick William III of Prussia. Bedford then formed part of the fleet assembled for a Royal review. He then made two trips to bring army units back from the continent. In September 1814 he took command of a squadron carrying the advance guard of an invasion force to occupy New Orleans under Major-General John Keane. During the campaign the senior naval officers, Sir Alexander Cochrane and Rear-Admirals Pulteney Malcolm and Edward Codrington, went ashore, leaving Walker to manage the fleet, which owing to the shoal water, had to be kept a hundred miles offshore.|$|E

5|$|The Civil War {{expenditures}} quickly strained the government's already fragile {{financial situation}} and Sherman, {{assigned to the}} Senate Finance Committee, {{was involved in the}} process of increasing the revenue. In July 1861, Congress authorized the government to issue Demand Notes, the first form of paper money issued directly by the United States government. The notes were redeemable in specie (i.e., gold or silver coin) but, as Sherman would note in his memoirs, they did not solve the revenue problem, as the government did not have the coin to redeem the notes should they all be presented for payment. To solve this problem, Chase <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>and</b> Congress authorized the issuance of $150 million in bonds, which (as banks purchased them with gold) replenished the treasury. Congress also sought to increase revenue when they passed the Revenue Act of 1861, which imposed the first federal income tax in American history. Sherman endorsed the measure, and even spoke in favor of a steeper tax than the one imposed by the Act (3% on income above $800), preferring to raise revenue by taxation than by borrowing. In August, the special session closed and Sherman returned home to Mansfield to promote military recruitment again.|$|E
