40|$|The {{service life}} and/or {{reliability}} of far-infrared sensors on surveillance satellites is presently {{limited by the}} cryocooler. The life and/or reliability, however, can be extended by using redundant cryocoolers. To reduce parasitic heat leak, each stage of the inactive redundant cryocooler must be thermally isolated from the optical system, while each stage of the active cryocooler must be thermally connected to the system. The thermal break or the thermal contact can be controlled by heat switches. Among different physical mechanisms for heat switching, mechanically activated heat switches tend to have low reliability and, furthermore, require a large contact force. Magnetoresistive heat switches are, except at very low temperatures, of very low efficiency. Heat switches operated by the heat pipe principle usually require a long response time.

40|$|Heat {{switches}} {{are important}} devices in many cryogenic setups, especially in space applications and many {{systems have been}} used to allow a good ability to make or break a thermal contact. Among them, the so-called gas gap heat switches, in which the pressure is managed thanks to a small cryopump, are known to be very reliable and simple, principally due to the nonexistence of moving parts. However, in such switches, the gas characteristics and its adsorption properties have {{to be taken into account}} to determine their functioning temperature ranges. In this article, a gas gap heat switch, with a charcoal <b>adsorption</b> <b>pump,</b> tested with neon and hydrogen as conducting gas is described. The experimental results are presented and compared with calculation from a simple thermal model. Avoiding the gas condensation, limiting the OFF conductance and reaching a vis-cous regime in the ON state lead to an operational temperature window for the sorption pump that depends of the amount of gas. For neon, the minimum temperature to actuate our switch ranges from 17 K to 40 K; for hydro-gen, this temperature range goes from 9. 5 K up to 55 K. Such switches offer an extension to the well-studied helium gas gap heat switch which is limited to temperatures up to 15 K. Measured values for the thermal ON conductance (74 mW/K at 20 K for neon, 110 mW/K at 11 K for H 2) compare very well with the results expected from gas conductivity properties found in literature. For neon an ON/OFF conductance ratio about 220 is obtained at 20 K, whereas, for H 2, a ratio up around 440 was measured at 11 K...|$|E

We have generated continuously tunable millimeter and submillimeter wave radiation with a point contact Josephson junction in a superconducting transmission line. This transmission line is centered in an oversized multimode brass cavity. With a broad band detector placed in the brass cavity near the transmission line radiation is detected for all bias voltages below 2 mV. The maximum power actually absorbed by the detector is about 2 × 10 - 10 W. In order to analyze the frequency content of the radiation {{we have used a}} lamellar interferometer together with Fourier transform spectroscopic techniques. The amount of power detected in the remote detector cryostat is two orders of magnitude smaller than that detected adjacent to the junction. Only at bias voltages where a particularly large amount of radiation is emitted are spectroscopic measurements possible. For these cases the frequency of the radiation is that predicted from the bias voltage and the Josephson relation. The linewidth is less than the resolution of the interferometer.

For a fixed cycle time, if the mode operating time of the preheating andprecooling processes is reduced for prolonging the mode operating time of theregeneration and adsorption processes, the cooling capacity of the adsorption heatpump will be increased. In addition, the extra regeneration heat for increasing thecooling capacity is purely the heat required for desorption. There is no additional heatneeded for heating the adsorber. Hence, the COP can also be upgraded. In this work,the performance of the <b>adsorption</b> heat <b>pump</b> for operating under unequal modeoperating times will be investigated. It intends to obtain the optimum mode operatingtime for the preheating and precooling processes, as well as the optimum modeoperating time for the regeneration and adsorption processes. Both experimentalmeasurement and computer simulation are arranged. In the computer simulation, asolid-side resistance model will be adopted for analyzing the heat and mass transfer inthe adsorber. The COP and cooling capacity of the <b>adsorption</b> heat <b>pump</b> for variousoperating conditions will be obtained. In addition, a second-law analysis for analyzingthe exergy losses in each component and each process will be performed. The obtaineddata will be useful to finding strategies for upgrading the COP of the adsorption heatpump. 此研究擬針對一個由此研究單位(中興大學機械系) 設計組裝之密閉型多床吸附式熱泵(如圖 1 所示) 進行改良，以提昇其熱能使用效率(COP) 與冷卻能力。此系統主要包含四個吸附器、一個冷凝器、一個蒸發器與一個膨脹裝置(如圖 2 所示) ，在一個週期循環中(one cycle) ，此熱泵中每一個吸附器均歷經吸附、預熱、再生與預冷等四個過程(如圖 3 所示) ，研究中系統分別考慮使用兩種不同之吸附配對(矽膠-水與SWS- 1 L 複合吸附劑-水) 。在現階段之系統中，四個吸附器在同一時間中分別進行吸附、預熱、再生與預冷等四個過程，每個吸附器在每個過程結束後，依上述所排列之程序，分別進行下一過程，當完成單一之系統循環時，此時四個吸附器會分別回到原始進行之四個過程，而系統會依相同之模式繼續進行下一個循環。上述之安排亦即代表每個過程之操作時間(mode operating time) 均相同，但由先前研究之結果顯示，在一個系統循環中，預熱與預冷等兩個過程之操作時間可以較再生與吸附等兩個過程之操作時間為短，在固定之週期操作時間下，若將預熱與預冷等兩個過程縮短之操作時間分別提供給吸附與再生等兩個過程，則系統之冷卻能力應該可以增加，同時用以增加此冷卻能力所需耗費之再生熱量單純為吸附熱，無需增加用於加熱吸附器所需耗費之熱量，因而系統之COP 亦會提昇。此研究擬針對上述之非等操作時間下之系統性能進行探討，以期得到最佳之預熱與冷卻時間與最佳之吸附與再生時間，此研究將同時進行實驗之量測與電腦之模擬分析，模擬分析乃採用考慮具吸附劑固體側質傳擴散阻力之吸附模式，以分析吸附器中之熱質傳，進而得到各種操作狀態下熱泵之冷卻能力與COP，此研究同時擬進行系統之熱力學第二定律分析，以探討系統中各元件與各過程之有效功耗損(exergy loss) ，此分析之結果將有助於尋求提昇系統COP 之方法...|$|R
40|$|The {{worldwide}} increasing {{heat and}} cold demand leads to rising energy consumption and emission of CO 2. In contrast, {{a decrease of}} CO 2 emissions is necessary to limit climate change. Thermally driven <b>adsorption</b> heat <b>pumps</b> and chillers can reduce CO 2 emissions by use of waste heat or solar radiation. Thus, <b>adsorption</b> heat <b>pumps</b> can provide heat and cold almost emission free at high primary energy efficiencies. A drawback of the adsorption technology is the size and cost of the devices. Compared to mechanical compression heat <b>pumps</b> and chillers <b>adsorption</b> devices are significantly larger. Furthermore, the heat exchangers of adsorption chillers are bigger and low number of units leads to higher costs. Current research activities focus on the efficiency and the specific heating and cooling capacity of adsorption units to make them economically competitive. System design, new adsorbent materials and heat exchanger design are the main research topics. Much less attention is given to evaporator and condenser design although these components are equally essential for operation of the adsorption device. For targeted development dynamic computer models are usually employed. In general, the models are neither experimentally calibrated nor validated at different operating points of real adsorption systems. Thus, high uncertainty in model-based development of adsorption units remains. The present dissertation refines model-based development of <b>adsorption</b> heat <b>pumps</b> and chillers on two levels: On the system level a dynamic model of an adsorption unit is developed, experimentally calibrated and validated at different operating points of a real adsorption system. The model provides qualified prediction of system behavior since accurate and coherent models are used. Furthermore, the model allows for reliable evaluation of new adsorbent materials as it is validated against the change of material parameters. This renders the possibility of integral optimization of process and material. On the component level the development potential of adsorption units is exemplary demonstrated for the evaporator. The evaporator usually possesses low heat transfers characteristics and limits {{the capacity of the}} whole adsorption unit. Heat exchangers employing capillary action lead to significantly higher evaporation performances. In this work porous coatings are investigated to promote capillary-assisted evaporation. The coating is applicable to many heat exchanger designs and may lead to powerful and cost-efficient evaporators in future. In addition, this work studies the general influence of the evaporator on the performance of adsorption units. The developed system model is used to quantify the evaporator influence and to determine the optimal test conditions for experimental evaluations. The results allow sound design of the evaporator and identification of optimal process conditions to exploit the full potential of the adsorption unit. Thus, validated simulation models allow targeted optimization of <b>adsorption</b> heat <b>pumps</b> and chillers. This work provides a tool to increase the efficiency and capacity of adsorption units that is essential for the consumer acceptance and distribution. In future, the adsorption technology may therefore contribute to a larger extent to cover the worldwide heat and cold demand with the economically friendly use of waste heat and solar energy...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{actuated}} <b>adsorption</b> heat <b>pumps</b> {{offer the}} opportunity to improve overall energy efficiency in waste heat applications by eliminating shaft work requirements accompanying vapor compression cycles. The coefficient of performance (COP) in <b>adsorption</b> heat <b>pumps</b> is generally low. The objective of this thesis is to model the adsorption system to gain critical insight into how its performance can be improved. Because <b>adsorption</b> heat <b>pumps</b> are intermittent devices, which induce cooling by adsorbing refrigerant in a sorption bed heat/mass exchanger, transient models must be used to predict performance. In this thesis, such models are developed at the adsorbent particle level, heat/mass exchanger component level and system level. <b>Adsorption</b> heat <b>pump</b> modeling is a coupled heat and mass transfer problem. Intra-particle mass transfer resistance and sorption bed heat transfer resistance are shown to be significant, but for very fine particle sizes, inter-particle resistance may also be important. The diameter of the adsorbent particle in a packed bed is optimized to balance inter- and intra-particle resistances and improve sorption rate. In the literature, the linear driving force (LDF) approximation for intra-particle mass transfer is commonly used {{in place of the}} Fickian diffusion equation to reduce computation time; however, it is shown that the error in uptake prediction associated with the LDF depends on the working pair, half-cycle time, adsorbent particle radius, and operating temperatures at hand. Different methods for enhancing sorption bed heat/mass transfer have been proposed in the literature including the use of binders, adsorbent compacting, and complex extended surface geometries. To maintain high reliability, the simple, robust annular-finned-tube geometry with packed adsorbent is specified in this work. The effects of tube diameter, fin pitch and fin height on thermal conductance, metal/adsorbent mass ratio and COP are studied. As one might expect, many closely spaced fins, or high fin density, yields high thermal conductance; however, it is found that the increased inert metal mass associated with the high fin density diminishes COP. It is also found that thin adsorbent layers with low effective conduction resistance lead to high thermal conductance. As adsorbent layer thickness decreases, the relative importance of tube-side convective resistance rises, so mini-channel sized tubes are used. After selecting the proper tube geometry, an overall thermal conductance is calculated for use in a lumped-parameter sorption bed simulation. To evaluate the accuracy of the lumped-parameter approach, a distributed parameter sorption bed simulation is developed for comparison. Using the finite difference method, the distributed parameter model is used to track temperature and refrigerant distributions in the finned tube and adsorbent layer. The distributed-parameter tube model is shown to be in agreement with the lumped-parameter model, thus independently verifying the overall UA calculation and the lumped-parameter sorption bed model. After evaluating the accuracy of the lumped-parameter model, it is used to develop a system-level heat pump simulation. This simulation is used to investigate a non-recuperative two-bed heat pump containing activated carbon fiber-ethanol and silica gel-water working pairs. The two-bed configuration is investigated because it yields a desirable compromise between the number of components (heat exchangers, pumps, valves, etc.) and steady cooling rate. For non-recuperative two-bed <b>adsorption</b> heat <b>pumps,</b> the average COP prediction in the literature is 0. 39 for experiments and 0. 44 for models. It is important to improve the COP in mobile waste heat applications because without high COP, the available waste heat during startup or idle may be insufficient to deliver the desired cooling duty. In this thesis, a COP of 0. 53 is predicted for the non-recuperative, silica gel-water chiller. If thermal energy recovery is incorporated into the cycle, a COP as high as 0. 64 is predicted for a 90, 35 and 7. 0 °C source, ambient and average evaporator temperature, respectively. The improvement in COP over heat pumps appearing in the literature is attributed to the adsorbent particle size optimization and careful selection of sorption bed heat exchanger geometry. M. S.
