Some {{have argued that the}} system does not deliver equivalent value for the money spent. The U.S. pays twice as much as Canada yet lags behind other wealthy nations in such measures as infant mortality and life expectancy. Currently, the U.S. has a higher infant mortality rate than most of the world's industrialized nations.

50|$|In the United States, {{the debate}} {{regarding}} {{health care reform}} includes questions of a right to health care, <b>access,</b> <b>fairness,</b> sustainability, quality and amounts spent by government. The mixed public-private {{health care system in}} the United States is the most expensive in the world, with health care costing more per person than in any other nation, and a greater portion of gross domestic product (GDP) is spent on it than in any other United Nations member state except for East Timor (Timor-Leste). A study of international health care spending levels in the year 2000, published in the health policy journal Health Affairs, found that while the U.S. spends more on health care than other countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the use of health care services in the U.S. is below the OECD median by most measures. The authors of the study concluded that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S.|$|E
30|$|The channel <b>access</b> <b>fairness</b> {{can offer}} either {{throughput}} or temporal fairness by using diverse methods. If the conventional DCF is deployed, then the fair channel access gives throughput fairness. In the mean time, if {{methods such as}} transmission opportunity (TXOP) [1] are employed, where nodes may transmit multiple data frames in a predefined time duration, then temporal fairness can be achieved. In this article, we use the DCF so that throughput fairness can be provided. Several approaches have been proposed to offer channel <b>access</b> <b>fairness</b> in WLANs [8 – 10]. In these approaches, each node employs a common target CW size for fair channel access. However, despite the common CW settings, the strong signal nodes will still gain more channel access with capture effect in place. Therefore, {{we need a new}} common control reference that provides channel <b>access</b> <b>fairness</b> while not being affected by the capture effect.|$|E

This paper discusses the problem of spectrum sharing among primary users and secondary users, and carries out the centralized spectrum allocation with the following two goals: (1) maximize system&# 39;s sum bandwidth reward, and (2) maximize second users&# 39; <b>access</b> <b>fairness.</b> The spectrum allocation problem is formulated into a multi-objective optimization problem aiming at optimizing the system&# 39;s overall performance and reducing to a graph coloring problem. Graph coloring problem is a well known NP-hard problem. A swarm intelligence based algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), is used to solve the problem.

30|$|We {{have shown}} that {{enhancements}} made to e-TICA {{lead to a more}} efficient CAA, e-TICA 2, which has been verified by the simulation results. To overcome the co-channel interference problem caused by long links in a random topology, e-TICA 2 utilizes an MST rooted at the GW. The shorter links resulting from MST lead to a small interference range. Replacing SPT with MST in e-TICA 2 leads to the reduction of LICs, which reduces the interference and improves medium <b>access</b> <b>fairness,</b> thereby, increasing the network throughput. The simulation results indicate that the average throughput ratio over 25 random topologies for the 100 -node network, using e-TICA 2, is 14 % more than that achieved by e-TICA and 23 % more than that achieved by TICA. The fairness among traffic flows with e-TICA 2 is better than that with TICA but less than that with e-TICA. The two enhancements of utilizing an MST and maximum possible out of the four radios of the GW, when coupled together, yield an improved CAA, e-TICA 2, which is successful in improving the medium <b>access</b> <b>fairness</b> by reducing the conflicting channels, thereby increasing network throughput, while also improving the fairness among traffic flows.|$|E

Open access is a regulatory requirement in many countries which mandates that the access infrastructure must be open to various service providers for free competition.

30|$|The {{widespread}} {{deployment of}} infrastructure WLANs has made Wi-Fi {{an integral part}} of today’s Internet access technology. Due to the inherent characteristics of the wireless medium in WLAN systems, the capture effect significantly affects the system performance; a receiver can successfully decode a collided frame given that its signal-to-interference and noise ratio is sufficiently high enough, but results in an unfair channel access share among the wireless nodes. In this article, we propose fair capture effect aware MAC (FC-MAC) algorithm, which achieves channel <b>access</b> <b>fairness</b> using a feedback control mechanism. We determine the average waiting time as a common control reference, which provides fair channel access even when the capture effect is present. In result, the algorithm enables each node to converge to a fair channel access share. Among multiple points that yields fair channel access, we determine the optimal target reference that maximizes the aggregate throughput. Through both dynamic system modeling and extensive simulation studies, we show that the FC-MAC algorithm is stable and achieves fairness while improving the aggregate throughput.|$|E
30|$|Next, {{we compare}} the {{performance}} of FC-MAC with other schemes {{when the number of}} nodes is varied (from 2 to 32). An equal number of nodes are assigned to each strong and weak signal class, and offered load is set to 10 Mbps. Figure 9 a shows the aggregate throughput of each scheme. The FC-MAC shows similar throughput compared to Optimal CW while outperforming the other two algorithms, by up to 13 %. Meanwhile, the fairness of FC-MAC shows major performance enhancement. Figure 9 b plots the Min/Max throughput ratio {{as a function of the}} number of nodes. The Min/Max ratio of FC-MAC always maintains a level above 0.9 while those of Optimal CW, Idle sense, and DCF decrease significantly as the number of nodes increases. Figure 9 c illustrates the normalized standard deviation of per-node throughput. The normalized standard deviation of FC-MAC is smaller compared to those of the other three algorithms. From Figures 9 b,c, we see that the FC-MAC achieves better channel <b>access</b> <b>fairness</b> regardless of the number of nodes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In WDM all-optical {{networks}} where electrical re-generation is not available, physical impairments due to propaga-tion in the fibers, amplifier noise, and leaks between {{channels and}} in the switches cannot be removed at the physical layer. These effects cause calls, especially between physically distant nodes, to be rejected because they cannot meet minimum Quality of Transmission (QoT) requirements, as measured by signal bit-error rates. It is possible to mitigate physical layer effects at the network layer using appropriate Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) algorithms. We present new RWA algorithms which account for physical impairments in their design and increase QoT and fairness among users without sacrificing low blocking probabilities in metropolitan-sized networks. We also present RWA algorithms that can sharply decrease blocking probabilities in regional-sized networks using optional channel coding. All algorithms are evaluated through simulation in realistic scenarios and shown to successfully mitigate crosstalk effects and to perform better in terms of QoT and network <b>access</b> <b>fairness</b> than traditional algorithms.
