Several examples of the ODIFs for the dilation, the closing, and the clos-opening are given <b>and</b> <b>explained</b> <b>carefully.</b> For each of these morphological filters the effect of filter length is examined by using the ODIFs for the expectation and the variance. The robustness properties of the filters are also compared to each other and the effect of the distribution of the contamination is investigated for the closing as an example of realistic filtering conditions. 1.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} high-precision {{calculations}} in perturbative {{quantum field theory}}. In conjunction with detailed experimental measurements, perturbative quantum field theory provides the quantitative framework with which much of modern particle physics is understood. The results of three new theoretical calculations are presented. The first is a definitive resolution of a recent controversy involving the interaction of a muon with a magnetic field. Specifically, the light-by-light scattering contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is shown to be of positive sign, thereby decreasing the discrepancy between theory and experiment. Despite this adjustment to the theoretical prediction, the remaining discrepancy might be a subtle signature of new kinds of particles. The second calculation involves the energy levels of a bound state formed from two charged particles of arbitrary masses. By employing recently developed mass expansion techniques, new classes of solutions are obtained for problems {{in a field of}} particle physics with a very rich history. The third calculation provides an improved prediction for the decay of a top quark. In order to obtain this result, a large class of multiloop integrals has been solved for the first time. Top quark decay is just one member of a family of interesting physical processes to which these new results apply. Since specialized calculational techniques are essential ingredients in all three calculations, they are motivated <b>and</b> <b>explained</b> <b>carefully</b> in this thesis. These techniques, once automated with symbolic computational software, have recently opened avenues of solution {{to a wide variety of}} important problems in particle physics...|$|E

This paper introduces three different models to estimate the impacts of new infrastructure on labour supply <b>and</b> demand, <b>and</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>explains</b> how {{the interaction between the}} models and their outcomes should be handled. A commuter location model is developed to estimate the impact of enabling longer commuting ranges within the same commuting time on housing migration. A spatial general equilibrium model (RAEM) is developed to estimate the impacts of increased spatial competition on firms and spatial production choices. The commuter location model is then used again to estimate the residential choices of the subsequent labour migration. Finally, an interregional commuter expenditure multiplier matrix is constructed to estimate the employment effects of both housing and labour migration. The methodology developed is applied to four Transrapid (magnetic levitation rail) proposals, each following a different route within the Netherlands. The empirical outcomes show remarkable patterns of effects and differences in effects, which were not expected beforehand but be explained quite well. Thus important new insights into the spatial pattern of indirect effects of new infrastructure in general are provided. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{justification}} {{problem is}} an important problem {{in the field of}} ethics. If a prescriptive way of life cannot be justified, then it will hold no weight for those who consider it. Because there has been a rekindled interest in the ancient virtue ethics approach, given its emphasis on the agent as opposed to the action itself, I have decided to explore the justification problem in Aristotelian ethics-one of the main sources, if not the main source, of the virtue ethics approach in the ancient world. I first identify where the problem lies-in Aristotle's conception of the flourishing human life, and more specifically, his function argument, which argues for the importance of human rationality, and the virtues, which, according to Aristotle, manifest human rationality expressed excellently. As a theory of ethics that can only be justified to a small number of individuals-Aristotle's own students who had the proper moral education-it is not a strong theory. By first considering other flourishing life conceptions and their shortcomings, <b>and</b> then <b>explaining</b> as <b>carefully</b> as possible, Aristotle's own justification, I am then able to show why a justification that provides practical reasons for the life lived in accordance with virtue is the best one for humans. These practical reasons, inspired by Richard Kraut, have as their focus, answering the questions what is good for humans, and why, and allow for almost anyone to understand why such a life is the best life possible for humans...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Several {{studies have}} shown {{differences}} in survival trends between ethnic groups across adults with cancer in the UK. It is unclear whether these differences exist exclusively in the older adult population or whether they begin to emerge in {{children and young adults}}. Methods: Subjects (n = 3534) diagnosed with cancer under 30 years of age in Yorkshire between 1990 and 2005 were analysed. Differences in survival rates for diagnostic subgroups were estimated by ethnic group (south Asian or not) using Kaplan–Meier estimation and Cox regression. Results: When compared to non-south Asians (all other ethnic groups excluding south Asians) a significant increased risk of death was seen for south Asians with leukaemia (hazard ratio (HR) = 1. 75; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 11 – 2. 76) and lymphoma (HR = 2. 05; 95 % CI = 1. 09 – 3. 87), whereas south Asians with solid tumours other than central nervous system tumours had a significantly reduced risk of death(HR = 0. 50; 95 % CI = 0. 28 – 0. 89). This was independent of socioeconomic deprivation. Conclusion: We found evidence of poorer survival outcomes for south Asians compared to non-south Asian children and young adults with leukaemia and lymphoma, but better outcomes for south Asian children and young adults with other solid tumours. This needs to be <b>explained,</b> <b>and</b> <b>carefully</b> addressed in the on-going development of cancer services...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{investigate}} the impact of surface roughness on the sputtering yield of materials as a function of incident energy and angle. Material sputtering yield from ion bombardment is by far one of the most commonly studied topics. In most of the past research, bombarded surfaces are assumed to be flat and smooth in computer simulation or assumed to be exact self-similar fractals in analytical studies. However, both assumptions are not close enough to the true material surfaces. In this research, we developed an innovative way to describe the surfaces by combing the random fractal surface in computer graphics area with the ion bombardment simulation code: Ion Transport in Materials and Compounds (ITMC). With this new method, we can construct different levels of roughness on the surface and observe how the sputtering yield will change with incident ion angle and energy. Intensive literature review for both experimental and theoretical recent work is done and summarized in this study. Mathematical background information for fractal geometry, roughness exponent and fractal Brownian motion are <b>carefully</b> described <b>and</b> <b>explained.</b> ^ The developed random fractal model has been tested against various experimental results and it is demonstrated that the model is suitable to describe the behavior of surface roughness. Surface roughness exponent of 0. 53 for fractal surface with 5 keV argon ions incident on iron surface is simulated and compared to experimental data to optimize the mesh size in ITMC. Then, computer simulation of 5 keV argon bombarding graphite target and 1 keV argon ions bombarding silicon target are also compared to experimental data. All results are <b>explained</b> <b>and</b> discussed <b>carefully</b> for physical understanding and to avoid possible errors. Through this computer simulation approach, it is quite adequate to use the developed random fractal model to simulate the roughness behavior of material surfaces. ...|$|R
