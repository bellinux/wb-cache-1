2500|$|Urea {{was first}} noticed by Hermann Boerhaave {{in the early}} 18th century from evaporates of urine. In 1773, Hilaire Rouelle {{obtained}} crystals containing urea from human urine by evaporating it and treating it with alcohol in successive filtrations. This method was aided by Carl Wilhelm Scheele's discovery that urine treated by concentrated nitric acid precipitated crystals. Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin discovered in 1799 that the nitrated crystals were identical to Rouelle's substance and invented the term [...] "urea." [...] Berzelius made further improvements to its purification and finally William Prout, in 1817, succeeded in obtaining and determining the chemical composition of the pure substance. In the evolved procedure, urea was precipitated as urea nitrate by adding strong nitric acid to urine. To purify the resulting crystals, they were dissolved in boiling water with charcoal and filtered. After cooling, pure crystals of urea nitrate form. To reconstitute the urea from the nitrate, the crystals are dissolved in warm water, and barium carbonate added. The water is then evaporated and <b>anhydrous</b> <b>alcohol</b> added to extract the urea. This solution is drained off and evaporated, leaving pure urea.|$|E

30|$|There {{are several}} {{processes}} for the purification of alcohols {{and production of}} <b>anhydrous</b> <b>alcohols,</b> such as azeotropic and extractive distillation (Zhao et al. 2017), absorption (Fei and Hongzhang 2009), gas stripping (Schläfle et al. 2017); pervaporation (Bello et al. 2014; Xu et al. 2018); solvent extraction (Lemos et al. 2017), and adsorption (Farzaneh et al. 2017; Pal et al. 2017; Raganati et al. 2018). Combination {{of one or more}} of these methods can also be employed to enhance the efficiency of the process. Generally, to get anhydrous (>[*] 99 %) ethanol, at first, distillation is carried out to get a purity of 72 – 92 % (the azeotrope concentration is 95.6 wt%), followed by adsorption to remove rest of the water. The energy consumption of this combined process is about 3.9  MJ/kg compared with that of the single distillation processes (in the range of 6 – 9  MJ/kg) (Sun et al. 2007).|$|R
2500|$|Both {{processes}} {{require that}} the isopropyl alcohol be separated from water and other by-products by distillation. Isopropyl alcohol and water form an azeotrope and simple distillation gives a material that is 87.9% by weight isopropyl alcohol and 12.1% by weight water. [...] Pure (<b>anhydrous)</b> isopropyl <b>alcohol</b> is made by azeotropic distillation of the wet isopropyl alcohol using either diisopropyl ether or cyclohexane as azeotroping agents.|$|R

India ranks No. 12 in the 2008 Ernst and Young Indices [...] but may rise higher in the ranking once the country is able to coordinate tax incentives between states and state and federal legislation. At present, the country has about 11 factories in the Uttar Pradesh facilities {{and is expected to}} produce about 75 million liters of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>alcohol</b> by end-September with 7 units in Tamil Nadu (production capacity of 62.5 million liters of anhydrous alcohol); 8 in Karnataka (<b>anhydrous</b> <b>alcohol</b> production capacity of 66.5 million liters); and 4 units in Andhra Pradesh (capacity of over 40 million liters).

50|$|The Ford Model T, {{produced}} from 1908 through 1927, was {{fitted with a}} carburetor with adjustable jetting, allowing use of ethanol, gasoline or kerosene (each by itself), {{or a combination of}} the first two mentioned fuels. Other car manufactures also provided engines for ethanol fuel use. Henry Ford continued to advocate for ethanol as fuel even during the prohibition. However, cheaper oil caused gasoline to prevail, until the 1973 oil crisis resulted in gasoline shortages and awareness on the dangers of oil dependence. This crisis opened a new opportunity for ethanol and other alternative fuels, such as methanol, gaseous fuels such as CNG and LPG, and also hydrogen. Ethanol, methanol and natural gas CNG were the three alternative fuels that received more attention for research and development, and government support.Since 1975, and {{as a response to the}} shock caused by the first oil crisis, the Brazilian government implemented the National Alcohol Program -Pró-Álcool- (Programa Nacional do Álcool), a nationwide program financed by the government to phase out automotive fuels derived from fossil fuels in favor of ethanol made from sugar cane.
