5|$|It is {{not certain}} whether the year of Hamilton's birth was 1755 or 1757. Most {{historical}} evidence after Hamilton's arrival in North America supports {{the idea that he}} was born in 1757, including Hamilton's own writings. Hamilton listed his birth year as 1757 when he first arrived in the Thirteen Colonies, and celebrated his birthday on January 11. In later life, he tended to give his age only in round figures. Historians accepted 1757 as his birth year until about 1930, when <b>additional</b> <b>documentation</b> of his early life in the Caribbean was published, initially in Danish. A probate paper from St. Croix in 1768, drafted after the death of Hamilton's mother, listed him as 13 years old, which has caused some historians since the 1930s to favor a birth year of 1755.|$|E

[...] Additionally Massol, utilizing a power of attorney, signed over Willing's interest in the grant to Reavis. [...] Reavis then traveled to the East Coast.

2500|$|Legislative state {{racism is}} known to have been {{enforced}} by the National Party of South Africa during its Apartheid regime between 1948 and 1994. Here a series of Apartheid legislation was passed through the legal systems to make it legal for white South Africans to have rights which were superior to those of non-white South Africans. Non-white South Africans were not allowed involvement in any governing matters, including voting; access to quality healthcare; the provision of basic services, including clean water; electricity; as well as access to adequate schooling. Non-white South Africans were also prevented from accessing certain public areas, from using certain public transportation and were required to live only in certain designated areas. Non-white South Africans were taxed differently than white South Africans and they were also required to carry on them at all times <b>additional</b> <b>documentation,</b> which later became known as [...] "dom passes", to certify their non-white South African citizenship.

50|$|Taiwanese {{passport}} {{is one of}} {{the five}} passports with the most improved rating globally since 2006 in terms of number of countries that its holders may visit without a visa. As of 1 January 2017, nationals of Republic of China with rights of abode in Taiwan had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 134 countries and territories, ranking the ordinary Taiwan passport 31st in terms of travel freedom (tied with Costa Rican and Vatican passports) according to the Henley visa restrictions index. The Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, listed 164 countries with visa-free or visa on arrival access, which included a large number of countries requiring pre-arrival documentations such as invitations or visa approval letters (such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Vietnam). Such countries are not considered as providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival access, since the visa is usually approved before arrival and during the process of obtaining such documentations. The graph below only lists those countries which provide visa-free or visa on arrival without <b>additional</b> <b>documentations</b> prior to travelling as per international-accepted definitions.|$|R
