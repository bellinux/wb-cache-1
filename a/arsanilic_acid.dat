40|$|<b>Arsanilic</b> <b>acid</b> {{conjugated}} to poorly antigenic carriers {{was shown}} {{to be capable of}} producing good hapten-specific delayed hypersensitivity but poor haptenspecific antibody production (1). This hapten-specific delayed hypersensitivity was only transiently suppressed by intravenous injections of monovalent conjugates of <b>arsanilic</b> <b>acid</b> and N-acetyltyrosine (2). On the other hand, intramuscular, intradermal, and intraperitoneal injections of such conjugates into newborn guinea pigs produced an unresponsiveness in respect to haptendirected delayed hypersensitivity lasting for many weeks (3). Because of this ability to produce tolerance, it became of interest to determine whether these simple monovalent conjugates could also function as complete antigens in the production of hapten-specific delayed hypersensitivity.

40|$|Immunological {{specificity}} for delayed skin reactions, {{as well as}} for circulating antibody, {{has been}} investigated with many haptens coupled to antigenic protein carriers (1). With these antigens, hapten-specific antibodies were formed consistently, whereas delayed reactions were produced only with the immunizing antigen and not with conjugates of the same hapten with a different cartier protein. Thus, there was marked carrier specificity for delayed hypersensitivity reactions, as opposed to the hapten specifiicty of antibody-induced reactions (2, 3). In contrast to this, when <b>arsanilic</b> <b>acid</b> as the hapten is coupled to an apparently non-antigenic carrier such as polytyrosine, the specificity for delayed hypersensitivity is directed predominantly towards the hapten alone (4).

Histologic studies made plain that the lymphoma cells promptly die in mice treated with the arsenic-azoproteins, while those in untreated control animals continue to proliferate. Various inorganic and organic arsenicals (including <b>arsanilic</b> <b>acid</b> and 4 -arsonophenyldiazotate) were essentially devoid of effect on the lymphoma cells in vivo, and this proved true as well of the proteins employed (serum albumins and globulins procured from several species, casein, and ovalbumin).

One hundred four ducks, 8 wk old, were randomly selected for one of six dietary treatments in Trial 1 or one of seven dietary treatments in Trial 2. Different levels of roxarsone were administrated: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 mg/d, respectively, in Trial 1. In Trial 2, the experimental treatments were of the same level (11. 36 mg/d) with different sources of arsenic that included the control without As, roxarsone (3 -nitro- 4 -hydroxypheny-larsonic acid), <b>arsanilic</b> <b>acid,</b> phenylarsonic acid, O-nitro-phenylarsonic acid, As 2 O 3, or As 2 O 5. Both trials lasted 3 wk, with 1 wk on the treatment followed by 2 wk of withdrawal. Results in Trial 1 showed that a dose of 40 mg roxarsone/d increased liver weight and caused fatty liver, whereas administration of 50 mg/d was lethal. In Trial 2, administration of arsenic (11. 36 mg/d) for 1 wk significantly depressed feed intake in the roxarsone, As 2 O 3, and As 2 O 5 groups (P < 0. 05), whereas the treatment significantly decreased only live weight gain in the roxarsone group (P < 0. 05). Administration of roxarsone alone increased (P < 0. 05) serum cholesterol (CHOL), albumin (ALB), and total protein (TP), whereas only As 2 O 3 among treatments significantly decreased serum triacylglycerol (TG) concentration (P < 0. 05). Ln the roxarsone, <b>arsanilic</b> <b>acid,</b> and phenylarsonic acid groups, serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) decreased to a greater extent (P < 0. 05), and <b>arsanilic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment significantly increased the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) (P < 0. 05).

40|$|I Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} for the preparation and purification of iodinated haptens of the <b>arsanilic</b> <b>acid</b> series suitable for critical experiments on hapten binding in immune aggregates. Additional data are given on the preparation and properties of the solid immune adsorbents described by Lerman. The inclusion of homologous monohaptenic substances in the aggregates formed between these solid adsorbents and homologous antibody has been studied under a variety of experimental conditions. The existence of such hapten binding has been clearly demonstrated, as has the inclusion of hapten in the immune precipitates formed between anti-RBG antibody and both azoprotein and polyhaptenic simple antigens. This demonstration has been interpreted as additional evidence in support of the theory of the bivalence of antibody.

The existence of such heteroligating antibody molecules has not previously been demonstrated. Data presented here are interpreted as evidence for the existence of heteroligating antibody in the anti-RBG sera studied.

30|$|Monoclonal {{antibody}} (mAb) has higher specificity {{and better}} repeatability than polyclonal antibody. Therefore, {{it is more}} suitable for the detection of the substance of a particular structure. By virtue of benefits drawn from their specific, sensitive, rapid, simple, and high-throughput characters, mAbs can be widely used in practical testing. Despite being useful, it also has some disadvantages. The approaches for preparing antibodies are mostly empirical and guided by nonstandardized protocols and individual experience [46]. During the experiment, great care has to be exercised to dilution factors and cultivation conditions {{such as the use of}} feeder cells [47]. Moreover, screening for single hybridoma cell clones that produce high-quality antibody is mainly done by ELISA. When using this method to isolate target cells, a large number of cells would be lost. This makes the whole process extremely time consuming and labor intensive [48]. Furthermore, the characteristic of antibody is vulnerable to be impacted by the feature of antigen. For example, the extent and yield of the antigen against protein’s chemical conjugation may be very important to mAb. Acevedo et al. [49] proved that combining double-chemically modified carrier proteins with hetero-functional crosslinkers allows preparing tailor-made hapten protein carrier conjugates. Wang et al. [50] prepared a generic mAb and developed a sensitive ic-ELISA for detecting phenothiazines in animal feed. The limit of detections of the method ranged from 1.1 to 15.3  μg/kg. Han et al.

Most of the 552 Campylobacter isolates were able to survive at higher concentrations of <b>arsanilic</b> <b>acid</b> (512 – 2, 048 μg/mL), roxarsone (512 – 2, 048 μg/mL), and arsenate (128 – 1, 024 μg/mL), but at lower concentrations for arsenite (4 – 16 μg/mL). Ninety seven percent of the isolates tested by PCR showed the presence of arsP and arsR genes. While 95 % of the Campylobacter coli isolates contained a larger arsenic resistance operon that has all of the four genes (arsP, arsR, arsC and acr 3), 85 % of the Campylobacter jejuni isolates carried the short operon (arsP, and arsR). The presence of arsC and acr 3 did not significantly increase arsenic resistance with the exception of conferring resistance to higher concentrations of arsenate to some Campylobacter isolates. arsB was prevalent in 98 % of the tested Campylobacter jejuni isolates, regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} arsC and acr 3, but was completely absent in Campylobacter coli. To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine arsenic resistance and the prevalence of arsenic resistance genes in such a large number of Campylobacter isolates...|$|E
40|$|Adult guinea-pigs {{injected}} {{with a small}} monovalent conjugate of <b>arsanilic</b> <b>acid,</b> from 2 weeks before to the day of immunization, with hapten-conjugate in adjuvant show a profound depression of hapten-specific delayed sensitivity. The same conjugate given 1 – 2 weeks after immunization is no longer effective. More than 95 per cent of the intravenously administered monovalent conjugate {{was found to be}} excreted in 5 days. Passively administered antibody was without effect on the subsequent development of the hapten-specific delayed sensitivity. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the non-immunizing intravenous injection of monovalent conjugate is paralysing to precursor cells if given first, but that once these cells are engaged by adjuvant immunization they are no longer repressible but only transiently inhibitable, as long as high concentrations of monovalent conjugate remain in the circulation...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{autoimmunity}} {{was produced}} in rabbits following injection of altered homologous thyroglobulin. The thyroglobulin was altered by coupling to chemically defined haptens and by heating. With some preparations antibody to native thyroglobulin as well as thyroid lesions were produced. Injections of thyroglobulin coupled to the diazonium derivatives of <b>arsanilic</b> <b>acid</b> and sulfanilic acid were effective when given in either soluble form or incorporated into incomplete Freund's adjuvant) while injections of the same preparations precipitated by alum had relatively little effect on production of antibody or induction of lesions. The injection of native thyroglobulin in soluble form, incorporated into incomplete adjuvant or precipitated by alum usually resulted in production of little or no antibody and only rarely {{in the formation of}} lesions. The injection of a heterologous thyroglobulin into rabbits resulted in the production of antibody reacting with both the heterologous and rabbit thyroglobulin, but no thyroid lesions were observed...|$|E
