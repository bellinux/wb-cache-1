5|$|However, stool {{cultures}} {{should be}} performed in those with blood in the stool, those {{who might have been}} exposed to food poisoning, and those who have recently traveled to the developing world. It may also be <b>appropriate</b> <b>in</b> children young than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function. Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance. As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended. Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{possible}} to embolize vascular lesions through interventional radiology; this requires passing a catheter through a large artery and locating the maxillary artery under X-ray guidance, followed by the injection into the vessel of particles that occlude the blood vessels. The benefit from the procedure tends to be short-lived, and it may be most <b>appropriate</b> <b>in</b> episodes of severe bleeding.|$|E
5|$|The infrageneric {{classification}} of the fungus is unclear, and {{depends on what}} taxonomic characters are deemed most important. According to Takahashi, the mushroom's violet pigment, the inamyloid (not staining when treated with Melzer's reagent) hymenophoral tissue (hymenium-bearing tissue), and the smooth hyphae of the outer layer of stem suggest a placement in the section Adonideae (Fr.) Quel., {{as defined by the}} Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus. However, if greater taxonomic emphasis is placed on the weakly amyloid basidiospores, it would be more <b>appropriate</b> <b>in</b> the section Fragilipedes (Fr.) Quél.|$|E

5|$|A small {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax will typically resolve without treatment and requires only monitoring. This approach {{may be most}} <b>appropriate</b> <b>in</b> {{people who have no}} underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is shortness of breath, the air may be removed with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{widespread}} {{screening of}} the general population is a matter of debate. Some organizations (such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force) state that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening, while others (such as the American Thyroid Association) recommend either intermittent testing above a certain age in both sexes or only in women. Targeted screening may be <b>appropriate</b> <b>in</b> a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other autoimmune diseases, a strong family history of thyroid disease, those who have received radioiodine or other radiation therapy to the neck, those who have previously undergone thyroid surgery, those with an abnormal thyroid examination, those with psychiatric disorders, people taking amiodarone or lithium, and those with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions). Yearly thyroid function tests are recommended in people with Down syndrome, as they are at higher risk of thyroid disease.|$|E
5|$|Xerocomellus zelleri {{was first}} {{described}} by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912, based on specimens he {{found on the}} campus of the University of Washington. Murrill named it Ceriomyces zelleri before switching the genus later that year to Boletus. In 1944, Walter Henry Snell thought the taxon would be more <b>appropriate</b> <b>in</b> the genus Xerocomus. In 1959, mycologists Rolf Singer, Snell and Esther A. Dick transferred the species to Boletellus, explaining that the microstructure of the trama and the faint ornamentation of the spores were inconsistent with placement in Xerocomus. American mycologist Harry D. Thiers, in his 1976 monograph on North American boletes, claimed that he failed to consistently find ornamentation on the spores of material he collected, and preferred to retain the species in Boletus. In 2011, it was moved to the genus Xerocomellus.|$|E

5|$|Fay Michael Peter v. Public Prosecutor (1994) {{concerned}} an American teenager, Michael P. Fay, who {{was arrested}} in 1994 for vandalizing cars and stealing street signs. He pleaded guilty to two charges of vandalizing by spraying paint {{on a number of}} cars. On conviction by a subordinate court, he was sentenced to a total of four months' imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. For the purposes of sentencing, other charges were taken into consideration, including 16 charges of vandalism involving paint. Fay appealed to the High Court against the sentences, arguing that (a) proviso to section 3 of the Vandalism Act required the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the indelible quality of the paint used before caning could be imposed; (b) a probation order was <b>appropriate</b> <b>in</b> this case; and (c) the trial judge below should have ordered a pre-sentencing report with a view to ordering probation. The appeal was dismissed. The case generated intense media interest in the United States, culminating in a formal request from the US Government for the caning sentence not to be carried out. The Singapore Government rejected the request on the basis that foreigners in Singapore could not be held to a different standard from citizens. However, it recommended that the President reduce the caning from six strokes to four.|$|E
5|$|Seoul unit {{director}} Dan Glass and Jim Mitchell {{were the}} visual effects supervisors {{of the first}} season. The season had a total VFX shot count of about 1200. An in-house VFX team was established in Chicago which completed over 700 shots. The major external VFX vendors were Locktix VFX (160-180 shots), Technicolor VFX (over 100 shots) and Encore VFX. Additional work was done by Studio 8 FX, Trace VFX and Almost Gold. Because of the series' tight budget and timeline the production {{made the decision to}} do most of the effects in-camera and only enhance them digitally where <b>appropriate.</b> <b>In</b> fact for a great number of shots which involved the sensates communicating and visiting each other telepathically the cast were simply moving {{in and out of the}} frame in timely fashion requiring no additional work. According to Glass, most of the VFX work that was done is invisible in the final show and consisted mostly of split-screens, crew and rig removal, weather augmentation and screen inserts. Executive producer Grant Hill commented he would be impressed if one would be able to recognize as many as 150 of the 1200 VFX shots, because most of them consisted of small things used to help the narrative, and they do not call attention to themselves. Of the more visible work done, Glass provided the examples of age manipulation of actors, dramatic enhancement of the weather in the car scenes in Iceland, a few greenscreens, and computer generated blades, blood and wounds.|$|E
5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates {{that when}} Kali (Satyavati) was {{ferrying}} the rishi (sage) Parashara {{across the river}} Yamuna, the sage wanted Kali to satisfy his lust and held her right hand. She tried to dissuade Parashara, saying that a learned Brahmin of his stature should not desire a woman who stinks of fish. She finally gave in, realizing the desperation and persistence of the sage and fearing {{that if she did}} not heed to his request, he might topple the boat midstream. Kali agreed, and told Parashara to be patient until the boat reached the bank. On reaching the other side the sage grabbed her again, but she declared that her body stank and coitus should be delightful to them both. At these words, Matsyagandha was transformed (by the powers of the sage) into Yojanagandha ("she whose fragrance can be smelled from across a yojana"). She now smelled of musk, and so was called Kasturi-gandhi ("musk-fragrant"). When Parashara, tormented with desire, approached her again she insisted that the act was not <b>appropriate</b> <b>in</b> broad daylight, as her father and others would see them in sex from the other bank; they should wait till night. The sage, with his powers, shrouded the entire area in fog. Before Parashara could enjoy her, Satyavati again interrupted him to say that he would enjoy her and depart, robbing her of her virginity and leaving her shamed in society. The sage then blessed her with virgo intacta. She asked Parashara to promise her that the coitus would be a secret and her virginity intact; the son born from their union would be as famous as the great sage; and her fragrance and youth would be eternal. Parashara granted her these wishes and was satiated by the beautiful Satyavati. After the act, the sage bathed in the river and left, never to meet her again. The Mahabharata abridges the story, noting only two wishes for Satyavati: her virgo intacta and everlasting sweet fragrance.|$|E
