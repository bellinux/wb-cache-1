5|$|As {{told in the}} Kurma Purana, Bhikshatana-Shiva {{wanted to}} reveal the ignorance of the sages, who were engrossed in Dharma (righteousness) and extreme austerities but had {{forgotten}} the Samkhya (Supreme Knowledge). The naked, handsome, ithyphallic (with an erect phallus, urdhvalinga) beggar Shiva entered the forest, begging for alms from the sages' wives. They were so enamoured of him that while granting alms, they allowed their clothes to fall off and followed him, dancing and singing, love-sick. Bhikshatana was accompanied by Mohini‚ÄîVishnu disguised as Bhikshatana's enchanting wife, who maddens the sages' sons in love. The sages, unable to recognise Shiva, abused and cursed him, even assaulting him. They cursed that his Linga (phallus) should fall off. Shiva allowed it to be so and the Linga became an infinite fiery pillar of light. Anusuya, the wife of sage Atri, enlightened the sages that the couple {{was none other than}} Shiva and Vishnu. The sages thereafter worshipped the Linga. Pleased, Shiva returned to the forest as a beggar in an ugly form with his wife Parvati. Eventually, he revealed his supreme form to the sages and exalted the Pashupata vow ‚Äì by which a man restrains his passion, becomes celibate, and roams naked smeared with ash ‚Äì declaring that such <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> would lead to moksha (salvation).|$|E
5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Both {{genetic and}} {{lifestyle}} {{factors contribute to}} individual-level risk of coronary artery disease. The extent to which increased genetic risk can be offset by <b>a</b> healthy <b>lifestyle</b> is unknown. METHODS Using a polygenic score of DNA sequence polymorphisms, we quantified genetic risk for coronary artery disease in three prospective cohorts - 7814 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, 21, 222 in the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS), and 22, 389 in the Malm√∂ Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS) - And in 4260 participants in the cross-sectional BioImage Study for whom genotype and covariate data were available. We also determined adherence to <b>a</b> healthy <b>lifestyle</b> among the participants using a scoring system consisting of four factors: no current smoking, no obesity, regular physical activity, and a healthy diet. RESULTS The relative risk of incident coronary events was 91 % higher among participants at high genetic risk (top quintile of polygenic scores) than among those at low genetic risk (bottom quintile of polygenic scores) (hazard ratio, 1. 91; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 75 to 2. 09). <b>A</b> favorable <b>lifestyle</b> (defined as {{at least three of}} the four healthy lifestyle factors) was associated with a substantially lower risk of coronary events than <b>an</b> unfavorable <b>lifestyle</b> (defined as no or only one healthy lifestyle factor), regardless of the genetic risk category. Among participants at high genetic risk, <b>a</b> favorable <b>lifestyle</b> was associated with a 46 % lower relative risk of coronary events than <b>an</b> unfavorable <b>lifestyle</b> (hazard ratio, 0. 54; 95 % CI, 0. 47 to 0. 63). This finding corresponded to a reduction in the standardized 10 -year incidence of coronary events from 10. 7 % for <b>an</b> unfavorable <b>lifestyle</b> to 5. 1 % for <b>a</b> favorable <b>lifestyle</b> in ARIC, from 4. 6 % to 2. 0 % in WGHS, and from 8. 2 % to 5. 3 % in MDCS. In the BioImage Study, <b>a</b> favorable <b>lifestyle</b> was associated with significantly less coronary-artery calcification within each genetic risk category. CONCLUSIONS Across four studies involving 55, 685 participants, genetic and lifestyle factors were independently associated with susceptibility to coronary artery disease. Among participants at high genetic risk, <b>a</b> favorable <b>lifestyle</b> was associated with a nearly 50 % lower relative risk of coronary artery disease than was <b>an</b> unfavorable <b>lifestyle...</b>|$|R
