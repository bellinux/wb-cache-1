40|$|PURPOSE. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the suppressive effects of <b>antithrombin</b> (AT) <b>III</b> on inflammatory reactions during endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats by studying leukocyte–endothelium interactions.

Its suppressive effects on inflammatory leukocyte behavior were evaluated in vivo with acridine orange digital fluorography. Clinical signs of inflammation were also examined, and aqueous humor (AH) was collected to evaluate leukocyte infiltration and protein leakage. In a separate experiment, P-selectin mRNA expression was studied in the iris-ciliary body (ICB) and the retina. RESULTS.

25|$|Pregnancy-induced {{hypercoagulability}} {{is probably}} a physiologically adaptive mechanism to prevent post partum hemorrhage. Pregnancy changes the plasma levels of many clotting factors, such as fibrinogen, which can rise up to three times its normal value. Thrombin levels increase. Protein S, an anticoagulant, decreases. However, the other major anticoagulants, protein C and <b>antithrombin</b> <b>III,</b> remain constant. Fibrinolysis is impaired {{by an increase in}} plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1 or PAI) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2), the latter synthesized from the placenta.

Milder rare congenital thrombophilias are factor XIII mutation and familial dysfibrinogenemia (an abnormal fibrinogen). It is unclear whether congenital disorders of fibrinolysis (the system that destroys clots) are major contributors to thrombosis risk. Congenital deficiency of plasminogen, for instance, mainly causes eye symptoms and sometimes problems in other organs, but the link with thrombosis has been more uncertain.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Information {{about the}} {{antithrombin}} 111 -heparin interaction is deduced from the following: (i) structure-activity studies of various synthetic analogues of the antithrombin I 11 binding pentasaccharide domain of heparin, which revealed that essential sulfate and carboxylate substituents are located at {{opposite sides of}} the pentasaccharide molecule; (ii) studies that designated the heparin-binding amino acid residues of <b>antithrombin</b> 111; (<b>iii)</b> a molecular model of antithrombin 111, constructed {{on the basis of the}} crystal structure of a 1 -antitrypsin. From these studies it could be deduced that both the protein and the carbohydrate display an asymmetric assembly of essential interaction points.

40|$|Liver {{diseases}} {{are associated with}} complex haemostasis defects, in which platelets, coagulation, and fibrinolysis may all be affected. The low plasma concentrations of clotting factors often found can {{be the result of}} many changes such as impaired synthesis, increased catabolism due to intravascular coagulation, or alternate distribution. In this study, we investigated the metabolism of purified human <b>antithrombin</b> III(AT <b>III)</b> labelled with 125 I in 25 patients with histologically established liver disease and in nine control subjects. The results showed that, in general, low plasma concentrations of AT III in liver cirrhosis are not due to consumption in the central compartment but rather to altered transcapillary flux ratio. Such altered transcapillary flux ratios may already exist even with normal plasma AT III concentrations. Altered ratios are not only found for coagulation proteins but also for albumin and thus may be a general phenomenon of liver disease.

40|$|Inherited thrombophilia is {{believed}} to be a multiple gene disease with more than one defect. We aimed to determine the association between single thrombophilic patterns and a variety of pregnancy diseases. 284 pregnant women were recruited for the present study and were divided in two groups: A group (176 controls) and B group (108 cases). Patients belonging to the B group had one of the following: severe pre-eclampsia, hemolysis, hepatic enzymes increase, hypertension and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome, gestational hypertension, fetal growth restriction, intrauterine death, abruptio placentae and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. To detect methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) A 1298 C, MTHFR C 677 T, factor V Leiden, PAI- 1, mutant prothrombin G 20210 A, an inverse hybridization technology was used. Plasma homocysteine, <b>antithrombin</b> (AT) <b>III</b> and protein S were determined. A modified functional activated protein C resistance was detected. MTHFR C 677 T and hyperhomocysteinemia were more prevalent than other thrombophilias. Deficiency in AT III was significantly linked with pre-eclampsia (relative risk 0. 88; 95 % CI 0. 83 - 0. 94). Activated protein C resistance (APCR) was significantly related to the abruptio placentae (relative risk 0. 71; 95 % CI 0. 61 - 0. 82). Apart from the linkage between AT III deficiency and the occurrence of pre-eclampsia, and apart from the increased risk of abruptio placentae in pregnant women with altered APCR, we obtained findings in contrast with some of the published literature.

40|$|Aim: Cholestasis is {{associated}} with increased morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing major liver surgery. An additional risk is induced when vascular inflow occlusion is applied giving rise to liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The role of the coagulation system {{in this type of}} injury is elusive. The aim of the current study was to assess activation of coagulation following hepatic I/R injury in cholestatic rats. Methods: Male Wistar rats were randomized into two groups and subjected to bile duct ligation (BDL) or sham laparotomy. After 7 days, both groups underwent 30 min partial liver ischemia. Animals were sacrificed before ischemia or after 6 h, 24 h, and 48 h reperfusion. Results: Plasma AST and ALT levels were higher after I/R in cholestatic rats (P < 0. 05). Hepatic necrosis, liver wet/dry ratio and neutrophil influx were increased in the BDL group up to 48 h reperfusion (P < 0. 05). Liver synthetic function was decreased in the BDL group as reflected by prolonged prothrombin time after 6 h and 24 h reperfusion (P < 0. 05). I/R in cholestatic rats resulted in a 12 -fold vs. 7 -fold (P < 0. 01) increase in markers for thrombin generation and a 6 -fold vs. 2 -fold (P < 0. 01) increase in fibrin degradation products (BDL vs. control, respectively). In addition, the cholestatic rats exhibited significantly decreased levels of <b>antithrombin</b> (AT) <b>III</b> and increased levels of the fibrinolytic inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI- 1) during reperfusion.

The u-PA level was markedly increased in plasma of sepsis patients as compared to non-sepsis patients (11. 5 +/- 9. 4 versus 1. 6 +/- 1. 5 ng/ml, p less than 0. 0001). PAI- 1 antigen and t-PA activity showed a significant increase in sepsis patients (320 +/- 390 ng/ml versus 120 +/- 200 ng/ml, and 3. 0 +/- 3. 6 IU/ml versus 1. 0 +/- 0. 7 IU/ml, respectively, p less than 0. 01). AT III was decreased in sepsis patients (58 +/- 28 % in sepsis versus 79 +/- 26 % in severe infectious disease, p less than 0. 01) as was protein C (30 +/- 18 % versus 58 +/- 27 %, p less than 0. 001). No significant difference was found for t-PA antigen nor for PAI activity. Nonsurvivors of sepsis were distinguished mainly by a high u-PA antigen level and increased t-PA activity. It is concluded that plasma u-PA antigen showed the strongest significant difference, among the parameters evaluated, between sepsis and severe infection. u-PA antigen may be of prognostic value in patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit for severe infectious disease. status: publishe...|$|R

DESIGN: Part 1 : double blind randomized trial for 3 months. Part 2 : open study for 9 months. SETTING: Department of Endocrinology, University Hospital, Malmo, Sweden. SUBJECTS: Fifty-one postmenopausal women {{with a history of}} amenorrhoea of at least 6 months and body mass index > or = 24 kg m- 2 participated in part 1 and 46 participated in part 2. INTERVENTION: Randomization for placebo (n= 24) or HRT (n= 27). HRT was given as 2 mg oestradiol valerate for the first 3 months, with the addition of 10 mg medroxyprogesterone for 10 days every third month thereafter. MEASUREMENTS: At baseline and after 3 and 12 months. RESULTS: During 0 - 3 months in the HRT group, FVII increased (P < 0. 01), whereas fibrinogen, AT III and total protein S all decreased (P < 0. 001 for all). Changes in variables were expressed as Delta-values. After 3 months Delta-values differed between groups for fibrinogen (P < 0. 05), AT III (P < 0. 001), total protein S (P < 0. 001), and PAI- 1 (P < 0. 001). During 0 - 12 months, fibrinogen, total protein S, tPA (P < 0. 01 for all) and AT III (P < 0. 05) decreased. In the control group, all variables were unchanged during the study, except for increases (P < 0. 05) in total protein S after 3 and 12 months, and a decrease (P < 0. 01) in FVIII after 12 months. After 12 months Delta-values differed for fibrinogen (P < 0. 05), AT III (P < 0. 05) and total protein S (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Unopposed oestrogen substitution was associated with both potentially beneficial effects, such as decreases in fibrinogen, and potentially thrombogenic effects such as decreasing AT III and protein S and increasing FVII. During prolonged follow-up and addition of progesterone, differences between groups concerning FVII were attenuated.

40|$|Human plasma kallikrein is inactivated by plasma {{protease}} inhibitors. This {{study was}} designed to determine the nature of these protease inhibitors and to assess their relative importance in the inactivation of kallikrein. Therefore, the kinetics of kallikrein inactivation and the formation of kallikrein inhibitor complexes were studied in normal plasma and in plasma depleted of either alpha 2 -macroglobulin (alpha 2 M), C 1 inhibitor, or <b>antithrombin</b> (AT <b>III).</b> Prekallikrein was activated by incubation of plasma with dextran sulfate at 4 degrees C. After maximal activation, kallikrein was inactivated at 37 degrees C. Inhibition of kallikrein amidolytic activity in AT III-deficient plasma closely paralleled the inactivation rate of kallikrein in normal plasma. The inactivation rate of kallikrein in alpha 2 M-deficient plasma was slightly decreased compared with normal plasma, but in contrast to normal, C 1 inhibitor-deficient, and AT III-deficient plasma, no kallikrein amidolytic activity remained after inactivation that was resistant to inhibition by soybean trypsin inhibitor. Suppression of kallikrein activity in C 1 inhibitor-deficient plasma was markedly decreased, and this was even more pronounced in plasma deficient in both C 1 inhibitor and alpha 2 M. The pseudo first-order rate constants for kallikrein inactivation in normal, AT III-deficient, alpha 2 M-deficient, C 1 inhibitor-deficient plasma, and plasma deficient in both alpha 2 M and C 1 inhibitor, were 0. 68, 0. 60, 0. 43, 0. 07, and 0. 016 min- 1, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gradient polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis showed that during inactivation of kallikrein in plasma, high-Mr complexes were formed with Mr at 400, 000 - 1, 000, 000, 185, 000, and 125, 000 - 135, 000, which were identified as complexes of 125 I-kallikrein with alpha 2 M, C 1 inhibitor, and AT III, respectively. In addition, the presence of an unidentified kallikrein-inhibitor complex was observed in AT III-deficient plasma. 52 % of the 125 I-kallikrein was associated with C 1 -inhibitor, 35 % with alpha 2 M, and 13 % with AT III and another protease inhibitor. A similar distribution of 125 I-kallikrein was observed when the 125 I-kallikrein inhibitor complexes were removed from plasma by immunoadsorption with insolubilized anti-C 1 inhibitor, anti-alpha 2 M, or anti-AT III antibodies. These results suggest that only covalent complexes are formed between kallikrein and its inhibitors in plasma. As a function of time, 125 I-kallikrein formed complexes with C 1 inhibitor at a higher rate than with alpha 2 M. No difference was observed between the inactivation rate of kallikrein in high-Mr kininogen-deficient plasma and that in high-Mr kininogen-deficient plasma reconstituted with high-Mr kininogen; this suggests that high-Mr kininogen does not protect kallikrein from inactivation in the plasma milieu. These results have quantitatively demonstrated the major roles of C 1 inhibitor and alpha 2 M in the inactivation of kallikrein in plasma...|$|R
