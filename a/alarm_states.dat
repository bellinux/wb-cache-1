50|$|These <b>alarm</b> <b>states</b> {{are also}} lumped under the term Carrier Group Alarm (CGA). The meaning of CGA is that {{connectivity}} on the digital carrier has failed. The {{result of the}} CGA condition varies depending on the equipment function. Voice equipment typically coerces the robbed bits for signaling to a state {{that will result in}} the far end properly handling the condition, while applying an often different state to the customer equipment connected to the alarmed equipment. Simultaneously, the customer data is often coerced to a 0x7F pattern, signifying a zero-voltage condition on voice equipment. Data equipment usually passes whatever data may be present, if any, leaving it to the customer equipment to deal with the condition.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a motion}} {{recognition}} scheme using acceleration sensor of smart devices is proposed and is experimentally analyzed with a server. Sensor data of 3 -axis acceleration of a smart device is collected and 2 nd order Butterworth {{low pass filter}} (LPF) is applied to reduce noise. With the collected sensor data, the various motions such as falling, sitting, lying and walking are distinguished one another. Based on the fixed threshold by the probability approach, falling motion is especially distinguished from other motions {{as an indication of}} emergency situation. A server displays current states and <b>alarm</b> <b>states.</b> The proposed scheme is evaluated through experiments. The results of experiments show that the accuracy of motion recognition is more than 94 % in all the motions. As for a falling recognition, the accuracy is 96 %...|$|E

40|$|Functions Virtualisation (NFV) and Software Driven Networks (SDN) {{aggregate}} resources {{across multiple}} domains. This puts requirements on understanding the overall alarm status across these domains and dependencies between them. Current practice of low-quality alarm documentation and confusion around fundamental concepts like <b>alarm</b> <b>states,</b> alarm-types {{and the underlying}} protocols like syslog and SNMP traps {{makes it hard to}} create one unified alarm interface as part of the SDN API. If alarm interfaces for the various components were expressed in a more formal manner including dependencies and propagation between the alarms the NFV/SDN interface could automatically present an integrated alarm API as well as a synthesized alarm state across the virtualized functions. We present a novel approach to alarm interfaces by providing a formal alarm model together with a domain-specific language that allows us to specify both the alarm models and the constraints placed on the alarm models in a consistent manner. This means that we can verify the consistency of an alarm interfaces and automatically generate interfaces, multi-domain correlation and aggregated states. Godkänd; 2014; 20140110 (stewal...|$|E
40|$|Tubing (especially venous) disconnections using pumped devices cause {{significant}} hemorrhage, {{and current}} monitoring techniques are imperfect because {{they rely on}} intraluminal pressure changes. We devised a passive detection method based on a patient's electrical voltages being transmitted via blood tubing to our alarm circuit. As the arterial and venous access sites are in close proximity, the signals are nearly identical during connection, and markedly different with disconnection. We built a prototype and tested it in vitro with saline and during hemodialysis treatments (n= 7). The connection status is determined by examining the difference between endogenous voltages in the blood tubing from and to the patient, and when it exceeds a threshold an alarm condition is triggered. We tested for possible confounding by an electrical shunt through the dialyzer and determined that pathway had an impedance approximately three times (> 350 [*]kΩ) that of the tubing to the patient. As the roller blood-pump periodically occluded the tubing, the resultant intermittent very high impedance prevented that potential shunting problem and improved the sensitivity of our device. Disconnections were detectable at various bloodline sites (needles, sampling ports, drip chambers). Thus, the circuit's sensors can be placed remotely at the dialysis machine, with electrical continuity to blood made by inexpensive conductive elements at the tubing wall or drip chambers. Appropriate threshold and noise-eliminating circuitry, as well as <b>alarm</b> <b>states</b> that alert the staff and stop the blood pump, make our prototype a promising low-cost safety enhancement...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of a particle accelerator or any large machine with users is not only of paramount importance but is also, {{at the end of}} the day, an oft quoted number (0 to 100 %) which represents (or is taken to represent) the overall health of the facility in question. When a single number can somehow reflect on the maintenance, operation, and engineering of the machine, it is important to know how this number was obtained. In almost all cases, the officially quoted availability is generated by hand by a machine coordinator, who peruses the operation statistics over the period in question. And when humans are involved in such a calculation there might be a latent tendency to avoid the stigma of low availability. So, not only might there be scepticism at 'impossibly high' availability, but comparing quoted availability from one machine with another might turn out to be virtually meaningless. In this paper we present a method for calculating the machine availability automatically, based on the known (and archived) machine states and the known (and archived) <b>alarm</b> <b>states</b> of the machine. Ideally this is sufficient for a completely automatic determination of the availability. This requires, however, a perfect representation of all possible machine states and a perfect representation of all possible fatal alarms (those leading to down time). As achieving perfection is ever an ongoing affair, the ability for a human to 'post-correct' the automated statistics is also described...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRedundant {{techniques}} are widely adopted in vehicle management computer (VMC) {{to ensure that}} VMC has high reliability and safety. At the same time, it makes VMC have special characteristics, e. g., failure correlation, event simultaneity, and failure self-recovery. Accordingly, the reliability and safety analysis to redundant VMC system (RVMCS) becomes more difficult. Aimed at the difficulties in RVMCS reliability modeling, this paper adopts generalized stochastic Petri nets to establish the reliability and safety models of RVMCS. Then this paper analyzes RVMCS operating states and potential threats to flight control system. It is verified by simulation that the reliability of VMC is not the product of hardware reliability and software reliability, and the interactions between hardware and software faults can reduce the real reliability of VMC obviously. Furthermore, the failure undetected <b>states</b> and false <b>alarming</b> <b>states</b> inevitably exist in RVMCS due to the influences of limited fault monitoring coverage and false alarming probability of fault monitoring devices (FMD). RVMCS operating in some failure undetected states will produce fatal threats {{to the safety of}} flight control system. RVMCS operating in some false <b>alarming</b> <b>states</b> will reduce utility of RVMCS obviously. The results abstracted in this paper can guide reliable VMC and efficient FMD designs.

The system is trained on a normal data set, with no prior information about the scene under surveillance, thereby requiring minimal user input. Nodes use a trace activation rule and feedforward connections, modified so that higher layer nodes are sensitive to trajectory segments traced across the previous layer. Top layer nodes have binary lateral connections and corresponding “novelty accumulator ” nodes. Lateral connections are set between co-occurring nodes, generating a signal to prevent accumulation of the novelty measure along normal sequences. In abnormal sequences the novelty accumulator nodes are allowed to increase their activity, generating an <b>alarm</b> <b>state.</b> ...|$|R
