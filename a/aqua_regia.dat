50|$|<b>Aquae</b> <b>Regiae</b> was a Roman {{town in the}} Roman {{province}} of Byzacena, during the Roman Empire and into late antiquity. The Latin adjective referring to it is Aquaregiensis.|$|R
5|$|Scheele {{observed}} {{several of}} the properties of chlorine: the bleaching effect on litmus, the deadly effect on insects, the yellow-green color, and the smell similar to <b>aqua</b> <b>regia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bismuth was {{purchased}} from the American Smelting and Refining Company {{of the highest}} purity that it could produce. It was sent to Hanford, where it was put in aluminum cans, and placed inside a reactor for 100 days. The canned slugs then shipped to Unit IV, where they were bathed in hydrochloric acid, which dissolved the aluminum. This formed an aluminum chloride solution that was disposed of, as it was highly radioactive due to iron and copper in the aluminum alloy. The bismuth slugs were then dissolved in <b>aqua</b> <b>regia.</b> This was too weak for electroplating the polonium, so the nitric acid was removed, and then the polonium deposited on bismuth by adding powdered bismuth. This resulted in a 100–1 concentration. This could then be repeated by dissolving in <b>aqua</b> <b>regia</b> again to achieve a 1000–1 concentration. This was again dissolved, and the polonium electroplated on platinum foils. The main problem with the process was that it required glass-lined containers due to the <b>aqua</b> <b>regia,</b> and mechanisms for safe handling of the radioactive material. The Dayton Project explored alternative purification methods that {{were found to be}} workable, but less efficient or safe.|$|E
5|$|Titanium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It is a lustrous transition metal {{with a silver}} color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to corrosion in sea water, <b>aqua</b> <b>regia,</b> and chlorine.|$|E
50|$|Monsignor Evans was {{appointed}} Titular Bishop of <b>Aquae</b> <b>Regiae</b> and Auxiliary to the Bishop of the Diocese of Providence on October 15, 2009 by Benedict XVI. He was consecrated a bishop on December 15, 2009.|$|R
50|$|The Roman Martyrology {{states that}} four other wealthy merchants were martyred {{on the same}} day as Victorian's death. Two were named Frumentius; they were merchants of Carthage. The other two were {{brothers}} of the city of <b>Aquae</b> <b>Regiae,</b> Byzacena, who were killed at Tabaia.|$|R
50|$|On March 17, 1964 Pope Paul VI {{appointed}} {{him as the}} Titular Bishop of <b>Aquae</b> <b>Regiae</b> and Auxiliary Bishop of Washington. He was consecrated a bishop by Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi, the Apostolic Delegate to the United States, on May 19, 1964. The principal co-consecrators were Archbishops Patrick O'Boyle of Washington and Joseph McGucken of San Francisco. McDonald attended {{the third and fourth}} sessions of the Second Vatican Council in 1964 and 1965. Three years after his episcopal consecration Pope Paul {{appointed him}} to be an auxiliary bishop in San Francisco.|$|R
5|$|Iridium is {{the most}} {{corrosion-resistant}} metal known: it is not attacked by almost any acid, <b>aqua</b> <b>regia,</b> molten metals, or silicates at high temperatures. It can, however, be attacked by some molten salts, such as sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide, as well as oxygen and the halogens (particularly fluorine) at higher temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium {{is found}} in {{platinum}} or nickel ores together with {{the other members of}} the platinum group metals. It was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston in one such ore, and named for the rose color of one of its chlorine compounds, produced after it reacted with the powerful acid mixture <b>aqua</b> <b>regia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chemists {{who studied}} {{platinum}} dissolved it in <b>aqua</b> <b>regia</b> (a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids) to create soluble salts. They always observed {{a small amount}} of a dark, insoluble residue. Joseph Louis Proust thought that the residue was graphite. The French chemists Victor Collet-Descotils, Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin also observed the black residue in 1803, but did not obtain enough for further experiments.|$|E
50|$|The ruins at Menadla {{date from}} the Roman Empire and are {{tentatively}} identified as a station on the Roman Road from Althiburos(Dahmani) To Thysdrus(El Djem) called Terento, {{though there is a}} suggestion the town was named Forontoniana, has also be proposed. The ruins are tentatively identified with a Roman town of the Roman province of Byzacene, called Terento. The town appears on the Tabula Peutingeria, and according to the Antonine Itinerary it was on the Roman Road from Althiburos To Thysdrus. about 10 miles from <b>Aquae</b> <b>Regiae</b> The Antonine Itinery tells us that its neighbors were Germanieiana, tentatively identified with nearby Ksour-el-Maïete and Aeliae thought by some to be nearby Henchir-Merelma. If these tentatively identifications are correct it would confirm the Antonine Itinerary description of them being way stations on the limes Africana Road.|$|R
5|$|It {{was named}} by Wollaston in 1802 after the {{asteroid}} 2 Pallas, {{which had been}} discovered two months earlier. Wollaston found palladium in crude platinum ore from South America by dissolving the ore in <b>aqua</b> <b>regia,</b> neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide, and precipitating platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate with ammonium chloride. He added mercuric cyanide to form the compound palladium(II) cyanide, which was heated to extract palladium metal.|$|E
5|$|Mercury {{does not}} react with most acids, such as dilute sulfuric acid, {{although}} oxidizing acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid or <b>aqua</b> <b>regia</b> dissolve it to give sulfate, nitrate, and chloride. Like silver, mercury reacts with atmospheric hydrogen sulfide. Mercury reacts with solid sulfur flakes, {{which are used}} in mercury spill kits to absorb mercury (spill kits also use activated carbon and powdered zinc).|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{compounds}} have a {{very long}} history, ammonium chloride having been known to Herodotus. They were well known by the Middle Ages. Alchemists knew nitric acid as aqua fortis (strong water), {{as well as other}} nitrogen compounds such as ammonium salts and nitrate salts. The mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids was known as <b>aqua</b> <b>regia</b> (royal water), celebrated for its ability to dissolve gold, the king of metals.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is a soft silver-white {{metal that}} resembles {{platinum}}. It {{is the least}} dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals. It is soft and ductile when annealed and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold-worked. Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid, in hot, concentrated sulfuric acid, and when finely ground, in hydrochloric acid. It dissolves readily at room temperature in <b>aqua</b> <b>regia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carl von Sickingen {{researched}} platinum {{extensively in}} 1772. He {{succeeded in making}} malleable platinum by alloying it with gold, dissolving the alloy in hot <b>aqua</b> <b>regia,</b> precipitating the platinum with ammonium chloride, igniting the ammonium chloroplatinate, and hammering the resulting finely divided platinum to make it cohere. Franz Karl Achard made the first platinum crucible in 1784. He worked with the platinum by fusing it with arsenic, then later volatilizing the arsenic.|$|E
5|$|In April 1940, {{early in}} the Second World War, Nazi Germany invaded and {{occupied}} Denmark. To prevent the Germans from discovering Max von Laue's and James Franck's gold Nobel medals, Bohr had de Hevesy dissolve them in <b>aqua</b> <b>regia.</b> In this form, they were stored on a shelf at the Institute until after the war, when the gold was precipitated and the medals re-struck by the Nobel Foundation. Bohr kept the Institute running, but all the foreign scholars departed.|$|E
5|$|In many ways, Niobium {{is similar}} to {{tantalum}} and zirconium. It reacts with most nonmetals at high temperatures; with fluorine at room temperature; with chlorine and hydrogen at 200°C; and with nitrogen at 400°C, with products that are frequently interstitial and nonstoichiometric. The metal begins to oxidize in air at 200°C. It resists corrosion by fused alkalis and by acids, including <b>aqua</b> <b>regia,</b> hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric and phosphoric acids. Niobium is attacked by hydrofluoric acid and hydrofluoric/nitric acid mixtures.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium is a hard, silvery, durable {{metal that}} has a high reflectance. Rhodium metal does not {{normally}} form an oxide, even when heated. Oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere only at the melting point of rhodium, but is released on solidification. Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum. It is not attacked by most acids: it is completely insoluble in nitric acid and dissolves slightly in <b>aqua</b> <b>regia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Iridium is also {{obtained}} commercially as {{a by-product}} from nickel and copper mining and processing. During electrorefining of copper and nickel, noble metals such as silver, gold and the platinum group metals {{as well as}} selenium and tellurium settle {{to the bottom of}} the cell as anode mud, which forms the starting point for their extraction. To separate the metals, they must first be brought into solution. Several separation methods are available depending on the nature of the mixture; two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in <b>aqua</b> <b>regia,</b> and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is dark (blue-gray), dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, {{and highly}} {{conductive}} {{of heat and}} electricity. The metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids; in fact, at temperatures below 150°C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive <b>aqua</b> <b>regia.</b> It can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide, {{as well as with}} a solution of potassium hydroxide. Tantalum's high melting point of 3017°C (boiling point 5458°C) is exceeded among the elements only by tungsten, rhenium and osmium for metals, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|Technetium {{is located}} in the seventh group of the {{periodic}} table, between rhenium and manganese. As predicted by the periodic law, its chemical properties are between those two elements. Of the two, technetium more closely resembles rhenium, particularly in its chemical inertness and tendency to form covalent bonds. Unlike manganese, technetium does not readily form cations (ions with a net positive charge). Technetium exhibits nine oxidation states from −1 to +7, with +4, +5, and +7 being the most common. Technetium dissolves in <b>aqua</b> <b>regia,</b> nitric acid, and concentrated sulfuric acid, but it is not soluble in hydrochloric acid of any concentration.|$|E
5|$|One {{suitable}} {{method for}} purification for the raw platinum, which contains platinum, gold, {{and the other}} platinum-group metals, is to process it with <b>aqua</b> <b>regia,</b> in which palladium, gold and platinum are dissolved, whereas osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium stay unreacted. The gold is precipitated {{by the addition of}} iron(II) chloride and after filtering off the gold, the platinum is precipitated as ammonium chloroplatinate by the addition of ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloroplatinate can be converted to platinum by heating. Unprecipitated hexachloroplatinate(IV) may be reduced with elemental zinc, and a similar method is suitable for small scale recovery of platinum from laboratory residues. Mining and refining platinum has environmental impacts.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{compound}} of chlorine, sodium chloride, {{has been known}} since ancient times; archaeologists have found evidence that rock salt was used as early as 3000 BC and brine as early as 6000 BC. Its importance in food was very well known in classical antiquity and was sometimes used as payment for services for Roman generals and military tribunes. Elemental chlorine was probably first isolated around 1200 {{with the discovery of}} <b>aqua</b> <b>regia</b> and its ability to dissolve gold, since chlorine gas is one of the products of this reaction: it was however not recognised as a new substance. Around 1630, chlorine was recognized as a gas by the Flemish chemist and physician Jan Baptist van Helmont.|$|E
5|$|Franck found a {{position}} at the Polytekniske Læreanstalt in Copenhagen for Arthur von Hippel, who was now his son in law, having married his daughter Dagmar. He decided to provide financial security for his children by dividing his Nobel Prize money between them. The gold medal itself was entrusted to Niels Bohr for safekeeping. When Germany invaded Denmark on 9 April 1940, the Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy dissolved the gold medal, along with that of Max von Laue in <b>aqua</b> <b>regia</b> to prevent the Germans from taking them. He placed the resulting solution on a shelf in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then recast the Nobel Prize medals.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the ship}} Virginia Maid arrives in England from the New World, {{carrying}} the young Virginia Dare, {{the first child}} born in Roanoke colony, {{as well as her}} hulking, fair-skinned, blond Native American bodyguard Rojhaz. They are taken to meet the Queen only for a vulture-like assassin to snatch Virginia. Rojhaz quickly disables the attacker, but Virginia has transformed into a white gryphon. Rojhaz subdues Virginia, and Stephen Strange bespells her to human form before Fury sees her transformed. She has strange shapeshifting powers, and Strange suspects she is the cause of the disastrous weather. Fury interrogates one of the assassins to learn who sent him. He is told that it is Otto von Doom, ruler of Latveria, but Fury is too late to stop one of Doom's machines from killing Elizabeth with a poison gas released by dropping a pill into <b>aqua</b> <b>regia.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2004–05, {{researchers}} from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, 268Db, as a fivefold alpha decay {{product of the}} newly created element 115. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow chemical experimentation. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer {{was removed from the}} surface of the target (with dubnium on it), dissolved in <b>aqua</b> <b>regia</b> with tracers and lanthanum carrier, from which precipitated various +3, +4, and +5 species on adding ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, in which it was converted to nitrate form then dried on a film and counted. It mostly contained a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, but also a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further at both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium in that experiment appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and not even once in niobium-only fractions. However, it was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium.|$|E
5|$|The recoil {{momentum}} of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically {{far away from the}} einsteinium target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum. This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation, which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target. The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined. The mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other fission products by applying acid to the foil and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride, then using a cation-exchange resin column with a 10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid, acting as an eluant. However, if the foil is made of gold and thin enough, it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in <b>aqua</b> <b>regia</b> before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion-exchange chromatography, the eluant being 6Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aqua</b> <b>regia</b> {{was also}} used for parting. It was made by adding sal {{ammoniac}} to nitric acid which produced a mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid. This acid dissolved the gold to a soluble chloride and the silver was attacked and precipitated as an insoluble chloride. Silver was removed by filtering and gold was then recovered by evaporating the liquid and heating the residue. Nitric acid was suitable for separating small quantities of gold from silver and <b>Aqua</b> <b>regia</b> used to separate small quantities of silver from gold. <b>Aqua</b> <b>regia</b> acid process is used by refiners of scrap gold used in jewelry manufacturing. This process is also well suited to recycling consumers' used or broken jewelry directly back onto the global market 24kt inventory.|$|E
25|$|Gold and {{platinum}} {{are extremely}} difficult to oxidize under normal circumstances, and require exposure to a powerful chemical oxidizing agent such as <b>aqua</b> <b>regia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chloroplatinic acid is {{produced}} by dissolving platinum metal sponge in <b>aqua</b> <b>regia.</b> Brownish red crystals can be isolated by evaporating this solution to a syrup.|$|E
