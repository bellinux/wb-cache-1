5|$|Construction {{started in}} November 1996, with the moving of {{underground}} pipes <b>and</b> <b>wires</b> around the station areas. In August 1997, work {{started at the}} depot, and in September, COMET started the first mainline work. In October and November, the two tunnel boring machines (TBM), christened Liva and Bette, were delivered. They started boring each barrel of the tunnel from Islands Brygge in February 1998. The same month, the Public Transport Authority gave the necessary permits to operate a driverless metro. The section between Fasanvej and Frederiksberg is a former S-train line, and was last operated as such on 20 June 1998.|$|E
5|$|In November 1941 the British Eighth Army, {{commanded}} by General Cunningham, launched Operation Crusader {{in an attempt}} to relieve Tobruk. The British XXX Corps, led by the 7th Armoured Division ("the Desert Rats") with its Rhodesian platoons, would form the main body of attack, advancing west from Mersa Matruh, then sweeping around in a north-westerly direction towards Tobruk. The XIII Corps would concurrently advance north-west and cut off Axis forces on the coast at Sollum and Bardia. When signalled the Tobruk garrison would break out and move south-east towards the advancing Allied forces. The operation was largely successful for the Allies, and the siege was broken. The Rhodesians of the LRDG took part in raids on Axis rear areas during the operation, ambushing Axis convoys, destroying Axis aircraft and pulling down telegraph poles <b>and</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|E
5|$|McKellen {{attended}} Bolton School (Boys' Division), {{of which}} he is still a supporter, attending regularly to talk to pupils. McKellen's acting career started at Bolton Little Theatre, {{of which he}} is now the patron. An early fascination with the theatre was encouraged by his parents, who took him on a family outing to Peter Pan at the Opera House in Manchester when he was three. When he was nine, his main Christmas present was a wood and bakelite, fold-away Victorian theatre from Pollocks Toy Theatres, with cardboard scenery <b>and</b> <b>wires</b> to push on the cut-outs of Cinderella and of Laurence Olivier's Hamlet.|$|E

5|$|Mulder uses a {{government}} source {{to find a}} secret T3 line in Fairfax County, Virginia, one that the AI uses to access the Internet. He also finds the trailer that {{is connected to the}} T3 line. Meanwhile, Esther forces Scully to drive to David's house. However, they find that the house has been destroyed. Esther admits that she and David had been planning to transfer their consciousness into cyberspace to enter the AI. Gelman, however, thought the idea was too dangerous. Esther also admits that she and David were in love, and were having an affair behind Gelman's back. Meanwhile, Mulder finds much computer hardware inside the trailer. He also finds David’s dead body, with a virtual reality helmet on his head. Suddenly, Mulder is constrained by moving cables <b>and</b> <b>wires,</b> and experiences a strange vision in which he is in a hospital where nurses threaten to amputate his limbs unless he reveals Kill Switch's location. Meanwhile, the AI locates Scully and Esther driving near a swing bridge. They become trapped on the bridge after the AI manipulates its drawing mechanism, causing Scully to persuade Esther to throw the laptop into the water. Just as it hits the water it is destroyed by the defense satellite's laser strike.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{brought a}} storm surge of 10–12 ft (3–3.5 m) to Tampa Bay. The highest rainfall total in Tampa was at 8.53 in (23.5 mm). However, the observer noted that winds probably blew {{water out of}} the gauge. The barometric pressure fell to , breaking a previous record set in 1910. The hurricane also brought sustained winds of 75 mph (119 km/h) and a storm tide of 10.5 ft (3 m). Damage from the wind was generally minor, while most of the impact wrought by the storm was due to abnormally high tides in Tampa and elsewhere in the area. Much of the city was flooded, with the worst along Bayshore Boulevard, where some of the most expensive properties were located. At Hyde Park, dwellings were inundated about halfway up the first story, prompting several people to be rescued by boat. Electrical poles <b>and</b> <b>wires</b> were washed away near the intersection of Bayshore Boulevard and Howard Avenue. The latter was also left impassible by car. In the Palmetto Beach neighborhood, much of the section was inundated. A group of about 40 volunteers rescued a number of women and children. A total of 50 homes were destroyed by cedar logs used to construct cigar boxes at the Tampa Box Company on 22nd Street.|$|E

30|$|The FlexDex [2] uses a {{flexible}} bending joint <b>and</b> <b>wire</b> drive mechanism [13]. Furthermore, Lee and Chamorro adopted {{a flexible}} bending joint <b>and</b> <b>wire</b> drive mechanism [14]. Hraguchi et al. [15] also proposed a flexible bending joint <b>and</b> <b>wire</b> drive mechanism using a spring for the joint. Bending mechanisms using flexible joints are very simple. The mechanisms of the flexible bending joint <b>and</b> <b>wire</b> are decoupled between the axes. Therefore, many handheld robotic forceps adopt this mechanism. However, since the bending {{radius of the}} flexible joint is large {{with respect to the}} forceps diameter, large motion is required to determine the posture of the end effector. It is difficult to perform procedures in a narrow space when using forceps with a flexible bending joint.|$|R

25|$|The {{first modern}} analog {{computer}} was a tide-predicting machine, invented by Sir William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin, in 1872. It used {{a system of}} pulleys <b>and</b> <b>wires</b> to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location and was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters. His device was the foundation for further developments in analog computing.|$|E
25|$|The numeral {{preceding}} the hyphen indicates the type's particular configuration; {{that is to}} say the number of poles (current-carrying terminals) <b>and</b> <b>wires</b> connected to it, the voltage meant to be used with, and whether for use with single- or three-phase power. A connector with ground terminal is described as having more wires than poles, e.g. two-pole, three-wire; or four-pole, five-wire; etc. A non-grounding device may be two-pole, two-wire; three-pole, three-wire; etc.|$|E
25|$|For larger structures, {{galvanic}} anodes cannot economically deliver enough {{current to}} provide complete protection. Impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) systems use anodes {{connected to a}} DC power source (such as a cathodic protection rectifier). Anodes for ICCP systems are tubular and solid rod shapes of various specialized materials. These include high silicon cast iron, graphite, mixed metal oxide or platinum coated titanium or niobium coated rod <b>and</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|E

25|$|An {{advanced}} {{application of}} DSA is road mapping. From the acquired DSA sequence, the image frame with maximum vessel opification is identified and assigned {{to be the}} so-called road-map mask. This mask is continuously subtracted from live fluoroscopy images to produce real-time subtracted fluoroscopic images overlaid on a static image of the vasculature. The clinical benefit is better visualization of small and complex vascular structures without distracting underlying tissue to support the placement of catheters <b>and</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|E
25|$|No {{one in the}} {{collective}} was experienced with explosives. Terry Robbins and Cathy Wilkerson lacked knowledge even in the basics of electricity. Members worked up a simple circuit without safety features, consisting of a battery, a fuse, a clock, <b>and</b> <b>wires</b> connecting these elements. They inserted dynamite into a one-foot length of water pipe packed with nails. Precisely what went wrong remains uncertain, but the resulting series of blasts in the sub-basement of the townhouse killed those near the bomb and caused {{the collapse of the}} townhouse.|$|E
25|$|A cable tie, {{also known}} as a zip tie or tie-wrap, is a type of fastener, {{especially}} for binding several electronic cables or wires together and to organize cables <b>and</b> <b>wires.</b> They have also been commonly used as makeshift handcuffs, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and in Panama. The cable tie, originally known as the Ty-Rap, was invented in 1958 by Maurus C. Logan, who worked for many years at Thomas & Betts. Logan filed U.S. patent #3,022,557 on June 24, 1958 which was issued to him on February 27, 1962.|$|E

25|$|Much coltan {{from the}} DRC is {{exported}} to China for processing into electronic-grade tantalum powder <b>and</b> <b>wires.</b> Coltan imports from DRC to Europe are usually directed to Central/Eastern Europe and Russia. These cargoes mostly {{travel through the}} route Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Piraeus (Greece), then the Balkans. Nova Dies, an offshore consortium based in British Virgin Islands, mostly controls the trans-Balkan transportation network. This network carries mostly unprocessed coltan mined in uncontrolled artisanal mines, and so it hinders the development of processing infrastructure in DRC. Therefore, this route is a long-term threat for DRC economy.|$|E
