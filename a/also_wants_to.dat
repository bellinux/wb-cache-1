5|$|Marine Le Pen has {{advocated}} that France {{should leave}} the euro (along with Spain, Greece and Portugal). She <b>also</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> reintroduce customs borders and has campaigned against allowing dual citizenship. During both the 2010–2011 Ivorian {{crisis and the}} 2011 Libyan civil war, she opposed the French military involvements. She has recast the party's image towards Israel, after affirming Israel's right to secure itself from terrorism, and criticising the leadership of Iran.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish People's Party of Finland (SPP) is the {{dominant}} party amongst Swedish-speaking voters; a poll has indicated that 75% of them support the party. Led by Stefan Wallin, the party is resolute on preserving the mandatory teaching of Swedish in schools. The SPP <b>also</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> preserve the current immigration laws, which were passed on the initiative of incumbent Minister of Migration Astrid Thors, {{a member of the}} SPP.|$|E
5|$|The party {{believes}} that artists {{should be less}} dependent on public support, and instead be more dependent on making a living on what they create. The party {{believes that}} regular people should rather decide what good culture is, and demands that artists on public support should offer something the audience wants. It <b>also</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> abolish the annual fee for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and privatise the company. Otherwise, the party wants to protect and secure Norwegian cultural heritage.|$|E

5|$|The party {{supports}} {{an increase}} in police forces, and more visible police on the streets. It wants to implement tougher punishments, especially for crime regarding violence and morality offences. The party <b>also</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> establish an ombudsman for victims and relatives, as it believes today's supportive concern focus {{too much on the}} criminals rather than the victims. It wants the police {{to be able to use}} more non-lethal weapons, such as electroshock weapons. It also does not accept any use of religious or political symbols with the police uniform, and wants to expel foreign citizens who are convicted of crime with a frame of more than three months imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Bede's primary {{intention}} {{in writing}} the Historia Ecclesiastica was to show {{the growth of the}} united church throughout England. The native Britons, whose Christian church survived the departure of the Romans, earn Bede's ire for refusing to help convert the Saxons; {{by the end of the}} Historia the English, and their Church, are dominant over the Britons. This goal, of showing the movement towards unity, explains Bede's animosity towards the British method of calculating Easter: much of the Historia is devoted to a history of the dispute, including the final resolution at the Synod of Whitby in 664. Bede is also concerned to show the unity of the English, despite the disparate kingdoms that still existed when he was writing. He <b>also</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> instruct the reader by spiritual example, and to entertain, and to the latter end he adds stories about many of the places and people about which he wrote.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority {{announced}} plans to renovate the train station. This, along the village's plans to revitalize the entire village of Sloatsburg, was thought to give the bland train station a more traditional look. This would include adding a roof to protect commuters and visitors from the elements, such as rain or snow, handicap-accessible ramps for wheelchairs, better lighting, more seats for people to wait, and a heated shelter. (A shelter exists, but is not heated). The village <b>also</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> use a $50,000 grant from the state to construct a large municipal parking lot near the station. This would get more people to use the station, as because {{with the lack of}} facilities, the station is under-used. The preliminary design was made by Jeff Livingston, an architect on the Sloatsburg Revitalization Committee.|$|E

5|$|Coon {{decides to}} rid the town of Mysterion, enlisting the help of Professor Chaos (Butters) and his sidekick General Disarray (Dougie). Unlike the Coon, Professor Chaos and General Disarray have become as {{familiar}} to the residents of South Park as Mysterion. Butters <b>also</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list of suspects to the boys from Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from that of others. In contrast, he has nearly pinned down Coon's identity to a few fat celebrities, and Cartman. In a scheme to uncover Mysterion's identity, the Coon convinces Professor Chaos to threaten {{the destruction of a}} hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity. After the Coon plants the TNT and leaves to buy detonators, Mysterion unexpectedly arrives. He points out that this is not Professor Chaos' usual style, and fights Professor Chaos and General Disarray on top of the building. A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no actions, believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos' aluminum foil armor. Dramatically, the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion, with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero. At that point, Professor Chaos and General Disarray run off in defeat. After their victory, the Coon convinces Mysterion to unmask himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion's secret is revealed.|$|E

On energy efficiency, Wal-Mart wants to increase the fuel efficiency of its truck fleet by 25% {{over the next three years}} and double it within ten years, moving from 6.5 mpg. This seems an attainable goal, and by 2020, it is expected to save the company $494 million a year.
