5000|$|This {{function}} is not generally supported by modular connectors. Modular connectors providing suitable switch contacts are available but not common; Instead, mode 3 devices use two modular connectors, {{one for the}} incoming line {{and the other for}} the outgoing line. The convenience of using a single connector in this application is one reason for the continued use of 600 series connectors, but mixing this wiring scheme with modular connectors does not work well. For example, if a modern modem with its supplied 6P2C <b>adaptor</b> is <b>plugged</b> into a conventionally wired 611 mode 3 socket, the result is to disconnect all downstream devices.|$|R

5000|$|Removal of {{the safety}} ground {{connection}} on equipment can expose users to an increased danger of electric shock and may contradict wiring regulations. The safety ground is disconnected by an <b>adaptor</b> (cheater <b>plug)</b> in a power lead in which the ground conductor is deliberately disconnected, or by cutting a ground pin in the power plug. If a fault develops in any line-operated equipment, cable shields and equipment enclosures may become energized, creating an electric shock hazard.

2500|$|A {{conversion}} plug is {{a special}} type of plug suitable for the connection of non-BS1363 type plugs (to a recognized standard) toBS 1363 sockets.

2500|$|Several early American {{electrical}} {{plug and socket}} arrangements were invented by Harvey Hubbell. On 26 February 1903 he filed two patent applications featuring 2-pin <b>plugs</b> and <b>adaptors</b> for using his plugs with existing designs of lamp sockets and wall receptacles. Hubbell's first plug design had two round pins which differed from those already in use in Europe in that {{the tips of the}} pins had annular detents similar to those of present-day jack plugs to positively retain a plug in its socket. [...] In one patent, US 774,250 a plug was used with a socket which screwed into a lampholder (like the early lampholder plugs). In the other patent US 776,326 [...] the same type of plug was used with various three-way adaptors that could be connected to lampholders or [...] "a receptacle of any ordinary type". Figures 2 and 4 of this patent show an <b>adaptor</b> <b>plugged</b> into {{what appears to be a}} [...] "Chapman" [...] receptacle. Hubbell evidently soon found the round pin design unsatisfactory as a subsequent patent US 774,251 filed on May 27, 1904 shows lampholder adaptors similar to those of his first patent for use with plugs having coplanar (tandem) flat pins. Hubbell's catalogue of 1906 includes various three-way adaptors similar to those shown in the US 776,326 patent, but modified for use with the coplanar flat pin plugs. The Chapman receptacle must have been in general use at the time, as it was the only type of non-lampholder receptacle for which adaptors were supplied. The 1906 catalogue says of the Chapman adaptor: [...] "The device avoids fastening the cords together as is necessary with the ordinary Chapman plug when used for more than one purpose." [...] This suggests that Hubbell's original invention was prompted by his observation of the problem that arose with the use of this sort of receptacle and plug. Gradually wall sockets were developed to supplement those that screwed into lampholders.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>adaptors</b> permit {{two or more}} plugs {{to share}} one socket-outlet, or allow {{the use of a}} plug of {{different}} type. There are several common types, including double- and triple-socket blocks, shaver adaptors, and multi-socket strips. [...] Adaptors which allow the use of non-BS1363 plugs, or more than two BS1363 plugs, must be fused. Appliances are designed not to draw more power than their plug is rated for; the use of such adaptors, and also multi-socketed extension leads, makes it possible for several appliances to be connected through a single outlet, with the potential to cause dangerous overloads.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} and characterization of a packaged pressure sensor system suitable for jet engine health monitoring is demonstrated. The sensing system operates from 97 to 117 MHz over a pressure range from 0 to 350 psi and a temperature range from 25 to 500 deg. The sensing system consists of a Clapp-type oscillator that is fabricated on an alumina substrate and is comprised of a Cree SiC MESFET, MIM capacitors, a wire-wound inductor, chip resistors and a SiCN capacitive pressure sensor. The pressure sensor {{is located in the}} LC tank circuit of the oscillator so that a change in pressure causes a change in capacitance, thus changing the resonant frequency of the sensing system. The chip resistors, wire-wound inductors and MIM capacitors have all been characterized at temperature and operational frequency, and perform with less than 5 % variance in electrical performance. The measured capacitive pressure sensing system agrees very well with simulated results. The packaged pressure sensing system is specifically designed to measure the pressure on a jet turbofan engine. The packaged system can be installed by way of borescope <b>plug</b> <b>adaptor</b> fitted to a borescope port exposed to the gas path of a turbofan engine...|$|R
