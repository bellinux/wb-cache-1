40|$|The {{dependency}} of {{our society}} on networked computers has become frightening: In the economy, <b>all-digital</b> <b>networks</b> have turned from facilitators to drivers; as cyber-physical systems are coming of age, computer networks are now becoming the central nervous systems of our physical world—even of highly critical infrastructures such as the power grid. At the same time, the 24 / 7 availability and correct functioning of networked computers {{has become much more}} threatened: The number of sophisticated and highly tailored attacks on IT systems has significantly increased. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a key component of the corresponding defense measures; they have been extensively studied and utilized in the past. Since conventional IDSs are not scalable to big company networks and beyond, nor to massively parallel attacks, Collaborative IDSs (CIDSs) have emerged. They consist of several monitoring components that collect and exchange data. Depending on the specific CIDS architecture, central or distributed analysis components mine the gathered data to identify attacks. Resulting alerts are correlated among multiple monitors {{in order to create a}} holistic view of the network monitored. This article first determines relevant requirements for CIDSs; it then differentiates distinct building blocks as a basis for introducing a CIDS design space and for discussing it with respect to requirements. Based on this design space, attacks that evade CIDSs and attacks on the availability of the CIDSs themselves are discussed. The entire framework of requirements...|$|R

2500|$|The {{regional}} DAB {{block is}} scheduled to have a 99.89-percent population penetration by 2014, corresponding to FM coverage of P1. The high penetration is required because P1 acts as an emergency broadcast station. The commercial National Block I will by then have a 90-percent penetration. This will require a network of between 650 and 1000 transmitters and relays, including 42 main transmitters. When all allocated multiplexes have been built out, there can be offered seventy national radio channels, presuming a mix of music and voice channels and all using DAB+. Parliament has decided to close the FM network in 2017 or 2019, depending on the penetration of digital radio use in 2015. This will make Norway the first country to have an <b>all-digital</b> distribution <b>network</b> for national, terrestrial radio. [...] Local radio channels will be permitted to continue broadcasting on FM. The issue of which stations may continue to use FM and which may broadcast in DAB will be decided in 2015.|$|R
40|$|Neurocomputers offer a massively {{parallel}} computing paradigm by mimicking the human brain. Their efficient use in statistical information processing {{has been proposed}} to overcome critical bottlenecks with traditional computing schemes for applications such as image and speech processing, and associative memory. In neural networks information is generally represented by phase (e. g., oscillatory neural networks) or amplitude (e. g., cellular neural networks). Phase-based neurocomputing is constructed as a network of coupled oscillatory neurons that are connected via programmable phase elements. Representing each neuron circuit with one oscillatory device and implementing programmable phases among neighboring neurons, however, are not clearly feasible from circuits perspective if not impossible. In contrast to nascent oscillatory neurocomputing circuits, mature amplitude-based neural networks offer more efficient circuit solutions using simpler resistive networks where information is carried via voltage- and current-mode signals. Yet, such circuits have not been efficiently realized by CMOS alone due to the needs for an efficient summing mechanism for weighted neural signals and a digitally-controlled weighting element for representing couplings among artificial neurons. Large power consumption and high circuit complexity of such CMOS-based implementations have precluded adoption of amplitude-based neurocomputing circuits as well, and have led researchers to explore the use of emerging technologies for such circuits. Although they provide intriguing properties, previously proposed neurocomputing components based on emerging technologies have not offered a complete and practical solution to efficiently construct an entire system. In this thesis we explore the generalized problem of co-optimization of technology and architecture for such systems, and develop a recipe for device requirements and target capabilities. We describe four plausible technologies, each of which could potentially enable the implementation of an efficient and fully-functional neurocomputing system. We first investigate fully-digital neural network architectures that have been tried before using CMOS technology in which many large-size logic gates such as D flip-flops and look-up tables are required. Using a newly-proposed all-magnetic non-volatile logic family, mLogic, we demonstrate the efficacy of digitizing the oscillators and phase relationships for an oscillatory neural network by exploiting the inherent storage as well as enabling an <b>all-digital</b> cellular neural <b>network</b> hardware with simplified programmability. We perform system-level comparisons of mLogic and 32 nm CMOS for both networks consisting of 60 neurons. Although digital implementations based on mLogic offer improvements over CMOS in terms of power and area, analog neurocomputing architectures {{seem to be more}} compatible with the greatest portion of emerging technologies and devices. For this purpose in this dissertation we explore several emerging technologies with unique device configurations and features such as mCell devices, ovenized aluminum nitride resonators, and tunable multi-gate graphene devices to efficiently enable two key components required for such analog networks – that is, summing function and weighting with compact D/A (digital-to-analog) conversion capability. We demonstrate novel ways to implement these functions and elaborate on our building blocks for artificial neurons and synapses using each technology. We verify the functionality of each proposed implementation using various image processing applications based on compact circuit simulation models for such post-CMOS devices. Finally, we design a proof-of-concept neurocomputing circuitry containing 20 neurons using 65 nm CMOS technology that is based on the primitives that we define for our analog neurocomputing scheme. This allows us to fully recognize the inefficiencies of an all-CMOS implementation for such specific applications. We share our experimental results that are in agreement with circuit simulations for the same image processing applications based on proposed architectures using emerging technologies. Power and area comparisons demonstrate significant improvements for analog neurocomputing circuits when implemented using beyond- CMOS technologies, thereby promising huge opportunities for future energy-efficient computing...|$|R
