5|$|A 1991 {{agreement}} between the City of Portland <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> Oregon to dramatically reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) led to Portland's Big Pipe Project. The project, part of a related series of Portland CSO projects completed in late 2011 {{at a cost of}} $1.44billion, separates the city's sanitary sewer lines from storm-water inputs that sometimes overwhelmed the combined system during heavy rains. When that occurred, some of the raw sewage in the system flowed into the river instead of into the city's wastewater treatment plant. The Big Pipe project and related work reduces CSO volume on the lower river by about 94percent.|$|E
5|$|A death {{sentence}} {{had to be}} passed unanimously, and confirmed in writing by various officers as the verdict passed up the chain of command. A man's battalion and brigade commander tended to comment on his own record, but senior generals {{tended to be more}} concerned with the type of offence <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> discipline in that unit. The Judge Advocate General at GHQ also checked the records for irregularities, before final confirmation (or otherwise) by the Commander-in-Chief of the relevant theatre.|$|E

5|$|Argentina was a {{fragmented}} nation (since the 1852 downfall of Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas), with the Argentine Confederation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> Buenos Aires each vying for supremacy. Flores approached the Buenos Aires Minister of War, Bartolomé Mitre, agreeing {{to throw the}} support of the Colorados behind Buenos Aires in exchange for subsequent Argentine assistance in their fight against the fusionist government in Montevideo (the Uruguayan capital). Flores and his Colorado units served Buenos Aires with fierce determination. They played a decisive role in the Battle of Pavón on 17 September 1861, in which the Confederation was defeated and all Argentina was reunited under the government in Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Diệm {{had little}} {{authority}} beyond {{the gates of}} his own palace. Bảo Đại had little confidence in him and gave him meagre support—the pair had clashed in the past, with Diem resigning as Bảo Đại's Interior Minister two decades earlier, believing {{the head of state}} to be weak and ineffective. Many historians believe that Bảo Đại may have selected Diệm for the latter's ability to attract U.S. support and funding. During the transition period, the French Expeditionary Corps maintained a presence in South Vietnam. This led to tension between France <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam. Diệm, a passionate nationalist, detested the French, who reciprocated, hoping he would fail, even calling for his removal on occasions.|$|E

5|$|Bakshi's frustrations {{with his}} failing {{marriage}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the planet further drove {{his need to}} animate. In 1959, he moved his desk to join {{the rest of the}} animators; after asking Rasinski for material to animate, he received layouts of two scenes: a hat floating on water and Deputy Dawg, the lead character of one of Terrytoons' syndicated television series, running. Despite threats of repercussion from the animators' union, Rasinski fought to keep Bakshi as a layout artist. Bakshi began to see Rasinski as a father figure; Rasinski, childless, was happy to serve as Bakshi's mentor.|$|E
5|$|Californium is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol Cf and atomic number98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, {{and has the}} second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see {{with the unaided eye}} (after einsteinium). The element was named after the university <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> California.|$|E
5|$|Criticisms {{about the}} ISA <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> {{freedom of speech}} and {{assembly}} in Singapore also appear in reports by some foreign and international organizations.

50|$|After the Pacification of Ghent in 1576, Amsterdam {{was forced}} to subject itself to the Prince <b>of</b> Orange <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>of</b> Holland, but <b>the</b> city-government wanted to stay loyal to <b>the</b> king, <b>and</b> they were opposed to letting the {{reformed}} church become the official religion. Only when the new Regent, John of Austria, recognised the Pacification, did Amsterdam follow his example. Lengthy negotiations followed about the Satisfactie (Eng: Satisfaction), a treaty that would put the city {{under the authority of}} the Prince <b>of</b> Orange <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>of</b> Holland. After an incursion into the city by the Geuzen on November 23, 1577, the city government finally signed the treaty on February 8, 1578.|$|R
5|$|Following the Republic of the Congo's {{independence}} from Belgium in 1960, the country fell into disorder as the army mutinied. Shortly thereafter South Kasai <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> Katanga declared {{independence from}} the Congolese government. The latter contained {{the vast majority of}} the Congo's valuable mineral resources and attracted significant mining activity under Belgian rule. Many Katangese thought that they were entitled to the revenue generated through the lucrative industry, and feared that under the new central government it would be distributed among the Congo's poorer provinces. Resulting nativist politics with support from the Belgian government and private interests such as the Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK) precipitated the Katangese secession.|$|E
5|$|Hentoff {{was known}} as a civil libertarian, free speech activist, anti-death penalty advocate, and anti-abortion advocate. He {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> Israel. Hentoff espoused generally liberal views on domestic policy and civil liberties, but in the 1980s, he began articulating more socially conservative positions—opposition to abortion, voluntary euthanasia, and the selective medical treatment of severely disabled infants. Hentoff argued that a consistent life ethic should be the viewpoint of a genuine civil libertarian, arguing that all human rights are at risk when the rights of any one group of people are diminished, that human rights are interconnected, and people deny others' human rights at their peril.|$|E
5|$|Initial public {{reaction}} to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. Helens–Gifford Pinchot National Forest area, but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring Oregon not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The United States Forest Service <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation.|$|E

5|$|Kalimpong {{is a major}} ginger {{growing area}} of India. Kalimpong <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> Sikkim {{together}} contribute 15 percent of ginger produced in India. The Darjeeling Himalayan hill region is internationally famous for its tea industry. However, most of the tea gardens are {{on the western side}} of Teesta river (towards the town of Darjeeling) and so tea gardens near Kalimpong contribute only 4percent of total tea production of the region. In Kalimpong division, 90percent of land is cultivable but only 10percent is used for tea production. Kalimpong is well known for its flower export industry—especially for its wide array of indigenous orchids and gladioli.|$|E
