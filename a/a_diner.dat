They stayed in contact with each other in secret for several months afterward. In the fall of 1978, Lucy arranges a reunion for her parents. Gary and Valene move back to Southfork for a short time, but their reunion is again undermined by J.R., who arranged for Gary to take charge of a failing company, hoping that the pressure would drive Gary away. Gary realized that he would fall off the wagon unless he left Southfork, so he departed. J.R. then turned on Valene, trying to bribe her, before ordering her to leave. In December 1979, Valene and Gary are reunited once more in Dallas, and get married for the second time. Gary's parents, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), as well as Gary's brother, Bobby (Patrick Duffy), and sister-in-law Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), attend the wedding.
