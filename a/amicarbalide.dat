40|$|When {{administered}} subcutaneously in 2 equal daily doses {{at a total}} {{dosage rate}} of 20 mg/kg, <b>amicarbalide</b> {{was found to be}} an effective agent for controlling acute infections of Anaplasma marginate and A. centrale in intact and splenectomized cattle. Attempts to sterilize patent and latent Anaplasma infections, however, were unsuccessful. At total dosage rates of 40 mg/kg and higher, <b>amicarbalide</b> exhibited potent hepato- and nephrotoxic tendencies. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

40|$|BALB/c mice, immunized against babesia rodhaini by an <b>amicarbalide</b> {{controlled}} infection, {{were exposed}} to selective immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids and anti-thymocyte serum (ATS) respectively. Hydrocortisone acetate, 100 mg/kg, given i. p. six times during the three weeks after challenge inoculation caused a rising parasitaemia and high mortality (6 / 7). Dexamethasone in the drinking water at 20 mg/l or 10 mg/l for 22 days had a similar suppressive effect on the protection against babesia rodhaini. Mortality, 100...|$|E
40|$|Severe malaria is a {{life-threatening}} complication of an infection with the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which requires immediate treatment. Safety and efficacy concerns with currently used drugs accentuate {{the need for}} new chemotherapeutic options against severe malaria. Here we describe a medicinal chemistry program starting from <b>amicarbalide</b> that led to two compounds with optimized pharmacological and antiparasitic properties. SC 81458 and the clinical development candidate, SC 83288, are fast-acting compounds that can cure a P. falciparum infection in a humanized NOD/SCID mouse model system. Detailed preclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies reveal no observable drawbacks. Ultra-deep sequencing of resistant parasites identifies the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + transporting PfATP 6 as a putative determinant of resistance to SC 81458 and SC 83288. Features, such as fast parasite killing, good safety margin, a potentially novel mode of action and a distinct chemotype support the clinical development of SC 83288, as an intravenous application for the treatment of severe malaria.

40|$|Cationic {{compounds}} used in {{the treatment}} of veterinary African trypanosomiasis have structural properties similar to those of pentamidine, which has been {{used in the}} therapy of human trypanosomiasis and infection with Pneumocystis carinii. We have compared the activities of these drugs and other antimicrobial agents in an immunosuppressed rat model of P. carinii pneumonia. Diminazene, imidocarb, <b>amicarbalide,</b> quinapyramine, and isometamidium showed efficacy {{greater than or equal to}} that of pentamidine in the therapy of P. carinii infection, whereas ethidium and methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) were only slightly active against the organism. Diminazene and pentamidine also exhibited comparable efficacy in P. carinii prophylaxis, alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a polyamine inhibitor, was ineffective therapy when used alone and did not improve the effectiveness of pentamidine or diminazene. Quinine, quinidine, quinacrine, chlorpromazine, spiramycin, Pentostam, Astiban, dehydroemetine, ampicillin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and spectinomycin also showed little or no activity against the organism. Thus, in this model anti-P. carinii activity appears to be a common property of veterinary cationic trypanocidal compounds. This should be important in studying structure-activity relationships and in developing new drugs for the treatment of P. carinii infection in humans...|$|E
