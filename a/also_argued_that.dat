5|$|The United States was {{represented}} by Louis F. Claiborne, assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General. The United States <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Menominee Termination Act did not extinguish hunting and fishing rights under the 1854 treaty and therefore the tribe was not due compensation from the United States. Claiborne <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> whatever regulatory rights which were held {{by the federal government}} were transferred to the state of Wisconsin by the termination act.|$|E
5|$|In their articles, {{the champions}} of each state argued that Pike's {{account of his}} route {{supported}} their site, and entirely ruled out the other. Both sides <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Pike's description of the local topography matched their site and differed significantly from the other.|$|E
5|$|Other {{authors have}} <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{indirect}} land use changes produce other significant {{social and environmental}} impacts, affecting biodiversity, water quality, food prices and supply, land tenure, worker migration, and community and cultural stability.|$|E
5000|$|Hyslop <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> Salt conflates {{disparate}} ethical questions: ...|$|R
5000|$|Love and Theft {{extensively}} {{documents the}} racism and cultural appropriation inherent in blackface performance; Lott <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> it demonstrates a current of homosexual desire for Black men's bodies; he <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> [...] "mixed in with vicious parodies and lopsided appropriation, minstrelsy involved a real love of African American culture." ...|$|R
5000|$|DeMint <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> {{same-sex}} marriage infringes upon religious liberty: ...|$|R
5|$|Thio <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{without a}} constitutionally {{expressed}} right to vote, the judiciary is handicapped in interpreting this implied right, given its conservative approach to reading the Constitution {{and the fact}} that it is unlikely to appeal to normative ideas such as representative democracy.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Hudson has <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{the fraud}} {{argument}} is significantly flawed. The {{theory suggests that}} liability for the property comes about from fraud; in fact, liability comes about {{as soon as the}} trustee accepts the property to hold on trust, and so the fraud theory is not necessary to bind the trustee's hands.|$|E
5|$|An {{expert panel}} of {{engineers}} {{released a report}} outlining concerns regarding the decreased loop ramp radii {{and a lack of}} protective guardrail at sharp curves, in addition to the lack of a concrete median barrier to separate the opposite directions of travel. However, it was <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the large grass median was sufficient to prevent cross-over collisions, given that Highway410 has a similar median.|$|E
50|$|Branch <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> Jeroboam's {{wife was}} abused by her husband.|$|R
25|$|Abd-al-Munim Al-Nimr, <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> riba must involve {{harm to the}} debtor.|$|R
50|$|Critics <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> some fairy {{doors are}} overly gaudy and garish.|$|R
5|$|Blythe's {{defense team}} {{attacked}} {{differences between the}} testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in 2010 and at the court. Among other things, one of the witnesses originally alleged that Nosek and Blythe shook hands or {{that one of them}} offered hand to another on stage; however, at the court hearing, he testified that there was no prior contact between them. Blythe <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior.|$|E
5|$|Consequences of this {{include the}} time–space frame of a moving body {{appearing}} {{to slow down}} and contract (in the direction of motion) when measured in the frame of the observer. This paper <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.|$|E
5|$|Hill <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> if the Electoral Act {{actually}} {{appeared to}} confer jurisdiction on the court, it was nevertheless invalid, as {{the determination of}} disputes about election results is a non-judicial function. Also, the doctrine of separation of powers meant that non-judicial power cannot be conferred on a Chapter III Court such as the High Court.|$|E
5000|$|A {{defendant}} could <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> he {{was engaged}} in mutually consensual behavior.|$|R
25|$|Some <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> {{far from}} infusing energy, it could further enfeeble the bureaucracy.|$|R
50|$|Some psychoanalytic theorists <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> passionate anti-racism {{can produce}} {{psychological}} states analogous to racism.|$|R
5|$|Maeser {{believed}} that religion {{played a key}} role in true education. He viewed each student as a child of God that had an individual capacity and potential. He thought that all schools should adhere to some religious aspect. He <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> public high schools should be supplemented by religion classes. Maeser, however, was respectful of other religious denominations although Brigham Young Academy and Brigham Young University integrated beliefs from the LDS Church.|$|E
5|$|NESCo <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{they had}} chosen the site to protect the city's amenities, {{in that it was}} outside the city boundary, {{partially}} surrounded by higher ground, and in the lee of prevailing winds. They also said that much could be done architecturally to fit the station into its surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Republicans portrayed slavery as uncivilized {{and argued}} for {{abolition}} {{as a necessary}} step in national progress. Amendment supporters <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the slave system had negative effects on white people. These included the lower wages resulting from competition with forced labor, as well as repression of abolitionist whites in the South. Advocates said ending slavery would restore the First Amendment and other constitutional rights violated by censorship and intimidation in slave states.|$|E
50|$|Banksira <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> k is an {{allophone}} of x and b an allophone of β.|$|R
5000|$|Marx <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that,</b> at {{the same}} time, such an {{economic}} equation accomplishes two other things: ...|$|R
5000|$|He <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> {{the stark}} {{comparisons}} between [...] "whites" [...] and [...] "blacks" [...] are misleading.|$|R
5|$|The {{name was}} coined by the {{historian}} Andrew Watson in an influential 1974 paper. He listed eighteen crops that were widely diffused during the Islamic period, including four staple crops, namely durum wheat, Asiatic rice, sorghum, and cotton. He <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{techniques such as}} irrigation were spread across the region at that time. The paper was not based on direct archaeological or scientific evidence, and its approach has been called old-fashioned and philological.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{knowledge}} about the capability of radar to create an effective centralized early warning system also contributed to the over-reliance on the self-defense capabilities of bombers. However Hansell <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> ignorance of radar was fortuitous in the long run. He surmised that had radar been a factor in making doctrine, many theorists would have reasoned that massed defenses would make all strategic air attacks too costly, inhibiting if not entirely suppressing the concepts that proved decisive in World War II and essential {{to the creation of the}} United States Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{arguments}} {{over whether or}} not austerity, rather than increased or frozen spending, is a macroeconomic solution, union leaders have <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the working population is being unjustly held responsible for the economic mismanagement errors of economists, investors, and bankers. Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed {{as a consequence of the}} global economic crisis of 2007–2010, and this has led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe, but the entire world.|$|E
25|$|Critics <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> {{there is}} {{a link between the}} Rare Earth Hypothesis and the creationist ideas of {{intelligent}} design.|$|R
50|$|One may <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> {{the protagonist}} of this play, in pursuit of his career, has become a cliché himself.|$|R
5000|$|Critics <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> {{using the}} word [...] "abstinence," [...] then {{teaching}} about safe sex and contraceptives, can be contradictory.|$|R
5|$|Aquinas {{reasoned}} that acting contrary to conscience is an evil action but an errant conscience is only blameworthy {{if it is}} the result of culpable or vincible ignorance of factors that one has a duty to have knowledge of. Aquinas <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> conscience should be educated to act towards real goods (from God) which encouraged human flourishing, rather than the apparent goods of sensory pleasures. In his Commentary on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics Aquinas claimed it was weak will that allowed a non-virtuous man to choose a principle allowing pleasure ahead of one requiring moral constraint.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the federal response was limited {{as a result of the}} Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E
5|$|At {{a conference}} in September 1906, many of the {{disagreements}} over the ship's design were resolved. The Naval Constructor, von Eickstedt, argued that since the explosive trials for the proposed protection systems for the new battlecruiser had not been completed, the construction should be postponed, to allow for any alterations to the design. He <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> guns of 21cm(8.3in) or 24cm(9.4in) caliber would be sufficient to penetrate the armor of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral August von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated that for the ship {{to be able to}} engage battleships, the 28cm(11in) caliber guns were necessary.|$|E
50|$|Some experts <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> under US {{legislation}} a trust arrangement {{means that}} funds are taxable within the QROPS themselves.|$|R
25|$|She <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> {{the correct}} {{identification}} of Annie Lee Moss, among others, as communists was misreported {{by the liberal}} media.|$|R
50|$|He <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> Bush {{pressured}} {{intelligence agencies}} to find proof that Saddam helped al-Qaeda plan the September 11, 2001 attacks.|$|R
