He wrote with great speed and {{completed}} Giselle in <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b> The music {{was written in the}} smooth, song-like style of the day called cantilena.

5|$|Elita dropped heavy {{rainfall}} {{of more than}} 200mm (8inches), which damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Madagascar. Over 50,000people were left homeless, primarily in Mahajanga and Toliara provinces. Flooding from the storm ruined more than 450km² (170sqmi) of agricultural land, including important crops for food. Across the island, the cyclone caused 33deaths, with its impact further compounded by Cyclone Gafilo <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> later. Elsewhere, Elita brought rainfall and damage to Mozambique and Malawi, and its outer wind circulation produced rough seas and strong gusts in Seychelles, Mauritius, and Réunion.|$|E

5|$|The nor'easter struck <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> {{after the}} {{destructive}} Perfect Storm, and preceded another damaging storm in December 1992. The storm produced strong winds and high surf during a new moon, {{which resulted in}} astronomically high tides. Such tides caused coastal flooding and damage to dune systems. Due to its small size, the storm's impact was highly localized and did not spread far {{to the north of}} the Delaware Bay.|$|E
5|$|Though the bobcat prefers {{rabbits and}} hares, it hunts insects, chickens, geese and other birds, small rodents, and deer. Prey {{selection}} depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces. The bobcat breeds from winter into spring {{and has a}} gestation period of <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>About</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> {{into the}} siege of the Peñol de Cerquín, the {{majority}} of Spanish soldiers in Honduras were concentrated around the fortress. Small groups were scattered elsewhere, and both Gracias a Dios and Santa María de Comayagua were dangerously vulnerable, with almost no soldiers left there. Seeing {{the vulnerability of the}} Spanish positions across the greater province, Lempira declared a general uprising. The whole region south of the Peñol rose up, as well as neighbouring parts of El Salvador around San Salvador and San Miguel, where they caused serious damage to the Spanish. The Comayagaua Valley joined the revolt, as did the mountain regions around San Pedro, and outlying areas around Trujillo.|$|E

5|$|After {{allegations}} that the design contractor had inflated costs for the tunnel {{in order to avoid}} sharing the job with an outside tunneling contractor, the long tunnel concept was revived in April 2006. The allegations led to calls for an outside cost estimate to determine more realistic tunnel costs. On May 15, 2006, Virginia Transportation Secretary Pierce R. Homer announced the creation of an advisory panel headed by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The panel had <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> to evaluate options for completing the line through Tysons Corner, with the results presented to the state on July 27, 2006 and published on July 31, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{hurricane}} and the widespread destruction, {{the hurricane}} caused outbreaks of malaria, dengue, cholera, and various fever and respiratory illnesses. Ongoing flooding caused {{an outbreak of}} Leptospirosis, notably in Cortés Department. There were widespread food and water shortages, leaving villagers near-starvation. Damaged crops also prevented the export of cash crops, and exports decreased by 9.4% in 1999. Many of the people left homeless also became unemployed, and there were reductions in exports and economic growth. Officials set up shelters that housed 285,000people for about a month. In Tegucigalpa, where the Choluteca River was dammed by a landslide, a temporary lagoon filled with sewage persisted for <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>months,</b> until a crew from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and United States Geological Survey dug a channel to drain the water.|$|E

However, on 18 February 1945 {{she was involved}} in a collision with , another Type XXIII U-boat, off Heiligendamm on the Baltic coast. U-2344 was sunk, with the loss of 11 of her crew. It took <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> for U-2336 to actually leave her home port of Kiel, which she finally did on 18 April 1945 under a new commander, Kapitänleutnant Emil Klusmeier. Following five days of traveling across the straits of Kattegat and Skagerrak, U-2336 reached Larvik, Norway on 24 April 1945; which was to be her new home port {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Kemp {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list on May 14 because of a hamstring injury, ending his streak of 399 consecutive games played, which was the longest in the majors at the time. After his DL stint, he promptly re-injured his hamstring two days later while running the bases, and returned to the DL. Despite missing about 2 months with injuries, Kemp was voted by the fans as a starter for the 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. As he was still on the disabled list, Kemp did not play in the game but he did participate in the Home Run Derby for the second straight year, hitting one home run in the Derby. Kemp finally returned to the Dodgers lineup on July 13, after missing <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> with his hamstring injury.|$|E

The arch was completely destroyed on 12 February 1944, when a Royal Army Service Corps truck hit the remaining parts of the structure. The stone remains were supposedly stored by the British but, similar to several other historic relics, they were never retrieved by the Maltese and the whereabouts are unknown. However, the arch's two marble plaques were repossessed.|$|E

5|$|On 26 September 1371, Vukašin {{was killed}} and his forces {{defeated}} in the Battle of Maritsa. <b>About</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> later, Tsar Uroš died. This formally made Marko {{the king of the}} Serbian land; however, Serbian noblemen, who had become effectively independent from the central authority, did not even consider to recognise him as their supreme ruler. Sometime after 1371, he became an Ottoman vassal; by 1377, significant portions of the territory he inherited from Vukašin were seized by other noblemen. King Marko, in reality, came to be a regional lord who ruled over a relatively small territory in western Macedonia. He funded the construction of the Monastery of Saint Demetrius near Skopje (better known as Marko's Monastery), which was completed in 1376. Marko died on 17 May 1395, fighting for the Ottomans against the Wallachians in the Battle of Rovine.|$|E

Sometimes, a second litter is born {{as late as}} September. The female {{generally}} gives birth in an enclosed space, usually a small cave or hollow log. The young open their eyes by the ninth or tenth day. They start exploring their surroundings at four weeks and are weaned at <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b> Within three to five months, they begin to travel with their mother.
