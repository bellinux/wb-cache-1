40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{long-term}} effect of <b>auricular</b> therapy <b>using</b> magnetic pearls administered {{for the elderly}} suffering from insomnia. Design: A follow-up study after a randomized controlled trial. Settings: Four hostels for the elderly in Hong Kong. Interventions: This paper focuses on reporting the long-term effect of <b>auricular</b> therapy <b>using</b> magnetic pearls {{in the experimental group}} of a randomized controlled study. Fifteen volunteer participants were followed up at 1 -, 3 -, and 6 -month intervals after a 3 -week treatment course. Outcome measures: Objective sleep parameters using actigraphic monitoring were collected at different intervals of time after the therapy. Results: Results of RANOVA demonstrate that {{there was a significant difference}} of nocturnal sleep time (F 2. 3 0, 2 9. 9 0 = 3. 63, P< 0. 05) and marginally differences of sleep efficiency (F 4, 5 2 = 2. 52, P= 0. 05) at baseline, immediately after the therapy, and at the three time intervals at 1, 3 and 6 months. The results illustrate that the mean nocturnal sleep time (F= 4. 95, P= 0. 30, R 2 = 0. 91) and the mean sleep efficiency (F= 13. 50, P= 0. 19, R 2 = 0. 96) also remained constant over the 6 -month follow up period. The results of least square polynomial regression analysis also illustrate that the mean NST (F= 4. 95, P= 0. 30, R 2 = 0. 91) and the mean sleep efficiency (F= 13. 50, P= 0. 19, R 2 = 0. 96) remained constant over the 6 -month follow up period. Conclusion: The results of this follow up study indicate that <b>auricular</b> therapy <b>using</b> magnetic pearls could have a long-term effect, at least within the observed period of time, on improving the quality as well as the quantity of sleep among the elderly.

40|$|Objectives: Constipation {{has been}} {{identified}} as a worldwide health problem among elderly people. Currently, it is not effectively relieved by the use of laxatives and lifestyle modification. Previous studies reported promising results in managing constipation with auricular acupressure (AA), although its effectiveness was not affirmed. This study is to evaluate the complementary effects of AA in relieving constipation symptoms and in promoting disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among elderly residential care home (RCH) residents in Hong Kong. Design:Randomized placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Elderly RCH. Intervention: Ninety-nine participants were randomly assigned to either experimental group (AA <b>using</b> <b>auricular</b> plasters with magnetic pellets), placebo-controlled group (AA <b>using</b> <b>auricular</b> plasters with Semen Vaccariae), or usual care group (AA <b>using</b> <b>auricular</b> plasters only). AA was applied onto seven auricular acupoints for 10 days. Main outcome measures: Constipation symptoms and disease-specific HRQOL were measured before AA, at the completion of AA (D 10), and at the 10 th-day follow-up time (D 20). Results: Significant group × time interaction effect was found in the change of satisfaction subscale between the experimental group and placebo-controlled group at D 10 (p = 0. 016) and D 20 (p = 0. 016) relative to the baselines. For both constipation symptoms and disease-specific HRQOL, the experimental group demonstrated the greatest improvement after receiving AA at both D 10 and D 20 compared with the other two groups. Conclusion: The current findings indicated positive clinical value of AA with magnetic pellets in managing constipation in elderly RCH residents.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effectiveness of auricular therapy on sleep behaviors in the elderly. One hundred and twenty participants of 60 years old or above and who were suffering from sleep disturbances were invited to participate in this study. Eligible participants were randomly allocated to receive <b>auricular</b> therapy <b>using</b> Junci Medulla (Group A = 30), Semen Vaccariae (Group B = 30) or magnetic pearls (Group C = 60). Groups A and B were the control groups, while Group C was the experimental group. Seven auricular points which are thought to have an effect on promoting sleep were selected. The total treatment course lasted for three weeks. Objective measurement using actigraphic monitoring was performed before the therapy commenced, in the middle period of the therapy, and within one week after the therapy had been completed. After the therapy, there were significant differences among the three groups in terms of the nocturnal sleep time (NST) (F 2, 117, = 6. 84, p < 0. 05) and sleep efficiency (SE) (F 2, 117, = 7 - 69, p < 0. 05). Significant improvement in the sleep behaviors was observed in the experimental group using magnetic pearls. In a backward multiple regression, the effect of auricular therapy on SE after allowing for age in female participants is of high statistical significance (F 3, 106, = 9. 04, p < 0. 001).

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} provision of immediate implant-supported <b>auricular</b> prosthesis <b>using</b> surgical navigation and CAD/CAM technology. Methods & Materials: A stereomodel was generated by rapid-prototyping (RP) based on the CT Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data set of a patient with a defective right auricle. By using the RP software, a mirrored image of the contralateral intact ear was produced and used for implant planning. The thickness of overlying soft tissues at the defect side was also measured by the software. The surgical field was then defined and a disc of 120 mm in diameter, centred at the external acoustic meatus, was segmented out from the stereomodel {{according to the data}} measured to simulate the mastoid bone. The defect was filled with a translucent silicone material to simulate the skin. A silicone mould of the mirrored ear was fabricated by RP. A wax pattern was produced from the mould and the silicone ear was processed with a housing made of acrylic resin. During operation, a silicone flap was raised and two dummy implants were inserted as planned using the surgical navigation system. The flap was thinned and closed. After the post-operative CT was taken, appropriate abutments were selected and inserted into the implants. Magnets were placed on the abutments and picked up by the acrylic housing inside the silicone ear with cold-cured acrylic resin. The data of the post-operative CT were compared with the planned trajectories by image fusion technique using surgical navigation software. Drill depth, angle in axial and coronal plane, and entry point position of each implant were measured. Results: The mean deviation of the post-operative data from the planned ones were as follows: drill depth (0. 7 mm), angle in coronal plane (1. 6 °), angle in axial plane (1. 5 °) and entry point position (2. 6 mm). The whole process including preoperative planning, software manipulation, operation by navigation, fabrication and insertion of auricular prosthesis appeared to be feasible and acceptable for clinical application.

Background: Loss of an auricle {{may be due to}} congenital disease, trauma, or surgical removal of benign or malignant tumors. Auricular defects can be repaired, or reconstructed with autogenous tissue, but this has its own limitations and additional surgical co morbidities. A good alternative is to develop an auricular prosthesis. To obtain an accurate morphology of prosthetic ear various methods have been used making use of technology. However, still the most commonly used method involves manual sculpting of the prosthetic ear and final prosthesis fabrication using medical grade silicon.

Study selection: Any randomized controlled trials using AA as an intervention without using any co-interventions for insomnia were included. Studies using AA versus no treatment, placebo, sham AA, or Western medicine were included. Data extraction: Two (2) independent reviewers were responsible for data extraction and assessment. The efficacy of AA was estimated by the relative risk (RR) using a meta-analysis. Results: Eight hundred and seventy eight (878) papers were searched. Six (6) trials (402 treated with AA among 673 participants) that met the inclusion criteria were retrieved. A meta-analysis showed that AA was chosen with a higher priority among the treatment subjects than among the controls (p < 0. 05). The recovery and improvement rates produced by AA {{was significantly higher than}} those of diazepam (p < 0. 05). The rate of success was higher when AA was used for enhancement of sleeping hours up to 6 hours in treatment subjects (p < 0. 05). The efficacy of using Semen vaccariae ear seeds was better than that of the controls (p < 0. 01); while magnetic pearls did not show statistical significance (p = 0. 28).

40|$|In about 2 : 10, 000 births the {{external}} {{part of the}} ear, the auricle, is severely malformed or absent. Furthermore, tumors and trauma can cause defects to the auricle. For patients with dysplasia of the auricle, and especially for children, an inconspicuous outer appearance with life-like auricles is important for their psychological and emotional well being {{as well as their}} psycho-social development. Auricular reconstruction remains a great challenge due to the complexity of surgical reconstruction using rib cartilage. Despite the advances in stem cell technology and biomaterials, auricular cartilage tissue engineering (TE) is still in an early stage of development due to critical requirements demanding appropriate mechanical properties and shape stability of the tissue-engineered construct. This thesis has focused on developing patient-specific tissue-engineered auricles for one-step surgery using a novel biomaterial, bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), seeded with human nasoseptal chondrocytes (hNC) and bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC). Biomechanical properties of human auricle cartilage were measured and used as a benchmark for tuning BNC properties. In order to meet the biomechanical requirements, a scaffold with bilayer architecture composed of a dense BNC support layer and a macroporous structure was designed. Firstly, the biocompatibility of the dense BNC layer was investigated, demonstrating a minimal foreign body response according to standards set forth in ISO 10993. Secondly, different methods to create macroporous BNC scaffolds were studied and the redifferentiation capacity of hNCs was evaluated in vitro; revealing that macroporous BNC scaffolds support cell ingrowth, proliferation and neocartilage formation. The bilayer BNC scaffold was biofabricated and tested for endotoxins and cytotoxicity before evaluating in long-term 3 D culture, and subsequently in vivo for eight weeks—in an immunocompromised animal model. The results demonstrated that the non-pyrogenic and non- cytotoxic bilayer BNC scaffold offers a good mechanical stability and maintains a structural integrity, while providing a porous 3 D environment that is suitable for hNCs and MNCs to produce neocartilage, in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, patient-specific auricular BNC scaffolds with bilayer architecture were biofabricated and seeded with autologous rabbit auricular chondrocytes (rAC) for implantation in an immunocompetent rabbit model for six weeks. The results demonstrated the shape stability of the rAC-seeded scaffolds and neocartilage depositions in the immunocompetent autologous grafts. 3 D bioprinting was also evaluated for biofabrication of patient-specific, chondrocyte-laden <b>auricular</b> constructs <b>using</b> a bioink composed of nanofibrillated cellulose and alginate. Bioprinted auricular constructs showed an excellent shape and size stability after in vitro culture. Moreover, this bioink supports redifferentiation of hNCs while offering excellent printability, making this a promising approach for auricular cartilage TE. Furthermore, the use of bioreactors is essential for the development of tissue-engineered cartilage in vitro. Thus, a compression bioreactor was utilized to apply dynamic mechanical stimulation to cell-seeded constructs as a means to enhance production of extracellular matrix in vitro. In this work, a potential clinical therapy for <b>auricular</b> reconstruction <b>using</b> tissue-engineered auricles is demonstrated; where BNC is proposed as a promising non-degradable biomaterial with good chemical and mechanical stability for auricular cartilage TE. Although the primary focus of this thesis is on auricular reconstruction, the methods developed are also applicable in the regeneration of other cartilage tissues such as those found in the nose, trachea, spine and articular joints...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundTo {{construct}} a sophisticated three-dimensional framework, numerous modifications {{have been reported}} in the literature. However, most surgeons have paid little attention to the anatomical configuration of the concha and more to its deepness and hollowness, leading to unsatisfactory outcomes. MethodsFor a configuration of the concha that is definitely anatomical, the author further developed and employed the conchal bowl element, which has been used by several surgeons although the results have not been published elsewhere. The author constructed the conchal bowl element in one of three patterns according to the amount of available cartilages: one block, two-pieces, or a cymba bowl element only. A total of 20 patients underwent <b>auricular</b> reconstruction <b>using</b> a costal cartilage framework between 2009 and 2012. The 8 earliest reconstructions were performed without a conchal bowl element and the latter 12 with a conchal bowl element. The patients were followed up for more than 1 year. The aesthetic results were scored by evaluating characteristics involving the stability of the crus helicis, the conchal definition, and the smoothness of the helical curve. ResultsThe ears reconstructed early without a conchal bowl element showed a shallow and one or two incompletely separated concha with an obliterated cymba conchal space. They also did not have a realistic or smooth curve of the helix because of an unstable crus helicis. However, ears reconstructed later with the concha bowl element showed a definite crus helicis, deep cymba conchal space, and smooth helical curve. ConclusionsThe construction of the conchal bowl element is simple, not time-consuming procedure. It is suggested that the conchal bowl element must be constructed and attached to the main framework for natural configuration of the reconstructed ear...|$|R

This article will describe our results following intratemporal facial nerve grafting in 44 patients. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 44 patients requiring intratemporal facial nerve repair following lateral skull base tumor resection at our tertiary care, academic medical center. Results: Tumor histology included 17 parotid cancers, 13 temporal bone malignancies, 9 glomus tumors, 3 facial neuromas, and 2 endolymphatic sac tumors. The greater <b>auricular</b> nerve was <b>used</b> in 25 patients and the sural nerve was used in 19 cases. Forty patients were available for facial function assessment at 2 years. Using the House-Brackmann (H-B) recovery scale, the breakdown of patients by facial function was as follows: Grade I, 0 patients; Grade II, 4 patients; Grade III, 29 patients; Grade IV, 4 patients; Grade V, 3 patients; and Grade VI, 0 patients. Conclusions: Facial paralysis may occur from intrinsic or external lateral skull base invasion of the facial nerve. Intratemporal interposition grafting resulted in favorable facial function (H-B II or III) in 33 of the 40 (82. 5 %) patients at the 2 -year assessment...|$|R

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect {{that can be very}} disabling and can limit or delay the dose of chemotherapy that can be administered. Acupuncture may be effective for treating peripheral neuropathy. The aim {{of this study was to}} review the available literature on the use of acupuncture for CIPN. The systematic literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane Database, CINHAL, and ISI Proceedings. Hand searching was conducted, and consensus was reached on all extracted data. Only papers in the English language were included, irrespective of study design. From 3989 retrieved papers, 8 relevant papers were identified. One was an experimental study which showed that electroacupuncture suppressed CIPN pain in rats. In addition, there were 7 very heterogeneous clinical studies, 1 controlled randomised study <b>using</b> <b>auricular</b> acupuncture, 2 randomized controlled studies using somatic acupuncture, and 3 case series/case reports which suggested a positive effect of acupuncture in CIPN.

40|$|The aim is {{to study}} the <b>use</b> of <b>auricular</b> {{cartilage}} in cleft rhinoplasty. 10 patients with unilateral cleft lip nasal deformity underwent secondary cleft rhinoplasty <b>using</b> <b>auricular</b> cartilage as an onlay graft to augment the hypoplastic ala on the cleft side and also as a columellar strut. The patients were in {{the age group of}} 16 to 30 years, {{with a mean age of}} 21. 1 years. All the cases have been followed up from the time of operation on a monthly basis up to a maximum of 24 months. The mean follow up period in this study was 12. 8 months. Clinical analysis was performed preoperatively and 5 months post operatively and on a monthly basis ever since. The present study demonstrated that auricular cartilage proved to be a good onlay graft to augment the hypoplastic cartilage and also as a strong columellar strut. We have achieved a 23 % decrease in the alar width, 30 % increase in the alar height and 58 % increase in the columellar height on the cleft side post operatively. There was no donor site or recipient site morbidity in any of our cases. Satisfactory results were obtained. This procedure can be regarded as a good method for correction of mild to moderate cleft lip nasal defects...|$|R
40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: Determine the {{effective}} electromechanical reshaping (EMR) parameters for shape change and cell viability in the ex vivo rabbit costal cartilage model. Study Design: Ex vivo animal study combined with computer modeling to guide electrode placement and polarity selection. Methods: Rabbit costal cartilages were secured in a jig that approximated {{the shape of}} the rabbit auricle framework. Fi-nite element modeling was used to select the initial electrode geometry, polarity, spacing, and estimate dosimetry parameters. Porcine costal cartilage was utilized to refine the selection of dosing parameters. Parametric analysis was performed to deter-mine the effect of voltage and application time on tissue shape change. Next, rabbit rib cartilage was reshaped, varying volt-age and application time to identify the lowest parameters to produce acceptable shape change mimicking native auricular cartilage. Acceptable qualitative shape change was determined on a five-point Likert scale analyzed using one-way general linear analysis of variance. Confocal microscopy with live/dead cell viability analysis determined the degree of injury and the distribution of live and dead cells. Results: The minimum acceptable deformation of rabbit costal cartilage was found at 4 V– 3 minutes. Viability analysis of cartilage reshaped at 4 V– 3 minutes demonstrates cell injury extending 2 mm away from each electrode with viable cells found between the electrodes. Conclusions: The EMR parameters of 4 V– 3 minutes demonstrates appropriate shape change producing grafts that resemble the native auricle and contains the viable cells adequate for clinical evaluation.

This study aimed {{to investigate the}} accuracy and precision of <b>using</b> <b>auricular</b> examination (AE) as a complementary diagnostic tool for screening hepatic disorders. Twenty patients suffering from liver dysfunction and 25 controls aged 18 – 60 years were recruited from an acute hospital. Participants were examined using three AE methods including visual inspection, electrical skin resistance measurement, and tenderness testing on the liver AA zone of both ears. Significant {{differences were found in}} visual inspection and electrical skin resistance on the AA zones between the two groups. Patients suffering from liver dysfunction tended to have at least one abnormality in skin color, appearance, presence of papules, abundance of capillary and desquamation on the ear (Relative Risk—Right ear: RR = 2. 9, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 4, 6. 2; Left: RR = 1. 8, 95 % CI, 1. 01, 3. 1). The sensitivity for visual inspection was 0. 7 for both ears; specificity was 0. 76 for the (R) and 0. 6 for the (L) ear. The mean difference in electrical skin resistance was 4. 3 MΩ (95 % CI, 1. 7, 6. 9) for the (L) ear; 4. 5 MΩ (95 % CI, 1. 5, 7. 6) for the (R) ear.

40|$|CONTEXT: The {{traumatic}} loss of an ear greatly {{affects the}} patient {{because of the}} severe aesthetic deformity it entails. The characteristic format of the ear, with a fine skin covering a thin and elastic cartilage, is not found {{anywhere else in the}} human body. Thus, to reconstruct an ear, the surgeon may try to imitate it by sculpting cartilage and covering it with skin. OBJECTIVE: To use a platysma myocutaneous flap for the reimplantation of a severed ear in humans. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Emergency unit of the university hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Ribeirão Preto - USP. CASE REPORT: Five cases are reported, with whole ear reimplantation in 3 of them and only segments in 2 cases. The surgical technique used was original and was based on the principle of <b>auricular</b> cartilage revascularization <b>using</b> the platysma muscle. We implanted traumatically severed auricular cartilage into the platysma muscle. The prefabricated ear was later transferred to its original site {{in the form of a}} myocutaneous-cartilaginous flap. Of the 5 cases treated using this technique, 4 were successful. In these 4 cases the reimplanted ears showed no short- or long-term problems, with an aesthetic result quite close to natural appearance. In one case there was necrosis of the entire flap, with total loss of the ear. The surgical technique described is simple and utilizes the severed ear of the patient. Its application is excellent for skin losses in the auricular region or for the ear itself, thus obviating the need for microsurgery or the use of protheses or grafts...|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} {{provides a}} promising alternative therapy {{to the complex}} surgical reconstruction of <b>auricular</b> cartilage by <b>using</b> ear-shaped autologous costal cartilage. Bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) is proposed as a promising scaffold material for auricular cartilage reconstruction, as it exhibits excellent biocompatibility and secures tissue integration. Thus, this study evaluates a novel bilayer BNC scaffold for auricular cartilage tissue engineering. Bilayer BNC scaffolds, composed of a dense nanocellulose layer joined with a macroporous composite layer of nanocellulose and alginate, were seeded with human nasoseptal chondrocytes (NC) and cultured invitro for up to 6 weeks. To scale up for clinical translation, bilayer BNC scaffolds were seeded with a low number of freshly isolated (uncultured) human NCs combined with freshly isolated human mononuclear cells (MNC) from bone marrow in alginate and subcutaneously implanted in nude mice for 8 weeks. 3 D morphometric analysis showed that bilayer BNC scaffolds have a porosity of 75 % and mean pore size of 50 ± 25 μm. Furthermore, endotoxin analysis and invitro cytotoxicity testing revealed that the produced bilayer BNC scaffolds were non-pyrogenic (0. 15 ± 0. 09 EU/ml) and non-cytotoxic (cell viability: 97. 8 ± 4. 7 %). This study demonstrates that bilayer BNC scaffolds offer a good mechanical stability and maintain a structural integrity while providing a porous architecture that supports cell ingrowth. Moreover, bilayer BNC scaffolds provide a suitable environment for culture-expanded NCs {{as well as a}} combination of freshly isolated NCs and MNCs to form cartilage invitro and invivo as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, biochemical and biomechanical analyses...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{outgrowth}} {{and aesthetics}} {{of the nose}} in children after reconstruction of the cartilaginous nasal septum with autologous cartilage grafts on polydioxanone plate. DESIGN: Prospective nonrandomized case series. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Six patients (5 boys and 1 girl), aged 3 to 11 years, with nasal septal abscess. INTERVENTION: The nasal septa of 6 children {{with a history of}} nasal septal abscess and partial or complete destruction of nasal septal cartilage were reconstructed with autologous cartilage grafts of the auricle or rib fixed on polydioxanone plate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nasal outgrowth was measured by the length of the nose and by the amount of nasal tip projection and was compared with standardized growth curves. Aesthetic outcome variables included nasolabial angle, columellar retraction, and development of saddle nose deformity and were classified as normal, mild, or severe. RESULTS: The duration of follow-up ranged from 10 to 68 months (mean follow-up, 38 months). Four children had complete loss of the cartilaginous septum. Areas 1 and 2 (caudal parts) had been destroyed in 2 children. <b>Auricular</b> cartilage was <b>used</b> in 5 children; costal cartilage was needed in 1 child. Compared with standardized growth curves, the length of the nose and the amount of nasal tip projection were within 1 SD in all children. None of the children developed saddle nose deformity. One child had mild columellar retraction; 3 children had mild overrotation of the nasal tip. CONCLUSION: Total reconstruction of abscess-induced destruction of nasal septal cartilage with autologous cartilage grafts fixed on polydioxanone plate has, so far, resulted in normal development of the nose during follow-up, without expected aesthetic problem...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: Selecting the {{appropriate}} technique for surgical incisions, and reconstruction of facial defects after skin tumour excision {{has always been}} one of the surgeon′s biggest concerns. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the results between the local flap and skin graft to reconstruct cheek defects after basal cell carcinoma excision. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective study, 40 patients with skin defects resulting from skin tumour (Basal cell carcinoma) excision in cheek zones (16 sub-orbital, 18 bucco-mandibular and six <b>auricular)</b> were treated <b>using</b> local flap (n = 20) and skin graft (n = 20) from October 2010 to April 2012. All patients were followed up for 12 months, postoperatively. In addition, general assessments including complications, patient satisfaction, tissue co-ordination, skin colour and hospitalisation days were obtained. Results: Five patients had postoperative hyper-pigmentation complication in the skin graft group and none occurred in the local flap (P = 0. 046). In the early postoperative period (2 weeks), mean scores in patient satisfaction, tissue co-ordination and skin colour were statistically significant increase in the local flaps (P < 0. 001, P < 0. 001, P < 0. 001, respectively) and in the later postoperative period (12 months) only mean scores in skin colour significantly increased in the local flaps (P < 0. 001). The mean postoperative length of hospitalisation days was 1. 7 ± 0. 4 days in the local flap group, and 3. 63 ± 1. 16 days in the skin graft group (P = 0. 001). Conclusion: In the local flap group: Patient satisfaction, tissue co-ordination and skin colour were improved after 2 weeks. Also in 12 -months follow up visits, skin colour was improved significantly and the hyperpigmentation was reduced. Generally, in this study the local flaps had better results in clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction.

40|$|Background: Auricular {{diagnosis}} {{has been}} used as a complementary approach that is simple, effective, and inexpensive for identifying chronic illnesses. This diagnostic method has prediagnostic value and is important for a secondary level of prevention, so that earlier treatment can be provided. Objective: This article describes how this diagnostic method was applied in cases with coronary heart disease (CHD) or lower urinary-tract symptoms (LUTS), which are common chronic illnesses among the adult population. Materials and Methods: Design: A case-control study approach was adopted, with the utilization of visual inspection, electrical skin-resistance measurement, and tenderness testing to investigate the auricular signals and their relationship with specific chronic illnesses. The practitioners who conducted the auricular diagnosis were blinded to the known medical conditions of the subjects. Setting and Subjects: Subjects from the CHD +ve (positive) group (n= 50) were recruited from the cardiac unit of a regional hospital in Hong Kong; whereas the subjects in the CHD -ve (negative; controls) group (n= 50) and participants in the LUTS study (LUTS +ve and LUTS -ve; n= 113) were recruited from the local community. Subjects with known health conditions were matched in age and gender with control subjects. Results: In the CHD study, the presence of an ear lobe crease was significantly associated with CHD. The Heart zone of the CHD +ve cases had significantly higher conductivity and had significant tenderness in both ears, compared with the control group. Similarly, nearly all of the specific acupoints in the participants in the LUTS +ve group indicated significantly higher conductivity and a tenderness sensation in the auricular areas associated with the kidneys and urinary tract than those in the LUTS -ve group. The predictive value of auricular signals for CHD/LUTS - which were detected by visual inspection, electrical skin-resistance measurement, and tenderness testing - was observed in a Chinese population. Conclusions: A systematic and scientific approach for the diagnostic accuracy of <b>auricular</b> signals involves <b>using</b> visual inspection, electrical skin-resistance measurement, and tenderness testing to investigate these signals and their relationship with specific chronic illnesses.
