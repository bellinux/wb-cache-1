40|$|Various {{genotoxic}} textile dyes, xenobiotics, substrates (10 µM) and agrochemicals (100 µg/ml) {{were tested}} for enhancement of alkalophilic laccase activity in&# 947;-proteobacterium JB. Neutral Red, Indigo Carmine, Naphthol Base Bordears and Sulphast Ruby dyes increased the activity by 3. 7, 2. 7, 2. 6 and 2. 3 fold respectively. Xenobiotics/substrates like p-toluidine, 8 -hydroxyquinoline and <b>anthracine</b> increased it by 3. 4, 2. 8 and 2. 3 fold respectively.

40|$|Almost {{half of the}} 4547 {{described}} bee flies (Bombyliidae: Diptera) in {{the world}} belong to the subfamily Anthracinae, {{with most of the}} world 2 ̆ 7 s diversity in three cosmopolitan tribes: Villini, Anthracini and Exoprosopini. Molecular data from 815 base pairs of 16 S mitochondrial DNA and morphological characters from species-groups of these tribes in Australia were analysed cladistically. The results show that the relationships between the <b>anthracine</b> tribes reflect those found in a previous morphological analysis. The genera of the Anthracinae in Australia are monophyletic, except for Ligyra Newman, and are assigned to tribes. Although simultaneous analysis of the combined molecular and morphological data produced clades found in both separate analyses, the different data sources are significantly incongruent. We use phylogenetic measures to examine support for the relationships among the Australian Anthracinae inferred by the molecular and morphological data...|$|E

Vários corantes têxteis genotóxicos, xenobióticos, substratos (10 mM) e agroquímicos (100 mM/mL) foram testados quanto ao aumento da atividade de lacase em &# 947;-Proteobacterium JB. Os corantes Neutral Red, Indigo Carmine, Naphtol Base Bordears e Sulphast Ruby aumentaram a atividade em 3, 7, 2, 7, 2, 6 e 2, 3 vezes, respectivamente. Xenobióticos/substratos como p-toluidina, 8 -hidroxiquinolina e antracina aumentaram a atividade em 3, 4, 2, 8 e 2, 3 vezes, respectivamente.
