50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of integrated <b>audio</b> analyzers, <b>audio</b> <b>generators</b> and <b>audio</b> analyzers were separate pieces of equipment. In this article, signal analyzer refers to the element of a modern audio analyzer that implements the actual measurements.|$|R
50|$|Other {{products}} {{include the}} PureSound software extension, {{for use with}} the Rapid-Test RT-2M dual channel, multi-tone Audio Frequency Analyzer, to provide test results for loudspeaker testing. The EXEL series handheld devices were introduced between 2006 and 2010. These were the XL2 Audio and Acoustic Analyzer, the Minirator MR2 and MR-PRO <b>audio</b> <b>generators,</b> the Digirator DR2 digital <b>audio</b> signal <b>generator</b> and the TalkBox acoustic generator used as a STIPA reference.

50|$|In 1995, Marcheschi {{reformed}} {{the group}} for live performances in San Francisco, with {{a new set of}} musicians. These performances led to the release of the album Live & Unreleased, which was followed in 1997 by a new studio album, Sing Like Scaffold. On the latter album, Fifty Foot Hose essentially comprised Marcheschi (on echolette, twin <b>audio</b> <b>generators,</b> squeaky stick, white noise generator, theremin, spark gap, and saw blades), Walter Funk III (jokers Ulysses and Cupid constructed by Fred 'Spaceman' Long, Bug (Tom Nunn), vocoder, Hologlyphic Funkaliser and other electronix), Reid Johnston (guitube, guitar, tools, horns, harmonium, hardware, bikewheel), Lenny Bove (bass, electronics, vocals), Elizabeth Perry (vocals), and Dean Cook (drums).|$|R

40|$|Laboratory and {{in-flight}} {{experiments were}} conducted to evaluate 3 -D audio display technology for cockpit applications. A 3 -D <b>audio</b> display <b>generator</b> was developed which digitally encodes naturally occurring direction information onto any audio signal and presents the binaural sound over headphones. The acoustic image is stabilized for head movement by use of an electromagnetic head-tracking device. In the laboratory, a 3 -D <b>audio</b> display <b>generator</b> was used to spatially separate competing speech messages to improve the intelligibility of each message. Up to a 25 percent improvement in intelligibility was measured for spatially separated speech at high ambient noise levels (115 dB SPL). During the in-flight experiments, pilots reported that spatial separation of speech communications provided a noticeable improvement in intelligibility. The use of 3 -D audio for target acquisition was also investigated. In the laboratory, 3 -D audio enabled the acquisition of visual targets in about two seconds average response time at 17 degrees accuracy. During the in-flight experiments, pilots correctly identified ground targets 50, 75, and 100 {{percent of the time}} at separation angles of 12, 20, and 35 degrees, respectively. In general, pilot performance in the field with the 3 -D <b>audio</b> display <b>generator</b> was as expected, based on data from laboratory experiments...|$|R

50|$|The signal {{analyzer}} {{can provide}} control {{to both the}} <b>audio</b> <b>generator</b> and the audio input stages, assuring that test conditions are met. This also permits precise time relationships between the stimulus and response of a DUT to be determined.|$|E
50|$|Equipment {{distortion}} can {{be measured}} using a very-low-distortion <b>audio</b> <b>generator</b> as the signal source, with appropriate equipment to measure output distortion harmonic-by-harmonic with a wave analyser, or simply total harmonic distortion.

5000|$|The basic {{organization}} of each news broadcast {{is called a}} [...] "rundown" [...] (US) or [...] "running order" [...] (UK). The run-down is a grid listing scripts, video, <b>audio,</b> character <b>generator</b> data, teleprompter control, director notations, camera operator cues, and timing estimates for each section of the broadcast.|$|R
50|$|If {{more than}} one {{application}} is sending audio through an output virtual cable, VAC is able to mix all of the streams together or create separate corresponding virtual input cables. Similarly, {{more than one}} application is able to receive audio from an input cable, whether it's sharing the same audio data with another target or receiving its own personal audio stream. VAC is useful for recording an application's audio output in almost real time or transferring a sound stream to another application so it may process it. A person could use two or more software <b>audio</b> <b>generators,</b> synthesizers or sequencers to produce audio streams {{and send them to}} a VAC output cable and record the mixed stream from the VAC input cable using any type of recording software.|$|R

50|$|Through the 1940s {{and into}} the 1950s, the {{subsequent}} versions of the 200A covered different and wider frequency ranges. The latest version was the 200CD; it covered from the subaudio 5 Hz to {{the low end of}} the AM radio band at 600 kilohertz. The 200CD became a ubiquitous <b>audio</b> <b>generator</b> in engineering laboratories worldwide from the 1950s to the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|In some situations, {{overwriting}} {{circular buffer}} can be used, e.g. in multimedia. If the buffer {{is used as}} the bounded buffer in the producer-consumer problem then it is probably desired for the producer (e.g., an <b>audio</b> <b>generator)</b> to overwrite old data if the consumer (e.g., the sound card) is unable to momentarily keep up. Also, the LZ77 family of lossless data compression algorithms operates {{on the assumption that}} strings seen more recently in a data stream are more likely to occur soon in the stream. Implementations store the most recent data in a circular buffer.|$|E
50|$|Buchla's first modular {{electronic}} music system {{was the result}} of a San Francisco Tape Music Center commission by composers Ramon Sender and Morton Subotnick in 1963, who later allotted $500 from a Rockefeller Foundation grant to Buchla in 1964. Subotnick envisioned a voltage-controlled instrument that would allow musicians and composers to create sounds suited to their own specifications. Previously, one had to use either discrete <b>audio</b> <b>generators,</b> such as test oscillators—or musique concrète, recorded sounds from natural sources. Buchla designed the synthesizer in a modular fashion, combining separate components that each generated or modified a music event. Each box served a specific function: envelope generators, oscillators, filters, voltage controlled amplifiers, and analog sequencer modules. Utilizing the different modules, a composer could affect the pitch, timbre, amplitude, and spatial location of the sound. The instrument was controlled and played via an array of touch and pressure-sensitive surfaces.|$|R

The proposed circuit employs a power efficient buck-boost converter with a diode voltage multiplier as a start-up circuit. The overall AC-to-DC converter can start and run autonomously from an <b>audio</b> signal <b>generator,</b> such as an audio jack. Experimental {{results showed that the}} prototype converter could achieve a power conversion efficiency of 45 % when applying a 5 -kHz input signal...|$|R

40|$|Part 1 : Decision Support Systems, Intelligent Systems and Artificial Intelligence ApplicationsInternational audienceThere are studies {{indicate}} that audible sound wave could have effects on propagation growth through catalyzing hearing sense organs, which would bring a series of physiological and biological chemistry reaction. The sound-pressure level and frequency are important factors in propagation growth. In this study, an experimental system of <b>audio</b> <b>generator</b> was developed for investigating sound wave effect on propagation growth promotion, and an embedded development platform based on ARM+DSP+FPGA was built for the system. The DDFS(Direct Digital Frequency Synthesis) method was used to make various waveforms in the system. A feedback analysis networks was added in the system for reliable output of sound waves. Results show that the <b>audio</b> <b>generator</b> system can produce sound waves with frequency of 20 Hz~ 20, 000 Hz accurately and make octave analysis of the sound in experimental environments.

50|$|One of {{the most}} common gain-stabilized {{circuits}} is the Wien bridge oscillator. In this circuit, two RC circuits are used, one with the RC components in series and one with the RC components in parallel. The Wien Bridge is often used in <b>audio</b> signal <b>generators</b> because it can be easily tuned using a two-section variable capacitor or a two section variable potentiometer (which is more easily obtained than a variable capacitor suitable for generation at low frequencies). The archetypical HP200A audio oscillator is a Wien Bridge oscillator.|$|R
