5|$|Equine {{species can}} crossbreed with each other. The most common hybrid is the mule, {{a cross between}} a male donkey <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> horse. With rare exceptions, these hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce. A related hybrid, a hinny, is {{a cross between a}} male horse <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> donkey. Other hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and a horse and a zonkey or zedonk, a hybrid of a zebra and a donkey. In areas where Grévy's zebras are {{sympatric}} with plains zebras, fertile hybrids do occur.|$|E
5|$|For the 1893 version a {{baritone}} solo, two bassoons, four {{horns and}} two trumpets {{are added to}} the original scoring. When possible Fauré employed a mixed choir <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> soprano soloist, partly because the soprano lines, particularly the solo in the , are difficult to sing and demand excellent breath control, easier for adult women than for boys.|$|E

5|$|The Marshall Islands were {{represented}} by a male athlete <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> athlete in athletics at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Roman William Cress and Haley Nemra. This was the first appearance for either athlete at the Olympics. Neither Nemara or Cress met the qualification criteria for their events, however they were accepted as wildcard entries into the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera cuts {{to a shot}} of them on the couch, then zooms out to show this as a picture hanging on the wall of a fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, stock {{abutments}} {{are used}} to retain dentures using a male-adapter attached to the implant <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> adapter in the denture. Two common types of adapters are the ball-and-socket style retainer and the button-style adapter. These types of stock abutments allow movement of the denture, but enough retention {{to improve the quality}} of life for denture wearers, compared to conventional dentures. Regardless of the type of adapter, the female portion of the adapter that is housed in the denture will require periodic replacement, however the number and adapter type does not seem to affect patient satisfaction with the prosthetic for various removable alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Breeding convicts is {{as simple}} as having a male <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> in the same tank with {{adequate}} water quality and feeding. There is no special conditioning required. Due to their prolific breeding in captivity, there is a very low demand for Convict fry, and one may easily find their aquarium overstocked with an inbreeding population of Convicts without any avenues for adoption.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at around {{three or four}} years of age and males at around five; however, males often do not {{successfully}} breed until a few years later. A captive male sired offspring at age 19. In the wild, sea otters live to a maximum age of 23 years, with average lifespans of 10–15 years for males and 15–20 years for females. Several captive individuals have lived past 20 years, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> at the Seattle Aquarium {{died at the age of}} 28 years. Sea otters in the wild often develop worn teeth, which may account for their apparently shorter lifespans.|$|E

5|$|Gopalam, the zamindar of Appapuram, is the {{principal}} {{of a high school}} named after his elder daughter Mahalakshmi. As a child, she went missing during a pilgrimage to the Godavari River pushkaram in Kakinada. Conditions at the school deteriorate due to mismanagement by Gopalam's nephew, A. K. Raju, an amateur detective. This is exacerbated when Panthulu, an ayurvedic doctor, teaches the children. Gopalam decides to replace them with a male <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> graduate (preferably a married couple) capable of training his younger daughter Sita in singing besides teaching children at the school.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, {{the protagonist}} <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> {{accomplice}} rent a home {{like the one}} Cox and Hauck rented in Atlanta. The character then opens accounts at several banks in the area {{so that he can}} use them for money laundering purposes, which Cox did. Then, Cox, like the character in the manuscript, forged a document, claiming that the mortgage on the home—which he did not even own—was paid off. The character in the manuscript then contacted lenders, and told them he owned the property outright. Cox is in prison for this same crime.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April 1986, {{a healthy}} hybrid kitten between a male serval <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> {{domestic}} cat was born; this kitten {{was larger than}} a typical domestic kitten and resembled its father in its coat pattern. It appeared to have inherited a few domestic traits, such as tameness, from its mother. The hybrid cat may have a doglike habit of following its owner about, and {{can be a good}} swimmer. Over the years, savannah cats have gained popularity as pets.|$|E

5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} {{in the blue}} wildebeest is 58. Chromosomes were studied in a male <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> wildebeest. In the female, all except a pair of very large submetacentric chromosomes {{were found to be}} acrocentric. Metaphases were studied in the male's chromosomes, and very large submetacentric chromosomes were found there as well, similar to those in the female both in size and morphology. the rest were acrocentric. The X chromosome is a large acrocentric while the Y chromosome a minute one.|$|E
5|$|Trade {{was also}} an {{important}} economic activity for the pre-Akkadian kingdom of Nagar, which had Ebla and Kish as major partners. The kingdom produced glass, wool, and was famous for breeding and trading in the Kunga, a hybrid of a donkey <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> onager. Tell Brak remained an important commercial center during the Akkadian period, {{and was one of}} Mitanni's main trade cities. Many objects were manufactured in Mitannian Tell Brak, including furniture made of ivory, wood and bronze, in addition to glass. The city provided evidence for the international commercial contacts of Mitanni, including Egyptian, Hittite and Mycenaean objects, some of which were produced in the region to satisfy the local taste.|$|E
5|$|Two of the 8th century picture stones {{from the}} island of Gotland, Sweden depict eight-legged horses, which are thought by most {{scholars}} to depict Sleipnir: the Tjängvide image stone and the Ardre VIII image stone. Both stones feature a rider sitting atop an eight-legged horse, which some scholars view as Odin. Above the rider on the Tjängvide image stone is a horizontal figure holding a spear, which may be a valkyrie, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> figure greets the rider with a cup. The scene has been interpreted as a rider arriving at {{the world of the}} dead. The mid-7th century Eggja stone bearing the Odinic name haras (Old Norse 'army god') may be interpreted as depicting Sleipnir.|$|E

5|$|After AD 700 {{the pyramid}} served an {{important}} funerary function. Three elite burials have been excavated from the pyramid, two males <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female,</b> accompanied by extremely high quality funerary offerings. The offerings include polychrome ceramics and objects crafted from shell, conch {{and mother of}} pearl that are inscribed with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic imagery. These associated finds are of sufficient quality {{that it is possible}} that the deceased were members of the royal family. The burials have been dated to the reign of YaxNuunAyiinII, who ruled from AD 769 to 794. During the Terminal Classic some minor changes were made to the temple chambers and there may have been structural reinforcement of the front of the temple. Although it is poorly preserved, the inside of the temple rooms were inscribed with graffiti that is likely to date to this time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the ideal}} ages for {{marriage}} were thirty {{for a man}} and twenty for a woman, it was common for a male to marry at age sixteen <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> at age fourteen. To encourage families to marry off their daughters, a law was introduced in 189 BCE that increased the poll tax rate fivefold for unmarried {{women between the ages}} of fifteen and thirty. People of the Han practiced a strict form of exogamy where one could not marry a person who had the same surname, even if both partners could not be traced back to a common ancestor (however, this excluded the royal family, who sometimes married distant relatives for political reasons). Officials often married into families with officials of equal status and sometimes married royal princesses or had their daughters marry kings and even the emperor.|$|E
5|$|At street level, three arched entranceways line Broad Street. The central arch is {{slightly}} larger than the others to indicate {{the entrance to the}} main banking hall. Carved into the facade above the center arch is the building's name. Inside the arches and above the doorways are windows designed by d'Ascenzo Studios. Leaded panes of glass of various shades of amber are surrounded by a Renaissance-style border. Below the windows are bronze doors, each with 24 high-relief panels depicting the history of commerce and civilization. Bas-relief figures decorate each of the arches' spandrels. A male figure with a hammer representing industry <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> figure with a beehive representing thrift decorate the center arch. The arch closest to Sansom Street is decorated by two figures with cornucopias to represent abundance. The arch nearer to Walnut Street is decorated by a painter and a sculptor to represent art.|$|E
