25|$|Snow goggles (niguak ~ niiguak dual or nigaugek dual nigauget pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, igguag in Cup'ig) is old-style snow goggles {{made out}} of wood with narrow slits, which admit only <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>light.</b> Snow goggles were carved from {{driftwood}} (esp. spruce), walrus ivory, bone or caribou antler, and sometimes made with coarse seashore grass. They always paint the inside of goggles black, so our eyes won’t be bothered by the glare and can stay wide open. goggles were created in various styles by artists from different regions, and they often resembled animals underscoring a pervasive Native theme of human-animal transformation. Some snow goggles are carved {{in the form of}} an animal mask. Arctic foxes have keen eyesight for hunting on the land and sea ice, a quality that the mask/goggles may have been intended to transfer to the person wearing them. The goggles with narrow slits not only protect the eyes from excess light, but also sharpen and focus vision, like a pinhole camera. Some goggles have large eye openings and are blackened with soot inside to eliminate reflections. Snow goggles are an ancient element of Eskimo hunting cultures, appearing in archaeological sites up to 2000 years old.|$|E

[...] "We noticed the material lit up on its own," [...] Donner explained. [...] "We tore the material into tiny pieces and glued it on the costumes, designing a front projection effect for each camera. There was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>light</b> on each camera, and it would project into a mirror, bounce {{out in front of the}} lens, hit the costume, [...] millions of little glass beads would light up and bring the image back into the camera." ...|$|E
500|$|Within {{the novel}} itself, {{the title is}} alluded to when Gail Hightower sits at his study window waiting for his {{recurring}} vision of his grandfather's last raid. The vision always occurs in [...] "that instant when all light has failed {{out of the sky}} and it would be night save for that faint light which daygranaried leaf and grass blade reluctant suspire, making still <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>light</b> on earth though night itself has come." [...] The story that would eventually become the novel, started by Faulkner in 1931, was originally titled [...] "Dark House" [...] and began with Hightower sitting at a dark window in his home. However, after a casual remark by his wife Estelle {{on the quality of the}} light in August, Faulkner changed the title.|$|E

500|$|The album {{features}} more positive and uplifting lyrics {{in comparison with}} Green Day's earlier work. Cool noted that, [...] "It's got the sarcasm, it's got the snottiness, but it's got <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>light</b> {{at the end of}} the tunnel." [...] Warning also contains more explicitly political themes, as exemplified by tracks such as [...] "Minority". [...] This was inspired by Armstrong's fear that presidential nominee Al Gore was going to lose the 2000 U.S. presidential election and that [...] "someone really conservative" [...] would take office. He recalled, [...] "We've always tried to keep an ear to the ground and keep our eyes open to what's going on...that's one reason why I was really taking my time writing songs to really [...] Instead of just writing an overly knee-jerk reaction." [...] According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the lyrics of [...] "Minority" [...] serve as [...] "a reminder of the youthful mentality of Green Day's early work". [...] "Misery" [...] tells various stories in its verses, all of which end unhappily. The first verse centers on a girl named Virginia who was a [...] "lot lizard", a term for a prostitute who exchanges sex for money with truck drivers at interstate highway truck stops. [...] "Blood, Sex and Booze" [...] explores the subject of sadomasochism.|$|E

[...] Destructoid's Brad Nicholson also agreed, stating [...] "With only four tables, {{all of which can}} be accessed from the very beginning, Zen Pinball feels <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>light</b> on variety." [...] Six additional tables were later released as downloadable content. [...] Nicholson, however, went on to praise solid table design and functionality.

2500|$|In {{recognition}} of Torquay’s impressive {{start to the}} season, Paul Buckle was named League Two Manager of the Month for August. [...] However, after a near perfect August, September was to prove something of a reality check for the Gulls. [...] With Torquay’s clean sheet record ending against Port Vale in their previous match, a 2-1 defeat away to Southend in their {{first game of the}} month put to an end a twelve match unbeaten run in the League which had stretched back to March. [...] This was then followed up by two successive 0-0 draws at home to Accrington Stanley and away to Stevenage. [...] Although these results seemed to suggest the Gulls had got their defensive house back in the order, they were now struggling to find the back of the net. [...] With summer signings Billy Kee and Martin Gritton yet to register on the goalscorer charts, and Elliot Benyon out injured for the Accrington game and on the bench for most of the Stevenage match, the Gulls were starting to look <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>light</b> up front, despite the best efforts of the versatile Chris Zebroski who was being employed as both winger and striker.|$|E
