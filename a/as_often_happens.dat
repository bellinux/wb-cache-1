5|$|The first scenes {{depicting}} Tyrion descending with Bronn {{from the}} Mountains of the Moon and encountering the clansmen were not written by Martin. Since {{they were originally}} intended {{to be part of}} episode seven, they were written by that episode's authors, David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. <b>As</b> <b>often</b> <b>happens</b> in TV production, the scene was moved from one episode to another during editing.|$|E
25|$|Latin names {{can also}} be adopted unchanged, or modified; in particular, the inflected element can be dropped, <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>happens</b> in {{borrowings}} from Latin to English. Examples: Laura, Victoria, Marcus, Justin (Latin Justinus), Paul (Lat. Paulus), Julius, Cecilia, Felix, Julia, Pascal (not a traditional-type Latin name, but the adjective-turned-name paschalis, meaning 'of Easter' (Pascha)).|$|E

25|$|Physicians {{sometimes}} use {{the term}} palliative care in a sense meaning palliative therapies without curative intent, when no cure can be expected (<b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>happens</b> in late-stage cancers). For example, tumor debulking can continue to reduce pain from mass effect {{even when it is}} no longer curative. A clearer usage is palliative, noncurative therapy when that is what is meant, because palliative care can be used along with curative or aggressive therapies.|$|E
25|$|National policymakers have {{recently}} shifted their position and publicly acknowledged {{the extent and}} pattern of increasing drug use, {{which has led to}} a rapid increase in treatment options for drug users. According to the regulations on the prohibition of narcotics, drug users identified by authorities for the first time are fined or sent to a voluntary detoxification center run by the health system, which might include short-term use of methadone, buprenorphine, or traditional Chinese medicine. Detoxification costs 2000–5000 yuan (about US$250–625) for one phase of treatment. If, <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>happens,</b> the treatment is not successful, relapsing patients identified by authorities are sent to a compulsory rehabilitation center, administered by the Ministry of Public Security, for 3–6 months. Those with multiple relapses are detained in a re-education-through-labor center, managed by the Ministry of Justice, for 1–3 years. In reality, internment procedures and durations vary enormously between administrative units. In general, centers focus on detoxification. Although some health education or treatment is provided, the relapse rate is extremely high.|$|E
25|$|By January 1956, the U-2 so {{impressed}} the USAF that {{it decided to}} obtain its own aircraft. The USAF purchased a total of 31 U-2s through the CIA; the transaction's code name, Project Dragon Lady, was {{the origin of the}} aircraft's nickname. Meanwhile, U-2s conducted eight overflights of the U.S. in April 1956, convincing project overseers that the aircraft was ready for deployment. <b>As</b> <b>often</b> <b>happens</b> with new aircraft designs, there were several operational accidents. One occurred during these test flights, when a U-2 suffered a flameout over Tennessee; the pilot calculated that he could reach New Mexico. Every air base in the continental U.S. had sealed orders on what to do if a U-2 landed. The commander of Kirtland Air Force Base near Albuquerque, New Mexico was told to open his orders, prepare for the arrival of an unusual aircraft making a deadstick landing, and get it inside a hangar as soon as possible. The U-2 successfully landed after gliding for more than , and its strange, glider-like appearance and the space-suited pilot startled the base commander and other witnesses.|$|E

25|$|General Brusilov's initial {{orders were}} for Austrian laws {{to remain in}} effect and for Austrian {{officials}} to continue their duties – {{in the name of}} the Russian tsar instead of the Austrian emperor – as long as they would not be suspected of possible treason to the new Russian authorities. This policy proved difficult, because many Austrian officials had fled, and because the loyalty to Russia of those who remained was in doubt. Initially local Galician Russophiles were used to staff positions. However, in time the bureaucracy came to be staffed overwhelmingly by officlals transferred in from neighboring regions of the Russian Empire. <b>As</b> <b>often</b> <b>happens</b> in such reassignments, the bureaucrats of the neighboring regions took advantage of the opportunity to transfer out those with the least amount of ability, experience, education as well as those who caused trouble. As a result, in addition to understaffing the Russian administration in Galicia suffered from poor quality in personnel. Many of the transferees belonged to right-wing Russian nationalist parties who espoused anti-Semitism as well as hostility towards Ukrainians and Poles.|$|E

Music journalist Chuck Eddy described the song as [...] "a sort of Black Sabbath punk rock." [...] Though rumors of the album's third track, [...] "The KKK Took My Baby Away", being about Johnny stealing Joey's girlfriend have circulated {{in the music}} business, the song was actually written some time before Joey had reportedly found out about this. Joey's brother Mickey Leigh relates: [...] "The fluky connection between Johnny and the KKK raised a specter that keeps friends and fans speculating to this day. At the time, though, {{it had to be}} an unusual situation for him being that, <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>happens</b> with song lyrics, his words now took on a whole new meaning." [...] The following track, [...] "Don't Go", was described in Musician, Player, and Listener as [...] "Spector-ish", referring to the song's high production value through Phil Spector, the infamous producer of the band's previous record, End of the Century. According to the book, the lyrics detail [...] "an archivist's sense of young love by the book and how innocent rock 'n' roll is supposed to sound." [...] Everett True, author of Hey Ho Let's Go: The Story of the Ramones (2005), explains that the album's fifth track, [...] "You Sound Like You're Sick", is very bass incorporated, saying that it [...] "returns to the bassist's traditional institutionalised theme." [...] Side A ends with [...] "It's Not My Place (In the 9 to 5 World)", which was described by music critic David Fricke to be [...] "driven home" [...] by drummer Marky's [...] "feisty, Bo Diddley-style" [...] drum beat, and noted that it borrows the middle eight (of thirty-two-bar form) from The Who song [...] "Whiskey Man".|$|E

2500|$|Certain metals can be {{recovered}} from their ores by simply heating the rocks in a fire: notably tin, lead and (at a higher temperature) copper, {{a process known}} as smelting. The first evidence of this extractive metallurgy dates from the 5th and 6th millenniumBC, and was found in the archaeological sites of Majdanpek, Yarmovac and Plocnik, all three in Serbia. To date, the earliest copper smelting is found at the Belovode site, these examples include a copper axe from 5500 BC belonging to the Vinča culture. Other signs of early metals are found from the third millenniumBC in places like Palmela (Portugal), Los Millares (Spain), and Stonehenge (United Kingdom). However, <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>happens</b> with the study of prehistoric times, the ultimate beginnings cannot be clearly defined and new discoveries are ongoing.|$|E

After calling Jamie a [...] "hopeless failure" [...] Mary warns that his bad influence will drag his brother down as well. After seeing the condition that his wife is in, her husband expresses the regret that he bothered to come home, and he attempts to ignore her as she continues her remarks, which include blaming him for Jamie’s drinking, and noting that the Irish are stupid drunks. Then, <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>happens</b> in the play, Mary and James try to get over their animosity and attempt to express their love for one another by remembering happier days.

2500|$|CF {{patients}} {{may also have}} their airways chronically colonized by filamentous fungi (such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Scedosporium apiospermum, Aspergillus terreus) and/or yeasts (such as Candida albicans); other filamentous fungi less commonly isolated include Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus nidulans (occur transiently in CF respiratory secretions) and Exophiala dermatitidis and Scedosporium prolificans (chronic airway-colonizers); some filamentous fungi such as Penicillium emersonii and Acrophialophora fusispora are encountered in patients almost exclusively {{in the context of}} CF. Defective mucociliary clearance characterizing CF is associated with local immunological disorders. In addition, the prolonged therapy with antibiotics and the use of corticosteroid treatments may also facilitate fungal growth. Although the clinical relevance of the fungal airway colonization is still a matter of debate, filamentous fungi may contribute to the local inflammatory response and therefore to the progressive deterioration of the lung function, <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>happens</b> with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [...] – the most common fungal disease in the context of CF, involving a Th2-driven immune response to Aspergillus species.|$|E
2500|$|Compulsory voting {{has also}} been {{promoted}} for its collective benefits. [...] It becomes difficult for coercion {{to be used to}} prevent disadvantaged people (the old, illiterate or disabled) to vote, and for obstacles to be put in the way of classes of individuals (ethnic/coloured; either registration requirements or placement of voting booths) <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>happens</b> under other voting systems. The compulsion requirement also needs to be kept in proportion: jury duty and compulsory military service are vastly more onerous citizen's compulsions [...] than attending a local voting booth once every few years. Perhaps the most compelling reason to use a system of compulsory voting is a simple matter of logistics, that is, to facilitate the smooth and orderly process of an election. Every year in countries that do not have compulsory voting election officials have to guess at the numbers of voters who might turn out – this often depends on the vagaries of the weather. Often voters are disenfranchied in those countries when voting officials err and not enough voting booths are provided. Long queues can result with voters being turned away at the close of polling not having had their chance to exercise their democratic right to vote.|$|E
2500|$|Eugene was a disciplinarian—when {{ordinary}} soldiers disobeyed orders he {{was prepared}} to shoot them himself—but he rejected blind brutality, writing [...] "you should only be harsh when, <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>happens,</b> kindness proves useless". On the battlefield Eugene demanded courage in his subordinates, and expected his men to fight where and when he wanted; his criteria for promotion were based primarily on obedience to orders and courage on the battlefield rather than social position. On the whole his men responded because he was willing to push himself as hard as them. However, his position as President of the Imperial War Council proved less successful. Following the long period of peace after the Austro-Turkish War, the idea of creating a separate field army or providing garrison troops with effective training for them to be turned into such an army quickly was never considered by Eugene. By the time of the War of the Polish Succession, therefore, the Austrians were outclassed by a better prepared French force. For this Eugene was largely to blame—in his view (unlike the drilling and manoeuvres carried out by the Prussians which to Eugene seemed irrelevant to real warfare) the time to create actual fighting men was when war came. But although Frederick the Great had been struck by the muddle of the Austrian army and its poor organisation during the Polish Succession war, he later amended his initial harsh judgements. [...] "If I understand anything of my trade," [...] commented Frederick in 1758, [...] "especially in the more difficult aspects, I owe that advantage to Prince Eugene. From him I learnt to hold grand objectives constantly in view, and direct all my resources to those ends." [...] To historian Christopher Duffy it was this awareness of the 'grand strategy' that was Eugene's legacy to Frederick.|$|E
