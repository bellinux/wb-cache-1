40|$|We {{present the}} first {{experimental}} demonstration of a multiple-radiofrequency dressed {{potential for the}} configurable magnetic confinement of ultracold atoms. In a scheme {{that can be easily}} extended by the application of additional dressing frequencies, we load cold $^{ 87 }$Rb atoms into a double well potential with an <b>adjustable</b> <b>barrier</b> height, formed by three independently-generated frequencies. Our multiple-radiofrequency approach allows for precise control over the double well potential, including the depth of individual wells and the height of the barrier, and enables reliable transfer of atoms between the available trapping geometries. We have characterised the multiple-radiofrequency dressed system using radiofrequency spectroscopy, finding good agreement with the eigenvalues numerically calculated using Floquet theory. This method can be used to create arbitrary connected trapping potentials as well as magnetic lattice structures with individually addressed lattice sites. Comment: 16 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|Hot {{electrons}} {{and the associated}} ballistic and quasiballistic transport, heretofore neglected endemically, across the active regions of InGaN light emitting diodes (LEDs) have been incorporated into a first order simple model which explains the experimental observations of electron spillover and the efficiency degradation at high injection levels. The model is in good agreement with experiments wherein an <b>adjustable</b> <b>barrier</b> hot electron stopper, commonly called the electron blocking layer (EBL), is incorporated. The model is also in agreement with experiments wherein the electrons are cooled, eliminating hot electrons, inside a staircase electron injector (SEI) prior to their injection into the active region. Thermionic emission from the active region, even if one uses an uncharacteristically high junction temperature of 1000 K, fails {{to account for the}} carrier spillover and the experimental observations in our laboratory in samples with varying EBL barrier heights. The model has been successfully applied to both m-plane (lacking polarization induced electric field) and c-plane (with polarization induced field) InGaN double heterostructure (DH) LEDs with a 6 nm active region featuring a variable barrier hot electron stopper, and a SEI, and the various combinations thereof. The choice of DH LEDs stems from our desire to keep the sample structure simple as well as the model calculations. In this paper, the theoretical and experimental data along with their comparison followed by an insightful discussion are given. The model and the approaches to eliminate carrier spillover proposed here for InGaN LEDs are also applicable to GaN-based laser diodes...|$|E

We find a fractionally quantized Hall conductance for integer filling factor in {{the bulk of the}} 2 DEG, {{as a consequence of the}} fractional filling factor in the probes. We argue that this effect is the first manifestation of adiabatic transport in the FQHE.

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{thermodynamics}} of interactions between surfaces mediated by polymer-tethered ligand-receptor binding. From statistical thermodynamics calculations, we obtain an effective two-dimensional binding constant reflecting {{contributions from the}} microscopic binding affinity {{as well as from}} the conformation entropy of the polymer tethers. The total interaction is a result of the interplay between attractive binding and repulsion due to confinement of the polymer chains. We illustrate the differences between three scenarios when the binding molecules are (1) immobile, (2) mobile with a fixed density, and (3) mobile with a fixed chemical potential (connected to a reservoir), which correspond to different biological or experimental situations. The key features of interactions, including the range of adhesion (onset of binding) and the equilibrium separation, can be obtained from scaling analysis and are verified by numerical solutions. In addition, we also extend our method of treating the quenched case with immobile ligands and receptors developed in a previous paper [Martin, J. I.; Zhang, C. -Z.; Wang, Z. -G. J. Polym. Sci., Part B: Polym. Phys. 2006, 44, 2621 − 2637] as a density expansion in terms of both ligand and receptor densities. Finally, we examine several cases having ligand-receptor pairs with different tether lengths and binding affinities, and/or nonbinding linear polymers as steric repellers. Such systems can exhibit complex interactions such as a double-well potential, or a bound state with an <b>adjustable</b> <b>barrier</b> (due to the repellers), which have both biological and bioengineering relevance...|$|E

The extended model incorporates a default barrier with dynamics {{depending on the}} volatility and the drift of the signaling variable. The level of the barrier is adjusted by a free parameter. We derive a closed-form solution of the defaultable bond price {{as a function of}} a signaling variable and a short-term interest rate, with time-dependent model parameters governing the dynamics of the signaling variable and interest rate. The numerical results calculated from the solution show that the risk <b>adjustable</b> default <b>barrier</b> has material impact on the term structures of credit spreads.

40|$|Graphene-based {{materials}} have attracted considerable interest {{due to their}} potential use in {{a broad range of}} applications including membrane separations, electronic devices and biomaterials. Their performance in many of these applications relies on the ability to precisely control the layer number and density of films over large areas. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) {{is one of the most}} promising methods to produce single layer graphene. However, the high cost, limited choice of substrates and error-prone transfer processes limit its application. On the other hand, laboratory-scale film processing approaches like spin/spray-coating, filtration and drop-casting are incapable of producing films with nanometer-scale control of film thickness and uniformity and/or over the large length scales required for many applications. Recently, the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) deposition technique has been applied to graphene and graphene oxide with some success. In this method, the material is dispersed at the air-water interface, the floating material, held up by surface tension, is densified by the compression of two floating barriers and the resulting film is transferred onto substrates by dip coating. While good control over layer number and film density has been achieved, the technique is currently limited to small area films and suffers from the challenge that only ~ 1 % of the material is retained at the interface during transfer while the rest is lost in the sub-phase. In this work, we developed a directed assembly process for producing GO monolayers at the air-water interface which assemble into densely tiled films without the requirement to use <b>adjustable</b> <b>barriers.</b> We demonstrate that the resulting directional film growth is amenable to roll-to-roll fabrication. By choosing a suitable spreading solvent, we obtained high-yield transfer to the air-water interface measuring Langmuir surface areas as high as 800  m 2 /g. Furthermore, we used both in situ Brewster angle microscopy and a custom-made Langmuir-Adam balance to study the mechanism of film formation. We also successfully extended our process to monolayer films of other 2 D nanomaterials such as MoS 2. As a first example of the utility of these films, we deposit dense GO monolayers onto silver nanowire transparent electrodes and demonstrate their ability to protect the nanowires from degrading under high currents...|$|R
40|$|Tunable charge-trapping {{behaviors}} including unipolar charge trapping of {{one type}} of charge carrier and ambipolar trapping of both electrons and holes in a complementary manner is highly desirable for low power consumption multibit flash memory design. Here, we adopt a strategy of tuning the Fermi level of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through self-assembled monolayer (SAM) functionalization and form p-type and n-type doped rGO {{with a wide range}} of manipulation on work function. The functionalized rGO can act as charge-trapping layer in ambipolar flash memories, and a dramatic transition of charging behavior from unipolar trapping of electrons to ambipolar trapping and eventually to unipolar trapping of holes was achieved. <b>Adjustable</b> hole/electron injection <b>barriers</b> induce controllable Vth shift in the memory transistor after programming operation. Finally, we transfer the ambipolar memory on flexible substrates and study their charge-trapping properties at various bending cycles. The SAM-functionalized rGO can be a promising candidate for next-generation nonvolatile memories...|$|R
40|$|Mixed-valence manganites La 1 −xAxMnO 3 (A=Sr, Ca) with x≈ 0. 5 can {{be driven}} from a ferromagnetic-metallic to an antiferromagnetic-insulating state {{by a small}} {{modification}} (Δx) of the carrier density (Δx/x< 1). For this reason, these oxides have received renewed attention due to their potentially advantageous integration in ferroelectric tunnel junctions of <b>adjustable</b> tunnel <b>barrier</b> width. Interestingly, in thin films, epitaxial strain can modify the electronic and magnetic ground state strongly affecting their magnetotransport properties. Here we exploit the extreme sensitivity of linearly and circularly polarized x-ray absorption to orbital anisotropy and magnetic ordering to explore the role of structural distortions and electronic bandwidth on the orbital occupancy and spin ordering of Mn[*] 3 d states in La 0. 5 A 0. 5 MnO 3 films under various strain states. Mn 55 NMR experiments are used to get information about the electronic and magnetic phase separation and orbital ordering occurring in these films. These results combined with the corresponding structural, magnetic, and electrical characterization allow us to map the strain-dependent orbital and magnetic phase diagrams of half-doped manganites and its dependence on the electronic bandwidth.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{relation}} {{for the work}} of critical cluster formation in nucleation theory W for the systems with long-range interparticle interactions. The method of bridge functions is used to combine the system behavior at sufficiently small quenches, adequately predicted by the classical nucleation theory, with nonclassical effects at deep quenches {{in the vicinity of the}} thermodynamic spinodal, described within the framework of the field theoretical approach with an appropriate Ginzburg-Landau functional. The crossover between the two types of nucleation behavior takes place in the vicinity of the kinetic spinodal where the lifetime of a metastable state is of the order of the relaxation time to local equilibrium. We argue that the kinetic spinodal corresponds to the minimum of the excess number of molecules in the critical cluster. This conjecture leads to the form of W containing no <b>adjustable</b> parameters. The <b>barrier</b> scaling function ? = W/Wcl, where Wcl is the classical nucleation barrier, depends parametrically on temperature through the dimensionless combination of material properties.

Lett. 88, 206105 (2002) ] is applied for nucleation in hard [...] sphere liquids. The exact thermodynamics from molecular dynamics is used. The interface thickness for phase field is evaluated from the cross [...] interfacial {{variation of the}} height of the singlet density peaks. The model parameters are fixed in equilibrium so that the free energy and thickness of the (111), (110), and (100) interfaces from molecular dynamics are recovered. The density profiles predicted without adjustable parameters are in a good agreement with the filtered densities from the simulations. Assuming spherical symmetry, we evaluate {{the height of the}} nucleation barrier and the Tolman length without <b>adjustable</b> parameters. The <b>barrier</b> heights calculated with the properties of the (111) and (110) interfaces envelope the Monte Carlo results, while those obtained with the average interface properties fall very close to the exact values. In contrast, the classical sharp interface model considerably underestimates the height of the nucleation barrier. We find that the Tolman length is positive for small clusters and decreases with increasing size, a trend consistent with computer simulations. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
