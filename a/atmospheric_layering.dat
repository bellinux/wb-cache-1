(30 deg N) to determine <b>atmospheric</b> <b>layering</b> and density distributions of ions and neutrals. The program measured vertical profiles between 70 and 150 km altitude of total neutrals, ions and electrons, individual species, temperature, density, diffusion coefficients, horizontal winds, and turbulent structure.

Wind fields were measured from seven chemical trails, separated up to 60 km horizontally and 600 sec in time. Kinetic temperatures were measured from fluorescence of chemically-released AlO, ranging from 440 to 680 K between 126 and 161 km. Densities derived from diffusion of the AlO ranged from 10 to 5 times 10 to the - 12 th power per cu cm between 126 and 139 km.

40|$|We {{observed}} the occultation by Pluto of a 12 th magnitude star, {{one of the}} two brightest occultation stars ever in our dozen years of continual monitoring of Pluto's atmosphere through such studies, on 2015 June 29 UTC. At the Univ. of Canterbury Mt. John Observatory (New Zealand), under clear skies throughout, we used a POETS frame-transfer CCD at 10 Hz with GPS timing on the 1 -m McLellan telescope as well as an infrared camera on an 0. 6 -m telescope and three-color photometry at a slower cadence on a second 0. 6 -m telescope. At the Auckland Observatory, we used a POETS and a PICO on 0. 5 -m and 0. 4 -m telescopes, with 0. 4 s and 2 s cadences, respectively, obtaining ingress observations before clouds moved in. The Mt.

40|$|The {{majority}} of tropospheric ozone depletion event (ODE) studies have focussed on time-series measurements, with comparatively few {{studies of the}} vertical component. Those that exist have almost exclusively used free-flying balloon-borne ozonesondes and almost all have been conducted in the Arctic. Here we use measurements from two separate Antarctic field experiments to examine the vertical profile of ozone during Antarctic ODEs. We use tethersonde data to probe details in the lowest few hundred meters and find considerable structure in the profiles associated with complex <b>atmospheric</b> <b>layering.</b> The profiles were all measured at wind speeds less than 7 ms − 1, and on each occasion the lowest inversion height lay between 10 m and 40 m. We also use data from a free-flying ozonesonde study to select events where ozone depletion was recorded at altitudes > 1 km above ground level. Using ERA- 40 meteorological charts, we find that on every occasion the high altitude depletion was preceded by an atmospheric low pressure system. An examination of limited published ozonesonde data from other Antarctic stations shows {{this to be a}} consistent feature. Given the link between BrO and ODEs, we also examine ground-based and satellite BrO measurements and find a strong association between atmospheric low pressure systems and enhanced BrO that must arise in the troposphere. The results suggest that, in Antarctica, such depressions are responsible for driving high altitude ODEs and for generating the large-scale BrO clouds observed from satellites. In the Arctic, the prevailing meteorology differs from that in Antarctica, but, while a less common effect, major low pressure systems in the Arctic can also generate BrO clouds. Such depressions thus appear to be fundamental when considering the broader influence of ODEs, certainly in Antarctica, such as halogen export and the radiative influence of ozone-depleted air masses...|$|E

40|$|During {{transport}} by advection, atmospheric nonspherical particles, such as volcanic ash, desert dust or sea-salt particles experience several {{chemical and}} physical processes, {{leading to a}} complex vertical <b>atmospheric</b> <b>layering</b> at remote sites where intrusion episodes occur. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to analyse this complex vertical layering {{in the case of}} a two/three-component particle external mixtures. This methodology relies on an analysis of the spectral and polarization properties of the light backscattered by atmospheric particles. It is based on combining a sensitive and accurate UV-VIS polarization lidar experiment with T-matrix numerical simulations and air mass back trajectories. The Lyon UV-VIS polarization lidar is used to efficiently partition the particle mixture into its nonspherical components, while the T-matrix method is used for simulating the backscattering and depolarization properties of nonspherical volcanic ash, desert dust and sea-salt particles. It is shown that the particle mixtures' depolarization ratio δ p differs from the nonspherical particles' depolarization ratio δ ns due to the presence of spherical particles in the mixture. Hence, after identifying a tracer for nonspherical particles, particle backscattering coefficients specific to each nonspherical component can be retrieved in a two-component external mixture. For three-component mixtures, the spectral properties of light must in addition be exploited by using a dual-wavelength polarization lidar. Hence, for the first time, in a three-component external mixture, the nonsphericity of each particle is taken into account in a so-called 2 β + 2 δ formalism. Applications of this new methodology are then demonstrated in two case studies carried out in Lyon, France, related to the mixing of Eyjafjallajökull volcanic ash with sulfate particles (case of a two-component mixture) and to the mixing of dust with sea-salt and water-soluble particles (case of a three-component mixture). This new methodology, which is able to provide separate vertical profiles of backscattering coefficient for mixed atmospheric dust, sea-salt and water-soluble particles, may be useful for accurate radiative forcing assessments...|$|E
