5|$|Jump {{distance}} is measured {{from the edge}} of the table to the placement of landing by increments of 0.5m. This is done using electronic and video monitoring systems together with event personnel assigned to observe jumps by the side of the hill, known as 'distance measurers'. If enough jumps are deemed to be too far beyond the hill size, or near the 'fall line' as determined by the jury – the zone where the slope begins to flatten out – an immediate meeting is held between the jury and race director, which usually results in the start gate being lowered so as to check inrun speeds and therefore distances. For spectators and judges, increments of 5m are clearly indicated by rows of fir across the hill; a painted red line is used for the K-point, and <b>a</b> <b>dashed</b> red line for the hill size. Both sides of the hill are also marked highly visible in red to indicate the 'landing zone', while the point beyond the hill size is marked in green on the sides.|$|E

25|$|Dual carriageways of {{this class}} differ from {{motorways}} {{in a number}} of ways. The hard shoulder is demarcated with <b>a</b> <b>dashed</b> yellow line (as opposed to an unbroken yellow line on motorways). The standard speed limit of 100km/h (62mph) for national routes usually applies (by default the limit is 80km/h (50mph) for non-national roads, even if dual carriageway). Local authorities have the power to apply a limit of up to 120km/h (75mph) as used on most motorways (The High Quality Dual Carriageway section of the N1 between the end of the M1 and the border with Northern Ireland and the N25/N22 Ballincollig Bypass in Cork are the only route sections with such special limits).|$|E

5000|$|Although the Slovaks were {{demanding}} a hyphen (Czech, Slovak: spojovník), the Czechs called it <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> (Czech, Slovak: pomlčka).

2500|$|However, the Hood Canal fault {{has been}} [...] "largely inferred" [...] {{due to a}} paucity of evidence, {{including}} lack of definite scarps and any other signs of active seismicity. [...] A 2001 study using high-resolution seismic tomography questioned its existence. [...] Though a 2012 study interpreted a different variety of tomographic data as showing the Hood Canal fault, other mapping has [...] "found no convincing evidence {{for the existence of}} this fault", considers it doubtful, depicted it [...] "with low level of confidence", or omits it entirely. For these reasons this is now a questioned fault, and is indicated on the map as <b>a</b> <b>dashed</b> line.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{ways in which the}} notion of [...] "pattern" [...] has been generalized. [...] For example, a vincular pattern is a {{permutation}} containing dashes indicating the entries that need not occur consecutively (in the normal pattern definition, no entries need to occur consecutively). [...] For example, the permutation 314265 has two copies of the dashed pattern 2-31-4, given by the entries 3426 and 3425. [...] For <b>a</b> <b>dashed</b> pattern β and any permutation π, we write β(π) for the number of copies of β in π. [...] Thus the number of inversions in π is 2-1(π), while the number of descents is 21(π). [...] Going further, the number of valleys in π is 213(π) + 312(π), while the number of peaks is 231(π) + 132(π). [...] These patterns were introduced by , who showed that almost all known Mahonian statistics could be expressed in terms of vincular permutations. [...] For example, the Major index of π is equal to 1-32(π) + 2-31(π) + 3-21(π) + 21(π).|$|E
2500|$|NSText and its related {{classes are}} used to display and edit strings. The {{collection}} of objects involved permit an application to implement anything from a simple single-line text entry field to a complete multi-page, multi-column text layout schema, with full professional typography features such as kerning, ligatures, running text around arbitrary shapes, rotation, full Unicode support and anti-aliased glyph rendering. Paragraph layout can be controlled automatically or by the user, using a built-in [...] "ruler" [...] object that can be attached to any text view. Spell checking is automatic, using a single dictionary used by all applications that uses the squiggly underlining convention introduced by Microsoft (actually <b>a</b> <b>dashed</b> red underline in Cocoa). Unlimited undo-redo support is built in. Using only the built-in features, one can write a text editor application in as few as 10 lines of code. With new controller objects, this may fall to zero.

2500|$|China first {{asserted}} {{sovereignty in}} the modern sense to the South China Sea’s islands when it formally objected to France’s efforts to incorporate them into French Indochina during the Sino-French War (1884–1885). Initially, France recognized Qing China's sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly archipelagos, in exchange for Chinese recognition of Vietnam as a French territory. Chinese maps since then have consistently shown China’s claims, first as a solid and then as <b>a</b> <b>dashed</b> line. In 1932, {{one year after the}} Japanese Empire invaded northeast China, France formally claimed both the Paracel and Spratly Islands. [...] China and Japan both protested. [...] In 1933, France seized the Paracels and Spratlys, announced their annexation, formally included them in French Indochina. They built several weather stations on them, but they did not disturb the numerous Chinese fishermen found there. In 1938 Japan took the islands from France, garrisoned them, and built a submarine base at Itu Aba (now Taiping / 太平) Island. In 1941, the Japanese Empire made the Paracel and Spratly islands part of Taiwan, then under its rule.|$|E

[...] College Football News and Real Football 365 both had Texas ranked third in the pre-season. [...] The Longhorns came into the season rankedfourth in both the Coaches' Poll and AP Poll. [...] Texas started out 4–0, but with sloppy playing, edging out 4 unranked teams. Texas came particularly close to being upset when the beat unranked UCF, 38–35. Texas then suffered losses to Kansas State (41–21) and Oklahoma (28–21). Texas then surged back, winning fivegames in a row. At 9–2, they were poised to gain a BCS bowl berth. However, a 30–38 loss to Texas <b>A</b> <b>dashed</b> these hopes. The Longhorns finished the season 10–3 with {{a victory in the}} 2007 Holiday Bowl. The Longhorns were ranked tenth in the final AP poll and in the USA Today Coaches' Poll.|$|E
2500|$|Play {{is started}} at the {{beginning}} of each half by a kick-off. One side—determined following the toss of a coin—takes a drop kick from the middle of the halfway line to start the half. The ball must travel at least 10 m into the opposition half. None of the kicking team's players are allowed in front of the player taking the kick until after that player's foot has touched the ball. The kicking side frequently kicks the ball high and for it to go just over 10 m, which is marked by <b>a</b> <b>dashed</b> line across the pitch. This tactic gives their players time to chase the lobbed ball and hope to catch it before the opposition does. Alternatively the kick may be a long kick deep into opposition territory, sacrificing the chance to regain possession for territorial gain. A restart kick that does not cross the 10 m line can either be played by the receiving team, but not by the kicking team, or a midfield scrum is awarded to the receiving team. A restart kick that crosses the side lines without being touched awards the receiving team either a midfield scrum or a line out on the halfway line, receiving team option.|$|E
