50|$|The {{consequence}} was that, {{with these}} and certain statutory exceptions (e.g., actions on policies of insurance), an action on an assigned {{chose in action}} must have been brought at law {{in the name of}} the assignor, though the sum recovered belonged <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> to the assignee. All choses in action being <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> assignable, except those altogether incapable of being assigned, <b>in</b> <b>equity</b> the assignee might have sued in his own name, making the assignor a party as co-plaintiff or as defendant. The Judicature Acts made the distinction between legal and equitable choses in action of no importance. The Judicature Act of 1873, s. 25 (6), enacted that the legal right to a debt or other legal chose in action could be passed by absolute <b>assignment</b> <b>in</b> writing under the hand of the assignor. This was later updated by the Law of Property Act 1925 s136.|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates whether {{perceptions}} of the working environment are related to a Marine Corps member's intentions to remain on active duty. The study further examines whether perceptions about intra-organizational mobility, inequity in the workplace, and organizational support vary by racial/ethnic group. The analysis focuses on Hispanics, the largest growing ethnic minority in the United States and draws upon data from the 2002 Status of the Armed Forces: Gender and Working Relations (WGR) Survey. Logistic regression models are developed for junior officers and enlisted personnel to determine the relationship between {{perceptions of}} the working environment in the Marine Corps and a Marine's intention to stay on active duty or complete a 20 -year military career. The results of the quantitative analysis show that negative views about professional development, current <b>assignment,</b> and <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> the workplace are significant in both officer and enlisted models. Results also indicate that, among racial/ethnic groups, Hispanics are most strongly influenced by the effects of negative perceptions in the working environment on their plans {{to remain in the}} Marine Corps. It is recommended that further research look at the Hispanic military population by focusing on the various sub-groups within the ethnic category itself...|$|R

In this study 100 women were selected with convenient sampling and they responded to marital equity researcher-made questionnaire and Hudson marital satisfaction index (IMS). The main findings indicated that there are positive and significant correlations between equity and its components and marital satisfaction.

We prove that the greedy algorithm is Δ-competitive, where Δ is the maximum degree of G. We next employ the "classify and randomly select" paradigm to give a 5 -competitive randomized algorithm for the case of planar interference graphs. We also show how the problem of on-line frequency <b>assignment</b> <b>in</b> mobile networks with multiple available frequency channels reduces to the problem of on-line frequency <b>assignment</b> <b>in</b> mobile networks with a single channel.
