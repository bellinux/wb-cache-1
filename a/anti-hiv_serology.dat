40|$|Goltz Syndrome (Focal Dermal Hypoplasia) {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} {{mesoectodermal dysplasia}} with multisystemic involvement. It was first described by Goltz in 1962 and more than 200 cases reported worldwide (Leite et al., 2005). Skin lesions are characterized by athrophic, hyperpigmented linear or reticulated macules, multiple mucocutaneous papillomas, fat herniations or fat tumors. Besides the skin, other structures frequently involved are the skeletal system, eyes, teeth, hair, nails and central nervous system (Kanitakis et al., 2003). The association between Goltz syndrome and <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>serology</b> was {{not found in the}} literature. We report 32 year-old woman with typical cutaneous leisons of Goltz Syndrome associated with false positive <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>serology</b> and secondary infertility...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the prevalence of syphilis among blood donors in the Xi’an region of China. All blood donors were unremunerated volunteers recruited from 2006 to 2010. Anti-Treponema pallidum and <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>serology</b> responses were determined using ELISA kits. Among 159   902 voluntary blood donors tested, a total of 575 syphilis (0. 36 %) and 55 HIV (0. 03 %) infections were identified. While an increasing trend was shown for the prevalence of both syphilis and HIV over the 5 -year period, there was no statistical correlation between the two infections. Our results indicate that syphilis and HIV infections are increasing risk factors for the spread of blood-borne infections. Further investigations and improvements in blood collection and testing procedures are needed to help ensure the safety of donated blood in China...|$|E
40|$|A {{regional}} external {{quality assessment}} scheme (REQAS) for <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>serology</b> aimed to objectively assess reliability {{and quality of}} HIV testing processes in the African region. This involved the distribution of proficiency testing (PT) panels to participating laboratories from 2002 to 2010. During the survey period, this included 16 distributions of PT panels to 49 laboratories in 30 countries, and the overall average score during the nine-year survey period was 98. 9 %, with a frequency of accurate detection, of anti-HIV- 1 and/or anti-HIV- 2 antibodies in the PT panels, ranging from 93 % to 100 %. Problems highlighted included lack of human resources and frequent stock outs of test kits, reagents and consumables for routine HIV testing. The design of the REQAS allowed appraisal of the reliability of anti-HIV serological testing methods utilised by laboratories for clinical assessment of patients and/or surveillance programmes. The REQAS was able to demonstrate that laboratories participating in the REQAS performed well and sustained {{their participation in the}} scheme. This bodes well for clinical diagnosis, surveillance and training activities at these reference laboratories. <br /...|$|E
40|$|HIV {{infection}} {{is an important}} risk factor {{for the development of}} tuberculosis (TB), and also affects its morbidity and mortality. This study estimated the prevalence of HIV infection in patients hospitalized for TB in Bahia (in northeastern Brazil) and to evaluate its impact on in-hospital mortality. A total of 375 patients with TB, admitted consecutively to a TB reference hospital in Salvador (Bahia, Brazil), were evaluated between July 2001 and July 2003. <b>Anti-HIV</b> <b>serology</b> was performed in all patients irrespective of clinical and/or epidemiological data suggestive of HIV infection. Death during hospitalization was the principal event-dependent variable. Mean age of patients was 41. 4 ± 16. 2 years and the male/female ratio was 3. 4 : 1. 0. The prevalence of HIV infection was 8. 8 % (95 %CI: 6. 2 - 12. 0 %). Patients in the HIV-positive group were younger than those in the HIV-negative group (37. 1 versus 41. 9 years; p= 0. 05). In-hospital mortality was 10. 9 % for the whole group (95 %CI: 9. 4 - 15. 9 %), but was significantly greater in the HIV-positive group compared to the HIV-negative group (27. 3 % versus 9. 4 %; RR= 2. 9; 95 %CI: 1. 5 - 5. 6; p= 0. 002). The prevalence of HIV infection in patients hospitalized for TB in Bahia (northeastern Brazil) is relatively high (8. 8 %) and mortality is significantly higher (2. 9 -fold) in the HIV-positive group. These findings justify carrying out HIV testing, as recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, in all TB patients, particularly those requiring hospitalization...|$|E
40|$|Apesar de predominar junto à população a idéia de que a violência sexual é praticada por pessoas desconhecidas, na realidade a maioria desses crimes é praticada por pessoa identificável pela vítima. Além de conseqüências físicas e psicológicas, também há risco em adquirir o vírus HIV. Para prevenção deste, em situação de risco, há orientação para uso da quimioprofilaxia anti-retroviral. Esse uso, por 28 dias, pode trazer efeitos adversos com intensidades variáveis. O conhecimento da sorologia anti-HIV do agressor torna-se {{fundamental}} para manter, ou suspender, com segurança, essa indicação. Este estudo descritivo, realizado no Conjunto Hospitalar de Sorocaba, teve como objetivo identificar os agressores e suas respectivas sorologias. Foi realizado a partir de fichas de notificação e os prontuários no período de julho de 2003 a dezembro de 2005. Encontraram-se 920 vítimas de violência sexual, com idades entre oito meses e 77 anos, havendo predomínio do sexo feminino (86, 5 %). Dentre os agressores, 76 % foram referidos como identificáveis. Indicou-se profilaxia anti-retroviral para 24, 9 % das vítimas. Para 80 (33, 2 %) agressores localizados, a busca foi realizada através de contato telefônico. Encontrou-se 52, 5 % em seus domicílios, 45 % em Presídio/Delegacia e 2, 5 % no Pronto Socorro. Um agressor (1, 3 %) apresentou sorologia positiva para HIV. As buscas encerraram-se, em sua maioria, em até seis dias (80 %), possibilitando a suspensão da quimioprofilaxia em 30, 6 % dos casos. Concluiu-se que a busca ao denunciado permitiu conhecer sua sorologia anti-HIV e suspender, para um terço das vítimas, o uso da quimioprofilaxia anti-retroviral, diminuindo, com isso, a possibilidade de efeitos adversos. Although {{people believe}} that sexual violence is practiced by unknown people, most crimes are actually practiced by someone close to the victim. Besides physical and psychological consequences, there is the risk of acquiring the HIV virus. To prevent the latter, in risky situations, the advice is to use antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis during 28 days. This therapy may bring adverse effects. Knowing the aggressor's <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>serology</b> is vital to safely maintain or suspend the therapy indication. This descriptive study, carried out at Conjunto Hospitalar de Sorocaba, aimed to identify the aggressors and their serology. The study was conducted after analyzing notification index cards and charts from July 2003 to December 2005, in 30 months of active search. The researchers found 920 sexual violence victims, with ages ranging from 8 months to 77 years, most of them female (86. 5 %). Concerning the aggressors, 76 % were referred to as identifiable. Antiretroviral prophylaxis was advised to 24. 9 % of the victims. For 80 (33. 2 %) aggressors who were found, the search was carried out through telephone calls. Regarding {{the places where the}} aggressors were located, 52. 5 % were found at home, 45 % in a prison/police station and 2. 5 % in the Emergency Room. One aggressor (1. 3 %) presented positive HIV serology. Most searches were concluded within 6 days (80 %), allowing the suspension of chemoprophylaxis in 30. 6 % of the cases. It was concluded that after finding the aggressors and learning about their <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>serology,</b> the use of antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis could be safely suspended in one third of the victims, therefore reducing the chances of adverse effects...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} radiological manifestations of chest tuberculosis among the tuberculosis outpatients at the Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São Paulo Hospital, and to correlate these radiological findings with the sputum bacilloscopy. SAMPLE AND METHODS: A review {{was made of the}} medical record cards and chest X-rays of all patients attended between January 1996 and December 1998. Patients with a diagnosis of tuberculosis who presented intrathoracic manifestations of the disease and negative <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>serology</b> were selected. RESULTS: The selection included 153 patients, with an average age of 37. 5 years, who were predominantly male (60. 8 %) and white (56. 9 %). Pulmonary lesions were present in 121 (79. 9 %) and extrapulmonary lesions in 32 (20. 1 %). Parenchymal-infiltrate lesions appeared in 56 patients (36. 6 %), cavity lesions in 55 (36. 0 %), pleural effusion in 28 (18. 3 %), isolated nodules in 6 (3. 9 %), mediastinal enlargement in 4 (2. 6 %) and miliary pattern in 4 (2. 6 %). Cavities were present in 45. 5 % of the patients with pulmonary lesions, generally in association with the parenchymal-infiltrate lesions. Parenchymal infiltrate was present in 86. 8 % of the patients with pulmonary lesions. There was significant presence of alcohol-acid resistant bacillus in the sputum of patients with cavities (76. 4 %), in comparison with those without cavities (50 %) (p = 0. 003). CONCLUSIONS: Parenchymal-infiltrate lesions are the most frequent radiological manifestation of pulmonary tuberculosis, and they are generally associated with cavities. There is a relationship between the presence of acid fast bacilli in sputum and pulmonary cavity lesions...|$|E

40|$|As infecÃÃes por micobactÃrias nÃo tuberculosas (MNT) estÃo se tornando mais frequentes em todo o mundo, {{inclusive}} no Brasil. A capacidade das MNT em produzir doenÃa estÃ claramente documentada na literatura e sua importÃncia clÃnica vem aumentando progressivamente. Embora a micobactÃria possa comprometer qualquer ÃrgÃo ou sÃtio, a forma mais frequente de comprometimento Ã a doenÃa pulmonar. Esse estudo se propÃs a avaliar aspectos clÃnicos e epidemiolÃgicos de pacientes com doenÃa pulmonar por MNT e a diversidade das espÃcies isoladas. Foram estudados retrospectivamente, 59 pacientes inscritos para tratamento no ambulatÃrio de referÃncia do Hospital de Messejana, perÃodo de 1998 a 2008. As espÃcies de MNT isoladas em meio de cultura a partir de amostras de escarro foram identificadas atravÃs da metodologia PRA no LaboratÃrio de Microbiologia da Faculdade de Medicina, UFC e classificadas conforme a patogenicidade em potencialmente ou raramente patogÃnicas. As variÃveis foram: ano diagnÃstico, idade, procedÃncia, sexo, profissÃo e risco biolÃgico de adoecimento, grau de escolaridade, renda familiar, comorbidades, histÃria prÃvia de tuberculose (TB), sorologia HIV, teste tuberculÃnico, histÃria de tabagismo e etilismo, sintomas clÃnicos, achados radiolÃgicos e desfecho. As variÃveis categÃricas e quantitativas foram analisadas atravÃs de proporÃÃes e frequÃncias com cÃlculo das medidas de localizaÃÃo central e de dispersÃo para cada variÃvel isoladamente. As anÃlises de associaÃÃes foram feitas utilizando o teste nÃo-paramÃtrico de Pearson e o teste paramÃtrico da razÃo de verossimilhanÃas, com IC= 95 % e p = 0, 05. Resultados: As espÃcies identificadas mais frequentes foram: M. abscessus, 28, 5 % (17 / 59); M. lentiflavum 18, 6 % (11 / 59); M. avium, 16, 6 % (10 / 59). A mÃdia de idade Â dp do grupo foi de 50, 4 Â 16, 1 anos; 62, 7 % (37 / 59) do sexo masculino e 62, 7 % tinham no mÃximo o ensino fundamental; 72, 9 % (43 / 59) renda atÃ um salÃrio mÃnimo; 49, 2 % (29 / 59) uso de Ãlcool e 40, 6 % (24 / 59) tabagismo; 62, 7 % (37 / 59) profissÃo com risco biolÃgico; 86 % (51 / 59) residiam em Fortaleza; A tosse foi observada em 91, 5 % (54 / 59) e expectoraÃÃo em 72, 9 % (43 / 59); Fibrose e cavidade foram observadas em 71, 2 % (42 / 59) e 45, 8 (27 / 59), respectivamente. Sorologia HIV foi positiva em 7 % (4 / 59); teste tuberculÃnico realizado em 22 % (13 / 59), desses, 92, 3 % (12 / 13) positivos; 54 % (32 / 59) tiveram alta por cura e 15, 3 % (9 / 59) Ãbito. As associaÃÃes entre profissÃo com risco biolÃgico e sexo feminino, profissÃo com risco biolÃgico e comorbidade, e profissÃo e renda familiar mostraram-se significantes. A anÃlise de associaÃÃo da patogenicidade da espÃcie de MNT isolada com as outras variÃveis do estudo nÃo mostrou significÃncia, ou seja, nenhuma foi discriminativa. Este estudo demonstra a importÃncia para o reconhecimento da doenÃa pulmonar por MNT, cujas espÃcies podem ser identificadas em amostras de escarro. Infections {{caused by}} nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) {{are becoming more}} frequent {{around the world and}} also in Brazil. The ability of produce disease is clearly documented in the literature and its importance has been increasing steadily. Although mycobacteria can affect any human organ, {{the most common form of}} involvement is the lung disease. This study aimed to evaluate clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients with NTM lung disease and the diversity of species isolated. We studied retrospectively 59 patients enrolled for treatment at the outpatient clinic reference Messejana Hospital, from 1998 to 2008. The species of NTM isolated from sputum were identified using PRA method in the Microbiology Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of CearÃ. The variables studied were: year of diagnosis, age, origin, gender, profession and biological risk of illness, education level, family income, clinical symptoms, comorbidity, previous history of tuberculosis (TB), radiological findings, <b>anti-HIV</b> <b>serology,</b> tuberculin test, history of smoking and alcoholism and outcome. The quantitative and categorical variables were analysed by calculating frequencies and proportions of the measures of central location and dispersion for each variable separately. The analyzes of associations were performed using the nonparametric Pearsonâs test and parametric test of the likelihood ratio (based on product binomial distributions / multinomial) using CI = 95 % and p < 0, 05. The PRA method identified all 59 species, with predominance of the following: M. abscessus, 28. 5 % (17 / 59); M. lentiflavum 18. 6 % (11 / 59); M. avium, 16. 6 % (10 / 59); M. fortuitum and M. smegmatis, 10. 2 % (06 / 59) each; M. kansasii, 6. 8 % (4 / 59). The mean age Â SD of the group was 50. 4 Â 16. 1 years; 62. 7 % (37 / 59) were male and 62, 7 % had at most basic education, 72. 9 % (43 / 59) with income below the poverty level, 49. 2 % (29 / 59) reported using alcohol and 40. 6 % (24 / 59) smoking, 59. 3 % (35 / 59) were involved with biological risk, 86 % (51 %) lived in Fortaleza. Cough was observed in 91. 5 % (54 / 59) and expectoration in 72. 9 % (43 / 59). Fibrosis and cavity were in 71. 2 % (42 / 59) and 45. 8 % (27 / 59) of the patients, respectively. HIV serology was positive in 7 % (4 / 59), tuberculin skin test was performed in only 22 % (13 / 59), of which 92. 3 % (12 / 13) were positive, 54 % (32 / 59) had cured and 15. 3 % (9 / 59) had died. The associations between the variable profession with biological risk and gender (60 % female), and between profession with biological risk and comorbidity (75 % had associated disease), and profession with biological risk and family income proved to be significant. The association analysis of the groups of species of NTM isolated, if potentially pathogenic or rarely pathogenic with the others different study variables were not significant, thus did not discriminate to differentiate the groups. This study demonstrated the importance for the recognition of NTM lung disease whose species can be identified in sputum samples and for the epidemiological importance and the need for differential diagnosis in cases of tuberculosis...|$|E
