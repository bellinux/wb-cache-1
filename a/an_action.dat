5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy VI is menu-based, {{in which}} the player selects <b>an</b> <b>action</b> {{from a list of}} such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four {{characters}} may be used in battles, which are based on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, each character has <b>an</b> <b>action</b> bar that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on their speed statistic. When a character's action bar is filled, the player may assign <b>an</b> <b>action.</b> In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes' Runic ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} between {{left and right}} actions is in {{the order in which}} a product like gh acts on x. For <b>a</b> left <b>action</b> h acts first and is followed by g, while for <b>a</b> right <b>action</b> g acts first and is followed by h. Because of the formula , one can construct <b>a</b> left <b>action</b> from <b>a</b> right <b>action</b> by composing with the inverse operation of the group. Also, <b>a</b> right <b>action</b> of <b>a</b> group G on X is the same thing as <b>a</b> left <b>action</b> of its opposite group Gop on X. It is thus sufficient to only consider left actions without any loss of generality.|$|R

5|$|Utilitarianism {{is a type}} of consequentialist ethical theory. According to such theories, {{only the}} outcome of <b>an</b> <b>action</b> is morally {{relevant}} (this contrasts with deontology, according to which moral actions flow from duties or motives). Utilitarianism is a combination of consequentialism and the philosophical position hedonism, which states that pleasure, or happiness, is the only good worth pursuing. Therefore, since only the consequences of <b>an</b> <b>action</b> matter, and only happiness matters, only happiness that is the consequence of <b>an</b> <b>action</b> is morally relevant. There are similarities with preference utilitarianism, where utility is defined as individual preference rather than pleasure.|$|E

5|$|Axons {{transmit}} {{signals to}} other neurons {{by means of}} specialized junctions called synapses. A single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells. When <b>an</b> <b>action</b> potential, traveling along an axon, arrives at a synapse, it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released. The neurotransmitter binds to receptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell.|$|E

5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate <b>an</b> <b>action</b> potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. <b>An</b> <b>action</b> potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When <b>an</b> <b>action</b> potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
