40|$|Introduction In {{the last}} years the Global Positioning System has become a {{worthwhile}} tool supporting wide range of fields in the Earth Sciences. One of its recent applications to study the sea is the using of GPS buoys for the calibration of satellite altimeters {{as well as for}} the validation of the geophysical data records (GDR) derived from the altimeter measurements. In this work an application of these buoys to the calibration of space altimeter sensors on board will be presented. An example of <b>absolute</b> <b>altimeter</b> calibration performed in the North Western Mediterranean Sea applied to the NASA/CNES TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite is going to be shown. This example fits in the framework of several <b>absolute</b> <b>altimeter</b> calibration campaigns, the CATALA campaigns (Absolute Calibration of the TOPEX Altimeter in the Catalonia Sea), developed under the sponsor of the Comisi 6 n Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnolog(a, CICYT, National Coordinated R+D project in Space Research (ref.

40|$|The Earth's modem {{climate change}} has been {{characterized}} by interlinked changes in temperature, CO 2, ice sheets and sea level. Global sea level change is a critical indicator for study of contemporary climate change. Sea level rise appears to have accelerated since the ice sheet retreats have stopped some 5000 years ago and {{it is estimated that}} the sea level rise has been approx. 15 cm over the last century. Contemporary radar altimeters represent the only technique capable of monitoring global sea level change with accuracy approaching 1 mm/yr and with a temporal scale of days and a spatial scale of 100 km or longer. This report highlights the major accomplishments of the TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) Extended Mission and Jason- 1 science investigation. The primary objectives of the investigation include the calibration and improvement of T/P and Jason- 1 altimeter data for global sea level change and coastal tide and circulation studies. The scientific objectives of the investigation include: (1) the calibration and improvement of T/P and Jason- 1 data as a reference measurement system for the accurate cross-linking with other altimeter systems (Seasat, Geosat, ERS- 1, ERS- 2, GFO- 1, and Envisat), (2) the improved determination and the associated uncertainties of the long-term (15 -year) global mean sea level change using multiple altimeters, (3) the characterization of the sea level change by analyses of independent data, including tide gauges, sea surface temperature, and (4) the improvement coastal radar altimetry for studies including coastal ocean tide modeling and coastal circulation. Major accomplishments of the investigation include the development of techniques for low-cost radar <b>altimeter</b> <b>absolute</b> calibration (including the associated GPS-buoy technology), coastal ocean tide modeling, and the linking of multiple altimeter systems and the resulting determination of the 15 -year (1985 - 1999) global mean sea level variations. The current rate of 15 -year sea level rise observed by multiple satellite altimetry is + 2. 3 +/- 1. 2 mm/yr, which is in general agreement with the analysis of sparsely distributed tide gauge measurements for the same data span, and represents the first such determination of sea level change in its kind...|$|R
40|$|The three Begur {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} on March, 16 - 19, 1999, {{which was the first}} altime-ter calibration ever developed in Spain and the first Alt-B altimeter calibration made in the Mediterranean Sea; on July, 4 - 7, 2000, and on August, 25 - 28, 2002. Direct <b>absolute</b> <b>altimeter</b> calibration, estimating the TOPEX Alt-B bias, was made from direct over-flights using GPS buoys. This method does not require any modelling of geoid and tidal error. Other main objective of the campaigns was to map with GPS buoys the Mean Sea Surface, MSS, along an ascending T/P groundtrack about 15 - 20 km from the coast, using coastal tide gauge measurements. This method requires geographical mapping of geoid and ocean tides which reduces the accuracy of the bias estimate by a factor of two. Indirect <b>absolute</b> <b>altimeter</b> calibration is possible for any satellite crossing the MSS, with the only requirement that tide gauges are operational during the overflight. In the framework of the JASON- 1 CNES/NASA mission, a campaign was conducted on June 9 - 17, 2003, in the Absolute Calibration Site of the Island of Ibiza. The objective was to determine the local marine geoid slope under the ascending (187) and descending (248) Jason- 1 ground tracks, in order to allow a better extrapolation of the open-ocean altimetric data with on-shore tide gauge locations, an...|$|E

The general design characteristics for <b>absolute</b> <b>altimeter</b> calibration imply a large number of measurements to reduce the random errors, diversity of measurement techniques and independent data analysis, to reduce the susceptibility to systematic errors. Part of the altimeter calibration can be undertaken by comparison against in situ tide gauge data and GPS buoys, by inter-comparison between two altimeter data sets from concurrent satellites, or a...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of calibration/validation (C/V) of Envisat satellite radar altimeter over Lake Issykkul located in Kyrgyzstan, which was chosen as a dedicated radar altimetry C/V site in 2004. The objectives are to estimate the <b>absolute</b> <b>altimeter</b> bias of Envisat and its orbit based on cross-over analysis with TOPEX/Poseidon (TIP), Jason- 1 and Jason- 2 over the ocean. We have used a new method of GPS data processing in a kinematic mode, developed at the Groupe de Recherche de Geodesie Spatiale (GRGS), which allows us to calculate the position of the GPS antenna without needing a GPS reference station. The C/V is conducted using various equipments: a local GPS network, a moving GPS antenna along the satellites tracks over Lake Issykkul, In Situ level gauges and weather stations. The absolute bias obtained for Envisat from field campaigns conducted in 2009 and 2010 is between 62. 1 and 63. 4 +/- 3. 7 cm, using the Ice- 1 retracking algorithm, and between 46. 9 and 51. 2 cm with the ocean retracking algorithm. These results differ by about 10 cm from previous studies, principally due to improvement of the C/V procedure. Apart from the new algorithm for GPS data processing and the orbit error reduction, more {{attention has been paid to}} the GPS antenna height calculation, and we have reduced the errors induced by seiche over Lake Issykkul. This has been assured using cruise data along the Envisat satellite track at the exact date of the pass of the satellite for the two campaigns. The calculation of the Envisat radar altimeter bias with respect to the GPS levelling is essential to allow the continuity of multi-mission data on the same orbit, with the expected launch of SARAL/Altika mission in 2012. Implications for hydrology in particular, will be to produce long term homogeneous and reliable time series of lake levels worldwide...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{results of}} calibration/validation (C/V) of Jason- 1 and Jason- 2 satellite altimeters over Lake Issykkul located in Kyrgyzstan, which {{was chosen as}} a dedicated radar altimetry C/V site in 2004. The objectives here are to estimate <b>absolute</b> <b>altimeter</b> biases and to quantify the altimetry instrument error budgets for lakes studies, including errors associated with the atmosphere media delay corrections of the radar signal, and with the different retracking mode used over "nonocean" surface. The C/V is conducted using various equipments, for example, GPS local network, moving GPS along the satellites tracks over the Lake Issykkul, in situ level gauges and weather stations. The absolute bias obtained for Jason- 1 and Jason- 2 from field campaigns conducted in 2008, 2009 and 2010 are 96 +/- 40 mm and 162 +/- 42 mm, respectively. The bias calculated for Jason- 1 is {{in close agreement with}} estimates done at other dedicated C/V sites in the ocean, but the Jason- 2 bias still differs by 1 - 2 cm with ocean C/V estimates. The relative bias (Jason- 2 minus Jason- 1) deduced from measurements during the tandem mission is estimated at 81 +/- 10 mm. The accuracy of Jason- 1 and Jason- 2 for the determination of the lake level variations as compared to the historical in situ gauges of the Lake Issykkul is 33 and 31 mm RMS, respectively. The bias between the two modes of retracking available on Jason- 2 Geophysical Data Records (GDRs) has been estimated over the two first years of Jason- 2 data over the Lake Issykkul. We found an average value of 234 +/- 40 mm, which is in good agreement with results obtained in a previous study on the Envisat satellite (Cretaux et al. 2009). Lake level studies using Jason- 2 or Envisat must therefore take this relative bias into account if both retracked altimetry heights are used...|$|E
