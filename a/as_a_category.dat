5|$|Over the {{following}} five days, the hurricane tracked through the Greater Antilles, making five landfalls, four <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 3 hurricane and one <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Category</b> 1. Shortly after entering the Caribbean, the Georges weakened slightly; however, shortly before crossing Puerto Rico, the storm re-attained major hurricane status. After weakening slightly once more, the storm rapidly organized near the Dominican Republic. A well-defined eye formed and outflow re-established, allowing the storm to reach an intensity of 120mph (195km/h) just prior to landfall. During its passage of Hispaniola the circulation was severely disrupted, but Georges maintained hurricane-intensity. On September23, the storm made landfall in southeastern Cuba as a minimal hurricane.|$|E

They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.|$|E
