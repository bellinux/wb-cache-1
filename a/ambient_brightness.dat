The residual bubble of hot gas reaches a maximum size with an internal pressure below ambient, and then shrinks to smaller volume and a pressure nearly equal to <b>ambient.</b> The X-ray <b>brightness</b> reaches its minimum at the time of maximum radius and rises thereafter. It is found that the bubble growth must have been confined by a probably unacceptably large external pressure in order for the hot gas in the maximally extended cavity to radiate at a rate like that observed in the soft X-ray background...|$|R

40|$|The main role of head-up {{displays}} (HUDs) is {{to provide}} key flight, navigation, guidance, aircraft, weapon and target information to the pilot in his forward field of view on a see through screen known as beam combiner (BC). Hypothetically, it allows for optimal control of the aircraft events through the concurrent scanning of HUD symbology and the outside world scene. While the HUD {{has been shown to}} improve flight performance and efficiency of the pilot, there are perceptual and cognitive issues associated with its usage. It is found that in case of HUD usage the pilot’s attention in an aircraft is driven by display salience, his/her mission and his/her expertise. The physical properties of the display like color, salience, brightness, orientation, size, and clutter; pilot’s mission and expertise; and task requirements determine the level and division of attention and tunneling between the aircraft and the outside events. Based on the study results, it has been established that the HUD display brightness {{plays a key role in}} affecting pilot’s event detection capability. While the brightness of the HUD display can make the features embedded in the symbology significant, it can also force the pilot’s attention to be focused on the aircraft or the outside event depending on the level of the <b>ambient</b> <b>brightness,</b> HUD display brightness and the contrast ratio. The experimentation conducted under varying <b>ambient</b> <b>brightness</b> conditions resulted in varying responses from the participants depending on the <b>ambient</b> <b>brightness,</b> HUD display brightness and the display contrast ratio. The results showed the effect of these parameters on the capability of pilot to detect unintentional attention fixation to the display and to detect changes in aircraft events shown on HUD, or the outside environment. The behaviour of the participants was thus studied to simulate the likely behaviour of pilot under such conditions. The results were translated into a neuro-fuzzy based system such that the HUD display brightness could be dynamically altered to maintain adequate contrast ratio to minimize the tunneling effect due to the HUD brightness and resulting salience factors, thus also optimizing the attention between the aircraft (HUD symbology) and the outside event...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} an on-road driver monitoring system, which is implemented on a stand-alone in-vehicle embedded system and driven by effective solar cells. The driver monitoring function is performed by an efficient eye detection technique. Through the driver’s eye movements captured from the camera, the attention {{states of the}} driver can be determined and any fatigue states can be avoided. This driver monitoring technique is implemented on a low-power embedded in-vehicle platform. Besides, this study also proposed monitoring machinery that can detect the brightness around the car to effectively determine whether this in-vehicle system {{is driven by the}} solar cells or by the vehicle battery. On sunny days, the in-vehicle system can be powered by solar cell in places without the vehicle battery. While in the evenings or on rainy days, the <b>ambient</b> solar <b>brightness</b> is insufficient, and the system is powered by the vehicle battery. The proposed system was tested under the conditions that the solar irradiance is 10 to 113 [*]W/m 2 and solar energy and brightness at 10 to 170. From the testing results, when the outside solar radiation is high, the brightness of the inside of the car is increased, and the eye detection accuracy can also increase as well. Therefore, this solar powered driver monitoring system can be efficiently applied to electric cars to save energy consumption and promote the driving safety...|$|R

Monitor and graphics cards used by radiologists on their reporting workstations must have regular quality assessment and must be fit {{for the purpose of}} diagnostic display. In order to preserve maximum image quality specific attention should be given to room lighting. Adequate ambient light preventing glare and potential interference with the optimal image quality of diagnostic monitors should be used, preferably with an intensity approximating the monitor <b>brightness.</b> <b>Ambient</b> lighting conditions become even more important with 5 -megapixel monitors, which are accepted as a standard for mammography readings and in general have a lower brightness [19]. Teleradiologists should ensure that they have control over the ambient light in the reporting room [20, 21]. LCD displays in a three-monitor configuration are most acceptable. The brightness of the monitor is as important as image resolution, and DICOM grey-scale calibration should be used to decrease the need to perform windowing/levelling [22].|$|R
