5|$|Hinduism is {{the major}} {{religion}} with about 80% of the population adhering to it. About 11% of the population follow Islam and 8% follow Christianity. Evidence of prehistoric religion in South India comes from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings depicting dances and rituals in Stone Age sites such as the Kupgal petroglyphs of eastern Karnataka. Hinduism, often regarded as the oldest religion in the world, traces its roots to prehistoric times in India. The main spiritual traditions of South India include both Shaivite and Vaishnavite branches of Hinduism, although Buddhist and Jain philosophies had been influential several centuries earlier. Ayyavazhi is spread significantly across the southern parts of South India. Islam was introduced to South India in the early 7th century by Arab traders in Malabar Coast of Kerala and spread during the rule of Deccan Sultanates from 17th to 18th century and the Muslims in Kerala of Arab descent are called Jonaka Mappila. Christianity was introduced to South India by Thomas the Apostle, who visited Muziris in Kerala in 52 CE and baptised Kerala's Jewish settlements. Kerala {{is also home to}} one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world who <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> arrived in the Malabar coast during the reign of King Solomon.|$|E

25|$|Consider a {{heat engine}} working between two {{temperatures}} TH and Ta. With Ta we have ambient temperature in mind, but, in principle {{it may also}} be some other low temperature. The heat engine is in thermal contact with two heat reservoirs which <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a very large heat capacity so that their temperatures do not change significantly if heat QH is removed from the hot reservoir and Qa is added to the lower reservoir. Under normal operation TH > Ta and QH, Qa, and W are all positive.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{original}} written {{records from}} the Fair Play Men or their Declaration of Independence, although many later accounts exist. The two main theories that have been advanced to explain this are: first that any records were destroyed in the Great Runaway (only one house survived in the whole West Branch valley); or second that they kept no records to avoid incriminating themselves as they were illegal settlers. The riders to Philadelphia <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lost their copy of the Declaration of Independence when ambushed or later when jailed.|$|E
25|$|The Turkish Air Force retired {{all of its}} Fw 190A-3 fleet {{at the end of}} 1947 {{mostly because}} of lack of spare parts. It is rumored that American-Turkish {{bilateral}} agreements required retiring and scrapping of all German origin aircraft although this requirement did not exist for any other country. According to Hürriyet Daily News all of retired Fw 190s were saved from scrapping by wrapping them with protective cloths and burying them in the soil near the Aviation Supply and Maintenance Center at Kayseri city. Several attempts <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been made to find and move these aircraft to museums, none of them have been successful, which indicates the story is probably a hoax.|$|E

The breed, also known as Cunninghame or Ayrshire cattle are pied, white and brown, short in leg, long in the horn, straight in the back: the bulls are fiery in temper and the cows are peculiarly placid and docile. They produce milk which is very high in butterfat and ideal for cheese-making. The milk has a high protein content but is relatively homogenous.|$|E
25|$|According to legend, {{the castle}} of Dunakin (today known as Caisteal Maol), near Kyleakin, {{was built by}} a Norwegian princess known as Saucy Mary, who married Findanus the claimed {{ancestor}} of Clan Mackinnon. The princess was to have collected the tolls of ships sailing through the narrows between the castle and the mainland, though Norse ships were exempt from her toll. To ensure that her taxes were paid a chain was stretched across the kyle. On her death she was buried beneath a cairn on Beinn na Caillich (the mountain of the old woman).

25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written to ask a series of questions about this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? Why is there only one bike car on trains that <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> two bike cars? The simplest answer to most of these questions is that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, we have to be mindful of the impact of these changes on our entire system and all of our customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of our cars, not just our bike cars, serve our entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its daily maintenance and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire service schedule – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|E
