5|$|A phase <b>accumulator</b> (PA), {{which adds}} to the value held at its output a {{frequency}} control value at each clock sample.|$|E
5|$|When clocked, {{the phase}} <b>accumulator</b> (PA) creates a modulo-2N {{sawtooth}} waveform {{which is then}} converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) to a sampled sinusoid, where N {{is the number of}} bits carried in the phase <b>accumulator.</b> N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally much larger than the number of bits defining the memory space of the PAC look-up table. If the PAC capacity is 2M, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as shown in Figure 1. However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word does not affect the frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic phase error which is a primary source of spurious products. Another spurious product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of the PAC output (amplitude) word.|$|E
5|$|A phase-to-amplitude {{converter}} (PAC), {{which uses}} the phase <b>accumulator</b> output word (phase word) usually as an index into a waveform look-up table (LUT) {{to provide a}} corresponding amplitude sample. Sometimes interpolation is used with the look-up table to provide better accuracy and reduce phase error noise. Other methods of converting phase to amplitude, including mathematical algorithms such as power series can be used, particularly in a software NCO.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the years}} the FDA interviewed physicians, Reich's {{students}} and his patients, asking about the orgone accumulators. A professor at the University of Oregon who bought an <b>accumulator</b> told an FDA inspector that he knew the device was phoney, but found it helpful because his wife sat quietly in it for four hours every day.|$|E
5|$|Each 32-bit word of RAM could contain {{either a}} program {{instruction}} or data. In a program instruction, bits 0–12 represented the memory {{address of the}} operand to be used, and bits 13–15 specified the operation to be executed, such as storing a number in memory; the remaining 16bits were unused. The SSEM's single operand architecture meant that the second operand of any operation was implicit: the <b>accumulator</b> or the program counter (instruction address); program instructions specified only {{the address of the}} data in memory.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{lost his}} {{position}} at the New School in May 1941 after writing to its director, Alvin Johnson, to say he had saved several lives in secret experiments with the <b>accumulator.</b> Johnson was aware of Reich's claims that he could cure cancer, and told him the New School was not an appropriate institution for the work. Reich was also evicted from Kessel Street after his neighbours complained about the animal experiments. His supporters, including Walter Briehl, gave him $14,000 to buy a house, and he settled into 9906 69th Avenue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} was {{powered by}} pressurised water stored in several hydraulic <b>accumulators.</b> Water, at a pressure of , was {{pumped into the}} <b>accumulators</b> by two [...] stationary steam engines, each driving a force pump from its piston tail rod. The <b>accumulators</b> each comprise a 20 in ram on which sits a very heavy weight to maintain the desired pressure.|$|R

5|$|The machine's most {{significant}} innovation {{is generally considered}} to be its incorporation of index registers, commonplace on modern computers. The SSEM had included two registers, implemented as Williams tubes: the <b>accumulator</b> (A) and the program counter (C). As A and C had already been assigned, the tube holding the two index registers, originally known as B-lines, was given the name B. The contents of the registers could be used to modify program instructions, allowing convenient iteration through an array of numbers stored in memory. The Mark 1 also had a fourth tube, (M), to hold the multiplicand and multiplier for a multiplication operation.|$|E
5|$|While Reich was in Arizona in May 1956, {{one of his}} {{associates}} sent an <b>accumulator</b> part through the mail to another state, {{in violation of the}} injunction, after an FDA inspector posing as a customer requested it. Reich and another associate, Dr. Michael Silvert, were charged with contempt of court; Silvert had been looking after the inventory in Reich's absence. Reich at first refused to attend court, and was arrested and held for two days until a supporter posted bail of $30,000.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{responded with}} a 25-page letter in which he tried to change Einstein's mind. To rule out the {{influence}} of convection he told Einstein {{that he had taken}} certain measures, including introducing a horizontal plate above the <b>accumulator,</b> wrapping it in a blanket, hanging it from the ceiling, burying it underground and placing it outside. He wrote that in all these circumstances the temperature difference remained, and was in fact more marked in the open air. Einstein did not respond to this or to Reich's future correspondence– Reich would write regularly reporting the results of his experiments– until Reich threatened three years later to publish their previous exchange. Einstein replied that he could not devote any further time to the matter and asked that his name not be misused for advertising purposes. Reich believed that Einstein's change of heart was part of a conspiracy of some kind, perhaps related to the communists or prompted by the rumours that Reich was ill. Reich published the correspondence in 1953 as The Einstein Affair.|$|E

25|$|Two 8-bit accumulators: 'E' and 'F'. These can be {{concatenated}} to form 16-bit <b>accumulator</b> 'W'. The existing 6809 16-bit <b>accumulator</b> D can be concatenated with W to form 32-bit <b>accumulator</b> 'Q'.

25|$|It was {{possible}} to wire the carry of one <b>accumulator</b> into another <b>accumulator</b> to perform double precision arithmetic, but the <b>accumulator</b> carry circuit timing prevented the wiring of 3+ for even higher precision. ENIAC used 4 of the accumulators (controlled by a special multiplier unit) to perform up to 385 multiplication operations/second; 5 of the accumulators were controlled by a special divider/square-rooter unit to perform up to 40 division operations/second or 3 square root operations/second.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{improvements}} {{were made to}} ENIAC after 1948, including a primitive read-only stored programming mechanism using the Function Tables as program ROM, an idea included in the ENIAC patent and proposed independently by Richard Clippinger of BRL. Clippinger consulted with von Neumann on what instruction set to implement. Clippinger had thought of a 3-address architecture while von Neumann proposed a 1-address architecture because it was simpler to implement. Three digits of one <b>accumulator</b> (6) were used as the program counter, another <b>accumulator</b> (15) {{was used as the}} main <b>accumulator,</b> a third <b>accumulator</b> (8) was used as the address pointer for reading data from the function tables, and most of the other accumulators (1–5, 7, 9–14, 17–19) were used for data memory.|$|E
25|$|In any {{mechanical}} calculator, in effect, a gear, sector, or some similar device {{moves the}} <b>accumulator</b> {{by the number}} of gear teeth that corresponds to the digit being added or subtracted – three teeth changes the position by a count of three. The great majority of basic calculator mechanisms move the <b>accumulator</b> by starting, then moving at a constant speed, and stopping. In particular, stopping is critical, because to obtain fast operation, the <b>accumulator</b> needs to move quickly. Variants of Geneva drives typically block overshoot (which, of course, would create wrong results).|$|E

25|$|Armstrong was {{responsible}} for developing the hydraulic <b>accumulator.</b> Where water pressure was not available on site {{for the use of}} hydraulic cranes, Armstrong often built high water towers to provide a supply of water at pressure. However, when supplying cranes for use at New Holland on the Humber Estuary, he was unable to do this because the foundations consisted of sand. After much careful thought he produced the weighted <b>accumulator,</b> a cast-iron cylinder fitted with a plunger supporting a very heavy weight. The plunger would slowly be raised, drawing in water, until the downward force of the weight was sufficient to force the water below it into pipes at great pressure. The <b>accumulator</b> was a very significant, if unspectacular, invention, which found many applications in the following years.|$|E
