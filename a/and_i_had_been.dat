500|$|The critic Eduard Hanslick {{objected to}} the {{religious}} air surrounding Parsifal even at the premiere: [...] "The question of whether Parsifal should really be withheld from all theatres and limited to... Bayreuth was naturally on all tongues... I must state here that the church scenes in Parsifal {{did not make the}} offensive impression on me that others <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> led to expect from reading the libretto. They are religious situations – but for all their earnest dignity they are not {{in the style of the}} church, but completely in the style of the opera. Parsifal is an opera, call it a 'stage festival' or 'consecrational stage festival' if you will." ...|$|E
500|$|Peckinpah's {{intake of}} alcohol {{increased}} dramatically while making The Getaway, {{and he was}} fond of saying, [...] "I can't direct when I'm sober." [...] He and McQueen got into occasional heated arguments during filming. The director recalled one such incident {{on the first day of}} rehearsal in San Marcos: [...] "Steve <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> discussing some point on which we disagreed, so he picked up this bottle of champagne and threw it at me. I saw it coming and ducked. And Steve just laughed." [...] McQueen had a knack with props, especially the weapons he used in the film. Hill remembered, [...] "You can see Steve's military training in his films. He was so brisk and confident in the way he handled the guns." [...] It was McQueen's idea to have his character shoot and blow up a squad car in the scene where Doc holds two police officers at gunpoint.|$|E
500|$|Before All My Children {{offered him}} {{the role of}} Dimitri Marick, Nader already planned on working in both Los Angeles and New York. [...] "My fiancee, Beth Windsor, had {{literally}} just worked into being bicoastal," [...] he said. [...] "She had an apartment here <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> seeking out some theater here in New York {{and would have been}} spending time both here and in L.A. So after we made the decision to go ahead with that game plan, this offer (Dimitri) came on the table and when we worked out all the figures moneywise it was a great opportunity." [...] Despite Nader's prime time success as Dynasty's Dex Dexter, he did not look down on daytime television. [...] "The {{fact of the matter is}} we're in a different era," [...] he said. [...] "And if you look at the cutbacks in Hollywood, being on a soap is not of any less or more value than being in any other medium at this time." [...] Another factor that contributed to his decision to join All My Children was the actors strike. He intended to stay on All My Children for a year. That year turned into more because the actor fell in love with New York.|$|E

2500|$|The band went on hiatus from 2000 to 2003, with Claypool later stating: [...] "The {{end of the}} Nineties was {{an unhappy}} Primus camp.

2500|$|In 1960, when Vaughan was {{six years}} old, he began {{stealing}} his father's drinks. Drawn in by its effects, he started making his own drinks and this resulted in alcohol dependency. He explained: [...] "That's when I first started stealing daddy's drinks. Or when my parents were gone, I'd find the bottle and make myself one. I thought it was cool...thought the kids down the street would think it was cool. That's where it began, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> depending on it ever since." [...] According to the authors Joe Nick Patoski and Bill Crawford: [...] "In the ensuing twenty-five years, he had {{worked his way through}} the Physicians' Desk Reference before finding his poisons of preference—alcohol and cocaine." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{incredible}} really. In 1977, I flew over to England {{with the players}} {{and that was the}} flight on which Rodney Marsh broke the world beer drinking record. Three-quarters of the players on that flight had signed these sensational Packer contracts and they were all as drunk as you could imagine. But the secret still didn't get out. I sat beside Hookesy on the flight over <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> best man at his wedding and not even he breathed a word of it to me... I went up and talked to Hookesy he said: [...] "Sorry mate, I didn't know whether you had signed or not." [...] Hookesy said he had wanted to tell me, but he just couldn't.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, Lloyd Webber {{contacted}} Cameron Mackintosh, the co-producer of Cats and Song and Dance, {{to propose}} a new musical. He was aiming for a romantic piece, and suggested Gaston Leroux's book The Phantom of the Opera as a basis. They screened both the 1925 Lon Chaney and the 1943 Claude Rains motion picture versions, but neither saw {{an effective way to}} make the leap from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: [...] "I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the reason I was hung up was because I was trying to write a major romantic story, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> trying to do that ever since I started my career. Then with the Phantom, it was there!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Vera {{decided to}} call Inayat Khan back to London, to meet and talk. Vilayet Inayat Khan remembered trying to stop his sister going on her mission exactly {{the time of this}} meeting. [...] "You see, Nora <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> brought up with the policy of Gandhi's nonviolence, and at the {{outbreak}} of war we discussed what we would do," [...] said Vilayet, who had followed his father and become a Sufi mystic. [...] "She said, 'Well, I must do something, but I don't want to kill anyone.' So I said, 'Well, {{if we are going to}} join the war, we have to involve ourselves in the most dangerous positions, which would mean no killing.' [...] "Then, when we eventually go to England, I volunteered for minesweeping and she volunteered for SOE, and so I have always had a feeling of guilt because of what I said that day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parks {{initially}} {{became aware}} of the Beach Boys during their early popularity in the early 1960s. Speaking of them in 1995, he said, [...] "I knew they didn't surf.…I felt some resentment about , <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a fan of Four Freshmen and 5 Trombones.…Instinctively, I was not a Beach Boy fan. 'Something really dumb about it.'" [...] He added that, [...] "I loved Pet Sounds, you see. I came back to love them, and thought they had done a great job. It seemed to me that they would be fine in fighting spirit to take on this challenge of wresting that trophy {{out of the hands of}} those interlopers." [...] Parks has gone on to call Wilson [...] "the biggest event of that era" [...] but is hesitant to label him a [...] "genius," [...] believing Wilson to be more [...] "a lucky guy with a tremendous amount of talent and a lot of people collaborating beautifully around him." ...|$|E
