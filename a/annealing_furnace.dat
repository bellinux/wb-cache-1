Strip steel is easy off tracking. So, strip steel deviation correction sensor must be set in <b>anneal</b> <b>furnace.</b> Strip steel deviation correction check control system must be set on strip steel production line. Electromagnetic inductance strip steel deviation correction sensor was designed independently by electromagnetic induction principle in this paper to work in <b>anneal</b> <b>furnace.</b> Its structure form is centring check form. The technique quotas of this sensor are same as similar product of Germany EMG Company. SolidWorks software was adopted to construct the right half part model of sensor metal frame. Transient state heat analysis and heat structure coupling analysis were made on relative model by ANSYS software. The influence rules of temperature field and gravity field on sense structure deformation were found. Strip steel deviation correction check control system was designed. Prepositive amplification rectification circuit was designed. Second order infinite gain multiple circuit feedback lowpass smoothing circuit was designed. This research provides important reference base on realizing nationalization of import electromagnetic induction deviation correction sensor and enhancing automation level of inland cold rolling strip steel equipments.

50|$|Production of {{galvannealed}} {{sheet steel}} begins with {{hot dip galvanization}} of sheet steel. After passing through the galvanizing zinc bath the sheet steel passes through air knives to remove excess zinc, and is then heated in an <b>annealing</b> <b>furnace</b> for several seconds causing iron and zinc layers to diffuse into one another causing the formation of zinc-iron alloy layers at the surface. The annealing step is performed with the strip still hot after the galvanizing step, with the zinc still liquid. The galvanising bath contains slightly over 0.1% aluminium, added to form a layer bonding between the iron and coated zinc. Annealing temperatures are around 500 to 565 °C. Pre-1990 annealing lines used gas-fired heating; post-1990s the use of induction furnaces became common.|$|E

At Bagot's Park, Staffordshire, one such glasshouse has been recovered, which dates from circa 1535; it contained an early melting furnace and a smaller <b>annealing</b> <b>furnace.</b> [...] The melting furnace had two siege benches for the placement of three crucible pots, each with a central flue cut into the floor to create a draught {{that would allow the}} furnace to achieve 1200 °C in order to melt the glass. Fritting, and the preheating of crucibles may have occurred in the upper areas of the main furnace. Annealing (glass) and glass blowing probably occurred using a smaller furnace. Cullet heaps of broken glass residue were found on either side, suggesting the use of a flux to reduce melting temperatures. Some crushed white pebbles were recovered in the bottom of pots, and this may reflect the silica source used at this site. The glass recovered from Bagot's Park was badly weathered, yet the ends of broad glass and crown glass suggest that window and vessel glass were produced.|$|E
