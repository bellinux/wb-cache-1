5|$|Northcott {{spent much}} of his time from 1943 on in a long battle with the {{government}} over the number of men and women <b>allocated</b> <b>to</b> the Army. He attempted to do so without Blamey being dragged into a political fight but this proved to be impossible. In September 1944, the government reduced the Army's monthly intake of women from 925 to 500, while it only received 420 out of 4,020 men <b>allocated</b> <b>to</b> the three services. Such a meagre allocation was below what the Army needed to maintain its strength, and formations had to be disbanded. Blamey took up the matter with Prime Minister John Curtin, and managed to get a more satisfactory monthly allocation of 1,500 men per month out of 3,000 <b>allocated</b> <b>to</b> the three services.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of endowing the social parameter, autonomy, on a {{distributed}} sensor network. The sensor network is used for surveillance of multiple targets that crisscross a rectangular surveillance zone. Crossing targets are ascribed priorities by a priority ascription scheme based on fuzzy inference methods. The scheme fuses local and global priorities of a target through autonomy modeled as a parameter that take values in [0, 1]. Sensors coordinate <b>to</b> <b>allocate</b> themselves <b>to</b> a particular target. Autonomy affects {{the manner in which}} sensors <b>allocate</b> themselves <b>to</b> a target. Lower autonomy biases a sensor <b>to</b> <b>allocate</b> itself <b>to</b> a target that need not be tracked or tracked for shorter duration. Higher autonomy biases a sensor <b>to</b> <b>allocate</b> itself <b>to</b> a target that needs to be tracked for longer duration. Test cases are presented regarding how changes in autonomy affect the tracking performance of the system. Conclusions are derived that suggest when high or low values of autonomy are beneficial to the system...|$|R
