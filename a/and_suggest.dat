Some describe his playing as cold <b>and</b> <b>suggest</b> that his innovations had little impact; others state {{that he was a}} bridge between bebop and later, freer forms of jazz, and assert that he is less appreciated than he should be because commentators found him hard to categorize and because he chose not to commercialize.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{appointment}} as Minister for Defence following the 1998 federal election, John Moore {{decided that the}} only way to solve the various problems of the Collins class was for an independent report to be prepared on them.

5|$|Heating in Enceladus has {{occurred}} through various mechanisms ever since its formation. Radioactive decay in its core may have initially heated it, {{giving it a}} warm core and a subsurface ocean, which is now kept above freezing through an unidentified mechanism. Geophysical models indicate that tidal heating is a main heat source, perhaps aided by radioactive decay and some heat-producing chemical reactions. A 2007 study predicted the internal heat of Enceladus, if generated by tidal forces, could be no greater than 1.1 gigawatts, but data from Cassini's infrared spectrometer of the south polar terrain over 16 months, indicate that the internal heat generated power is about 4.7 gigawatts, <b>and</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that it is in}} thermal equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|In August 1863, {{as part of}} {{his duties}} as aide-de-camp to General Barnard, Alexander was named {{as a member of a}} board of {{military}} officers who would examine the defenses of Washington <b>and</b> <b>suggest</b> improvements as needed. The board, created by the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, was designed to replace a civilian board that he had created in 1862. In a November 1863 meeting, this board recommended final allotments of guns and ammunition for the forts protecting Washington, D.C., thus establishing the number of guns that would be in place during the Battle of Fort Stevens eight months later.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Tiggy-winkle {{has been}} {{described}} as one of Potter's most positive creations, but critics consider Lucie an artistic failure. Although Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is set in an identifiable place and time period, the tale is mythologized by reaching back to an age when household chores were performed manually and without the aid of modern mechanical inventions. The simple dwellings, rustic pathways, and stone fences enhance the tale's timeless aspect <b>and</b> <b>suggest</b> an unchanging countryside and its way of life.|$|E

5|$|Peel {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for trying new methods within the industry, {{being one of the}} first textile manufacturers to use carding cylinders. He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until, according to family tradition, his young daughter Anne brought him a sprig of parsley and begged him {{to use it as a}} pattern. He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane <b>and</b> <b>suggest</b> a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the cloth to finish it.|$|E
5|$|The Papuan swiftlet, Aerodramus papuensis, {{has three}} toes {{instead of the}} usual four in this group. It has the ability to echolocate, but whereas other {{previously}} studied species use echolocation primarily while flying in their caves, the Papuan swiftlet appears to be nocturnal or crepuscular and uses echolocation while active outside at night. It uses single, not double, clicks. DNA sequence data provides strong support for a basal relationship between A. papuensis and other Aerodramus taxa <b>and</b> <b>suggest</b> that this species and the waterfall swift Hydrochous gigas, are sister taxa, a relationship that would indicate paraphyly of the genus Aerodramus.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origins of}} Styracosaurus were not understood {{for many years}} because fossil evidence for early ceratopsians was sparse. The discovery of Protoceratops, in 1922, shed light on early ceratopsid relationships, but several decades passed before additional finds filled in more of the blanks. Fresh discoveries in the late 1990s and 2000s, including Zuniceratops, the earliest known ceratopsian with brow horns, and Yinlong, the first known Jurassic ceratopsian, indicate what the ancestors of Styracosaurus may have looked like. These new discoveries have been important in illuminating the origins of horned dinosaurs in general, <b>and</b> <b>suggest</b> that the group originated during the Jurassic in Asia, {{with the appearance of}} true horned ceratopsians occurring {{by the beginning of the}} late Cretaceous in North America.|$|E
5|$|Though the extinctions {{occurred}} {{at the same time}} as the Chicxulub asteroid impact strongly supports the impact hypothesis of extinction, some scientists continue to dispute the role of the Chicxulub impact in driving the extinction, <b>and</b> <b>suggest</b> that other events may have contributed to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. In particular, volcanic eruptions, climate change, sea level change, and other impact events have been suggested to play a role in driving the K–Pg extinction.|$|E
