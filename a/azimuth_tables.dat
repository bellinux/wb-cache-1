The diagram is calculated for the latitude of London, but will do with more or less accuracy {{for the whole of}} England. A traveller going to other countries may easily draw up one for himself, and on a larger scale if he prefers it, by using the <b>Azimuth</b> <b>tables</b> and the Horary tables of Lynn.|$|E

"The plan of {{arrangement}} and scope were drawn by Lieut. Seaton Schroeder, U. S. N., who also computed the 34 tables from page 11, Part I to page 81, Part II, inclusive. The 88 tables from page 82, Part II, to page 135, Part II, and from page 157, Part III, to page 217, Part III, were computed by Master W. H. H. Southerland, U. S. N. The 20 tables from page 136, Part II to page 153, Part II, and from page 218, Part III to page 226, Part III, were computed by Hydrographic Engineer G. W. Littlehales. " [...] Pref., page 4.

40|$|In astro-calculation, it is {{effective}} and {{necessary for the}} education and instruction for students to make clear {{the steps of the}} many errors and their contents. The data is the same as in a previous paper. We subdivided the calculation into 22 steps, and checked on the percentage of error and its contents in detail. As a result, the percentage of error of plural steps in one astro-calculation decreased accordingly as cadets were promoted to higher classes. The highest average of the error is shown in azimuth calculation. The error of steps in which they use the Altitude and <b>Azimuth</b> <b>Tables</b> decreased with the promotion of school year and according to progress in mastering astro-calculation. But we were surprised that they made many errors in subtraction, especially in azimuth calculation, and we could see no difference between the school years. Subtraction in azimuth calculation has {{absolutely nothing to do with}} the rate of mastery of astro-calculation...|$|E

50|$|The Ex-Meridian {{method of}} calculating sights {{is at its}} most {{accurate}} when the azimuth of the object is near to south or north. As the azimuth changes towards the east or west the cross of the position line with the assumed longitude {{becomes more and more}} oblique and the position obtained is therefore less accurate. For this reason it is a less versatile method of calculating sights than the intercept method which can be used for all <b>azimuths.</b> The <b>tables</b> are a quick and easy way to correct the altitude when the object is fairly low in the sky and the observer has only missed noon by a few minutes but if noon has been missed by more than that or the sun is high in the sky it is better to work out a sight by the intercept method.|$|R
