40|$|When applied as {{a public}} <b>administrative</b> <b>norm,</b> the term and concept “transparency” has two {{intertwined}} meanings. First, it refers to those constitutional and legislative tools that require the government to disclose information in order {{to inform the public}} and create a more accountable, responsive state. Second, it operates as a metaphor that identifies and decries the distance between the public and the state, and that drives and shapes the desire for a more perfect democratic order. Viewed together, these two meanings both demand efforts to impose legal obligations on the state to be “open” and suggest that such efforts are necessary to allow the public to eradicate the state’s physical, organizational, and affective remove or mitigate its ill-effects. This article considers the implications of the latter meaning, and that meaning’s effect on efforts to develop and implement the technocratic tools in the former meaning. It argues that the state cannot in fact be made thoroughly visible - that the state’s organizational complexity, territorial dispersal across space, and enclosure within buildings inevitably obstruct the public’s view. Reviewing the law and culture of “transparency,” the article concludes that the metaphoric meaning’s logical end, a reversal of Bentham’s Panopticon, demonstrates the impossibility and unattractive consequences of imposing a fully visible state. Nevertheless, the article argues, the populist understanding of transparency is too embedded within our political culture to ignore or avoid entirely, demonstrating that technocratic advances in making the state appear more open must ultimately rely upon metaphoric, populist gestures...|$|E
40|$|The <b>administrative</b> <b>norm</b> of transparency, which {{promises}} {{a solution to}} the problem of government secrecy, requires political advocacy organized from outside the state. The traditional approach, typically the result of organized campaigns to make the state visible to the public, has been to enact freedom of information laws (FOI) that require government disclosure and grant enforceable rights to the public. The legal solution has not proven wholly satisfactory, however. In the past two decades, numerous advocacy movements have offered different fixes to the information asymmetry problem that the administrative state creates. These alternatives now augment and sometimes compete with legal transparency regimes. This Article surveys and analyzes transparency advocacy campaigns and the “fix” that each proposes to the problems created by the state’s asymmetrical information advantage over the public. It sketches the history of four campaigns: the FOI movement in the U. S., the global anti-corruption movement (spearheaded by Transparency International), the digital transparency movement, and WikiLeaks. The Article offers two insights. First, although these movements share a basic set of assumptions and tell a similar policy story — secrecy is a pressing administrative problem that can be fixed with the right policies and institutional arrangements — they diverge significantly in how they understand not only the problem’s causes but the state itself. Second, and as a result, the Article unveils transparency as a contested political issue which masquerades as an administrative tool. Rooted in contestable claims about the state’s legitimacy and performance, the transparency fix leads to tendentious prescriptions about law, policy, and the state...|$|E

40|$|When applied as {{a public}} <b>administrative</b> <b>norm,</b> the term and concept “transparency” has two {{intertwined}} meanings. First, it refers to those technocratic, constitutional and legislative tools that require the government to disclose information in order {{to inform the public}} and create a more accountable, responsive state. Second, in its use of metaphor, “transparency” identifies and decries the distance between the public and the state. Viewed together, both meanings demand efforts to impose legal obligations on the state to be “open,” and in the process suggest that such efforts are necessary to allow the public to eradicate the state’s physical, organizational, and affective remove or mitigate its ill-effects. But the meanings also operate in tension. The latter, populist understanding of transparency, with its desire to eradicate or at least mitigate the distance between the state and public and open government to its citizens’ gaze, drives efforts to develop and implement the institutional and legal frameworks described in the technocratic understanding of the term. Although the desire to view the state results in an understandable and warranted commitment to uphold democratic principles, the state cannot in fact be made thoroughly visible. The contemporary American state is extraordinarily complex, and the organizational structure that the Constitution established neither disaggregates the complexity nor identifies simple institutional means for making the state’s multitudinous parts visible to the public. Federal and state statutes provide only piecemeal solutions, and the state’s increasing reliance upon private actors for information and services makes the enforcement of constitutional and statutory transparency requirements even more difficult to achieve. Such problems are compounded by the government’s sprawl across space, in national, state, and local jurisdictions, and in enclosed buildings that exclude the public and allow the government both to function and to hide. Reviewing the law and culture of “transparency,” the article concludes that the metaphoric meaning’s logical end, a reversal of Bentham’s Panopticon, demonstrates the impossibility and unattractive consequences of imposing a fully visible state. Nevertheless, the article argues, the populist understanding of transparency is too embedded within our political culture to ignore or avoid entirely, demonstrating that technocratic advances in making the state appear more open must ultimately rely upon metaphoric, populist gestures...|$|E
40|$|The {{normative}} {{concept of}} transparency, {{along with the}} open government laws that purport to create a transparent public system of governance promise the world—a democratic and accountable state above all, and a peaceful, prosperous, and efficient one as well. But transparency, in its role as the theoretical justification {{for a set of}} legal commands, frustrates all parties affected by its ambiguities and abstractions. The public’s engagement with transparency in practice yields denials of reasonable requests for essential government information, as well as government meetings that occur behind closed doors. Meanwhile, state officials bemoan the significantly impaired decision-making processes that result from complying with transparency’s sweeping and powerful legal mandates, and complain about transparency’s enormous compliance costs. This article argues that the frustrations with creating an open government originate in the concept of “transparency” itself, which fails to consider the tensions it conceals. The easy embrace of transparency as a basis for normative and utilitarian ends evades more difficult questions: When is transparency most important as an <b>administrative</b> <b>norm?</b> To what extent should an agency be held to that norm? Open government laws fall short in answering these questions because, relying on the assumptions of “transparency,” they typically operate at exceptionally high levels of abstraction. As a result, they establish both broad mandates for disclosure and broad authority for the exercise of a state privilege of non-disclosure, and they ultimately fail to produce an effective, mutually acceptable level of administrative openness. Transparency theory’s flaws result from a simplistic model of linear communication which assumes that information, once set free from the state that creates it, will produce an informed, engaged public that will hold officials accountable. To the extent that this model fails to describe accurately the state, government information, and the public, as well as the communications process of which they are component parts, it provides a flawed basis for open government laws. The article critiques the assumptions embedded in transparency theory and suggests an alternative approach to open government laws that would allow a more flexible, sensitive means to evaluate {{the costs and benefits of}} information disclosure. It also proposes institutional alternatives to the current default regime in open government laws, which relies on weak judicial enforcement of disclosure mandates, and offers substantive suggestions that would improve efforts to establish a more accountable state and informed public...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 1980 ’s  Swedish {{county council}} {{managers}} has been preoccupied with planning and implementing organisational change in order to alleviate the financial problems and to create more efficient production systems.  Many of these efforts to change have implied changing the systems for management accounting and control, changes that have been inspired both by market-oriented ideologies and by the governance principles of large corporations in the private sector. Literature on manage­ment accounting and control indicates however, that management is unintentionally contributing to the creation of organisational inertia and conservatism. This contradiction is formulated as a change dilemma; ”How can managerial principles that make organizations subject to  bureaucratization and inertia be used as important strategies for organizational change?” The purpose of the study is thus to analyze the use of management control systems as organizational change strategies in health care, employing a change perspective on management control. When used as a change strategy,  management accounting and control becomes manifest as management control initiatives. Actors handle these control inititatives by organising themselves around the issue at hand. This organising process ends or fades away when there are no need for further attention to the control initiative. Empirical studies were made in the councils of Västerbotten, Sörmland and Upp­sala counties. Management control initiatives investigated were performance-related pay, quality improvement work, systematic planning procedures, provider/purchaser-models, downsizing projects and profit center systems. The systems for management accounting and control appeared to structure health care organisations in terms of spatial structuring temporal structuring and actor categorization. The management control initiatives introduced were structured as extraordinary organising processes delimited in terms of space, time and involved actors. Actors in the <b>administrative</b> <b>norm</b> system participated with the intention to change the organisation, while those in the medical norm system aimed at just handling the initiative. Management control initiatives can therefore be seen as passing opportunities to change, passing {{in the sense that the}} organising processes are temporary by nature, opportunities in the sense that temporary re-coupling can be used to  achieve long-term change.  One such opportunity is the formulation of control initiatives; the possibility of using simple and standardized change strategies can be useful, but only if they are also linked to the medical norm system. A second opportunity is the temporary organising processes; if the project form of organising change can also be conveyed to the medical norm system, management control initiatives could result in short, intense courses of events that actually change things. The third opportunity  s the recurrent  cyc ica  pro­ perties  of  management  accounting  and control  systems, enabling  recurrent  activities around the same themes, thereby keeping them alive.

The authors identify two types of government structures influence on the business entities, differentiated {{by the nature of the}} targeting impact on the economic activity of business structures — the administrative pressure and administrative assistance. It is suggested that in practice, high cost implications for compliance with all regulation requirements as well as sanctions for the violation of these requirements create preconditions for the development of informal interaction between entrepreneurs and the representatives of regulatory bodies. Therefore, businessmen try to minimize the costs associated with the implementation of formal administrative requirements, rules and regulations by personal arrangements. A mathematical model for the assessment of the informal interaction between business entities and certain officials of control supervisory authorities is proposed.

The analysis is {{based on interviews with}} six social workers operating in different districts of the city. The paper interprets discursive and ideological dimensions of social policies, highlighting the mechanisms by which the welfare programs and practices define the needs of lone mothers. It outlines the dynamics of negotiation in the welfare services, which try to reconcile the legislative and <b>administrative</b> <b>norms</b> with the social workers' professional practices and the lone mothers' claims. |The analysis rejects the commonplace view that social welfare beneficiaries are exclusively people in 'extreme discomfort', and presents two biographical pathways through which lone mothers turn to welfare services. The social workers' image of the two subcultures of lone mothers influences their attitudes and the strategies they set in motion for lone mothers. | Despite the Veneto region's universal law on social assistance, access to economic support is determined more selectively through proving a 'qualifying need'. Interpreting lone mothers¿ claims as qualifying needs along psycho-social and educational dimensions serves to transform their expressed claims into claims that can be dealt with institutionally. Social workers prefer to supply 'professional' psycho-social support for lone mothers, using their major discretion in that area. They explicitly aim at helping mothers to recover their resources so that they are able to maintain themselves and their children through paid work. Lone mothers seem to acquire a specific position among users of welfare services, as social workers perceive their problems as more complex and sound than those of other users. Therefore lone mothers are provided with a broader range of discretionary support...|$|R

40|$|Nepalese {{bureaucracy}} {{is accused}} of being inefficient, corrupt, non-transparent and irresponsible. It is also said that Afno Manchhe and Chakari, which is deeply rooted in Nepalese social values, is also highly institutionalized in the Nepalese administration. Many studies have revealed that socio-cultural values affect the administrative system of a country. Upon this background, this study aimed to map the existing administrative culture in Nepal and examine whether socio-cultural values of Nepal affect administrative culture. This study revealed that Nepalese civil service is characterized by values that may be termed bureau-pathology. This is because the administration is guided strongly by particularism rather than universalism, ascription rather than achievement, and authoritarian rather than participatory values. One of the basic characteristics of the Nepalese bureaucracy is that it manifests elements of both the classical and political bureaucracy. More precisely, this study revealed that civil servants do not follow prescribed rules while make administrative decisions. Most often, administrative decisions are influenced by informal sources rather than formal rules, i. e. political influence, bribery, personal connection (Afno Manchhe), and Chakari. Civil servants are guided by status oriented and empire building attitudes. Common <b>administrative</b> <b>norms</b> include slow decision making processes, maintaining high levels of secrecy, ritualized official work, and shifting responsibility to others. There is also great emphasis on process rather than results. In addition, high power distance between superior and subordinates, centralized and non-participatory decision making processes are basic features of the Nepalese administration. This study also uncovered the close relationship between societal culture in Nepal and administrative culture. In fact, Nepalese societal culture {{is determined by the}} caste system, family structure, and other belief systems that are ultimately reflected in the administrative system.

40|$|The new {{terrain of}} {{increasing}} interaction between national and supranational legal systems within the European Union presents new challenges for conventional approaches to police accountability and transparency. Each EU Member State {{is responsible for}} policing within its jurisdiction, and the EU institutions are increasingly responsible for enhancing the conduct of police cooperation between the Member States. The thesis explores the challenges of reconciling national approaches in the international sphere by conducting a critical analysis of ‘how {{and to what extent}} national legal and <b>administrative</b> <b>norms</b> on police accountability and transparency are informing the concept, design and operation of EU cross-border policing instruments’. Building on the work of Peter K. Manning, Geoffrey Marshall and David Bayley amongst others, the thesis develops a pragmatic typology of police accountability through which to view the evolution and adequacy of national and supranational approaches. The typology contains three key dimensions, namely codes, co-option and complaint. Using the typology to critique conventional approaches in the UK, Ireland and Denmark, the thesis identifies legal and procedural anomalies and challenges at both the national and supranational level since the traditional elements of police accountability were originally formulated within the confines of national legal, political, historical and cultural constraints. Employing the typology to both elucidate problems and suggest methods of internalisation, the thesis argues that the EU should follow the lead of the Member States’ legislatures by seeking to regulate a wider range of policing processes through more expansive procedural ‘codes’ which facilitate police discretion and co-option. The thesis shows that it is not sufficient for the EU to prioritise its post-Lisbon policy of ‘co-decision’ in order to remedy its democratic deficits but that it must oversee the establishment and enhancement of parliamentary committees, inspectorates and other oversight bodies in the interest of police accountability. A number of recommendations are made for police reform at both the national and supranational levels to this end. More particularly, the research indicates that additional treaty changes are needed beyond the Lisbon Treaty in order to adequately reconcile national and supranational approaches to police accountability.

40|$|Administrative {{agencies}} play {{a crucial}} role in American government, so unsurprisingly, their actions sometimes threaten individual rights. Despite this threat, courts determining whether a constitutional individual right has been violated often ignore the fact and nature of administrative action. Indeed, in a wide range of cases alleging the violation of an individual right, the Supreme Court reflexively defers to the government without asking whether administrative officials or more directly accountable political representatives were responsible for the alleged infringement. Even when the Court identifies these distinctions, its treatment is inconsistent and inchoate. This Article argues that courts should more consistently and carefully consider the nature of administrative discretion when determining whether an agency has violated a substantive individual right. Instead of casually conflating administrative and legislative action, courts deciding such cases should identify the relevant constitutional actor. When that actor is an agency, courts should then draw on <b>administrative</b> law <b>norms</b> to examine whether the agency deserves deference. Such an approach would help courts avoid the unjustified deference they sometimes offer agencies in individual rights cases, thus encouraging constitutional adherence and assuring independent judicial evaluation of the alleged constitutional injury...|$|R

But {{the reality of}} the administrative state departs starkly from this model. One such departure is the use of audited self-regulatory organizations (SROs) [...] private organizations comprised of specific industries that formulate binding law to regulate themselves. Although SROs operate subject to the oversight of federal agencies, their power is vast, reaching significant swaths of the national and international economies. There is little to constitutionally constrain such arrangements, and whereas the administrative law model values the norms of participation, deliberation, and transparency, the procedures used by SROs depart from these norms in important ways. Moreover, oversight agencies are deferential to SROs, and courts in turn are deferential to the oversight agencies. This doubling of deference both undermines accountability and fails to adequately guard against arbitrariness. This Article brings a much-needed administrative law lens to SROs, providing both a positive and theoretical account of SROs and exposing flaws in the model. To better ameliorate these concerns, this Article illustrates how existing administrative law can more comprehensively account for SROs and offers a series of institutional design considerations for furthering <b>administrative</b> law <b>norms</b> in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the concept of sovereignty and international organizations is often posed as being problematic. The establishment and subsequent operations of international organizations are often characterized as involving the 2 ̆ 7 loss 2 ̆ 7 of a State 2 ̆ 7 s sovereignty and as such have been viewed with suspicion, if not antagonism, by certain domestic commentators. The response in legal journals by supporters of international organizations has been too narrow, technical, and often simply reaffirms the fears of the domestic commentators by focusing on how the organization 2 ̆ 7 s exercise of powers constrains the State {{in the exercise of}} its powers. The approach adopted herein is different. It involves a focus on the essentially contested nature of the concept of sovereignty and contends that this nature is the same whether sovereign powers are being exercised on the domestic or international planes. This unity of identity has two main consequences for our discussion of international organizations: first, it provides a cogent reason for the existence of international organizations; and second, it provides a rationale for the construction of the normative framework that governs international organizations in the exercise of their delegated powers of government by recourse, in part, to domestic public and <b>administrative</b> law <b>norms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Should {{agencies}} receive Chevron deference when {{interpreting the}} reach of their own jurisdiction? This article argues that, in general, they should not. We begin by identifying and detailing the various different types of jurisdictional questions that may arise in statutory interpretation. The article then surveys how the Supreme Court and lower federal courts have analyzed these {{different aspects of the}} jurisdiction problem, with a particular attention to statutory silences. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s Chevron jurisprudence strongly suggest that deference to agency determinations of their own jurisdiction should be disfavored, particularly where a statute is silent (and not merely ambiguous) about the existence of agency jurisdiction. In particular, we argue that courts should deny Chevron deference regardless of whether an agency is asserting or disclaiming jurisdiction. This no-deference rule should apply in both existence- and scope-of-power cases, but courts should continue to show deference where agencies assert the existence of a factual predicate that triggers jurisdiction. We support our proposal with arguments drawing on both traditional <b>administrative</b> law <b>norms</b> and public choice analyses of the incentives faced by agencies and other relevant actors. While there are strong counterarguments to our proposal - particularly the potential difficulty in distinguishing between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional questions - this article maintains that denying deference in the jurisdictional context is desirable and consistent with Chevron principles...|$|R

Drawing from various cases (primarily between 2010 - 2013), this study resonates with significant contributions of urban geographers {{to understand the}} ways that various forms of urban governance, placed subjectivities and political economy help to produce U. S. cities. This research provides a trialectic understanding of forces shaping downtown redevelopment, powers of: social memory; city policies and mechanisms; and economic investment. These forces constantly appear throughout the remaining pages and are informed by each other at times in reactive ways while in other moments in conciliatory ways. Each of these forces [...] social memory, city policies and mechanisms, and economic development [...] circulate within a complex of social relations and each, in varying ways (re) produces <b>administrative</b> and institutional <b>norms</b> and juridical regulations...|$|R
40|$|To {{begin the}} {{analysis}} of Japanese regulation, Part I looks closely at the structure {{and implementation of the}} Large Scale Retail Stores Law (“LSRSL”) by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (“MITI”). The LSRSL and its implementation are representative of Japanese agency practice, and their detailed description can aid in forming preliminary generalizations about the legal nature and explanations for the delegation of power to private parties that this Article argues comprises Japanese regulatory style. To confirm the representative nature of administrative practice under the LSRSL and to provide additional breadth to the analysis, Part II looks at instances of delegation in several other areas of bureaucratic practice from MITI supervision of structural adjustment under declining industries statutes to the granting of broadcast licenses by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (“MPT”). In order {{to get a sense of}} the preconditions and limitations of this style of regulation, Part II also examines the less successful use of similar regulatory techniques in both economic regulation and by local governments interested in controlling land use within their jurisdictions. Part III draws on U. S. <b>administrative</b> law <b>norms</b> and European regulatory theory to refine the model of privatized regulation that emerges from Parts I and II. The Conclusion assesses the likelihood that recent legal and political changes in Japan and growing international pressures for transparency in domestic administrative processes will lead to changes in Japanese regulatory style in the near future...|$|R
