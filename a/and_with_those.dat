A week later they surrendered, with many mercenaries and some Swedish abandoning their banners and insignia, and changing sides. As {{a result of the}} series of Swedish defeats in spring 1627, they lost all their strongholds on {{the west bank of the}} Vistula, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>those,</b> their hopes for a quick and decisive victory. The situation also convinced the Elector of Brandenburg to declare his support for the Commonwealth, and afterwards the Lithuanian forces resumed their offensive in Livonia.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture was {{the primary}} source of revenue in the Mamluk economy. Agricultural {{products}} were the main exports of Mamluk Egypt, Syria and Palestine. Moreover, the major industries of sugar and textile production were also dependent on agricultural products, namely sugar cane and cotton, respectively. Every agricultural commodity was taxed by the state, with the sultan's treasury taking the largest share of the revenues; emirs and major private brokers followed. An emir's main source of income were the agricultural products of his iqtaʿ, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> revenues, he was able to fund his private corps.|$|E
25|$|In June 1917, {{and holding}} the {{temporary}} rank of general, Byng took command of Britain's largest army, the Third Army, until the cessation of hostilities <b>and,</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> troops, conducted at the Battle of Cambrai the first surprise attack using tanks. This was later considered {{a turning point in}} the war and Byng was honoured on 24 November 1917 by having his temporary rank of general made substantive, as well as being made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1919 New Year's Honours. In the United States, Byng's exploits during the First World War were commemorated near the town of Ada, Oklahoma, when in 1917 a post office and power plant were named after him, leading to the later emergence of the town of Byng. Further, Byng was in his own right elevated on 7 October 1919 to the peerage as Baron Byng of Vimy, of Thorpe-le-Soken in the County of Essex. The next month, though he was offered the Southern Command, Byng retired from the military and moved to Thorpe Hall. In April 1921, he unveiled the Chipping Barnet War Memorial, near to his family seat of Wrotham Park.|$|E
500|$|The {{conspiracy}} came {{apart when}} {{two of the}} thieves turned state evidence and Alexander was exonerated in court. Babcock was named {{as part of the}} conspiracy, but later acquitted in the trial against the burglars; evidence suggests that the jury had been tampered with. Evidence also suggests that Babcock was involved with the swindles by the corrupt Washington contractors' ring <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> who wanted to get back at Columbus Alexander, an avid reformer and critic of the Grant Administration. [...] In 1876 Grant dismissed Babcock from the White House under public pressure due to Babcock's unpopularity. Babcock continued in government work, and became Chief Light House Inspector. In 1883, Babcock drowned at sea at the age of 48 while supervising the building of Mosquito Inlet Light station.|$|E

500|$|In May 1904, Hill {{sold the}} Weekly Fairbanks News to R.J. McChesney, who {{invested}} in a Linotype machine and a larger press. These improvements and the growing population of Fairbanks — by 1905, it had 2,500 residents — allowed the Weekly Fairbanks News to expand to semi-weekly, then daily publication, in the process becoming the Fairbanks Daily News on July 1, 1905. On September 3, the News had its first competition when the Fairbanks Sunday Times began publishing on the sole day that the News did not. Other papers soon arrived in the area. In 1906, the Valdez News reported, [...] "With the newspaper plans already in Fairbanks <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>those</b> which are being shipped there this year, the Tanana metropolis will be well supplied. There are no less than five of them all told ..." [...] In May 1906, McChesney sold the Daily News to Fairbanks' founder, Ebenezer Barnette.
