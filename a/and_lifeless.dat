5|$|Optimus {{is given}} the task of {{removing}} the Dark Energon from Cybertron's core by the council. Optimus and his old friend Ironhide, along with rookie Autobot soldier Warpath first attempt to rescue Omega Supreme from the Decepticons, who is being tortured by Dark Energon. They call in Ratchet who heals Omega Supreme. The Autobots free Omega Supreme and gain access to Cybertron's core. Struggling against a mysterious corrupted worm and countless Decepticons, Optimus then speaks with Cybertron's core, which informs him {{that it has been}} heavily damaged by the Dark Energon. It states that it can repair itself by shutting down, but the process will take millions of years during which Cybertron will become cold, barren, <b>and</b> <b>lifeless.</b> The core then tells Optimus that if he carries a small piece of the core with him, the core can still survive during the repairs. Optimus accepts the burden and the core relinquishes the Autobot Matrix of Leadership.|$|E

It first picked up the master who was in a life ring, exhausted, and after some difficulty was gotten aboard over the stern. Another then clambered aboard; they then saw a man face down <b>and</b> <b>lifeless</b> who they managed to drag aboard. After they worked on him for 20 minutes he regained consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Skins from dry and hot-climate {{areas and}} poorly fed goats are {{preferred}} for djembes {{because of their}} low fat content. Skins from cold-climate goats with high-value nutrition have {{more than double the}} fat content; they tend to sound dull <b>and</b> <b>lifeless</b> in comparison. Even though the fat content of male goats is lower than that of female goats, many players prefer female skins because they do not smell as strongly and are reputed to be softer.|$|E

25|$|Tuonela was {{the land}} of dead. It was an {{underground}} home or city for all the dead people, not only the good or the bad ones. It was a dark <b>and</b> <b>lifeless</b> place, where everybody slept forever. Still a brave shaman could travel to Tuonela in trance {{to ask for the}} forefathers' guidance. To travel to Tuonela, the soul had to cross the dark river of Tuonela. If the shaman had a proper reason, then a boat would come to take them over. Many times a shaman's soul had to trick the guards of Tuonela into believing that they were actually dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{left wing}} depicts the {{beheading}} of St John the Baptist. His headless body {{lies in the}} left foreground and seems to reach out of the picture, as blood spurts from his severed neck, spraying his hands and the nearby plants. The foreground in the flora are reduced {{to the extent that}} they could not have been painted without a magnifying glass. The executioner stands with his back to the viewer, placing the freshly severed head on Salome's platter. The executioner, Salome, and three gesticulating bystanders form a circle around John's headless <b>and</b> <b>lifeless</b> body. According to Ridderbos, the five figures mirror and create a sense of unity with the five holy figures in the central panel. The scene is set in a courtyard in front of Herod's palace; the banquet that preceded the Baptist's decapitation can be seen in the left-midground of the palace, where minstrels play for Salome's dance. The banquet is well-lit and with good architectural perspective. Albert Michiels described Salome as ravishing but emotionless; she receives the head, with her eyes held aloof. Other versions of St John's beheading (decollation) more typically showed Salome holding an empty plate for the executioner; with an early version typified in a miniature in the Petites Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry.|$|E
25|$|An {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt on}} the life of the king was made on 15 November 1620. It occurred on Sunday, at 9 am, when the monarch was to attend Mass in St. John's Archcathedral in Warsaw. Sigismund was to arrive by walking on a wooden bridge-looking construction that connected the Royal Castle with the temple. When the royal procession already {{reached the end of the}} bridge, hidden in a nearby window was nobleman Michał Piekarski. The assassin previously killed a Hungarian mercenary that was protecting the post. When the monarch reached the final steps, Piekarski instantly jumped out and threw himself on the king, stabbing him twice, firstly in the back and then in the cheek, and striking him in the arm. However, the assassin was not able to cause any deadly harm because of the royal guards that were initially standing to the right of the king as Piekarski attacked from the left. Shortly after the attack, Sigismund fell flat on the ground, pale <b>and</b> <b>lifeless,</b> and from the church Priest Kobierzycki started to groan and shout – he had seen the attack from the temple's stained glass window or from the belfry. A group of local civilians and citizens surrounded the procession, the king quickly fainted, and his clothes were stained in blood. The guards were able to revive the monarch, and after medical examinations the wounds proved to be harmless. A few minutes later, panic erupted in the crowd and the air filled with the atmosphere of terror. Most of the people gathered in the church, who had arrived before the royal procession, believed that the king was already dead. Initially it was thought that the capital was invaded by the Muslim Tatars or, at least, by their spies.|$|E

500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule said of Flanagan's quarter, [...] "a die designer {{could do}} little wrong in having Houdon's Neoclassic image as his prototype... Still, {{it might be}} asked {{whether or not it}} was fair to force an ideal portrait of Washington made in 1785 on an artist working in 1932. There is something cold <b>and</b> <b>lifeless</b> about the results." [...] Vermeule suggests that the quarter started a trend of similar portrait coins issued by the United States, notably the Jefferson nickel and Franklin half dollar. [...] The historian preferred Laura Fraser's version, and termed Flanagan's reverse [...] "a stiff bit of heraldry amid too large a wreath and too much or too large lettering".|$|E
500|$|Resident Evil: Afterlife was not {{screened}} {{in advance}} for critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 23% based on the reviews of 95 critics, with a rating average of 4.1 out of 10. The site's consensus states [...] "as dim-witted <b>and</b> <b>lifeless</b> as its undead antagonists, Resident Evil: Afterlife is a wholly unnecessary addition to the franchise." [...] Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 37 based on 14 reviews, indicating [...] "generally unvaforable reviews". CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a [...] "B-" [...] on an A+ to F scale.|$|E

When Brian and Stewie decide to deliver the presents for Santa, in their travel the Statue of Liberty can be seen.

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Matt Mitovich from TV Guide {{wrote that}} [...] "Larry King" [...] was [...] "pretty blah. Something about {{it just seemed}} drab <b>and</b> <b>lifeless,</b> as if the writers and cast were in a mad dash to break for Christmas." [...] The A.V. Clubs Scott Tobias {{believed}} that the episode was not up to [...] "30 Rocks high standards" [...] and commented that a [...] "big problem" [...] was Jack and Elisa's storyline. [...] "The concept of rich, superficial, commitment-phobic workaholic Jack falling for his exact opposite isn't a bad one, but Hayek's run has been {{more or less a}} wash." [...] Tobias further added that Alec Baldwin and Salma Hayek [...] "are an odd couple" [...] citing {{that they do not have}} much chemistry together.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} they claimed that {{a feeling of}} oppression and dreariness came over them. They then saw some men who looked like palace gardeners, who told them to go {{straight}} on. Moberly later described the men as [...] "very dignified officials, dressed in long greyish green coats with small three-cornered hats." [...] Jourdain noticed a cottage with {{a woman and a}} girl in the doorway. The woman was holding out a jug to the girl. Jourdain described it as a [...] "tableau vivant", a living picture, much like Madame Tussauds waxworks. Moberly did not observe the cottage, but felt the atmosphere change. She wrote: [...] "Everything suddenly looked unnatural, therefore unpleasant; even the trees seemed to become flat <b>and</b> <b>lifeless,</b> like wood worked in tapestry. There were no effects of light and shade, and no wind stirred the trees." ...|$|E
500|$|Like the Harrison–Shankar North American tour, Dark Horse {{received}} mainly unfavourable {{reviews from}} music critics, {{many of whom}} condemned Harrison for his hoarse singing and for having rushed the recording to capitalise on the tour. In his highly unfavourable critique for Rolling Stone, Jim Miller considered [...] "So Sad" [...] to be [...] "one of the album's few resonant moments" [...] and a song that [...] "probably tells the truth" [...] regarding Harrison's state of mind, unlike [...] "Bye, Bye Love", which he found [...] "a sick man's idea of a joke". Bob Woffinden of the NME labelled [...] "So Sad" [...] "a trite, self-pitying number, both unoriginal <b>and</b> <b>lifeless,</b> with the vocals again sounding portentous and unnatural". Woffinden added: [...] "When somebody sings 'While his memory raced/with much speed and great haste', you just know the lyricist is floundering and filling in lines." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna's vocal range spans {{almost one}} octave from F3 to D4. As {{she begins to}} sing the first verse, the bass pedal changes to C major, changes back to F during the chorus, and back to D minor during the chorus closure. This process is {{repeated}} during the second verse and chorus, which abruptly ends in a silence, with only the low <b>and</b> <b>lifeless</b> sound of the synthesizer, set in D minor. Madonna then starts to sing the bridge (or middle part)— [...] "If I ran away, I'd never have the strength"— between the tonal keys of D and F, closing with the repetition of the chorus until the song gradually fades out. The original composition of the song {{did not have the}} background synths, instead Leonard created a basic structure on piano, and Madonna added the words on top of it. According to Leonard, Madonna came up with the bridge by herself, extending it from the music that he was playing.|$|E
500|$|Most reviewers {{praised the}} writing and voice {{acting in the}} game. Entertainment Weekly Dan Stapleton of PC Gamer was able to predict many of the plot twists within Portal 2 story but [...] "still looked forward to {{witnessing}} exactly how the characters would react"; he praised {{the development of the}} characters, as [...] "their charm makes what would otherwise be an empty <b>and</b> <b>lifeless</b> world feel boisterous and alive". The characters were well received. Oynett wrote that Merchant's [...] "obvious enthusiasm for the role benefits the game" [...] and that the [...] "consistently clever writing perfectly complements the onscreen action". Game Informer Adam Biessener considered Johnson to be an even better character than GLaDOS, and praised the game's [...] "pitch-perfect delivery" [...] and [...] "brilliant comedic timing". In contrast, Peter Bright of Ars Technica wrote that compared to the loneliness and despair he felt while playing the first game, the characters, Wheatley and GLaDOS, lost some of this feeling and [...] "the inane babble served only to disrupt the mood".|$|E
500|$|... "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from music critics. Alexis Petridis from The Guardian noted that [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] bears {{the influence of}} early 1990s Europop and [...] "is the first song {{in a long time}} that warrants comparison to the œuvre of Ace of Base. Matthew Chisling of AllMusic gave a negative review of the song saying [...] "The Fame has it's 'ballad,' however the breezy 'Eh, Eh' doesn't hold water on this album; rather, it feels dry <b>and</b> <b>lifeless,</b> something which holds this album back". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that [...] "the breezy island vibe and soft demeanor of 'Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)' is hard to buy when sandwiched between songs like 'Poker Face' and 'Beautiful, Dirty, Rich.'" [...] In another article analysing about the music videos released by Gaga, Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine noted that [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] as a track [...] "is an intriguing case: rather than the tech-assisted sexy-androgynous dance pop that dominates a good chunk of The Fame, it and its sister tracks 'Brown Eyes' and 'Again Again' are evidence of a stripped-down, simpler, sincere Gaga.|$|E

500|$|In Lightning Returns, Juba criticized Lightning's lack of {{personal}} growth during the narrative, and IGN's Marty Silva felt that her increased coldness makes her [...] "downright unlikable." [...] VanOrd argued that Lightning is not [...] "interesting {{in and of}} herself" [...] {{and that she had}} turned into [...] "a vessel for holding and pouring plot devices", whose stoicism makes it difficult for the player to connect with her. Parrish, writing for USGamer, stated that Lightning had become [...] "downright apathetic", showing [...] "no personality whatsoever", and that this clashed with the ability to dress her in costumes. By contrast, Parkin commented that certain side quests, such as herding sheep or retrieving a girl's doll, helped to humanize Lightning and make her likable. Similarly, Destructoid's Dale North found that the costumes and dialogue lighten her character: he argued that these elements make her less [...] "flat <b>and</b> <b>lifeless</b> now, which is a big improvement." [...] Dave Riley of Anime News Network felt that Lightning's stoic attitude, although out of place in XIII and XIII-2, fit her role as a god's servant in Lightning Returns. Tech Reviewer, in a feature about the portrayal of female characters in video games, was impressed with the character's depth and portrayal.|$|E
500|$|Janet Di Lauro of Soap Opera Weekly commended Maria Arena Bell's {{change to}} Cane's backstory, saying: [...] "This story also {{breathes}} {{new life into}} Cane, who was becoming increasingly dull as a whitewashed, pompous do-gooder. Suddenly, he has his edge back." [...] Soap Opera Digest gave the storyline a thumbs up and a thumbs down because, though it was an exciting twist, it happened too closely to the other Chancellor family rewrite undoing the mother and daughter relationship between Jill and Katherine. The magazine later named the storyline the [...] "Most Preposterous Plot Twist" [...] of 2009 because the rewrite [...] "was way {{out of sync with}} Ys usual authentic approach to storytelling". In 2011, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News said that Goddard is [...] "forever second guessing his character when asked about Cane by the media", also stating that, [...] "To keep an edgy Cane, never to make him boring <b>and</b> <b>lifeless.</b> That’s why Cane is forever keeping secrets from his wife Lily and step mom Jill." [...] Garrett added that he was [...] "interested to see what Maria Bell's plan is" [...] to keep the character edgy, and that Goddard's performance is [...] "always dependable, on fire and exciting". In 2013, another writer from Canyon News, LaDale Anderson, commented that it was difficult for Lily to resist attraction to Tyler Michaelson (Redaric Williams), saying that [...] "trouble in paradise is brewing".|$|E
2500|$|Nitrogen is used under high {{pressure}} when dispensing dry stouts (such as Guinness) and other creamy beers because it displaces CO2 to (artificially) form a rich tight {{head and a}} less carbonated taste. This makes the beer feel smooth on the palate and gives a foamy appearance. [...] Premixed bottled gas for creamy beers is usually 75% nitrogen and 25% CO2. [...] This premixed gas which only works well with creamy beers {{is often referred to}} as Guinness Gas, Beer Gas, or Aligal. [...] Using [...] "Beer Gas" [...] with other beer styles can cause the last 5% to 10% of the beer in each keg to taste very flat <b>and</b> <b>lifeless.</b> [...] In the UK, the term keg beer would imply the beer is pasteurised, in contrast to unpasteurised cask ale. Some of the newer microbreweries may offer a nitro keg stout which is filtered but not pasteurized.|$|E
