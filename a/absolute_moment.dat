60|$|I {{believe there}} is no period of life so happy as that in which a {{thriving}} lover leaves his mistress after his first success. His joy is more perfect then than at the <b>absolute</b> <b>moment</b> of his own eager vow, and her half-assenting blushes. Then he is thinking mostly of her, and is {{to a certain degree}} embarrassed by the effort necessary for success. But when the promise has once been given to him, and he is able to escape into the domain of his own heart, he is as a conqueror who has mastered half a continent by his own strategy.|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} morning the whole household was up and dressed very early. Lady Fitzgerald--the poor lady made many futile attempts to drop her title, but hitherto without any shadow of success--Lady Fitzgerald was down in the breakfast parlour at seven, as also were Aunt Letty, and Mary, and Emmeline. Herbert had begged his mother not to allow herself to be disturbed, alleging {{that there was no}} cause, seeing that they all so soon would meet in London; but she was determined that she would superintend his last meal at Castle Richmond. The servants brought in the trays with melancholy silence, and now that the <b>absolute</b> <b>moment</b> of parting had come the girls could not speak lest the tears should come and choke them. It was not that they were about to part with him; that parting would only be for a month. But he was now about to part from all that ought to have been his own. He {{sat down at the table}} in his accustomed place, with a forced smile on his face, but without a word, and his sisters put before him his cup of tea, and the slice of ham that had been cut for him, and his portion of bread. That he was making an effort they all saw. He bowed his head down over the tea to sip it and took the knife in his hand, and then he looked up at them, for he knew that their eyes were on him; he looked up at them to show that he could still endure it. But, alas! he could not endure it. The struggle was too much for him; he pushed his plate violently from him into the middle of the table, and dropping his head upon his hands he burst forth into audible lamentations.|$|E

Would it be in my bosom to make her come and live with a stupid, silly old man, to potter on {{from day to day}} without any excitement? Would I force her into a groove in which her days would be wretched to her? Had she come to me and wanted bread, and have seen before her all the misery of poverty, the stone-coldness of a governess's life; had she been left to earn her bread without any one to love her, it might then have been different. She would have looked out into another world, and have seen another prospect. A {{comfortable}} home with kindness, and her needs supplied, would have sufficed. She would then have thought herself happy in becoming my wife. There would then have been no cruelty. But she had seen you, and though it was but a dream, she thought that she could endure to wait. Better that than surrender all the delight of loving. So {{she told me that she}} would think of you. Poor dear! I can understand now the struggle which she intended to make. Then in the very nick of time, in the <b>absolute</b> <b>moment</b> of the day--so that you might have everything and I nothing--you came. You came, and were allowed to see her, and told her all your story. You filled her heart full with joy, but only to be crushed when she thought that the fatal promise had been given to me. I saw it all, I knew it. I thought to myself for a few hours that it might be so. But it cannot be so." ...|$|E

40|$|The first <b>absolute</b> central <b>moment</b> is a {{statistical}} filter which measures {{the variability of}} the gray levels of the image {{with respect to the}} local mean. The analysis of the responses of the central and <b>absolute</b> central <b>moments</b> at noiseless isolated step discontinuities shows how the first <b>absolute</b> central <b>moment</b> can be usefully used to enhance these discontinuities. Moreover, experimental results show how a non-standard form of the <b>absolute</b> central <b>moment</b> should be used to enhance other image key points. At noiseless step discontinuities, the first <b>absolute</b> central <b>moment</b> provides a ridge map similar to the one provided by the GoG magnitude. However, unlike the GoG magnitude, a non-standard form of the first <b>absolute</b> central <b>moment</b> provides ridges at both edges and lines (pulse functions one pixel wide) and gives rise to local extrema of the ridges at line endings, corners, and intersections among different discontinuities. The analysis of the filter output in the presence of additive noise also shows that a generalized form of the first <b>absolute</b> central <b>moment</b> should be used to cope with noise properly. Both theoretical and experimental results show that, if right configurations of the generalized first <b>absolute</b> central <b>moment</b> are used, the filter retains most of its properties when real images are considered. Moreover, since the generalization of the original filter gives rise to a class of nonlinear filters, then the recovered edge information can be also usefully combined and two examples are illustrated in this paper. The first one shows how the zero-crossing map of an equivalent DoG filter can be obtained, whereas the second one shows how to obtain a local thresholding procedure. 1...|$|R

We apply our bound to study the rate distortion function under distortion measure |x − x|^r for sources that follow a log-concave probability distribution. In particular, we establish that the difference between the rate distortion function and the Shannon lower bound is at most log(√ 2 e) ≈ 1. 9 bits, independently of r and the target distortion d. For mean-square error distortion, the difference is at most log √πe ≈ 1. 55 bits, regardless of d. Our results generalize to the case of vector X.
