Red gas is usually avoided unless the airsoft gun has undergone modification, as its relatively high critical pressure can cause damage to the airsoft gun, such as breakage of the slide or bolt.

5000|$|The {{most serious}} {{inhalant}} abuse occurs among children and teens who [...] "... {{live on the}} streets completely without family ties."

The effects of inhalants range from an alcohol-like intoxication and intense euphoria to vivid hallucinations, depending on the substance and the dosage. Some inhalant users are injured due to {{the harmful effects of}} the solvents or gases, or due to other chemicals used in the products that they are inhaling. As with any recreational drug, users can be injured due to dangerous behavior while they are intoxicated, such as driving under the influence. Computer cleaning dusters are dangerous to inhale, because the gases expand and cool rapidly upon being sprayed. In some cases, users have died from hypoxia (lack of oxygen), pneumonia, cardiac failure or arrest, or aspiration of vomit.|$|E

R-12 was a commonly used refrigerant for car air conditioning and refrigerators, and is considered a highly potent ozone-depleting substance and listed as a Class I Ozone Depleting Substance by the US EPA. Its use as a general purpose <b>aerosol</b> <b>propellant</b> has been banned by the US EPA since March 1978 under 43 FR 11301 for use in aerosol use with a very few exceptions.

It would not harm the product it was cleaning, ignite with a spark or react with other chemicals.http://www.ciesin.org/TG?OZ/prodcfcs.htmlCFC-113 in laboratory analytics has been replaced by other solvents.|$|E
50|$|Inhalant users inhale vapors or <b>aerosol</b> <b>propellant</b> gases using {{plastic bags}} held over the mouth or by {{breathing}} {{from an open}} container of solvents, such as gasoline or paint thinner. Nitrous oxide gases from whipped cream aerosol cans, aerosol hairspray or non-stick frying spray are sprayed into plastic bags. Some nitrous oxide users spray the gas into balloons. When inhaling non-stick cooking spray or other aerosol products, some users may filter the aerosolized particles out with a rag. Some gases, such as propane and butane gases, are inhaled directly from the canister. Once these solvents or gases are inhaled, the extensive capillary surface of the lungs rapidly absorb the solvent or gas, and blood levels peak rapidly. The intoxication effects occur so quickly {{that the effects of}} inhalation can resemble the intensity of effects produced by intravenous injection of other psychoactive drugs. Some harm reduction experts encourage glue sniffers to use paper bags rather than thin plastic bags, because plastic bags greatly increase the risk of suffocation, as plastic bags are more likely to stick to the users' nose and mouth while she or he is intoxicated.|$|E
