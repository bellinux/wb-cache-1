2500|$|Patrick Matthew {{was born}} 20 October 1790 at Rome, a farm held {{by his father}} John Matthew near Scone Palace, in Perthshire. His mother was Agnes Duncan, a {{relative}} of Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan. He was educated at Perth Academy and the University of Edinburgh, but did not graduate, as on his father's death and while only seventeen, {{he had to take}} over the responsibilities of managing and running the affairs of a somewhat modest but significant property estate at Gourdiehill in the Carse of Gowrie, between Perth and Dundee. Over the years he successfully nurtured, cultivated, and transformed much of the estate's farmland and pastures into several large orchards of <b>apple</b> <b>and</b> <b>pear</b> <b>trees,</b> numbering over 10,000. [...] He became an avid proponent as well as interested researcher of both silviculture and horticulture, both of which influenced his growing awareness of the forces of nature. [...] This awareness, along with his own experiences acquired from years of working his own modest estate would later frame a strong base of reference to form his own opinions and theories.|$|E
50|$|In 1931 the Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers had a outing to Riccarton Moss and Haining Place and {{commented on}} the ancient mansion-house of Haining which they {{considered}} as having once been much larger with its thick walls and 'springs of arches at {{different parts of the}} outside walls'. Several acres of <b>apples</b> <b>and</b> <b>pear</b> <b>trees</b> had existed around the 'Place' until recent times, however most had been cut down recently because of their age and lack of productivity. The 'Gipsy Steps' is the name given to the track that leads down to the ford and stepping stones across the Cessnock Water.|$|R

60|$|The Wegg {{homestead}} {{stood near}} the edge of a thin forest of pines through which Little Bill Creek wound noisily {{on its way to the}} lake. At the left was a slope on which grew a neglected orchard of <b>apple</b> <b>and</b> <b>pear</b> <b>trees,</b> their trunks rough and gnarled by the struggle to outlive many severe winters. There was a rude, rocky lane in front, separated from the yard by a fence of split pine rails, but the ground surrounding the house was rich enough to grow a profusion of June grass.|$|E
60|$|One door, however, in {{the side}} of the guest-chamber had steps down to an orchard, full of <b>apple</b> <b>and</b> <b>pear</b> <b>trees</b> in their glory of pink bud and white blossom, borders of roses, gillyflowers, and lilies of the valley running along under the grey walls. There was a broad space of grass near the houses, whence could be seen the Round Tower of the Castle looking down in protection, while the {{background}} of the view was filled up with a mass of the foliage of Windsor forest, in the spring tints.|$|E
60|$|Still, {{the servant}} remembered {{his promise to}} his {{travelling}} comrade, and said never a word or asked never a question, though all that day he walked {{on the other side}} of the road, and would have nothing to say or to do with the other. But never a whit did his comrade seem to think of or to care for that. On they jogged, and, by the time evening was at hand, they had come to a neat cottage with <b>apple</b> <b>and</b> <b>pear</b> <b>trees</b> around it, all as pleasant as the eye could desire to see. In this cottage lived a widow and her only son, and they also made the travellers welcome, and set before them a good supper and showed them to a clean bed.|$|E

60|$|The {{invitation}} {{offered an}} agreeable distraction to Maggie's grief, and her tears gradually subsided as she trotted along by Luke's side to his pleasant cottage, which stood with its <b>apple</b> <b>and</b> <b>pear</b> <b>trees,</b> {{and with the}} added dignity of a lean-to pigsty, {{at the other end}} of the Mill fields. Mrs. Moggs, Luke's wife, was a decidedly agreeable acquaintance. She exhibited her hospitality in bread and treacle, and possessed various works of art. Maggie actually forgot that she had any special cause of sadness this morning, as she stood on a chair to look at a remarkable series of pictures representing the Prodigal Son in the costume of Sir Charles Grandison, except that, as might have been expected from his defective moral character, he had not, like that accomplished hero, the taste and strength of mind to dispense with a wig. But the indefinable weight the dead rabbits had left on her mind caused her to feel more than usual pity for the career of this weak young man, particularly when she looked at the picture where he leaned against a tree with a flaccid appearance, his knee-breeches unbuttoned and his wig awry, while the swine apparently of some foreign breed, seemed to insult him by their good spirits over their feast of husks.|$|E
60|$|The nearest {{object of}} {{consequence}} was a farmhouse, or, it might be, the abode {{of a small}} proprietor, situated {{on the side of}} a sunny bank which was covered by <b>apple</b> <b>and</b> <b>pear</b> <b>trees.</b> At the foot of the path which led up to this modest mansion was a small cottage, pretty much in the situation of a porter's lodge, though obviously not designed for such a purpose. The hut seemed comfortable, and more neatly arranged than is usual in Scotland. It had its little garden, where some fruit-trees and bushes were mingled with kitchen herbs; a cow and six sheep fed in a paddock hard by; the cock strutted and crowed, and summoned his family around him before the door; a heap of brushwood and turf, neatly made up, indicated that the winter fuel was provided; and the thin blue smoke which ascended from the straw-bound chimney, and winded slowly out from among the green trees, showed that the evening meal was in the act of being made ready. To complete the little scene of rural peace and comfort, a girl of about five years old was fetching water in a pitcher from a beautiful fountain of the purest transparency, which bubbled up at the root of a decayed old oak-tree about twenty yards from the end of the cottage.|$|E

40|$|Plants exhibit dependences between shoot {{growth and}} {{branching}} that generate highly structured patterns. The {{characterization of the}} patterning mechanism is still an open issue because of the developmental processes involved with both succession of events (e. g. internode elongation, axillary shoot initiation and elongation) and complex dependences among neighbouring positions along the parent shoot. Statistical models called semi-Markov switching partitioned conditional generalized linear models were built {{on the basis of}} <b>apple</b> <b>and</b> <b>pear</b> <b>tree</b> datasets. In these models, the semi-Markov chain represents both the succession and lengths of branching zones, whereas the partitioned conditional generalized linear models represent the influence of parent shoot growth variables on axillary productions within each branching zone. Parent shoot growth variables were shown to influence specific developmental events. On this basis, the growth and branching patterns of two apple tree (Malus domestica) cultivars, as well as of <b>pear</b> <b>trees</b> (Pyrus spinosa) between two successive growing cycles, were compared. The proposed integrative statistical models were able to decipher the roles of successive developmental events in the growth and branching patterning mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract We {{evaluated}} three {{approaches for}} sched-uling irrigation in wine grape vineyards <b>and</b> in olive, <b>apple</b> <b>and</b> Asian <b>pear</b> <b>tree</b> orchards, based on sap flow measurements and models of plant transpiration. In the first approach, we analysed how {{the shape of}} the sap-flow profile changed in response to root-zone soil water conditions and potential evaporative demand. The second approach was based on a transpiration ratio, as defined from the actual daily water use of a target plant divided by the potential daily water use of similar-sized plants under non-limiting soil water conditions (“well-irrigated ” plants). Values of the actual plant water use were always determined from measured sap flow. Two independent methods were assessed for the calculation of potential plant wate...|$|R
