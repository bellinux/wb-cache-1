40|$|A 5 MHz {{commercial}} sector scanner {{was used to}} monitor 13 muskox pregnancies and establish normal fetal growth curves. Examinations were carried out between 40 and 197 days of gestation and pregnancy could be detected throughout the period. Early pregnancies were found by scanning lateral to the udder but as pregnancy progressed the fetus was found closer to the dam's umbilicus. Measurements of cranial and abdominal diameters taken at <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>week</b> intervals in seven uncomplicated pregnancies in four cows were used to construct fetal growth curves. These can be reliably used in the reproductive management of muskoxen. In addition a series of regressions based on measurements of the fetuses of muskoxen killed in the Arctic are provided. These allow cranial and abdominal diameters {{to be related to}} fetal weight and crown-rump length...|$|R
