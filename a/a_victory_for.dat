5|$|Gerard {{agreed to}} a {{compromise}} {{on the matter of}} obedience to Anselm. King Henry proposed that Anselm accept a witnessed oath from Gerard that he would remain bound by the profession he made to Anselm on his consecration as Bishop of Hereford. Gerard made this oath at the Council of Westminster in 1107. It was <b>a</b> <b>victory</b> <b>for</b> Canterbury, but not a complete one, as Gerard avoided making a written profession, and it was specific to Gerard, not to his office. Gerard continued to oppose Anselm's attempts to assert Canterbury's primacy, but the two were reconciled before Gerard's death.|$|E

5|$|Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, but {{continued}} to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee {{to do the same}} in Harper's Ferry, and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by George Meade, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign, which was <b>a</b> <b>victory</b> <b>for</b> the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.|$|E
5|$|In February 1952, Baxter became deputy-director of the university. He {{defeated}} Arthur Denning in {{an election}} for director in December, assuming the position on 1 January 1953. As Denning had argued for the retention of the university's links with the Public Service Board, it was widely seen as <b>a</b> <b>victory</b> <b>for</b> the proponents of autonomy, but with his industrial background Baxter had {{little in common with}} the professors who came from academia, and did not share their views on the role and organisation of a university. The university did receive autonomy on 1 July 1954, and when traditional university titles were adopted in 1955, Baxter became vice-chancellor.|$|E

5|$|Leo's {{election}} {{was seen as}} <b>a</b> <b>victory</b> <b>for</b> France, with supporters of the French celebrating in Rome's streets upon his election.

He caught a cold while appearing in public, and died on 27 April 1605, twenty-six days after his election.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{pleased by}} the findings, the Eisenhower {{administration}} proposed negotiations on a permanent test ban and announced it would self-impose a year-long testing moratorium if Britain and the Soviet Union did the same. This decision amounted to <b>a</b> <b>victory</b> <b>for</b> John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles (then the Director of Central Intelligence), and PSAC, who had argued within the Eisenhower administration for separating a test ban from larger disarmament efforts, and a defeat for the Department of Defense and AEC, which had argued to the contrary.|$|E
