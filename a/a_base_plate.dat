25|$|In November 1958, Meccano Ltd {{introduced}} the Dublo Dinky range of models in 1:76 OO scale, {{designed to be}} used with the Hornby railway system (Force 1988, pp.165–166). These were relatively cheap to produce – having a one-piece die-cast metal body, <b>a</b> <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> and or windows on some, and plastic wheels. There was the added bonus of being able to compete in the small-scale toy car market which, at the time was dominated by Lesney's Matchbox (see Force 1988, p.47).|$|E
25|$|The bomb had {{a body of}} {{drawn steel}} to which a heavy pointed nose cone was welded. At the other end was <b>a</b> <b>base</b> <b>plate,</b> just forward of which the {{magnesium}} alloy tail was tack welded onto the body, and also bolted to the tail attachment brace. Around {{the nose of the}} bomb was a kopfring - a metal ring, triangular in cross section, designed to prevent ground penetration or to stop forward momentum when hitting water. The bomb was attached to the aircraft horizontally by a H-type suspension lug.|$|E

40|$|The press (10) has <b>a</b> fixed <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> (1) and <b>a</b> second {{parallel}} <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> (2), {{which is}} borne {{on at least}} one linear device (6) and which moves parallel to the fixed <b>base</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>base</b> <b>plates</b> hold several removable workpiece holders (3, 4) to removably press or clamp individual component groups (5) of a furniture frame. A control and evaluation device, is connected to at least one press pressure limiter. The press is pivotally positioned on <b>a</b> <b>base</b> frame (9) about a pivot axis (8), and has a pivot drive (7).

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{represents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} transient heat transfer on <b>a</b> solid <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> (mimic to skin) covered by fire retardant fabric (Kevlar® 49), under hot air jet impingement. The study {{was carried out by}} a fabricated attachment with an axial flow wind tunnel for horizontal hot air jet impingement. The hot air jet was impinged on <b>a</b> vertical <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> at different velocities and temperatures. A set of experimental conditions was considered to understand the various heat transfer phenomenon. The hot air jet temperatures were 115 and 125 °C respectively and jet velocities were 12, 15, and 19 ms− 1 respectively at the exit point of the nozzle. The surface temperatures of the solid <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> are used to calculate the heat flux, local heat transfer coefficient, and Nusselt numbers. The maximum heat transfer is found on <b>base</b> <b>plate,</b> whilst the maximum decrease of heat flux is observed on fire retardant fabric. This experimental model can enhance the understanding and insights of the heat transfer process through permeable fabric...|$|R

50|$|Most modern mortar systems {{consist of}} three main {{components:}} a barrel, <b>a</b> <b>base</b> <b>plate,</b> and a bipod. Modern mortars normally range in calibre from 60 mm (2.36 in) to 120 mm (4.72 in). However, mortars both larger and smaller than these specifications have been produced. An {{example of the}} smaller scale is the British 51 mm light mortar, which is carried by an individual and consists of only a tube and <b>a</b> <b>base</b> <b>plate.</b> Conversely, a large example is the Soviet 2S4 M1975 Tyulpan (tulip flower) 240 mm self-propelled mortar.|$|E
50|$|The barrel {{was mounted}} on a central pivot {{attached}} to <b>a</b> <b>base</b> <b>plate,</b> apparently with 360° of traverse. A single cylinder of compressed air was good for twelve shots.|$|E
