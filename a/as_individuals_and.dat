5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection <b>as</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> as species. He argues that the latter form of protection is motivated {{by a desire to}} preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing visions of the value of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species advocacy can limit the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E

Team Canada held leads of 3–1 and 4–2, but the Soviet side responded and the game ended in a 4–4 tie.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate {{government}} {{also tried to}} raise revenue through unorthodox means. Early on (in {{the first half of}} 1861), when the support for the separation from the Union and the military effort was running strong, the donation of coins and gold to the government accounted for about 35% of all sources of government funds. This source, however, dried up over time <b>as</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> institutions in the South both ran down their personal holdings of bullion and became more unwilling to make donations as war-weariness set in. As a consequence, by the summer of 1862, the share of government revenue coming from these donations fell to less than 1%. Over the course of the entire war this source of revenue contributed only 0.2% of total wartime expenditure.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} Armenian to visit North America was Martin the Armenian from Iran. He was an Iranian Armenian tobacco grower who settled in Jamestown, Virginia in 1618. In 1653–54, two Armenians from Constantinople {{were invited to}} Virginia to raise silk worms. A few other Armenians are recorded as having come to the US in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries, but most moved <b>as</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> did not establish communities. By the 1770s over 70 Armenians had settled in the colonies. The persecution of Christian minorities under the Ottoman Empire and American missionary activities resulted in a small wave of Armenian migration to the US in the 1830s from Cilicia and Western Armenia. Hatchik (Christopher) Oscanyan, a Constantinople American missionary school student, arrived in America in 1835 to pursue higher education. He later worked for the New York Herald Tribune and became the New York Press Club president. Many Armenians followed him and went to the US for education.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the level of}} knowledge of dentists of the ethical and legal aspects of exercising their profession <b>as</b> <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> corporate entities; to observe the level of knowledge of professionals on the main taxes inherent to their existence <b>as</b> <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> corporate entities; and to highlight {{the positive and negative}} aspects of each entity. Methods: A questionnaire was prepared containing structured and open questions, which was sent to dentists working in the cities of Betim and Contagem (Belo Horizonte metropolitan area) in letters containing self-addressed stamped envelopes for return to the research team. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: 77. 9 % of professionals work <b>as</b> <b>individual</b> entities, 19. 7 % <b>as</b> <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> corporate entities, and only 2. 5 % act solely as corporate entities. Of the professionals who work as corporate entities, 88. 8 % reported that the reason that led them to act <b>as</b> <b>individual</b> and/or corporate entities was a requirement by health plans. With regard to taxes imposed on each type of entity, 67. 4 % of individual entity professionals declared not knowing the main taxes related to their profession. Conclusions: The level of knowledge of dentists regarding the ethical and legal implications of performing their profession <b>as</b> <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> corporate entities is insufficient; the interviewed professionals are not properly trained on the pertinent ethical and legal aspects of their profession, thus becoming vulnerable to litigation; and these professionals do not have knowledge on the main taxes related to each type of legal entity...|$|R

25|$|Spock {{advocated}} {{ideas about}} parenting that were, at the time, considered {{out of the}} mainstream. Over time, his books helped to bring about major change. Previously, experts had told parents that babies needed to learn to sleep on a regular schedule, and that picking them up and holding them whenever they cried would only teach them to cry more and not to {{sleep through the night}} (a notion that borrows from behaviorism). They were told to feed their children on a regular schedule, and that they should not pick them up, kiss them, or hug them, because that would not prepare them to be strong and independent individuals in a harsh world. In contrast Spock encouraged parents to see their children <b>as</b> <b>individuals,</b> <b>and</b> not to apply a one-size-fits all philosophy to them.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Janus and Vesta {{touches on the}} question of the nature and function of the gods of beginning and ending in Indo-European religion. While Janus has the first place Vesta has the last, both in theology and in ritual (Ianus primus, Vesta extrema). The last place implies a direct connexion with the situation of the worshipper, in space and in time. Vesta is thence the goddess of the hearth of homes as well as of the city. Her inextinguishable fire is a means for men (<b>as</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> as a community) to keep in touch with the realm of gods. Thus there is a reciprocal link between the god of beginnings and unending motion, who bestows life to the beings of this world (Cerus Manus) as well as presiding over its end, and the goddess of the hearth of man, which symbolises through fire the presence of life. Vesta is a virgin goddess but at the same time she is considered the mother of Rome: she is thought to be indispensable to the existence and survival of the community.|$|E
