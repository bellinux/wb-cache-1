5|$|Cannon: The {{earliest}} known {{depiction of}} a cannon is a sculpture from the Dazu Rock Carvings in Sichuan dated to 1128, however the earliest archaeological samples and textual accounts do not appear until the 13th century. The primary extant specimens of cannon from the 13th century are the Wuwei Bronze Cannon dated to 1227, the Heilongjiang hand cannon dated to 1288, and the Xanadu Gun dated to 1298. However, only the Xanadu gun contains an inscription bearing a date of production, so it is considered the earliest confirmed extant cannon.

The {{monochrome}} head-up display offers a wide {{field of view}} {{and serves as a}} primary flight instrument; information is also displayed upon six color liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels. The primary flight controls are a force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of throttles. The USAF initially wanted to implement direct voice input (DVI) controls, but this was judged to be too technically risky and was abandoned. The canopy's dimensions are approximately 140inches long, 45inches wide, and 27inches tall (355cm x 115cm x 69cm) <b>and</b> <b>weighs</b> 360 pounds.|$|E

The average size of the egg is , <b>and</b> <b>weighs</b> , of which 6% is shell. The eggs are incubated for 12–15days, mainly by the female. The chicks are altricial and downy, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 14–16days after hatching. There are normally two broods, except in Siberia, where there is only one, the male feeding the fledglings from the first brood while the female sits on the second clutch. Sometimes the same nest is reused for both broods. The young are dependent on their parents for 15–20 days after fledging.|$|E

5|$|The figurine that {{is awarded}} to prize winners {{originated}} from a competition {{held by the}} local newspaper Haugesunds Avis in 1985, to create a sculpture of the legendary Amanda. The competition was won by Kristian Kvakland from Nesodden in Akershus. The full-size sculpture now stands outside the newspaper's office, but a miniature version was adopted as a trophy for the Amanda Award. The figurine is 30cm (11.81in) tall, with a skirt measuring 14cm (5.51in) in diameter. While the current sculpture is hollow <b>and</b> <b>weighs</b> 2.5kg (5.51lbs), {{for the first few}} years it was made of solid metal. Weighing in at 4.5kg (9.92lbs) it was difficult to hoist for many winners.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} (as {{represented}} by the nominate subspecies T. p. philomelos) is 20 to 23.5centimetres (8 to 9.25in) in length <b>and</b> <b>weighs</b> 50–107grammes (1.8 to 3.8oz). The sexes are similar, with plain brown backs and neatly black-spotted cream or yellow-buff underparts, becoming paler on the belly. The underwing is warm yellow, the bill is yellowish and the legs and feet are pink. The upperparts of this species become colder in tone from west to east across the breeding range from Sweden to Siberia. The juvenile resembles the adult, but has buff or orange streaks {{on the back and}} wing coverts.|$|E
5|$|A {{fiberglass}} Space Race cabinet {{was designed}} for the game by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. The tall, angular cabinet, reminiscent of the fiberglass cabinet for Computer Space, {{was the first to}} display the Atari logo. The cabinet design was distinctive enough that Bushnell considered using it for Pong as well, but the production costs proved too high and only 50 units were made before the design was dropped and Space Race switched to a more traditional rectangular cabinet. The final cabinet stands nearly 5 feet tall <b>and</b> <b>weighs</b> over 200 pounds. Bushnell later stated that the molds to make the fiberglass cabinets cost US$2000 and could only make one per day due to the complicated shape, and Atari felt the cost did not justify buying enough molds to make a full production run in a reasonable amount of time. The final Space Race cabinet was reused later that same year for Pong Doubles, a four-player version of Pong.|$|E

5|$|The common {{blackbird}} of the nominate subspecies T. m. merula is 23.5 to 29centimetres (9.25 to 11.4in) in length, {{has a long}} tail, <b>and</b> <b>weighs</b> 80–125grams (2.8 to 4.4oz). The {{adult male}} has glossy black plumage, blackish-brown legs, a yellow eye-ring and an orange-yellow bill. The bill darkens somewhat in winter. The adult female is sooty-brown with a dull yellowish-brownish bill, a brownish-white throat and some weak mottling on the breast. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, but has pale spots on the upperparts, and the very young juvenile also has a speckled breast. Young birds vary in the shade of brown, with darker birds presumably males. The first year male resembles the adult male, but has a dark bill and weaker eye ring, and its folded wing is brown, rather than black like the body plumage.|$|E
5|$|The {{smallest}} of the red robins, the red-capped robin is 10.5–12.5cm (4–5in) long with a wingspan of 15–19.5cm (6–8in), <b>and</b> <b>weighs</b> around 7–9g (0.25–0.31oz). Males and females are of similar size. It has longer legs than the other robins of the genus Petroica. The male has a distinctive scarlet cap and breast. Its upperparts are jet black with white shoulder bars, and its tail black with white tips. The underparts and shoulder are white. All colours are sharply delineated from one another. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown above with a reddish tint to the crown, and paler underneath with dark brown wings and pale buff wing patch. Some females have a reddish tint to the breast. Both sexes have a small black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. Immature birds initially resemble the female; it is only with their second moult, which takes place at around or {{just over a year}} of age that males adopt their distinctive adult plumage. The red-capped robin moults once a year, after the breeding season which takes place between December and April.|$|E
5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or thymine (T) — a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined {{to one another in}} a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 <b>and</b> <b>weighs</b> 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon (TtC).|$|E
