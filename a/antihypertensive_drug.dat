25|$|Reserpine (also {{known by}} trade names Raudixin, Serpalan, Serpasil) is an indole alkaloid, antipsychotic, and <b>antihypertensive</b> <b>drug</b> {{that has been}} used for the control of high blood {{pressure}} and for the relief of psychotic symptoms, although because of the development of better drugs for these purposes and because of its numerous side-effects, it is rarely used today. The antihypertensive actions of reserpine are a result of its ability to deplete catecholamines (among other monoamine neurotransmitters) from peripheral sympathetic nerve endings. These substances are normally involved in controlling heart rate, force of cardiac contraction and peripheral vascular resistance.|$|E

40|$|Background. Yangxue Qingnao granule (YQG) {{combined}} with <b>antihypertensive</b> <b>drugs,</b> a new integrative medicine therapy, {{has been widely}} used for essential hypertension (EH) in China. This study aims to assess the current clinical evidence of YQG {{combined with}} <b>antihypertensive</b> <b>drugs</b> for EH. Methods. Randomized controlled trials(RCTs) published between 1996 and 2012 on YQG combined with <b>antihypertensive</b> <b>drugs</b> versus <b>antihypertensive</b> <b>drugs</b> in treating EH were retrieved from six major electronic databases, including The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Wanfang Data. Meta-analysis {{was performed on the}} overall effects on blood pressure. Results. Twelve randomized trials were included. Methodological quality of the trials was evaluated as generally low. Meta-analysis showed that YQG combined with <b>antihypertensive</b> <b>drugs</b> demonstrated potential effect for lowing either SBP (MD: − 7. 31 [− 11. 75, − 2. 87]; P= 0. 001) or DBP (MD: − 5. 21 [− 8. 19, − 2. 24]; P= 0. 0006) compared to <b>antihypertensive</b> <b>drugs</b> alone.

25|$|The {{production}} of nitric oxide is elevated in populations living at high altitudes, which helps these people avoid hypoxia by aiding in pulmonary vasculature vasodilation. Effects include vasodilatation, neurotransmission (see gasotransmitters), modulation {{of the hair}} cycle, {{production of}} reactive nitrogen intermediates and penile erections (through its ability to vasodilate). Nitroglycerin and amyl nitrite serve as vasodilators because they are converted to nitric oxide in the body. The vasodilating <b>antihypertensive</b> <b>drug</b> minoxidil contains an ·NO moiety and may act as an NO agonist. Likewise, Sildenafil citrate, popularly known by the trade name Viagra, stimulates erections primarily by enhancing signaling through the nitric oxide pathway in the penis.|$|E
