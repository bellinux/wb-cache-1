50|$|The {{story begins}} with Nina, a lesbian {{real estate agent}} who {{lives and works in}} the {{neighborhood}} and {{is at the center of}} the changes taking place. The changes include having areas of the neighborhood designated a Historic District (creating restrictive housing codes), an increase in code enforcement complaints, and efforts to reduce low-income housing in the community. Code enforcement is complaint driven and neighborhood resident Linda Mitchell believes the new residents moving in on her block are responsible for the code and zoning citations that have landed her in Judge Pfeiffer's Environmental Court. Linda suffers from cirrhosis of the liver and lives on disability insurance. She does not address the housing and zoning violations and her limited resources prevent her from making repairs to her home. This puts her in jeopardy of arrest, until residents assist in remedying with code violations. Baba, a Yoruba priest and plumber, is the founder of the community gallery in the neighborhood, which occupies the bottom two floors of his three-story house. The name and <b>address</b> <b>sign</b> that he hangs above his porch is now in violation of Historic Code because it is carved in an African-relief style. Baba is also prosecuted in court before Judge Pfeiffer and faces fines and possible arrest for refusing to remove his sign, but the case is dismissed. Jim, a working-class gay man, works two jobs to buy a boarded up Victorian house in Olde Towne East. He risks his financial future when he purchases and begins renovations on the house using credit cards.|$|E

40|$|Many {{state and}} local highway {{agencies}} currently have programs for inventorying and periodically inspecting their signs. Most inventories <b>address</b> <b>sign</b> type and location, and inspections focus on the physical condition of the sign and support system. Evaluations are rarely, if ever, done {{to determine if a}} sign is the correct one or if it is needed at all, or if a sign is absent at a location that requires one. This type of evaluation focuses on how well highways provide information a driver needs to safely navigate the road. In light of ever-increasing tort liability cases, as documented by Oliver {{in a recent issue of}} /TE Journal, this type of sign evaluation is equally as important as inventory and inspection. l This article describes the Simplified Location of Information Deficiencies (SLIDE) procedure whereby highway locations that have information deficiencies can be easily identified so that the need for corrective action can be evaluated. The SLIDE procedure is a simple field survey technique done within a vehicle and without the need for special equipment. It was one of the products of a research study on driver needs on two-Iane rural highways. ’ The procedure is oriented toward the two-lane rural road network. The variability in roadway characteristics on the rural road system creates numerous site-specific situations where there is an unmet need for warning andlor guidance information...|$|E

5000|$|RR {{is similar}} to MR, but uses neither {{diacritics}} nor apostrophes, which has helped it to gain widespread acceptance on the Internet.

40|$|Introduction: Measles is {{a highly}} {{infectious}} viral illness that {{remains one of the}} leading causes of death among children worldwide.
