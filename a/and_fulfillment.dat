40|$|Using {{a sample}} of post-retirement workers (N = 176), this study {{investigated}} the role of future time perspective (FTP) in psychological contracts. The study aimed to test: (i) whether future time perspective is related to employer psychological contract <b>fulfillment</b> <b>and</b> (ii) whether it moderates relations between psychological contract <b>fulfillment</b> <b>and</b> employee obligations. Based on previous work, three types of employer psychological contract fulfillment are examined: economic, socio-emotional, <b>and</b> developmental <b>fulfillment.</b> FTP was expected to relate positively to developmental fulfillment. Moreover, people with limited future time perspective were hypothesized to manifest a stronger relationship between economic <b>and</b> socio-emotional <b>fulfillment</b> <b>and</b> employee obligations. Results showed that future time perspective is indeed significantly related to developmental <b>fulfillment,</b> <b>and</b> also moderated the relations between contract <b>fulfillment</b> <b>and</b> employee obligations. More specifically, economic <b>and</b> socio-emotional <b>fulfillments</b> were significantly stronger related to obligations among older workers with high FTP. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The novella's protagonist is Hugh Wolfe, an iron mill laborer who possesses artistic talent and a spiritual desire for higher forms of pleasure <b>and</b> <b>fulfillment.</b> Despite the hopefulness of Wolfe’s artistic drive, he becomes the story's tragic hero, as his yearning for a better life leads to his imprisonment and ultimate death.|$|E
25|$|For Hegel, {{the inner}} {{movement}} of reality {{is the process}} of God thinking, as manifested {{in the evolution of the}} universe of nature and thought; that is, Hegel argued that, when fully and properly understood, reality is being thought by God as manifested in a person's comprehension of this process in and through philosophy. Since human thought is the image <b>and</b> <b>fulfillment</b> of God's thought, God is not ineffable (so incomprehensible as to be unutterable) but can be understood by an analysis of thought and reality. Just as humans continually correct their concepts of reality through a dialectical process, so God himself becomes more fully manifested through the dialectical process of becoming.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of Bate Tichenor's move to Mexico in 1953, she began what would become a {{lifetime}} journey through her art and mysticism, inspired by her belief in ancestral spirits, to achieve self-realization. While painting alone and in isolation, she removed her familiar and societal masks to find her own personal human and spiritual identities; she would then reposition those hidden identities with new masks and characters in her paintings that represented her own sacred beliefs and truths. This guarded internal process of self-discovery <b>and</b> <b>fulfillment</b> was allegorically portrayed with a cast of mythological characters engaged in magical settings. She painted a dramatization of her own life and quests on canvas through an expressive visual language and an artistic vocabulary that she kept secret.|$|E
25|$|Other thinkers soon {{offered more}} {{ideas on the}} roles that workers play in mature {{industrial}} systems. These included ideas on improvement of the individual worker with attention to the worker's needs, not just {{the needs of the}} whole. James Hartness published The Human Factor in Works Management in 1912, while Frank Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth offered their own alternatives to Taylorism. The human relations school of management evolved in the 1930s to complement rather than replace scientific management, with Taylorism determining the organisation of the work process, and human relations helping to adapt the workers to the new procedures. Today's efficiency-seeking methods, such as lean manufacturing, include respect for workers <b>and</b> <b>fulfillment</b> of their needs as integral parts of the theory. (Workers slogging their way through workdays in the business world do encounter flawed implementations of these methods that make jobs unpleasant; but these implementations generally lack managerial competence in matching theory to execution.) Clearly a syncretism has occurred since Taylor's day, although its implementation has been uneven, as lean management in capable hands has produced good results for both managers and workers, but in incompetent hands has damaged enterprises.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of Double Fine Adventure and other {{high-profile}} titles on Kickstarter, Big Finish decided to crowd source the additional funds needed to turn Project Fedora into a full-length 3D adventure game in the vein of the previous titles. They announced their intention to launch a Kickstarter campaign, and set the date for May 15. This iteration of Project Fedora was pitched to have live-action video cut-scenes, fully 3D environments, and multiple story paths. The fundraising goal was set at $450,000, to be supplemented by $300,000 supplied by Big Finish, for a proposed budget of $750,000 (minus fees <b>and</b> <b>fulfillment</b> costs). Within six days, it had surpassed half the funding needed. On June 7, eight days ahead of the deadline, it reached its minimal funding level of $450,000. As of the project's close on June 16, it had raised $598,104 on Kickstarter, and $14,385 in PayPal donations, {{for a total of}} $612,489, 36% over its goal, and continued to allow pledges and upgrades on their own site via PayPal, eventually raising $657,196 by the close of the fundraising campaign on July 31, 2013. Several additions to the game were announced for the extra funding, including expansions to the game's main hub, Chandler Avenue, an orchestral music score, and a playable golf simulator accessible in-game.|$|E
