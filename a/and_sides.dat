5|$|As an extratropical storm over Newfoundland, Florence {{produced}} powerful winds peaking at 101mph (163km/h) {{and moderate}} amounts of rainfall {{of up to}} 2.6inches (67mm). Flooding and power outages were reported, although they were isolated. The hurricane caused flight interruptions at St. John's International Airport and also to the Trans Canada ferry between Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island in eastern Nova Scotia. Strong winds destroyed {{a house in the}} small Newfoundland village of Francois. Residents in Francois agreed to rebuild the wrecked home while the family temporarily resided in a summer home of another family. The winds also caused damage to shingles <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> of homes, while the strong waves damaged roads and boats along the Burin Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|By the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves {{disappeared}} <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> {{were cut}} away and tightened. With {{the development of}} new clothing materials, particularly latex and nylon, through the 1930s swimsuits gradually began hugging the body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning. Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure. Coco Chanel made suntans fashionable, and in 1932 French designer Madeleine Vionnet offered an exposed midriff in an evening gown. They were seen a year later in Gold Diggers of 1933. The Busby Berkeley film Footlight Parade of 1932 showcases aquachoreography that featured bikinis. Dorothy Lamour's The Hurricane (1937) also showed two-piece bathing suits.|$|E
5|$|C. m. monedula (Linnaeus, 1758), the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{is found}} in eastern Europe. Its range extends across Scandinavia, from southern Finland south to Esbjerg and Haderslev in Denmark, through eastern Germany and Poland, and south across eastern central Europe to the Carpathian Mountains and north-western Romania, Vojvodina in northern Serbia, and Slovenia. It breeds in south-eastern Norway, southern Sweden, and northern and eastern Denmark, with occasional wintering in England and France. It has been recorded as a rare vagrant to Spain. It has a pale nape <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> of the neck, a dark throat, and a light grey partial collar of variable extent.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after waking, red pandas clean their fur {{somewhat}} {{like a cat}} would, licking their front paws and then rubbing their backs, torsos, <b>and</b> <b>sides.</b> They also rub their backs and bellies {{along the sides of}} trees or rocks. Then they patrol their territories, marking with urine and a weak musk-smelling secretion from their anal glands. They search for food running along the ground or through the trees. Red pandas may use their forepaws alternately to bring food to their mouths or place food directly into their mouths.|$|E
5|$|The Danube crested newt's back <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> {{are dark}} brown with black spots and white stippling. The belly is orange to red (in other crested newts, {{it is usually}} yellow or orange–yellow), with small or {{medium-sized}} black blotches that have sharp edges. Like all crested newts, T.dobrogicus males develop a crest on their back and tail during breeding phase, which can be quite high and jagged and usually starts between the eyes and nostrils. Another feature of males at breeding season is a bluish-white stripe along the tail.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} to have been {{protected}} with Krupp and Wotan, Hart ("Wotan", Hard) armor plating. The class decks were 20mm thick, with 35mm thick sloped deck. The conning tower had a roof that was 50mm thick <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> 100mm thick. The inner layer of the armor belt was 50mm thick in critical areas amidships, and tapered down to zero protection at the stern and bow. The outer layer was 30mm amidships; it too tapered down to nothing {{at both ends of}} the ships. The gun turrets had the same armor protection as the preceding light cruiser : the sides were 35mm thick, the faces were 80mm thick, the roofs ranged in thickness from 2035mm. The armor protecting the turret barbettes was 60mm thick.|$|E

5|$|This {{is a large}} duck, and the male's long central tail {{feathers}} {{give rise}} to the species' English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The drake is more striking, having a thin white stripe running {{from the back of}} its chocolate-coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage. The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back <b>and</b> <b>sides.</b> The hen's plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female dabbling ducks. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.|$|E
5|$|In 1869 {{the island}} was visited by a {{magistrate}} P. Cloete aboard the Thetis investigating a possible murder. He was accompanied by Charles Moore, director of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and his assistant William Carron who forwarded plant specimens to Ferdinand Mueller at the botanic gardens in Melbourne who, by 1875, had catalogued and published 195 species. Also on the ship was William Fitzgerald, a surveyor, and Mr Masters from the Australian Museum. Together they surveyed the island with the findings published in 1870 when the population was listed as 35 people, their 13 houses built of split palm battens thatched on the roof <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> with palm leaves. At about this time there began a downturn of trade with {{the demise of the}} whaling industry and sometimes six or twelve months passed without a vessel calling. With the provisions rotting in the storehouses the older families lost interest in market gardening.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Dawson {{had decided}} that the two French troops should take the lead into Ouistreham, {{followed}} by the six British troops. The French were unopposed apart from some mortar rounds and machine gun fire as they neared their objective. No. 8 French Troop occupied houses at the front <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> of the Casino strong point. An assault to capture the Casino was driven back. While {{this was going on}} the other French troop, No. 1, approached the Casino from the rear. Taking up firing positions they too started to engage the strong point but their fire had almost no effect. The French commander Capitaine de frégate Philippe Kieffer was just about to order an all out assault by both troops, when reports that British amphibious tanks were in Ouistreham reached him. Sending a guide to bring one forward, the tank arrived in front of the Casino and proceeded to destroy the German gun emplacements. Within 30 minutes of the tanks' arrival, all the strong point guns were silenced and No. 1Troop had assaulted and captured the objective. With its capture the French Commandos were now in control of the western suburbs of Ouistreham.|$|E

5|$|The trachea and bronchi {{form the}} tracheobronchial tree. The trachea is {{situated}} between {{the lower end}} of the larynx and the center of the chest, where it splits into the two bronchi at a ridge called the carina. The trachea is stabilized and kept open by rings made of cartilage that surround the front <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> of the structure; these rings are not closed and do not surround the back, which is made of membrane. The bronchi split into smaller branches and then to bronchioles that supply air to the alveoli, the tiny air-filled sacs in the lungs responsible for absorbing oxygen. An arbitrary division can be made between the intrathoracic and cervical trachea at the thoracic inlet, an opening at the top of the thoracic cavity. Anatomical structures that surround and protect the tracheobronchial tree include the lungs, the esophagus, large blood vessels, the rib cage, the thoracic spine, and the sternum. Children have softer tracheas and a more elastic tracheobronchial trees than adults; this elasticity, which helps protect the structures from injury when they are compressed, may contribute to the lower incidence of TBI in children.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, heat {{treatment}} {{was carried out}} in five different phenological phases, from the first node detectable (DEV 31) growth stage to 20 days after flowering, on four wheat genotypes with very different adaptation strategies. They were grown in a controlled environ - ment in a phytotron chamber and exposed to a night temperature of 20 ºC and a day tempera - ture of either 30 ºC, at DEV 31, or 35 ºC at all the later developmental phases, for an interval of 14 days. Plant height, leaf number, number of tillers, grain number and grain weight per main <b>and</b> <b>side</b> spikes, TKW per main <b>and</b> <b>side</b> spikes, length of the main <b>and</b> <b>side</b> spikes, <b>and</b> spikelet number per main <b>and</b> <b>side</b> spikes were recorded. High temperature enhanced the stem growth intensity, plant height and tiller number. In contrast, the length of side spikes, spikelet no. /side spike, grain no. /main <b>and</b> <b>side</b> spike, grain weight/main <b>and</b> <b>side</b> spike <b>and</b> TKW/main <b>and</b> <b>side</b> spike were significantly decreased. The stress response depended strongly on the develop- mental phase in which the heat stress was applied. Fleischmann 481 and Soissons showed defi- nitely contrasting tendencies both in grain number and grain weight. In the case of the Plains- man V and Mv Magma pair, the higher heat stress tolerance of Magma compared to Plainsman V was evident also from the grain number and weight of the main spike at each developmental phase...|$|R
