25|$|Since LCD panels produce {{no light}} of their own, they require {{external}} light to produce a visible image. In a transmissive type of LCD, this light is provided {{at the back of}} the glass stack and is called the backlight. While passive-matrix displays are usually not backlit (e.g. calculators, wristwatches), active-matrix displays almost <b>always</b> <b>are.</b> Over the last years (1990 - 2017), the LCD backlight technologies have strongly been emerged by lighting companies such as Philips, Lumileds (a Philips subsidiary) and more.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{in several}} European {{countries}} (e.g. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Switzerland), religious unions have existed for decades. These unions typically distanced themselves {{from some of}} the doctrines of orthodox Marxism, such as the preference of atheism and from rhetoric suggesting that employees' interests <b>always</b> <b>are</b> in conflict with those of employers. Some of these Christian unions have had some ties to centrist or conservative political movements and some do not regard strikes as acceptable political means for achieving employees' goals. In Poland, the biggest trade union Solidarity emerged as an anti-communist movement with religious nationalist overtones and today it supports the right-wing Law and Justice party.|$|E

25|$|The Government {{has stated}} publicly, {{including}} before the U.N. Committee on Human Rights in Geneva, that its {{policy is to}} protect the right of non-Muslims to worship privately. However, non-Muslim organizations have claimed that there are no explicit guidelines for distinguishing between public and private worship, such as the number of persons permitted to attend and the types of locations that are acceptable. Such lack of clarity, as well as instances of arbitrary enforcement by the authorities, obliges most non-Muslims to worship in such a manner as to avoid discovery. Those detained for non-Muslim worship almost <b>always</b> <b>are</b> deported by authorities after sometimes lengthy periods of arrest during investigation. In some cases, they also are sentenced to receive lashes prior to deportation.|$|E

[...] After discussing the crash with Dylan, biographer Robert Shelton concluded that he [...] "was saying there must be another way of life for the pop star, in which he is in control, not they. He had to find ways of working to his own advantage with the recording industry. He had to come to terms with his one-time friend, longtime manager, part-time neighbor, and sometime landlord, Albert Grossman." ...|$|E

Mary Lutyens, in editing the diary of her grandmother Edith (wife of Lord Lytton, Viceroy of India 1876–80), concluded, [...] "Though one can understand that the Munshi was disliked, as favourites nearly <b>always</b> <b>are...</b> One cannot help feeling that the repugnance with which he was regarded by the Household was based mostly on snobbery and colour prejudice." [...] Victoria biographer Elizabeth Longford wrote, [...] "Abdul Karim stirred once more that same royal imagination which had magnified the virtues of John Brown... Nevertheless, [...] insinuated into her confidence an inferior person, while it increased the nation's dizzy infatuation with an inferior dream, the dream of Colonial Empire." ...|$|E

In the book's foreword, Stephen Corry wrote: [...] "The 'development' of tribal peoples against their wishes – really to let others get {{their land and}} resources – is rooted in 19th century colonialism ('We know best') dressed up in 20th century 'political correct' euphemism. Tribal peoples are not backward: they are independent and vibrant societies which, {{like all of us}} <b>always,</b> <b>are</b> constantly adapting to a changing world.

2500|$|The Czech Republic is a source, transit, and {{destination}} country {{for women and}} children trafficked from Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Moldova, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, China, and Vietnam into and through the Czech Republic mainly {{for the purpose of}} sexual exploitation. Czech victims and those transiting the country are trafficked to Western Europe and the United States, sometimes via third countries. Internal trafficking occurs from low employment areas to Prague and regions bordering Germany and Austria. Ethnic Roma women are at the highest risk for internal trafficking, and almost <b>always</b> <b>are</b> trafficked by a relative or someone known to them previously.

2500|$|Commentators {{attributed}} the rivalry between {{the left and}} the right as an important factor in the controversy. The NAACP had passed a resolution asking the Tea Party to repudiate racist language among its members. Breitbart said he posted the videos in response. [...] Commentators from each side noted that racial issues were being manipulated for political gain. Imani Perry, a professor at Princeton's Center for African American Studies, said some conservatives manipulated white fears for political advantage:I think many white Americans are fearful that with Obama in the White House, and the diversity in his appointments, that the racial balance of power is shifting. And that's frightening both because people <b>always</b> <b>are</b> afraid to give up privilege, and because of the prospect of a black-and-brown backlash against a very ugly history. Some liberals have long maintained that racism requires power, and so black people can't be racist. Obama's election undercut the first argument and made the specter of black racism appear more threatening.|$|E

2500|$|Alice (née Alice Gibson), {{played in}} the first nine skits, {{starting}} in 1951, and ending in January 1952 by Pert Kelton, and by Audrey Meadows for all remaining episodes, is Ralph's patient but sharp-tongued wife of roughly 12 years. She often finds herself bearing the brunt of Ralph's insults, which she returns with biting sarcasm. She is levelheaded, in contrast to Ralph's pattern of inventing various schemes to enhance his wealth or his pride. In each case, she sees the current one's un-workability, but he becomes angry and ignores her advice (and {{by the end of the}} episode, her misgivings almost <b>always</b> <b>are</b> proven to have been well-founded).
