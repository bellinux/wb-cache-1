Isaac informs him that Manya had {{forgotten}} Jerry made the pony remark: [...] "Oh, no no no. She forgot <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> She was much more upset about the potato salad." [...] Elaine asks Isaac multiple times {{about what is going}} to happen with their apartment. Isaac eventually tells her that Jerry's cousin Jeffrey is going to live in it. When it starts to rain, Jerry realizes that the game will be postponed. The following day, after the game, Jerry, George and Elaine meet at Monk's Café, where they discuss the lousy way Jerry played softball. (Jerry recalls a certain play, about which he admits, [...] "It was the single worst moment of my life.") Elaine wonders if Manya's spirit put a spell on him.|$|E

[...] was recorded by the group {{on the street with}} a tape recorder. [...] "Fun" [...] has a hip hop groove, jazz fusion tone, and irreverent, party theme similar to [...] "Dance Hall". [...] "Anniversary" [...] is about mature, lasting love. Elysa Gardner of Vibe calls it [...] "a grandly romantic, nine-minute bolero that lavishes its female subject with such warmth and respect that the cheeky misogyny of [...] seems instantly forgiveable." [...] "Castleers" [...] is a short vocal track and tribute to Raphael and D'wayne's Castlemont High School chorus group, Castleers Choir, in which they sang as students. Raphael said of its inspiration, [...] "The high school choir was <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> classic R & B harmony, so I named the song after the choir. One {{of the great things about}} that experience at school was that it got us ready to go out in the professional world with our music." ...|$|E

500|$|Edward's {{youngest}} brother, Prince John, {{died at the}} age of 13 on 18 January 1919 after {{a severe}} seizure. John suffered from epilepsy, and Edward, who was 11 years older than his brother and had hardly known him, saw his death as [...] "little more than a regrettable nuisance". He wrote to his mistress of the time that [...] " [...] told [...] <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> little brother, and how he was an epileptic. 's been practically shut up for the last two years anyhow, so no one has ever seen him except the family, and then only once or twice a year. This poor boy had become more of an animal than anything else." [...] He also wrote an insensitive letter to Queen Mary, which has since been lost. She did not reply, but he felt compelled to write her an apology, in which he stated: [...] "I feel such a cold hearted and unsympathetic swine for writing all that I did... No one can realize more than you how little poor Johnnie meant to me who hardly knew him... I feel so much for you, darling Mama, who was his mother." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{calling the}} album Dream Theater, the band tried to define {{who they were}} and {{emphasize}} that they were moving forward. Reflecting on the decision for Guitar World, Petrucci said, [...] "We wanted to make this album a reference point for [...] {{as far as what}} Dream Theater is <b>all</b> <b>about.</b> <b>That</b> was the goal and the mission, and it {{set the tone for the}} entire project." [...] In an article for Grantland, Steven Hyden noted the album's stylistic similarities to Rush, writing, [...] "There are songs on Dream Theater that are just straight-up Rush imitations, most notably 'The Looking Glass,' which crossbreeds 'Limelight' with 'Freewill' while leaving out Neil Peart’s misanthropic individualism." ...|$|E

Of this show a {{critic for the}} New York Sun said [...] "He paints the humble domestic life that he knows with a frankness as to its happenings, a sympathy and a tireless eye for detail that command respect, if not enthusiasm. The curious may learn <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> life from his paintings without going {{to the trouble of}} doing settlement work or running the slightest risk of getting out of their class." [...] His shows at the Walker Gallery produced institutional sales to the Carnegie Institute, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Whitney Museum.|$|E

2500|$|In 1975, the Australian Broadcasting Commission invited Clark to {{give the}} 1976 Boyer Lectures, a series of lectures which were {{broadcast}} and later published as A Discovery of Australia. The Boyer lectures allowed Clark to describe many of the core ideas of his published work and indeed his own life in characteristic style. [...] "Everything a historian writes," [...] he stated for example, [...] "should be a celebration of life, a hymn of praise to life. It should come up from inside {{a man who knows}} <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> horror of the darkness when a man returns to the dust from whence he came, a man who has looked into the heart of that great darkness, but has both a tenderness for everyone, and yet, paradoxically, a melancholy, a sadness, and a compassion because what matters most in life is never likely to happen". Clark's next work, In Search of Henry Lawson (1979), was a reworking of an essay which was originally written in 1964 as a chapter for Geoffrey Dutton's pioneering The Literature of Australia. It was worked up in some haste in response to the desire of the Macmillan publishing house for a new book with which they could cash in on Clark's popularity. Predictably, and with more than usual justification, Clark saw Lawson as another of his tragic heroes, and he wrote with a good deal of empathy of Lawson's losing battle with alcoholism: a fate Clark himself had narrowly avoided by giving up drink in the 1960s. But the book showed both its age and its haste of preparation, and was savaged by Professor Colin Roderick, the leading authority on Lawson, as [...] "a tangled thicket of factual errors, speculation and ideological interpretation".|$|E
