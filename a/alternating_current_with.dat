50|$|A {{polyphase}} {{system is a}} means of distributing alternating-current electrical power. Polyphase systems have three or more energized electrical conductors carrying <b>alternating</b> <b>currents</b> <b>with</b> a definite time offset between the voltage waves in each conductor. Polyphase systems are particularly useful for transmitting power to electric motors. The most common example is the three-phase power system used for industrial applications and for power transmission. A major advantage of three phase power transmission (using three conductors, as opposed to a single phase power transmission, which uses two conductors), is that, since the remaining conductors act as the return path for any single conductor, the power transmitted by a balanced three phase system is three times that of a single phase transmission but only one extra conductor is used. Thus, a 50% / 1.5x increase in the transmission costs achieves a 200% / 3.0x increase in the power transmitted.|$|R

Ten kilovolt, three-phase <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> <b>with</b> a frequency of 50 hertz was transmitted over three overhead wires, strung one above the other.

50|$|Most {{electric}} systems use <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> <b>with</b> {{a nominal}} frequency of 50 or 60 Hz (hertz) to deliver energy produced by electrical generators to the electricity consumers. When {{the amount of}} electric power produced by the generators exceeds the power used by the customers, {{the frequency of the}} electricity rises. Conversely, when the amount of electric power produced is less than what is consumed, the frequency drops. Therefore frequency is an accurate indicator of the system-wide (called global) balance between supply and demand. Without grid-friendly frequency response, {{the rate at which the}} frequency changes is dependent principally on the system's total inertia (which is not very controllable) and the aggregate response of the generators' control systems (which can only be controlled relatively slowly). In contrast, grid-friendly devices can act very quickly.|$|E

40|$|Most of {{the current}} {{domestic}} installations are single phase, with contracted power equal to or less than 15 kW and with a potential difference of 230 V. When consumption {{is expected to be}} higher you choose to use three different <b>alternating</b> <b>currents</b> <b>with</b> a difference voltage of 400 V between them, which are called phases. This enables the subdivision of the installation in different single-phase circuits, fed independently with the neutral installation. These couples have, in turn, a difference in voltage of 230 V. The neutral is common for all three phases so that, if the system is balanced, no current flows through it. The problem with these installations is that they are designed to work in an offset manner, using phase loads, and simultaneously an equal amount of energy consumed by the three phases of the network. Connection to each of the phases makes independent single-phase loads or disturbance of the operation of the original phase circuit and, consequently, the corresponding increases in consumption, heating of engines, etc. Universidad de Málaga.

5000|$|Neuhof Substation is a 110 kV {{substation}} in Neuhof, {{an urban}} part of Bad Sachsa, Lower Saxony. The Neuhof substation went in service in 1985 and was {{connected with a}} 110 kV-powerline for three phase <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> <b>with</b> the Wolkramshausen substation in former East Germany. It was therefore {{one of the few}} substations in former West Germany, into which electricity from GDR was fed. Through the Neuhof substation up to 40 MVA could be imported. Up to 25 MVA of the imported power could be fed via 5 rotary motor-generators, which were manufactured by Siemens and used for the compensation of frequency fluctuations of the East German power grid, into the power grid of West Germany. Additionally power was fed directly from the East German power grid into the grids of Bad Sachsa, Walkenried, Zorge and Wieda. The converters consisted of a three-phase asynchronous motor with a short circuited rotor on the driving side and an asynchronous generator with a slip-ring fed rotor, whereby the frequency adjustment was made by a static frequency inverter, which feeds the rotor. Startup of a converter took place using the slip-ring rotor with a conventional starter circuit. After the converter had reached its nominal speed, the short circuited rotor was connected, which then took over the drive. In April 1990 the plant was shut down and between 2003 and 2005 the machines were dismantled. The machine halls stand still today and are used by Harzenergie for internal purposes.|$|E

Almost all of the death caused by electricity which happened in waters, neither electrical marks nor burns resulted in the macroscopic finding. The passage of a current across the chest may lead to respiratory paralysis from spasm of the intercostals muscles.

The primary determinant of damage caused by direct effects of electricity {{is the amount of}} current flowing through the body (amperage). This research had a purpose to know the correlation between the low tension <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> electrical exposure <b>with</b> different amperage to intercostals muscles histopathology characteristic of Wistar rats. Method : An experimental study using control group with post test only control group design to Wistar rats which was given an <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> electrical exposure. The samples which consist of 15 Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups. They were one control group, received standard diet and two treatment group, which was given an <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> electrical exposure <b>with</b> 50 mA for the first treatment group (P 1), and 100 mA for the second treatment group (P 2).

Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis method for between subject data. The statistical analysis was done with SPSS program for windows 15. 00. The difference is significant when p< 0, 05. Result : The results of the study shows that third group had the highest mean of hyperaemia as 0, 94 + 0, 38471; the first group had mean of hyperaemia as 0; the second group had mean of hyperaemia as 0, 34 + 0, 20736.

Conclusion : The <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> electrical exposure <b>with</b> 50 mA dan 100 mA for 10 seconds caused significant intercostals muscles damage of Wistar rats, which manifest as hyperaemia.
