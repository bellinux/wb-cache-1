While benefits of cloud computing are numerous, security concerns arising when data and computation are outsourced to a third party still hinder the complete movement to the cloud. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} problem of data privacy on the cloud, particularly on access controls over stream data. The nature of stream data and the complexity of sharing data make access control a more challenging issue than in traditional archival databases. We present Streamforce - a system allowing data owners to securely outsource their data to the cloud. The owner specifies fine-grained policies which are enforced by the cloud. The latter performs most of the heavy computations, while learning nothing about the data. To this end, we employ a number of encryption schemes, including deterministic encryption, proxy-based attribute based encryption and sliding-window encryption. In Streamforce, access control policies are modeled as secure continuous queries, which entails minimal changes to existing stream processing engines, and allows for easy expression of a wide-range of policies. In particular, Streamforce comes with a number of secure query operators including Map, Filter, Join and Aggregate. Finally, we implement Streamforce over an open source stream processing engine (Esper) and evaluate its performance on a cloud platform. The results demonstrate practical performance for many real-world applications, and although the security overhead is visible, Streamforce is highly scalable...|$|R

In nearby Cuba, rainfall reached 9.22in (234mm) and winds gusted to 53mph (85km/h); houses were flooded, crops were damaged, and livestock was killed as a result. Similar impacts occurred across the Cayman Islands, with sporadic power outages, flooding in low-lying locations, and damaged houses.

It is remarkable that nuclear transfer can produce physiologically normal animals, but the process is highly prone to epigenetic errors. Aberrant patterns of gene expression are believed to contribute to the cumulat-ive losses and abnormal phenotypes observed throughout development, from embryonic to adult stages. As a consequence, cloning efficiencies with current nuclear transfer technology are low and limit practical ap-plications in farming. These applications depend upon the reliability with which nuclear transfer can reproduce specific genotypes and phenotypes in resulting offspring. Present animal welfare issues are a significant bar-rier for acceptance of nuclear transfer in agriculture. Any long lastin...|$|R

Using {{this color}} information {{images can be}} segmented, analyzed, labeled and indexed. In content based image retrieval system, color {{is one of the}} basic primitive features used. In Prevalent Color Extraction and indexing, the most extensive color on an image is identified and it is used for indexing. For implementation, Asteroideae flower family image dataset is used. It consist of more than 16, 000 species, among them nearly 100 species are considered and indexed by dominating colors. To extract the most appealable color from the user defined images, the overall color of an image has to be quantized. Spatially, quantizing the color of an image to extract the prevalent color is the major objective of this paper. A combination of K-Mean and Expectation Minimization clustering algorithm called hidden-value learned K-mean clustering quantization algorithm is used to avoid the over clustering behavior of K-Mean algorithm.

40|$|Process {{planning}} and production scheduling are two important {{issues in the}} manufacturing system. In combination, they determine {{how and when to}} produce which products with what available resources. Traditionally, process {{planning and}} production scheduling are considered as two isolated tasks and conducted by separate departments with long time gap in manufacturing enterprises. Such isolation and time gap have become major limiting factors to fully utilize the manufacturing resources, and adversely impact on overall productivity. In Mass Customization environment, the isolation and time gap between process planning and production scheduling have become even more significant problems. The motivation to integrate process planning and production scheduling is developed to address such problems by unleashing the under-utilized resource flexibility. The objective of this research is to develop a novel framework to integrate process planning and production scheduling tasks in Mass Customization environment following make-to-order policy. In this framework, one novel data structure called 'Generic Production Capability' or GPC is proposed to model the production capabilities of resources on meta-level. Process planning in the framework will employ one declarative processing mechanism to generate process plans capturing all feasible production routings for the released customer orders on demand by linking and configuring proper sets of GPCs in sequence, but leave the selection of routing to production scheduling stage. Production scheduling will combine composite dispatching rules and simulated annealing approach to make fully use of the flexibility of alternative routing selection to derive more globally optimized time schedule to fulfill released customer orders (implication of integration in this research). Since the process plans are generated on demand with regard to status of resources on the shop floor, frequent modification of process plans on the shop in current practice is thus avoided. Moreover, the proposed framework also releases process planners from construction of process plans for a huge number of product variants offered to customers. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, <b>tremendous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> process planners' efforts can be saved...|$|R

40|$|How does dance mean? Why does {{movement}} {{outside of}} everyday gestures, set to music, and performed on stage move us? In essence, {{this is the}} question I ask of Alvin Ailey's dance, Revelations. Specifically, I am interested in the ways in which he has created a dance that embodies Black Church traditions and by extension, Black culture. The details of how Revelations means draw from roots deep in the past. The narrative Ailey presents through expressiveness of movement and the usage of Spirituals acts out the pain, hope, and often hopelessness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> people under <b>tremendous</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> hardship. Revelations also traces the overall will to survive and to be free and the triumph over adversity. This continues the tradition in the Black Church of affirming black humanity and Ailey does this by showcasing Black bodies and a Black narrative. This thesis identifies {{the ways in which the}} Black Church and its traditions are reflected in Ailey's Revelations. Black Church traditions can be defined by two over-arching characteristics: improvisation and affirmations of Black humanity. These two characteristics flow in and out of every subcategory tradition we will encounter. Those subcategories are Spirituals and Church worship services. Under the Spirituals tradition we see elements of call-and-response, parallels constructed between those of African descent and the persecuted characters in the Bible, and finally, the theme of wanting to go home(whether it be Heaven, Africa, or the North). Under the Church worship services, tradition we also see the theme of wanting to go home, and the element of call-and-response in addition to emotionalism, and movement that are all made manifest through the Pastor and the congregation. I argue that beyond simply being inspired by his church experiences, Ailey's usage of movement and Spirituals creates a dance that embodies these Black Church traditions. To argue this, I have relied on a plethora of scholars and professionals, from varying fields. These have included dance critics/scholarship/history; Music history, specifically, interpretations and analysis of the Spirituals; and Africana studies, specifically history and significance of the Black Church. I dedicate this thesis to Alvin Ailey, who still speaks to us, even now; and to the Pillars such as Katherine Dunham and Pearl Primus. May my work offer a glimpse of your beauty...|$|R
