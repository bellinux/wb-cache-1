40|$|Raised bogs {{started to}} form in Ireland at least 7000 years ago when peat started to {{accumulate}} in water-filled depressions left after the last glacial period. Due to centuries of damaging human activities, only 1 % of the living, growing <b>active</b> <b>raised</b> bog habitat remains and this is rapidly being lost. Raised bogs are important reservoirs of biodiversity, hosting many uniquely adapted {{plant and animal species}} and are of high conservation concern internationally. The aims of this study were to objectively assess the potential of macro-moths as <b>active</b> <b>raised</b> bog biodiversity indicators, to collate baseline information on the distribution of this fauna on threatened midland raised bog habitat and to identify species with restricted distributions which may be of conservation concern. Macro-moths were sampled using light-traps on twelve midland raised bogs from early July to the end of October in 2011. Six high conservation value bogs designated as Special Areas of Conservations (SACs) and six undesignated and degraded bogs were surveyed. A total of 1, 816 adult individuals of 93 moth species were recorded, representing 16 % of the Irish moth fauna. Four species new to County Offaly were recorded. Only two potential indicator species of <b>active</b> <b>raised</b> bog were found, with only one species (Acronicta menyanthidis (Esper, 1789)) significantly correlated with the wettest areas of <b>active</b> <b>raised</b> bog (P = 0. 01). Raised bog associated nocturnal macro-moth assemblages showed a significantly nested structure (P < 0. 01), common in fragmented habitats, whereby species-poor sites form a nested subset of species-rich sites. The difference between designated and undesignated raised bog associated moth assemblages was significant (A = 0. 044; P = 0. 038), but within group homogeneity was low. As designated and undesignated bogs contain assemblages which are broadly similar, {{the findings of this study}} would suggest that even degraded undesignated raised bog remnants, may be of significant conservation value for macro-moth species...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} tree (lodgepole pine) {{planting}} {{with and without}} intensive drainage on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes was assessed after 45 yr at a <b>raised</b> <b>peatbog</b> in West Flanders Moss, central Scotland. Fluxes of CO 2 CH 4 and N 2 O from the soil were monitored over a 2 -yr period every 2 to 4 weeks using the static opaque chamber method in a randomised experimental block trial with the following treatments: drained and planted (DP), undrained and planted (uDP), undrained and unplanted (uDuP) and for reference also from an adjoining near-pristine area of bog at East Flanders Moss (n-pris). There was a strong seasonal pattern in both CO 2 and CH 4 effluxes which were significantly higher in late spring and summer months because of warmer temperatures. Effluxes of N 2 O were low and {{no significant differences were}} observed between the treatments. Annual CH 4 emissions increased with the proximity of the water table to the soil surface across treatments in the order: DP 4 m − 2 yr − 1, respectively. For CO 2, effluxes increased in the order uDP 2 m − 2 yr − 1, respectively. CO 2 effluxes dominated the total net GHG emission, calculated using the global warming potential (GWP) of the three GHGs for each treatment (76 – 98 %), and only in the n-pris site was CH 4 a substantial contribution (23 %). Based on soil effluxes only, the near pristine (n-pris) peatbog had 43 % higher total net GHG emission compared with the DP treatment because of high CH 4 effluxes and the DP treatment had 33 % higher total net emission compared with the uDP because drainage increased CO 2 effluxes. Restoration is likely to increase CH 4 emissions, but reduce CO 2 effluxes. Our study suggests that if estimates of CO 2 uptake by vegetation from similar peatbog sites were included, the total net GHG emission of restored peatbog would still be higher than that of the peatbog with trees...|$|R

50|$|The {{assessment}} {{designated the}} primary feature for {{the selection of}} Cors Caron as <b>active</b> <b>raised</b> bog described as:The Cors Caron sequence of peat domes (also known as Tregaron Bog) developed on the floodplain of the Afon (River) Teifi in mid-Wales now represents the most intact surviving example in the UK of a raised bog landscape (macrotope). The three main extant domes are hydrologically isolated by the River Teifi and associated surface drainage features, and all three have suffered extensive damage {{as a consequence of}} past drainage and peat-cutting. The river terraces associated with the component bog mesotopes are regularly flooded and support vegetation that includes reed canary-grass Phalaris arundinacea, soft rush Juncus effusus, purple moor-grassMolinia caerulea and, more rarely, water sedge Carex aquatilis. Substantial areas of the surface of each of the three component bogs still retain good quality <b>active</b> <b>raised</b> bog vegetation mainly referable to NVC type M18 Sphagnum papillosum - Erica tetralix community, with frequent bog-rosemary Andromeda polifolia and white beak-sedge Rhynchospora alba and, more locally, the bog-mosses Sphagnum magellanicum and S. pulchrum. Extensive areas with a high cover of heather Calluna vulgaris and deergrass Trichophorum cespitosum are also present, while purple moor-grass M. caerulea is particularly prominent on the more modified bog margins. Although present as an important peat-former until as recently as the 18th century, Sphagnum imbricatum is absent from the contemporary bog flora.|$|R
