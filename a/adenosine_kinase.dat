5000|$|Adenosine is an {{inhibitory}} nucleoside {{that doubles}} up as a neuromodulator, aiding in the modulation of brain function. It has anti-inflammatory properties, {{in addition to}} neuroprotective and anti-epileptic properties. The most prevalent theory is that upon brain injury there is an increased expression of the <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinase</b> (ADK). The increase in <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinase</b> results in an increased metabolic rate for adenosine nucleosides. Due to the decrease in these nucleosides that possess anti-epileptic properties and the overexpression of the ADK, seizures are triggered, potentially resulting {{in the development of}} epileptogenesis. [...] Studies have shown that ADK overexpression results from astrogliosis following a brain injury, which can lead to the development of epileptogenesis. While ADK overexpression leads to increased susceptibility to seizures, the effects can be counteracted and moderated by adenosine. Based on the properties afforded by adenosine in preventing seizures, in addition to its FDA approval in the treatment of other ailments such as tachycardia and chronic pain, adenosine is an ideal target for the development of anti-epileptic gene therapies.|$|E

The members of the PfkB/RK family are identified {{by the presence of}} three conserved sequence motifs. The structures of several PfK family of proteins have been determined from a number of organisms and the enzymatic activity of this family of protein shows a dependence on the presence of pentavalent ions.|$|E
50|$|The {{nucleoside}} form of AICAR, acadesine, is {{an analog}} of adenosine that enters cardiac cells to inhibit <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinase</b> and adenosine deaminase. It enhances {{the rate of}} nucleotide re-synthesis increasing adenosine generation from adenosine monophosphate only during conditions of myocardial ischemia. In cardiac myocytes, acadesine is phosphorylated to AICAR to activate AMPK without changing the levels of the nucleotides. AICAR is able to enter the de novo synthesis pathway for adenosine synthesis to inhibit adenosine deaminase causing an increase in ATP levels and adenosine levels.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinase,</b> an {{abundant}} enzyme in mammalian tissues. The enzyme catalyzes {{the transfer of}} the gamma-phosphate from ATP to adenosine, thereby serving as a regulator of concentrations of both extracellular adenosine and intracellular adenine nucleotides. Adenosine has widespread effects on the cardiovascular, nervous, respiratory, and immune systems and inhibitors of the enzyme could play an important pharmacological role in increasing intravascular adenosine concentrations and acting as anti-inflammatory agents. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Both isoforms of the enzyme phosphorylate adenosine with identical kinetics and both require Mg2+ for activity.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe gene {{responsible}} for ribokinase (RK) in human/eukaryotic cells {{has not yet}} been identified/characterized. Blast searches with E. coli RK have identified a human protein showing significant similarity to the bacterial RK. The cDNA for this protein was expressed in E. coli and the recombinant protein efficiently phosphorylated ribose to ribose- 5 -phosphate using ATP, confirming its identity as RK. In contrast to ribose, the enzyme exhibited very little to no phosphorylation of d-arabinose, d-xylose, d-fructose and d-galactose. The catalytic activity of human RK was dependent upon the presence of inorganic phosphate, as observed previously for E. coli RK and mammalian <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinases</b> (AK). A number of activators and inhibitors of human AK, produced very similar effects on the human and E. coli RKs, indicating that the catalytic mechanism of RK is very {{similar to that of the}} AKs...|$|R

40|$|Phosphofructokinase- 2 (Pfk- 2) from Escherichia coli {{belongs to}} the ribokinase family of sugar kinases. One of the {{signatures}} observed in amino acid sequences from the ribokinase familiy members is the NXXE motif, which locates at the active site in the ribokinase fold. It {{has been suggested that}} the effect of Mg 2 + and phosphate ions on enzymatic activity, observed in several <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinases</b> and ribokinases, would be a widespread feature in the ribokinase family, with the conserved amino acid residues in the NXXE motif playing a role in the binding of these ions at the active site [Maj, M. C., et al. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 4059 - 4069]. In this work we study the effect of Mg 2 + and phosphate ions on Pfk- 2 activity and the involvement of residue E 190 from the NXXE motif in this behavior. The kinetic data are in agreement with the requirement of a Mg 2 + ion, besides the one present in the metal-nucleotide complex, for catalysis in the wild-type enzyme. Since the response to free Mg 2 + concentration is greatly affected in the E 190 Q mutant, we conclude that this residue is required for the proper binding of the catalytic Mg 2 + ion at the active site. The E 190 Q mutant presents a 50 -fold decrease in the kcat value and a 15 -fold increment in the apparent Km for MgATP 2 -. Inorganic phosphate, typically considered an activator of <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinases,</b> ribokinases, and phosphofructokinases (nonhomologous to Pfk- 2) acted as an inhibitor of wild-type and E 190 Q mutant Pfk- 2. We suggest that phosphate can bind to the allosteric site of Pfk- 2, producing an inhibition pattern qualitatively similar to MgATP 2 -, which can be reversed to some extent by increasing the concentration of fructose- 6 -P. Given that the E 190 Q mutant presents alterations in the inhibition by MgATP 2 - and phosphate, we conclude that the E 190 residue has a role not only in catalysis but also in allosteric regulation.

50|$|The {{systematic}} {{name of this}} enzyme class is ATP:D-ribose 5-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include deoxyribokinase, ribokinase (phosphorylating), and D-ribokinase. This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway. Ribokinase (RK) belongs to the phosphofructokinase B (PfkB) family of sugar kinases. Other members of this family (also known as the RK family) include <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinase</b> (AK), inosine-guanosine kinase, fructokinase, and 1-phosphofructokinase. The members of the PfkB/RK family are identified {{by the presence of}} three conserved sequence motifs and the enzymatic activity of this family of protein generally shows a dependence on the presence of pentavalent ions. The conserved NXXE motif, which is a distinctive property of the PfkB family of proteins, is involved in pentavalent ion dependency. The structures of RK and several other PfK family of proteins have been determined from a number of organisms. Despite low sequence similarity between AdK and other PfkB family of proteins, these proteins are quite similar at structural levels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Adenosine</b> <b>kinase</b> (AdK; EC 2.7.1.20) is {{an enzyme}} that catalyzes the {{transfer}} of gamma-phosphate from Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine (Ado) leading to formation of Adenosine monophosphate (AMP). In addition to its well-studied role in controlling the cellular concentration of Ado, AdK also {{plays an important role}} in the maintenance of methylation reactions. All S-adenosylmethionine-dependent transmethylation reactions in cells lead to production of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is cleaved by SAH hydrolase into Ado and homocysteine. The failure to efficiently remove these end products (Ado removed by phosphorylation by AdK) can result in buildup of SAH, which is a potent inhibitor of all transmethylation reactions. The disruption of AdK gene (-/-) in mice causes neonatal hepatic steatosis, a fatal condition characterized by rapid microvesicular fat infiltration, leading to early postnatal death. The liver was the main organ affected in these animals and in it the levels of adenine nucleotides were decreased, while those of SAH were elevated. Recently, missense mutations in the AdK gene in humans which result in AdK deficiency have also been shown to cause hypermethioninemia, encephalopathy and abnormal liver function.|$|E
40|$|Endogenous {{adenosine}} in {{the brain}} is thought to prevent the development and spread of seizures via a tonic anticonvulsant effect. Brain levels of adenosine are primarily regulated by the activity of <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinase.</b> To establish a link between <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinase</b> expression and seizure activity, we analyzed the expression of <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinase</b> {{in the brain}} of control mice and in a kainic acid-induced mouse model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain sections of control mice revealed intense staining for <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinase,</b> mainly in astrocytes, which {{were more or less}} evenly distributed throughout the brain, as well as in some neurons, particularly in olfactory bulb, striatum, and brainstem. In contrast, hippocampi lesioned by a unilateral kainic acid injection displayed profound astrogliosis and therefore a significant increase in <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinase</b> immunoreactivity accompanied by a corresponding increase of enzyme activity, which paralleled chronic recurrent seizure activity in this brain region. Accordingly, seizures and interictal spikes were suppressed by the injection of a low dose of the <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitor 5 -iodotubercidin. We conclude that overexpression of <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinase</b> in discrete parts of the epileptic hippocampus may contribute to the development and progression of seizure activity.

Research Methods and Procedures: Ten subjects consumed a normal-fat (NF) diet for 1 week, followed by an HF diet for another week. After both dietary periods, we determined the IMCL content by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the vastus lateralis muscle and quantified changes in gene expression, protein content, and activity in biopsy samples. We investigated genes involved in carbohydrate and fatty acid handling [lipoprotein lipase, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) 2, hormone-sensitive lipase, hexokinase II, and glucose transporter 4] and measured protein levels of CD 36 and phosphorylated and unphosphorylated ACC 2 and the activity of <b>adenosine</b> monophosphate-activated <b>kinase.</b> Results: IMCL content was increased by 54 % after the HF period.

Castrated cockerels on long photo-periods have a decline in cAMP-PK activity ratios after an elevation at 1 week following testoster-one removal.

Using a rat model of myocardial infarction, we examined the protective effects of <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibition. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 30 min regional occlusion followed by 90 min reperfusion. Infarct size, expressed {{as a percent of}} the area-at-risk, IS/AAR(%), was 58. 0 ᠲ. 1 % in untreated rats. Pretreatment with the <b>adenosine</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitor, 5 -iodotubercidin (1 mg/kg), limited infarct development to 37. 5 ᳮ 7 % (P < 0. 001). The A 1 adenosine receptor (A 1 AR) antagonist, DPCPX (100 姯kg), abolished the infarct-sparing effect of 5 -iodotubercidin (IS, 62. 8 ᠱ. 3 %). Similarly, the A 3 adenosine receptor (A 3 AR) antagonist, MRS- 1523 (2 mg/kg), and the d-opioid receptor (DOR) antagonist, BNTX, (1 mg/kg) abolished the reduction of IS produced by iodotubercidin. Pretreatment with the ROS scavenger, 2 -MPG (20 mg/kg), or the PKC-d antagonist, rottlerin (0. 3 mg/kg) also abolished iodotubercidin-mediated cardioprotection.

In the present study, we investigated the pro-apoptotic effects of the ethanol extract of Moutan Cortex Radicis in human gastric cancer AGS cells. Moutan Cortex Radicis treatment inhibited the cell viability of AGS cells in a concentration-dependent manner, which was associated with apoptotic cell death. Moutan Cortex Radicis's induction of apoptosis was connected with the upregulation of death receptor 4, death receptor 5, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, Fas ligand, and Bax, and the downregulation of Bcl- 2 and Bid. Moutan Cortex Radicis treatment also induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), the proteolytic activation of caspases (- 3, - 8, and - 9), and the degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, an activated caspase- 3 substrate protein. However, the pre-treatment of a caspase- 3 inhibitor significantly attenuated Moutan Cortex Radicis-induced apoptosis and cell viability reduction. In addition, Moutan Cortex Radicis treatment effectively activated the <b>adenosine</b> monophosphate-activated protein <b>kinase</b> signaling pathway; however, a specific inhibitor of AMPK significantly reduced Moutan Cortex Radicis-induced apoptosis.
