5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother {{who has spent}} many an hour {{hovering}} over my son with <b>a</b> <b>thermometer</b> and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't {{want to go out}} for dinner with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew in the care of their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E

5|$|Detective Michael Tritter is a {{recurring}} fictional {{character in the}} medical drama series House, portrayed by David Morse. He is the main antagonist of the third season, which ran between 2006 and 2007. Tritter is a police detective, who tries to get Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) to apologize for leaving him in an examination room with <b>a</b> <b>thermometer</b> in his rectum. After House refuses to apologize, Tritter researches House's background and discovers his Vicodin addiction. Tritter turns people close to House against him and forces House to go to rehab. When the case ultimately comes to court, the judge sentences House to one night in jail, for contempt of court, and to finish his rehabilitation, telling Tritter that she believes House is not the drug addict {{he tried to make}} him out to be.|$|E
5|$|On {{the table}} are various {{other pieces of}} {{equipment}} that the natural philosopher would have used during his demonstration: <b>a</b> <b>thermometer,</b> candle snuffer and cork, {{and close to the}} man seated to the right is a pair of Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time. What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E

50|$|Body {{temperature}} {{can also}} be taken in the rectum. Rectal temperature can be taken by inserting <b>a</b> medical <b>thermometer</b> not more than 25 mm (1 inch) into the rectum via the anus. <b>A</b> mercury <b>thermometer</b> should be inserted for 3 to 5 minutes; <b>a</b> digital <b>thermometer</b> should remain inserted until it beeps. Normal rectal temperature generally ranges from 36 to 38 °C (96.8 to 100.4 °F) and is about 0.5 °C (1 °F) above oral (mouth) temperature and about 1 °C (2 °F) above axilla (armpit) temperature.|$|R
25|$|Temperature is a {{physical}} quantity expressing the subjective perceptions of hot and cold. Temperature is measured with <b>a</b> <b>thermometer,</b> historically calibrated in various temperature scales and units of measurement. The most commonly used scales are the Celsius scale, denoted in °C (informally, degrees centigrade), the Fahrenheit scale (°F), and the Kelvin scale. The kelvin (K) is the unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI), in which temperature {{is one of the}} seven fundamental base units.|$|E
25|$|Latent heat is {{the heat}} {{released}} or absorbed by a chemical substance or a thermodynamic system during {{a change of}} state that occurs without a change in temperature. Such a process may be a phase transition, such as the melting of ice or the boiling of water. The term was introduced around 1750 by Joseph Black as derived from the Latin latere (to lie hidden), characterizing its effect as not being directly measurable with <b>a</b> <b>thermometer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Unruh effect (or {{sometimes}} Fulling–Davies–Unruh effect) is {{the prediction}} that an accelerating observer will observe blackbody radiation where an inertial observer would observe none. In other words, the background {{appears to be}} warm from an accelerating reference frame; in layman's terms, <b>a</b> <b>thermometer</b> waved around in empty space, subtracting any other contribution to its temperature, will record a non-zero temperature. The ground state for an inertial observer is seen as in thermodynamic equilibrium with a non-zero temperature by the uniformly accelerating observer.|$|E

25|$|Hinrichs {{told friends}} and {{fraternity}} brothers {{that he liked}} explosives, and frequently experimented with building and detonating bombs made in or of plastic soda bottles. Hinrichs kept detailed records of many experiments he performed, done mostly at Red Rock Canyon in Caddo County, in the weeks prior to his death. Along with the chemicals and the suicide note, they found used artillery shells, spent bullets, belts made of used brass shell casings, and military ammunition boxes. Other items taken in the search included <b>a</b> <b>thermometer,</b> a slow cooker, rolls of tape, mixing bowls, and plastic containers.|$|E
25|$|Empirically based {{temperature}} scales rely {{directly on}} measurements of simple physical properties of materials. For example, {{the length of}} a column of mercury, confined in a glass-walled capillary tube, is dependent largely on temperature, and is the basis of the very useful mercury-in-glass thermometer. Such scales are valid only within convenient ranges of temperature. For example, above the boiling point of mercury, a mercury-in-glass thermometer is impracticable. Most materials expand with temperature increase, but some materials, such as water, contract with temperature increase over some specific range, and then they are hardly useful as thermometric materials. A material is of no use as <b>a</b> <b>thermometer</b> near one of its phase-change temperatures, for example its boiling-point.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong's view of {{knowledge}} is that the conditions {{of knowledge}} are satisfied {{when you have a}} justified true belief that you arrived at through a reliable process: that is, the belief was caused by some factor in the external world (hence the label of externalism). Armstrong uses the analogy of a thermometer: as <b>a</b> <b>thermometer</b> changes to reflect the temperature of the environment it is in, so must one's beliefs if they are reliably formed. The connection between knowledge and the external world, for Armstrong, is a nomological relationship (that is, a law of nature relationship). Here, Armstrong's view is broadly similar to that of Alvin Goldman and Robert Nozick. The intuitions that lead to this kind of externalism led Alvin Plantinga towards an account of knowledge that added the requirement for 'properly-functioning' cognitive systems operating according to a design plan.|$|E

25|$|On 19 January 2012 the {{interior}} of the primary containment vessel of reactor 2 was inspected with an industrial endoscope. This device, 8.5 millimeters in diameter, is equipped with a 360 degrees-view camera and <b>a</b> <b>thermometer</b> to measure the temperature at this spot and the cooling-water inside, in an attempt to calibrate the existing temperature-measurements that could have an error-margin of 20 degrees. The device was brought in by a hole at 2.5 meter above the floor where the vessel is located. The whole procedure lasted 70 minutes. The photos showed parts of the walls and pipes inside the containment vessel. But they were unclear and blurred, most likely due to water vapors and the radiation inside. According to TEPCO the photos showed no serious damage. The temperature measured inside was 44.7 degrees Celsius, and did not differ much from the 42.6 degrees measured outside the vessel.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{temperature}} in a drying kiln is the dry-bulb temperature (usually denoted by Tg), {{which is the}} temperature of a vapour-gas mixture determined by inserting <b>a</b> <b>thermometer</b> with a dry bulb. On the other hand, the wet-bulb temperature (TW) {{is defined as the}} temperature reached by a small amount of liquid evaporating in a large amount of an unsaturated air-vapour mixture. The temperature sensing element of this thermometer is kept moist with a porous fabric sleeve (cloth) usually put in a reservoir of clean water. A minimum air flow of 2m/s is needed to prevent a zone of stagnant damp air formation around the sleeve (Walker et al., 1993). Since air passes over the wet sleeve, water is evaporated and cools the wet-bulb thermometer. The difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, the wet-bulb depression, is used to determine the relative humidity from a standard hygrometric chart (Walker et al., 1993). A higher difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures indicates a lower relative humidity. For example, if the dry-bulb temperature is 100°C and wet-bulb temperature 60°C, then the relative humidity is read as 17% from a hygrometric chart.|$|E
25|$|In 1843 Wheatstone communicated an {{important}} {{paper to the}} Royal Society, entitled 'An Account of Several New Processes for Determining the Constants of a Voltaic Circuit.' It contained an exposition of the well known balance for measuring the electrical resistance of a conductor, which still {{goes by the name}} of Wheatstone's Bridge or balance, although it was first devised by Samuel Hunter Christie, of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, who published it in the Philosophical Transactions for 1833. The method was neglected until Wheatstone brought it into notice. His paper abounds with simple and practical formulae for the calculation of currents and resistances by the law of Ohm. He introduced a unit of resistance, namely, a foot of copper wire weighing one hundred grains (6.5 g), and showed how it might be applied to measure the length of wire by its resistance. He was awarded a medal for his paper by the Society. The same year he invented an apparatus which enabled the reading of <b>a</b> <b>thermometer</b> or a barometer to be registered at a distance by means of an electric contact made by the mercury. A sound telegraph, in which the signals were given by the strokes of a bell, was also patented by Cooke and Wheatstone in May of that year.|$|E
