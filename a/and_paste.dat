25|$|Accelerators are {{a form of}} selection-based search {{which allow}} a user to invoke an online service from any other page using only the mouse. Actions such as {{selecting}} the text or other objects will give users access to the usable Accelerator services (such as blogging with the selected text, or viewing a map of a selected geographical location), which can then be invoked with the selected object. According to Microsoft, Accelerators eliminate the need to copy <b>and</b> <b>paste</b> content between web pages. IE8 specifies an XML-based encoding which allows a web application or web service to be invoked as an Accelerator service. How the service will be invoked and for what categories of content it will show up are specified in the XML file. Similarities have been drawn between Accelerators and the controversial Smart tags feature experimented with in the IE 6 Beta but withdrawn after criticism (though later included in MS Office).|$|E
40|$|We {{define the}} problem of decomposing human-written summary {{sentences}} and propose a novel Hidden Markov Model solution to the problem. Human summarizers often rely on cutting <b>and</b> <b>pasting</b> of the full document to generate summaries. Decomposing a human-written summary sentence requires determining: (1) whether it is constructed by cutting <b>and</b> <b>pasting,</b> (2) what components in the sentence come from the original document, and (3) where in the document the components come from. Solving the decomposition problem can potentially lead to the automatic acquisition of large corpora for summarization. It also sheds light on the generation of summary text by cutting <b>and</b> <b>pasting.</b> The evaluation shows that the proposed decomposition algorithm performs well. ...|$|R

25|$|A month {{into his}} term as premier, an article {{published}} in Nature reported that an anonymous source had charged Ponta with plagiarizing over half his doctoral thesis, claims that were later reiterated by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Ponta admitted that the referencing system used by his thesis did not provide clear attribution of its sources, but rejected the allegations of plagiarism. Dumitru Diaconu, a law professor and author supposedly plagiarised by Ponta's thesis, and who also authored a foreword for the published edition of the thesis, declared he was not aware of plagiarism and did not intend to pursue the accusations. A session of a committee charged with validating academic titles analyzed the thesis and decided with a unanimous vote of members present that Ponta had committed copy <b>and</b> <b>paste</b> plagiarism, subsequently requesting the withdrawal of Ponta's doctoral title. In response, interim Education Minister Liviu Pop (PSD) contested the committee's jurisdiction and dismissed the findings, citing the lack of a quorum. The minister had already signed an order reorganizing the committee the previous day, but, due to technical reasons, the order came into effect during the very session analyzing the thesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} cylinder boxes have a plain {{brown paper}} exterior, sometimes rubber-stamped {{with the company}} name. By the late 1890s, record companies usually pasted a generic printed label around {{the outside of the}} box, sometimes with a penciled catalog number but no other indication of the identity of the recording inside. A slip of paper stating the title and performer was placed inside the box with the cylinder. At first this information was hand-written or typed on each slip, but printed versions became more common once cylinders were sold in large enough quantities to justify the printing set-up cost. The recording itself usually began with a spoken announcement of the title and performer and also the name of the record company. On a typical Edison record slip from 1903, the consumer is invited to cut off a coupon with the printed information <b>and</b> <b>paste</b> it onto the lid of the box. Alternatively, a circular area within the coupon could be cut out and pasted onto the end of a spindle for that cylinder in one of the specially built cases and cabinets made for storing cylinder records. Only a minority of cylinder record customers purchased such storage units, however. Slightly later, the record number was stamped on the lid, then later still a printed label with the title and artist information was factory-applied to the lid. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, an abbreviated version of this information was impressed into or printed on one edge of the cylinder itself.|$|E

500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly was keen on Isaacs' {{acting in}} the series. [...] "It helps {{enormously}} to have Isaacs playing the lead. This actor knows how to convey a gravity that contrasts well with the series' airy concept, but he avoids becoming heavy and morose." [...] Fowler stated that Isaacs [...] "delivers a graceful and subdued performance as a man who, on a daily basis, must taste both heaven and hell. A man full of guilt, but also gratitude." [...] Fowler noted that Allen and Minnette's {{acting in the}} series deserved praise for playing characters dealing with loss without closure, while Starr called the casting [...] "fine all-around". Critics from IGN <b>and</b> <b>Paste</b> contended that Isaacs' performance deserved an Emmy Award. After Awake cancellation, Mareen Ryan of The Huffington Post hoped that new dramas on NBC would [...] "achieve the kind of visual and emotional poetry that Awake did."

Helgeson {{stated that}} the fast-paced [...] "levels are poorly designed", and Andrew Reiner, who wrote a second-opinion review for Game Informer, called the level design [...] "disastrous". Official Xbox Magazine was more mixed, balancing the possibility of getting lost in the large levels with the likely appeal of these stages to 3D Sonic gamers, particularly those who had enjoyed Sonic Heroes. GameTrailers found that [...] "the levels are either dark and urban, or bright and psychedelic. Either way, they fit in well to the Sonic universe. They are loaded with speed ramps, loops {{and an assortment of}} other boosts that rocket Shadow like a pinball." [...] Bettenhausen included [...] "the classic run-like-hell roller coaster design philosophy" [...] of some stages in his limited praise. Casamassina deplored the [...] "stupid level design", adding that [...] "Just because they dazzled players six years ago does not mean that Sonic Team can copy <b>and</b> <b>paste</b> exactly the same loops and spins into each new franchise iteration and expect everyone to be happy with the outcome." [...] GameSpy observed that [...] "the areas are much less open than in previous Sonic games, but the level designers haven't taken advantage of the constraints." [...] Nintendo Power singled out the difficulty of the missions that require the player to locate objects.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of the mix {{composition}} on rheological behavior of a mixture is studied by considering a two-phase model for a mixture. A mixture is decomposed into a granular <b>and</b> a <b>paste</b> phase. Paste itself is divided into the void <b>paste</b> <b>and</b> the excess <b>paste.</b> The slump test is used for evaluation of rheological behavior of a mixture. The results show that the granular-cement paste mixtures can be split into three main classes viz Granular-High <b>Paste,</b> Granular-Intermediate <b>Paste</b> <b>and</b> Granular-Low <b>Paste.</b> In Granular-High Paste class, the behavior is governed by the excess <b>paste</b> <b>and</b> the capacity of deformation of mixtures is maximal. In Granular-Low Paste class, the behavior is governed by the void <b>paste</b> <b>and</b> the capacity of deformation of mixtures is minimal. In Granular-Intermediate Paste class the behavior is determined by both the excess <b>paste</b> <b>and</b> the void <b>paste,</b> <b>and</b> the deformability is in between that of the two other extreme cases.
