40|$|Stakeholders {{promoting}} {{landfill gas}} (LFG) energy projects are identifying new funding incentives to implement LFG energy (LFGE) projects. This presentation focuses on how landfills {{are participating in}} voluntary carbon and renewable energy markets, and presents case studies from award-winning projects that utilize these funding mechanisms. Landfills participate in the voluntary carbon markets using one of two main mechanisms: on an exchange or through an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction. An exchange, such as the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), is likely the most well known mechanism. At present, CCX has 35 registered landfill methane offset project providers in the United States [1]. As of April 2008, landfill methane projects comprised approximately 9 {{percent of all the}} carbon credits issued by CCX. OTC transactions are private between the seller, buyer, and/or broker involved in the transaction. Despite their private nature, the volume of OTC traded emissions has substantially grown in recent years according to research from Ecosystem Marketplace [2]. Recent data from Point Carbon indicate that 132 U. S. landfills have either made a transaction in the carbon market, or {{are in the process of}} developing, producing, certifying, or verifying their emissions reductions in order to prepare for an OTC transaction or exchange on the CCX [3]. In addition to carbon finance, LFGE projects generating electricity are also selling Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). These RECs are then purchased by companies wishing to reduce their environmental footprint or used by utilities to comply with various renewable portfolio standards. Stakeholders are also using state and federal financial incentives to promote LFGE projects. In 2008, the IRS awarded 45 <b>applicants</b> the <b>authority</b> to issue Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs) to support LFGE projects [4]. Several other new financial incentives were funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) including the Energ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The move to {{national}} registration of health professionals {{and the creation}} of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) provides both challenges and opportunities for the regulation of nurse practitioners (NPs) in Australia.

In today’s action we promulgate several additions and {{changes to the}} Guideline. We recommend a new dispersion model— AERMOD—for adoption in appendix A of the Guideline. AERMOD replaces the Industrial Source Complex (ISC 3) model, applies to complex terrain, and incorporates a new downwash algorithm—PRIME. We remove an existing model—the Emissions Dispersion Modeling System (EDMS) — from appendix A. We also make various editorial changes to update and reorganize information. DATES: This rule is effective December 9, 2005. As proposed, beginning November 9, 2006, the new model—AERMOD— {{should be used for}} appropriate application as replacement for ISC 3.

This Guidance of the PPR Panel {{is the first of}} three {{requested}} deliverables within this mandate. It has its focus on tiered acute and chronic effect assessment schemes with detailed guidance on tier 1 and higher tier effect assessments for aquatic organisms in edge-of-field surface waters and on proposals regarding how to link effects to exposure estimates. The exposure assessment methodology was not reviewed and it is assumed that the current FOCUS surface water exposure assessment methodology will continue to be used for exposure assessment at EU level. The current GD is intended to be used for authorisation of active substances at EU level as well as for plant protection products at Member State level. The effect assessment schemes in this GD allow for the derivation of regulatory acceptable concentrations (RACs) on the basis of two options: (1) the ecological threshold option (ETO), accepting negligible population effects only, and (2) the ecological recovery option (ERO), accepting some population-level effects if ecological recovery takes place within an acceptable time period. In the tiered effect assessment schemes, in principle, all tiers (1, 2 and 3) are able to address the ETO, while the model ecosystem approach (tier 3), under certain conditions, is able to also address the ERO. The GD provides the scientific background for the risk assessment to aquatic organisms in edge-of-field surface waters and is structured to give detailed guidance on all assessment steps. An executive summary joining all parts of the guidance and decision schemes in a concise way is provided and is intended to help <b>applicants</b> and regulatory <b>authorities</b> in day-to-day use...|$|R
40|$|Over the years, public {{universities}} in Ghana {{have been unable}} to admit up to half of qualified applicants into their conventional programs. Due to rapid population growth in the country, coupled with an ever increasing demand for higher education in universities with limited physical facilities, several tens of thousands of qualified applicants are denied access to university education which not only creates a kind of unhealthy competition for instructional space but also increases cost of a college education beyond the means of most <b>applicants.</b> The educational <b>authorities</b> of Ghana, in response to this crisis, recently adopted distance education as a second mode of educational delivery with a potential to addressing the problems of the traditional system. ^ This study assessed the effectiveness of four public university-operated Distance Education Programs (DEPs) in Ghana by examining elements of accessibility, affordability, equity, funding, program offerings, and administration. Using the Logic Model as an assessment tool, the evaluative study adopted a case study approach involving a multi-sited DEP. The study mixed both quantitative and qualitative research methods as well as data collection methods in order to ensure credibility, validity, and reliability of both the data gathered and findings from a comparative analysis of such data. It involved review of DEP records, cross-sectional student survey, and interview of program officials. Analysis of the resulting triangulation of data was conducted at two levels: (1) individual program analysis, and (2) across-program analysis. While the program level analysis provided useful information {{on the extent to which}} the individual programs were pursuing their respective objectives, the analysis across programs provided a system-wide overview of the DEPs regarding their pursuit of objectives of national interest. ^ Findings of the study revealed that the Ghanaian DEPs were largely ineffective in the provision of increased access, reduced participation fees, and equity in the distribution of educational opportunities.

5000|$|Interstate {{pipeline}} {{companies in}} the US {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Prior to 1992, these companies owned all the gas that flowed through their systems. This also included gas in their storage facility, over which they had complete control. Then FERC Order 636 was implemented. This required the companies to operate their facilities, including gas storage on an open access basis. For gas storage, this meant that these companies could only reserve the capacity needed to maintain system integrity. The rest of the capacity would be available for leasing to third parties on a nondiscriminatory basis. Open access has opened a wide variety of application for gas storage, particularly for marketers which can now exploit price arbitrage opportunities. Any storage capacity would be priced at cost-based pricing, unless the provider can demonstrate to FERC that it lacks market power, in which case it may be allowed to price at market-based rates to gain market share. FERC defines market power as [...] "..the ability of a seller profitably to maintain prices above competitive levels for a significant period of time.". The underlying pricing structure for storage has discouraged development in the gas storage sector, which has not seen many new storage facilities constructed, besides current ones being expanded. In 2005, FERC announced a new Order 678 targeted particularly to gas storage. This rule is intended to stimulate the development of new gas storage facility in the ultimate goal of reducing natural gas price volatility. Commission Chairman Joseph T. Kelliher observed: [...] "Since 1988, natural gas demand in the United States has risen 24 percent. Over the same period, gas storage capacity has increased only 1.4 percent. While construction of storage capacity has lagged behind the demand for natural gas, we have seen record levels of price volatility. This suggests that current storage capacity is inadequate. Further, this year, what storage capacity exists may be full far earlier than in any previous year. According to some analysts, that raises the prospect that some domestic gas production may be shut-in. Our final rule should help reduce price volatility and expand storage capacity."This ruling aims at opening up two approaches for developers of natural gas storage, to be able to charge market-based rates. The first one is the redefinition of the relevant product market for storage that includes alternatives for storage such as available pipeline capacity, local gas production and LNG terminals. The second approach aims at implementing section 312 of the Energy Policy Act. It would allow an <b>applicant</b> to request <b>authority</b> to charge [...] "market-based rates even if a lack of market power has not been demonstrated, in circumstances where market-based rates are in the public interest and necessary to encourage the construction of storage capacity in the area needing storage service and that customers are adequately protected," [...] theCommission said. It is expected that this new order will entice developers, especially independent storage operators, to develop new facilities in the near future.|$|R
40|$|Cumulative {{effects are}} {{incrementally}} additive effects which become significant {{at a certain}} point. Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) {{is the process of}} assessing the cumulative effects of a project or policy. Such cumulative effects currently form a major environmental issue in New Zealand, as does the process of CEA. The literature surrounding CEA shows in explicit detail that it is a very challenging process, fraught with difficulties. Cumulative effects are inherent within the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) and are required to be addressed by local authorities when; developing plans, assessing resource consent applications, and undertaking other tasks in order to prevent the cumulative degradation of our country’s resources. This research undertaken in this dissertation investigates the different approaches that six local authorities have taken towards addressing cumulative effects and explores the constraints that each of those local authorities face. A multiple case study approach was adopted that involved semi-structured interviews with both a policy planner and a consent planner from each of the following case study local authorities: Environment Canterbury, Otago Regional Council, Christchurch City Council, Dunedin City Council, Waimakariri District Council and Queenstown-Lakes District Council. These interviews provided a valuable insight into the practice of CEA at the local authority level, despite the limited generalisability of the case study approach. Literature surrounding the CEA process was reviewed throughout the research aspect of this dissertation, and the common themes and constraints of CEA practice were compared to form an evaluative framework that presented the findings. The findings showed that the primary approach adopted is the strategic setting of qualitative and quantitative standards through plans (both regional and district). There is a clear difference between the local authorities in the level of consideration that each gives to cumulative effects within their own various plans. From primary consideration at the plan development stage, down to the inclusion of specific rules and assessment matters and project level CEA. The lower the level of consideration within a plan {{the more likely it is}} that project level CEA is carried out hence more specific, detailed CEA is promoted. Throughout the local authorities studied, a range of methods for regulating adverse cumulative effects were adopted. A major weakness of practice is the lack of thresholds (or means) for determining when an increment will become significant and be ‘the straw that broke the camel’s back’. This determination of cumulative significance forms the crux of the difficulties surrounding CEA. The ‘case by case’ approach adopted by judicial determinations stemming from the RMA makes assessing individual applications for their contribution to cumulative effects a major challenge. Proving any cause-effect linkages of a significant cumulative effect is also difficult when dealing with small scale increments. The interpretation of the precedent effect and permitted baseline issues provide other factors that add to the complexity of CEA practice. The consideration of cumulative effects in plans down to the low policy level should be emphasised as a practical means of enhancing CEA by both <b>applicants</b> and local <b>authorities</b> when assessing applications. The use of checklists, specific to cumulative effects, should be promoted and adopted to ensure that sufficient consideration is being given to cumulative effects. Planning practitioners need guidance on the most effective approaches to adopt. As a result of this dissertation, it was concluded that the RMA should be amended in order to place a stronger emphasis on cumulative effects in both district and regional plans and assessments of environmental effects (AEEs). Research should be undertaken into the practical effectiveness of strategic tendering for resources susceptible to cumulative degradation, and also into the outcomes of the various approaches to CEA examined in this dissertation. CEA is a practice that needs to be constantly developed and reviewed in order to promote effective outcomes...|$|R
