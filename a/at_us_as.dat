[...] Donegan, commenting on the meaning of the title, stated, [...] "We feel that we've become indestructible to be able to survive this long in the business, and continuing a success with it." [...] Draiman concluded, [...] "We have been through a lot.

500|$|Underoath's {{members are}} Christian and {{have stated that}} they are a Christian band. However, as vocalist Spencer Chamberlain explains, [...] " [...] in a {{different}} way. We're not like your average Christian band." [...] He explains that Christianity is the [...] "backbone of our lives, especially in the way that we handle certain things, but it's not so much the backbone of our lyrics. It's not like every song is a lesson from the Bible or something. It's just normal life struggles." [...] Keyboardist Christopher Dudley stated that a majority of Underoath's audience is not Christian, nor are the bands with whom they would often tour. Though the band has been noted for [...] "setting precedent in both Christian rock and beyond", only a portion of their albums are sold in the Christian marketplace. Chamberlain said, [...] "I look <b>at</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> just another band in the secular market like with all these other hardcore bands and we just happen to be a Christian band that has different beliefs." [...] However, in an interview with Alternative Press, Drummer Aaron Gillespie stated that [...] "I'm definitely a Christian, but I don't think Underoath should be a 'Christian band'" ...|$|E
