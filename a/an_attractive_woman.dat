5|$|In March 1826, {{when she}} was 24, she formed a {{relationship}} with the 22-year-old William Corder. Marten was <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>woman</b> and relationships with men from the neighbourhood had already resulted in two children. One died as an infant, the child of William's older brother Thomas, but the other, Thomas Henry, was still alive at the time when Corder met her. Thomas Henry's father, Peter Matthews, did not marry Marten but regularly sent money to provide for the child.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>woman</b> with long black hair that covered a hole {{in the back of her}} neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E

25|$|Women {{have been}} found to find altruistic men to be {{attractive}} partners. When looking for a long-term partner, altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children. It has been shown that men perform altruistic acts {{in the early stages of}} a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>woman.</b> While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man. Men may even avoid altruistic women in short-term relationships which may be because they expect less success.|$|E

500|$|Sévérine {{attracted}} critical attention {{following her}} first appearances in promotion {{related to the}} film. She {{was in the first}} preview video for Skyfall, which showed her initial encounter with Bond in the Macau casino. The character and the black dress featured prominently on one of the film's posters. Sévérine is mostly absent from the trailer, which Marlohe attributed to keeping the character's storyline a [...] "surprise" [...] for viewers. Screen Crush's Mike Sampson described the preview as reminiscent of those of earlier James Bond films, where Bond says [...] "his classic introduction" [...] to <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>woman.</b> Sampson wrote that the conventional James Bond elements in the scene, and Sévérine's character, marked the promotion of Skyfall as a [...] "return to old school Bond [...] with a slightly modern feel". Den of Geek!'s Max Williams referenced the sequence as [...] "one beautiful encounter". However, Owen Vaughan of News.com.au responded negatively to Marlohe during the promotional interviews for Skyfall, writing that she acted [...] "robotic and awkward" [...] suggesting that she was not a strong actor.|$|E

500|$|Although shy and {{insecure}} as a teenager, as {{an adult}} Chamberlain became well known for his womanizing. As his lawyer Seymour [...] "Sy" [...] Goldberg put it: [...] "Some people collect stamps, Wilt collected women." [...] Swedish Olympic high jumper Annette Tånnander, who met {{him when he was}} 40 and she 19, remembers him as a pick-up artist who was extremely confident yet respectful: [...] "I think Wilt hit on everything that moved... he never was bad or rude." [...] Many of Chamberlain's personal friends testified that he once had 23 women in 10 days, had no problems organizing a threesome (or more), and particularly enjoyed a TV skit on the television show In Living Color in which a mother and her daughter approach a Vietnam Wall-like list of women who slept with him, both of them pointing out that their names are on it, as well as a 1991 Saturday Night Live sketch where MC Hammer played Chamberlain in [...] "Remembrances of Love", where Chamberlain spoofs a soap opera with romances with women that are usually over in five minutes. [...] However, Los Angeles Times columnist David Shaw claimed that during a dinner with Shaw and his wife, Chamberlain was [...] "rude and sexist toward his own date, as he usually was", adding that at one point Chamberlain left the table to get the phone number of <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>woman</b> at a nearby table.|$|E

500|$|Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone {{commented that}} the album, which starts with [...] " [...] {{cauldron}} of energy" [...] on [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003), ends by contrast with [...] "Daddy" [...] which he described as a five-minute tribute to her manager-father, and considered to be [...] "an anthology of vocal and lyrical cliches." [...] MTV News wrote that [...] "Daddy" [...] {{is different from the}} other relationship songs on Dangerously in Love, and added that it has a powerful message. By contrast, Allison Stewart of The Washington Post and Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times both called [...] "Daddy" [...] a [...] "creepy bonus track". Similarly, Spence D., writing for IGN Music stated that [...] "Daddy" [...] is not really worth uncovering, as it follows suit in terms of being [...] "a by-the-books contempo R rendition", and he commented that [...] "there is something oddly eerie about <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>woman</b> such as Beyoncé crooning the words 'I want my husband to be like my Daddy.'" [...] Mike Wass of the website Idolator called the song one of the [...] "duds" [...] on the album and added that it was a [...] "best forgotten ode to the superstar's father complete with stomach-churning lyrics like 'I want my husband to be like my daddy'". In 2014, Louis Virtel of the website HitFix reviewed the song negatively, calling it the worst on Dangerously in Love and describing its lyrics as [...] "seriously simplistic". [...] "Daddy" [...] peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot RingMasters charts in the United States in 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Oxytocin affects social {{distance}} between adult males and females, {{and may be}} responsible {{at least in part}} for romantic attraction and subsequent monogamous pair bonding. An oxytocin nasal spray caused men in a monogamous relationship, but not single men, to increase the distance between themselves and <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>woman</b> during a first encounter by 10 to 15 centimeters. The researchers suggested that oxytocin may help promote fidelity within monogamous relationships. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as the [...] "bonding hormone". There is some evidence that oxytocin promotes ethnocentric behavior, incorporating the trust and empathy of in-groups with their suspicion and rejection of outsiders. Furthermore, genetic differences in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) have been associated with maladaptive social traits such as aggressive behavior.|$|E
