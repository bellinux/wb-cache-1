25|$|The game's ending {{depends on}} how the player interacted with the Little Sisters, and the fates of non-player {{characters}} Holloway, Poole and Alexander within the game. Eleanor can save Sofia Lamb or allow her to die, {{depending on whether the}} player spared or executed the non-player characters. If Delta rescued all of the Little Sisters he will breathe his last breath in Eleanor's arms, the weather will be sunny and clean, then she will absorb his personality and memories and leave Rapture with the Little Sisters to change the world for the better, dropping the doll that one of the little sisters give her in the ocean, which slightly resembles Delta, in order to mourn his death, and to make his death count. If Delta harvested all of the Little Sisters then Eleanor will extract Delta's ADAM and become bent on world domination, the weather becoming dark and stormy as the corpses of Rapture's inhabitants float to the surface. A mix between rescuing and harvesting the little sisters gives the player a choice; either Eleanor can absorb his ADAM and become evil, or Delta can stop her and die, in which case Eleanor will mourn his death <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> own way in life.|$|E
