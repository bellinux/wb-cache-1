5000|$|<b>Agrostology</b> (from Greek , agr≈çstis, [...] "type of grass"; and , -logia), {{sometimes}} graminology, is {{the scientific}} study of the grasses (the family Poaceae, or Gramineae). The grasslike species of the sedge family (Cyperaceae), the rush family (Juncaceae), and the bulrush or cattail family (Typhaceae) are often included with the true grasses in the category of graminoid, although strictly speaking these are not included within the study of <b>agrostology.</b> In contrast to the word graminoid, the words gramineous and graminaceous are normally used to mean [...] "of, or relating to, the true grasses (Poaceae)".|$|E
5000|$|Charles Edward Hubbard CBE (23 May 1900 - 8 May 1980) was a British botanist, specialising in <b>agrostology</b> - {{the study}} of grasses. He was {{considered}} [...] "the world authority on the classification and recognition of grasses" [...] in his time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agrostology</b> has {{importance}} in the maintenance of wild and grazed grasslands, agriculture (crop plants such as rice, maize, sugarcane, and wheat are grasses, and many types of animal fodder are grasses), urban and environmental horticulture, turfgrass management and sod production, ecology, and conservation.|$|E

40|$|For {{some time}} past the Division of <b>Agrostology</b> has been {{conducting}} investigations {{in various parts of}} the United States with a view to the preservation of our native grasses, the introduction of new varieties, and the improvement of the ranges. The investigation in Texas, where the once fine ranges have been seriously injured or totally destroyed on account of the greed and carelessness of stockmen, is an important one. In his last report, the Secretary of Agriculture recommends that provisions be made for renting the public lands, suitable for grazing purposes, to stockmen and sheepmen for a number of years. By this means it is thought that the ranges will be preserved and improved; for then each individual who makes use of them will be financially interested in a definite tract for a sufficiently long time to warrant him taking the best care of it...|$|E

40|$|Indigofera zollingeriana {{is one of}} legumes has a great {{potential}} {{to be used as}} an animal feed having high quality nutrients and is tolerant to different environmental conditions. The objective of this experiment was to study the effect of different row spacings between individual plants on growth pattern, forage yield, and quality of I. zollingeriana. Field experiment was conducted at Field Laboratory of <b>Agrostology,</b> Faculty of Animal Science Bogor Agricultural University, during the growing season of 2015 / 2016. The 4 spacings levels used were 1 x 1. 5 m; 1 x 1 m; 1 x 0. 75 m; and 1 x 0. 5 m. The treatment was arranged in a completely randomized block design, with 4 replicates. Variables in this research were plant height, number of leaves, number of branches, plant population for each plot, fresh and dry matter yields, and forage quality. The results showed that narrow plant spacing increased plant height, plant population, fresh and dry weights, dry matter yields, as well as NDF and Œ≤-carotene contents. The wider the plant spacing the greater the number of branches and leaves per plant. It was concluded that increasing plant population by narrowing plant spacing remained {{the most effective way to}} increase Indigofera forage yield without negative effects of it on nutritive values, i. e., crude protein, crude fat, crude fiber, ADF, and TDN...|$|E
