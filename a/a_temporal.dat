However, all the original features are preserved in that of the tuatara; it has two openings – <b>a</b> <b>temporal</b> fenestra {{on each side of}} the skull, with complete arches. In addition, the upper jaw is firmly attached to the skull. This makes for a very rigid, inflexible construction. Testudines (turtles and tortoises) have anapsid skulls – they lack any temporal fenestrae, are sometimes considered to be the most primitive among amniotes, though evidence strongly indicates they may have lost the temporal openings rather than never having had them.|$|E

Through morphic fields, she connected to Junpei in the future, witnessing several possible realities and directing Junpei to help him survive. Junpei then faces the same sudoku puzzle Akane did, and relays the solution back to Akane in the past, allowing her to escape with Seven and the other children. Junpei realizes that Akane was Zero and, with assistance from Santa, had recreated the game and all the events she had witnessed in order to ensure her survival and avoid <b>a</b> <b>temporal</b> paradox. As Junpei {{and the others}} escape, they discover that the game had taken place in Building Q the entire time, and that Akane and Santa have fled, leaving behind a car with Ace restrained in the trunk.

The party fix the Mystic War by retrieving the Masamune from Kasmir and putting it back in antiquity. In 1005A.D., new diplomatic talks are about to begin. Porre instead launches an assault, backed by King Zeal and Dalton, placed in Porre's high command by the king. King Guardia dies in the attack. The party venture to 11,995B.C. once more with Schala, intent on striking the Frozen Flame in antiquity to lure out King Zeal. This unleashes wild energies, and the party must overcome individual mental assaults by the Flame.

25|$|Craig {{examines}} arguments {{aimed at}} showing either that God is timeless or omnitemporal. He defends the coherence of a timeless and personal being, but {{says that the}} arguments for divine timelessness are unsound or inconclusive. By contrast, he gives two {{arguments in favor of}} divine temporality. First, he says that if <b>a</b> <b>temporal</b> world exists, then in virtue of his real relations to that world, God cannot remain untouched by its temporality. Craig says that given God's changing relations with the world he must change at least extrinsically, which is sufficient for his existing temporally. Second, Craig says that if <b>a</b> <b>temporal</b> world exists, then in virtue of his omniscience, God must know tensed facts about the world, such as what is happening now, which Craig argues is sufficient for his being temporally located. Craig argues that, since <b>a</b> <b>temporal</b> world does exist, it follows that God exists in time.|$|E
