40|$|This paper {{presents}} interim {{results from}} a CFD based investigation to quantify the sensitivities of furnace operational conditions including NOx emissions and unburned carbon on fly ash to imbalances in burner combustion <b>air</b> and <b>coal</b> flow rates in coal fired boilers. This paper presents comparative results for four boilers, including a 150 MW wall fired unit, 500 MW opposed wall fired unit, a 600 MW tangentially fired unit, and a 350 MW cyclone fired unit. However, this paper focuses on the sensitivity study conducted for a 350 MW cyclone furnace. The parametric cases involve specified variations in <b>coal</b> and secondary <b>air</b> flow rates to each of seven cyclone barrels. CFD predicted impacts of these variations on furnace exit NOx, CO, gas temperature, and unburned carbon on fly ash are presented. Sensitivity coefficients have been computed in order to quantify the dependencies of the furnace conditions on secondary <b>air</b> and <b>coal</b> variations to each cyclone barrel. These results provide a strategy for quantifying the expected variation in NOx emissions {{as a function of}} prescribed variability in secondary <b>air</b> and <b>coal</b> flow rates between the seven cyclone barrels. This information can be utilized to estimate the benefits of individual cyclone barrel secondary <b>air</b> and <b>coal</b> flow controls.

40|$|This is {{a policy}} {{analysis}} of the proposed Gateway Pacific Terminal and its potential environmental and economic impacts on Bellingham, Washington and the greater Puget Sound region.

As a consequence, the amount of rail line traffic would increase. An additional eighteen trains a day, up from the usual seven, would pass through the city that would cut off businesses major intersections.

40|$|Background: Indoor {{pollution}} can be {{an important}} risk factor for human health, considering that people spend more than 60 % of their time in their houses. Aim: To investigate indoor pollution in a zone of extreme poverty in Metropolitan Santiago. Material and methods: During 24 h, carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), respirable particulate matter (PM 10), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons absorbed in PM 5, temperature and humidity, were measured in the interior of 24 houses in La Pintana, Santiago. Results: The higher pollutant concentrations were observed during hours when heating was used, in houses that used coal (mean PM 10 250 µg/m 3, CO 42 ppm, SO 2 192 ppb) or firewood (mean PM 10 489 µg/m 3, CO 57 ppm, SO 2 295 ppb). In all houses, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were detected and they came from the interior of the house and not from external filtered <b>air.</b> <b>Coal,</b> firewood and cigarette smoke were important sources of carcinogenic and kerosene and gas were sources of non carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Conclusions: In the houses studied, the population was exposed to an accumulation of highly toxic pollutants, caused by a lack of ventilation.

40|$|Abstract: Since {{the finding}} in the 1930 s, {{a large number of}} {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of different structures have been tested for potential tumorigenicity. Structure-activity relationships of halo-PAHs have been investigated to determine the regions of a PAH that may be involved in cancer initiation. From these studies, a number of halo-PAHs were found to be tumorigenic in experimental animals. It was not until the 1980 s that halo-PAHs were found to be present in the environment, including municipal incinerator fly ash, urban <b>air,</b> <b>coal</b> combustion, soil, snow, automobile exhausts, and tap water. Due to their widespread presence in the environment and their genotoxic activities, including carcinogenicity, many of these compounds may pose a health risk to humans. Although the biological activities, including metabolism, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity, of halo-PAHs have been studied their phototoxicity and photo-induced biological activity have not been well examined. In this study, we study the photoirradiation of a series of structure-related halo-PAHs by UVA light {{in the presence of a}} lipid, methyl linoleate, and determine as to whether or not these compounds can induce lipid peroxidation.

40|$|Fluorides, {{hydrogen}} fluoride, and fluorine {{have been}} identified in at least 188 of the 1, 636 hazardous waste sites that have been proposed for inclusion on the EPA National Priorities List (NPL) (HazDat 2003). However, the number of sites evaluated for fluorides, hydrogen fluoride, and fluorine is not known. The frequency of these sites can be seen in Figure 6 - 1. Of these sites, all are located within the United States. Fluorides are naturally-occurring components of rocks and soil and are also found in air, water, plants, and animals. They enter the atmosphere through volcanic emissions and the resuspension of soil by wind. Volcanoes also emit hydrogen fluoride and some fluorine gas. Fluorine is a highly reactive element and readily hydrolyzes to form hydrogen fluoride and oxygen. Hydrogen fluoride reacts with many materials both in the vapor phase and in aerosols. The resultant fluorides are typically nonvolatile, stable compounds. Marine aerosols also release small amounts of gaseous hydrogen fluoride and fluoride salts into the air (Friend 1989). Anthropogenic fluoride emissions include the combustion of fluorine-containing materials, which releases hydrogen fluoride, as well as particulate fluorides, into the <b>air.</b> <b>Coal</b> contains small amounts of fluorine, and coal-fired power plants constitute the largest source of anthropogenic hydrogen fluoride emissions.

40|$|It is well {{understood}} that the stability of axial diffusion flames {{is dependent on the}} mixing behavior of the fuel and combustion air streams. Combustion aerodynamic texts typically describe flame stability and transitions from laminar diffusion flames to fully developed turbulent flames as a function of increasing jet velocity. Turbulent diffusion flame stability is greatly influenced by recirculation eddies that transport hot combustion gases back to the burner nozzle. This recirculation enhances mixing and heats the incoming gas streams. Models describing these recirculation eddies utilize conservation of momentum and mass assumptions. Increasing the mass flow rate of either fuel or combustion air increases both the jet velocity and momentum for a fixed burner configuration. Thus, differentiating between gas velocity and momentum is important when evaluating flame stability under various operating conditions. The research efforts described herein are part of an ongoing project directed at evaluating the effect of flame aerodynamics on NO{sub x} emissions from coal fired burners in a systematic manner. This research includes both experimental and modeling efforts being performed at the University of Arizona in collaboration with Purdue University. The objective of this effort is to develop rational design tools for optimizing low NO{sub x} burners. Experimental studies include both cold-and hot-flow evaluations of the following parameters: primary and secondary inlet air velocity, coal concentration in the primary <b>air,</b> <b>coal</b> particle size distribution and flame holder geometry. Hot-flow experiments will also evaluate the effect of wall temperature on burner performance...|$|E

40|$|Emissions {{of mercury}} (Hg) and their control are a {{well-known}} problem for conventional coal combustion power plants {{but they still}} represent a challenge for relatively new technologies such as the oxy-combustion. In oxy-fuel combustion systems {{it is important that}} Hg be in its oxidized form (Hg 2 +) because in the form of elemental mercury (Hg 0), it can damage the CO 2 compression units. In conventional air combustion some catalysts used in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx could also co-benefit Hg oxidation. This study evaluates the oxidation of Hg in the presence of several SCR catalysts under an oxy-combustion atmosphere focusing on the main differences with conventional <b>air</b> <b>coal</b> combustion. In the experimental conditions of this study, a higher mercury oxidation was observed in the CO 2 -enriched atmosphere {{due to the fact that}} in this atmosphere the conversion of NOx was lower, which resulted in a higher concentration of NO and NO 2 free to homogeneously oxidize mercury. In oxy-combustion conditions the high amount of CO 2 and H 2 O present may block the active sites for mercury adsorption. Moreover, the differences between the active sites of catalysts based on V/W/TiO 2 and Fe/Zeolite with/without Mn as doping agent were eclipsed by the effect of the flue gas composition.
