5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms <b>and</b> <b>signs</b> of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin).

2500|$|Research {{studying}} {{the acquisition of}} both spoken <b>and</b> <b>sign</b> language also lends support to this theory. [...] A study examining the acquisition of both spoken <b>and</b> <b>sign</b> language by children of deaf parents indicated that the children acquired both languages {{in the same manner}} as children learning two spoken languages. [...] Moreover, the study indicated that bilingual children, including those learning both spoken <b>and</b> <b>sign</b> language, were able to acquire various linguistic concepts at the same rate as monolinguistic children. [...] While bilingual children tend to include mixed language in their speech, children acquiring both spoken <b>and</b> <b>sign</b> language have shown indications of simultaneous language mixing by both speaking <b>and</b> <b>signing</b> certain words together. [...] Though it is only possible to observe this type of language mixing when the child is learning both spoken <b>and</b> <b>sign</b> language, it provides support for the Dual Language System Hypothesis, indicating that the simultaneous operation of separate two language systems could be a cause of language mixing by bilingual children.|$|R

5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms <b>and</b> <b>signs</b> of the infection.

They head to the location, descending into corridors covered in alien secretions.|$|E
