5|$|Some {{concerns}} {{have also been}} expressed regarding the effects of cordon area congestion pricing on economic activity <b>and</b> <b>land</b> <b>use,</b> as the benefits are usually evaluated from the urban transportation perspective only.

40|$|Road {{development}} is a costly affair, thus {{it is imperative to}} plan it properly. One aspect of planning is by determining the effects of <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> on road development or viceâ€“versa. This study attempts to functionally link road development <b>and</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> using two towns, i. e. Johor Bahru and Sungai Petani, as samples. Road development, the dependent variable, is represented by road density; <b>and</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> are represented by 15 variables encompassing households, employment and property components. The multivariate regression model for these two cities shows that a parsimonious model is possible to adequately describe the relationship between road density <b>and</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses.</b> However, evidence indicates that a separate regression model as a common, single model for the whole nation is not possible. ...|$|R

5|$|The largest {{threat to}} the {{ecosystem}} is grazing by feral sheep (Ovis aries), cattle (Bos primigenius), and goats (Capra hircus) introduced to the island in the late 18th century. Feral animal competition with commercial grazing was severe enough that a program to eradicate them existed {{as far back as}} the late 1920s, and continued through to 1949. One of the results of this grazing was the increased prevalence of herbaceous and woody plants, both endemic and introduced, that were resistant to browsing. The feral animals were almost eradicated, and numbered a few hundred in the 1950s. However, an influx of local hunters led to the feral species being valued as game animals, and in 1959 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, the governing body in charge of conservation <b>and</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> management, changed its policy to a sustained-control program designed to facilitate the sport.|$|E
5|$|Zoning <b>and</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> controversies, common {{throughout}} Bellaire's history, {{resulted in}} the 1977 recall of the mayor and three council members. The City of Bellaire voted against banning smoking in bars and restaurants on Monday January 15, 2007. Mayor Cindy Siegel and Pat McLaughlan, one council member, voted for the ban, while the other five members, including Peggy Faulk, voted against the ban. The National Restaurant Association asked Bellaire to consider adopting a smoking ban {{to put it in}} sync with the City of Houston, which adopted a similar ordinance in 2005. In December 2009 the city voted to ban texting while driving. Bans of texting while driving were passed in Bellaire and West University Place, Texas within hours of one another. In 2010 the city voted 5-2 to ban the feeding of cats on public property and establish a rule requiring the permission of the owner of a piece of private property in order to feed cats on private property. The city received negative e-mail feedback from various locations, including Switzerland.|$|E

40|$|In {{urban and}} rural areas under rapid urbanization, a proper {{understanding}} of the relationship between population <b>and</b> construction <b>land</b> <b>use</b> is important for regional sustainable development. The decoupling method is a particularly useful way to examine this relationship. However, the decoupling method only considers the current relationship between population <b>and</b> construction <b>land,</b> ignoring the initial status in the base year. Based on an improved decoupling model, vector land-use data (1 : 10, 000 scale) from two National <b>Land</b> Investigations, <b>and</b> demographic data from the China Statistics Bureau, this paper analyzes population <b>and</b> construction <b>land</b> <b>use</b> change patterns as well as the types of coupling in {{urban and rural}} Hubei. The results better reflect the relationship between population <b>and</b> construction <b>land</b> <b>use.</b> The outcomes show that from 2009 to 2014, both the urban population <b>and</b> urban construction <b>land</b> <b>use</b> increased while the rural population decreased as rural settlement <b>land</b> <b>use</b> expanded. In 61 counties, the relationship between the urban population <b>and</b> construction <b>land</b> <b>use</b> showed expansive negative decoupling; that is, the growth rate of urban population was less than the growth rate of the urban construction <b>land</b> <b>use.</b> In 72 counties, the relationship between the rural population <b>and</b> rural settlement <b>land</b> showed a strong negative decoupling; that is, the rural population decreased while the rural settlement <b>land</b> <b>use</b> increased. The relationship between the urban–rural population <b>and</b> construction <b>land</b> <b>use</b> can be divided into eight types. Only nine counties are somewhat coordinated, while the other counties were all uncoordinated. Suggestions are provided by comparing per capita urban construction <b>land</b> <b>and</b> per capita rural settlement land in the base and current years with the national standard and considering the coupling types for population <b>and</b> construction <b>land</b> <b>use</b> change in urban and rural settings. Finally, we discuss approaches to optimize urban–rural space organization and promote coordinated urban–rural development...|$|R
