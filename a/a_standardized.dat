5|$|In 2015, Asperger's was {{estimated}} to affect 37.2 million people globally. The syndrome is named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger who, in 1944, described children in his practice who lacked nonverbal communication, had limited understanding of others' feelings, and were physically clumsy. The modern conception of Asperger syndrome came into existence in 1981 and went {{through a period of}} popularization. It became <b>a</b> <b>standardized</b> diagnosis in the early 1990s. Many questions and controversies remain about aspects of the disorder. There is doubt about whether it is distinct from high-functioning autism (HFA). Partly because of this, the percentage of people affected is not firmly established.|$|E

5|$|The First World War {{also saw}} the birth of aerial warfare, {{and with it the}} need not only to conceal {{positions}} and vehicles from being spotted from the air, but also the need to camouflage the aircraft themselves. In 1917, Germany started using a lozenge camouflage covering Central Powers aircraft, possibly the earliest printed camouflage. A similarly disruptive splinter pattern in earth tones, Buntfarbenanstrich 1918, was introduced for tanks in 1918, and was also used on the Stahlhelm (steel helmet), becoming the first use of <b>a</b> <b>standardized</b> camouflage pattern for soldiers.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} {{the promotional}} period, Burger King {{received}} numerous complaints from fans of Chicken Fries through social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. One of the major ways the company responded was through personalized responses to these posts. Instead of using an automated response that would paste <b>a</b> <b>standardized</b> message on people's Twitter feeds, the company instead employed several staff to personally respond to customers voicing displeasure on the LTO nature of the 2014 introduction. The entire 2014 Chicken Fries promotion represented a major shift in the attitude towards advertising for Burger King, moving from a more traditional advertising structure to one focused almost entirely on digitally-based media. This change happened fairly quickly, falling into place over the twelve to eighteen-month period preceding the reintroduction of Chicken Fries to the chain's menu. Along with the new advertising firm, a new director of digital marketing and social media was newly hired from cosmetics firm L'Oréal was added, increasing the clout of the digital advertising team within the chain.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of development, Nihilistic wanted to support editing of the game by the user-community, having seen the {{benefits}} to the community while working on other games. Staff who worked on Jedi Knight knew the experience of creating a new, customized programming language called COG that gave the programmers the results they wanted but cost time and significant project resources. With Redemption, they wanted to incorporate an existing scripting engine that would more easily enable users to further develop the game instead of developing their own code again, which would consume months of development time. The team tested various languages, but became aware of another studio, Rebel Boat Rocker, which was receiving attention for its use of the Java language. Speaking to that studio's lead programmer Billy Zelsnak, Nihilistic decided to experiment with Java, having little prior knowledge of it. The language successfully integrated into the NOD engine without problems, providing <b>a</b> <b>standardized</b> and freely distributable scripting engine. Several designers were trained to use Java {{to allow them to}} build the several hundred scripts required to drive the game's storyline.|$|E

The Philippine constitution provides {{for the promotion of}} Spanish and Arabic on a voluntary and optional basis, although neither are used on as wide a scale as in the past. Spanish, which was widely used as a lingua franca in the late nineteenth century, has since declined greatly in use, but is experiencing revival due to government promotions, while Arabic is mainly used in Islamic schools in Mindanao. However, Spanish loanwords are still present today in many of the indigenous Philippine languages.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, McMaster's School of Medicine adopted {{progress}} testing, {{developing the}} personal progress index (PPI), a {{system based on}} progress testing invented concurrently by the University of Missouri-Kansas City's medical school and the Maastricht University. The PPI is used as an objective method for assessing acquisition and retention of knowledge for students in the medical program. The PPI is administered at regular intervals to {{all students in the}} program, regardless of their level of training, and plots students' scores as they move through the program. Students typically score 20 percent on their first examination, and increase by five to seven percent with each successive examination. Students can monitor the changes in their scores and receive formative feedback based on <b>a</b> <b>standardized</b> score relative to the class mean. Due to the overwhelming success and research supporting the use of the PPI as an evaluation tool, it is now used in Canada, US, Europe, and Australia.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWith {{increasing}} innovational {{dynamics and}} shorter product and technology lifecycles, companies {{are facing a}} huge number of production ramp-ups in shorter times at a higher complexity. To cope with these challenges, methods and tools are required to reduce instabilities during production ramp-ups and to enable a smooth and stable ramp-up curve. One solution approach is the application of factory standards. <b>As</b> <b>standardized</b> product architectures are already state of the art for many companies, standardized factory structures are the next step towards <b>an</b> overall <b>standardized</b> production architecture. The approach of factory standards and its benefits especially during ramp-up will be introduced in this paper...|$|R

5|$|In {{the absence}} of <b>a</b> <b>standardized</b> {{diagnosis}} system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships {{can contribute to the}} cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E
5|$|Several scales {{exist to}} grade the {{severity}} of acne vulgaris, but no single technique has been universally accepted as the diagnostic standard. Cook's acne grading scale uses photographs to grade severity from 0 to 8 (0 being the least severe and 8 being the most severe). This scale {{was the first to}} use <b>a</b> <b>standardized</b> photographic protocol to assess acne severity; since its creation in 1979, the scale has undergone several revisions. The Leeds acne grading technique counts acne lesions on the face, back, and chest and categorizes them as inflammatory or non-inflammatory. Leeds scores range from 0 (least severe) to 10 (most severe) though modified scales have a maximum score of 12. The Pillsbury acne grading scale simply classifies {{the severity of}} the acne from 1 (least severe) to 4 (most severe).|$|E
5|$|The {{brightness}} of a star, {{as seen from}} Earth, is measured with <b>a</b> <b>standardized,</b> logarithmic scale. This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing {{brightness of}} the star. The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest, Sirius, is of magnitude −1.46. To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths. Thus, for many years, Vega {{was used as a}} baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales. However, this is no longer the case, as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux. This approach is more convenient for astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration.|$|E

5|$|The {{postwar period}} saw {{considerable}} deflation; {{the shortage of}} labor and materials during the war had led to much higher wages and prices, and in the postwar economic readjustment, wages were cut heavily. In Chicago, employers in the building trades attempted a 20%wage cut; when this {{was rejected by the}} unions, a lockout followed. Both sides agreed to submit the matter to a neutral arbitrator, and settled on Landis, who agreed to take the case in June 1921. By this time, Landis was Commissioner of Baseball, and still a federal judge. In September, Landis issued his report, cutting wages by an average of 12.5%. To improve productivity, he also struck restrictions on machinery which saved labor, established <b>a</b> <b>standardized</b> overtime rate, and resolved jurisdictional conflicts between unions. The labor organizations were not completely satisfied, but Landis's reforms were adopted in many places across the country and were credited with reviving the building industry.|$|E
