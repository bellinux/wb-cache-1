40|$|Breach of {{warranty}} - Waiver by estoppel - <b>Affirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> - Misrepresentation - Damages The facts In March 2003 {{the floating}} casino Copa Casino, owned by Argo (claimant) and insured by Liberty (defendant), became {{a total loss}} while being towed from the US Gulf to India. Argo claimed against Liberty, but the claim was declined in July 2003. Litigation started in May 2004 in the Alabama court in the United States, where the court decided {{that it had no}} jurisdiction over the case against Liberty and dismissed the claim against the insurance brokers, DSI, on the merits. In February 2009 proceedings started in England. <br/...|$|E
40|$|This article {{makes an}} overdue attempt to rationalise {{the notion of}} 2 ̆ 7 {{election}} 2 ̆ 7 as applied by Anglo-Australian courts. It addresses a fundamental paradox in existing English and Australian law: while ostensibly resisting any effort to bring all election cases under a general theory, Anglo-Australian courts conceptualise an election in a way little short of radical, holding it invariably as a unilateral, informed choice between inconsistent options, which in itself furnishes a distinct legal basis for the irrevocability of such a choice. The article suggests that all election cases must be united under a general theory, but this theory should not be given the normative force the law currently espouses. It substantiates this suggestion {{by way of a}} critical review of two well-established categories of election at common law and concludes that disaffirmation and <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> are acts of distinct natures and cannot be accommodated under the same notion; election is ill-suited for determining whether a choice to sue an undisclosed principal or its agent is binding. In both cases it is estoppel, rather than election, that holds the best promise to justify, if at all, the irrevocability of the choice made. Consequently, the normative conception of election should be discarded and the general theory be reformulated in descriptive terms, parting with irrevocability as one of its essential elements...|$|E

50|$|In the District Court, it {{was ruled}} the solicitors letter {{amounted}} to <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract.</b> However, on appeal, the High Court {{ruled that the}} contents of the letter could have been interpreted in numerous ways, setting aside the affirmation ruling, and instead ruling that the defects involved were substantial in nature, and that McGuigan was entitled to cancel the contract, and was duly awarded a refund of his deposit.|$|R
40|$|Part 1 of {{this article}} is {{published}} at [2010] New Zealand Law Review 37. It considered various troubling or unsettled features of the common law election doctrine as it applies distinctively to the choice between affirming and disaffirming a contract. The present Part 2 of the article turns to examine the difficult and controversial question of the necessary mental componentry of an effective (hence binding) election to affirm, {{in the light of the}} well-recognised, but problematical, contemporary distinction between “actual” election and “imputed” election. It is ultimately argued that <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>contract</b> by way <b>of</b> election must involve the unambiguous communication of an actual and conscious decision not to disaffirm the particular contract in question. Otherwise, the conditions of a limited conception of “imputed election”, described and developed herein, must be satisfied. According to that limited conception, an election to affirm may be imputed without proof of an actual intention to elect, but never without knowledge, actual or constructive, of the available legal alternatives between which the party in question is claimed to have elected. However, this limited conception of imputed election is further narrowed by a parsimonious comprehension of the circumstances under which “constructive knowledge” of a disaffirmation power can fairly be ascribed to the power-holding party contrary to the truth. Cases falling outside of such a restrictive conception of imputed election must be administered according to some legal preclusionary department other than election — for example, estoppel or laches...|$|R
5000|$|Peter Robinson's {{literary}} criticism began to gain national attention when Donald Davie reviewed In the Circumstances: About Poems and Poets (1992) in the London Review of Books noting that 'Robinson deserves every credit for forcing {{his way into}} the thickets.' Poetry, Poets, Readers: Making Things Happen (2002) was welcomed by Andrea Brady in Poetry Review when she remarked that 'The conviction, pleasures and gratitude of committed reading are evident in this <b>affirmation</b> <b>of</b> the poetic <b>contract</b> between readers and writers.'Angela Leighton summed up his critical contribution in her review for the Times Literary Supplement of Twentieth Century Poetry: Selves and Situations (2005) when she wrote that 'Robinson has been a generous promoter of contemporary poetry for decades, and this collection of essays bears witness to his dedication and energy. He writes with an unformulaic enthusiasm, moving easily from biographical, political and poetic context to the nitty-gritty of close reading, while also striking an easy, readable tone'. Five years later, in the same journal, Justin Quinn found that Poetry & Translation: The Art of the Impossible (2010) was 'Vigorously and wittily argued ... an excellent and provocative contribution to a complex debate.' ...|$|R
