5|$|As {{the ships}} are {{prepared}} Sati {{gives birth to}} Kartik, her son with Shiva. The journey to Branga starts, with Sati staying back at Kashi to help the King with a lion attack on the local villagers. When Sati and her soldiers {{are on the verge}} of losing against the lions, a group of Naga soldiers led by a man and a woman arrive and assist them in killing the lions. The Naga woman reveals herself to be Kali, Sati's twin sister. She was denounced by their father Daksha since she was born with deformities, including two extra, functioning hands. The man reveals himself as Ganesh, Sati's first child, whom she believed to have died at child birth. Since Ganesh was also born with deformities, which led to his face resembling that of an elephant’s, Daksha denounced him <b>and</b> <b>lied</b> to Sati. Both Kali and Ganesh are brought back to Kashi by Sati and they wait for Shiva's arrival.|$|E
5|$|Athena was the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' {{mentor and}} ally {{throughout}} the Greek {{era in the}} series. In Chains of Olympus, Athena initially tasked Kratos to find Helios as {{in the absence of}} light, the god Morpheus had caused many of the gods to fall into a deep slumber. In God of War, she gave Kratos the mission of killing Ares, as Zeus had forbidden divine involvement, and was instrumental in allowing Kratos to become the new God of War. Although she begged Kratos to stop his second quest for the Ambrosia of Asclepius in the God of War comic series <b>and</b> <b>lied</b> to him about his brother Deimos in Ghost of Sparta, Athena was still sympathetic towards Kratos even after he renounced the gods and was betrayed by Zeus in God of War II. Athena died trying to protect Zeus from Kratos, and was resurrected and elevated to a new level of understanding in God of War III. With ulterior motives, Athena became Kratos' ally once more and guided him to the Flame of Olympus surrounding Pandora's Box, which allowed Kratos to kill Zeus and end the reign of Mount Olympus.|$|E

5|$|After {{the ambush}} the two {{apparent}} shooters {{ran from the}} buildings and fled in a Ford sedan; the car was later discovered to have been set on fire and destroyed. Aiello's body was loaded into the taxicab and taken to Garfield Park Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The coroner eventually removed 59 bullets, weighing over a pound, from the body. He was shot more times than any single victim of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. A third machine gun position, which was ultimately not used, was later discovered by police in another nearby building, which had been rented {{a week before the}} murder by a man who gave the name Lon Celespe. Police, prosecutors and federal agents immediately and publicly speculated that Capone was behind the assassination, noting that the precision machine-gun ambush was typical of his attacks. However, at least one press story at the time speculated Moran could have been behind the hit. Prestogiacomo, fearful for his life, went into hiding for three days after Aiello's death before turning himself in to police. He was charged as an accessory before the fact of Aiello's murder, a charge also filed against John Sorce, an employee of Aiello's importing company. Detectives questioned whether Prestogiacomo provided Aiello's enemies with information about his whereabouts, something he vehemently denied. Police claimed Prestogiacomo was not cooperative <b>and</b> <b>lied</b> about his relationship with Aiello. The charges against Prestogiacomo went to a grand jury but were ultimately dropped. Frank Nitti was also wanted by police for questioning in connection with the murder.|$|E
5|$|Before his trial, Tony {{attempts}} suicide. Whitney {{tries to}} visit but is refused, and Bianca {{sees it as}} a form of manipulation. Tony repeatedly attempts to contact Whitney by phone, but after {{the first day of the}} trial, he flushes the SIM card down the toilet in his cell. When Whitney's brother Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her witness statement was a lie and she was forced to say it. Bianca explains to Whitney that Tony will be set free and that he will target other children. Tony's barrister, Mrs Taylor (Jacqueline Defferary), cross-examines Whitney, trying to imply that she pursued him for several years, saying she refused to take 'no' for an answer <b>and</b> <b>lied</b> about the accusations. Tony shouts out that he is innocent but Whitney says she trusted him and he abused her, revealing the truth about the relationship. After leaving the courtroom, Whitney gives her barrister, Vivien Easley QC (Geraldine Alexander), a mobile phone with messages from Tony on it. A week later Tony is found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 13 years in custody. He smirks as the verdict is being read out but is taken away with his head in his hands.|$|E

25|$|Everyone {{agreed with}} Su Ze. With support from Zhang Ji, the Inspector of Yong Province, and Zhang Gong (張恭), the Chief Clerk of Dunhuang, Su Ze started {{launching}} military operations {{to suppress the}} rebellions. He first led his troops to Wuwei Commandery to assist Guanqiu Xing in putting down the unrest caused by the local tribes. After pacifying Wuwei Commandery, he joined forces with Guanqiu Xing to attack Zhang Jin in Zhangye Commandery. When Qu Yan heard about it, he led 3,000 men to meet Su Ze <b>and</b> <b>lied</b> {{that he wanted to}} surrender while secretly plotting to incite a mutiny. Su Ze saw through Qu Yan's lies, lured him into a trap and executed him. The rebels fled when they saw that Qu Yan was dead. Su Ze then gathered his allies, attacked Zhangye Commandery together, and defeated and killed Zhang Jin. The other rebels surrendered. When Huang Hua learnt that Qu Yan and Zhang Jin had been defeated and killed, he became fearful and surrendered to Su Ze. The rebellions thus came to an end. Su Ze returned to Jincheng Commandery in triumph. As a reward for his contributions, Su Ze was elevated from the status of a Secondary Marquis to a Marquis of a Chief Village (都亭侯) and given a marquisate of 300 taxable households.|$|E

Wendy Richard commented, [...] "It was not just the memory of Arthur that stopped the marriage to Joe being a success. He was proven to be a weak and untruthful man.

500|$|The symphony is scored for a {{very large}} orchestra, in keeping with Mahler's {{conception}} of the work as a [...] "new symphonic universe", a synthesis of symphony, cantata, oratorio, motet, <b>and</b> <b>lied</b> in a combination of styles. La Grange comments: [...] "To give expression to his cosmic vision, it was... necessary to go beyond all previously known limits and dimensions." [...] The orchestral forces required are, however, not as large as those deployed in Arnold Schoenberg's oratorio Gurre-Lieder, completed in 1911. The string section is conventional in that it contains violins divided, violas, cellos, and double basses. The woodwind section includes two piccolos (one doubling 5th flute), four flutes, four oboes, an English horn, three B clarinets, an E clarinet, a B bass clarinet, four bassoons and a contrabassoon. The brass section requires eight horns, four trumpets, four trombones, tuba and an offstage ensemble of four trumpets and three trombones. The percussion forces consist of timpani, cymbals, bass drum, tamtam, triangle, 2 low-pitched bells in A and A and glockenspiel. Other instruments include an organ, a harmonium, a piano, two harps (although at least four are preferred), a celesta, and a mandolin. Mahler recommended that in very large halls, the first player {{in each of the}} woodwind sections should be doubled and that numbers in the strings should also be augmented.|$|E

500|$|Many {{scholars}} {{believe that}} Marco Polo exaggerated his importance in China. The British historian David Morgan thought that Polo had likely exaggerated <b>and</b> <b>lied</b> about his status in China, while Ronald Latham believed that such exaggerations were embellishments by his ghost writer Rustichello da Pisa. In The Book of Marvels, Polo {{claimed that he}} was a close friend and advisor to Kublai Khan and that he was the governor of the city of Yangzhou for three years – yet no Chinese source mentions him as either a friend of the Emperor or as the governor of Yangzhou – indeed no Chinese source mentions Marco Polo at all. [...] Herbert Franke noted that all occurrences of Po-lo or Bolod (an Altaic word meaning [...] "steel") in Yuan texts were names of people of Mongol or Turkic extraction. The sinologist Paul Pelliot thought that Polo might have served as an officer of the government salt monopoly in Yangzhou, which was a position of some significance that could explain the exaggeration. Polo also claimed to have provided the Mongols with technical advice on building mangonels during the Siege of Xiangyang, a claim that cannot possibly be true as the siege was over before Polo had arrived in China. The Mongol army that besieged Xiangyang did have foreign military engineers, but they were mentioned in Chinese sources as being from Baghdad and had Arabic names.|$|E

Though this and Finn's temporary ouster from the football team test their relationship, it remains quite strong through the beginning of season two; the two work together to throw the glee club's duets competition so newcomer Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) wins instead.

500|$|Gibbes {{handed over}} command of No.3 Squadron to Squadron Leader Brian Eaton on 19April 1943.

While in England he converted to de Havilland Mosquito night fighters and was slated to command No.464 Squadron RAAF, but was instead posted back to Australia, via Canada. There, according to Gibbes, {{he gave a}} series of morale-building lectures on air combat to Empire Air Training Scheme students: [...] "So I, you know, went round <b>and</b> <b>lied</b> like hell.

He worked with Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring ace, to improve the success rate at No.2 OTU by personally selecting the most promising pilots from local service flying training schools. Gibbes was promoted to temporary wing commander on 1July. In October he was posted to Darwin in the Northern Territory, flying Supermarine Spitfires as wing leader of No.80 Wing. The role made him deputy to Group Captain Caldwell, the wing's commanding officer. Gibbes later suffered burns in a crash landing following engine failure. In December he met, in his own words, [...] "a little dark-haired popsy" [...] named Jeannine Ince, a volunteer with the Red Cross who had nursed him in hospital. They married on 23January 1945.|$|E
