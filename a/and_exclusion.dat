5|$|Citing Hirabayashi, Chief Justice Stone {{wrote the}} opinion of the court, and {{determined}} that the curfew <b>and</b> <b>exclusion</b> orders were valid, even as applied to citizens of the United States. Stone’s opinion was three pages and did not contain any concurring opinions or dissents, while the Hirabayashi decision had thirty-four pages and two concurring opinions. In Yasui the court affirmed his conviction of the misdemeanor, but ordered re-sentencing since the lower court had determined that the curfew was not valid, and that Yasui had forfeited his citizenship. The Supreme Court remanded (returned) the case back to the district court to determine a sentence in light of these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{settlement}} {{was taking place}} in Poland since very early times. In 1264, Duke Bolesław the Pious of Greater Poland granted the privileges of the Statute of Kalisz, which specified {{a broad range of}} freedoms of religious practices, movement, and trading for the Jews. It also created a legal precedent for the official protection of Jews from local harassment <b>and</b> <b>exclusion.</b> The act exempted the Jews from enslavement or serfdom and was the foundation of future Jewish prosperity in the Polish kingdom; it was later followed by many other comparable legal pronouncements. Following a series of expulsions of Jews from Western Europe, Jewish communities were established in Kraków, Kalisz and elsewhere in western and southern Poland in the 13th century. Another series of communities were established at Lviv, Brest-Litovsk and Grodno further east in the 14th century. King Casimir received Jewish refugees from Germany in 1349, which assisted the acceleration of a Jewish expansion in Poland that was to continue until World War II. German urban and rural settlements were another long-lasting ethnic feature.|$|E
5|$|French women's {{rights advocates}} invited {{international}} feminists {{to participate in}} a parallel conference to the Paris Conference in hopes that they could gain permission to participate in the official conference. The Inter-Allied Women's Conference asked to be allowed to submit suggestions to the peace negotiations and commissions and were granted the right to sit on commissions dealing specifically with women and children. Though they asked for enfranchisement and full legal protection under the law equal with men, those rights were ignored. Women won the right to serve in all capacities, including as staff or delegates in the League of Nations organization. They also won a declaration that member nations should prevent trafficking of women and children and should equally support humane conditions for children, women and men labourers. At the Zürich Peace Conference held between 17-19 May, 1919, the women of the WILPF condemned the terms of the Treaty of Versailles for both is punitive measures, as well as its failure to provide for condemnation of violence <b>and</b> <b>exclusion</b> of women from civil and political participation. Upon reading the Rules of Procedure for the League of Nations, Catherine Marshall, an English suffragist, discovered that the guidelines were completely undemocratic and they were modified based on her suggestion.|$|E

5|$|The {{early season}} was tumultuous, with seven {{different}} drivers winning {{the first seven}} races of the championship; a record for the series. It {{was not until the}} European Grand Prix in June that a driver, Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, won his second race of the year, and with it, emerged as a championship contender. Alonso maintained his hold on the championship lead for the next seven races, taking his third win in Germany and finishing on the podium in the United Kingdom, Italy and Singapore. However, costly first-lap retirements in Belgium and Japan allowed his rivals to catch up, and defending World Champion Sebastian Vettel – like Alonso, a two-time title winner – took the lead in the sixteenth race of the season. Vettel, too, encountered difficulties throughout the season; contact with a backmarker left him to finish outside the points in Malaysia, while alternator failures at the European and Italian Grands Prix cost him valuable points <b>and</b> <b>exclusion</b> from qualifying in Abu Dhabi led him to start from the pit lane. Vettel entered the final race of the season with a thirteen-point lead over Alonso. Alonso needed a podium finish to stand any chance of becoming World Drivers' Champion, but in a race of attrition that finished under the safety car, Vettel finished in sixth place, scoring enough points to win his third consecutive championship, becoming just the third driver in the sport's sixty-three-year history to do so. In the World Constructors' Championship, Red Bull Racing secured their third consecutive title when Sebastian Vettel finished second at the United States Grand Prix.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} some {{improvements}} {{for the basic}} algorithm for anti-unification are presented. The standard (basic) algorithm for anti-unification still may give too general answers {{with respect to the}} intended use of the result. "Too general" means obtaining an unwanted answer when instantiating some variables of the anti-unification output term. To avoid this, a term sometimes should be generalized by regarding certain (semantic) restrictions. In PAntUDE (partial anti-unification with domains <b>and</b> <b>exclusions)</b> two principal improvements of the basic algorithm were implemented and tested: it can use masks for preventing anti-unification of certain arguments (partial anti-unification); it can also use finite domains for enumerating input-term constants instead of introducing a new (universally quantified) variable, <b>and</b> finite <b>exclusions</b> for specifying forbidden constants (anti-unification with domains <b>and</b> <b>exclusions)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Languages {{based on}} logical {{variables}} can regard finite domains, finite <b>exclusions,</b> <b>and,</b> generally, types as values. Like a variable can be bound to a non-ground structure {{which can be}} later specialized through in-place assignment of some inner variables, {{it can also be}} bound to, say, a domain structure which can be specialized later through "in-place deletion" of some of its elements (e. g. by intersection with other domain structures). While finite domains prescribe the elements of a disjunctive structure, the complementary finite exclusions forbid the elements of a conjunctive structure. Domains <b>and</b> <b>exclusions</b> can be values of variables or occur inside clauses as/in terms or within an occurrence-binding construct (useful to name arbitrary terms). In a relational-functional language (e. g., RELFUN) they can also be returned as values of functions. Altogether, domains <b>and</b> <b>exclusions</b> become first-class citizens. Because they are completely handled by an extended unification routine, they do not require delay techniques needed in (more expressive) constraint systems. Still, their backtracking-superseding "closed" representation leads to smaller proof trees (efficiency), and abstracted, intensional answers (readability). Anti-unification (for generalization) exchanges the roles of domains <b>and</b> <b>exclusions.</b> The operational semantics of domains, <b>exclusions,</b> <b>and</b> occurrence bindings is specified by a RELFUN meta-unify function (and implemented in pure LISP) ...|$|R
