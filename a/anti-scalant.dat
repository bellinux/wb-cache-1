Different concentration factors and <b>anti-scalant</b> doses were studied by analyzing the water hardness and turbidity. The {{inhibitory effect}} of the investigated <b>anti-scalant</b> was efficient even at lower concentrations. The percentage inhibition decreases with increasing the temperature and increases with increasing the dose/amount of the <b>anti-scalant.</b> The carbonate scale inhibition was > 99 % and 98 – 99 % at 50 and 70 °C, respectively. The percentage inhibition of sulfate from hemihydrate was ranged from 80 % to 87 % for 2 and 8 ppm <b>anti-scalant</b> at 50 °C. The inhibition of Ca/Al hydrocalumite deposition increases from 70 % to 90 % upon increasing the dose from 3 to 5 ppm, respectively.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulation and Density Functional Theory {{were used}} to investigate the adsorption of two kinds of <b>anti-scalant,</b> ethane diphosphonic acid (EDPA) and polyether polyamino methylene phosphonate (PAPEMP), on the calcite (104) surface {{in order to increase}} the level of understanding of the anti-scaling mechanism in membrane processes for water desalination. Calculation results show that the performance of an <b>anti-scalant</b> is mainly determined by the negative electrostatic potential presented on the <b>anti-scalant</b> modified scale surface. A negative electrostatic potential on the scale surface can prevent not only the agglomeration of scale nuclei in the concentrate but also the precipitation of scale nuclei on the membrane surface. Phosphonate groups in 1, 1 -EDPA are bifunctional since they simultaneously satisfy the requirements for the electrostatic potential distribution and for the adsorption stability on the scale surface. As concerns PAPEMP, the above requirements are fulfilled respectively by different functional groups, i. e. ether groups and phosphonate groups. To simplify the role of functional groups in the anti-scaling mechanism means that the performance of an <b>anti-scalant</b> can be optimized by the combination of specific functional groups; furthermore, these functional groups can also be adjusted with respect to different scale surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Membrane scaling and {{mitigation}} techniques during air gap {{membrane distillation}} (AGMD) of seawater were investigated. The results showed {{a strong influence}} of AGMD operating temperature on not only the process water flux but also membrane scaling and subsequent cleaning efficiency. Elevating feed/coolant temperature from 35 / 25 to 60 / 50 °C increased water flux, but also exacerbated membrane scaling of the AGMD process. Membrane scaling was more severe, and occurred at a lower water recovery (68 %) when operating at 60 / 50 °C compared to 35 / 25 °C (78 %) due to increased concentration polarisation effect. Operating temperature also affected {{the efficiency of the}} subsequent membrane cleaning. Membrane scaling that occurred at low temperature (i. e. 35 / 25 °C) was more efficiently cleaned than at high temperature (i. e. 60 / 50 °C). In addition, membrane cleaning using vinegar was much more efficient than fresh water. Nevertheless, vinegar cleaning could not completely restore the membrane surface to the original condition. Traces of residual scalants on the membrane surface accelerated scaling in the next operation cycle. On the other hand, <b>anti-scalant</b> addition could effectively control scaling. Membrane scaling during AGMD of seawater at 70 % water recovery and 60 / 50 °C was effectively controlled by <b>anti-scalant</b> addition...|$|E

40|$|<b>Anti-scalants,</b> {{which are}} widely used for scale control in {{desalination}} processes, are essentially impurities capable of inhibiting scale precipitation and weakening scale adhesion on a flow surface. Many basic studies indicate that metallic ion impurities, notably Zn ions, can hinder significantly CaCO 3 precipitation from hard waters and alter crystal morphology. Recent studies demonstrate a substantial potential for suppressing CaCO 3 scale formation in hard water heating systems by trace concentrations of Zn ions. The objective of the present work was to explore the possibility of controlling CaCO 3 scale formation in RO membrane systems by a similar technique. Results obtained with a tubular RO system are most promising. A Znþþ concentration {{of the order of}} 2 PPM was able to exert a marked suppression effect on both bulk precipitation of CaCO 3 and on membrane scaling on waters of moderate hardness...|$|R
40|$|Central Arizona Project (CAP) {{water was}} treated using {{the process of}} slowsand filtration, {{chemical}} pretreatment and RO membrane. Both bench scale plate and frame reactor and pilot scale tests suggested RO membrane fouling by clay and organic matter with minor scaling by CaCO 3 and BaSO 4. Several strategies were studied to reduce RO membrane fouling and scaling. The first is choosing optimized operation conditions through bench scale tests. The second is to modify the traditional concentration polarization model for a better fouling/scaling prediction. This modified model was also used to optimize concentrate spacer design, which leads to reduced concentration polarization index. The third {{is to develop a}} method for <b>anti-scalant</b> test and comparison, which can be used for <b>anti-scalant</b> selection and dose optimization. Additional to these strategies, pre-oxidation pretreatment for RO membrane in water reuse application was investigated at bench and pilot scale. In the MBR-Ozone-RO train study, ozone showed certain impact on RO membrane fouling, but no significant difference was made on membrane cleaning frequency.

40|$|Amsterdam Water Supply {{investigated}} {{the possibilities of}} increasing {{the capacity of the}} River Dune production plant from 70 to 83 million m 3 /year. Two possibilities concern the direct treatment of pretreated Rhine River water (C/S/F) by reverse osmosis, without soil passage. In scheme 1, the RO feedwater is pretreated by ozonation, biologically activated carbon filtration and slow sand filtration. In scheme 2 only slow sand filtration is applied as pretreatment of the RO feedwater. To avoid scaling problems with BaSO 4 and CaCO 3, the RO feedwater was acidified with HCl up to a LSI in the concentrate of 0. 0 and the RO units were operated with a recovery of 85 %. The use of an <b>anti-scalant</b> (Flocon 100) in combination with H 2 SO 4 dosage (LSI in the concentrate 2. 0) and a recovery of 90 % was also successful to control scaling, but this operation mode resulted in severe biofouling as the <b>anti-scalant</b> acted as a nutrient for microbial regrowth in the membrane elements. Both pretreatment schemes resulted in an excellent RO feedwater quality with respect to MFI, DOC, AOC and BFR (biofilm formation rate) with an accompanying very stable operation of the RO units. Over a period of 11 months the MTC of the RO units only showed a decrease of 16 % and 23 % for pretreatment schemes 1 and 2, respectively, while the differential pressure remained constant. Pretreatment scheme 1 is preferred above pretreatment scheme 2 as it results in additional capacity related to disinfection and organic micropollutant removal. Also the RO concentrate is easier to be disposed of from an environmental point of view. Possibilities are mentioned to further optimize scheme 1 with respect to chemical costs and environmental impact...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} Punica granatum hull and Punica granatum leaf {{extracts}} as green inhibitors {{for the formation}} of calcium carbonate scale have been investigated using conductivity measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronoamperometry techniques in conjunction with the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy- dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) and optical microscopic examinations. Mineral scales were deposited from the brine solution by cathodic polarization of the steel surface. The results showed that the anti-scaling property of the extracts could be attributed to the presence of ellagic acid. In solution, ellagic acid retards calcium carbonate precipitation via formation of a complex with the calcium cations. Thin, smooth and non adherent film formed over the steel surface, under cathodic polarization, by the deposition of the calcium-ellagate complex. The hull extracts were found to exhibit better <b>anti-scalant</b> properties than Punica granatum leaf extract. The stability of the aqueous extracts with time was also investigated...|$|E
5000|$|Phosphonates are {{effective}} chelating agents. That is, they bind tightly to di- and trivalent metal ions, which {{is useful in}} water softening. In this way, they prevent formation of insoluble precipitates (scale). The binding of these ligands also suppresses the catalytic properties of metal ions. They are stable under harsh conditions. For these reasons, an important industrial use of phosphonates is in cooling waters, desalination systems, and in oil fields to inhibit scale formation. Phosphonates are also regularly used in reverse osmosis systems as <b>anti-scalants.</b> Phosphonates in cooling water systems also serve to control corrosion of iron and steel. In pulp and paper manufacturing and in textile industry they serve as [...] "peroxide bleach stabilizers", by chelating metals that could inactivate the peroxide. In detergents they are used as a combination of chelating agent, scale inhibitor, and bleach stabilizer. Phosphonates are also increasingly used in medicine to treat disorders associated with bone formation and calcium metabolism. Furthermore, they serve as carriers for radionuclides in bone cancer treatments (see samarium-153-ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate).|$|R
40|$|Diagnostic {{analysis}} of reverse osmosis membranes that are fed with Western Treatment Plant (WTP) recycled water was investigated by both thermodynamic calculations and laboratory experiments, {{in order to}} predict the feasibility of RO desalting for WTP. The thermodynamic calculations suggested that RO recoveries of 80 - 85 % were feasible with careful control of feed water pH {{and the use of}} chemical additives such as antiscalants and chelating agents, it also predicted the major minerals of concern to be silica, calcium fluoride, calcium carbonate, and calcium phosphate. Following the thermodynamic simulations, diagnostic laboratory experiments were undertaken. The experiments showed that the major contributor to scale formation was indeed calcium phosphate and possibly another calcium based compound, which was strongly suspected to be calcium carbonate. Based on previously published literature that indicated <b>anti-scalants</b> did not substantially decrease the scaling effect of calcium phosphate and laboratory tests that indicated controlling the pH to 6. 4 in the feed water dramatically reduced scaling formation, it was suggested that the feed water could be controlled by pH adjustments only.

40|$|The {{wastewater}} {{infrastructure in}} Singapore {{is undergoing a}} major revamp, which includes {{the construction of a}} new water reclamation plant (WRP) in Tuas. This plant aims to maximise the energy recovered from wastewater, with the ultimate aim of achieving energy self-sufficiency. The Integrated Validation Plant (IVP) is a 1000 m 3 /day pilot plant equipped with an AB configuration. The A-stage biosorption process increases the amount of COD recovered in the primary sludge to increase biogas production, whereas the B-stage membrane bioreactor (MBR) treats the wastewater using activated sludge. The effluent then undergoes reverse osmosis (RO) to produce potable water. This report investigates the biological treatment process in the IVP and aims to answer the following question: Given that most WRP in Singapore uses the Modified Ludzack-Ettinger configuration (MLE; also known as the pre-denitrification configuration) for the B-stage, will a change in configuration reduce net energy consumption while achieving good effluent quality? The research is divided into three main parts with the following objectives: 1. To create and calibrate a Biowin model to simulate the biological treatment process in the IVP 2. To optimise the MBR B-stage by finding the configuration and operating conditions that requires the least influent COD to achieve acceptable effluent quality (in terms of COD, nitrogen and phosphorus), and to determine the appropriate changes in the A-stage (if any) that is required to achieve this effluent quality 3. To explore issues facing the IVP and future developments of wastewater treatment in Singapore – effect of an unaerated deoxygenation tank, feasibility of mainstream Anammox, and modification of the treatment process to reduce chemical dosage in the downstream RO process The Biowin model for the MBR was first calibrated using jar tests and oxygen uptake tests, then validated with profile studies that are being carried out in the MBR regularly. It was found that Biowin is able to model the biological treatment process relatively well, with the major discrepancy being that Biowin is not able to model ammonia adsorption onto activated sludge in the anoxic zone. With the calibrated model, various configurations and operating conditions were simulated to optimise the MBR. It was found that the optimal configuration is the Anoxic-Oxic-Anoxic-Oxic (AOAO) configuration with a step feed of 50 % of the influent entering the first anoxic zone and 50 % entering the second anoxic zone. The return activated sludge (RAS) flow should be 73 % of the influent flow and the DO in the aerated tanks should be maintained at 1 mg/l. As the biosorption tank at the IVP is not functioning well, data was obtained from another biosorption pilot plant in Singapore to calibrate the A-stage. Using this calibrated biosorption model, the optimal MBR configuration, and the typical raw influent characteristics for the IVP, it was determined that a functioning biosorption stage will result in insufficient COD entering the MBR for sufficient phosphorus removal. To achieve the required effluent quality, the best option during steady state operations would be to reduce the sludge retention time (SRT) of the biosorption process from 0. 5 days to 0. 32 days by increasing sludge wastage as this leads to the highest overall COD recovery. On the other hand, the best method to cope with sudden increases in the nitrogen and phosphorus load in the raw influent would be to partially bypass the biosorption tank and divert some of the raw influent to the primary clarifier as this option results in the fastest response in the effluent quality. As the membrane tanks in the MBR are aerated to scour the membranes and minimise fouling, the mixed liquor in the tanks have a high concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO). A small deoxygenation tank is installed after the membrane tanks to allow DO to deplete before the mixed liquor is recycled back to the anoxic zone at the start of the MBR. However, the deoxygenation tank is not functioning well due to the presence of a cascade overflow from the membrane tanks. Simulations show that the presence of residual DO in the recycle stream leads to a large deterioration the biological phosphorus removal performance of the MBR, mainly due to reduced COD availability for the polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs). Modifications to reduce the impact of the cascade include the installation of baffle walls, slopes, or overflow pipes. One of the technologies for B-stage that can allow even higher COD recovery is mainstream Anammox for nitrogen removal, which consumes less COD than conventional nitrogen-removal processes. As it works best at temperatures of about 30 oC, it may be suitable for implementation in Singapore where the average wastewater temperature is about 31 oC. Biowin simulations revealed that mainstream Anammox can occur under the local conditions, with CANON and DEMON configurations being more suitable than the SHARON-Anammox configuration. However, a very high solids removal efficiency in the primary clarifier is required to remove sufficient COD in the A-stage for Anammox to develop in the B-stage. Further studies would be required to determine if this is achievable under local conditions. Lastly, the MBR effluent is sent to a RO process to be reclaimed as potable water. Ammonia and sodium hypochlorite is first added to produce chloramine to prevent biofouling and provide the necessary residual disinfection. it was found that the ammonia concentration in the MBR effluent can be increased sufficiently to remove the need for ammonia dosage. However, the reduced nitrification also resulted in a higher nitrite concentration in the effluent, increasing the amount of sodium hypochlorite needed to produce the required chloramine as sodium hypochlorite also oxidises nitrite into nitrate. In addition, the dosage of <b>anti-scalants</b> can be reduced with better phosphorus removal as the lower effluent phosphorus leads to less scaling potential in the RO process by calcium phosphate.

In this study, the performance of pretreatment processes (including coagulation, dual media filtration (DMF), polishing with cartridge filter (CF) coupled with <b>anti-scalant)</b> used at Perth Seawater Desalination Plant (PSDP) located in Western Australia were characterized in terms of organic and biological fouling parameters.

An inhibition system was installed in the well to prevent active deposition after a second mechanical work-over. Prior to running-in the downhole injection assembly, an obstruction was encountered at 830 meters measured depth (mMD) which limited setting depth to 815 mMD. Wellbore simulation studies indicated that if the well were operated at full-open conditions, the flash point depth (FPD) would below 940 mMD, below the calcite inhibitor injection point. With this expectation, the well’s operation was maintained at throttled conditions with a wellhead pressure greater than 12. 7 kg/cm 2 g {{in order to raise}} the FPD above 815 mMD.

Mass balance analysis and analytical measurement suggest that precipitation of calcium, magnesium and silica might have occurred. Indeed, mineral deposition on the sight glass of the MED evaporative chamber became visible after 3 days of continuous operation. However, no evidence of mineral precipitation or scaling could be observed on the evaporative tubes of the MED system.

Certain areas in developed nations also face water scarcity, such as the western states of USA, California and Arizona. In order to address the ever increasing demand for fresh water, amidst depleting reserves of fresh water, users are looking toward more saline waters, such as brackish groundwater or seawater. As seawater 2 ̆ 7 s salinity is between 33, 000 to 37, 000 mg/l and brackish water 2 ̆ 7 s salinity is between 2000 to 15, 000 mg/L, they have to be desalinated to a specific purity level before they can be used for consumption or for other purposes. For example, EPA standard for drinking water is 500 mg/L. Reverse Osmosis (RO) is the commonly preferred method for desalination. ^ Reverse Osmosis desalination of brackish waters is plagued by problems such as membrane scaling and fouling etc., which cause the RO to operate at recoveries lower than optimal. RO operation at low recovery increases the amount of brine, disposal of which adds to the product water cost. This necessitates the need for pretreatment of feed water. Detailed simulations and analysis and an extension of the Ion Exchange (IEX) pretreatment with regeneration using concentrated water from RO process (Vermeulen and Klein) were done. An IEX pretreatment helps remove the the Calcium and Magnesium ions to limit precipitation and scaling of salts on the membrane. ^ As the composition of brackish waters can have huge variations, a case study was done for two brackish waters, a Calcium rich brackish water in which the relative composition of different ion mimics a real brackish water source, and a Calcium poor brackish water in which the relative composition of different ions mimics sea water. ^ It was observed that for the Calcium rich feed considered (TDS = 12000 ppm), RO operation without IEX or <b>anti-scalant</b> pretreatment resulted in 36...|$|E
40|$|RO {{retentate}} from {{a municipal}} water recycling plant is {{considered as a}} potential feed stream for osmotic power generation in this paper. The feasibility of using RO retentate from a municipal water recycling plant was examined from two aspects: (a) the membrane fouling propensity of RO retentate, and (b) the efficacy of anti-fouling strategies. The membranes {{used in this study}} were the inner selective thin film composite polyethersulfone (TFC/PES) hollow fiber membranes, which possessed a high water permeability and good mechanical strength. Scaling by phosphate salts was found to be one possible inorganic fouling on the innermost layer of the PES membrane, whereas silica fouling was observed to be the governing fouling on the outmost surface of the PES membrane. Two anti-fouling pretreatments, i. e., pH adjustment and <b>anti-scalant</b> pre-treatment for the feed stream, were studied and found to be straightforward and effective. Using RO retentate at pH 7. 2 as the feed and 1 M NaCl as the draw solution, the average power density was 7. 3 W/m at 20 bar. The average power density increased to 12. 6 W/m by modifying RO retentate with an initial pH value of 5. 5 using HCl and to 13. 4 W/m by adding 1. 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Moreover, the flux recovery of the fouled membranes, without the indicated pretreatments, reached 84. 9 % using deionized (DI) water flushing and 95. 0 % using air bubbling under a high crossflow velocity of 23. 3 cm/s (Re = 2497) for 30 min. After pretreatment by pH adjustment, the flux recovery increased to 94. 6 % by DI water flushing and 100. 0 % by air bubbling. After pretreatment by adding 1. 1 mM EDTA into RO retentate, flux was almost fully restored by physical cleaning by DI water flushing and air bubbling. These results provide insight into developing an effective pretreatment by either pH adjustment or EDTA addition before PRO and physical cleaning methods by DI water flushing and air bubbling for membrane used in osmotic power generation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt is well {{recognized}} that calcium carbonates (CaCO 3) {{is one of}} the main components of scale that is commonly encountered in chemical and related industries. The calcium carbonate scale often grows extensively on equipment and parts, causing major operational difficulties. This paper presents experiments on calcium carbonate scale formation and control in a piping system where the scale-forming solution flowed in a laminar manner: 30, 40, and 50 mL/min, respectively. Other parameters evaluated were: solution temperature (25, 30 and 40 °C), and concentrations of malic acid (C 4 H 6 O 5) added as impurities (3. 00 and 5. 00 ppm). The scale-forming solution was made by mixing equimolar solutions of CaCl 2 and Na 2 CO 3, respectively. The scale formation process was monitored by measuring the conductivity of the solution coming out of the piping system. It was found that in all experiments, conductivity decreased abruptly after a certain induction period, during which time the conductivity remained steady. The induction period varied from 17 min to 34 min, which means that the scale starts forming 17 min to 34 min after the mixing of the solution. Higher flow rates resulted in more calcium carbonate scale mass, which indicate that the fluid flow enhances the scale formation. Similarly, increasing the temperature of the solution (25, 30, and 40 °C) resulted in the increase of the scale mass. Overall, higher malic acid concentrations resulted in longer induction time and less scale mass. Depending on the temperature and the malic acid concentration tested, the reduction in scale mass could be ≥ 200 %. This drastic reduction in scale mass suggests that malic acid could be an effective <b>anti-scalant</b> for calcium carbonate scale. SEM imaging and its associated EDS analysis confirmed that the scale formed corresponds to that of calcite (CaCO 3). The X-ray diffraction analysis of the scale showed that the scale consisted of crystalline matter which corresponds to the powder diffraction data for calcium carbonate. The addition of malic acid in trace amounts (0. 00 to 5. 00 ppm) was able to alter the morphology of the scale crystals, indicating the preference adsorption of malic acid on specific crystal surface...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} utilization of aluminum coagulation (electrocoagulation (EC) and conventional chemical coagulation) and membrane-based separation processes (microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), and reverse osmosis (RO)) for treatment of various impaired water sources. The first and major part of this research emphasizes the evaluation and optimization of aluminum (electro) coagulation combined with MF as pretreatment to NF and RO for surface water purification and water reclamation. The second part of this work focuses on mechanisms of boron removal by aluminum EC during hydraulic fracturing wastewater treatment. The overall hypothesis of the research is that aluminum EC, which generates Al(OH) 3 precipitates in situ partially removes dissolved, macromolecular, and colloidal contaminants including natural organic matter (NOM), boron, and turbidity, which can significantly improve water quality and reduce fouling in downstream membrane-based water treatment operations. In {{the first part of}} this research, coupling of electrocoagulation/electroflotation (EC/EF) with MF was shown to provide multiple barriers against contaminants such as NOM, microorganisms, and inorganics (e. g. silica) while reducing MF fouling. Furthermore, coupled EC-MF was also shown to control NF fouling during non-saline and brackish surface water treatment. This was attributed to fractional removal of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic NOM fractions along with ?nanocolloids? which consequently reduced pressure requirement for NF. Since NF fouling mechanisms depend on membrane solute rejection characteristics, this study also demonstrated the need to balance product water quality with the need to minimize NF membrane fouling through appropriate membrane selection. Potential mechanisms and effectiveness of pretreatment were evaluated by conducting forensic post-analysis of NF/RO membrane surfaces via various surface characterization techniques (e. g. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy). The effect of added chemicals (i. e. coagulant and <b>anti-scalant)</b> during operation of real-world pilot-scale RO plant for wastewater reclamation was also investigated by extensive membrane autopsy.

40|$|Treated {{municipal}} wastewater is a common, {{widely available}} alternative source of cooling water for thermoelectric power plants across the U. S. However, the biodegradable organic matter, ammonia-nitrogen, carbonate and phosphates in the treated wastewater pose challenges {{with respect to}} enhanced biofouling, corrosion, and scaling, respectively. The overall objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the benefits and life cycle costs of implementing tertiary treatment of secondary treated municipal wastewater prior to use in recirculating cooling systems. The study comprised bench- and pilot-scale experimental studies with three different tertiary treated municipal wastewaters, and life cycle costing and environmental analyses of various tertiary treatment schemes. Sustainability factors and metrics for reuse of treated wastewater in power plant cooling systems were also evaluated. The three tertiary treated wastewaters studied were: secondary treated municipal wastewater subjected to acid addition for pH control (MWW_pH); secondary treated municipal wastewater subjected to nitrification and sand filtration (MWW_NF); and secondary treated municipal wastewater subjected nitrification, sand filtration, and GAC adsorption (MWW_NFG). Tertiary treatment was determined to be essential to achieve appropriate corrosion, scaling, and biofouling control for use of secondary treated municipal wastewater in power plant cooling systems. The ability to control scaling, in particular, was found to be significantly enhanced with tertiary treated wastewater compared to secondary treated wastewater. MWW_pH treated water (adjustment to pH 7. 8) was effective in reducing scale formation, but increased corrosion and the amount of biocide required to achieve appropriate biofouling control. Corrosion could be adequately controlled with tolytriazole addition (4 - 5 ppm TTA), however, which was the case for all of the tertiary treated waters. For MWW_NF treated water, the removal of ammonia by nitrification helped to reduce the corrosivity and biocide demand. Also, the lower pH and alkalinity resulting from nitrification reduced the scaling to an acceptable level, without the addition of <b>anti-scalant</b> chemicals. Additional GAC adsorption treatment, MWW_NFG, yielded no net benefit. Removal of organic matter resulted in pitting corrosion in copper and cupronickel alloys. Negligible improvement was observed in scaling control and biofouling control. For all of the tertiary treatments, biofouling control was achievable, and most effectively with pre-formed monochloramine (2 - 3 ppm) in comparison with NaOCl and ClO 2. Life cycle cost (LCC) analyses were performed for the tertiary treatment systems studied experimentally and for several other treatment options. A public domain conceptual costing tool (LC 3 model) was developed for this purpose. MWW_SF (lime softening and sand filtration) and MWW_NF were the most cost-effective treatment options among the tertiary treatment alternatives considered because of the higher effluent quality with moderate infrastructure costs and the relatively low doses of conditioning chemicals required. Life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis along with integration of external costs of emissions with direct costs was performed to evaluate relative emissions to the environment and external costs associated with construction and operation of tertiary treatment alternatives. Integrated LCI and LCC analysis indicated that three-tiered treatment alternatives such as MWW_NSF and MWW_NFG, with regular chemical addition for treatment and conditioning and/or regeneration, tend to increase the impact costs and in turn the overall costs of tertiary treatment. River water supply and MWW_F alternatives with a single step of tertiary treatment were associated with lower impact costs, but the contribution of impact costs to overall annual costs was higher than all other treatment alternatives. MWW_NF and MWW_SF alternatives exhibited moderate external impact costs with moderate infrastructure and chemical conditioner dosing, which makes them (especially MWW_NF) better treatment alternatives from the environmental sustainability perspective since they exhibited minimal contribution to environmental damage from emissions...|$|E
40|$|Komati Power Station has {{installed}} a membrane plant consisting of ultrafiltration, double pass reverse osmosis and continuous electro-deionisation to treat cooling tower blowdowns {{in order to}} produce demineralised water and to conduct sidestream chemistry control of the cooling water circuit. This plant has replaced the existing ion-exchange plant that was used for the production of demineralised water and thus serves to reduce the loading of mobile salts in the ash dam (90 % reduction) by eliminating regeneration effluent from the ion-exchange plant. Due to oil contamination in the cooling water circuit (when oil from oil coolers leaks into the cooling water), the membrane plant was also designed to operate on raw water from either the Nooigdedacht or the Vygeboom Dam or a blend of both dams. This is considered to be an emergency intervention under abnormal conditions to prevent possible irreversible fouling of the membranes due to oil in the cooling water. The Nooigtedach Dam water contains high concentrations of organic matter and is also enriched with nutrients due to raw sewage influent into the Dam water. This poses a challenge with regard to treatment of the high fouling feed water on the membrane plant. Natural organic matter in water has the ability to foul reverse osmosis membranes. This adversely affects the operation of the reverse osmosis process. However, very little information is available regarding the fouling characteristics of natural organic material in the raw and cooling water at Komati Power Station for the reverse osmosis membranes. Therefore, a pilot study was undertaken to determine the influence of natural organic matter on membrane fouling, to optimise the process for the removal of natural organic matter and to assess the ability of two different reverse osmosis membranes to effectively treat the high fouling feed water at Komati Power Station. The ability of a polyethersulphone hollow-fibre ultrafiltration membrane system was first evaluated to remove natural organic matter in the feedwater, by conducting pilot tests, initially without coagulation of the raw water and thereafter with in-line coagulation for organics removal. Jar tests were conducted in the laboratory to determine the most suitable coagulant and dosage for turbidity and natural organic matter removal. Various coagulants were tested and, {{based on the results of}} the jar tests, a coagulant (U 3000) was identified based on optimal removal of both total organic carbon and turbidity at a dosing level of 20 mg/L. During the operation of the ultrafiltration pilot plant, permeate flow; feed pressure and feed temperature were monitored. Performance of the ultrafiltration membrane was monitored in terms of flux versus time for operation with and without a coagulation process. The results indicated that there was very little total organic carbon removal (maximum removal of 4 %) without coagulation and a slight decrease in flux. The flux declined as a result of fouling but could be recovered by performing hydraulic backwashes and CEB procedures. Permeate flux, however, could be maintained at about 90 Lmh (from 642 hours of operation). Since most of the organics passed through the ultrafiltration membrane, it was concluded that the loss in flux was due to colloidal fouling of the membrane. This was observed when the operation was carried out using raw water as feed as well as when cooling water was used. The total organic carbon removal increased to 30 % when the plant was operated with inline coagulation. The flux remained relatively stable during the first 600 hours of operation and only decreased significantly during the last 200 hours of operation as a result of fouling. The reduction in flux prior to cleaning was less than the 15 % (maximum flux decline of 9. 9 % during the test period) which is acceptable according to the industry norm of 15 %. It appeared that flux could be maintained at around 90 Lmh which was about the same as when no coagulant was applied. The 30 % total organic carbon reduction that was obtained was not sufficient to reduce the organics to the level of 6 mg/L dissolved organic carbon that was specified by the membrane manufacturer for the standard brackish water reverse osmosis membrane. Two reverse osmosis membranes – the standard brackish water reverse osmosis membrane (BW 30 - 2540) and the extra-low-fouling membrane (BW 30 XFR- 2540) – were assessed in terms of their ability to remove dissolved organic carbon, ease of cleaning of the membrane and the ability to recover flux after cleaning. This was done to establish which membrane is more suited to Komati’s high-fouling feedwater. The evaluation of the performance of the two reverse osmosis membranes was conducted using pre-treated water (filtered water after in-line coagulation, <b>anti-scalant</b> and biocide dosing) as well as using water that was not pre-treated. During operation (under both conditions), the normalised permeate flux, conductivity, dissolved organic carbon and organics absorbing at UV 254 were monitored. It was established that in terms of flux decline that the extra low-fouling membrane gave slightly superior performance to that of the standard membrane, achieving longer production runs (up to 5 days compared with 3 days achieved by the standard brackish water membrane) without requiring chemical cleaning. The low fouling membrane achieved better CWF recovery after the cleaning cycles (81. 26 % Lmh of the virgin membrane on the occasions when there was flux loss) compared to the standard membrane (restored to 77. 35 % of CWF of the virgin membrane) when using untreated feed water. This performance improved when pre-treated feed water was used and the low fouling membrane’s CWF regained after the CIP was 95. 89 % which was within the industry norm of a flux recovery of 95 %, indicating that the CIP had been effective. It was determined that the TOC rejection of the low-fouling membrane was higher (average TOC rejection of 97 %, maximum TOC rejection of 99 %) than that of the standard membrane (average TOC rejection of 95. 3 %, maximum TOC rejection of 97 %). Preliminary efforts to optimize the pre-treatment for organics removal in order to reduce organic loading for the RO membranes confirmed that the use of granular activated carbon and use of an organic scavenger resin might not be economically feasible due to the relatively quick TOC breakthrough (8910 BV, approximately 18000 BV and less than 18000 BV for the Filtrasorb 300, Filtrasorb 400 and organic scavenger resin, respectively). Although further investigations should still be conducted, the preliminary results indicate that it would be beneficial to also identify other options that can be further investigated for optimization of organics removal at Komati Power Station. Decline in the normalised flux as well as the evidence of biofouling were witnessed during the pilot operation suggesting that the membranes were fouled. Autopsies were performed on both membranes to identify foulants responsible for the decline in flux that was observed during the pilot study. The results did not indicate an organic foulant on the membrane surface. Biofouling should however, be monitored in the main plant as this was suspected to have resulted in the flux decline during the pilot study. The low fouling membrane demonstrated a better capability to treat the Komati raw and cooling water and would be expected to achieve lower operating costs for the plant (CIP costs and membrane replacement costs) while achieving better organics removal and it is therefore recommended that the low-fouling membranes be used at Komati Power Station as they are superior to the standard membrane and the cost of the low-fouling membranes is comparable to that of the standard membrane. While this would provide somewhat better performance than that obtained with the standard brackish water membranes, it is proposed that further investigation into pre-treatment optimization for organics removal as well as more efficient cleaning solutions be investigated to improve the performance and economics of the main water treatment plant at Komati power Station.
