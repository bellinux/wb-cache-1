2500|$|In 1979, Schwarz {{appealed to}} the National Party and its leader to reconsider a bill that would, in the PFP’s view, heavily {{restrict}} press freedom. He urged the Prime Minister: “I make this appeal to Mr Botha: Show this statesmanship, show {{that at this time}} you will not <b>allow</b> <b>our</b> unity of purpose to overcome the real problems to be threatened.” [...] In 1980, the National Party introduced the National Key Points Act that made those responsible for unauthorised reporting of incidents of sabotage or other attacks on declared national strategic targets a criminal. Schwarz slammed the attempts to restrict press freedoms, and stated that [...] "Society as a whole is not condemned because individuals transgress, and nor should the press as a whole be judges by the actions of individuals." [...] Stating that press restrictions marked a [...] "turning point" [...] in South African politics, he also argued that press freedom was a [...] "precious treasure" [...] and a free and courageous press was a major weapon in South Africa's defence against external threats.|$|E

Talking to 1883 Magazine, Fletcher said: [...] "After doing two massive Arena tours with McBusted, we really wanted to do something different for this tour to herald the return of McFly.

2500|$|In {{his role}} as a college {{professor}} of archaeology, Jones is scholarly and learned in a tweed suit, lecturing on ancient civilizations. At the opportunity to recover important artifacts, Dr. Jones transforms into [...] "Indiana," [...] a [...] "non-superhero superhero" [...] image he has concocted for himself. Producer Frank Marshall said, [...] "Indy [...] a fallible character. He makes mistakes and gets hurt. ... That's the other thing people like: He's a real character, not a character with superpowers." [...] Spielberg said there [...] "was the willingness to <b>allow</b> <b>our</b> leading man to get hurt and to express his pain and to get his mad out and to take pratfalls and sometimes be the butt of his own jokes. I mean, Indiana Jones is not a perfect hero, and his imperfections, I think, make the audience feel that, with a little more exercise and a little more courage, they could be just like him." [...] According to Spielberg biographer Douglas Brode, Indiana created his heroic figure so as to escape the dullness of teaching at a school. Both of Indiana's personas reject one another in philosophy, creating a duality. Harrison Ford said the fun of playing the character was because Indiana is both a romantic and a cynic, while scholars have analyzed Indiana as having traits of a lone wolf; a man on a quest; a noble treasure hunter; a hardboiled detective; a human superhero; and an American patriot.|$|E
2500|$|The Southern Christian Leadership Conference {{suspended}} King {{from the}} presidency in June 2001, concerned that he was letting the organization drift into inaction. The group's national chairman at the time, Claud Young, sent a June 25 letter to King that read, [...] "You have consistently been insubordinate and displayed inappropriate, obstinate behavior in the (negligent) carrying out of your duties as president of SCLC." [...] King was reinstated only one week later after promising {{to take a more}} active role. Young said of the suspension, [...] "I felt we had to use a two-by-four to get his attention. Well, it got his attention all right." [...] After he was reinstated, King prepared a four-year plan outlining a stronger direction for the organization, agreeing to dismiss McMorris and announcing plans to present a strong challenge to the Bush administration in an August convention in Montgomery, Alabama. In a rally on August 5, 2001, in Montgomery, SCLC leaders, including Rev. Joseph Lowery, former United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young and Rev. Jesse Jackson all pledged their support for King. [...] "I sit beside my successor, to assure him of my love and support," [...] said Rev. Lowery. King said he also planned to concentrate on racial profiling, prisoners' rights and closing the digital divide between whites and blacks.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel {{semi-automatic}} method for segmenting neural processes in large, highly anisotropic EM (electron microscopy) image stacks. Our method {{takes advantage of}} sparse scribble annota-tions provided by the user to guide a 3 D variational segmentation model, thereby <b>allowing</b> <b>our</b> method to globally optimally enforce 3 D geometric constraints on the segmentation. Moreover, we leverage a novel algorithm for propagating segmentation constraints through the image stack via optimal volumetric pathways, thereby <b>allowing</b> <b>our</b> method to compute highly accurate 3 D segmentations from very sparse user input. We evalu-ate our method by reconstructing 16 neural processes in a 1024 × 1024 × 50 nanometer-scale EM image stack of a mouse hippocampus. We demon-strate that, on average, our method is 68 % more accurate than previous state-of-the-art semi-automatic methods. ...|$|R
