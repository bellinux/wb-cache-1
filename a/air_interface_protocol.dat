Aggregation and/or traffic shaping is performed above the <b>air</b> <b>interface</b> <b>protocol</b> stacks but below the IP layer. We investigate the problem of minimizing the average packet latency (the sum of queuing delay and serving delay) under certain constraints and propose an algorithm to compute optimal packet distribution ratio across RATs to be implemented by OMMA. Moreover, we statistically characterize the reordering delay for the OMMA system and propose an algorithm to compute a modified optimal packet distribution ratio which minimizes the packet end-to-end delay, i. e., the sum of average packet latency and average packet reordering delay. Finally, some numerical results are presented to study the average packet latency, average packet reordering delay and average packet end-to-end delay for different system parameters.

40|$|Spatial {{multiplexing}} multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) {{communication systems}} have recently drawn significant attention {{as a means}} to achieve tremendous gains in wireless system capacity and link reliability. The optimal hard decision detection for MIMO wireless systems is the maximum likelihood (ML) detector. ML detection is attractive due to its superior performance (in terms of BER). However, direct implementation grows exponentially with the number of antennas and the modulation scheme, making its ASIC or FPGA implementation infeasible for all but low density modulation schemes using a small number of antennas. Sphere decoding (SD) solves the ML detection problem in a computationally efficient manner. However, even with this complexity reduction, real-time implementation on a DSP processor is generally not feasible and high-performance parallel computing platforms such as FPGAs are increasingly being employed for this class of applications. The sphere detection problem affords many opportunities for algorithm and micro-architecture optimizations and tradeoffs.

40|$|The use of {{heterogeneous}} networks {{with multiple}} radio access technologies (RATs) {{is a system}} concept that both academia and industry are studying. In such system, integrated use of available multiple RATs is essential to achieve beyond additive throughput and connectivity gains using multi-dimensional diversity. This paper considers an aggregation module called opportunistic multi-MAC aggregation (OMMA). It resides between the IP layer and the <b>air</b> <b>interface</b> <b>protocol</b> stacks, common to all RATs in the device. We present a theoretical framework for such system while considering a special case of multi-RAT systems, i. e., a multi-band wireless LAN (WLAN) system. An optimal packet distribution approach is derived which minimizes the average packet latency (the sum of queueing delay and serving delay) over multiple bands. It supports multiple user terminals with different QoS classes simultaneously. We further propose a packet scheduling algorithm, OMMA Leaky Bucket, which minimizes the packet end-to-end delay, i. e., the sum of average packet latency and average packet reordering delay. We also describe the system architecture of the proposed OMMA system, which is applicable for the general case of the multi- RAT devices. It includes functional description, discovery and association processes, and dynamic RAT update management. We finally present simulation results for a multi-band WLAN system. It shows the performance gains of the proposed OMMA Leaky Bucket scheme in comparison to other existing packet scheduling mechanisms.

40|$|Cognitive radio {{has been}} {{introduced}} by Mitola in 1999 as an extension to software radio [1] (Stevens USA). Cognitive radio extends the software radio with radio-domain model-based reasoning about etiquettes (set of RF bands, <b>air</b> <b>interfaces,</b> <b>protocols,</b> and spatial and temporal patterns that moderate {{the use of the}} radio spectrum). Cognitive radio enhances the flexibility of personal services through a Radio Knowledge Representation Language (RKRL). This language represents knowledge of radio etiquette, devices, software modules, propagation, networks, user needs, and application scenarios in a way that supports automated reasoning about the needs of the user. This empowers software radios to conduct expressive negotiations among peers about the use of radio spectrum across fluents of space, time, and user context. With RKRL, cognitive radio agents may actively manipulate the protocol stack to adapt known etiquettes to better satisfy the user’s needs. This transforms radio nodes from blind executors of predefined protocols to radio-domain-aware intelligent agents that search out ways to deliver the services the user wants even if that user doe...|$|R

In contrast to existing cellular systems, sophisticated technologies such as ultra-dense access node deployments and multi-node coordination will be supported to achieve optimum performance [43]. Frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD) systems are expected to further coexist, while TDD-only operation is expected to become more widely used in higher frequency bands. Full duplex is under investigation, but its use will probably be restricted to low-power radio nodes, e.g., for indoor and outdoor small cell applications (including in-band wireless backhaul).

The <b>interface</b> <b>protocol</b> is presented and the method is applied to two slender, blunted shapes. Both axisymmetric and three-dimensional solutions are included with surface pressure and heat transfer comparisons between the present method and previously published results. The case of Mach 25 flow over an axisymmetric six degree sphere-cone with a non-catalytic wall is considered to 100 nose radii. A stability bound on the marching step size was observed with this case and is attributed to chemistry e�ects resulting from the non-catalytic wall boundary condition. A second case with Mach 28 flow over a sphere-cone-cylinder-flare configuration is computed at both two and five degree angles of attack with a fully-catalytic wall. Surface pressures are seen to be within five percent with the present method compared to the baseline LAURA solution and heat transfers are within 10 percent. The effect of grid resolution is investigated in both the radial and streamwise directions.
