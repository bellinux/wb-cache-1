40|$|Abstract Background Autologous bone marrow-derived {{stem cells}} have been {{ascribed}} an important therapeutic role in No-Option Critical limb Ischemia (NO-CLI). One primary endpoint for evaluating NO-CLI therapy is major amputation (AMP), {{which is usually}} combined with mortality for AMP-free survival (AFS). Only a trial which is double blinded can eliminate physician and patient bias as to the timing and reason for AMP. We examined factors influencing AMP in a prospective double-blinded pilot RCT (2 : 1 therapy to control) of 48 patients treated with site of service obtained bone marrow cells (BMAC) {{as well as a}} systematic review of the literature. Methods Cells were injected intramuscularly in the CLI limbs as either BMAC or placebo (peripheral blood). Six month <b>AMP</b> <b>rates</b> were compared between the two arms. Both patient and treating team were blinded of the assignment in follow-up examinations. A search of the literature identified 9 NO-CLI trials, the control arms of which were used to determine 6 month <b>AMP</b> <b>rates</b> and the influence of tissue loss. Results Fifteen amputations occurred during the 6 month period, 86. 7 % of these during the first 4 months. One amputation occurred in a Rutherford 4 patient. The difference in amputation rate between patients with rest pain (5. 6 %) and those with tissue loss (46. 7 %), irrespective of treatment group, was significant (p = 0. 0029). In patients with tissue loss, treatment with BMAC demonstrated a lower amputation rate than placebo (39. 1 % vs. 71. 4 %, p = 0. 1337). The Kaplan-Meier time to amputation was longer in the BMAC group than in the placebo group (p = 0. 067). Projecting these results to a pivotal trial, a bootstrap simulation model showed significant difference in AFS between BMAC and placebo with a power of 95 % for a sample size of 210 patients. Meta-analysis of the literature confirmed a difference in amputation rate between patients with tissue loss and rest pain. Conclusions BMAC shows promise in improving AMP-free survival if the trends in this pilot study are validated in a larger pivotal trial. The difference in <b>amp</b> <b>rate</b> between Rutherford 4 & 5 patients suggests that these patients should be stratified in future RCTs. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Example. Two amplifiers, each rated 100 watts maximum into 4 ohms, in {{bridge mode}} they will {{appear as a}} mono <b>amp</b> <b>rated</b> 200 watts into 8 ohms.

The image shows two identical amplifiers A1 and A2 connected in bridge mode. The signals presented to each amplifier of the pair are caused to be in anti-phase. In other words, as the signal in one amplifier is swinging positively, the signal in the other is swinging negatively. If, for example the maximum output voltage swing of each amplifier is between a peak of + and - 10 volts, when the output of one amplifier is at + 10 volts the output of the other will be at -10 volts, which means that the load (a loudspeaker) now sees a 20 volt peak difference between the “hot” (normally red [...] ) output terminals. Driving the load between two signals of opposite electrical polarity makes each amplifier see only half the load's electrical impedance.|$|R

After isoprenaline, plasma cyclic AMP increased rapidly reaching a peak by 10 min and returned to basal levels within 60 min. A rapid, transient rise in heart rate occurred that was maximal by 5 min and returned to a basal level by 45 min. After fenoterol, the changes in cyclic <b>AMP</b> and heart <b>rate</b> were of much longer duration. The rise in plasma cyclic AMP was slower in onset and of greater magnitude than for isoprenaline, reaching a peak by 20 min and remaining above basal level for more than 6 h.

Fenoterol is known to have a longer duration of action as a bronchodilator in comparison with isoprenaline. The prolonged rise in plasma cyclic AMP in normal subjects given inhaled fenoterol may reflect this long duration of action.

Maximal cyclic AMP production was achieved with the same concentration of lutropin in control and lutropin-pretreated cells; however, the maximum stimulated level in pretreated cells was only 30 % of controls. The sensitivity to lutropin was decreased in lutropin-pretreated cells [ED 50 (dose that produces a response that is 50 % of the maximum response) 60 ± 5. 7 ng/ml and 8 ± 1. 8 ng/ml (mean±s. d., n= 3) for controls], as was the rate of maximal cyclic AMP production (0. 58, compared with 1. 89 pmol/ 106 cells per min for controls). However, cholera-toxin-stimulated cyclic AMP production was not decreased by lutropin pretreatment, and a potentiation was seen at all time points studied (up to 6 h). Pre-incubation with lutropin caused a decrease in specific 125 I-labelled human choriogonadotropin binding; however, this decrease was abolished if the cells were washed under acidic conditions (pH 3. 0 for 2 min at 4 °C), indicating that occupation but not loss of the lutropin receptors had taken place. The effect of pretreating the cells with lutropin on adenylate cyclase activity in purified plasma membranes was also investigated. In plasma membranes from control cells both guanosine 5 ′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate [p(NH) ppG] plus lutropin and NaF plus lutropin caused a 50 – 60 -fold linear increase in cyclic AMP production over 40 min compared with 15 -fold with p(NH) ppG and 6 -fold with lutropin alone.

A control procedure was performed to ensure any capacity loss or gain seen in tests was {{not the result of}} cell cycling. Vibration testing of the cells, on all three axes to simulate the spacecraft launch environment, showed a slight increase in capacity after vibration. Cell capacity was measured at two current rates at a variety of temperatures to obtain a family of curves to allow for a prediction of cell capacity at a given temperature. Voltage drift was explored and determined to not be a factor when matching cells for a battery. Using data from hard carbon lithium-ion cells, data for capacity loss over time, while in storage, was examined. It was determined that for an 18 -month time period, these cells lost less than 2 % of their capacity while in storage. Next, cells were cycled in simulated Low Earth Orbit power cycling to determine capacity loss while on orbit.

40|$|When perfused with {{a medium}} {{containing}} no added magnesium and 4 -aminopyridine (4 AP) (50 [*]μM) hippocampal slices generated epileptiform bursts of an interictal nature. We have {{shown in a}} previous study that adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) depressed epileptiform activity and that this effect was blocked by the adenosine A 1 receptor antagonist cyclopentyltheophylline but was not affected by adenosine deaminase. This implied that ATP might act indirectly at P 1 receptors or at a xanthine-sensitive P 2 receptor. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate further the action of ATP on epileptiform activity. ATP can be metabolized by ecto-nucleotidases to adenosine 5 ′-diphosphate (ADP), adenosine 5 ′-monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine, respectively. Each of these metabolites can activate receptors in its own right: P 2 receptors for ADP and P 1 receptors for AMP and adenosine. We now show that both AMP and ATP (50 [*]μM) significantly decrease epileptiform discharge rate in a rapid and reversible manner. 5 ′Adenylic acid deaminase (AMP deaminase, AMPase) (0. 2 [*]u[*]ml− 1), when perfused alone did not significantly alter the discharge rate over the 10 [*]min superfusion period used for drug application. When perfused concurrently with AMP (50 [*]μM), AMP deaminase prevented the depressant effect of <b>AMP</b> on discharge <b>rate.</b> <b>AMP</b> deaminase, at a concentration of 0. 2 [*]u[*]ml− 1 which annulled the effect of AMP (50 [*]μM), prevented the inhibitory activity of ATP (50 [*]μM). A higher concentration of ATP (200 [*]μM) depressed the frequency of spontaneous bursts to approximately 30 % control and this response was also prevented by AMP deaminase. Superfusion of the slices with 5 ′-nucleotidase also prevented the inhibitory activity of ATP on epileptiform discharges. The results suggest that AMP mediates the inhibitory effects of ATP on epileptiform activity, a conclusion which can explain the earlier finding that cyclopentyltheophylline but not adenosine deaminase inhibited the effect of ATP. A corollary to this is that, when examining the pharmacology of ATP, care must be taken to inactivate AMP with AMP deaminase, as well as adenosine with adenosine deaminase, before a direct action of ATP on P 1 receptors can be postulated. Failure to do so may have led to erroneous conclusions in some previous studies of nucleotide activity on nucleotside receptors...|$|R

The effect of cyclic AMP on alanine transport and Cl- distribution was mimicked by the antibiotic nigericin; the effect of nigericin was also abolished by ouabain. It is concluded that the effect of cyclic AMP on transport is mediated via membrane hyperpolarization. It is suggested that the primary action of cyclic AMP is to increase the activity of an electroneutral Na+/K+-exchange system in the liver cell plasma membrane, thus hyperpolarizing the membrane by stimulating the electrogenic Na+/K+ ATPase...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} {{effects of}} calmodulin and cyclic AMP on active Ca 2 + uptake by the islet-cell endoplasmic reticulum were investigated. Neither calmodulin nor cyclic <b>AMP</b> affected the <b>rate</b> of active Ca 2 + uptake, or the steady-state filling {{capacity of the}} endoplasmic reticulum when measured {{in the absence of}} oxalate. Consistent with these results, calmodulin did not activate the Ca 2 +-stimulated ATPase activity associated with this cell fraction. During the course of these experiments., it was unexpectedly discovered that the rate of Ca 2 + uptake, as well as the steady-state Ca 2 + filling capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum, were markedly increased by unidentified factor(s) in the cytosol. This effect could be demonstrated by reconstitution of the membranes in cytosol, or by direct addition of fresh or dialysed cytosol to the Ca 2 + uptake assays. The degree of activation by the cytosol indicates that the endoplasmic reticulum may play a prominent role in controlling beta-cell Ca 2 + concentrations and that the unidentified activator(s) present in the cytosol may be involved in regulation of this function...|$|R
5000|$|Bassists can put an {{incorrect}} (that is too low) impedance load on their amplifiers {{even if they}} connect multiple speakers {{that are at the}} correct impedance rating. For example, if a bassist has a combo amp in which the power <b>amp</b> is <b>rated</b> at 4 ohms, and she/he plugs in a second 4 ohm speaker cabinet in parallel, this will drop the impedance ("load") on the amplifier down to 2 ohms, which is too low for the amplifier. When speakers of different impedance are wired up together (e.g., an 8 ohm speaker cabinet and a 4 ohm speaker cab, the impedance is calculated differently). In most applications, when bass speakers are plugged into an amplifier, they are wired in parallel. The parallel [...] "input/output" [...] speaker jacks on the rear of most bass cabinets, when plugged into additional speakers in a [...] "daisy chain" [...] approach, will cause the speakers to be connected in parallel. More rarely, bass speaker cabs may be wired up in series, which means that the impedance is calculated differently. Series wiring is much more complicated and in cases where a bassist is using series wiring, a custom-made cabling system is typically used. Some bass manufacturers that build large speaker cabinets with multiple speakers may wire some of the speakers in series and some in parallel to achieve a certain impedance rating for the entire speaker cabinet (e.g., in 8x10" [...] speaker cabinets, the speakers inside the cabinet may be all wired up in series, but the overall cabinet's [...] "input/output" [...] jacks are in parallel). Professional bass technicians and speaker designers setting up custom-made bass speaker systems for bass players from major bands may use an electronic meter to test the impedance of the speaker cabinets they design.|$|R
