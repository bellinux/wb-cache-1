40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an <b>abrasion</b> wear <b>tester</b> to overcome some operational difficulties encountered with a linear <b>abrasion</b> wear <b>tester</b> previously developed at the University of Newcastle, Australia for bulk solids handling applications. These difficulties have been, the large quantity of wear media required, noise from the re-circulating wear media, dust generation and poor reliability. The tester developed is similar to the existing tester in that it allows samples of wall material to be abraded against real life wear media such as iron ore, bauxite, gravel, sand, etc. However, it differs in design to allow a deep bed to be applied under the test specimen so that particles up to 10 mm mean particle size can be accommodated. The machine has an annular turntable and relies on the material contained in an annular trench for bulk solids storage. To ensure random application of the wear media to the test specimen, the bulk solid is mixed continuously by a plough arrangement. The machine has been designed to allow a range of differential testing velocities from 0. 2 to 2 m/s. In-plane forces can also be measured using the test specimen holder's integral load beam. This along with the normal force applied to the test specimen may be used to determine the friction between the bulk solid and test specimen for use in estimating wear life. The machine {{has been found to be}} quiet, reliable and produces little dust. Comparison tests have been conducted on both wear machines to establish that the new tester is a suitable replacement for the existing machine...|$|R

Conventional austempering and two-step austempering processes were carried out at 280, 300, and 320 °C. Microstructures revealed that higher austemperig temperature resulted in coarser ausferrite and higher volume fractions of blocky retained austenite. The ausferrite in two-step austempered ADI was slightly coarser comparing to the coventional ADI since the temperature was raised by 30 °C during austempering. Two-body abrasion wear rates of ADIs were studied using a Suga <b>abrasion</b> wear <b>tester.</b> It was found wear rates of the two-step ADI become significantly lower than those of the conventional ADI, especially when the austempering was carried out at low temperature, i. e. 280 °C.

40|$|Currently in South Africa {{there is}} no {{acceptable}} standard method for testing coals for abrasion. Abrasion is the tendency of coals to wear away machinery. The technique referred to as YGP (Yancey, Geer and Price), proposed and accepted in 1951, is most commonly used to test for abrasion. Over the years {{there have been some}} modifications to this method by both mining houses and coal users (such as Eskom) which have resulted in inconsistent and conflicting results. To this end, this study serves {{as part of a larger}} project that will aim at devising a standard method acceptable for testing coals for abrasion in South Africa. The underlying principle behind this research was to determine the main characteristics in South African run of mine (ROM) coals that may cause abrasion. This research work specifically seeks to: (1) determine if the Abrasion Index (AI) and Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI), empirical correlations, developed by Scieszka (1985), can be verified using experimental results; (2) determine if excluded minerals and included minerals are equally abrasive; (3) establish the type of abrasive wear that occurred during coal grinding. Five ROM coals from the Witbank Coalfields were analysed. An <b>abrasion</b> index <b>tester</b> pot and Hardgrove machine were used to determine the grinding properties of the coal samples. XRD (Rietveld method), XRF, Petrography and SEM-EDS were used to characterise the coals samples in terms of their inorganic and organic components. SEM-EDS was also used for the particle morphology analysis, and blade surface topography analysis. TGA, moisture oven and sieve method were used for proximate analysis, moisture analysis, and particle size distribution analysis respectively. The results indicated that the key characteristics that influenced the AI of the coal samples were moisture, vitrinite, and minerals and mineral associations (excluded and included minerals and carbominerite) and HGI. Results indicated that coal weathering renders coals less abrasive, compared to unweathered coals. It was concluded that AI and HGI are experimentally dependent; excluded and included minerals were equally abrasive; and three-body abrasive wear was established to be the main wear during grinding in an <b>abrasion</b> index <b>tester</b> pot...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{investigation}} of the abrasion resistance of fibre reinforced concrete floors at both the macro and micro levels. A literature review of the available literature concerning subjects allied to the current project is included. This highlights themes relevant to wear mechanisms and the factors influencing it: factors that affect the abrasion resistance of concrete and several test methods for assessing it; and the historical development of fibres and the properties of different fibre types and their influence on concrete. Three accelerated <b>abrasion</b> <b>testers</b> were compared and critically discussed for their suitability for assessing the abrasion resistance of concrete floors. Based on the experimental findings one accelerated abrasion apparatus was selected as more appropriate to be used for carrying out the main investigations. The laboratory programme that followed was undertaken to investigate the influence of various material and construction factors on abrasion resistance. These included mix variations (w/c ratio), fibre reinforcement, geometry, type and volume, curing method and superplasticizing agents. The results clearly show that these factors significantly affected abrasion resistance and several mechanisms were presumed to explain and better understand these observations. To verify and understand these mechanisms that are accountable for the breakdown of concrete slabs, the same concrete specimens that were used for the macro-study, were also subjected to microstructutural investigations using techniques such as Microhardness examination, Mercury intrusion porosimetry and Petrographic examination. It has been found that the abrasion resistance of concrete is primarily dependent on the microstructure and porosity of the concrete nearest to the surface. The feasibility of predicting the abrasion resistance of fibre reinforced concrete floors by indirect and non-destructive methods was investigated using five methods that have frequently been used for assessing the quality of concrete. They included the initial surface absorption test, the impact test, ball cratering, the scratch test and the base hardness test. The impact resistance (BRE screed tester) and scratch resistance (Base hardness tester) were found to be the most sensitive to factors affecting abrasion resistance and hence are considered to be the most appropriate testing techniques.

40|$|Purpose: The wear {{resistance}} and friction reducing properties of polymer fibres {{can be improved}} with negative Poisson’s ratio behaviour. Poisson’s ratio {{is defined as the}} ratio of transverse contraction strain to longitudinal extension strain in the direction of stretching force. Large number of materials have positive Poisson’s ratio, however there are some materials which exhibit negative Poisson’s ratio, they are termed auxetic materials. Auxetic materials present unique property that they expand in all directions when they are stretched and contract when compressed. This paper has highlighted, compared and discussed the variation between the modelling, theoretical and practical differences of auxetic materials wear behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: For the purpose of this work, auxetic and conventional fibres were produced by the melt spinning mechanism using extruder. The fibres physical properties were evaluated such as Poisson’s ratio, fibre count, elongation, force and tenacity. Mono-filament fibres were used for fabrication of weft knitted fabrics; plain (1 x 1) structure was employed for knitting fabric.
