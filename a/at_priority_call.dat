40|$|Abstract- The paper proposes an {{admission}} control {{scheme based on}} adaptive bandwidth reservation to provide QOS guarantees for multimedia traffic carried in highspeed wireless cellular networks. The proposed scheme allocates bandwidth to a connection in the cell where the connection request originates and reserves bandwidth in all neighboring cells. It combines admission The proposed scheme adjusts the amount of reserved bandwidth based on the current network conditions. It distinguishes new calls and hand-off calls. It gives higher <b>priority</b> to hand-off <b>calls</b> to provide higher connectivity to users who are already accepted in the network. It reduces the bandwidth assigned to non-real time calls (i. e., low <b>priority</b> <b>calls)</b> to provide higher quality of service to real time calls (i. e., high <b>priority</b> <b>calls),</b> if necessary.

40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that quality of service {{requirements}} are not very strict for all traffic types, more <b>calls</b> of higher <b>priority</b> can be accommodated by reducing some bandwidth allocation for the bandwidth adaptive calls. The bandwidth adaptation to accept a higher <b>priority</b> <b>call</b> is more than that of a lower <b>priority</b> <b>call.</b> Therefore, the multi-level bandwidth adaptation technique improves the overall forced call termination probability as well as provides priority of the traffic classes in terms of call blocking probability without reducing the bandwidth utilization. We propose a novel bandwidth adaptation model that releases multi-level of bandwidth from the existing multimedia traffic calls. The amount of released bandwidth is decided based on the priority of the requesting traffic calls and the number of existing bandwidth adaptive calls. This prioritization of traffic classes does not reduce the bandwidth utilization. Moreover, our scheme reduces the overall forced call termination probability significantly. The proposed scheme is modeled using the Markov Chain. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme is able to provide negligible handover call dropping probability as well as significantly reduced new call blocking probability of higher <b>priority</b> <b>calls</b> without increasing the overall forced call termination probability.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general framework {{for a wide}} range of call admission control (CAC) algorithms. For several CAC schemes, which are a subset of this general framework, an analytical performance evaluation is presented for a multi-traffic mobile wireless network. These CAC algorithms consider a variety of mechanisms to prioritize traffic in an attempt to support different levels of quality of service (QoS) for different types of calls. These mechanisms include dividing the handoff traffic into more than one class and using guard channels or allowing channel splitting to admit more handoff calls. Other mechanisms aimed <b>at</b> adding <b>priority</b> for handoff <b>calls</b> consider employing queuing of handoff calls or dynamically reducing the number of lower <b>priority</b> <b>calls.</b> Furthermore, our analysis relaxes the typically used assumptions of equal channel holding time and equal resource usage for voice and data calls.

40|$|Provisioning {{of quality}} of service (QoS) is a key issue in visible light {{communication}} (VLC) system {{as well as in}} other wireless communication systems. Due to the fact that QoS requirements are not as strict for all traffic types, more <b>calls</b> of higher <b>priority</b> traffic classes can be accommodated by blocking some more <b>calls</b> of lower <b>priority</b> traffic classes. Diverse types of high data rate traffic are supported by existing wireless communication systems while the resource is limited. Hence, priority based resource allocation can ensure the service quality for the calls of important traffic class. The fixed guard channels to prioritize any class of calls always reduce the channel utilization. In this paper we propose a priority based dynamic channel reservation scheme for higher <b>priority</b> <b>calls</b> that does not reduce the channel utilization significantly. The number of reserved channels for each of the individual traffic classes is calculated using real-time observation of the call arrival rates of all the traffic classes. The features of the scheme allow reduction of the call blocking probability of higher <b>priority</b> <b>calls</b> along with the increase of the channel utilization. The proposed Markov Chain model is expected to be very much effective for the queuing analysis especially for the priority scheme of any number of traffic classes.
