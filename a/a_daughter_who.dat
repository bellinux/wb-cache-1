5|$|Duke Vincenzo was keen to {{establish}} his court as a musical centre, and sought to recruit leading musicians. When Monteverdi arrived in Mantua, the maestro di capella at the court was the Flemish musician Giaches de Wert. Other notable musicians at the court during this period included the composer and violinist Salomone Rossi, Rossi's sister the singer Madama Europa, and the tenor Francesco Rasi. Monteverdi married the court singer Claudia de Cattaneis in 1599; they were to have three children, two sons (Francesco, b. 1601 and Massimiliano, b. 1604), and <b>a</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>who</b> died soon after birth in 1603. Monteverdi's brother Giulio Cesare joined the court musicians in 1602.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda she is {{described}} as the sister of the personified moon, Máni, {{is the daughter of}} Mundilfari, is at times referred to as Álfröðull, and is foretold to be killed by a monstrous wolf during the events of Ragnarök, though beforehand she will have given birth to <b>a</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>who</b> continues her mother's course through the heavens. In the Prose Edda, she is additionally described as the wife of Glenr. As a proper noun, Sól appears throughout Old Norse literature. Scholars have produced theories about the development of the goddess from potential Nordic Bronze Age and Proto-Indo-European roots.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 1778, Dr. Lassonne, Marie Antoinette's private physician, {{confirmed}} her pregnancy. On 19 December 1778, the Queen {{gave birth}} to <b>a</b> <b>daughter,</b> <b>who</b> was named Marie-Thérèse Charlotte de France and given the honorific title Madame Royale. The birth of a girl came as a relief to the Count of Provence, who kept his position as heir to Louis XVI, since Salic Law excluded women from acceding to the throne of France. However, Louis Stanislas did not remain {{heir to the throne}} much longer. On 22 October 1781, Marie Antoinette {{gave birth to}} the Dauphin Louis Joseph. Louis Stanislas and his brother, the Count of Artois, served as godfathers by proxy for Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, the queen's brother. When Marie Antoinette gave birth to her second son, Louis Charles, in March 1785, Louis Stanislas slid further down the line of succession.|$|E

5|$|The {{lands and}} offices of Urse's brother Robert were divided between Beauchamp and Robert Marmion. Marmion and Beauchamp {{disagreed}} about {{the division of}} the lands, leading to a long dispute between the two families that was only settled in the late 12th century. Some sources state that another daughter of Urse d'Abetot married Robert Marmion, which was the reason for {{the division of the}} lands and offices between the two men. Other sources are less sure, accepting this as one possibility among several for the divided inheritance between the Marmion and Beauchamp families. Because there are no contemporary sources showing that Urse had any children besides his son and the daughter who married Beauchamp, another possibility is that Urse's brother Robert had <b>a</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>who</b> married Marmion, and that Urse managed to acquire part of her inheritance on the strength of his friendship with King William II of England.|$|E
5|$|Walter married Emma or Emmelina {{and they}} had three sons– Roger, Hugh and Walter. Roger was the heir to Weobley and Walter became Abbot of Gloucester Abbey. Occasionally the elder Walter is claimed to have married twice– once to Emma and once to an Ermeline, but this is {{probably}} a confusion of the variations of Emma's name. Walter and Emma also had <b>a</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>who</b> became a nun at St Mary's Abbey, Winchester. A niece was married to Ansfrid de Cormeilles. Considerable confusion exists about Sybil, the wife of Pain fitzJohn. C. P. Lewis names her {{as the daughter of}} Walter, but W. E. Wightman calls her the daughter of Hugh, Walter's son. Yet another pedigree has her as the daughter of Agnes, the daughter of Walter. In this rendition, favoured by Bruce Coplestone-Crow, Agnes was married to Geoffrey Talbot.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose Dudley was {{the fourth}} son of Sir John Dudley, later Viscount Lisle, Earl of Warwick and Duke of Northumberland, and his wife Jane Guildford. The Dudleys had 13 {{children}} in all and were known for their Protestant leanings {{as well as for}} their happy family life. Ambrose Dudley and his brothers were trained by, among others, the mathematician John Dee and the rhetorician Thomas Wilson. In August 1549 Dudley went to Norfolk with his father and his younger brother Robert to fight against the rebel peasant army of Robert Kett. Back in London, Dudley was knighted and married Anne Whorwood, daughter of William Whorwood, deceased Attorney-General. In 1552 they had <b>a</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>who</b> died soon. Anne also died in 1552 of the sweating sickness. Dudley soon married for the second time: Elizabeth Lady Tailboys (or Talboys, 15201563), who was a baroness in her own right with large possessions in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|Later, upon {{visiting the}} grave of Graves, Mulder and Scully learn of his suicide {{and the death of}} his {{daughter}} at a young age, <b>a</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>who</b> would be Lauren's age were she still alive. Scully suspects that Graves faked his death, but on consulting the pathologist who examined his body and testing the organs he donated to others it is proved that he indeed died. Lauren meanwhile witnesses a vision at night, including blood appearing in the bathtub, that leads her to believe that Graves was murdered. At her going-away party, Lauren is threatened by Dorlund, who believes she has knowledge of confidential information that could implicate him. Lauren calls Mulder and Scully to her home, but before the agents can get there, two assassins hired by Dorlund arrive to kill her. An invisible force kills both of them, just as Mulder and Scully arrive (with Mulder witnessing the body of one of the assassins being hanged in midair).|$|E
