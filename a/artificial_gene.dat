5|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} by some that <b>artificial</b> <b>gene</b> synthesis {{could be used}} to recreate the virus from existing digital genomes, for use in biological warfare. Insertion of the synthesized smallpox DNA into existing related pox viruses could theoretically be used to recreate the virus. The first step to mitigating this risk, it has been suggested, should be to destroy the remaining virus stocks so as to enable unequivocal criminalization of any possession of the virus.|$|E
25|$|DNA for cloning {{experiments}} {{may also}} be obtained from RNA using reverse transcriptase (complementary DNA or cDNA cloning), or {{in the form of}} synthetic DNA (<b>artificial</b> <b>gene</b> synthesis). cDNA cloning is usually used to obtain clones representative of the mRNA population of the cells of interest, while synthetic DNA is used to obtain any precise sequence defined by the designer.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{evidence}} for this hypothesis {{has not always been}} straightforward and the model proposed by Kondrashov has been criticized for assuming mutation parameters far from real world observations. In addition, in those tests which used <b>artificial</b> <b>gene</b> networks, negative epistasis is only found in more densely connected networks, whereas empirical evidence indicates that natural gene networks are sparsely connected, and theory shows that selection for robustness will favor more sparsely connected and minimally complex networks.|$|E

25|$|Man-made GFP became {{commonly}} {{used as a}} fluorescent tag to show which cells or tissues express specific genes. The genetic engineering technique fuses the gene {{of interest to the}} GFP gene. The fused DNA is then put into a cell, to generate either a cell line or (via IVF techniques) an entire animal bearing the gene. In the cell or animal, the <b>artificial</b> <b>gene</b> turns on in the same tissues and {{the same time as the}} normal gene, making GFP instead of the normal protein. Illuminating the animal or cell reveals what tissues express that protein—or at what stage of development. The fluorescence shows where the gene is expressed.|$|E
25|$|The simple {{relationship}} between {{amino acid sequence}} and DNA recognition of the TALE binding domain allows for the efficient engineering of proteins. In this case, <b>artificial</b> <b>gene</b> synthesis is problematic because of improper annealing of the repetitive sequence found in the TALE binding domain. One solution to this {{is to use a}} publicly available software program (DNAWorks) to calculate oligonucleotides suitable for assembly in a two step PCR oligonucleotide assembly followed by whole gene amplification. A number of modular assembly schemes for generating engineered TALE constructs have also been reported. Both methods offer a systematic approach to engineering DNA binding domains that is conceptually similar to the modular assembly method for generating zinc finger DNA recognition domains.|$|E

2500|$|Evans and his {{collaborators}} showed that they could introduce a new gene into cultured embryonic stem cells and then use such genetically transformed cells to make chimeric embryos. In some chimeric embryos, the genetically altered stem cells produced gametes, thus allowing transmission of the artificially induced mutation into future generations of mice. In this way, transgenic mice with induced mutations in the enzyme Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) were created. The HPRT mutations were produced by retroviral insertion; it was proposed that {{by taking advantage of}} genetic recombination between the normal HPRT gene and an <b>artificial</b> <b>gene</b> sequenced added to the cultured embryonic stem cells, [...] "it may also eventually be possible to produce specific alterations in endogenous genes through homologous recombination with cloned copies modified in vitro". The production of transgenic mice using this proposed approach was accomplished in the laboratories of Oliver Smithies, and of Mario Capecchi.|$|E

[...] Prior to the development of this technique, insulin was extracted from the pancreas glands of cattle, pigs, and other farm animals. [...] While generally efficacious in the treatment of diabetes, animal-derived insulin is not indistinguishable from human insulin, and may therefore produce allergic reactions. Genentech researchers produced <b>artificial</b> <b>genes</b> for each of the two protein chains that comprise the insulin molecule. [...] The <b>artificial</b> <b>genes</b> were [...] "then inserted... into plasmids... among a group of genes that" [...] are activated by lactose. [...] Thus, the insulin-producing genes were also activated by lactose.

40|$|To {{monitor in}} vivo {{transcription}} and chromatin structure of yeast tRNA genes, we constructed a synthetic tRNA gene {{that can be}} used as a reporter. Constructs in which this synthetic tRNA gene is combined with different flanking regions can be integrated into the genome as single copies. The <b>artificial</b> tRNA <b>gene</b> is tagged by the insertion of an intron-like sequence that cannot be spliced out from the precursor and transcripts can thus be identified and quantitated. By several criteria, the <b>artificial</b> tRNA <b>gene</b> behaves like a resident tRNA gene. By measuring the accessibility towards DNaseI in chromatin, we found that the <b>artificial</b> tRNA <b>gene</b> exhibits the same characteristic pattern as resident tRNA genes. Three DNaseI-sensitive sites across the transcribed part of the gene and the immediate flanking regions reflect the formation of the stable transcription complex; positioned nucleosomes are observed in the upstream flanking region.
