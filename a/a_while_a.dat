25|$|Water in {{a closed}} jar with an air space over it forms a two phase system. Most of the water is in the liquid phase, where it is held by the mutual {{attraction}} of water molecules. Even at equilibrium molecules are constantly in motion and, once in <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>a</b> molecule in the liquid phase gains enough kinetic energy {{to break away from}} the liquid phase and enter the gas phase. Likewise, every once in <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>a</b> vapor molecule collides with the liquid surface and condenses into the liquid. At equilibrium, evaporation and condensation processes exactly balance and there is no net change in the volume of either phase.|$|E

Two years later Railway Director Carl Abraham Pihl led a survey group. Their work concluded in 1875, ending in a recommendation to build the line. Two route proposals were made, one across Gjelsåsen and one following Glomma. Parliament dismissed approving the line in 1877. By then the country had fallen into an economic decline and Parliament did not want to issue further funding to railways not already under construction.|$|E

25|$|Originally, {{the fort}} was {{built as a}} base for the Qatari {{military}} and police to protect Qatar’s north-west coast as part of a series of forts along Qatar’s coastline. It was restored in 1987 with the removal of a number of much later auxiliary buildings erected to house the Qatari forces. After opening, the fort quickly became a major heritage attraction and, for <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>a</b> local museum. Due to the unsuitable conditions in the fort for displaying and storing finds, the objects were relocated to Doha in 2010. Starting in 2011, the Qatar Museums Authority conducted a project of monitoring and restoration to ensure the upkeep of the fort. Between 2010 and 2013, parts of the fort were inaccessible to visitors.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of his growing {{reputation}} Lanfranc was invited to defend the doctrine of transubstantiation against the attacks of Berengar of Tours. He took up the task with the greatest zeal, although Berengar had been his personal friend; he was the protagonist of orthodoxy at the Church Councils of Vercelli (1050), Tours (1054) and Rome (1059). To Lanfranc's influence is attributed the desertion of Berengar's cause by Hildebrand and the more broad-minded of the cardinals. Our knowledge of Lanfranc's polemics is chiefly derived from the tract De corpore et sanguine Domini, probably written c. 1060-63. Though betraying no signs of metaphysical ability, his work was regarded as conclusive and became for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>a</b> text-book in the schools. It is often said to be the place where the Aristotelian distinction between substance and accident was first applied to explain Eucharistic change. It is the most important of the surviving works attributed to Lanfranc.|$|E
25|$|Although toy trains were {{historically}} produced to this scale, O gauge's popularity {{across the}} whole of Europe reduced after World War II, and the standard is rarer than in the United States. Modelling in O gauge in fact almost died out in Britain but enjoyed a resurgence in the 1990s as modellers developed a new appreciation for the level of accurate detailing possible in this scale. Some ready to run models are produced in this scale but most are available only as kits for assembly by the modeller or a professional model-builder. O gauge is considered an expensive scale to model in although the necessarily smaller scope of a larger-scaled layout mitigates this to some extent. The two dominant British manufacturers, Bassett-Lowke and Hornby, ceased production of O gauge trains in 1965 and 1969, respectively. However, ACE Trains and for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>a</b> revived Bassett-Lowke are once again producing tinplate O gauge sets, many of them reproductions of classic Hornby and Bassett-Lowke designs, and Heljan also recently joined the market producing O gauge Diesel locomotives.|$|E

The Greater Jamaica Development Corporation (GJDC), the local business improvement district, acquired valuable real estate for sale to national chains in order to expand neighborhood commerce. As well they have completed underway proposals by allocating funds and providing loans to potential investors who have already established something in the area. One Jamaica Center is a mixed-use commercial complex that was built in 2002 by The Mattone Group housing Old Navy, Bally Total Fitness, Walgreens, Subway, Dunkin' Donuts, a 15-screen multiplex theater and for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>a</b> Gap. Banking has also made a strong revival as Bank of America, Sterling National Bank, Chase Bank, and Carver Federal Savings Bank have each created at least one branch along various major streets: Jamaica Avenue, Parsons Boulevard, Merrick Boulevard, and Sutphin Boulevard. A $75 million deal between the developers, the Mattone Group and Ceruzzi Enterprises, and Home Depot cleared the way for a new location at 168th St. and Archer Ave. All approvals were obtained within three months of the application dates.|$|E

25|$|Aaron Kosminski {{was born}} in Kłodawa in Congress Poland, then part of the Russian Empire. His parents were Abram Józef Kozmiński, a tailor, and his wife Golda née Lubnowska. He may have been {{employed}} in a hospital as a hairdresser or orderly for a time. Aaron emigrated from Poland in 1880 or 1881, likely with his sisters' families. The family initially lived in Germany for <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>A</b> nephew of Aaron's was born there in 1880 and a niece in 1881. It is not known precisely when Aaron left Poland to join his sisters or whether he lived in Germany {{for any length of}} time, although he may have left Poland {{as a result of the}} March 1881 pogroms following the assassination of Tzar Alexander II, the impetus for many other Jews to emigrate. The family moved to Britain and settled in London sometime in 1881 or 1882. His mother, who was listed as a widow, apparently did not emigrate with the family immediately, but had joined them by 1894. It is unknown whether his father died or abandoned the family, but he did not emigrate to Britain with the rest of them. It is known that he had likely died before 1901, and an 1887 death certificate indicates that an Abram Kosminski had died in the Polish town of Koło, only five miles from Grzegorzew, the hometown of Kosminski's father.|$|E

500|$|During {{the late}} 1970s there arose {{plans to build}} a branch line from the Drammen Line to Oslo Airport, Fornebu.

Later the plans were reformulated and for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>a</b> people mover was a preferred mode. By 2007 Ruter had changed their opinion in the matter and instead wanted to operate a light rail to Fornebu. The Rail Administration therefore decided to remove the station hall for a people mover from the Lysaker Station plans. Because the people mover was canceled after construction of the station had started, the National Rail Administration has claimed the county for NOK 31million to cover losses incurred.|$|E

Initial production occurred in September, with Gaiman visiting the set during the production period and filming for the associated Confidential. Additional filming took place in October 2010, with guest star Suranne Jones having been filmed for green screen special effects. The scenes where Amy and Rory are on the run allowed the audience to explore the TARDIS outside the control room, something the producers had wanted to do for <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>A</b> series of corridors was constructed and retained for future use.

The set was retained after filming for [...] "The Eleventh Hour", but has since been removed {{to become part of the}} Doctor Who Experience exhibit. Arthur Darvill noted the floor of the older set had a cheese grater-like quality to it, so when the scene called for the cast to fall on it, they found it uncomfortable to stay down for a long period of time.|$|E
