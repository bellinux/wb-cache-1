2500|$|In September 1994, Nunn, former President Jimmy Carter {{and former}} Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell were asked by President Bill Clinton {{to go to}} Haiti in order to force the {{departure}} of the military dictator Lieutenant General Raoul Cédras. In 1994 Clinton publicly demanded that the Haitian government step aside and restore democratic rule. Clinton deployed a large military force to surround the country in September 1994. Just before the troops reached Haiti, Clinton sent a delegation led by Carter, Nunn and Powell to urge Cédras to step down and leave the country. Cédras agreed and surrendered the government, and he and his top lieutenants left the country in October. Just days later, American forces escorted the country’s elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, into the capital. Afterwards, Clinton lavished praise on Nunn's delegation for averting a military strike on the nation. [...] "As all of you know, at my request, President Carter, Gen. Colin Powell, and Sen. Sam Nunn went to Haiti to facilitate the dictators' departure. I have been in constant contact with them for the last two days. They have worked tirelessly, almost around the clock, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> them for undertaking this crucial mission on behalf of all Americans", Clinton said.|$|E
