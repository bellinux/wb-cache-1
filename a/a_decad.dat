In spite of a wealth of animal investigations and a number of human studies, however, available information concerning the human "enteric nervous system" is comparatively sparse. In the opinion that such lack of information was largely due to unavailability of appropriate techniques, we have initiated and developed a new comprehensive methodology.

5000|$|Like Gnosis at large, the Ophites {{teach the}} {{existence}} of a Supreme Being, standing infinitely high above the visible world; qualified as purely spiritual, the primal basis of all things, the starting-point of the cosmic process. His names are, Father of the Universe, First Man, the [...] "Uncreated," [...] the [...] "Unspeakable," [...] the [...] "Unapproachable God." [...] He is self-evolving, and thus becomes the source of all being. The first products of this spontaneous evolution still belong to the purely spiritual spheres. The Ophitic theology tends to separate this supreme God into an ever-increasing number of separate entities. In the aforesaid Hymn, only the Son is mentioned beside the Father; but a tetrad occurs among the Ophites of Irenaeus and the Naassenes; <b>an</b> entire <b>decad</b> among the Gnostici Barbelo; while the Nag Hammadi writings disclose a countless host of higher beings. The Supreme Being's mode of evolution is set forth, now as a generative, again as a psychologic process; and frequently the two ideas are combined. Some pagan mythology lies obviously {{at the root of the}} matter; which accounts also for their syzygial views; for, in part at least, the Ophites aimed to interpret the ancient myths as psychologic processes. Over against the Supreme Being stands chaos, the material principle. Yet there is not here a sharp dualism. In the Hymn, the phrase [...] "the firstborn's emitted chaos" [...] implies that it is derived from a higher being. In only very few instances is chaos an evil power, an active principle. It is not {{the existence of}} chaos which contradicts perfection; but rather the mixture of luminous parts with material elements. This mixture, in a word, is the great calamity, the loss that must be retrieved through redemption. How did this mixture come to pass? The Hymn designates the soul, the principle of this compound, as the common product of mind and chaos. Such is also the theory of the Perates and Sethians, mentioned by Hippolytus. These sects most nearly approach the dualistic scheme, yet the latter is not distinctly defined. In Justin, also, dualism is diminished.|$|R

A third source (U) exists which is slightly adapted from (P) and (L).

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the statutes of a dozen of devout women's congregations originating in the early decads (1380 - 1400) of the Devotio Moderna in the western and eastern parts of the present-day Netherlands. Each of these congregations or sisterhouses, except one, survived into the fifteenth century and beyond, evolving either into a house of sisters of the common life or into a tertiaries' convent or a monastery of regular canonesses. The early statutes of these sisterhouses are read {{with an eye to}} the question what information on the religious values cherished by the women accommodated in the houses and on the way these values were articulated, can be gleaned from them. The practical aspects of the organisation of these communities are analysed as well: they appear to offer considerable pluriformity, {{due to the fact that}} the participants had to improvise and were obliged to borrow from a variety of existing institutions. The common life as it was practiced later on in the sisterhouses of the Devotio Moderna, had been introduced in some of them, mainly in the west, but was not the standard as yet. The members of the devout congregations had opted for a life of withdrawal from the world and of mortification, revealing itself in reluctance to converse with men, austerity in food and clothing, and suppression of the wish to go into the streets and to intermingle with non-converted people. By a cooperative attitude the sisters contributed to the inner peace of the households, which was highly valued because it was considered to be indispensable for the virtuous life. They were expected to pray for their benefactors. Much stress was laid on the fact that they had been provided with lodging in the sisterhouses 'purely for God's sake'. This had been done as a response to their clearly expressed wish to lead a pure christian life, in which the virtue of 'religion' would take the lead. Their decision to enter the devout life had to be rewarded without the mistake of falling into simony. In their 'shelters', the women considered themselves to be 'poor women' (in a near-contemporary testament: pauperes puellae), meaning the destitute who had become God's chosen ones and who responded to their election by putting their lives in the service of God. Their way of life was not articulated as yet as the 'common life' of the primitive Church of Acts 4. In the beginning, the New Devout reserved this 'ideology' for the monastic branch of their movement; it came to be applied to the sisterhouses only after <b>a</b> few <b>decads.</b> Instead, these accentuated their poverty as well as their 'sisterly love' and the reciprocal edification in virtues as the essence of their congregations. © Ons Geestelijk Erf.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{the topic}} of textual {{variation}} in Sumerian literary compositions was examined. Many of the literary works that were composed in Sumerian are known primarily from copies that were produced during the Old Babylonian Period (ca. 1900 [...] 1700 B. C. E.). The copies of these compositions, which, with few exceptions, have typically survived in an average of ten to fifty, but in some instances, as many as 200 duplicates, rarely, if ever, contain completely identical {{versions of the same}} text. Since, in the absence of single, definitive 2 ̆ 2 master copies 2 ̆ 2 of these texts, it is necessary to reconstruct their content {{solely on the basis of}} these divergent exemplars, and being able to distinguish correct from incorrect differences in these duplicates is critical for establishing reliable and accurate editions of these compositions, the primary goal of this dissertation was to develop a method for critically assessing and interpreting the variants that occur among the copies of these texts. ^ Focusing on a small, but representative group of ten compositions known as the <b>Decad,</b> <b>a</b> methodology for analyzing textual variation was proposed and applied to the texts in this corpus. Since it can be shown that most, if not all of the copies of these compositions were written as exercises by scribes being trained to learn to write Sumerian, and that these exercises frequently involved copying from memory, the implications of this were considered as a means of identifying specific types of variants as errors that resulted from this process. In addition, complete catalogues of all the variants that occur both across this corpus as a whole and within each of the individual sources for these texts were compiled both to illustrate the use of this method, as well as to serve as a reference to facilitate the assessment of variants in the duplicates of these and the extensive body of related compositions, that would also provide a basis for future studies of this subject. ...|$|R
40|$|This report investigates future {{trends in}} {{marriage}} and the family. The project was started because of the revolutionary changes in marriage and family life in the Netherlands since about 1965 (Chapter 1). A brief review {{of the history of}} {{marriage and the}} family shows that the characteristics and functions of this institution have changed considerably with time. A search of the scientific literature on the future of marriage and the family shows a need for well founded research on future trends in marriage and the family as a whole (Chapter 2). Experts were consulted to study the future of marriage and the family, and results were processed by the Delphi method, developed in research on the future. Chapter 4 discusses the merits and shortcomings of research on the future in general, specially by the Delphi method. Research was concentrated on the following questions: (Chapter 3) 1. What changes did the selected experts expect in marriage and the family in the next fifteen years? (to about 1990) 2. What factors influenced to the experts' opinion the changes in marriage and the family? 3. What changes did the experts want in marriage and the family in the next fifteen years? 4. To what extent did the experts' field of expertise and personal values in fluence their expectations and desires for changes?The concept of expert was defined widely in this research, namely persons who are professionally strongly involved in marriage and the family in view of their publications, their field of activity or other things. The experts were consulted in two rounds, each time by a mailed questionnaire. The purpose of the second round was to clarify and deepen the results from the first round. Respondents in the first round were 155 and in the second 126 persons from four sectors of society and from eleven scientific disciplines. Respondents from the four sectors of society were scientists, field workers, policy makers and opinion formers. The data were collected in the period from the end of 1975 to the beginning of 1977 (Chapter 5). In the first round, we asked respondents about changes in 69 aspects of marriage and the family. There was little consensus on expectations for most aspects. For desirable developments, there was even less consensus (Chapter 6). Results from the first round were ordered by a factor analysis. Expectations could be reduced to the following seven factors: 1. Non-marital cohabitation, that does not threaten marriage and the family (ASL). 2. The romantic image of marriage (RHB). 3. Exclusivity of the man-woman relation (E). 4. Role and task division between husband and wife and between family and society (RMGS). 5. Family size (GG). 6. Domestic care (DV). 7. Leisure (VT). These factors are considered as attributes of family types. The expected developments in marriage and the family may be reproduced by a number of family types, constructed from the seven attributes. Family types are in this study combinations of developments in the intimate sphere in the period 1976 to about 1990. Family types, constructed on the basis of results from the first round, were submitted for a judgment in the second round. For desirable developments, family types were constructed in the same way but from five attributes: 1. Non-marital cohabitation, that does not threaten marriage and the family (ASL). 2. Exclusivity of the man-woman relation (E). 3. Role and task division between husband and wife and between family and society (RMVGS). 4. Family size (GG). 5. Leisure (VT). The second round showed that most of the respondents (66 %) expected three family types (Chapter 7). The remaining part of the respondents expected fifteen family types. Type b was mentioned by half the respondents and Types a and f were expected by 6 % and 10 % of the respondents, respectively. These three most expected family types differ in the expected changes in romantic image of marriage and domestic care. For these attributes, expectations were most divergent. Nearly all respondents (more than 98 %) agreed that non-marital cohabitation would occur more frequently and that the role and task division between husband and wife and between family and society would become more interchangeable. Most respondents (more than 88 %) expected leisure to increase, family size to diminish and exclusivity of the man-woman relation to decrease. The consensus on this last attribute was conspicious, because the respondents opinion differed plainly on this matter after the first round of questions. Perhaps this shift in results was caused also by different formulation of questions in the two rounds (Appendix 1 and 2). Expectations about society had little influence on expectations for family types. Changes mentioned were: becoming abstracted from society; economic growth; economic order; position of labour in society; and the influence of church and religion in society. Education, experience, age and sex of the respondents did not influence the family types they expected either. The respondents' personal values hardly influenced their expected combinations of developments to marriage and the family. More information about the background of the expected family types a, b and f was obtained from the answers of the respondents themselves in the first round. The three most common combinations of expectations in marriage and the family were marginally related to expectations about society. The desired types of marriage and family are discussed in Chapter 8. Desired family types, contrary to expected types, hardly had any general significance for society. The vast majority of respondents (nearly 80 %) desired three combinations of developments to marriage and the family. Two of these three family types were each desired by about equal numbers of respondents (Type p by 33 % and Type s by 38 %), while Type t was named by about 8 %. The remaining respondents desired ten other family types. The most commonly desired family types p, s and t differed in exclusivity of m-w relation and in family size. Nearly all respondents (more than 93 %) agreed that non-marital cohabitation should increase, that the role and task division should be more interchangeable and that leisure activities should increase. Compared to the first round, in the second round the consensus for changes in role and task division was conspicious, whereas opinions were divided about exclusivity of the man-woman relation. Again the difference in formulation of questions between the two rounds may have influenced this shift in results (Appendix 1 and 2). The most desired family types were not isolated from desires about society. One of the most distinct factors was desires about influence of church and religion in society. More influence of church and religion was correlated with more preference for Types p and t, while less influence was correlated with a preference for Type s. The influence of church and religion in society may strengthen the value of an exclusive relation between man and woman and counteract factors that reduce the number of children. Less significant factors in the preference for one of the Types p, s or t were desires about the position of labour in society, desires about the economic order and about abstraction from society. Besides desires about society, the characteristics of the respondents influenced the types they desired: the sort of expertise, age and whether married, single or divorced. Of personal values, religious values were especially relevant. Religiousness may induce a preference for strengthening of the exclusivity of the man-woman relation and for an increase in family size. A distinction was necessary in religiousness between traditional and modern attitudes. A comparison of the expected and desired types had only a limited significance, but helped to clarify results. There was more consensus among the respondents about expectations than about desires. Half the respondents expected Type b,whereas preference was equally divided between Types p and s. The second round sharpened differences between expectation and desire about exclusivity and family size. If the expressed desires be accepted as generally desirable, there will in the near future be conflicts about exclusivity and family size, but are less likely for non-marital cohabitation, role and task division, and leisure. The distinction made between expectation and desire was based on theory, but can also be empirically based. The types the respondents desired proved more subjective than those they expected. In Chapter 9, the value of this investigation is discussed. Attention is paid to the significance for methodology and the significance of the results.

This article examines the medical home through the lens of philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre and offers a perspective, informed by Hubert Dreyfus and Peter Senge, about medi-cal homes as practical sites of formation for family physicians. The intellectual past of family medicine points to contextually sensitive patient care as a practice that is particular to the discipline, with the virtue of “placing patients within contexts over time ” as a commonly held virtue. Dreyfus provides a model of knowledge and skill acquisition that is relevant to the training of family physicians in practical wisdom. In this model, there is a continuum from novice to more advanced stages of professional for-mation that is aided by rules that not only must be learned, but must be applied in greater contextually informed situations. Senge’s emphasis on learning organizations—organizations where people are continually learning how to learn together—presents a framework for evaluating the extent to which future medical homes facilitate or retard the formation of family physicians.

40|$|The {{attempts}} {{to find the right}} (underlying) theory for the nuclear force have a long and stimulating history. Already in 1953, Hans Bethe stated that ”more man-hours have been given to this problem than to any other scientific question in the history of mankind”. In search for the nature of the nuclear force, the idea of sub-nuclear particles was created which, eventually, generated the field of particle physics. I will review this productive history of hope, error, and desperation. Finally, I will discuss recent ideas which apply the concept of an effective field theory to low-energy QCD. There are indications that this concept may provide the right framework to properly understand nuclear forces. 1 Historical perspective The theory of nuclear forces has a long history (cf. Table 1). Based upon the seminal idea by Yukawa [1], first field-theoretic {{attempts to}} derive the nucleonnucleon (NN) interaction focused on pion-exchange. While the one-pion exchange turned out to be very useful in explaining NN scattering data and the properties of the deuteron [2], multi-pion exchange was beset with serious ambiguities [3, 4]. Thus, the “pion theories ” of the 1950 s are generally judged as failures—for reasons we understand today: pion dynamics is constrained by chiral symmetry, a crucial point that was unknown in the 1950 s. Historically, the experimental discovery of heavy mesons [5] in the early 1960 s saved the situation. The one-boson-exchange(OBE) model [6, 7] emerged which is still the most economical and quantitative phenomenology for describing the nuclear force [8, 9]. The weak point of this model, however, is the scalarisoscalar “sigma ” or “epsilon ” boson, for which the empirical evidence remains controversial. Since this boson is associated with the correlated (or resonant) exchange of two pions, a vast theoretical effort that occupied more than <b>a</b> <b>decad...</b>|$|E
