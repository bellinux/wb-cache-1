5|$|Flight Unlimited is a 1995 <b>aerobatic</b> flight {{simulator}} video game developed {{and published by}} Looking Glass Technologies. It allows players to pilot reproductions of real-world aircraft and to perform <b>aerobatic</b> maneuvers. They may fly freely, race through floating rings against a timer or take lessons from a virtual flight instructor. The instructor teaches basic and advanced techniques, ranging from rudder turns to maneuvers such as the tailslide, Lomcevak and Immelmann turn.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aerobatic</b> {{competitions}} {{take place}} for both powered aircraft and gliders, {{with up to}} 30 events {{each year in the}} UK and Ireland. Starting at the Beginner level, pilots can move up to Standard (powered aircraft) or Sports (glider) levels, and then on to Intermediate, Advanced, and finally Unlimited classes. Each step up requires a wider repertoire of <b>aerobatic</b> figures and progressively more performance from the aircraft. National championships are awarded annually at Standard/Sports, Intermediate, Advanced (powered aircraft only), and Unlimited levels, and pilots who have reached Advanced and Unlimited levels are eligible for selection to represent the UK in international competition.|$|E
5|$|Play {{behaviour}} {{has been}} observed with birds dropping a leaf {{in the air and}} catching it in mid-air and these may possibly help young birds acquire <b>aerobatic</b> skills.|$|E
5|$|Allingham {{celebrated his}} 112th {{birthday}} {{with members of}} his family at RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire as the guest of honour at a luncheon at the college. During the day the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight performed a flypast which was followed by an <b>aerobatic</b> display from two Tutor aircraft. In June 2008, at his personal request, Allingham was taken on a guided tour of the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft at BAE Systems in Warton, Lancashire, as part of the National Veterans' Day celebrations.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, a state ensign {{was created}} {{specifically}} for non-military vessels engaged in non-commercial government service; this defaces the Italian tricolour {{with the national}} coat of arms. Since 1914, the Italian Air Force have also used a roundel of concentric rings in the colours of the tricolor as aircraft marking; substituted, from 1923 to 1943, by encircled fasces. The Frecce Tricolori, officially known as the 313º Gruppo Addestramento Acrobatico, is its <b>aerobatic</b> demonstration team.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the Singaporean Hunter fleet was {{upgraded}} and modified by Lockheed Aircraft Services Singapore (LASS) {{with an additional}} hardpoint under the forward fuselage and another two inboard pylons (wired only for AIM-9 Sidewinders) before the main gears, bringing {{to a total of}} seven hardpoints for external stores and weapons delivery. As a result of these upgrades, they were redesignated as FGA.74S, FR.74S and T.75S. The RSAF Black Knights, Singapore Air Force's <b>aerobatic</b> team, flew Hunters from 1973 until 1989.|$|E
5|$|On 10 October 1984, GG1001 {{crashed in}} South Korea on a {{demonstration}} flight, killing Northrop pilot Darrell Cornell. An investigation cleared the F-20 of mechanical or design faults; it concluded Cornell had blacked out due to excessive g-forces. GI1001 crashed in May 1985 at Goose Bay, Labrador, killing Northrop pilot Dave Barnes. Again the crash was blamed on G-LOC; Barnes had been practicing his <b>aerobatic</b> routine for the Paris Air Show.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} recognition {{of the extent to}} which birds engage in play. Juvenile common ravens are among the most playful of bird species. They have been observed to slide down snowbanks, apparently purely for fun. They even engage in games with other species, such as playing catch-me-if-you-can with wolves, otters and dogs. Common ravens are known for spectacular <b>aerobatic</b> displays, such as flying in loops or interlocking talons with each other in flight.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the former}} A-4Gs were also lost during their service with the RNZAF. On 16 February 2001, NZ6211 (882 in Australian service) crashed near Nowra while practising an <b>aerobatic</b> {{manoeuvre}} with another Skyhawk; its pilot, who was also the commanding officer of No. 2 Squadron, was killed instantly. The last former A-4G to be lost was TA-4K NZ6256 (the former 881), which crashed into the Indian Ocean off Perth, Western Australia, on 20 March 2001. Its pilot ejected and survived.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited was {{the first}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. It was intended to establish the company as a video game publisher and to compete with flight simulator franchises such as Microsoft Flight Simulator. Project leader Seamus Blackley, a particle physicist and amateur pilot, conceived the game in 1992. He felt that other flight simulators failed to convey the experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding a simulated atmosphere for Flight Unlimited based on real-time computational fluid dynamics. <b>Aerobatic</b> pilot Michael Goulian endorsed the game and assisted the team in making it more true to life.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Davis {{served in}} a number of {{administrative}} positions in the United States. On August 10, 1945, he was assigned to the 556th Air Base Unit at Long Beach, California. On August 24, 1946, he was offered a commission as a first lieutenant in the active duty Army Air Corps, demoting him from his temporary rank but effectively allowing him to stay in the military in spite of the demobilization and downsizing of the US military. Several weeks later on September 7, Davis was ordered to the 554th Air Base Unit in Memphis, Tennessee, where he served on one of the Army Air Corps <b>aerobatic</b> demonstration teams, the predecessors to the United States Air Force Thunderbirds.|$|E
5|$|Air Vice Marshal Allan Leslie Walters, CB, CBE, AFC (2November 1905– 19October 1968) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Born in Victoria and raised in Western Australia, {{he graduated from the}} Royal Military College, Duntroon, before transferring to the RAAF in 1928. He was considered one of the service's leading flying instructors and <b>aerobatic</b> pilots between the wars, and was appointed to his first squadron command in 1937. Over the course of World WarII, Walters led No.1 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron in Singapore, No.1 (Fighter) Wing in Darwin, Northern Territory, No.72 Wing in Dutch New Guinea, and Northern Command in Papua New Guinea. He was decorated with the Air Force Cross in 1941 for his work with No.1 Squadron, and mentioned in despatches in 1944 for his service with No.72 Wing.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{departure}} of No.1 FTS in 1947, no flying was conducted at Uranquinty until 1951, when the newly formed No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS) inherited the base facilities. No.1 BFTS transferred to Point Cook in 1958, at which point Uranquinty was closed. The RAAF units that operated at the base formed a close connection with the local community. In 1999, a memorial to No.5 SFTS was erected at Wirraway Park, Uranquinty. An additional panel to the memorial was unveiled in September 2002 by the Governor-General of Australia, Peter Hollingworth; the proceedings included an aerial display by a Pilatus PC-9 of the Roulettes <b>aerobatic</b> team, {{and the arrival of}} a Wirraway from Temora Aviation Museum, the first time in 45 years that one of these trainers had landed at Uranquinty.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the Swedish Air Force saw {{the need for}} an {{interceptor}} that could reach enemy bombers at a higher altitude than the J 29 Tunnan that formed the backbone of the fighter force. A contract for 120 Hawker Hunter Mk 50s (equivalent to the Mk 4) was therefore signed on 29 June 1954 and the first aircraft was delivered on 26 August 1955. The model was designated J 34 and was assigned to the F 8 and F 18 wings that defended Stockholm. The J 34 was armed with four 30mm (1.18in) cannon and two Sidewinders. The Swedish Air Force's <b>aerobatic</b> team Acro Hunters used five J 34s during the late 1950s. The J 34s were gradually replaced by supersonic J 35 Draken and reassigned to less prominent air wings, F 9 in Gothenburg and F 10 in Ängelholm, during the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{stayed on}} Malta {{and took a}} flight in a {{transport}} aircraft on 6 March, winning the shilling bet. He embarked in HMS Defender on 22 March to return to Britain. He toured Egypt and then took a detour to Athens, Greece. The Axis had invaded Greece and Yugoslavia on 6 April and the Battle of Greece {{was on the verge}} of an out come within two weeks and MacLachlan was evacuated back to Egypt. He flew down the Nile River into Sudan and Kenya in a captured German Junkers Ju 52 and piloted the aircraft himself on 24 April. Stopping at various airfields he flew when he could. On one such occasion he flew a North American T-6 Texan in an <b>aerobatic</b> sortie. He reached South Africa on 10 May. He flew home on a Boeing 314 Clipper via Lagos, Bathurst in Gambia, Lisbon, Portugal, Dublin, Ireland arriving in Bristol on 7 August.|$|E
5|$|Permission {{was granted}} for flight testing {{to begin in}} April 1935, and Bajdak {{conducted}} his first flight in the prototype on 22 April 1935. For this initial uneventful flight, no weapons were installed and a light fuel load was used. The following day, Bajdak put the IK-1 into unplanned <b>aerobatic</b> manoeuvres, after which the wing fabric was observed as being slack. An official from Ikarus checked it and stated that this would resolve once the fabric varnish had completely dried. Bajdak took the aircraft for a third test flight the next day, which involved more unplanned aerobatics. When the aircraft was at , Bajdak {{put it into a}} shallow dive and pulled up abruptly at high speed, at which point the wing fabric began to tear rapidly, {{to the extent that it}} could be seen from the ground. The aircraft dropped into a spin to starboard, and Bajdak baled out safely while the IK-1 crashed into the ground.|$|E
5|$|The First of the Few (also {{known as}} Spitfire in the US and Canada) (1942) was a British film {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Leslie Howard, with Howard in the starring role of R.J. Mitchell, and David Niven playing a composite character based on the Schneider Trophy pilots of 1927, 1929 and 1931, and the Supermarine test pilot Jeffrey Quill. Some of the footage includes film shot in 1941 of operational Spitfires and pilots of 501 Squadron (code letters SD). Howard {{spent a long time}} researching the history of the Spitfire's development for the film; Mrs. Mitchell and her son Gordon were on the set during much of the production. The <b>aerobatic</b> flying sequences featured in the last 15 minutes of the film were made by Jeffrey Quill in early November 1941, flying a Spitfire Mk II mocked up to represent the prototype.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform <b>aerobatic</b> maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E
5|$|Artists Mike Marsicano and Kurt Bickenbach played {{critical}} {{roles in}} the creation of the game's aircraft models, which were built in 3D Studio. As reference material, the team photographed real planes at several airfields, and they received blueprints and datasheets from aircraft manufacturers. The game's Grob G103a Twin II sailplane was based directly on the one that Blackley owned at the time. The sophistication of the real-time CFDs complicated the 3D modeling process, as the planes required accurate geometry to fly properly. While attempting to meet this goal, however, Bickenbach said that the models he created were overly detailed, which caused the team to struggle with performance issues related to the high number of polygons. Reducing the number altered the plane's shape, which in turn reduced its flight realism; this necessitated a balance between performance and accuracy. To obtain audio for the planes, Greg LoPiccolo and Tom Streit—former bassist and road manager, respectively, of the band Tribe—visited a Florida importer of Russian <b>aerobatic</b> aircraft. The two placed microphones inside the cockpits and next to the engines, and they flew each plane at multiple speeds while recording with a digital audio tape machine. Combining this material with digital recordings of wind sounds, the team fashioned a physics-based sound system: sounds of the wind and engine are altered in real-time based on wind speed in the game.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{travelled}} {{to flight}} schools across America. In November {{he flew to}} Orlando, Florida and across to Galveston, Texas near Palm Beach. The lecturing tour took him to Los Angeles California {{at the end of}} 1942. By January 1943 he had also visited Arizona and Texas. His flight log had expanded throughout this period to include a variety of types. Using his privileged position he flew the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Lockheed P-38 Lightning and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. Through flying MacLachlan felt the urge to participate in combat operations again but he enjoyed American hospitality immensely. In February he flew at an <b>aerobatic</b> show in Mesa, Arizona. On 18 February 1943 MacLachlan had a close call. While flying from Fort Stockton to El Paso, he force-landed in the desert when he ran out of fuel. According to a legend, MacLachaln used a local pipeline to fill the tanks. While in America he undertook several public relations tours and met movie stars such as Orson Wells and Joan Fontaine when he visited Hollywood for autographed photo-shoots.|$|E
5|$|Major air shows held {{regularly}} {{include the}} Duxford Air Show, the Flying Legends show (organised by The Fighter Collection), and American Air Day, which {{is held in}} conjunction with units of the Third Air Force (part of the United States Air Forces in Europe), based at nearby RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall. The Duxford Air Show usually exhibits {{a wide range of}} aircraft, from vintage warbirds to contemporary jet aircraft, along with <b>aerobatic</b> flying by groups such as the Red Arrows. while the Flying Legends show focuses on historic aircraft, especially those of the Second World War. In 2008 it was reported that these displays generate up to £1.8 million, while the loss of up to £100,000 due to adverse weather is also budgeted for. The policing bill, necessary to manage the resulting road traffic, was reported as some £8,000. Recent major events have included the Battle of Britain 70th Anniversary airshow, held on 4–5 September 2010. The show was attended by more than 40,000 people, and featured formation displays by four Hawker Hurricanes and sixteen Spitfires.|$|E

25|$|Arnie Meneghelli is {{the number}} 2 pilot {{and the owner of}} the Flying Lions <b>Aerobatic</b> Team. He has flown many {{aircraft}} types including Extras, Pitts and Zlins. Meneghelli also flies as the right wingman of the Gabriel Wings <b>Aerobatic</b> Team.|$|E
25|$|Several {{well known}} pilots used them as <b>aerobatic</b> aircraft, {{including}} Gerhard Fieseler who {{was regarded as}} {{the best and most}} innovative <b>aerobatic</b> pilot of his day. In September 1927 he claimed a world duration record for inverted flight in his Schwalbe KL.IC. at a Zurich meeting, then bettered it later in the month with a fifteen minute flight. He gave <b>aerobatic</b> demonstrations in his Schwalbe during 1927-8 at several other European meetings including Blackpool and Waalhaven.|$|E
25|$|The X1 was {{originally}} designed as an <b>aerobatic</b> aircraft and was tested to +9/-6.6 g before failure and carries operational limits of +6.6/-4.4 g. The full-span ailerons also give the X1 a fast roll-rate. For liability reasons the X1 was never marketed as an <b>aerobatic</b> design.|$|E
