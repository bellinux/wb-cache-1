Due to the distance of the Bureau of Forestry in Manila from the Forest School in Los Baños (about 64 kilometers), directors of the bureau appointed foresters-in-charge to manage the school, a practice which continued until 1957.|$|E

40|$|The {{leadership}} {{of learning and}} teaching (L&T) in higher education has evolved over recent years. Part of the evolutionary process has seen {{the rise of the}} appointment of <b>Associate</b> <b>Deans</b> L&T (Academic, Education, inter alia). Implicit in this role is the assumption by many that <b>associate</b> <b>deans</b> are responsible for leading L&T. Through interviews with 25 <b>associate</b> <b>deans</b> with one or more creative arts disciplines within their remit, we explore the {{leadership of}} the L&T landscape of the creative arts. We specifically consider the associate deans&# 039; understanding of the leadership of L&T, and their perspectives on who is responsible for the leadership of L&T for the creative arts. Collectively, <b>associate</b> <b>deans</b> articulated a sophisticated understanding of L&T leadership, including the words vision, innovation, strategic thinking, communication, translation, advocacy and influence. However, the variation in individual descriptions of leadership aspects according to the three L&T leadership conceptions identified by Marshall and colleagues [(2011). Leading and managing learning and teaching in higher education. Higher Education Research & Development, 30 (2), 87 - 103], ranged from low level understanding to high level understanding based on an analysis using the Structured Observed Learning Outcomes taxonomy [Biggs, J., & Collis, K. (1982). Evaluating the quality of learning: The SOLO taxonomy. New York: Academic Press]. When it came to who was leading L&T, there were diverse views ranging from &# 039;me&# 039; to &# 039;no one&# 039;. The research suggests that the key to <b>associate</b> <b>deans</b> articulating a more sophisticated view of leadership of L&T may be through attaining a L&T qualification; having experience in the role; and publishing in the discipline of higher education L&T. These findings may guide those recruiting into the field of leadership of L&T, and be helpful for those who are planning a career in the area...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{findings}} from a Leadership Foundation for Higher Education funded project exploring {{the role of}} <b>Associate</b> <b>Deans</b> in UK universities. While the number of <b>Associate</b> <b>Deans</b> leading cross-curricular and inter-disciplinary initiatives {{appears to be on}} the increase, there has been very little research focusing on the exact nature of the role and its importance, or otherwise, in the leadership and management of universities. Drawing on mixed-methods data from 15 semi-structured interviews and a follow up online survey (n= 172), this paper reports on how the role is defined and positioned in relation to university organisational structures and identifies what the similarities and differences are between <b>Associate</b> <b>Deans</b> working at traditional and modern universities. As the first national survey of the role, it is argued that this paper makes a significant and original contribution to knowledge. By drawing on the concept of distributed leadership, the paper also offers new theoretical insights into how different types of universities in the UK are responding to external pressures {{as a consequence of the}} fast changing and increasingly complex sector environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{undergraduate}} business program rankings in USNWR {{are based}} solely on peer assessments from <b>deans</b> and <b>associate</b> <b>deans</b> of AACSB accredited U. S. business schools. Often these reputation-based rankings are discounted and likened to a beauty pageant because the process lacks transparent input data. In this study, ten <b>deans</b> and ten <b>associate</b> <b>deans</b> representing top 50 USNWR undergraduate business programs were interviewed. Seven of the institutions are public and three are private and all but two universities are AAU member institutions. The research answers the following questions: how do <b>deans</b> and <b>associate</b> <b>deans</b> define quality in their school's undergraduate program and in other schools' programs? How are administrators influenced when evaluating the reputation of peer schools? Are competitors treated differently when evaluating academic reputation? What methods are administrators utilizing to influence brand perception with their stakeholder and educational peers?Business school <b>deans</b> and <b>associate</b> <b>deans</b> emphasized different aspects of an undergraduate program in their description of quality. The deans most valued quality from faculty and research. The <b>associate</b> <b>deans</b> valued the undergraduate experience including sense of community, engagement, involvement, leadership, student services, as creating distinction in a program. Business school administrators are barraged by influences that affect their perceptions about program reputations. Overall the influences on perception included quality of faculty, research, student standardized test scores, resources, characteristics of an institution, professional involvement and social networks including networks with faculty, students, other professionals and employers that provide feedback about schools. Professional involvement and social networks (PhD students, other deans, siblings, friends, students, employers, etc.) provided administrators with important insight into academic reputation. The quality of people that the administrators knew from other schools {{made a difference in}} peer schools' reputation. Finally, most schools employ integrated marketing communication (IMC) including taglines, direct marketing, event marketing, feature promotions, customer service and brand messages to influence stakeholders and peers. This study confirmed that everyone in a business school is a brand manager because brand is influenced through numbers of interactions over time with a variety of stakeholders. True to the IMC framework, business schools have moved to a relationship driven educational model...|$|R
