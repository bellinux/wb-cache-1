50|$|Injera fit-fit (var. enjera fetfet; also taita fit-fit in Tigrinya) is a {{combination}} of shredded injera, berbere, onions, and clarified butter. Variations on this basic recipe are common in which the name of the additional item is commonly used as a prefix. For instance, if one were to add shiro (chickpeas puree), the resulting dish would be called shiro fit-fit. If one were to <b>add</b> <b>broth</b> (mereq) it would be called mereq fit-fit.|$|E
50|$|People in {{the north}} of Vietnam tend to use nước mắm pha, as cooked by using the above recipes, but <b>add</b> <b>broth</b> made from pork loin and penaeid shrimp (tôm he). In the central section of the country, people like using a less dilute form of nước mắm pha that has the same {{proportions}} of fish sauce, lime, and sugar as the recipe above, but less water, and with fresh chili. Southern Vietnamese people often use palm sugar and coconut water as the sweetener.|$|E

5000|$|Mushroom dark soy ( [...] cǎogū lǎochōu): In the {{finishing}} and aging {{process of making}} dark soy sauce, the broth of Volvariella volvacea (straw mushroom) is mixed into the soy sauce and is then exposed to the sun to make this type of dark soy. The <b>added</b> <b>broth</b> gives this soy sauce a richer flavor than plain dark soy sauce.|$|R
50|$|Jeongol is a Korean-style hot pot made {{by putting}} meat, mushroom, seafood, seasoning, etc., in a stew pot, <b>adding</b> <b>broth,</b> and boiling it. It {{is similar to}} the {{category}} of Korean stews called jjigae, with the main difference being that jjigae are generally made with only a single main ingredient, and named after that ingredient (such as kimchi jjigae or sundubu jjigae), while jeongol usually contain a variety of main ingredients. An additional difference is that jeongol (like gujeolpan) was originally a dish for upper-class Koreans and members of the royal court, while jjigae was a simpler dish for commoners.|$|R
50|$|Take a young chicken, {{remove the}} neck and legs, and cut into large pieces at the joints. Sauté in 30 grams (about 1 ounce) of butter and one {{tablespoon}} of olive oil, seasoning with salt, pepper, {{and a dash of}} nutmeg. When the pieces have browned on both sides, skim the fat and add a level tablespoon of flour and a deciliter (about 7 fluid ounces) of wine. <b>Add</b> <b>broth</b> and cover, cooking over low heat until done. Before removing from the fire, garnish with a pinch of chopped parsley; arrange on a serving dish and squeeze half a lemon over it. The result is an appetizing dish.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{personal}} preference, {{a wide array}} of ingredients may be used. A whole onion, a head of garlic, and sliced ginger may be charred and then <b>added</b> to the <b>broth</b> to give it a more intense flavor and aroma. Whenever garlic is used, the Lao typically do not shy away from using a lot of it. Charred lemongrass, sliced galanga, the white bottom of green onions, fresh cilantro stems, and fresh Asian basil stems may also be <b>added</b> to the <b>broth</b> for an additional Lao flair. Celery stalks and optional carrots are sliced and then <b>added</b> to the <b>broth</b> to round out the flavors.|$|R
50|$|Antimicrobial {{susceptibility}} testing (AST) {{can be done}} on 96-well plates by diluting the {{antimicrobial agent}} at varying concentrations in broth inoculated with bacteria and measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration that results in no growth. However, these methods cannot be used to study some membrane-active antimicrobial peptides, which are inhibited by the broth itself. The virtual colony count procedure takes advantage of this fact by first exposing bacterial cells to the active antimicrobial agent in a low-salt buffer for two hours, then simultaneously inhibiting antimicrobial activity and inducing exponential growth by <b>adding</b> <b>broth.</b> The growth kinetics of surviving cells can then be monitored using a temperature-controlled plate reader.|$|R

40|$|In this study，the {{effect of}} {{arginine}} (Arg) of the NaCl induced growth inhibition was examined for Sta. carnosus and P. acidilactici which {{isolated from the}} commercial starter culture of fermented sausage. When Arg and/or NaCl were <b>added</b> to MRS <b>broth</b> and cultured with shaking，the differences were not recorded in the broth pH，the nitrate reduction activity，and the protein degradation activity. However，the viable count of both strains had decreased by adding NaCl. The addition of Arg has {{increased the number of}} recovered cell and it was remarkable in Sta. carnosus. Arg <b>added</b> <b>broth</b> was metabolized by both strain，the content of Arg in broth was decreased， especially it was disappeared in cultured broth of Sta. carnosus. SEM photographs showed an enlarged and cohesive morphology of both spheroidal strains by adding NaCl to the broth. Addition of Arg，this tendency was decreased in P. acidilactici，whereas a small wrinkle on the surface of Sta. carnosus. It was thought that，the two bacterial strains used in this study，the growth inbibitory effect caused by high concentration of NaCl was partly recovered by the addition of Arg to the broth. 本研究では，醗酵肉製品用のスターターとして用い られているStaphylococcus carnosus およびPediococcus acidilacticiを供試菌として高濃度の食塩による生育阻害に対するアルギニンの効果を検討した. MRS液体培地に食塩あるいはアルギンニンを添加して振盪培養を行うと，培養後の培地pH，硝酸塩還元活性およびタンパク質分解活性には両供試菌ともに食塩あるいはアルギニンの有無による差異が認められなかった. 生菌数は食塩の添加によって減少したが，アルギニン を添加すると食塩による減少が軽減され，これはSta. carnosusで著しかった. 両供試菌ともに添加したアルギニンは培地中で減少し，特に，Sta. carnosusでは 枯渇した. 一方，食塩あるいはアルギニンの添加は乾燥 菌体のアミノ酸組成に大きな影響を与えなかった. 走査型電子顕微鏡像から，両供試菌ともに食塩の添加は 菌体の膨化，凝集を促し，アルギニンの添加によって P. acidilacticiでは，この傾向が低したが，Sta. carnosusでは菌体表面に皺様の構造が観察された. 以上 の結果から，今回用いた供試菌において，添加した アルギニンは資化され食塩による生育阻害に対して 緩和的に作用するものと考えられた.

40|$|Propionibacteria {{derived from}} dairy {{products}} are relevant starter cultures {{for the production}} of Swiss and Emmental-type cheeses, and the monitoring of which is mandatory for proper quality control. This study aimed to evaluate an alternative procedure to enumerate propionibacteria, in order to develop a reliable and practical methodology to be employed by dairy industries. 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) inhibitory activity was tested against five reference strains (CIRM 09, 38, 39, 40 and 116); TTC at 0. 0025 % (w/v) was not inhibitory, {{with the exception of one}} strain (CIRM 116). Subsequently, the four TTC-resistant strains, three commercial starter cultures (PS- 1, PB-I, and CHOO) and twelve Emmental-type cheese samples were subjected to propionibacteria enumeration using Lithium Glycerol (LG) agar, and Petrifilm (TM) Aerobic Count (AC) plates <b>added</b> to LG <b>broth</b> (anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees C for 7 d). Petrifilm (TM) AC <b>added</b> to LG <b>broth</b> presented high counts than LG agar (P< 0. 05) for only two reference strains (CIRM 39, and 40) and for all commercial starter cultures. Cheese sample counts obtained by both procedures did not show significant differences (P< 0. 05). Significant correlation indexes were observed between the counts recorded by both methods (P< 0. 05).

Clinically, 83 % of the patients were cured or improved, and 64 % of the Pseudomonas isolates were eliminated by chemotherapy. The 74 clinical isolates and 38 additional isolates with known mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance were tested in three separate laboratories by disk diffusion methods and by microdilution tests with three broth media (Mueller-Hinton broth with full, half, and no cation supplements). Isolates that responded to netilmicin therapy and those that failed to respond were all susceptible by the disk test, and most were susceptible by microdilution tests with unsupplemented broth. However, {{over half of the}} clinical isolates appeared to be resistant when cations were <b>added</b> to the <b>broth</b> medium. Strains capable of producing enzymes that inactivate netilmicin were resistant by all methods tested. Broth dilution and agar dilution results were most comparable when half of the recommended cation supplements was <b>added</b> to Mueller-Hinton <b>broth.</b> Further consideration should be given to reducing the concentration of cations that are <b>added</b> to Mueller-Hinton <b>broth</b> when netilmicin susceptibility tests are being performed.
