40|$|We {{develop a}} ray optics {{model of a}} silicon <b>wire</b> <b>array</b> {{geometry}} {{in an attempt to}} understand the very strong absorption previously observed experimentally in these arrays. Our model successfully reproduces the n^ 2 ergodic limit for <b>wire</b> <b>arrays</b> in free space. Applying this model to a <b>wire</b> <b>array</b> on a Lambertian back reflector, we find an asymptotic increase in light trapping for low filling fractions. In this case, the Lambertian back reflector is acting as a wide acceptance angle concentrator, allowing the array to exceed the ergodic limit in the ray optics regime. While this leads to increased power per volume of silicon, it gives reduced power per unit area of <b>wire</b> <b>array,</b> owing to reduced silicon volume at low filling fractions. Upon comparison with silicon microwire experimental data, our ray optics model gives reasonable agreement with large <b>wire</b> <b>arrays</b> (4 μm radius), but poor agreement with small <b>wire</b> <b>arrays</b> (1 μm radius). This suggests that the very strong absorption observed in small <b>wire</b> <b>arrays,</b> which is not observed in large <b>wire</b> <b>arrays,</b> may be significantly due to wave optical effects...|$|R

Jet and ambient plasmas are formed during the z-pinch discharge of a 1. 4 MA, 240 ns current pulse delivered by Imperial College London's MAGPIE generator. Jets are of centimetre length and microsecond lifetime but have sufficiently large Reynolds and Péclet numbers (> 10, 000) to permit well-scaled comparison with non-magnetised astrophysical jets, including the bipolar outflows of protostars. Jet densities are of order 10 e 19 particles per cubic centimetre, and density ratios (jet density/ambient density) between 1 and 10, are demonstrated. Jets are formed by ablation of micrometer thickness aluminium (Al) or tungsten (W) wires arranged in the conical or radial <b>wire</b> <b>array</b> z-pinch geometries. Ambient plasmas are formed {{during the same}} current pulse by ablation of wires in the cylindrical <b>wire</b> <b>array</b> geometry, or {{the surface of a}} 14 micrometre thickness, 40 mm diameter aluminium foil.

Sparse arrays of these structures exhibit enhanced absorption due to strong coupling {{into the first}} order azimuthal waveguide modes of individual nanowires; wire radius thus controls the spectral region of the absorption enhancement.
