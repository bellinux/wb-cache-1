[...] He was also famously sharp in conversation. Gilbert Ryle, one of Williams's mentors at Oxford, said that he [...] "understands what you're going to say better than you understand it yourself, and sees <b>all</b> the <b>possible</b> objections to it, and <b>all</b> the <b>possible</b> answers to <b>all</b> the <b>possible</b> objections, before you've got to the end of your own sentence." ...|$|R

5|$|By {{allowing}} u to vary over <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> integers, {{an infinite}} family of solutions {{can be generated}} from a single solution (x1,y1). If the solutions are required to be positive integers (x>0,y>0), only {{a finite number of}} solutions may be possible. This restriction on the acceptable solutions allows some systems of Diophantine equations with more unknowns than equations to have a finite number of solutions; this is impossible for a system of linear equations when the solutions can be any real number (see Underdetermined system).|$|E
5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. Often these {{techniques are}} designed for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E

5|$|Evaluating {{pesticide}} {{contributions to}} CCD is particularly difficult for several reasons. First, {{the variety of}} pesticides in use in the different areas reporting CCD {{makes it difficult to}} test for <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> pesticides simultaneously. Second, many commercial beekeeping operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances {{over the course of a}} season, potentially exposing the colonies to different pesticides at each location. Third, the bees themselves place pollen and honey into long-term storage, effectively meaning a delay may occur from days to months before contaminated provisions are fed to the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time when exposure to pesticides occurred.|$|E
5|$|Hidden Markov {{models are}} {{probabilistic}} models that can assign likelihoods to <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> combinations of gaps, matches, and mismatches {{to determine the}} most likely MSA or set of possible MSAs. HMMs can produce a single highest-scoring output but can also generate a family of possible alignments that can then be evaluated for biological significance. HMMs can produce both global and local alignments. Although HMM-based methods have been developed relatively recently, they offer significant improvements in computational speed, especially for sequences that contain overlapping regions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the {{deciphering}} of the Maya hieroglyphic script, scholars have come to understand that it was a fully functioning writing system in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is of a type best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or graphemes) can be used as either logograms or syllables. The script has a complete syllabary (although not <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe {{would have been able to}} write anything phonetically, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.|$|E

About 400 people in the town were left homeless by Cyclone Kathy. By 25March, a Royal Australian Air Force aircraft was sent to the region carrying emergency supplies for sheltering displaced persons. Two patrol boats from the Royal Australian Navy were also sent to assist in relief efforts. One brought fuel and medical supplies and the other assisted trawlers set adrift or grounded by the storm. Following its usage, the name Kathy was retired from Brisbane's list of cyclone names and will never be used again.|$|E

Ladislaus then invaded the Kőszegis's domains in Transdanubia, but could not defeat them.

5|$|One {{can form}} a 2-satisfiability {{instance}} at random, {{for a given}} number n of variables and m of clauses, by choosing each clause uniformly at random from the set of <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> two-variable clauses. When m is small relative to n, such an instance will likely be satisfiable, but larger values of m have smaller probabilities of being satisfiable. More precisely, if m/n is fixed as a constant α ≠ 1, the probability of satisfiability tends to a limit as n goes to infinity: if α<1, the limit is one, while if α>1, the limit is zero. Thus, the problem exhibits a phase transition at α=1.|$|E
