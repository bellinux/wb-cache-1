5|$|<b>A</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> native form {{of poetic}} {{literature}} in Kannada called Vachanas developed during this time. They {{were written by}} mystics, who expressed their devotion to God in simple poems that could appeal to the masses. Basavanna, Akka Mahadevi, Allama Prabhu, Channabasavanna and Siddharama are the best known among them.|$|E
5|$|Citizens had <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> {{powerful}} influence in neighborhood government. Neighborhoods coordinated activities under the Neighborhood Revitalization Program (NRP), {{which ended in}} 2009. Minneapolis is divided into communities, each containing neighborhoods. In some cases two or more neighborhoods act together under one organization. Some areas are commonly known by nicknames of business associations.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} brands ran {{commercials}} {{tied to the}} 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company General Motors aired an advertisement during the annual Super Bowl football game in which {{a group of friends}} drove Chevrolet Silverados through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, Jell-O ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at Boston University, questioned the utility of tying large sums of money to such <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> short-term event.|$|E

They conducted security operations and search and rescue missions throughout New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|New Thought and Christian Science {{differed}} in that Eddy saw her views as <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> final revelation. Eddy's idea of malicious animal magnetism marked another distinction (that {{people can be}} harmed by the bad thoughts of others), introducing an element of fear that was absent from the New Thought literature. Most significantly, she dismissed the material world as an illusion, rather than as merely subordinate to Mind, leading her to reject the use of medicine, or materia medica, and making Christian Science the most controversial of the metaphysical groups. Reality for Eddy was purely spiritual.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} region bordering Spanish and Portuguese territories in South America {{was largely}} unexplored {{at the end}} of the 17th century. Dispatched by the Spanish Crown, Jesuits explored and founded eleven settlements in 76 years in the remote Chiquitania – then known as Chiquitos – on the frontier of Spanish America. They built churches (templos) in <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> distinct style that combined elements of native and European architecture. The indigenous inhabitants of the missions were taught European music as a means of conversion. The missions were self-sufficient, with thriving economies, and virtually autonomous from the Spanish crown.|$|E

5|$|The nuckelavee is {{a mythical}} sea {{creature}} that {{appears as a}} horse-like demon when it ventures onto land. Writer and folklorist Ernest Marwick considered it {{very similar to the}} Norwegian nøkk, the nuggle of the Shetlands and the kelpie. <b>A</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> solitary creature possessing extensive evil powers, its malevolent behaviour can influence events throughout the islands. Islanders were terrified of the creature and would not speak its name without immediately saying a prayer. It was often found in the vicinity of a beach, but would never come ashore if it was raining.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the process came with {{proposals}} released in 1995 by the Honours Advisory Committee that reviewed the honours system. Until May 1996, New Zealand made recommendations for various British awards for acts of gallantry performed during military operations and acts of bravery by civilians including the Victoria Cross and George Cross. However, the British Government's review and simplification of their awards system provided an ideal opportunity for New Zealand to also develop <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> simplified system.|$|E
5|$|When released, Raptor Red was {{generally}} praised: Bakker's anthropomorphism {{was seen as}} <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> positive aspect of the book, and his writing was described as folksy and heartfelt. Criticisms of the novel included a perceived lack of characterization and average writing. Some scientists, such as paleontologist David B. Norman, took issue with the scientific theories portrayed in the novel, fearing that the public would accept them as fact, while Discovery Channel host Jay Ingram defended Bakker's creative decisions in an editorial.|$|E

5|$|Devil Daggers is {{a shooter}} video game with {{gameplay}} experienced from a first-person perspective. The {{goal of the}} game is to kill demonic enemies and survive for as long as possible. Devil Daggers opens with the player character standing in a shadowy room; in front of them is a floating dagger illuminated by a spotlight. Upon retrieving the dagger, the player is transported to a flat, floating platform arena cloaked in darkness. In the arena, demonic enemies begin spawning. Initially, a series of tentacled, towering creatures spawn and start releasing swarms of flying skulls that pursue the player. As time progresses, more exotic creatures that pose a greater threat and exhibit different behaviour begin to appear. Each enemy makes <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> continuous noise, so that the player is able to recognise what type of enemy is approaching them.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{and goats}} are closely related: both {{are in the}} {{subfamily}} Caprinae. However, they are separate species, so hybrids rarely occur, and are always infertile. A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a sheep-goat hybrid (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and {{is not to be}} confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep. Visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails of goats are held upwards. Also, sheep breeds are often naturally polled (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially). Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> strong odor during the rut, whereas rams do not.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} part of {{the building}} at Worcester is the multi-columned Norman crypt with cushion capitals remaining from the original monastic church begun by St Wulfstan in 1084. Also from the Norman period is the circular chapter house of 1120, made octagonal on the outside when the walls were reinforced in the 14th century. The nave was built and rebuilt piecemeal and in different styles by several different architects over a period of 200 years, some bays being <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> decorative transition between Norman and Gothic. It dates from 1170 to 1374. The east end was rebuilt over the Norman crypt by Alexander Mason between 1224 and 1269, coinciding with, and in a very similar Early English style to the greater part of Salisbury. From 1360 John Clyve finished off the nave, built its vault, the west front, the north porch and the eastern range of the cloister. He also strengthened the Norman chapter house, added buttresses and changed its vault. His masterpiece is the central tower of 1374, originally supporting a timber, lead-covered spire, now gone. Between 1404 and 1432 an unknown architect added the north and south ranges to the cloister, which was eventually closed by the western range by John Chapman, 1435–38. The last important addition is the Prince Arthur’s Chantry Chapel {{to the right of the}} south choir aisle, 1502–04.|$|E
