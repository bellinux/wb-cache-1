5|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} calls have been recorded from captive birds, including harsh, harmonic, chatter and whistle vocalisations. Harsh calls were made when <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> was alarmed or agitated, whistle-type calls were emitted in general contexts, sometimes monotonously, and shorter duration 'chatter' calls were given when <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> sighted a human near the enclosure.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two types}} of slope posture, a pre-copulatory one and an {{ordinary}} one. The pre-copulatory behavior of scaly-breasted munia includes a sequence of actions. The first involves either the male or female playing with nest-material. As soon as <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> has arranged the nest material in its bill, it begins to fly around in a zig-zag path. Once <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> lands close to its partner, the male bends towards the female and wipes its bill. The male then sings with movements of the body. The female invites mounting with tail quivering.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} fearless in defence of its nest and young, and, like other Strix owls, strikes for the intruder's head with its sharp talons. Because its flight is silent, {{it may not}} be {{detected}} until it is too late to avoid the danger. Dogs, cats and humans may be assaulted, sometimes without provocation. Perhaps the best-known victim of the tawny owl's fierce attack was the renowned bird photographer Eric Hosking, who lost his left eye when struck by <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> he was attempting to photograph near its nest in 1937. He later called his autobiography An Eye for <b>a</b> <b>Bird.</b>|$|E

50|$|A pellet, in ornithology, is {{the mass}} of undigested parts of <b>a</b> <b>bird's</b> food that some bird species {{occasionally}} regurgitate. The contents of <b>a</b> <b>bird's</b> pellet depend on its diet, but can include the exoskeletons of insects, indigestible plant matter, bones, fur, feathers, bills, claws, and teeth. In falconry, the pellet is called a casting.|$|R
5|$|Birdy {{builds a}} new aviary {{in his bedroom}} and {{purchases}} two canaries. He names the female Perta and the male Alfonso after his friend. Upon returning to school, Birdy encounters a classmate, Doris Robinson, and Al encourages him to ask her out on a date. At the prom, Birdy dances unenthusiastically with Doris, leaving her confused and humiliated. Afterwards, Doris drives him to a secluded spot, where Birdy lightly rejects her sexual advances. Birdy returns home to his bedroom and lies down naked in the aviary. In a semi-conscious state, he expresses {{that he wants to}} die and be born again as <b>a</b> <b>bird.</b> He then imagines himself flying like <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> around his room, throughout the house and outside in the neighborhood.|$|E
