500|$|This {{species is}} often listed in field guides as inedible, or not {{recommended}} for consumption due to its tough texture. Michael Kuo, in his 2007 book on edible mushrooms, lists the taste as [...] "mediocre", and comments [...] "the devil's urn is not <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{thought it was going}} to be. It's not good, mind you, but it would be possible to eat it with a forced smile if your Aunt Wanda served it to you." ...|$|E
500|$|Rodman {{experienced}} a tough loss when coach Chuck Daly, {{whom he had}} admired as a surrogate father, resigned in May; Rodman skipped the preseason camp and was fined $68,000. The following 1992–1993 season was even more tumultuous. Rodman and Annie Bakes, {{the mother of his}} daughter Alexis, were divorcing after a short marriage, an experience which left him traumatized. The Pistons won only 40games and missed the 1993 NBA Playoffs entirely. One night in February 1993, Rodman was found asleep in his car with a loaded rifle. Four years later in his biography <b>As</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> Wanna Be, he confessed having thought about suicide and described that night as an epiphany: [...] "I decided that instead [...] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn't want to go... So I just said, 'I'm going to live my life the way I want to live it and be happy doing it.' At that moment I tamed [...] my whole life around. I killed the person I didn't want to be." [...] The book was later adapted for a TV movie Bad As I Wanna Be: The Dennis Rodman Story. Although he had three years and $11.8million remaining on his contract, Rodman demanded a trade. On October 1, 1993, the Pistons dealt him to the San Antonio Spurs.|$|E
2500|$|His perfectionism was legendary; however, his {{relentless}} {{insistence on}} rehearsals and retakes was {{a burden to}} some. When time approached for the shooting of a number, Astaire would rehearse for another two weeks and record the singing and music. With all the preparation completed, the actual shooting would go quickly, conserving costs. Astaire agonized during the entire process, frequently asking colleagues for acceptance for his work. As Vincente Minnelli stated, [...] "He lacks confidence to the most enormous degree {{of all the people}} in the world. He will not even go to see his rushes... He always thinks he is no good." [...] As Astaire himself observed, [...] "I've never yet got anything 100% right. Still it's never <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> think it is." ...|$|E

6000|$|THE NEWSPAPER MAN [interested] <b>Is</b> he <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> that? <b>I</b> say: I am in luck to-day. Would {{you mind}} letting me {{photograph}} you? [He produces a camera]. Could {{you have a}} lancet or something in your hand? ...|$|R
2500|$|RUTH: Yes, sir, I were; I {{were brought}} {{up to be a}} thief. Every soul as I knowed was a thief, and the best thief was the best thought on. Maybe a kid not long born ought to have knowed better. I dunno, I must ha' been born bad, for it seemed right enough to me. Well, it was in prison and out o' prison—three months here and six months there—till I was sixteen. I {{sometimes}} thinks as if they'd bin half as ready to show me how to go right as they was to punish me for goin' wrong, I might have took the right turnin' and stuck to it afore this. At sixteen I got seven-year for shop-liftin', and was sent out to Port Phillip. I soon got a ticket and tried service and needlework, but no one wouldn't have me; and I got sick and tired of it all, and began to think o' putting an end to it, when I met a smooth-spoken chap—a gentleman, if you please—as wanted to save me from the danger afore me. Well, wot odds? He was a psalm-singing villain, and he soon left me. No need to tell the rest—to such as you it can't be told. I'm 'most <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can be—as bad as I can be! ...|$|E

6000|$|THE OLD WOMAN. A murderer! Oh, {{how dare}} they {{send me to}} herd with murderers! <b>I</b> was not <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> that: <b>I</b> was a good woman. There is some mistake: where can I have it set right? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They have no blood, those people! Their voices, their supercilious {{eyes that}} look {{you up and}} down! Oh! I've had so much of them! That woman with her Liberalism, just <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> any. <b>I</b> hate them all!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{might have}} gone farther off,' I said, {{brightening}} a little, 'and been <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> lost. <b>I</b> shall see you sometimes, my dear old Peggotty, there. You won't be quite {{at the other end}} of the world, will you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Martin feels <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> do at Tony's death, tho he doesn't {{say much}} of anything. [...] "Gosh, and Tony {{such a nice}} little cuss," [...] was about all he said, but he looked white around the gills.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} it is," [...] says Goodall, of Memphis, [...] "but I don't feel <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> did. An hour ago I wanted to die, but since I've met you, Miss Rosa, I'd like so much to live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A ---- bad job," [...] {{the other}} said, with an oath; [...] "about <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{ever had a}} hand in. Who {{would have thought that}} old cat would have held out against that? I know I could not have done it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ouh! Reomeo, Reomeo. Wherefore {{art thou}} Reomeo?" [...] said McTurk over his shoulder, quoting the Shakespeare artiste of last term. [...] "Well, he won't be <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> her, <b>I</b> hope. Stalky, are you {{properly}} patriotic? Because if you ain't, this chap's goin' to make you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do; {{you want}} me to be <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> yourself! Well, <b>I</b> won't. There! Mrs. Beale's <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> your father!" [...] Mrs. Wix went on.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't feel sure. It {{hurts me}} horribly to move. I fancy just at first I must have fainted. But I'm {{inclined}} to guess I'm only sprained and bruised and sore all over.

6000|$|If {{only she}} could keep him in this way! If he would only {{talk to her about}} {{anything}} but his passion! [...] "It seemed to me so, of course. Father was broken-hearted about it.

6000|$|... 'Na, na,' he said, 'no <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> that. <b>I</b> {{had been}} drinking, though. And to tell ye the God's truth, it's a thing I cannae mend.

6000|$|It {{was their}} first quarrel. Discreetly made up by Mrs. Bunker in some alarm at betraying herself; {{honestly}} forgiven by Zephas in a rude, remorseful consciousness of her limited life. One or two nights later, when he returned, {{it was with a}} mingled air of mystery and satisfaction.

6000|$|... "Perhaps {{things are}} not <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> they seem; <b>I</b> don't know much about such matters, but I 've seen people who have failed, and they seemed just as {{comfortable}} as before," [...] said Polly.|$|R
60|$|This was {{a strange}} {{testimony}} of the growing vice of the age, and such a one, that <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had been myself, it shocked my very senses.

6000|$|... "How can I go when I've got to {{mind this}} young one all the forenoon just 'cause the nurse must go an' have a sick headache?

6000|$|Or, {{if he is}} a poor man, he will say, 'Well, then, I {{will try}} and be more religious; I will think more about my soul, and come to church as often as I can, and say my prayers regularly, and read good books; and perhaps that will make my peace with God.
