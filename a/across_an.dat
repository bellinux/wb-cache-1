5|$|In many respects, Ranavalona's {{rule was}} a {{continuation}} of precedent established under Radama I. Both monarchs encouraged {{the introduction of new}} technologies and forms of knowledge from abroad, supported the establishment of an industrialized economy, and adopted measures to professionalize the army. Both viewed foreigners with ambivalence, establishing close personal relationships and drawing upon their expertise while enforcing restrictions on their activities to avert destabilizing changes to existing cultural and political systems. In addition, both contributed to the further development of a complex political bureaucracy that enabled the Merina court to govern remote provinces <b>across</b> <b>an</b> island larger than the Netherlands, Belgium and France combined.|$|E
5|$|Post-war {{growth in}} {{newspaper}} readership prompted an even larger, $3.5 million expansion in 1964 to fit eight-unit presses {{and a new}} three-story press room {{to the west of}} the printing plant. Four years later, an even larger $6 million addition would use up the last of the surface parking lots on the property's block, building a two-story newsroom clad in reinforced concrete instead of the limestone used on the 1931 building; a skybridge was built <b>across</b> <b>an</b> alley to connect to the older office building. In 1979, the new newsroom was renovated and modernized and a nearby alley was filled and enclosed.|$|E
50|$|An {{electrochemical}} gradient is a gradient of electrochemical potential, {{usually for}} an ion that can move <b>across</b> <b>a</b> membrane. The gradient {{consists of two}} parts, the chemical gradient, or difference in solute concentration <b>across</b> <b>a</b> membrane, and the electrical gradient, or difference in charge <b>across</b> <b>a</b> membrane. When there are unequal concentrations of <b>an</b> ion <b>across</b> <b>a</b> permeable membrane, the ion will move across the membrane from the area of higher concentration {{to the area of}} lower concentration through simple diffusion. Ions also carry an electric charge that forms <b>an</b> electric potential <b>across</b> <b>a</b> membrane. If there is an unequal distribution of charges across the membrane, then the difference in electric potential generates a force that drives ion diffusion until the charges are balanced {{on both sides of the}} membrane.|$|R

5|$|September 25, 2004– Hurricane Jeanne {{hits the}} {{southern}} {{portion of the}} state very near where Frances struck three weeks prior, producing moderate winds and rainfall reaching 11.97inches (304mm) at Kenansville. Jeanne produces hurricane-force winds <b>across</b> <b>an</b> area previously affected by one or two other hurricanes, causing about $3.5billion in damage (2004USD, $4.5billion 2017USD). The passage of Hurricane Jeanne results in three deaths; two due to winds and one from flooding.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization <b>across</b> <b>an</b> entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} produced {{heavy rainfall}} across its path, including in Haiti where precipitation caused devastating mudslides; over 3,000deaths {{were reported in}} the country. Heavy rainfall also occurred during its landfalls on Puerto Rico and Florida, resulting in river flooding. In its strongest landfall, the hurricane produced strong winds <b>across</b> <b>an</b> area earlier affected by Hurricane Frances and, in some locations, by Hurricane Charley. Late in its duration, the combination of moisture from Jeanne and cool air resulted in a tornado outbreak that extended from Georgia through the Mid-Atlantic states.|$|E

5|$|The {{reclamation}} of Chat Moss and Trafford Moss was innovative in {{that instead}} of constructing roads to give access for the material to be dumped onto the bog, a movable light railway was developed. Narrow gauge track– which allowed {{the weight of the}} wagons to be spread evenly <b>across</b> <b>an</b> area of the bog– was temporarily laid down and then picked up and relaid elsewhere as needed. Roscoe was declared bankrupt in 1821, but the reclamation work continued under the stewardship of others who took over his leasehold interest, amongst them William Baines, the anti-Corn Law MP and owner of the Leeds Mercury newspaper.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} had changed again by 1918, when tank attacks would have one tank every 100 or , with a tank company of 12–16 tanks per objective. One section of each {{company would be}} out in front, with {{the remainder of the}} company following behind and each tank providing protection for an infantry platoon, who were instructed to advance, making use of available cover and supported by machine gun fire. When the tanks came <b>across</b> <b>an</b> enemy strong point, they would engage the defenders, forcing them into shelter and leaving them to the devices of the following infantry.|$|E
5|$|Vargas Llosa rose to fame in the 1960s with novels such as The Time of the Hero (La ciudad y los perros, {{literally}} The City and the Dogs, 1963/1966), The Green House (La casa verde, 1965/1968), and {{the monumental}} Conversation in the Cathedral (Conversación en la catedral, 1969/1975). He writes prolifically <b>across</b> <b>an</b> array of literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (1973/1978) and Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.|$|E

5|$|Albion's sole goalscoring {{opportunity}} {{of the second}} half came afterwards; Clark took the ball on a lengthy run before crossing it into the box, <b>across</b> <b>an</b> open goal with no Albion player there to tap the ball in and put the game beyond QPR's reach. Fifteen minutes {{from the end of the}} match QPR equalised, Marsh's shot with his right foot went in off the post. A corner followed for QPR who were now dominating Albion with their style of play. Allen crossed it in to Lazarus, but the Albion goalkeeper saved the shot with his legs. With eight minutes to go, one of Albion defenders mis-kicked the ball in their own penalty area. Hunt rushed in for the chance but Sheppard once again saved the game for Albion. The ball ran free to Mike Lazarus who tapped the ball into the back of an empty net to increase the scoreline to 3–2 in QPR's favour. A final attack from QPR came in the closing moments of the game as Lazarus took the ball past two defenders and into the box, his subsequent shot hit the outside of the post and went wide.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{development}} of model membranes confirmed that the lipid bilayer is a stable structure that can exist independent of proteins. By “painting” a solution of lipid in organic solvent <b>across</b> <b>an</b> aperture, Mueller and Rudin were able to create an artificial bilayer and determine that this exhibited lateral fluidity, high electrical resistance and self-healing in response to puncture, all of which are properties of a natural cell membrane. A few years later, Alec Bangham showed that bilayers, in the form of lipid vesicles, could also be formed simply by exposing a dried lipid sample to water. This was an important advance, since it demonstrated that lipid bilayers form spontaneously via self assembly and do not require a patterned support structure.|$|E
5|$|Down {{from the}} slopes {{in front of}} Prokhorovka, the massed Soviet armour charged with five tank brigades of the 18th and 29th Tank Corps, firing as they came at Leibstandartes positions. As the Soviet tanks rolled down the slopes, they carried {{the men of the}} 9th Guards Airborne Division on their hulls. The troops of Leibstandarte were not slated to go into action until later in the day. Exhausted from the {{previous}} week's fighting, many were just starting their day {{at the outset of the}} attack. As the Soviet armour appeared, German outposts all across the corps' frontage began firing purple warning flares signalling a tank attack. Obersturmbannführer Rudolf von Ribbentrop, commander of a panzer company under the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment, stated that he knew at once a major attack was underway. He ordered his company of seven Panzer IVs to follow him over a bridge <b>across</b> <b>an</b> anti-tank ditch. Crossing the bridge they fanned out on the lower slope of Hill 252.2. On the crest of the hill, Sturmbannführer Joachim Peiper's 3rd Panzergrenadier Battalion of the 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment were being overrun.|$|E
