25|$|While the Great Plains {{were largely}} unfit for the {{cultivation}} of cotton, informed Southerners demanded that the West be open to slavery, often—perhaps most often—with minerals in mind. Brazil, for instance, {{was an example of}} the successful use of slave labor in mining. In the middle of the 18th century, diamond mining supplemented gold mining in Minas Gerais and accounted for a massive transfer of masters and slaves from Brazil's northeastern sugar region. Southern leaders knew <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> this experience. It was even promoted in the pro-slavery DeBow's Review as far back as 1848.|$|E
25|$|From 1836–7 Wheatstone {{had thought}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> {{submarine}} telegraphs, and in 1840 he gave evidence before the Railway Committee of the House of Commons on {{the feasibility of}} the proposed line from Dover to Calais. He had even designed the machinery for making and laying the cable. In the autumn of 1844, {{with the assistance of}} Mr. J. D. Llewellyn, he submerged a length of insulated wire in Swansea Bay, and signalled through it from a boat to the Mumbles Lighthouse. Next year he suggested the use of gutta-percha for the coating of the intended wire across the English Channel.|$|E
500|$|In late 1927, Burns {{published}} Tombstone, An Iliad of the Southwest, a mesmerizing tale [...] "of {{blood and}} thunder," [...] that christened Earp as the [...] "Lion of Tombstone". [...] "Strong, bold, forceful, picturesque was the fighter {{of the old}} frontier. Something epic in him, fashioned in Homeric mold. In his way, a hero." [...] It included <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> Wyatt as well, much to Wyatt and Josie's displeasure. Readers and reviewers found they {{had a difficult time}} discerning between [...] "fact and fiction." [...] The book was the first to popularize its subject for a mass reading audience. Burns treated Earp as a mythical figure, a [...] "larger-than-life hero whose many portrayals in film, television, and books often render fidelity to truth the first casualty." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon release, {{the album}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{from the music}} press, with Billboard magazine predicting that [...] "the Byrds will be riding high on the LP charts again with this top rock package." [...] Pete Johnson in the Los Angeles Times was more cautious, noting that [...] "the album is a good one, {{but it would be}} sad if it served as a monument, marking the end of the Byrds' development. There is little to distinguish it from their previous LPs in terms of creativity." [...] A resoundingly positive review came from the pen of Peter Reilly, writing in Hi-Fi/Stereo Review, who described the record as [...] "an enjoyable and well-made album which, if listened to closely enough, explains <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> what is going on around us." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the series, Allen {{refused to}} use Bodyline tactics, and openly said so within the team. His {{attitude}} made him popular with Australian spectators. Jardine twice {{tried to force}} the issue. Before the first Test, he asked Allen to bowl more bouncers with fielders on the leg side; Allen refused, saying {{he did not want}} to play cricket like that and that Jardine should leave him out if he was not happy. Prior to the second Test, Jardine again approached Allen and said that Larwood and Voce wanted him to bowl short, and believed that he only refused because he wanted to maintain his popularity. Allen wrote home: [...] "Well, I burst and said <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> swollen-headed, gutless, uneducated miners." [...] Allen threatened not to play, and to go home to relate the events of the tour to the press. Jardine did not pursue the matter. Others in the team also opposed Bodyline. The Nawab of Pataudi refused to field in the [...] "leg trap"—the ring of fielders positioned on the leg side to catch deflections from short deliveries—during the first Test. Allen had no compunction fielding there; at short leg he held five catches from Larwood's bowling in the series. Upon his return to England, Allen continued to oppose Bodyline tactics, making his opinion known to senior figures in the MCC, and leading a debate among county representatives which resulted in legislation to ban the tactic after the 1934 season.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 June 1934, {{he went to}} hear Erich Klausener at the Catholic Congress in Berlin and {{informed}} Heydrich that Klausener had made anarchist statements. On 30 June 1934, Klausener was shot by SS officer Kurt Gildisch {{in his office at}} the Prussian transportation ministry. After the war, Walter Schellenberg {{the former head of the}} foreign intelligence section of the SD in the RHSA, described Meisinger as:"One of the most evil creatures among Heydrich's bunch of thugs and he carried out the vilest of his orders...He was a frightening individual, a large, coarse-faced man with a bald head and an incredibly ugly face. However, like many men of his type, he had drive and energy and an unscrupulous sort of cleverness...As a result of his long police experience he knew <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> the workings and methods of the Comintern." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the closure}} of the {{original}} Sublime Society in 1867, three separate efforts have been made to revive it in various forms. Sir Henry Irving, as proprietor of the Lyceum Theatre, had possession within his theatre of the society's last premises. [...] From about 1878 until his death in 1905, he hosted dinners in the society's dining room. [...] A biographer of Irving wrote, [...] "He wanted the Lyceum to have the same educational and intellectual force that Phelps' theatre had enjoyed in lslington." [...] A contemporary newspaper reported, [...] "Almost as soon as Mr. Irving undertook the management of the Lyceum he restored this venerable sanctuary to something like its former appearance, and very often now it is the scene of the informal and bright little supper parties which he delights to bring about him. … If the nocturnal gatherings in the room were not of a private character we might say <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> them, especially as the guests frequently include men whose names are great." ...|$|E
