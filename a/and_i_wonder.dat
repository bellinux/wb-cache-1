500|$|In August, the {{preparations}} extended to laying depots; an early party established a depot [...] {{to the south}} of the main hut—a grotto in the ice known as Aladdin's Cave—but returned without the dogs. Mertz and two others set off to rescue the dogs, but in heavy winds covered less than a mile in two hours, and returned to the hut. [...] "If it depended only on me," [...] Mertz wrote in his diary, after four days' more wind confined them to the hut, [...] "we would be in our sleeping bags outside in the snow, and we would at least try to find the dogs. Mawson is definitely too cautious, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if he would show enough gumption during the sledging expedition." [...] The following day Mertz was part of a party of three that made it to Aladdin's Cave to rescue the dogs; when strong winds confined them to the depot for three days they spent the time expanding the cave.|$|E
2500|$|He wrote novels, short stories, plays, poetry, operas, essays, {{and works}} for children. [...] With the {{encouragement}} of his best friend and writer, Arna Bontemps, and patron and friend, Carl Van Vechten, he wrote two volumes of autobiography, The Big Sea <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Wonder</b> as I Wander, as well as translating several works of literature into English.|$|E
2500|$|I'm {{not sure}} about that. [...] was a free spirit... He was his own person {{when it came to}} {{different}} things. I would like to think he (would still be with Chicago), but he was very independent <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> what he would have thought about the 1980s. I'd have to say it's 50/50. It could have gone either way.|$|E
60|$|So she said, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered,</b> feeling trammelled <b>and</b> hurt. It did {{not make}} me free.|$|R
60|$|Pistol shots cracked behind me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> how Michelot was faring, but {{dared not}} pause to look.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> {{to myself}} to whom on earth they could ever mean {{against her will}} to marry her.|$|R
2500|$|I {{must confess}} I've still {{yet to be}} {{convinced}} that Cose is ready for test cricket. Last summer he earned his test place, and confirmed it with his century in Melbourne. But since then a question mark has arisen over his dedication to cricket, and also over his ability to play on wickets which are doing a bit. And he is definitely suspect outside his off stump. I'd like to see Gary work harder at his game. He appears to be overweight <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> how hard {{he is prepared to}} work at his batting at this stage.|$|E
2500|$|... "Better on the Other Side" [...] is a pop-ballad {{song that}} is four minutes thirty-six seconds long. The songs lyrics {{pertain to the}} {{influence}} of Jackson and his worldwide appeal and effect, as well as reflecting on their own personal memories of Jackson. The song instruments include a piano and a bass drop. [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] opens with a piano-accompanied soundscape starts off with Diddy [...] "testifying" [...] about Jackson's influence with the lyrics, [...] "I believed I can do anything," [...] he says. [...] "You made the world dance. You made the music come to life." [...] Then a [...] "thunderous bass drops" [...] in, led by Brown's vocals on the chorus, [...] "This the type of song that makes the angels cry/ Look up in the sky <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> why/ Why you had to go, go/ I know it's better on the other side." [...] The song concludes with one last statement from Diddy, [...] "People can say what they want about you. We gonna remember the miracles that you showed us. Through your music, through your dance. You were the one that made us realize that you are the world. Through us your legacy lives on, Mike Jackson." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Beautiful?" [...] cried Miss Desmond. [...] "It was my grandmother's name; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> they didn't call {{me for my}} great-grandmother, Daphne, and be {{done with}} it." ...|$|E
60|$|The Colonel {{stared into}} vacancy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> whether anyone {{could be quite}} so {{innocent}} of guile as he looked.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} about any snowballs," [...] said Codfish. [...] "I noticed the floor was all wet <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> what it meant." ...|$|R
6000|$|She creaked, [...] "O Mrs. Kennicott, I'm {{in such a}} fix. I'm {{supposed}} to lead the discussion, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> would you come and help?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a curious}} thing, dad, that the Frenchman should be coming {{backwards}} and forwards here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> that the revenue people don't inquire into it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Put {{it under}} the pump, lad. I will pump on it," [...] the coachman said. [...] "He's a bad-tempered brute, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> the squire keeps it." ...|$|E
60|$|This is my seventieth birthday, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if you {{all rise}} {{to the size of}} that proposition, realizing all the {{significance}} of that phrase, seventieth birthday.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} him, his proud, eagle face, and his tall, sinewy figure, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> {{whether in the}} whole land there was a finer, handsomer man.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And,</b> [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if <b>I</b> am aphoristic <b>and</b> subtle? <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if {{when she}} gets the rice-powder off, Claire isn't a lot more like Milt than she thought?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had no {{idea you}} were down here!" [...] <b>I</b> exclaimed; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> whether she didn't know me at all or knew me only by my voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it wouldn't do to put {{anything}} that wasn't pretty on a neck like that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> {{if you would}} let me fix it." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{they went}} along he said, [...] "Let {{us have a}} look at these bushes, Bertie. The soil is very thin about here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> that the trees grew." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You, Cap'n Kittridge! I {{wonder you}} can talk so," [...] said his wife. [...] "It's an awful responsibility, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> you don't think whether or no you're fit for it." ...|$|E
60|$|In my mind--and modestly--I {{asked for}} particulars, but Satan paid no {{attention}} to my thought. Next, my mind wandered to the astrologer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> where he might be.|$|R
60|$|Her {{face was}} black with shadow, {{but in her}} voice I caught a hint of tears, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> whether they were shed on my behalf or on her own.|$|R
60|$|I did {{not doubt}} it, yet I dared not make so bold as to confess it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> {{why they should}} laugh to hear her earnest censure of them.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder,</b> {{though perhaps}} {{he could not}} have told, what Aunt Anne would have done if Uncle Clarence had not been so forbearing before he went to China. CLARE FRITH.|$|E
6000|$|So I {{wait for}} another morn [...] And another night [...] In this soul-sick blight; [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> much [...] As I sit, why such A woman as I was born! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] {{said the}} boy. [...] "I {{wonder if the}} master of the Damoiseaux is as strict as that lady said, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> when I shall see Uncle Eustace again." ...|$|E
60|$|Steele's {{face was}} bloodless now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> {{if it had}} to do with her scathing scorn or {{something}} that he hid with his hand closing his coat that way.|$|R
5000|$|... … even long {{normal tissues}} {{differed}} markedly among themselves in NMR relaxation times, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> whether {{there might be}} some way to noninvasively map out such quantities within the body.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw they'd got to {{the agrarian}} laws of Caius Gracchus, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> if they knew {{anything}} about the agrarian troubles in Ireland. But all they knew about Ireland was that Dublin was on the Liffey. So <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> if they'd ever heard of General Gordon." ...|$|R
60|$|I incline to fatalistic submission. I suppose I had {{no power}} to leave him behind.... I wonder <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder.</b> The old Utopists never had to {{encumber}} themselves {{with this sort of}} man.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder Miggs {{was able}} to send a report at all, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> still more that you should put any faith in it," [...] his son said impatiently. [...] "The fellow is never sober." ...|$|E
6000|$|In my neighbor's windows the gas-lights flare, [...] As {{the dancers}} swing in a waltz of Strauss; [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> now could I fit that air [...] To {{the song of}} this sad old house.|$|E
60|$|So {{indeed it}} proved, for the mage began rapidly to divest himself of his mysterious swathings. Wrapper by wrapper he undid, cerement on cerement, till both Leonora <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> {{when he would}} stop.|$|R
60|$|But {{the stain}} upon our family {{was a source}} of unpleasantness to us. I fully {{believed}} my father innocent, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> if the time would ever come when his character would be cleared.|$|R
