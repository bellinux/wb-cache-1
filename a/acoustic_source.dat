40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a {{methodology}} to localize <b>acoustic</b> <b>sources</b> from the measurement of airborne induced vibrations of a thin structure. Targeted applications are the identification of <b>acoustic</b> <b>sources</b> through a thin wall, with a potential filtration of the incident field, which may be of practical interest for instance when identifying exterior <b>acoustic</b> <b>sources</b> from the inside of a moving vehicle. Two methods are coupled here to achieve this purpose : the Force Analysis Technique (FAT), used to identify the parietal pressure field exciting the thin structure from vibration measurements, and beamforming, used for the localization of <b>acoustic</b> <b>sources</b> from the (FAT-) identified parietal pressure. The coupling of the two methods is studied first from a theoretical point of view, and an experimental proof of concept is then presented, showing the feasibility and relevance of the proposed approach...|$|R

[...] A [...] "transceiver" [...] is an instrument incorporating both an <b>acoustic</b> <b>source</b> and a receiver. [...] The slight differences in travel {{time between the}} reciprocally-traveling signals are used to measure ocean currents, since the reciprocal signals travel with and against the current. [...] The average of these reciprocal travel times is the measure of temperature, with the small effects from ocean currents entirely removed. [...] Ocean temperatures are inferred from the sum of reciprocal travel times, while the currents are inferred from the difference of reciprocal travel times. [...] Generally, ocean currents (typically 10cm/s) have a much smaller effect on travel times than sound speed variations (typically 5m/s), so [...] "one-way" [...] tomography measures temperature to good approximation.|$|E

There exist several algorithms for source localization based on array signal processing. It is of interest to know the theoretical performance limits of these estimators.

40|$|Abstract In {{the present}} work, the {{generation}} and propagation of entropy noise is computed using a compressible URANS approach {{in combination with}} appropriate acoustic boundary conditions. The Entropy Wave Generator (EWG) experiment is best suited for validating the proposed approach and for investigating the <b>acoustic</b> <b>sources</b> of entropy noise. The EWG involves a non-reactive tube flow, where entropy modes are imposed to an incoming air flow by using a heating module. The generated temperature non-uniformities are accelerated with the mean flow downstream in a convergent divergent nozzle, thus producing entropy noise. Simulation results of pressure fluctuations and their spectra for a defined standard configuration {{as well as for}} diff erent operating points of the EWG agree very well with the respective experimental data. Additionally, an analysis of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>sources</b> was performed. For this purpose the <b>acoustic</b> <b>sources</b> caused by the acceleration of density inhomogeneities were calculated. For the first time, a numerical method is introduced for the localization of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>sources</b> of entropy noise in acceleration/deceleration regions. ...|$|R

When position and direction of the source is given, the strength of the source can be found using inverse method. On the other hand, considering the non-uniqueness of solution in inverse method, a different acoustic strength is obtained for the sources if different positions are selected. Selecting an arrangement of general source and using the optimization algorithm, the least possible mismatch between the main sound and the sound of equivalent sources can be achieved...|$|R
2500|$|Ocean {{acoustic}} tomography {{is a technique}} used to measure temperatures and currents over large regions of the ocean. [...] On ocean basin scales, this technique {{is also known as}} acoustic thermometry. [...] The technique relies on precisely measuring the time it takes sound signals to travel between two instruments, one an <b>acoustic</b> <b>source</b> and one a receiver, separated by ranges of 100–5000km. [...] If the locations of the instruments are known precisely, the measurement of time-of-flight can be used to infer the speed of sound, averaged over the acoustic path. [...] Changes in the speed of sound are primarily caused by changes in the temperature of the ocean, hence the measurement of the travel times is equivalent to a measurement of temperature. [...] A 1°C change in temperature corresponds to about 4m/s change in sound speed. [...] An oceanographic experiment employing tomography typically uses several source-receiver pairs in a moored array that measures an area of ocean.|$|E

40|$|Active {{control of}} sound {{radiation}} from a rectangular panel by two different methods has been experimentally studied and compared. In {{the first method}} a single control force applied directly to the structure is used with a single error microphone located in the radiated acoustic field. Global attenuation of radiated sound was observed to occur by two main mechanisms. For 'on-resonance' excitation, the control force {{had the effect of}} increasing the total panel input impedance presented to the nosie source, thus reducing all radiated sound. For 'off-resonance' excitation, the control force tends not significantly to modify the panel total response amplitude but rather to restructure the relative phases of the modes leading to a more complex vibration pattern and a decrease in radiation efficiency. For acoustic control, the second method, the number of <b>acoustic</b> <b>sources</b> required for global reduction was seen to increase with panel modal order. The mechanism in this case was that the <b>acoustic</b> <b>sources</b> tended to create an inverse pressure distribution at the panel surface and thus 'unload' the panel by reducing the panel radiation impedance.
