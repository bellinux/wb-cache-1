5|$|The main {{factor in}} the {{continued}} decline of the Javan rhinoceros population has been poaching for horns, a problem that affects all rhino species. The horns have been a traded commodity for more than 2,000 years in China, where they {{are believed to have}} healing properties. Historically, the rhinoceros' hide was used to make armor for Chinese soldiers, and some local tribes in Vietnam believed the hide could be used to make an antidote for snake venom. Because the rhinoceros' range encompasses many areas of poverty, it has been difficult to convince local people not to kill a seemingly (otherwise) useless animal which could be sold for a large sum of money. When the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora first went into effect in 1975, the Javan rhinoceros was placed under complete Appendix 1 protection; all international trade in the Javan rhinoceros and products derived from it is illegal. Surveys of the rhinoceros horn black market have determined that <b>Asian</b> <b>rhinoceros</b> horn fetches a price as high as $30,000 per kg, three times the value of African rhinoceros horn.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the most}} {{widespread}} of <b>Asian</b> <b>rhinoceroses,</b> the Javan rhinoceros ranged from the islands of Java and Sumatra, throughout Southeast Asia, and into India and China. The species is critically endangered, with only one known population in the wild, and no individuals in captivity. It is possibly the rarest large mammal on Earth, {{with a population of}} as few as 58 to 61 in Ujung Kulon National Park at the western tip of Java in Indonesia. A second population in Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam was confirmed as extinct in 2011. The decline of the Javan rhinoceros is attributed to poaching, primarily for their horns, which are highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine, fetching as much as US$30,000 per kg on the black market. As European presence in their range increased, trophy hunting also became a serious threat. Loss of habitat, especially as the result of wars, such as the Vietnam War, in Southeast Asia, has also contributed to the species' decline and hindered recovery. The remaining range is within one nationally protected area, but the rhinos are still at risk from poachers, disease, and loss of genetic diversity leading to inbreeding depression.|$|R

50|$|Perissodactyls {{are said}} to have evolved from the Phenacodontidae, small, sheep-sized animals that already shown signs of {{anatomical}} features that their descendents will inherit (the reduction of digit I and V for example). By the start of the Eocene, 55 million years ago (Mya), they had diversified and spread out to occupy several continents. Horses and tapirs both evolved in North America; rhinoceroses appear to have developed in Asia from tapir-like animals and then colonised the Americas during the middle Eocene (about 45 Mya). Of the approximately 15 families, only three survive (McKenna and Bell, 1997; Hooker, 2005). These families were very diverse in form and size; they included the enormous brontotheres and the bizarre chalicotheres.

The open grasslands were in many ways similar to the landscape of modern Africa. Gazelle, buffalo, rhinos, elephants, lions, and hippo roamed the grasslands as they do in Africa today. Large herds of Indian elephants, gazelles, antelopes and horses lived alongside several species of wild cattle including the now-extinct aurochs.

[...] However, a few examples of sculptures showing one-horned rhinoceroses are also known, for example on a bronze cylinder supported by three rhinoceroses from the tomb of King Cuo of Zhongshan (late 4th century BC). [...] Some historians have taken this as evidence that, in addition to the Sumatran Rhinoceros and Northern Sumatran rhinoceros which were more widely distributed within China, the one-horned Javan Rhinoceros was also present in ancient China.

5000|$|In {{the first}} act of the play, the {{characters}} spent much time debating whatever the rhinoceros that have mysteriously appeared in France are African or <b>Asian</b> <b>rhinoceros</b> and {{which of the two}} types were superior to the other, a debate that Ionesco meant to be a satire on racism. Regardless of whatever the rhinoceros are African or Asian, the French characters comfortably assume their superiority to the rhinoceros; ironically the same people all become rhinoceros. Bérenger's friend Jean judges the superiority of African vs. <b>Asian</b> <b>rhinoceros</b> by their number of horns (making him a caricature of those people who judge other people by the color of their skin) and at one point shouts at Bérenger: [...] "If anybody got horns, it is you! You are an Asiatic Mongol!". A recurring theme in Nazi propaganda were that the Jews were an [...] "Asiatic" [...] people who were unfortunately living in Europe who had horns, a message that many of the French become familiar with during the German occupation of 1940-44, which Ionesco alluded to by the way in Jean taunts Bérenger over his supposed horns and being [...] "Asiatic". Ionesco intended the character of Jean, an ambitious functionary whose careerism robs him of the ability to think critically to be satiric portrayal of the French civil servants who served Vichy. At various points in the play, Jean shouts out such lines as [...] "We need to go beyond moral standards!", [...] "Nature has its own laws. Morality against Nature!" [...] and [...] "We must go back to primeval integrity!". When Jean says [...] "humanism is all washed up", Bérenger asks: [...] "Are you suggesting we replace our moral laws with the law of the jungle?". Lines such as these show that Ionesco also created the character of Jean as a satire of the Iron Guard which all attacked all the humanist values of the modern West as [...] "Jewish inventions" [...] designed to destroy Romania and claimed there was a [...] "natural law" [...] in which [...] "true" [...] Romanians would discover their [...] "primal energy" [...] as the most purest section of the [...] "Latin race" [...] and assert their superiority over the [...] "lower races". Notably, the more Jean rants about [...] "natural laws" [...] trumping all, the more he transforms into a rhinoceros. When Romanian nationalism first emerged in the late 18th century-at a time when the Romanians in Bukovina and Transylvania were ruled by the Austrian Empire while the Romanians in Moldavia, Wallachia and the Dobruja were ruled by the Ottoman Empire-there was an intense emphasis on the Latinity of the Romanians, who were depicted as a lonely island of Latin civilization in Eastern Europe surrounded by [...] "Slavic and Turanian barbarians". The reference to [...] "Turanian barbarians" [...] was to both the Turks and the Magyars who both [...] "Turanian" [...] peoples from Asia. This tradition of seeing Romania as a bastion of Latinism threatened by enemies everywhere culminated in the 1930s where the Iron Guard argued there were [...] "natural laws" [...] that determined Romania's struggle for existence, which allowed the Legion to justify any act of violence no matter how amoral as necessary because of the [...] "natural laws". Ionesco parodied the Legion's talk of [...] "natural laws" [...] and [...] "primeval values" [...] by putting dialogue that closely resembled the Legion's rhetoric into Jean as he transforms into a green rhinoceros.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the same}} time, Ionesco also {{attacked}} in Rhinoceros the French intelligentsia, {{a disproportionate number}} of whom were proud members of the French Communist Party in the 1950s. As an anti-Communist Romanian émigré living in France, Ionesco was often offended by the way in which so many French intellectuals embraced Stalinism and would either justify or deny all of the crimes of the Stalin regime under the grounds that the Soviet Union was a [...] "progressive" [...] nation leading humanity to a better future. Ionesco satirized French Communist intellectuals with the character of Botard, who is easily the most left-wing character in the play. Botard professes himself to be the champion of progressive values, saying about the debate in regards to the debate over the superiority of African vs. <b>Asian</b> <b>rhinoceros</b> that: [...] "The color bar is something I feel strongly about, I hate it!". But at the same time, Botard shows himself to be rigid, small-minded and petty in his thinking, using Marxist slogans in place of intelligent thought. Most notably, Botard is unable to accept the fact of Rhinoceritis despite overwhelming evidence of its existence. For an example, Botard dismisses Rhinoceritis as: [...] "An example of collective psychosis, Mr. Dudard. Just like religion-the opiate of the people!". Despite seeing the rhinoceroses with his own eyes, Botard convinces himself that Rhinoceritis is all a gigantic capitalist plot, dismissing Rhinoceritis as an [...] "infamous plot" [...] and [...] "propaganda". Ionesco created the character of Botard as a caricature of French Communist intellectuals who managed to ignore overwhelming evidence of Stalin's terror and proclaimed the Soviet Union to be the [...] "Worker's Paradise, dismissing any evidence to the contrary as mere anti-Soviet propaganda. A further attack on Communism was provided by the character of the pipe-smoking intellectual Dudard. Ionesco stated in an interview that: [...] "Dudard is Sartre". Ionesco disliked Jean-Paul Sartre-France's most famous intellectual in the 1950s-for the way in which he sought to justify Stalin's murderous violence as necessary for the betterment of humanity as a betrayal of everything that a French intellectual should be, and intended the character of Dudard who always finds excuses for the rhinoceros as a caricature of Sartre who always found excuses for Stalin.|$|E

The aim of present study was to investigate digestive coefficients with special regard to fiber fractions. Four captive bred Galapagos giant tortoises 4 - 5 years of age were fed a controlled diet for 32 days. The diet consisted of 77 % hay, 15 % tortoise pellets, and 8 % apples on a dry matter basis. On a dry matter basis diet analysis showed: 95. 7 % organic matter, 11. 3 % crude protein, 20. 5 % crude fiber, 22. 6 % acid detergent fiber, 5. 0 % acid detergent lignin, and 17. 6 % cellulose. Based on total fecal collection during 7 days average dry matter digestibilities were calculated: 65 % for dry matter, 67 % for organic matter, 63 % for crude protein, 55 % for crude fiber, 49 % for acid detergent fiber, 41 % for acid detergent lignin, 54 % for cellulose. An increase in crude fiber content resulted in a reduced digestibility in comparative evaluations of data for different tortoise species, and in a comparison of tortoises and mammalian hindgut fermenters. Compared to some mammalian hindgut-fermenting herbivore species (domestic horses, <b>Asian</b> elephants, Indian <b>rhinoceroses)</b> on a diet of hay and concentrates, the juvenile Galapagos giant tortoises showed a digestion of similar efficiency.
