5|$|Released in , {{four years}} after the launch of the {{original}} PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 2 Slimline was the first major redesign of the PlayStation 2. Compared to its predecessor, the Slimline was smaller, thinner, quieter and also included a built-in Ethernet port (in some markets it also has an integrated modem). In , Sony began shipping a revision of the Slimline which was lighter than the original Slimline together with a lighter <b>AC</b> <b>adapter.</b> In , Sony released yet another revision of the Slimline which had an overhauled internal design incorporating the power supply into the console itself like the original PlayStation 2 resulting in a further reduced total weight of the console.|$|E

5000|$|Four-way X {{connectors}} or six-way star connectors, {{also known}} as spider connectors, with multiple plug sizes and types are common on generic power supplies. Other replacement power supplies have arrangements for changing the power connector, with four to nine different alternatives available when purchased in a set. RadioShack sells universal <b>AC</b> <b>adapters</b> of various capacities, branded as [...] "Enercell Adaptaplug", and fitted with two-pin female sockets compatible with their Adaptaplug connector lineup. This allows many different configurations of <b>AC</b> <b>adapters</b> to be put together, without requiring soldering.

25|$|All {{systems in}} the Nintendo 3DS family use the same <b>AC</b> <b>adapter</b> used with the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo DSi XL. In order to reduce {{production}} costs, certain console bundles, such as Japanese and European releases of the Nintendo 3DS XL and the New Nintendo 3DS, are not bundled with an <b>AC</b> <b>adapter,</b> requiring players to either use one from an older system they may own or purchase one separately. Along with plugging the adapter directly into the system, the standard Nintendo 3DS comes with a charging cradle, which players place their system into to charge. Charging cradles for the Nintendo 3DS XL and New Nintendo 3DS systems are sold separately from their respective systems, {{and there is no}} cradle for the Nintendo 2DS.|$|E
25|$|The PSP {{is sold in}} {{four main}} {{configurations}} that differ in which accessories are included. The basic unit package or Base Pack (called the Core Pack in North America) contains the console, a battery, and an <b>AC</b> <b>adapter.</b> This version was available at launch in Japan and was later released in North America and Europe. The Core Pack currently retails for CA$/US$169.99, ¥19,800, HK$1,280 or $1,360 (depending on the color), S$280, A$279.95, NZ$299.95, €169.99, and £129.99.|$|E

25|$|Because the Kinect sensor's {{motorized}} {{tilt mechanism}} requires {{more power than}} the Xbox 360's USB ports can supply, the device makes use of a proprietary connector combining USB communication with additional power. Redesigned Xbox 360 S models include a special AUX port for accommodating the connector, while older models require a special power supply cable (included with the sensor) that splits the connection into separate USB and power connections; power is supplied from the mains by way of an <b>AC</b> <b>adapter.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Nintendo 2DS was {{released}} in North America, Europe and Australia on October 12, 2013, {{the same day as}} Pokémon X and Y. In North America, it was available at launch in black models with red or blue bezels, while in Europe and Australia, it was available in white with red bezels, or black with blue bezels.. Each console is bundled with a 4GB SD card and an <b>AC</b> <b>adapter.</b> Matching red and blue carrying case accessories were also released on launch. With the release of the 2DS, Nintendo of America began to phase out the original 3DS, leaving the 2DS and 3DS XL as the only models still actively sold in North America as of its release.|$|E

500|$|The Nintendo DSi's {{design is}} similar to that of the second DS iteration, the Nintendo DS Lite. It is {{approximately}} 12 percent shorter (...) than the Nintendo DS Lite when closed, but slightly wider and lighter. The DSi has two [...] TFT-LCD screens— larger than those of previous models—that are capable of displaying 262,144 colors. The touch sensitive lower screen accepts input from the included stylus. The handheld features four lettered buttons (X, Y, A, B), a directional pad, and Start, Select, and Power buttons. Two shoulder buttons, a game card slot, and a power cable input are placed under the console's hinge. The included <b>AC</b> <b>adapter</b> (WAP-002) is not compatible with any other DS model.|$|E
500|$|The SG-1000 {{is powered}} by an 8-bit Zilog Z80 central {{processing}} unit running at 3.58 MHz for the SG-1000 and SG-1000 II, and at 4MHz for the SC-3000. [...] Its video processor is a Texas Instruments TMS9928A, capable of displaying up to 16 colors, and its sound processor is a Texas Instruments SN76489. [...] All three chips were also used in the ColecoVision. [...] The system includes 8 kbit (1 kB) of random access memory (RAM) and 16 kbit (2 kB) of video RAM. [...] The controller is hardwired to the system in the original model, and detachable in the SG-1000 II. [...] Video and audio output are supplied through an RF switch. [...] Power is supplied through a 9V DC connector connected to an <b>AC</b> <b>adapter.</b>|$|E
500|$|Similar to the Genesis and the Mega Jet, the Nomad's main CPU is a Motorola 68000. Possessing similar memory, graphics, {{and sound}} capabilities, the Nomad is nearly {{identical}} to the full-size console; the only variation {{is that it is}} completely self-sufficient. The Nomad has a 3.25 inch backlit color screen and an A/V output that allows the Nomad to be played on a television screen. Design elements of the handheld were made similar to the Game Gear, but included six buttons for full compatibility with later Genesis releases. Also included were a red power switch, headphone jack, volume dial, and separate controller input for multiplayer games. The controller port functions as player 2, so single-player games cannot be played with a Genesis controller. The Nomad could be powered by an <b>AC</b> <b>adapter,</b> a battery recharger known as the Genesis Nomad PowerBack, or six AA batteries, which provide a battery life of two to three hours. The Nomad consumed more power (DC 9V, 3.5W) than Sega's earlier portable gaming console, the Game Gear (DC 9V, 3W). The Nomad also lacks a [...] "Reset" [...] button, which makes it impossible to complete certain games, such as the X-Men video game, which require pressing the button to finish certain objectives.|$|E
50|$|Some SFF {{computers}} even include compact components {{designed for}} mobile computers, such as notebook optical drives, notebook memory modules, notebook processors, and external <b>AC</b> <b>adapters,</b> {{rather than the}} internal power supply units found in full-size desktop computers.|$|R

2500|$|The NES Test Station's front {{features}} a Game Pak slot and connectors for testing various components (<b>AC</b> <b>adapter,</b> RF switch, Audio/Video cable, NES Control Deck, accessories and games), with a centrally-located selector knob {{to choose which}} component to test. The unit itself weighs approximately 11.7 pounds without a TV. It connects to a television via a combined A/V and RF Switch cable. By actuating the green button, a user can toggle between an A/V Cable or RF Switch connection. The television it is connected to (typically 11" [...] to 14") {{is meant to be}} placed atop it.|$|E
2500|$|The PSP {{includes}} an 1800mAh battery (1200mAh on the 2000 and 3000 models) {{that will provide}} about 4–6hours of gameplay, 4–5hours of video playback, or 8–11hours of audio playback. Official accessories for the console include an <b>AC</b> <b>adapter,</b> car adapter, headset, headphones with remote control, extended-life 2200mAh battery, battery charger, carrying case, accessories pouch and cleaning cloth, and system pouch and wrist strap. [...] The PSP {{is equipped with a}} two-pin docking connector immediately below the AC adaptor jack for easy drop-in charging using a docking station that was to be sold separately for the PSP-1000 series. However no such charging dock was ever released by Sony. The two-pin docking station charging contacts were removed from the PSP-2000 and later versions.|$|E
50|$|Cord sets must be {{distinguished}} from <b>AC</b> <b>adapters,</b> where the connector also contains a transformer, and possibly rectifiers, filters and regulators. Unwary substitution of a standard mains-voltage connector for the power supply would result in application of full line voltage to the connected device, resulting in its destruction and possible fire or personal injury.|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{domestic}} AC power plugs and sockets, DC connectors {{have many more}} standard types that are not interchangeable. The dimensions and arrangement of DC connectors can be chosen to prevent accidental interconnection of incompatible sources and loads. Types vary from small coaxial connectors used to power portable electronic devices from <b>AC</b> <b>adapters,</b> to connectors used for automotive accessories and for battery packs in portable equipment.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Adapters</b> with <b>AC</b> outputs may consist only of {{a passive}} {{transformer}} (plus a few diodes in DC-output adapters), {{or they may}} employ switch-mode circuitry. <b>AC</b> <b>adapters</b> consume power (and produce electric and magnetic fields) even when not connected to a load; for this reason they are sometimes known as [...] "electricity vampires", and may be plugged into power strips {{to allow them to}} be conveniently turned on and off.|$|R
