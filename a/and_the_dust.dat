5|$|The Great Depression <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dust</b> Bowl dealt {{a double}} {{blow to the}} state's economy, which had {{significantly}} improved since the Civil War. Migrants abandoned the worst hit sections of Texas during the Dust Bowl years. Especially from this period on, blacks left Texas in the Great Migration to get work in the Northern United States or California and to escape the oppression of segregation. In 1940, Texas was 74 percent Anglo, 14.4 percent black, and 11.5 percent Hispanic.|$|E
5|$|Empire City {{is built}} on three islands, and the player must work through main story {{missions}} on each island before being able to access the next one, though future missions may require the player to return to an earlier island. Each island is divided {{into a number of}} sectors, {{at the start of the}} game controlled by three different gangs, the Neon District being controlled by Sasha and her Reaper Gang, the Warren District being controlled by Alden <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dust</b> Men Gang, and the Historic District being controlled by Kessler and the First Sons. The player can undertake a side mission in each sector, once certain main story requirements have been met, to free that sector from gang control, reducing or eliminating the presence of the gang in that sector. Other side missions may also unlock medical stations where Cole will re-awaken should he die. Though Cole must travel on foot he eventually gains powers that allow him to grind along power cables and powered, elevated train rails and to hover for a short time. Scattered around the city are hundreds of 'Blast Shards' which Cole can collect to increase the amount of electricity he can store. There are 32 'Dead Drop' satellite transmitters that help to reveal more of the back-story in the game, all being narrated by John White, or being recordings of Kessler and his experiments.|$|E
25|$|The economy, {{which had}} {{experienced}} significant recovery since the Civil War, was dealt a double blow by the Great Depression <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dust</b> Bowl. After the Stock Market Crash of 1929, the economy suffered significant reversals. Thousands of city workers became unemployed, {{many of whom}} depended on federal relief programs such as FERA, WPA and CCC. Thousands of unemployed Mexican citizens received one-way bus tickets to their home villages in Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Harshly {{affected}} {{by both the}} global economic downturn <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dust</b> Bowl, Canadian industrial production had fallen to only 58% of the 1929 level by 1932, the second lowest level in the world after the United States, and well behind nations such as Britain, which fell to only 83% of the 1929 level. Total national income fell to 56% of the 1929 level, again worse than any nation apart from the United States. Unemployment reached 27% at {{the depth of the}} Depression in 1933.|$|E
25|$|Colorado {{became the}} first western state to host a major {{political}} convention when the Democratic Party met in Denver in 1908. By the U.S. Census in 1930, the population of Colorado first exceeded one million residents. Colorado suffered greatly through the Great Depression <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dust</b> Bowl of the 1930s, but a major wave of immigration following World War II boosted Colorado's fortune. Tourism became a mainstay of the state economy, and high technology became an important economic engine. The United States Census Bureau estimated that the population of Colorado exceeded five million in 2009.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1930s, CAC's community-wide {{activities}} were {{greatly influenced by}} the Great Depression <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dust</b> Bowl. The Extension Service organized relief programs for inhabitants of Eastern Colorado, of whom a survey found 20,000 to be urgently in need of food, and helped sustain cropland threatened by pests and drought. President Lory sought to help Colorado farmers by pushing for major tax reforms to relieve them of high tax burdens, and {{played a significant role}} in a 1930s project that supplied irrigation water for agricultural development in Eastern Colorado.|$|E

25|$|The Egyptians {{took time}} to regroup for a final assault on the villages inner defenses, {{bringing}} reinforcements. During this reprieve, the defenders repaired the mortars and PIAT that were damaged by the flood <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dust,</b> and {{made a series of}} raids on Egypt-held structures. At 14:00, the Egyptians counterattacked but were met with heavy fire and took many casualties. This prompted the Israelis to move their only working communications device to a safer location, but it broke down, and contact with the brigade HQ was only restored at 16:00. At 17:00, the villagers again reported that their situation was critical, and that an attempted counterattack failed. The Negev Brigade intelligence officer, David Niv, intercepted an Egyptian radio message where the commander of the assault claimed to have already taken the village.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{opened with}} a cavalry charge by both armies. The Spartan cavalry were quickly {{defeated}} by the superior Theban cavalry and were chased back to their own side. Their disorderly retreat disrupted the battle lines of the Spartan heavy infantry and, because of the resulting chaos <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> stirred up, the Spartans were unable to observe the highly unusual advance of the Theban army until the very last moment. Epaminondas had ordered his troops to advance diagonally, such that the left wing of the Theban army (with its concentration of forces) would impact with {{the right wing of}} the Spartan army well before the other weaker phalanxes. The furthest right wing of the Theban phalanx was even retreating to make this possible. This is the first recorded instance of the military formation later known as the oblique order. The Theban cavalry also helped by continuing to carry out intermittent attacks along the Spartan battle lines, holding their advance back.|$|E
25|$|Little-used {{floppy disk}} drives sitting unused {{for years in}} {{computers}} can actually damage disks, due to computer case air cooling that sucks air through the drive openings. This pulls dust into the mechanism, which coats all surfaces including the exposed read/write head. Upon loading a disk on the rare occasion the drive is needed, the dust is stirred up when the disk is inserted into the mechanism, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> on the head is ground into the medium while the stirred-up dust is deposited onto the disk through the open shutters, leading to nearly instant fouling of the media. The dust also gets into the drive mechanism lubricant, {{turning it into a}} sticky slime, which may jam the mechanism and prevent head movement. This causes the computer user to see read errors on every disk they try to use, and it may also lead to data corruption through writing in incorrect locations. Some users incorrectly assume that this means all their disks have gone bad, when it is in fact the drive that is the problem. The solution is for a technician to clean the drive before it is used after a long idle period.|$|E

During the dust bowl, {{inappropriate}} farming techniques enhanced by years of drought conditions led to dust storms in Southern Minnesota and {{the other parts of}} the Midwest. Drought conditions also have helped spawn forest fires. [...] In 1894 the Great Hinckley Fire destroyed Hinckley killing an estimated 459 people, and in 1918 a forest fire killed 453 people in the vicinity of Cloquet. More recently, in 2006, the Cavity Lake Fire burned 31,830 acres (129km²) in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.|$|E
500|$|In {{the decade}} {{following}} the bombing, there was criticism of Oklahoma public schools for not requiring the bombing {{to be covered}} in the curriculum of mandatory Oklahoma history classes. Oklahoma History is a one-semester course required by state law for graduation from high school; however, the bombing was only covered for one to two pages at most in textbooks. The state's PASS standards (Priority Academic Student Skills) did not require that a student learn about the bombing, and focused more on other subjects such as corruption <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dust</b> Bowl. On April 6, 2010, [...] "House Bill 2750" [...] was signed by Governor Brad Henry, requiring the bombing to be entered into the school curriculum for Oklahoma, U.S. and world history classes.|$|E

500|$|Observations from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope {{suggest that}} Epsilon Eridani {{actually}} has two asteroid belts and {{a cloud of}} exozodiacal dust. The latter is an analogue of the zodiacal dust that occupies {{the plane of the}} Solar System. One belt sits at approximately the same position as the one in the Solar System, orbiting at a distance of [...] from Epsilon Eridani, and consists of silicate grains with a diameter of 3μm and a combined mass of about 1018kg. If the planet Epsilon Eridani b exists then this belt is unlikely to have had a source outside the orbit of the planet, so the dust may have been created by fragmentation and cratering of larger bodies such as asteroids. The second, denser belt, most likely also populated by asteroids, lies between the first belt and the outer comet disk. The structure of the belts <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dust</b> disk suggests that more than two planets in the Epsilon Eridani system are needed to maintain this configuration.|$|E
