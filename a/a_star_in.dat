5|$|A {{black hole}} {{could be the}} power source instead of <b>a</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> order to {{increase}} the matter-to conversion efficiency. A black hole would also be smaller than a star.

5|$|As {{with the}} 2000 champions, {{who had also}} come off a disappointing loss the year before, UConn {{returned}} hungrier than ever in 2001–02. With the TASS force in their senior season and Taurasi emerging as <b>a</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> her sophomore year, UConn rolled through its opponents throughout the year. The only close game the Huskies played all year long was a win at Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 b {{was later}} {{observed}} {{by a different}} team of astronomers investigating the role of metallicity, or the amount of metal present in <b>a</b> <b>star,</b> <b>in</b> the formation of planets. Six radial velocity measurements of the host star, collected using the HARPS instrument at Chile's La Silla Observatory. The team used the radial velocity data to refine the parameters of HD 154672 b from what was published in its discovery paper a year earlier.|$|E

5|$|Sakurai's Object (V4334 Sgr) is <b>a</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> the {{constellation}} of Sagittarius. It {{is thought to have}} previously been a white dwarf that, {{as a result of a}} very late thermal pulse, swelled and became a red giant. It is located at the center of a planetary nebula and is believed to currently be in thermal instability and within its final shell helium flash phase.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{stars in}} Perseus {{have been found}} to have {{planetary}} systems. V718 Persei is <b>a</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> the young open cluster IC 348 that appears to be periodically eclipsed by a giant planet every 4.7 years. This has been inferred to be an object with a maximum mass of 6 times that of Jupiter and an orbital radius of 3.3 AU.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes {{can observe}} highly {{energetic}} galactic phenomena. Ultraviolet flares are sometimes observed when <b>a</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> a distant galaxy is torn {{apart from the}} tidal forces of a nearby black hole. The distribution of hot gas in galactic clusters can be mapped by X-rays. The existence of supermassive black holes at the cores of galaxies was confirmed through X-ray astronomy.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the show}} was a bigger hit in prime time, Moore always {{preferred}} the daytime housewife audience. He thought that it gave the lonely housewives something to listen to and watch while they worked. The show provided a break into show business for many performers, including Alan King, Jonathan Winters, Carol Burnett, and Dorothy Loudon. The Garry Moore Show featured regular supporting cast members Durward Kirby, Marion Lorne, Denise Lor, and Ken Carson, {{as well as a}} mixture of song-and-dance routines and comedy skits, and introduced the public to comedian Carol Burnett. After the show ended, Burnett became <b>a</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> her own right, hosting The Carol Burnett Show for many years.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{conservation}} of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200AU and form a hot, dense protostar (<b>a</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.|$|E
5|$|Before {{entering}} politics, Kemp was {{a professional}} quarterback for 13years. He played briefly in the National Football League (NFL) and the Canadian Football League (CFL), but became <b>a</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> the American Football League (AFL). He served as captain of both the San Diego Chargers and Buffalo Bills and earned the AFL Most Valuable Player award in 1965 after leading the Bills to a second consecutive championship. He played in the AFL for all 10 years of its existence, appeared in its All-Star game seven times, played in its championship game five times, and set many of the league's career passing records. Kemp also co-founded the AFL Players Association, for which he served five terms as president. During {{the early part of}} his football career, he served in the United States Army Reserve.|$|E
50|$|He won the Grand Prix at the men's model {{audition}} of Samantha Thavasa in 2013. He later {{worked as}} <b>an</b> actor <b>an</b> <b>starred</b> <b>in</b> television dramas and films in his current stage name sine 2015.|$|R

5|$|Belushi {{had become}} <b>a</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> 1978 {{as a result}} of both the Blues Brothers' musical success and his role in National Lampoon's Animal House. At one point, he managed the triple feat of being the star of the week's top-grossing film, top-rated {{television}} show, and singing on the number-one album within a year. When Aykroyd and Belushi decided they could make a Blues Brothers film, the bidding war was intense. Universal Studios narrowly beat Paramount Pictures for the project. John Landis, who had directed Belushi in Animal House, was aboard as director.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris is <b>a</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> the {{southern}} constellation of Pictor, the Easel, and is located {{to the west}} of the bright star Canopus. It traditionally marked the sounding line of the ship Argo Navis, before the constellation was split. The star has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.861, so is visible to the naked eye under good conditions, though light pollution may result in stars dimmer than magnitude 3 being too dim to see. It is the second brightest in its constellation, exceeded only by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent magnitude of 3.30.|$|E
5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When <b>a</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
50|$|A {{companion}} {{has also}} been detected, <b>a</b> 14th magnitude <b>star</b> (<b>in</b> infrared) 8 arc seconds away. This would be a separation of nearly 1,000 AU, {{but there is a}} possibility that it is <b>an</b> unrelated <b>star</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chance alignment.|$|R

5|$|Bruce Bowen Jr. {{was born}} in Merced, California as son of Bruce Bowen Sr. and Dietra Campbell. Bowen had a {{problematic}} childhood growing up in Merced, because, he claims, his mother took drugs and even sold the family TV to feed her habit. Bruce Jr. spent his days playing basketball and eventually became <b>a</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> the local West Fresno Edison High School squad. He then played four seasons at Cal State Fullerton, appearing in 101 games, and averaged 11.4 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. After averaging 16.3 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 36.6 minutes in 27 games as a senior in 1992–93, he {{was named to the}} All-Big West Conference First Team. Bowen ranks 12th on the Titans' all-time list in career points (1,155) and is seventh all-time in rebounds (559).|$|E
5|$|French {{astronomer}} Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and designated ten {{stars with}} the Bayer designations Alpha through to Iota in 1756. <b>A</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> neighbouring Indus that Lacaille had labelled Nu Indi {{turned out to}} be in Microscopium, so Gould renamed it Nu Microscopii. Francis Baily considered Gamma and Epsilon Microscopii to belong to the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus, but subsequent cartographers did not follow this. In his 1725 Catalogus Britannicus, John Flamsteed labelled the stars 1, 2, 3 and 4 Piscis Austrini, which became Gamma Microscopii, HR 8076, HR 8110 and Epsilon Microscopii respectively. Within the constellation's borders, there are 43 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E

It has also been awarded the Restaurant of the Year title by Tatler in 2011, and won the BMW Square Meal Award for Best New Restaurant. The Zagat guide awarded {{the restaurant}} the title of Best Newcomer in 2011. In 2012 at number 9 it was the highest new entry in The World's 50 Best Restaurants list by UK-based Restaurant Magazine, also {{the highest in the}} UK. The restaurant received a second Michelin Star in the 2014 Michelin guide, becoming Blumenthal's sixth star.|$|E
