As a fatal defect is detected, it is common to shut down the machinery as soon as possible to avoid catastrophic damages. Performing such an action, which usually occurs at inconvenient times, typically results in substantial time and economical losses. It is, therefore, important to monitor the condition of <b>antifriction</b> <b>bearings</b> and to know the details of severity of defects before they cause serious catastrophic consequences. The vibration monitoring technique is suitable to analyze various defects in bearing. This technique can provide early information about progressing malfunctions.

Test greases were selected to cover a wide spectrum of thickener and base oil types, and base oil viscosities. The trends in measured friction coefficients were analysed in relation to grease composition in an attempt to establish the relative influence of individual grease components on friction. Two distinct operating regions with markedly different friction behaviour are identified for each grease. At relatively high speeds the greases behave approximately as their bled/base oils, while in the low speed region the frictional response is very dependent on their thickener type and properties of the lubricating film. Low viscosity, synthetic base oil seems to offer efficiency advantages in the high speed region regardless of thickener used, while the choice of thickener type is significant under low speed conditions...|$|R

When properly consolidated, this uniform structure is preserved while generating a fully dense product.

40|$|Squeeze film dampers are novel rotor dynamic devices used to {{alleviate}} small amplitude, large force vibrations {{and are used}} in conjunction with <b>antifriction</b> <b>bearings</b> in aircraft jet engine bearings to provide external damping as these possess very little inherent damping.

The paper investigates the effect of temperature and electric field on the apparent viscosity and dynamic (stiffness and damping characteristics) of ER fluid (suspension of diatomite in transformer oil) using the available literature. These characteristics increase with the field as the viscosity increases with the field. However, these characteristics decrease with increase in temperature and shear strain rate as the viscosity of the fluid decreases with temperature and shear strain rate.

40|$|Rolling {{bearings}} {{are among}} the most widely used machine elements. As a result, reducing bearing frictional losses can {{have a significant impact on}} the overall energy efficiency of the vast majority of engineering systems. Given that rolling bearings are typically lubricated with grease, one of the most effective ways to improve bearing efficiency is through a suitable grease formulation. However, at present there is a lack of understanding of grease frictional behaviour in typical non-conformal, highly stressed bearing contacts. This limits the development of low-friction <b>bearing</b> <b>greases,</b> and thus further improvements in bearing efficiency. The current research work attempts to address this topic through an experimental investigation. Friction and film thickness tests were conducted on a wide selection of greases in ball-on-disc tribometers, under conditions broadly representative of rolling bearing contacts. Initial work was carried out with a series of commercially available greases, selected to cover a wide spectrum of thickener types, base oil types and viscosities, and practical bearing applications. These tests served to identify the most influential aspects of grease formulation on friction, and provide a reference line in terms of the current state of the art in low-friction <b>bearing</b> <b>greases.</b> Subsequently, the work was focussed on the study of a series of custom lithium-thickened greases. These were designed and manufactured with the purpose of isolating and investigating the effects of particular aspects of interest in grease formulation, including base oil type, base oil viscosity and the presence of friction modifiers. In addition, the performance of the corresponding bled and base oils was also studied to help shed some light on the prevailing mechanisms. The results show that two distinct operating regions, at high and low speeds, can be identified in the tribological performance of greases. At high speed greases behave approximately as their base oils. In this region, oil type was found to be the major parameter of influence on friction, with synthetic oils (particularly PAO) providing the lowest friction coefficients. In the same high speed region, the influence of base oil viscosity is that expected from a classical Stribeck relationship for oils, i. e. higher base oil viscosities in the grease formulation tend to produce higher friction as a result of thicker films. In contrast, at low speed grease behaviour is much more complex and is strongly influenced by both base oil and thickener properties. In this region the combination of lithium and PAO was shown to provide both thick films and low friction. No benefit in friction reduction was observed when a friction modifier, namely oleic acid, was added to the formulation of the greases. The influence of mechanical degradation of greases on their tribological performance was also evaluated. It was established that mechanical degradation has the effect of diminishing the friction and film thickness benefits provided by some of the greases at low speeds. A remarkable exception was found in the tribological behaviour of greases formulated with lithium and PAO oil, which was overall practically unaffected by mechanical degradation. Finally, based on the observed results, the combination of a low viscosity PAO base oil and lithium thickener was suggested as the most suitable formulation for a low-friction rolling <b>bearing</b> <b>grease.</b> Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of the yield stress and start-up torque for six commonly used rolling <b>bearing</b> <b>greases</b> is presented. Both parameters were found to depend exponentially on temperature where the exponent changes below a low-temperature “break point. ” This break point {{was found to be}} related to the pourpoint of the base oil, although the start-up torques of the greases were an order higher in magnitude than that of their corresponding bled oils. The start-up torque is mostly used to measure the low-temperature limit of a grease. It was found here that this temperature is much lower than the break point. The start-up torque criterion is measured using a particular bearing type and conditions. The low-temperature break point for the yield stress is a more universal grease parameter that gives useful information about the behavior of a grease at low temperatures and can be used as one of the guidelines for grease selection for low-temperature application...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Basically, rolling <b>bearings</b> <b>greases</b> are {{consisting}} of two main components: a lubricating liquid, generally oil, and a thickening agent. The most used lubricants of this type in rolling contacts lubrication are mineral oil and Lithium soaps based, their properties being improved by adding the appropriate additives for specific technical applications. Here it can be highlighted their particular constitutive aspect given by the soap three-dimensional network ({{consisting of}} twisted or flatted fibres) that contains the base oil. Both fibres elementary dimensions and the soap structural uniformity are different from a manufacturer to other being influenced by the processing technology, by the raw materials provenience or by the thickener quantity or the presence of additives. Lubricating greases behaviour is dependant on their initial structure and also by their rheology under the external loads influence, all this aspects having a strong influence on greases service life.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the work}} is to develop a method for {{measuring}} the radial clearance of mounted <b>antifriction</b> <b>bearings</b> in an automatically and standardized way. The measurement of the radial clearance should take place on bearings mounted on a shaft before and after assembling. Based on this method a measurement setup was constructed which enables to measure the radial clearance of different types of bearings with different dimensions. First tests were done with roller bearings as well as ball bearings with different dimensions. Results of those tests show, that the developed system provides as good or better results than the manual test method for measuring the radial clearance of a bearing by hand. The measuring process itself runs automatically. The results are reliable, independent form the user and reproducible. Furthermore the whole assembling of the bearings on a shaft should be automated without to interrupt the process of mounting in order to measure the radial clearance. Based on the results of the measurements, the process of assembling could be readjusted. By using this closed loop method, it will be achieved that bearings will be mounted on a shaft with the specified radial clearance which is defined by the technical designer. A further part of this work is the automated documentation of the parameters which are connected with the process of assembling. During the assembling all important parameters will be measured automatically. In parallel they will be written to a database. Afterwards a protocol will be generated automatically, which could also be used as dimensional data sheet for each individual assembled bearing. A perfect traceability is than possible...|$|R
