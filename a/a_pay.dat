5|$|For the negotiations, {{the studio}} {{requested}} that the cast members accept a 45 percent cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the series' last. The actors {{were willing to take}} <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> cut, but wanted a percentage of the back-end payments instead. At one point Shearer even offered a 70 percent pay cut in exchange for back-end percentages, but the studio was unwilling to make any deal involving back-end percentages. In the end, the studio and the actors reached a deal, in which the actors would take <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> cut of 30 percent, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season. As well as the voice actors, everybody involved in the show took <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> cut. This included animators, writers, the post-production crew and even Jean himself. The further use of digital animation also saves money, as the animation of the show becomes more efficient.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Fox {{announced}} that, due {{to financial}} difficulties, {{they were unable}} to continue to produce The Simpsons under its current contract and that unless there were pay cuts, the show could end. For the negotiations, the studio requested that the cast members accept a 45% cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the last. In the end, the studio and the actors reached a deal, in which the actors would take <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> cut of 30%, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season.

5|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} the character Maude Flanders, who had previously been voiced by cast member Maggie Roswell. This kill-off was the result of Roswell leaving The Simpsons in spring 1999 after <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> dispute with the Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs the show. Since 1994, she had been flying between her Denver home and Los Angeles twice a week to record episodes of The Simpsons. She eventually grew tired of this, and the price of plane tickets was constantly increasing. As a result, she asked Fox for <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> raise from $2,000 per episode to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit.|$|E

5|$|After denying rumors for decades, in 2004 McElhenny {{confirmed}} {{that he received}} improper financial benefits from the University of Washington during his time there, which included a $300 monthly check. Per NCAA rules, the most a college can offer an athlete is a summer job and a scholarship covering boarding and tuition. A popular (albeit usually jocular) spin on the rumor was that McElhenny essentially took <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> cut {{when he left the}} university to play for the 49ers. This was not entirely untrue; all payments accounted for, including legitimate ones, McElhenny claimed he and his wife received a combined $10,000 a year while at Washington—with the 49ers, his rookie salary was worth $7,000.|$|E
5|$|As {{the reigning}} most {{valuable}} player, Richard sought <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> raise {{prior to the}} 1947–48 season. General manager Frank Selke refused, even after Richard and team captain Émile Bouchard both sat out the Canadiens' preseason before capitulating and returning to the team when the season began. The Punch line was broken up after Blake suffered a career-ending leg injury. Richard's season also ended early as he missed the final {{games of the season}} due to a knee injury. He finished second in team scoring with 53 points in 53 games, but Montreal missed the playoffs. After recording only 38 points in 1948–49, Richard posted a 65-point campaign the next season and his 43 goals led the NHL for the third time. In 1950–51, Richard scored 42 goals, including his 271st career goal, making him Montreal's all-time goal leader.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> raise, {{but was not}} as {{satisfied with}} his career advancement as he had anticipated; Rasinski had died in 1965, Bakshi did not have creative control over The Mighty Heroes, and he was unhappy {{with the quality of}} the animation, writing, timing and voice acting. Although the series' first 20 segments were successful, Bakshi wanted to leave Terrytoons to form his own company. In 1967, he drew up presentation pieces for a fantasy series called Tee-Witt, with help from Anzilotti, Johnnie Zago and Bill Foucht.|$|E

5|$|Chance {{began his}} career in 1898 with the Chicago Cubs, serving as a reserve catcher and outfielder. He played irregularly through the 1902 season. Due in part to finger {{injuries}} suffered while catching, Chance played in no more than 75 games in a season through 1902. In 1903, Johnny Kling became the Cubs' full-time catcher. As Bill Hanlon, the Cubs' first baseman, left the team, manager Frank Selee moved Chance to first base. Though Chance initially balked at the position change, he agreed when he received <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> raise.|$|E

5|$|Following Franklin's retirement, she {{and several}} other retired female faculty members filed a class action lawsuit against the University of Toronto {{claiming}} it had been unjustly enriched by paying women faculty less than comparably qualified men. In 2002, the lawsuit was settled when the university acknowledged that many of its female professors had suffered from gender barriers and pay discrimination during their careers. As a result, about 60 retired women faculty received <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> equity settlement intended to compensate them for the lower salaries and pensions they had received.|$|E
5|$|George Burley {{took over}} from Redknapp in December 2005, though neither manager {{was unable to}} put {{together}} an effective promotion campaign and Southampton ended the season 12th in the Championship. Higginbotham rejected a new contract {{and as a result}} was placed on the transfer list in July 2006. He told the local press that he felt disrespected the way Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe had handled his contract – he had taken <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> cut to move from Derby, a 40% pay cut following relegation, and then the new contract offer was lower still than his current contract.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, Kentuckians {{ratified}} {{their third}} constitution. One of many changes effected by this document {{was that the}} office of superintendent became elective. Though the election belonged to the Democrats, Breckinridge, a Whig, was elected over five challengers for the office. His tenure would be a short one, however. Unlike his early reforms, his calls for parental selection of textbooks {{and use of the}} Bible as the primary reading material were not heeded. He also opposed the abolition of tuition charges and unsuccessfully lobbied for <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> increase for his position. (The salary was only $750.) With little prospect of further reform under his leadership, Breckinridge resigned in 1853.|$|E
