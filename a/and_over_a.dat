5|$|A {{series of}} {{disturbing}} events troubled Monteverdi's {{world in the}} period around 1630. Mantua was invaded by Habsburg armies in 1630, who besieged the plague-stricken town, and after its fall in July looted its treasures, and dispersed the artistic community. The plague was carried to Mantua's ally Venice by an embassy led by Monteverdi's confidante Striggio, <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> period of 16 months led to over 45,000 deaths, leaving Venice's population in 1633 at just above 100,000, the lowest level for about 150 years. Among the plague victims was Monteverdi's assistant at San Marco, and a notable composer in his own right, Alessandro Grandi. The plague and the after-effects of war had an inevitable deleterious effect {{on the economy and}} artistic life of Venice. Monteverdi's younger brother Giulio Cesare also died at this time, probably from the plague.|$|E
5|$|After {{the storm}} {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about six}} hours, the IMD downgraded Gonu to very severe cyclonic storm status late on June 4. Its eye became cloud-filled and ragged, and the cyclone gradually weakened due to cooler water temperatures and drier air as it approached the Arabian Peninsula. Due to land interaction with Oman, the inner core of deep convection rapidly weakened, <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> period of 24hours the intensity decreased by 95km/h (60mph). According to the IMD, Cyclone Gonu crossed the easternmost tip of Oman still as a very severe cyclonic storm early on June 6. Although the winds continued to gradually decrease, overall organization increased slightly in the hours prior to landfall; Gonu maintained a well-defined low-level structure with a weak eye.|$|E

The unincorporated suburb of Cutlerville lies to the east as US131 approaches M-6, the South Beltline Freeway, and meets in the largest freeway interchange in West Michigan. Gaining a third lane in each direction, the interchange stretches over a half mile (0.8km) in width <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> mile (1.6km) in length and encompasses 27bridges and 18retaining walls. US131 continues north through the city of Wyoming to the more suburban residential areas near the southern city limits of Grand Rapids north of M-11 (28th Street).|$|E
5|$|At Caimito and Rosario, warehouses, their contents, piers, and wharves {{were all}} driven {{out into the}} {{neighboring}} ocean, and both towns were entirely flattened. The hurricane destroyed all the piers and nearly every building in Cabañas, and of the 23houses built in Cojimar, only seven weathered the storm. A majority of ships at Matanzas were destroyed, with numerous ships capsized or washed aground. Massive waves crashed ashore, crushing buildings and inundating low-lying areas in the city. Many wooden and stone buildings, already impaired by an earlier hurricane in 1844, were immediately destroyed by the surge's impact. Structures along the shoreline, in addition to towns along the courses of the Yumurí and San Juan rivers, were driven out to sea. More than forty deaths occurred {{in the first round}} of flooding brought by the storm. At Güines, the tempest wrecked all of the town's residences, public buildings, and businesses, <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> hundred individuals died. Among the losses were two distilleries, a packing plant, a lumbermill, and a warehouse, and countless other buildings, while at Pinar del Río, flooding along mountainsides and nearby rivers swamped the city and other nearby communities.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the M-76 {{designation}} was decommissioned in 1973, most of the overall highway had been converted to freeway. It started southwest of Standish at an interchange with US23 in southern Arenac County. The freeway ran northward through fields to a junction with M-61 where it turned northwesterly. M-76 passed to the southwest of Sterling <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> tributary of the Tittabawassee River as the freeway approaches Alger through a forested area. In Ogemaw County, the trunkline ran south and west of Greenwood and continued to the West Branch area. There, M-76 met the southeastern end of its business loop that ran north into downtown. The freeway bypassed the town to the southwest, passed over M-30 without an interchange and then met the northwestern end of the business loop. While M-76 was still an active highway designation, this second business loop junction {{marked the end of}} the freeway in the area. M-76 turned west, merging onto M-55 to run concurrently along a two-lane highway.|$|E

5|$|Despite Vinokourov's hopes upon {{crashing}} out of {{the race}} that the squad would continue to be combative, they did not attain any noteworthy results over the remainder of the Tour. Grivko and Fofonov took top-ten stage placings from breakaways in stages 16 and 17, but did not come close to winning either day, finishing tenth and sixth respectively <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> minute off the winner's time both days. Vaitkus finished eighth on the Champs-Élysées stage to close out the Tour.

5|$|In the 1950s, American Foreign Service officer Warren M. Robbins {{collected}} African figures, masks, books, {{and textiles}} from German antique shops. Upon returning to Washington, D.C., in 1960, he purchased {{a house on}} Capitol Hill and opened his collection for viewing. Robbins, without museum, arts, or fundraising experience, believed that the collection could advance interracial civil rights and improve national respect for {{a major component of}} black cultural heritage. Starting in 1963, he expanded his Capitol Hill house museum into adjacent townhouses, including the former house of abolitionist Frederick Douglass. The collections eventually occupied nine townhouses <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> dozen other properties near the Supreme Court Building.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the city}} walls, suburbs had sprung up {{providing}} {{homes for the}} craftsmen and tradespeople who flocked to the already overcrowded city. These were shanty towns with wooden shacks and no sanitation. The government had tried to control this development but had failed <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> {{quarter of a million}} people lived here. Other immigrants had taken over fine town houses, vacated by Royalists who had fled the country during the Commonwealth, converting them into tenements with different families in every room. These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested slums.|$|E

5|$|The 3rd-century crisis {{started a}} chain-reaction of {{socio-economic}} effects that proved decisive {{for the development}} of the late army. The combination of barbarian devastation and reduced tax-base due to plague bankrupted the imperial government, which resorted to issuing ever more debased coin e.g. the antoninianus, the silver coin used to pay the troops in this period, lost 95% of its silver content between its launch in 215 and its demise in the 260s. Thus 20 times more money could be distributed with the same amount of precious metal. This led to rampant price inflation: for example, the price of wheat under Diocletian was 67 times the typical price under the Principate. The monetary economy collapsed and the army was obliged to rely on unpaid food levies to obtain supplies. Food levies were raised without regard to fairness, ruining the border provinces where the military was mainly based. Soldiers' salaries became worthless, which reduced the army's recruits to a subsistence-level existence. This in turn discouraged volunteers and forced the government to rely on conscription and large-scale recruitment of barbarians into the regular army because of the shortfalls caused by the plague. By the mid-4th century, barbarian-born men probably accounted for about a quarter of all recruits (<b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> third in elite regiments), likely a far higher share than in the 1st and 2nd centuries.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{nonetheless}} rejoiced at {{the death}} of Domitian, and immediately following Nerva's accession as Emperor, passed damnatio memoriae on his memory: his coins and statues were melted, his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records. Domitian <b>and,</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> century later, Publius Septimius Geta were the only emperors known to have officially received a damnatio memoriae, though others may have received de facto ones. In many instances, existing portraits of Domitian, such as those found on the Cancelleria Reliefs, were simply recarved to fit the likeness of Nerva, which allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material. Yet {{the order of the}} Senate was only partially executed in Rome, and wholly disregarded in most of the provinces outside Italy.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} some comets may be fragile, a {{conclusion}} {{supported by the}} observation of comets splitting apart. A significant cometary disruption was that of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9, which was discovered in 1993. A close encounter in July 1992 had broken it into pieces, <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> period of six days in July 1994, these pieces fell into Jupiter's atmosphere—the first time astronomers had observed a collision between two objects in the Solar System. Other splitting comets include 3D/Biela in 1846 and 73P/Schwassmann–Wachmann from 1995 to 2006. Greek historian Ephorus reported that a comet split apart {{as far back as}} the winter of 372–373 BC. Comets are suspected of splitting due to thermal stress, internal gas pressure, or impact.|$|E

Shortly after their departure, France and Spain ceased hostilities, and Louis was no longer interested in sending La Salle further assistance. Details of the voyage were kept secret so that Spain would not learn about it. La Salle's naval commander, the Sieur de Beaujeu, resented La Salle's keeping their destination until the party was well underway. The discord between the two intensified {{when they reached the}} island of Santo Domingo and quarreled over where to anchor. Beaujeu sailed {{to another part of the}} island, allowing Spanish privateers to capture the St. François, which had been fully loaded with supplies, provisions, and tools for the colony.|$|E

The land that forms Dunwood Park was presented to Crompton Urban District Council by Captain Abram Crompton JP on 22 June 1911, and opened as a park by him on 14 September 1912. It was redeveloped with a new park and bowling green for its 2012 centenary after winning a £1 million grant from the National Lottery. High Crompton Park is in High Crompton and is home to a tennis court, bowling green, children's play area, and gardens. Jubilee Gardens are found in the centre of Shaw and Crompton town centre, behind the Crompton War Memorial. Shaw and Crompton has large areas of land reserved for sporting and communal events; these are located off George Street, Edward Road, and Rushcroft Road respectively.|$|E
