25|$|Rav Judah {{reported}} in Samuel's name {{an account of}} the rarity of completely Red Cows: When they asked Rabbi Eliezer how far the honor due parents extended, Rabbi Eliezer told of a non-Jew from Ashkelon named Dama son of Nethinah. The Sages offered Dama a profit of 600,000 gold denarii (or Rav Kahana said 800,000 denarii) in exchange for jewels that he had that the Sages could use in the ephod, but as the key to the jewels lay under Dama's father's pillow, Dama declined the offer so as not to trouble his father. The next year, God rewarded Dama by causing a Red Cow to be born in his herd. When the Sages went to buy it, Dama told them that he knew that he could ask for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world and they would pay it, but he asked for only the money that he had lost in honoring his father.|$|E
5000|$|The bandits {{attempted}} {{to lock the}} cashier and a female employee in the bank vault. Finding that the safe would not work, they began scooping <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> sight as well as <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> sight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> safe, consisting of paper and silver. One of the bandits cautioned bank officials against making false moves under pain of having [...] "hell shot out of them".|$|R

25|$|The next scene {{takes place}} in this back room. Drunk, Tamashima draws his sword and reveals himself as Nippon Daemon in a rousing speech, before {{demanding}} Kōbei hand over <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shop. Though Rikimaru and Kozō have made off with 100 ryō, the entire ordeal was a ruse to help Daemon earn Kōbei's trust, and to get himself into the back room. Sōnosuke throws himself between the two, offering his own life instead of that of his father-in-law; Daemon stops, noting that he once had a son who would be roughly Sōnosuke's age. The two older men begin {{to talk about their}} pasts and come to the realization that not only is Daemon Sōnosuke's true father, but Kōbei is in fact Kozō's true father. Both men, for differing reasons, lost their sons at a crowded ritual ceremony at the Hase-dera over a decade prior, and agree to forget about Daemon's criminal scheme as they thank one another for taking care of one another's sons, though Kōbei does ask that Daemon attempt to turn all five of the thieves away from their lives of crime.|$|E
500|$|Schur {{said of the}} episode's plot, [...] "They're very {{confused}} because in Venezuela the government is so powerful; their parks department travels with military escorts and motorcades and stuff. They have <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world because of their oil and they (don't understand) why Pawnee's parks department is so rinky-dink." [...] A fan of Parks and Recreation since its inception, Armisen said he laughed {{as soon as he}} read the script, and found it even funnier during the table read with the cast. After working with Armisen, Rashida Jones described him as [...] "one of the funniest people on the planet".|$|E
500|$|Cada {{started playing}} online poker {{at about the}} age of 16. He twice staked {{accounts}}, but lost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> accounts that he shared with his brother Jerome. [...] His first online account was with PartyPoker. Although he was not legally able to play in casinos prior to age 21 in the United States, he could play in Canada at age 19 and play online. [...] After a brief sabbatical from the game subsequent to losing his money, he began to play at a casino in Windsor, Ontario across the Canada–US border from his Detroit-area home. He earned enough to enter contests in the Bahamas and Costa Rica.|$|E
50|$|After getting <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> sight, {{they quickly}} left {{the bank and}} hoped into a waiting automobile, in which the sixth bandit sat, and {{departed}} north out of Upland, where it was reported they turned west.|$|R

500|$|On {{the sixth}} day of trial, alcohol tax agent Patrick Donoghue testified that, {{in a case}} that Donoghue had investigated, Glasser persuaded a grand jury to reverse itself after {{returning}} an indictment by placing the matter on the pending call indefinitely. Another government witness, bootlegging handyman Ralph Sharp testified that he had paid Kretske $250 in order for Kretske, as prosecutor, to recommend that the charges against him be dismissed (which they were). Frank Hodorowicz, another bootlegger turned government witness, testified that he had paid Kretske $1,300 to recommend the dismissal of two cases and was convicted in the third case after he refused to pay $1,000. After he was indicted the third time, he testified, Glasser declined to intervene on his behalf, saying: [...] "You're going to jail for five years; I can't do anything about it. For <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world I couldn't help you. This isn't an ordinary case. Agents are in town from Washington." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, New Line Cinema {{bought the}} rights to produce an English-language remake with Guillermo del Toro as producer. On remakes, {{director}} Bayona noted that [...] "The Americans have <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world but can't do anything, while we can do whatever we want but don't have the money" [...] and [...] "The American industry doesn't take chances, that's why they make remakes of movies that were already big hits". On August 4, 2009, Larry Fessenden was announced {{as the director of}} the American remake. Fessenden was later announced that he will not be involved with directing the remake, stating [...] "Working on the script with Guillermo was a very exciting experience, but then I got into a casting miasma and that's where the thing is; I think they're gonna do it another way, actually. So I think I'm out of it. Hopefully they'll still use my script, but I'm not sure I'm directing it anymore". In January 2010, Mark Pellington replaced Larry Fessenden as director of the project.|$|E
500|$|Two contestants {{compete on}} each episode. On each turn, a Bingo ball {{comes out of}} the hopper and a {{question}} is asked. Each ball has a number from 1 to 75 and a letter in the word [...] "BINGO" [...] printed on it. If the question is answered correctly, the player earns the letter from that ball and the number on the ball is added in dollars to the bank, which starts at $500 (e.g., if G-50 comes out, the bank increases by $50). If the letter is a duplicate already earned by the player, no extra letters are earned. The first player that spells out BINGO from the earned letters wins the game. A Free-Space Ball with a sponsor's logo acts as a wild card in the game. The player who answers a question correctly when that ball is rolled out can choose any letter, and $100 is added to the bank. Two regular games are played. Contestants who win both games win the match and receive <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bank. If each contestant wins one game, a five-question tie-breaker game is played. The first question's answer begins with a B, the second question's answer starts with I, and so on. The first to answer three questions correctly wins the money in the bank and goes on to play the Bingo Bonus Board for a chance at $100,000.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2007, Charisteas told Dutch {{football}} magazine Voetbal International {{that winning}} Euro 2004 was an unbelievable experience {{which he would}} not swap for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world: “Even in 50 years time, everybody will remember that I scored the goal which made Greece the champions of Europe.

2500|$|... "Baron Hans von Bleichröder, {{like all}} acquaintances of the House of Saxe-Weimar, had a {{farewell}} {{view of the}} departed, but he was expressly forbidden {{to take part in}} the funeral or to attend the cremation. As for the stories set in circulation in regards to a marriage between Princess Sophie and Baron von Bleichröder, there needs to be repeated the oft-spoken statement of her father, that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world would never have sufficed to bridge the gulf between a Princess of Saxe-Weimar and Baron von Bleichroeder." ...|$|E
6000|$|Merril nodded quietly, {{and nobody}} {{could have told}} that to raise the sum {{required}} would be singularly inconvenient to him. [...] "At least!" [...] he said.

2500|$|Some of Aguinaldo's {{associates}} supported America, {{even before}} hostilities began. Pedro Paterno, Aguinaldo's {{prime minister and}} the author of the 1897 armistice treaty with Spain, advocated the incorporation of the Philippines into the United States in 1898. Other associates sympathetic to the U.S. were Trinidad Pardo de Tavera and Benito Legarda, prominent members of Congress; Gregorio Araneta, Aguinaldo's Secretary of Justice; and Felipe Buencamino, Aguinaldo's Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Buencamino is recorded to have said in 1902: [...] "I am an American and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Philippines, the air, the light, and the sun I consider American." [...] Many such people subsequently held posts in the colonial government.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2017, Plummer {{was cast}} to replace Kevin Spacey in the already-completed Ridley Scott film <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> World. The move came amid {{numerous}} {{sexual harassment and}} sexual assault allegations made towards Spacey. All scenes that had included Spacey were to be re-shot with Plummer. Co-stars Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams confirmed their availability for the necessary filming. The decision was made not long before the scheduled release date of December 22 but TriStar Pictures intended to meet that release date {{in spite of the}} tight re-shooting and editing schedule. The film was pulled from a showing that was planned for [...] November 16 at the AFI Fest held by the American Film Institute in Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|For their 1978 {{follow-up}} album, Brakara, Prima Vera {{decided to}} include [...] "Arne Belinda" [...] anyway, by slightly altering the song's melody so that Erik Bye {{could no longer}} be credited as composer. This move gave Prima Vera lots of publicity ahead of the release, and with rumors of Bye going to court to have the album stopped, people flocked to the music stores to secure a copy before the album was withdrawn from the market, and to hear what the fuss was all about. As a result, Brakara sold [...] copies in Norway, went platinum, and {{reached the top of the}} album chart, where it remained in the top five for 13 weeks. The rumored lawsuit from Erik Bye never came, but in his 2004 autobiography Falsk credits the [...] "Arne Belinda" [...] debacle as the single-biggest reason Brakara topped the charts, claiming this was [...] "the kind of publicity you couldn't buy with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world", and helped make Prima Vera a national phenomenon.|$|E

50|$|The Party {{believes}} that the current monetary system is unfair and unsustainable because {{it is based on}} money as debt, i.e. <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> circulation comes as a loan with an interest rate that never went into circulation (only principal did), which is, according to the Party, the cause of many evictions in Croatia.|$|R
50|$|The {{contestant}} may {{select up}} to 10 machines, and must bank enough <b>money</b> to reach <b>the</b> target {{in order to}} win that total.

2500|$|At Christmas in 1956, Townes's {{father gave}} him a guitar, which he practiced while {{wandering}} the countryside. He would later tell an interviewer that [...] "watching Elvis Presley's October 28, 1956, performance on The Ed Sullivan Show was {{the starting point for}} me becoming a guitar player... I just thought that Elvis had <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, all the Cadillacs and all the girls, and all he did was play the guitar and sing. That made a big impression on me." [...] In 1958 the family moved to Boulder, Colorado. Van Zandt would remember his time in Colorado fondly and would often visit it as an adult. He would later refer to Colorado in [...] "My Proud Mountains", [...] "Colorado Girl", and [...] "Snowin' On Raton". Townes was a good student and active in team sports. In grade school, he received a high IQ score and his parents began grooming him to become a lawyer or senator. Fearing that his family would move again, he willingly decided to attend the Shattuck School, Faribault, Minnesota. He received a score of 1170 when he took the SAT in January 1962. His family soon moved to Houston, Texas.|$|E

50|$|The Indonesians {{had been}} advised by the British that {{an issue of}} Indonesian money would be {{financial}} and political suicide, but their resolve was firm.
