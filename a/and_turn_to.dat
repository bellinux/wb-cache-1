5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, Cyclone Bola quickly weakened as it accelerated southeastward {{toward a}} frontal trough. On March 3, its winds dropped below hurricane-force, and it gradually lost its tropical characteristics. The structure became asymmetric, {{with a large}} band of clouds extending well south of the circulation. By March 4, Bola had completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone. Which turned south and began to affect the North Island of New Zealand on March 6. A building ridge of high pressure to its south caused the extratropical remnants of Bola to slow <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the west on March 7. The next day, the storm passed about 110 km (70 mi) north of the North Island. Around the same time, the storm began slowly filling, meaning the low pressure area associated with Bola was losing its identity. It turned southward on March 9, and on March 12 was absorbed by a stationary trough in the Westerlies near the western coast of the South Island.|$|E
5|$|By October5, {{the eye of}} Nora was {{no longer}} evident on {{satellite}} imagery, which indicated {{the beginning of a}} weakening trend. However, a Special Sensor Microwave/Imager observed a small eye that was open to the northwest. The convection became ragged, and on October6 the winds decreased below hurricane-force. Around the same time, a strong approaching mid-level trough caused Nora to slow <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the east. Continued wind shear and the presence of dry air stripped the thunderstorms away from the center, and by October7 all of the deep convection had dissipated. As a result, it was downgraded to a tropical depression, and Nora weakened {{to the extent that it}} barely met the criteria for being a tropical cyclone. The NHC maintained advisories due to the circulation's proximity to western Mexico, as well as the unlikely potential for redeveloping thunderstorms due to its movement over warmer waters. Nora accelerated to the east-northeast and later to the northeast due to the advancing trough. As it approached western Mexico, an area of curved convection unexpectedly developed over the center. Without additional redevelopment, the poorly defined circulation of Nora made landfall near Mazatlán, Sinaloa early on October9. It dissipated shortly thereafter over the high terrain of western Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was moving north-northwestward, around the western periphery of a weak ridge; the first forecast advisory by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast the depression to gradually intensify before weakening and crossing the Baja California Peninsula. Located over warm water temperatures, the system developed {{an area of}} organized, deep convection near the center; with satellite intensity estimates of tropical storm force using the Dvorak technique, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Norman about 12hours after it first formed. Strengthening continued, and Norman attained peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) early on October 10. At the time, it was officially forecast to strengthen further and continue northeastward. However, some hurricane prediction models anticipated quick weakening and a sharp turn to the southeast. Shortly after peaking in intensity, southwesterly wind shear increased, {{which led to a}} decrease in convection coverage. At the same time, a trough extending from California southward caused Norman to stall <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the east. The convection rapidly became separated from the center; by late on October 10, the center was located about 115miles (185km) from the nearest thunderstorms. By then, it had weakened to tropical depression status, and early on October 11 Norman degenerated into a remnant low about 530miles (855km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Within 12 {{hours of}} forming, the {{depression}} intensified into Tropical Storm Fernanda. Banding features increased, and outflow became well-established throughout the storm. Fernanda intensified further and attained hurricane status late on August 10. Soon after, a large eye became evident on satellite imagery, which became more distinct and organized. The hurricane subsequently underwent rapid intensification, and by August 12, Fernanda reached peak winds of 145mph (230km/h); at that time, {{it was a}} Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and was located about 1070 miles (1725km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The peak winds were based on estimates from the Dvorak technique. After maintaining peak winds for about 18 hours, the hurricane began a slow weakening trend. By August 14, the eye had become less distinct as the storm moved over cooler waters, while winds decreased to below major hurricane status, or Category 3 intensity. At that time, the NHC forecast Fernanda to decelerate <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the northwest, although the possibility of a more westward track toward Hawaii was noted.|$|E
5|$|Early morning 11 March, the LSSAH {{launched}} a two-prong attack into northern Kharkov. The 2nd Panzergrenadier Regiment, advancing from the Northwest, split up into two columns advancing towards northern Kharkov {{on either side}} of the Belgorod-Kharkov railroad. The 2nd Battalion, on the right side of the railroad, attacked the city's Severnyi Post district, meeting heavy resistance and advancing only to the Severenyi railway yard by the end of the day. On the opposite side of the railroad, the 1st Battalion struck at the district of Alexeyevka, meeting a T-34-led Soviet counterattack which drove part of the 1st Battalion back out of the city. Only with aerial and artillery support, coming from Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers and StuG assault guns, were the German infantry able to battle their way into the city. A flanking attack from the rear finally allowed the German forces to achieve a foothold in that area of the city. Simultaneously, the 1st SS Panzergrenadier Regiment, with armor attached from a separate unit, attacked down the main road from Belgorod, fighting an immediate counterattack produced over the Kharkov's airport, coming on their left flank. Fighting their way past Soviet T-34s, this German contingent was able to lodge itself into Kharkov's northern suburbs. From the northeast, another contingent of German infantry, armor and self-propelled guns attempted to take control of the road exits to the cities of Rogan and Chuhuiv. This attack penetrated deeper into Kharkov, but low on fuel the armor was forced to entrench itself <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the defensive.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} causes Katarn {{to distance}} himself from the Force and return to mercenary missions with Jan Ors. In Jedi Outcast, Ors is captured by Desann, a former pupil of Luke Skywalker who has turned to the Dark Side. Katarn believes Desann to have killed Ors, and so he returns to the Valley of the Jedi in an attempt to reconnect to the Force so as to stop Desann. Eventually, it is revealed that Ors' death is a ruse by Desann {{for the express purpose of}} having Katarn return to the Valley, so Desann may learn of its location. Desann, in league with the Imperial Remnant, uses the power of the Valley to endow his troops with Force power, before using them to launch an attack on the Jedi Academy. However, Katarn defeats Desann and discovers his true path, becoming a tutor at the Academy. In Jedi Academy, Katarn takes on two students: Jaden Korr and Rosh Penin. The protagonist of the game is Jaden, who is dispatched on various peace-keeping missions across the galaxy, sometimes with Katarn, sometimes alone. Jaden eventually encounters a Sith cult led by Tavion (Desann's former apprentice) who plans to restore the Sith to power by using stolen Force energy to resurrect an ancient Sith Lord, Marka Ragnos. After learning that Rosh has betrayed the Jedi and joined Tavion, Jaden may either kill him <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the Dark Side or let him live and remain on the Light Side. If Jaden chooses to free Rosh, he ultimately faces and defeats both Tavion and the spirit of Ragnos. If he chooses the Dark Side, he kills Tavion, fights and defeats (but does not kill) Katarn, and then flees with Tavion's staff, which is capable of absorbing the Force. The game ends with Katarn setting out in pursuit of Jaden.|$|E

25|$|The Commission also {{deals with}} matters of succession. When a boss dies or retires, his clan's {{reputation}} often crumbles with his departure. This can cause clients {{to abandon the}} clan <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> neighboring clans for protection. These clans would grow greatly in status and power relative to their rivals, potentially destabilizing the region and precipitating war. The Commission may choose to divide up the clan's territory and members among its neighbors. Alternatively, the commission {{has the power to}} appoint a regent for the clan until it can elect a new boss.|$|E

25|$|Banksia lindleyana, {{commonly}} known as the porcupine banksia, is a species of woody shrub in the genus Banksia of the family Proteaceae. It generally grows as a small shrub to 1m (3ft) high with long narrow serrated leaves, and bright yellow oval or round inflorescences. Flowering occurs in late summer, after which time the flower spikes age <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> brown and then grey, and develop up to 70 follicles. It occurs in the vicinity of Kalbarri, Western Australia. Found on sandy soils, the plant serves as a pollinator for a variety of bird and animal species.|$|E
25|$|Between 1713 and 1714, a {{succession}} of peace treaties was signed which ended the War of the Spanish Succession. With {{the end of this}} conflict, thousands of seamen, including Britain's paramilitary privateers, were relieved of military duty. The result was a large number of trained, idle sailors {{at a time when the}} cross-Atlantic colonial shipping trade was beginning to boom. In addition, Europeans who had been pushed by unemployment to become sailors and soldiers involved in slaving were often enthusiastic to abandon that profession <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> pirating, giving pirate captains for many years a constant pool of trained European recruits to be found in west African waters and coasts.|$|E
25|$|Hunting for {{sperm whales}} {{during this period}} was a {{notoriously}} dangerous affair for the crews of the 19th-century whaleboats.

A commonly reported tactic was for the whale to invert itself and violently thrash {{the surface of the water}} with its , flipping and crushing nearby boats.|$|E

25|$|The Tories were a {{more likely}} source of support given their {{commitment}} to church and king, but many were reluctant to trust the Church of England to a Catholic king. At times such as 1715–1722 when the Hanoverians appeared to be dismantling Anglican dominance and 1743–1745 when Whig dealings denied the Tories a parliamentary victory they would coalesce <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the Jacobites, but they were reluctant {{when it came to}} serious action. Nevertheless, this gave hopes that large numbers of Tories would support a Jacobite rising with a serious prospect of winning, particularly when helped by foreign intervention.

25|$|Tensions {{begin to}} arise within the Maroons when Adéwalé plots further raids against the slave trade. Bastienne objects, as de Fayet will only punish those trapped in slavery further as punishment. Adéwalé ignores her, but is horrified when he {{witnesses}} a frigate fire on an unarmed slave ship {{to prevent the}} slaves from joining the Maroons. Adéwalé boards the slave ship and manages to save a few slaves from drowning before the ship capsized with the rest. He plans retribution, but Bastienne cautions that taking revenge will weaken the Maroons' cause; if Adéwalé is to kill de Fayet, then he should do so acting {{as an agent of}} justice. After assaulting the Governor's Mansion, pursuing him through the city and fighting off a local garrison, Adéwalé finally corners and kills de Fayet, who claims that slaves are incapable of self-governance <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> armed uprising at the slightest provocation. Adéwalé points out that none of the slaves or overseers came to his aid, and instead let him die. After killing de Fayet, Adéwalé returns to say goodbye to Bastienne before returning to the Assassin Order, but pledging to use his newfound convictions to aid people who are oppressed rather than the cause of their would-be liberators.|$|E
