5|$|Some non-aqueous {{solvents}} can {{behave as}} acids. An <b>acidic</b> solvent will increase basicity of substances dissolved in it. For example, the compound CH3COOH {{is known as}} acetic acid because of its <b>acidic</b> behaviour in water. However it behaves as a base in liquid hydrogen chloride, a much more <b>acidic</b> solvent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Acidic</b> runoff {{disrupts}} aquatic ecosystems, {{and highly}} <b>acidic</b> soil contaminated by this runoff {{will not support}} vegetation, which is unsightly, {{and can lead to}} problems with soil erosion.|$|E
5|$|In {{groundwater}} strontium behaves chemically {{much like}} calcium. At intermediate to <b>acidic</b> pH Sr2+ {{is the dominant}} strontium species. In the presence of calcium ions, strontium commonly forms coprecipitates with calcium minerals such as calcite and anhydrite at an increased pH. At intermediate to <b>acidic</b> pH, dissolved strontium is bound to soil particles by cation exchange.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is an {{oxidizing}} agent. Depending on the reaction, {{this may}} be due to the Pb2+(aq) ion, which has a standard reduction potential (E0) of −0.125V, or the nitrate ion, which under <b>acidic</b> conditions has an E0 of +0.956V. The nitrate would function at high temperatures or in an <b>acidic</b> condition, while the lead(II) works best in a neutral aqueous solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} soil in Leonard Harrison State Park {{is somewhat}} excessively drained Oquaga channery loam, {{which is often}} associated with well drained Lordstown channery loam. Much of the campground near the eastern boundary is supported by Morris gravelly silt loam, which is somewhat poorly drained due to a subsoil fragipan. The Oquaga tends to be very strongly <b>acidic</b> (pH 4.8), Morris is strongly <b>acidic</b> (pH 5.3) and Lordstown is moderately <b>acidic</b> (pH 5.5). All of these soils belong to the Inceptisol soil order.|$|E
5|$|Asplenium montanum may be {{cultivated}} outdoors or in a terrarium. In either case, {{the soil}} used should be amended with chips of <b>acidic</b> rock.|$|E
5|$|Because this {{blend of}} crude oil is heavy and highly <b>acidic,</b> it fetches lower prices than {{benchmark}} crudes such as Brent or Minas.|$|E
5|$|Bricks may decay due to {{crystallization}} of salts on {{the brick}} or in its pores, from frost action and from <b>acidic</b> gases.|$|E
5|$|For {{determination}} of boron content in food or materials the colorimetric curcumin method is used. Boron {{is converted to}} boric acid or borates and on reaction with curcumin in <b>acidic</b> solution, a red colored boron-chelate complex, rosocyanine, is formed.|$|E
5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in the wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. <b>Acidic</b> fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. <b>Acidic</b> fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E

5|$|In {{areas with}} <b>acidic</b> soils, {{there is less}} calcium available, {{potentially}} leading to thinner egg shells. In such locations, pipits {{are more likely to}} select snails and similar prey with calcium-rich shells than is the case in limestone terrain.|$|E
5|$|In {{this case}} the acid does not dissociate, it is the base, H2O that dissociates. A {{solution}} of B(OH)3 is <b>acidic</b> because hydrogen ions are liberated in this reaction.|$|E
5|$|Interaction of DNA (in orange) with histones (in blue). These proteins' basic {{amino acids}} bind to the <b>acidic</b> {{phosphate}} groups on DNA.|$|E
5|$|Ionization of acids is less in an <b>acidic</b> solvent than in water. For example, {{hydrogen}} chloride is a weak acid when dissolved in acetic acid. This is because acetic acid {{is a much}} weaker base than water.|$|E
5|$|Iron(III) {{chloride}} is harmful, highly corrosive and <b>acidic.</b> The anhydrous {{material is}} a powerful dehydrating agent.|$|E
5|$|Iron(III) {{chloride}} undergoes hydrolysis {{to give an}} <b>acidic</b> solution. When heated with iron(III) oxide at 350°C, iron(III) chloride gives iron oxychloride, a layered {{solid and}} intercalation host.|$|E
5|$|Many {{vanadium}} oxyhalides (formula VOmXn) are known. The oxytrichloride and oxytrifluoride (VOCl3 and VOF3) are {{the most}} widely studied. Akin to POCl3, they are volatile, adopt tetrahedral structures in the gas phase, and are Lewis <b>acidic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} of antimony is characteristic of a nonmetal. Antimony has some definite cationic chemistry, SbO+ and Sb(OH)2+ being present in <b>acidic</b> aqueous solution; the compound Sb8(GaCl4)2, which contains the homopolycation, Sb82+, was prepared in 2004. It can form alloys {{with one or more}} metals such as aluminium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, tin, lead and bismuth. Antimony has fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. Like arsenic, antimony generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. The +5 state is less stable than the +3, but relatively easier to attain than with arsenic. This is explained by the poor shielding afforded the arsenic nucleus by its 3d10 electrons. In comparison, the tendency of antimony (being a heavier atom) to oxidize more easily partially offsets the effect of its 4d10 shell. Tripositive antimony is amphoteric; pentapositive antimony is (predominately) <b>acidic.</b> Consistent with an increase in metallic character down group 15, antimony forms salts or salt-like compounds including a nitrate Sb(NO3)3, phosphate SbPO4, sulfate Sb2(SO4)3 and perchlorate Sb(ClO4)3. The otherwise <b>acidic</b> pentoxide Sb2O5 shows some basic (metallic) behaviour in that it can be dissolved in very <b>acidic</b> solutions, with the formation of the oxycation SbO. The oxide Sb2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. Antimony has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoantimony chemistry).|$|E
5|$|Near Benton, Fishing Creek's pH {{ranges from}} around 5.6 to 7.25, while near Bloomsburg, {{a wider range}} has been recorded, from 5.8 to 8.5. Near Camp Lavigne, it ranges from 5.5 to 7.1. East Branch Fishing Creek is the only stream in the {{watershed}} whose pH drops below 5.5; it can fall as low as 4.9. West Creek and Coles Creek are the least <b>acidic</b> streams in the watershed, with pH levels usually above 6.3 and often above 7. Typically, the creek and its tributaries are not at risk of becoming too <b>acidic</b> for the optimal health of fish, but in early spring during snowmelts, the levels approach the limit that brook trout can tolerate. Fishing Creek's waters are <b>acidic</b> because of acid rain.|$|E
5|$|Other archaea {{exist in}} very <b>acidic</b> or {{alkaline}} conditions. For example, {{one of the}} most extreme archaean acidophiles is Picrophilus torridus, which grows at pH0, which is equivalent to thriving in 1.2molar sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Other {{potentially}} damaging materials include non-archival quality cardboard, card, paper, {{cotton and}} cork, {{all of which}} give off <b>acidic</b> vapors over time. PVC and polyurethane plastics are also a problem, as they degrade and give off <b>acidic</b> vapors with time. High humidity of the air is a significant contributing factor, as is lack of ventilation of the specimens. High ambient temperatures can increase the rapidity of the decay.|$|E
5|$|Other {{products}} of hydrolysis include the trimeric ion 3+. Beryllium hydroxide, Be(OH)2, is insoluble even in <b>acidic</b> solutions with pH less than 6, {{that is at}} biological pH. It is amphoteric and dissolves in strongly alkaline solutions.|$|E
5|$|Solutions of {{beryllium}} salts, e.g. beryllium sulfate and beryllium nitrate, are <b>acidic</b> {{because of}} hydrolysis of the 2+ ion.|$|E
5|$|Some of Catawissa Creek's tributaries {{are known}} to contain trout, but the creek itself does not contain any fish due to {{pollution}} from <b>acidic</b> mine drainage. In 1966, some woodcocks were observed to live along Catawissa Creek.|$|E
5|$|The Fischer indole {{synthesis}} is {{a chemical}} reaction {{that produces the}} aromatic heterocycle indole from a (substituted) phenylhydrazine and an aldehyde or ketone under <b>acidic</b> conditions. The reaction was discovered in 1883 by Hermann Emil Fischer.|$|E
5|$|The {{headwaters}} of Buffalo Creek are <b>acidic</b> due to geological formations that occur there. Also, {{the federal government}} states that there are 3945 acres of flood plains in the watershed. There are 800 acres of wetlands in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|The newly exposed shale on the cut face weathers rapidly, {{allowing}} air {{and water}} into the unexcavated rock, resulting in <b>acidic</b> surface runoff after precipitation events.|$|E
5|$|The soils in the {{watershed}} of West Branch Fishing Creek are <b>acidic</b> {{because of a}} lack of limestone.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{lead for}} water pipes is {{problematic}} {{in areas with}} soft or <b>acidic</b> water. Hard water forms insoluble layers in the pipes whereas soft and <b>acidic</b> water dissolves the lead pipes. Dissolved {{carbon dioxide in the}} carried water may result in the formation of soluble lead bicarbonate; oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as lead(II) hydroxide. Drinking such water, over time, can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead. The harder the water the more calcium bicarbonate and sulfate it will contain, and the more the inside of the pipes will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate.|$|E
5|$|The water then {{carefully}} evaporated from the <b>acidic</b> solution to produce crystals of SnCl2·2H2O. This dihydrate can be dehydrated to anhydrous using acetic anhydride.|$|E
5|$|The {{waters of}} Buffalo Creek are {{slightly}} <b>acidic,</b> with a pH ranging between 5.0 and 6.7. Metals such as magnesium {{have been observed}} in the waters. Nonmetals in the water include dissolved oxygen, calcium carbonate, suspended solids, and phosphorus.|$|E
5|$|The wood used {{to build}} the track is now classed as bog-wood, the name given to wood (of any source) that for long periods (sometimes {{hundreds}} of thousands of years) has been buried in peat bogs, and kept from decaying by the <b>acidic</b> and anaerobic bog conditions. Bog-wood usually is stained brown by tannins dissolved in the <b>acidic</b> water, and represents an early stage of fossilisation. The age of the track prompted large-scale excavations in 1973, funded by the Department of the Environment.|$|E
5|$|The α- and γ- {{forms of}} {{scandium}} oxide hydroxide (ScO(OH)), are isostructural with their aluminium oxide hydroxide counterparts. Solutions of Sc3+ in water are <b>acidic</b> because of hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|This {{classification}} {{is important}} in geochemistry. Minerals such as olivine, (Mg,Fe)SiO4 are classed as ultramafic; olivine is a compound of a very basic oxide, MgO, with an <b>acidic</b> oxide, silica, SiO2.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{its entire}} length, Scotch Run is {{infertile}} and <b>acidic.</b> It {{has the potential}} to be affected by acid precipitation.|$|E
