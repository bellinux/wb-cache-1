40|$|Abstract—We model a {{degraded}} {{image as}} an original image {{that has been}} subject to linear <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> and additive noise injection. Since the psychovisual effects of <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> and noise injection are independent, we decouple these two sources of degradation and measure their effect on the human visual system. We develop a distortion measure (DM) {{of the effect of}} <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion,</b> and a noise quality measure (NQM) of the effect of additive noise. The NQM, which is based on Peli’s contrast pyramid, takes into account the following: 1) variation in contrast sensitivity with distance, image dimensions, and spatial frequency; 2) variation in the local luminance mean; 3) contrast interaction between spatial frequencies; 4) contrast masking effects. For additive noise, we demonstrate that the nonlinear NQM is a better measure of visual quality than peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and linear quality measures. We compute the DM in three steps. First, we find the <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> in the degraded image. Second, we compute the deviation of this <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> from an allpass response of unity gain (no distortion). Finally, we weight the deviation by a model of the frequency response of the human visual system and integrate over the visible frequencies. We demonstrate how to decouple distortion and additive noise degradation in a practical image restoration system. Index Terms—Computational vision, human visual system modeling, image quality.

40|$|International audienceTime domain {{specifications}} such as overshoot, {{rise time}} and tracking behaviour can be extracted from an <b>amplitude</b> <b>frequency</b> response. For uncertain systems we use for this an {{upper bound on}} the maximum <b>amplitude</b> <b>frequency</b> response. There are tools which can compute this upper bound for each frequency in a grid.

We will augment the uncertainty set with an additional uncertain parameter. This uncertain parameter will cover the frequencies which are not covered by the grid. This allows us to do a robustness analysis for a range of frequencies.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the feasibility of a satellite attitude fine-control system using the interaction of the earth's magnetic field with current-carrying coils to produce torque. The approximate intensity of the earth's magnetic field was determined {{as a function of the}} satellite coordinates. Components of the magnetic field were found to vary essentially sinusoidally at approximately twice orbital <b>frequency.</b> <b>Amplitude</b> and <b>distortion</b> of the sinusoidal components were a function of satellite orbit. Two systems for two-axis attitude control evolved from this study, one using three coils and the other using two coils. The torques developed by the two systems differ only when the component of magnetic field along the tracking line is zero. For this case the two-coil system develops no torque whereas the three-coil system develops some effective torque which allows partial control. The equations which describe the three-coil system are complex in comparison to those of the two-coil system and require the measurement of all three components of the magnetic field as compared with only one for the two-coil case. Intermittent three-axis torquing can also be achieved. This torquing can be used for coarse attitude control, or for dumping the stored momentum of inertia reaction wheels. Such a system has the advantage of requiring no fuel aboard the satellite. For any of these magnetic torquing schemes the power required to produce the magnetic moment and the weight of the coil seem reasonable...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, the {{development}} of synthetic gene networks has attracted much attention from many researchers. In particular, the genetic oscillator known as the repressilator has become a paradigm for how to design a gene network with a desired dynamic behaviour. Even though the repressilator can show oscillatory properties in its protein concentrations, their <b>amplitudes,</b> <b>frequencies</b> and phases are perturbed by the kinetic parametric fluctuations (intrinsic molecular perturbations) and external disturbances (extrinsic molecular noises) of the environment. Therefore, how to design a robust genetic oscillator with desired <b>amplitude,</b> <b>frequency</b> and phase under stochastic intrinsic and extrinsic molecular noises is an important topic for synthetic biology. In this study, based on periodic reference signals with arbitrary <b>amplitudes,</b> <b>frequencies</b> and phases, a robust synthetic gene oscillator is designed by tuning the kinetic parameters of repressilator via a genetic algorithm (GA) so that the protein concentrations can track the desired periodic reference signals under intrinsic and extrinsic molecular noises. GA is a stochastic optimization algorithm which {{was inspired by the}} mechanisms of natural selection and evolution genetics. By the proposed GA-based design algorithm, the repressilator can track the desired <b>amplitude,</b> <b>frequency</b> and phase of oscillation under intrinsic and extrinsic noises through the optimization of fitness function. The proposed GA-based design algorithm can mimic the natural selection in evolutionary process to select adequate kinetic parameters for robust genetic oscillators. The design method can be easily extended to any synthetic gene network design with prescribed behaviours...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{main product}} of the DFT {{algorithms}} is the <b>amplitude</b> <b>frequency</b> spectrum while the phase frequency spectrum calculation is mainly unwanted. However, this part becomes relevant in the cases, in which the spectral lines {{have to be considered}} as vectors. Since the data record, from which the frequency spectrum is calculated, is usually acquired by non-coherent sampling, a problem of the correct phase determination appears. Time windows minimise the leakage in the <b>amplitude</b> <b>frequency</b> spectrum; their effect on the phase frequency spectrum is unclear. Moreover, the phase of each frequency depends on its initial phase and it varies in every data record, which is often undesired. One possibility of how to exactly express the phases of higher harmonic components is described in this paper. I.
