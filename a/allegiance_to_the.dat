5|$|During the Nanboku-chō period {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Kamakura shogunate in 1333, Nanbu Motoyuki accompanied Kitabatake Akiie north when he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the North, and Shugo of Mutsu Province. Nanbu Motoyuki established Ne Castle, which was intended to be a center for the imperial government administration in the area. This marked the official transfer of the seat of the Nanbu clan from Kai Province to Mutsu. Nanbu Motoyuki was under <b>allegiance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Southern Court; however, at the same time, another branch of the same Nanbu family ruled the nearby Sannohe and Morioka areas under <b>allegiance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rival Northern Court.

5|$|After {{the defeat}} at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 against the Seljuk Turks and the {{overthrow}} of Romanos IV Diogenes (r. 1068–71), the Byzantine Empire experienced a decade of near-continuous internal turmoil and rebellions. The constant warfare depleted the Empire's armies, devastated Asia Minor and left it defenceless against the increasing encroachment of the Turks. In the Balkans, invasions by the Pechenegs and the Cumans devastated Bulgaria, and the Serbian princes renounced their <b>allegiance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Empire.|$|E

5|$|Not all Texans favored secession initially, {{although}} many of the same would later support the Southern cause. Texas's most notable Unionist was the state Governor, Sam Houston.

40|$|Like most abolitionists, Lincoln denounced slavery as an unmitigated moral {{evil that}} {{violated}} the founding {{principles of the}} American Republic. But unlike them he did not call for its immediate abolition and black citizenship {{for most of his}} political career. This lecture explores this seeming paradox by examining Lincoln’s competing political <b>allegiances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States Constitution, which contained some protections for slavery, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> American Union, built on constitutional compromises over slavery, and his evolving antislavery views. It charts his emergence as an antislavery politician in the 1850 s, when Lincoln struggled to reconcile his reverence for the Constitution with his growing antislavery convictions, from his support of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 to his denunciation of the Dred Scott decision in 1857. Lincoln’s personal journey illustrates that antislavery constitutionalism was never a given but was the hard-fought result of decades of abolitionist agitation and its eventual adoption by free soil politicians such as him. During the Civil War, Lincoln would continue to struggle to resolve his conflicting political <b>allegiances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Union, Constitution, and antislavery as he moved slowly but surely toward the abolitionists’ twin goals of emancipation and black citizenship...|$|R
50|$|From 1950 <b>to</b> 1973, <b>the</b> stated {{interests}} of the diocese politically were often local interests and aligned somewhat with labor unions and {{what had been a}} traditional Democratic, blue-collar political base, although the rural districts of <b>the</b> diocese tended <b>to</b> support more conservative political perspectives. After 1973, U.S. Catholics began to transition from their traditional <b>allegiances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party and seek out political candidates that supported Catholic perspectives on <b>the</b> need <b>to</b> protect human life; these were often Republicans.|$|R
5|$|The Governor-General of the Congo, Pierre Ryckmans, {{decided on}} the day of Belgium's {{surrender}} that the colony would remain loyal to the Allies, {{in stark contrast to the}} French colonies that later pledged <b>allegiance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pro-German Vichy government. The Congo was therefore administered from London by the Belgian government in exile during the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} fought {{three weeks after}} the Austrian {{capitulation}} at Ulm and three weeks before the Russo-Austrian defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz.

5|$|Three brigades of the Force Publique {{were sent}} to Abyssinia {{alongside}} British forces to fight the Italians in June 1940.

Ecclesiastically, these cities retained their former <b>allegiances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> metropolitan bishops of Syria Prima and Secunda: Antioch and Apamea in Syria.

5|$|Vizzini is {{the central}} {{character}} {{in the history of}} direct Mafia support for the Allied Forces during the invasion of Sicily in 1943. After World War II he became the personification of the reinstatement of Cosa Nostra during the Allied occupation and the subsequent restoration of democracy after the repression under Fascist rule. Initially he supported the separatist movement, but changed <b>allegiance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Christian Democrat party, {{when it became clear that}} Sicilian independence was unfeasible.|$|E
40|$|As Morten Egeberg writes, {{international}} organisations are typically composed of representatives with affiliations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> national level.

Assessing the potential for <b>the</b> Commission <b>to</b> act as a ‘laboratory’ for experiments in supranational institution building, he finds that nationality plays only a minor role in influencing the behaviour of Commission staff, and is simply one of many factors influencing the actions of Commissioners...|$|R
50|$|A year later, Pedley {{concluded}} the British Youth Council {{was under the}} control of its non-executive BYC staff members such as John Denham and Rex Osbourne who owed their <b>allegiances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left and were manipulating <b>the</b> organisation <b>to</b> take an increasingly anti-government line.
