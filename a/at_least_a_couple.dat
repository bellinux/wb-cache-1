25|$|At {{least one}} {{contributing}} mechanism for reduced spermatogenesis in cryptorchid testes is temperature. The temperature of testes in the scrotum is <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of degrees cooler {{than in the}} abdomen. Animal experiments {{in the middle of}} the 20th century suggested that raising the temperature could damage fertility. Some circumstantial evidence suggests tight underwear and other practices that raise the testicular temperature for prolonged periods can be associated with lower sperm counts. Nevertheless, research in recent decades suggests that the issue of fertility is more complex than a simple matter of temperature. It seems likely that subtle or transient hormone deficiencies or other factors that lead to a lack of descent also impair the development of spermatogenic tissue.|$|E
25|$|At {{the death}} of her husband, Maria Isabella’s eldest son became King Ferdinand II.

The plot was discovered and immediately crushed by the young king. Ferdinand II was only 20 years old. Shy and quiet, he was, however, more energetic than his father and grandfather had been and took his duties as king more seriously. The relationship between Maria Isabella and Ferdinand II was cold. The Queen mother had a marked preference for her second son, Charles, Prince of Capua, who was more outgoing and shared her frivolity.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, Ganpal Lal Batto died {{suddenly}} in a road accident. His death left Shamshad very distraught, {{because her husband}} had been the focus of her life and they had both been extremely devoted to each other. He had handled many aspects of her career and contracts and had been a major positive energy behind her career progression. After his death, Shamshad became listless and lost the fighting spirit to pursue her career, which registered a sharp decline thereafter. Indeed, while Shamshad Begum was both an outstanding singer and a successful famous one, she was at some deeper level always a wife and mother first, someone who instinctively prioritised her family over her career. By nature, she preferred to keep away from the public glare and from business dealings, taking the view that it was rather unseemly for a lady to be involved in such things. After her husband's death, Shamshad Begum began living with her daughter and son-in-law in Mumbai, first in south Mumbai and later at Hiranandani Gardens in the Powai neighbourhood. She gradually became a recluse and devoted herself entirely to her grandchildren, {{to the point that the}} general public was unaware of whether she was alive or dead. In 2004, a controversy erupted in the media, when several publications wrongly reported that Shamshad Begum had died a few years previously. Shamshad's family clarified in a press release that this was not so; and it later emerged that the Shamshad Begum who had died in 1998 was Saira Banu's maternal grandmother. Her self-imposed seclusion is remarkable, because during all those decades away from the public eye, her old songs remained popular with the public and not a day passed without <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of songs being played on Vividh Bharati and All India Radio.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} multi-epoch (20 years baseline) kinematical {{investigation}} of HH 52, 53, and 54 at optical and near-IR wavelengths, along with medium and high- resolution spectroscopic analyses, probing the kinematical and physical time variability {{conditions of the}} gas along the flows. By means of multi-epoch and multi-wavelength narrow-band images, we derived proper motions, tangential velocities, velocity and flux variability of the knots. Radial velocities and physical parameters of the gas were derived from spectroscopy. Finally, spatial velocities and inclination of the flows were obtained by combining both imaging and spectroscopy. The P. M. analysis reveals three distinct, partially overlapping outflows. In 20 years, about 60 % of the knots show some degree of flux variability. Our set of observations apparently indicates acceleration and deceleration {{in a variety of}} knots along the jets. For about 20 % of the knots, mostly coincident with working surfaces or interacting knots along the flows, a relevant variability in both flux and velocity is observed. We argue that both variabilities are related and that {{all or part of the}} kinetic energy lost by the interacting knots is successively radiated. The analysis indicates the presence of very light, ionised, and hot flows, impacting a denser medium. Several knots are deflected. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of them (HH 54 G and G 0), the deflection originates from the collision of the two. For the more massive parts of the flow, the deflection is likely the result of the flow collision with a dense cloud or with clumps. Comment: To be published in A&A.
