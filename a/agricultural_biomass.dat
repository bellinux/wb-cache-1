Waste-derived alternative fuels {{are widely used}} to reduce the pollutant emissions {{and the use of}} fossil fuel. Within the cement kiln, it requires about 40 - 50 % of total thermal energy to complete the complex chemical reactions of clinker formation. High kiln temperature and the intrinsic ability for clinker to absorb and lock contaminants into the clinker allow the kiln to burn a wide range of alternative fuels. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>biomasses</b> are one of the emerging alternative fuels in the cement industry due to their availability and very low price. This chapter presents the effects of using <b>agricultural</b> <b>biomasses</b> as alternative fuels on the energy efficiency and emission from the kiln by using Aspen Plus process modeling.

40|$|An {{extensive}} characterization {{was carried}} out on various biomass samples representative of the diversity in France, including forestry samples (softwood and hardwood woodchips, eucalyptus and poplar short rotation coppices), very short rotation coppices (VSRC) samples and agricultural samples (wheat straw, triticale, fescue, miscanthus and switchgrass). The following properties were measured to evaluate suitability with thermochemical process: elemental analysis (C, H, O, N, S, and Cl), chemical composition (extractives, lignin, mono/polysaccharides, acetate groups), ash content and inorganic composition. Carbon and hydrogen contents are quite similar between <b>biomasses.</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>biomasses</b> are usually less oxygenated than forestry biomasses. Nitrogen content is generally higher for <b>agricultural</b> <b>biomasses</b> (up to 1. 4 %) than for forestry biomasses, but important amount {{is also found in}} VSRC (0. 8 % for poplar). Chlorine and sulfur are species-dependent. Fescue and eucalyptus show high values of Cl, while wheat straw has the highest sulfur content. Ash content is very low for forestry and perennial biomasses (miscanthus and switchgrass). For non-perennial crops, values up to 8. 5 % (wheat straw) were measured. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>biomasses</b> contains more silicon (2 % for triticale), magnesium (0. 16 % for fescue), potassium (1. 9 % for fescue) and phosphorus (0. 18 % for fescue), while forestry biomasses are richer in calcium (up to 0. 97 % for poplar VSRC). Other inorganic elements, especially heavy metals are present in very low concentrations {{and most of the time}} below detection limits. Regarding chemical composition, extractive content is very high (20 – 25 %) for non-perennial crops (fescue, wheat straw and triticale) and eucalyptus VSRC. Lignin content seems to be higher for forestry biomasses (21 – 29 %) than for <b>agricultural</b> <b>biomasses</b> (16 – 23 %). The same trend was observed for cellulose, while the opposite was observed for hemicelluloses. These differences in organic and inorganic composition are expected to significantly impact the behavior of these biomasses in thermochemical processes such as gasification for biofuels production.

5000|$|In general {{there are}} two types of feedstocks: forest (woody) Biomass and <b>agricultural</b> <b>biomass.</b> In the US, about 1.4 billion dry tons of biomass can be {{sustainably}} produced annually. About 370 million tons or 30% are forest biomass. [...] Forest biomass has higher cellulose and lignin content and lower hemicellulose and ash content than <b>agricultural</b> <b>biomass.</b> Because of the difficulties and low ethanol yield in fermenting pretreatment hydrolysate, especially those with very high 5 carbon hemicellulose sugars such as xylose, forest biomass has significant advantages over <b>agricultural</b> <b>biomass.</b> Forest biomass also has high density which significantly reduces transportation cost. It can be harvested year around which eliminates long term storage. The close to zero ash content of forest biomass significantly reduces dead load in transportation and processing. To meet the needs for biodiversity, forest biomass will be an important biomass feedstock supply mix in the future biobased economy. However, forest biomass is much more recalcitrant than <b>agricultural</b> <b>biomass.</b> Recently, the USDA Forest Products Laboratory together with the University of Wisconsin-Madison developed efficient technologies that can overcome the strong recalcitrance of forest (woody) biomass including those of softwood species that have low xylan content. Short-rotation intensive culture or tree farming can offer an almost unlimited opportunity for forest biomass production.|$|E

However, there is limited literature reporting the use of ionic liquids in biomass saccharification, which mostly involves the addition of acid or water that conceals the true action of ionic liquid in saccharification. This article assesses the performance of molten Brӧnsted acidic 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hydrogen sulphate ([EMIM][HSO 4]) in saccharifying three <b>agricultural</b> <b>biomasses,</b> namely sago hampas, sugarcane bagasse, and rice husk, via saccharification kinetics. At 100 °C, [EMIM][HSO 4] saccharification of the biomasses achieved equilibrium reducing sugar yields at various durations (sago hampas, 3 h; sugarcane bagasse, 1 h; rice husk, 5 h). The kinetic rate constant was obtained from model fitting, indicated that [EMIM][HSO 4] showed a preference for saccharifying less recalcitrant sugarcane bagasse (37. 9 %) than sago hampas (7. 0 %) and rice husk (1. 1 %). Compared to H 2 SO 4 saccharification, reducing sugar yields of [EMIM][HSO 4] were consistently lower.

40|$|One way of {{reducing}} the emissions of fossil fuel-derived carbon dioxide (CO 2) is to replace fossil fuels with biofuels produced from <b>agricultural</b> <b>biomasses</b> or residuals. However, cultivation of soils results in emission of other greenhouse gasses (GHGs), especially nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Previous studies showed that field emissions of N 2 O may contribute significantly to total GHG emissions during biofuel production. Furthermore, N 2 O may counterbalance a considerable part of the global warming reduction, {{which is achieved by}} fossil fuel displacement. In the present study, we related measured field emissions of N 2 O to the reduction in fossil fuel-derived CO 2, which was obtained when <b>agricultural</b> <b>biomasses</b> were used for biofuel production. The analysis included five organically managed feedstocks (viz. dried straw of sole cropped rye, sole cropped vetch and intercropped rye-vetch, as well as fresh grass-clover and whole crop maize) and three scenarios for conversion of biomass into biofuel. The scenarios were i) bioethanol, ii) biogas and iii) co-production of bioethanol and biogas. In the last scenario, the biomass was first used for bioethanol fermentation and subsequently the effluent from this process was utilized for biogas production. The net GHG reduction was calculated as the avoided fossil fuel-derived CO 2, where the N 2 O emission was subtracted. This value did not account for fossil fuel-derived CO 2 emissions from farm machinery and during conversion processes that turn biomass into biofuel. The greatest net GHG reduction corresponding to 700 - 800 g CO 2 m- 2 yr- 1 was obtained by biogas production or co-production of bioethanol and biogas on either fresh grass-clover or whole crop maize. Maize has become increasingly popular as a feedstock for biofuel production in several regions of Europe. However, we suggest that more emphasis should be placed on perennial N 2 -fixing crops, like grass-clover swards, as suitable alternatives to maize when producing feedstock for biofuels within organic farming...|$|R
50|$|Among {{hydrogen}} production {{methods such as}} steam methane reforming, thermal cracking, coal and biomass gasification and pyrolysis, electrolysis, and photolysis, biological ones are more eco-friendly and less energy intensive. In addition, {{a wide variety of}} waste and low-value materials such as <b>agricultural</b> <b>biomass</b> as renewable sources can be utilized to produce hydrogen via biochemical pathways. Nevertheless, at present hydrogen is produced mainly from fossil fuels, in particular, natural gas which are non-renewable sources. Hydrogen is not only the cleanest fuel but also widely used in a number of industries, especially fertilizer, petrochemical and food ones. This makes it logical to investigate alternative sources for {{hydrogen production}}. The main biochemical technologies to produce hydrogen are dark and photo fermentation processes. In dark fermentation, carbohydrates are converted to hydrogen by fermentative microorganisms including strict anaerobe and facultative anaerobe bacteria. A theoretical maximum of 4 mol H2/mol glucose can be produced and, besides hydrogen, sugars are converted to volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols as by-products during this process. Photo fermentative bacteria are able to generate hydrogen from VFAs. Hence, metabolites formed in dark fermentation can be used as feedstock in photo fermentation to enhance the overall yield of hydrogen.|$|E
