5|$|The first {{principal}} keeper was James Ewing {{who looked}} after the light {{for the next}} eleven years. Despite the exceptionally adverse conditions faced by the keepers, which resulted in them receiving additional payments in kind, Ewing {{was not the only}} one who served the light for a decade or more. However, some found the lonely rock and its cramped quarters less to their taste. One had to be prevented from diving into the sea <b>and</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> swim ashore.|$|E

Police reports reveal he had purchased a Glock pistol at a Sportsman's Warehouse store, after passing the required FBI background check, less than six weeks before and attempted to buy additional ammunition for the pistol at a Walmart {{on the morning of the}} shooting, but the clerk refused to sell it to him based on his appearance and demeanor.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{to begin}} the 1975 season, Ellis {{continued}} to perform well {{at the beginning of}} the season. In August, the Pirates asked Ellis to pitch in the bullpen; he refused on consecutive nights. On August 15, 1975, Ellis refused assignment to the bullpen again; as a result, the Pirates suspended him for one day. Ellis called for a team meeting the next day, where he was expected to apologize. Instead, he berated Murtaugh, who responded by cursing at Ellis, ordering the pitcher out of the clubhouse <b>and</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> fight him. Coach Don Leppert reportedly also tried to fight Ellis. The Pirates suspended Ellis for thirty days and fined him $2,000. The suspension was lifted on August 30 when Ellis apologized to Murtaugh.|$|E

5|$|On 7 September 2007, {{following}} the security breach {{on the previous}} day, Taylor, Reucassel, Dominic Knight and their film crew were detained and questioned over a follow-up stunt. This incident involved running near <b>and</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> enter the APEC protected zone dressed in cardboard cars mounted with Canadian flags, {{a reference to the}} flags' earlier use to disguise the successful breach by the real motorcade. Police {{had no choice but to}} release all members involved in this stunt, as they were outside the prohibited area. This stunt also aired on the 12 September episode.|$|E
5|$|One of Edward's {{persistent}} challenges {{through most}} of his reign was a shortage of money; of the debts he inherited from his father, around £60,000 was still owing in the 1320s. The King {{worked his way through}} many treasurers and other financial officials, few of whom stayed long, raising revenues through often unpopular taxes, and requisitioning goods using his right of prise. He also took out many loans, first through the Frescobaldi family, and then through his banker Antonio Pessagno. Edward took a strong interest in financial matters towards the end of his reign, distrusting his own officials <b>and</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> increase revenues directly by cutting back on the expenses of his own household.|$|E
5|$|Politically, Belgian {{politics}} {{had been}} dominated {{in the interwar period}} by the Catholic Party, usually in coalition with the Belgian Labour Party (POB-BWP) or the Liberal Party. The 1930s {{also saw the}} rise in popularity of Fascist parties within Belgium; most notably Rex which peaked at the 1936 election with 11% of the vote. From the early 1930s, Belgian foreign and domestic policy had been dominated by the policy of neutrality; leaving international treaties and alliances <b>and</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> maintain good diplomatic relations with both Britain, France and Germany.|$|E

A partial search was made, using tracker dogs, {{but all that}} was found were the skeletal remains of a judge who had disappeared years earlier. Police divers searched the harbour, and a partial search using infra-red photography was undertaken the following year, to no avail. A warrant for Lucan's arrest, to answer charges of murdering Sandra Rivett, <b>and</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> murder his wife, was issued on Tuesday 12November 1974. Descriptions of his appearance, already issued to police forces across the UK, were then issued to Interpol.|$|E
5|$|The American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) is also {{native to}} the region and has been {{designated}} as endangered since 1975. Unlike their relatives the alligators, crocodiles tend to thrive in brackish or salt-water habitats such as estuarine or marine coasts. Their most significant threat is disturbance by people. Too much contact with humans causes females to abandon their nests, and males in particular are often victims of vehicle collisions while roaming over large territories <b>and</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> cross U.S. 1 and Card Sound Road in the Florida Keys. There are an estimated 500 to 1,000crocodiles in southern Florida.|$|E
