5|$|M. hirsuta and M. inquilina are {{the only}} known species in this genus that are inquilines and live in other Myrmecia colonies. An M. inquilina queen {{has been found in}} an M. vindex colony. Myrmecia is a larval {{attendant}} to the butterfly Theclinesthes serpentata (saltbush blue), while some species, particularly M. nigrocincta, enslave other ant species, notably those in the genus Leptomyrmex. M. nigriceps ants are able to enter another colony of the same species without being attacked, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> unable to recognize alien conspecifics, nor do they try to distinguish nestmates from ants of another colony. Formicoxenus provancheri and M. brevinoda share a form of symbiotic relationship known as xenobiosis, where one species of ant will live with another and raise their young separately, with M. brevinoda being the host. Solenopsis may sometimes nest in Myrmecia colonies, as a single colony was found to have three or four Solenopsis nests inside. Lagria beetles and rove beetles in the genus Heterothops dwell inside colonies and skinks and frogs have also been found living unmolested within Myrmecia nests. Metacrinia nichollsi, for example, has been reported living inside M. regularis colonies.|$|E

25|$|Although mice {{are small}} animals and {{care must be}} taken to avoid injury, they are also {{surprisingly}} robust and inquisitive. Once out of the cage many enjoy running along their owners' arms, investigating pockets, or just sitting on the owner's lap and grooming. Some mice also tolerate gentle petting. Care must be taken as mice have poor eyesight and may try to lean too far over an edge and fall. Care must especially be taken when being handled by small children <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> overly rough. Fancy mice very rarely bite except when hurt or very frightened. Biting behavior may result from improper handling, as mice are generally considered non-aggressive. They do have a greater likelihood of biting unfamiliar people, especially males who are wild and territorial.|$|E

Most local Singaporean Chinese {{dishes such as}} Bak kut teh, Mee pok, Ban mian, Char kway teow, Chee cheong fun, Hokkien mee, Hainanese chicken rice, Wan ton mee, and Popiah can still be easily found in food centres throughout Singapore. Some Singaporean Chinese are vegetarians, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> devoted followers of Buddhism.

Retaliation can even involve further sexual harassment, and also stalking and cyberstalking of the victim. Moreover, a school professor or employer accused of sexual harassment, or who is the colleague of a perpetrator, can use their power to see that a victim is never hired again(blacklisting), or never accepted to another school.|$|E
500|$|Alternatively, the two {{variations}} of RAD may develop {{from the same}} inability to develop [...] "stranger-wariness" [...] due to inadequate care.

An infant who is {{not in a position to}} do this cannot afford not to show interest in any person <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> potential attachment figures. Faced with a swift succession of carers the child may have no opportunity to form a selective attachment until the possible biologically-determined sensitive period for developing stranger-wariness has passed. It is thought this process may lead to the disinhibited form.|$|E

Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media was more critical of the song, commenting that [...] "Raining Men is a shameless Beyoncé rip-off that would be quickly dismissed if not for the fact that it's a pretty-damn-good Beyoncé rip off with a characteristically scene-stealing guest verse from Nicki Minaj". James Reed of The Boston Globe also noticed the similarity between the song's composition and the work of American R recording artist Beyoncé Knowles, saying [...] "'Raining Men', borrowing a digitized riff from Beyoncé's 'Diva', features rising rapper Nicki Minaj on a typically manic guest rhyme. The song's message doubles as the album's mantra: Some cats really do have nine lives".
