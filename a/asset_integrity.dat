A Systems Information Model (SIM) was used to retrospectively create a connected system to ensure all physical equipment and the associated connections that were constructed are modelled in an object-orientated database. In creating the SIM, the existing errors and omissions in the ‘As-built’ documentation were quantified, and cost savings that could be achieved for a future planned copper mine, with a similar design, were identified. The limitations of using conventional computer-aided-design (CAD) to design and document EICS are discussed. It is recommended that retrospectively creating a SIM can provide owners and operators with significant productivity benefits as well as ensure the <b>asset's</b> <b>integrity.</b> The case study presented provides asset owners and operators with the empirical evidence to challenge conventional thinking surrounding the design, engineering and documentation of EICS using CAD and alternatively consider the use of SIM.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{inspection}} services {{as part of}} a site’s management of buried and underground pipe and tank programs has been increasing {{over the last several years}} in support of NEI Initiative 09 - 14 – Guideline for the Management of Underground Piping and Tank Integrity. Unlike traditional NDE methods that utilize direct contact with a material surface for inspection, buried pipe inspections utilize “Indirect Inspection ” methodologies to gain insight into the condition of the pipe without the need for excavation. Once adverse signatures are observed, excavation and quantitative examinations using traditional NDE methods are used. A secondary benefit of this approach is that the disposition of large amounts of pipe with minimal likelihood for significant degradation can be established, saving the site valuable time and resources while maintaining the reasonable assurance of an <b>asset’s</b> <b>integrity</b> for safe operation. This approach optimizes inspection planning at locations with the greatest potential for worst-case external corrosion degradation. This paper will present two methods, APEC and GWT, and the data integration and analysis processes used to arrive at prioritized recommendations regarding a pipe’s condition. An example will be used to demonstrate how the data supports corrosion engineering decisions used to establish the reasonable assurance of buried pipe integrity...|$|R

50|$|<b>Asset</b> <b>integrity</b> is {{the ability}} of an oil and gas asset to perform its {{required}} function effectively and efficiently whilst protecting health, safety and the environment. <b>Asset</b> <b>integrity</b> management is the means of ensuring that the people, systems, processes and resources that deliver integrity are in place, in use and will perform when required over the whole lifecycle of the asset. In 2004, the HSE highlighted the infrastructure on which work was required to maintain integrity and £4 billion was subsequently spent in the area of asset maintenance. In 2009, the HSE confirmed that the key issues identified earlier had been resolved. Specific initiatives now encourage industry wide engagement and continued investment in <b>asset</b> <b>integrity.</b> On a global level, <b>Asset</b> <b>Integrity</b> continues to be ranked amongst the oil and gas industry's biggest challenges and main focus areas, In spite of this, recent research by Oil and Gas Fundamentals has indicated that understanding of the subject inside the industry is still not where it needs to be.|$|E

40|$|Consequence {{assessment}} {{is an integral}} part of the risk assessment process carried out by the industry to minimize impact of assets failure on the environment, human safety, <b>assets</b> <b>integrity</b> and business reputation. A few components of consequences loss occur due to the pipeline failure, such as asset loss, environmental loss, production loss, public loss and Human Health and Safety Loss (HHSL). This study focuses on HHSL by considering the losses in term of monetary value between rural and urban areas due to pipeline failure. Based on the current technical standard practiced in the industry, the calculated consequences are speculated to generate an equal risk value to any area of the pipeline throughout the country, regardless of the areas unique local factors and consequences. Hence, this would lead to the deterioration in the quality of the estimated risk. As for the damaged area, Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) software was employed in the calculation of risk by considering the pipeline data and the details of selected sites such as atmospheric and demographic condition. The HHSL was calculated using a developed mathematical equation of quantitative risk assessment in terms of the number of fatalities or injuries or both in monetary value. The results of the assessments from rural and urban areas were then compared with one another to identify the occurrence of any significant dissimilarity. The major finding of this research showed that there is a possibility to enhance the decisive value of risk by implementing the proposed approach of HHSL estimation for consequence assessment...|$|R

40|$|Information {{security}} {{is all about}} the protection of digital assets, such as digital content, personal health records, state secrets etc. These assets can be handled by a party who is authorised to access and control the asset or a party who is not authorised to do so. Authorisation determines who is trusted to actually handle an asset. Two concepts complement authorisation. Authentication deter-mines who makes a request to handle an asset. To decide who is authorised, a system needs to au-thenticate the user. There are three different ways in which users can be authenticated. You can use something you know (e. g. password, pin code), something you have (e. g. smart card, RFID tag) or something are (e. g. finger print, your gait). These methods can be combined to provide stronger au-thentication than when they are applied individually. Auditing makes it possible to determine who handled an asset and how, so that ultimately an attacker can be prosecuted. The three concepts are known collectively as the ‘gold standard’, since ‘Au’ is the chemical symbol for gold (Lampson, 2004). There are three important security properties of digital assets. Confidentiality is the ability of a system to stop unauthorised users from handling protected <b>assets.</b> <b>Integrity</b> is the assurance that every asset or system component is exactly as the last authorised party to modify it has left it. Availability is the assurance that authorised users may find the system to work as they expect it to, when they expect it to.

40|$|Quite often main issues {{occurred}} in unmanned platform due to erosion on XTree. The frozen well intervention {{system is a}} typical remedial job to resolve this kind of problem, generating extremely high costs, between 3, 5 MMUSD and 12 MMUSD per intervention. Eni conducts pipe erosion studies using a JIP with Tulsa University; however, no dedicated analysis were demanded on Xtree valves geometries. An R&D project was created to cover this gap, in order to replace the current corrective maintenance approach with a preventive one. A new erosion Prediction Model for XTree Valves, both subsea and surface in brown fields, was developed to increase wells life expectancy and maximize the <b>assets</b> <b>integrity.</b> In order to do such thing jointly with Politecnico di Milano University, there has been {{the development of the}} project by steps: first, the design of a fluid-dynamic model that analyzes the sand particle interaction with the Xtree valves components, and then an experimental laboratory set-ups design has been performed. Finally the validation of the prediction model with experimental results. The prediction model has been integrated in a tool that adds erosion alerts to Eni wells integrity dashboard and constitutes an upgrade to the internal wells control tool. The delivered software helps to plan the equipment maintenance activities, especially in brown fields, intensely reducing remedial jobs performed in emergency conditions. Moreover, the project achievements can also be extended for additional applications, such as: studies on new non-metallic materials characterization in harsh conditions, usage validation for valves/pipe coatings and supply additional information to support well completion design.
