40|$|In {{order to}} {{visualize}} the SPIRAL 2 beam dynamics, several beam profile monitors are under development. Multiwires beam profile monitors (SEM) will be used on the driver and RIB lines. Non interceptive beam profile monitor (RGM) should be mounted on the LINAC diagnostics box before experiments room, and low intensity beam profile monitor (EFM) on the RIB lines For the signals acquisition of all this kind of monitor, a new associated electronics will be used. These electronics digitize 94 channels in a parallel system. Each channel integrates the current of the <b>associated</b> <b>wire</b> or strip and performs a current-voltage conversion. The dedicated GANIL data display software has been adapted for these different new monitors. SPIRAL 2 DESCRIPTION The SPIRAL 2 facility {{is based on a}} high-power superconducting driver LINAC which delivers a high-intensity, 40 -MeV deuteron beam, as well as a variety of heavy-ion beams with mass-to-charge ratio equal to 3 and energy up to 14. 5 MeV/u (Table 1). The driver accelerator will send stable beams to a new experimental area and to a cave for the production of Radioactive Ion Beams (RIB). The Accelerator building construction (phase 1) will started in 2010 and the RIB production building (phase 2) in 2012 (Fig. 1). The commissioning of the driver should start in 2011 at GANIL...|$|E
