Since these model information is also <b>acessed</b> at run time for execution, we can avoid the situation that program code and high-level specifications are out of synch. Since the program code is thus a valid notation for the model syntax, we can apply transformations based on model semantics to it.

This leads to a new perspective of software evolution in which the program code can be considered at higher levels of abstraction. ...|$|R

Famous cases of sensitive information leaks caused by insiders, including the WikiLeaks release of diplomatic cables and the Edward Snowden incident, have greatly harmed the U.

Data Leak Prevention (DLP) is a solution for detecting and preventing information leaks from within an organization's network.

40|$|Vasoconstrictor {{responsiveness}} of {{the systemic}} circulation is attenuated following prolonged exposure to hypoxia. Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated vasoconstrictor reactivity is diminished due to hyperpolarization of the vascular wall in systemic arterioles. The hyperpolarization of the vascular wall {{was found to}} be dependent upon the endothelium, heme oxygenase (HO), and calcium-activated large conductance potassium channel (BKCa) as removal of the endothelium or blockade of HO or BKCa restored vasoreactivity. Interestingly, recent evidence for HO and BKCa association has emerged in carotid body glomus cells where HO and BKCa form oxygen sensing complexes. In these novel oxygen sensing complexes, HO-derived CO activates BKCa channels in localized domains that regulate carotid body membrane potential. The presence and function of HO and BKCa association has not been previously <b>acessed</b> in the systemic endothelium. The following studies investigated a novel HO-BKCa functional unit in systemic vascular endothelial cells. In whole cell patch clamp experiments it was demonstrated that HO-dependent activation of BKCa significantly increased transmembrane currents in ECs following CH. Additionally, HO-dependent BKCa activity was unearthed following disruption of caveolin- 1 function or potentially inhibited following incubation with the caveolin- 1 scaffolding domain, demonstrating the inhibitory role of caveolin- 1 on HO-BKCa complexes. Membrane potential recordings and isolated arteriole experiments further demonstrated EC BKCa regulates EC Em and vasoconstrictor reactivity following CH through a loss in caveolin- 1 inhibition. This study is the first to characterize HO-dependent BKCa activation regulation by caveolin- 1 and demonstrate a functional role for endothelial BKCa in vascular tone.

40|$|Abstract Background Indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) is an {{immunomodulatory}} molecule {{that has}} been implicated in several biological processes. Although IDO has been linked with some renal diseases, its role in renal fibrosis is still unclear. Because IDO may be modulated by TGF-β 1, a potent fibrogenic molecule, we hypothesized that IDO could be involved in renal fibrosis, especially acting in the TGF-β 1 -induced tubular epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We analyzed the IDO expression and activity in a model of renal fibrogenesis, {{and the effect of}} the IDO inhibitor 1 -methyl-tryptophan (MT) on TGF-β 1 -induced EMT using tubular cell culture. Methods Male Wistar rats where submited to 7  days of UUO. Non-obstructed kidneys (CL) and kidneys from SHAM rats were used as controls. Masson’s Tricrome and macrophages counting were used to chatacterize the tissue fibrosis. The EMT was analysed though immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. Immunohistochemestry in tissue has used to show IDO expression. MDCK cells were incubated with TGF- β 1 to analyse IDO expression. Additionally, effects of TGF- β 1 and the inhibition of IDO over the EMT process was <b>acessed</b> by immunoessays and scrath wound essay. Results IDO was markedly expressed in cortical and medular tubules of the UUO kidneys. Similarly to the immunolocalizaton of TGF- β 1, accompanied by loss of e-cadherin expression and an increase of mesenchymal markers. Results in vitro with MDCK cells, showed that IDO was increased after stimulus with TGF-β 1, and treatment with MT potentiated its expression. MDCK stimulated with TGF-β 1 had higher migratory activity (scratch-wound assay), which was exacerbated by MT treatment. Conclusions IDO is constitutively expressed in tubular cells and increases during renal fibrogenesis. Although IDO is induced by TGF-β 1 in tubular cells, its chemical inhibitor acts as a profibrotic agent...|$|R

The occurrence and prevalence of Alternaria species causing leaf spots in brassica crops in Pernambuco was <b>acessed,</b> as well as the existence of a possible preference by vegetable host for these pathogens. Twenty-eight fields were surveyed in the Agreste region of Pernambuco state, in the 2005 and 2006 growing seasons. In each year, 10 Chinese cabbage, six cabbage, six cauliflower and six broccoli fields were visited. In each field, 50 leaves showing at least five lesions were randomly collected. Species identification was performed taking into account morphology of the conidia that was compared with literature data. Among the two Alternaria species found, A. brassicae was found in all Chinese cabbage fields while A. brassicicola was found in all fields of cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli. Overall, A. brassicicola was more prevalent than A. brassicae. In Chinese cabbage there was predominance of A. brassicae, with mean prevalence of 91. 0 % and 96. 5 % in 2005 and 2006. On the other hand, in broccoli and cabbage there was high predominance of A. brassicicola, with mean prevalence between 95. 1 % and 99. 8 %. In cauliflower, although the prevalence has been of A. brassicicola, high frequency of A. brassicae was noted. The frequency of co-occurrence of both Alternaria species was very low. The results of this study reinforce the hypothesis of existence of host preference within species of Alternaria that cause leaf spots in brassica crops, especially when Chinese cabbage, broccoli and cabbage are considered.

As medidas foram tomadas em folhas adultas, completamente expandidas, em duas situações de exposição à luminosidade: exposição solar plena e sombreamento natural. As variáveis analisadas foram: temperatura foliar (Tf), transpiração (E) e resistência difusiva (Rs). Verificou-se que as folhas sombreadas de M-UFRPE 2 transpiraram mais do que as expostas diretamente ao sol, diferindo do comportamento dos demais acessos. A Rs em folhas expostas ao sol variou de 1, 1 a 4, 5 s. cm- 1, enquanto que nas folhas sombreadas, essa variação foi de 1, 7 a 3, 5 s. cm- 1.

CONCLUSÃO: A descompressão orbital por via externa combinada com a via endonasal auxiliada por endoscopia mostrou-se eficaz na prevenção de sinusite clinicamente manifesta e suas complicações, embora no acompanhamento tomográfico 22 % dos pacientes apresentaram velamento do seio maxilar ou frontal. Many {{techniques}} of orbital decompression {{have been used}} in the treatment of Graves ophthalmopathy. Recently endonasal endoscope surgery was introduced in the orbital decompression, as an isolated technique, or combined with existing techniques hopefully to give better visualization of medial wall and a lower incidence infection when the medial wall is <b>acessed.</b> AIM: To evaluate orbital decompression combined with endoscope in prevention of bacterial infection, we relate three cases of assyntomatic patients with computer tomography control of facial sinus presenting opacification of maxillary or frontal sinus. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical Prospective. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 16 patients with 18 orbita procedures underwent orbital decompression, in the Ophthalmology Department at the Escola Paulista de Medicina-UNIFESP an orbital decompression was obtained by combined technique using endonasal access with an endoscope. RESULTS: Four patients during postoperative CT scan presented assymtomatic opacification of the maxillary or frontal sinuses. CONCLUSION: A combination of endoscopy in orbital decompression by external approach showed the effectiveness in prevention of sinusitis clinically manifested and its complications, although a longer time of follow-up is needed to understand better radiological findings 22 % presented opacification of the sinuses and their consequences...|$|R
