5|$|Cheddar is a gorge {{lying on}} the {{southern}} edge of the Mendip Hills. The maximum depth of the gorge is , with a near-vertical cliff-face to the south, and steep grassy slopes to the north. The B3135 road runs <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the gorge.|$|E
5|$|Some species {{differ in}} form from the typical octopus body shape. Members of the {{suborder}} Cirrina have stout gelatinous bodies with webbing that reaches near {{the tip of}} their arms, and two large fins above the eyes, supported by an internal shell. Fleshy papillae or cirri are found <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the arms, and the eyes are more developed.|$|E
5000|$|In geography, a plain is a flat, {{sweeping}} landmass {{that generally}} {{does not change}} much in elevation. Plains occur as lowlands <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of valleys or on the doorsteps of mountains, as coastal plains, and as plateaus or uplands.|$|R

The two inner wing hardpoints could carry pods of three TOW anti-tank missiles. 2.75-inch (70mm) rockets in 7-rocket or 19-rocket launchers could be carried on the four wing hardpoints. The two fuselage mounts were dedicated to carrying external fuel tanks. The wing hardpoints were also plumbed to allow the carriage of additional fuel tanks if required.|$|E
5|$|Starting in July 2000, the Senators reused the {{alternate}} logo on another third jersey, designed by Ottawa firm Hoselton Brunet, this one black {{with red and}} gold sleeves and a gold stripe with laurel leaves <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the jersey. On the shoulders, was {{a modified version of}} the original Peace Tower logo of the expansion campaign, which the management liked. Like the original logo, this design was leaked onto the Internet. This jersey was in use until the end of the 2006–07 season.|$|E
5|$|The more major of {{the current}} roads often started as turnpikes in the 16th century. These avoid the highest areas of the hills. To {{the north of the}} western part of the Mendips, the A368 {{separates}} the hills from the Chew Valley, while on the southern edge the A371 similarly runs <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the scarp slope between the hills and the Somerset Levels. The western end of the hills is crossed by the M5 motorway and A38. Further east, and running almost north to south, are the A37 and A39.|$|E

50|$|The Mountain Lakes Wilderness is a {{wilderness}} area {{located in the}} Fremont-Winema National Forest in the southern Cascade Range of Oregon in the United States. It surrounds a cluster of four overlapping shield volcanoes, the highest of which is 8208 ft Aspen Butte. Over 20 small lakes lie <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of several large cirques carved by Ice Age glaciers near the summits of the volcanoes.|$|R
5|$|Like all flounders, Peacock flounders, Bothus mancus, have {{excellent}} adaptive camouflage. They use cryptic coloration {{to avoid being}} detected by both prey and predators. Whenever possible rather than swim, they crawl on their fins <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> while constantly changing colours and patterns to match their background. In a study, some flounders demonstrated the ability to change pattern in eight seconds. They were able to match the pattern of checkerboards that they were placed on. Changing pattern is an extremely complex process involving the flounder's vision and hormones. If one of the fish's eyes is damaged, or covered by the sand, the flounder has difficulties in matching its pattern to its surroundings. Whenever the fish is hunting or hiding from predators, it buries itself into the sand, leaving only the eyes protruding.|$|E
5|$|Most Tales {{games have}} skits, side conversations between {{different}} characters {{that can be}} both dramatic and comedic in nature. They are commonly portrayed as character portraits or profiles, with text <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the screen. They were first introduced in Tales of Destiny, though the majority were cut from the English release. In the original English GameCube release of Symphonia, the voice track for the skits was removed, but for its HD re-release, the Japanese voice track, and consequently the skit voice tracks, were included. The first English release to include fully voiced skits was Vesperia: they had been planned for Abyss, but were cut due to space issues. Another recurring feature is the Cooking system, where characters learn and prepare dishes to restore health and forms of experience points.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus coexisted {{with fellow}} large theropods Ceratosaurus and Torvosaurus {{in both the}} United States and Portugal. The three appear to have had {{different}} ecological niches, based on anatomy {{and the location of}} fossils. Ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may have preferred to be active around waterways, and had lower, thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas allosaurs were more compact, with longer legs, faster but less maneuverable, and seem to have preferred dry floodplains. Ceratosaurus, better known than Torvosaurus, differed noticeably from Allosaurus in functional anatomy by having a taller, narrower skull with large, broad teeth. Allosaurus was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an Allosaurus pubic foot marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably Ceratosaurus or Torvosaurus. The location of the bone in the body (<b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs), {{and the fact that it}} was among the most massive in the skeleton, indicates that the Allosaurus was being scavenged.|$|E

5|$|There {{are still}} several {{quarries}} on the Mendip Hills. Some {{of the stone}} is still carried by Mendip Rail; the other railways in the area closed in the 1960s. Although the Roman Fosse Way crossed the hills, the main roads generally avoid the higher areas and run <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the scarp slope on {{the north and south}} of the hills. The western end of the hills is crossed by the M5 motorway and A38. Further east, and running almost north to south, are the A37 and A39. A wide range of outdoor sports and leisure activities take place in the Mendips, many based on the particular geology of the area. The hills are recognised as a national centre for caving and cave diving, as well as being popular with climbers, hillwalkers and natural historians. Wookey Hole Caves and some of the caves in Cheddar Gorge are open as show caves; however, many of the caves of the Mendip Hills are only accessible to members of caving clubs. Long distance footpaths include the Mendip Way and Limestone Link.|$|E
5|$|Within Shepton Mallet {{there are}} several {{distinct}} areas which originated as separate communities around the central point {{of the church and}} Market Place. The town centre is small, basically consisting of two streets: High Street, which runs south from the Market Place towards the Townsend Retail Park, and the pedestrianised Town Street which runs north from the Market Place to Waterloo Bridge. To the east, separated from the Market Place by the Academy complex, is the parish church of St Peter and St Paul. Lower Lane, which runs under Waterloo Bridge <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the river valley {{to the north of the}} town centre, is one of the few parts of the town where the River Sheppey runs above ground. At the eastern end is Leg Square, which is surrounded by three large houses originally built by owners of some of the town's mills. Very close by is Cornhill, on which the former prison stands.|$|E
5|$|The river {{flows through}} the South Downs, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and since 2011, a {{designated}} national park. There are two large aquifers in the area, one consisting of chalk, {{to the south of}} the river valley, and the other the Lower Greensand Group, underlying the whole of the river. The aquifers are separated by a Gault Formation, which consists of clay. At {{the western edge of the}} region, both the chalk and the gault turn to the north, creating a scarp slope. The base flow of the river consists of water from the Lower Greensand aquifer, and from springs <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the chalk scarp slope. These help to maintain the flows in the river during the summer months, although there have been significant periods where flows have been low, notably in the drought of the early 1990s, and again in 1995/96. These led to declines in the populations of the macro-invertebrates which are used to measure the health of a river, but these have subsequently recovered. In order to monitor the hydrology, the Environment Agency has a series of observation boreholes along the valley, and maintains gauging stations at Princes Marsh, close to the source, at Iping Mill, at Halfway Bridge on the River Lod just above its junction with the Rother, and at Hardham, just before the river joins the Arun.|$|E
