5|$|According to Malhotra, most of {{the action}} stunts in the film were shot by Roshan and Dutt themselves, while body doubles were used to film a few scenes.

50|$|There are {{two factors}} which {{contribute}} to the development of either <b>an</b> <b>elaborated</b> or restricted code within a system. They are: the nature of the socialising agencies (family, peer group, school, work) present in a system as well as the values within the system. When the socialising agencies are well defined and structured you find a restricted code. Conversely, where the agencies are malleable, <b>an</b> <b>elaborated</b> code is found. In a society which values individuality you find elaborated codes, and in a narrower society you find restricted codes (Littlejohn, 2002). According to Bernstein (1971), “The orientation towards these codes may be governed entirely by the form of the social relation, or more generally by the quality of the social structure” (p. 135).|$|R
