5|$|Although gallium has {{no natural}} {{function}} in biology, gallium ions interact with {{processes in the}} body in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> iron(III). Because these processes include inflammation, a marker for many disease states, several gallium salts are used (or are in development) as pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine. When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as Pseudomonas, the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.|$|E

5|$|Anecdotally {{injection}} of alprazolam has been reported, causing dangerous damage to blood vessels, closure {{of blood vessels}} (embolization) and decay of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). Alprazolam is not very soluble in water—when crushed in water it does not fully dissolve (40µg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There have also been anecdotal reports of alprazolam being snorted. Due to the low weight of a dose, alprazolam, in one case, was distributed on blotter paper in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> LSD.|$|E

Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E

Indeed, erect-limbs may be omnipresent in pterosaurs.|$|E
