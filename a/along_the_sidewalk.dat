The strip was used again in 2016 for the filming of Red Hot Chili Peppers - Go Robot music video.|$|E

In March 2013 three dozen herbs were planted: rosemary, oregano, thyme. All planted <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> and curbsides of Chosewood, available to everyone to take a snip for cooking.

25|$|A {{number of}} federal, county, and private {{hospitals}} suffered {{varying degrees of}} damage, with four major facilities in the San Fernando Valley experiencing structural damage, and two of those experiencing collapse. The Indian Hills Medical Center, Foothill Medical Building, and the Pacoima Lutheran Professional building were all heavily damaged, but nursing homes were also affected. One facility in particular, the one-story Foothill Nursing Home, sat very close to {{a section of the}} fault that broke the surface and was raised up three feet relative to the street. Scarps ran <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> and across the property, but the building was not in use at the time, and remained standing. Though the reinforced concrete block structure was afflicted by the shock and uplift, the relatively good performance was {{in stark contrast to the}} Olive View and Veterans Hospital complexes.|$|E

Magnani's life was struck by tragedy when Luca came down with crippling polio at only 18 months of age. He never regained use of his legs.

2500|$|There were {{numerous}} famous watering {{holes in the}} area contributing to the nightlife, including the Corner Grocery Bar, Toad Hall, the Pendulum, the Midnight Sun, Twin Peaks, and the Elephant Walk. A typical daytime street scene of the period is perhaps best illustrated by mentioning the male belly dancers who could be found holding forth in good weather {{at the corner of}} 18th and Castro on [...] "Hibernia Beach", in front of the financial institution from which it drew its name. Then at night, after the bars closed at 2 AM, the men remaining at that hour often would line up <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> of 18th Street to indicate that they were still available to go home with someone (aka The Meat Rack).|$|E

2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E
