5|$|Keith {{finds out}} that Selma might have {{disappeared}} {{to get away from}} her husband. Veronica shows Wallace the Roman numerals, and they deduce that it is a date, and Veronica learns that a sorority house member died on that day. Veronica confronts a sorority girl <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> member, and she implies that others believe that something happened to her. After finding out that leaving her husband after ten years would be beneficial to Selma, Veronica and Keith break into the Roses’ house and find Selma on the couch. Selma tells the pair why she has “disappeared”: Mr. Rose is trying to scam her for more money and has blackmailed her with knowledge of a lesbian affair with her dog walker.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to intense {{public interest in}} Australia during the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Tamam Shud case also attracted international attention. South Australian Police consulted their counterparts overseas and distributed information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> man internationally, {{in an effort to}} identify him. International circulation of a photograph of the man and details of his fingerprints yielded no positive identification. For example, in the United States, the FBI was unable to match the dead man's fingerprint with prints taken from files of domestic criminals. Scotland Yard was also asked to assist with the case, but could not offer any insights.|$|E
25|$|Press reports <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> {{were often}} confused. For example, the Washington Post {{reported}} that the body of engineer Darwin Merritt had been found on February 16, but this was incorrect. The newspaper also incorrectly {{reported that the}} body of Lieutenant Friend W. Jenkins was recovered on February 16. In fact, Jenkins' body was retrieved from an area near the aft torpedo tube on March 24. It was sent home to his family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The newspapers often got names wrong, reporting that an Edison or Tennis was among the dead (when no persons with those first or last names were among the crew).|$|E

25|$|The longstanding estate {{battle of}} Jarndyce v Jarndyce {{hangs over the}} heads of many {{conflicting}} heirs, confused by multiple wills. Possible beneficiary John Jarndyce of Bleak House welcomes orphaned cousins Ada Clare and Richard Carstone — also potential heirs — as his wards, and has hired Esther Summerson as a housekeeper and companion for Ada. Lady Honoria Dedlock, married to the imperious baronet Sir Leicester, is also a possible beneficiary of the estate. The Dedlocks' lawyer, Tulkinghorn, sniffs out a connection between Lady Dedlock and a newly deceased man called Nemo; as he tries to discover Nemo's true identity, Lady Dedlock secretly seeks information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> man herself. Meanwhile, Richard and Ada are falling in love. Richard keeps changing his mind on which career to pursue — first a physician, then a lawyer and then a soldier — but the prospect of his inheritance from the ongoing litigation begins to consume him, despite warnings from John, now his former guardian. Esther and the young doctor Allan Woodcourt are attracted to each other, but Esther feels unworthy and Allan accepts a commission as a navy physician.|$|E
500|$|The {{natural gas}} supplier, Litoral Gas, {{immediately}} began sealing the distribution pipe to the area. The Center for Ambulatory Medical Specialties of Rosario (...) managed the information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> and injured, and tents {{were prepared for}} those left homeless. Firefighters and other workers found people trapped on the upper floors of buildings and evacuated them over adjacent roofs. Although the building was not destroyed by the explosion, {{a high risk of}} structural failure remained.|$|E
500|$|However, {{later that}} month Bulgarian environmentalists {{stated that the}} bat {{population}} in the cave had been reduced by up to 75% (from about 30,000 in 2010 to 8,000 in 2011). Nikolay Simov of the Center for Bat Studies and Protection at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences blamed The Expendables 2s production for the reduction. On January 16, 2012, the Veliko Tarnovo Appellate Prosecutor's Office overturned a ruling by its Lovech equivalent to prevent an investigation of what environmentalists stated to be an [...] "excessive" [...] number of dead bats found in the cave after filming (including several endangered species). The European Commission became involved, contacting the Bulgarian Ministry of Environment and Waters for information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> bats; the Bulgarian Ministry and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences conducted their own probe, stating that the bat kill was within normal parameters. The Veliko Tarnovo Appellate stated that the Lovech Environmental Ministry failed to investigate violations made by The Expendables 2s crew. On February 23, 2012, a Bulgarian {{court ruled that the}} crew had violated its filming license.|$|E

500|$|Parts of Giselle {{have been}} cut or changed since the ballet's first night. Giselle's Act I {{pantomime}} scene in which she tells Albrecht of her strange dream is cut and the peasant pas de deux is also slightly cut back. The Duke of Courland and his daughter Bathilde used to make their entrance on horseback, but today they walk on. In the original production they were present at Giselle's death, but now they leave the scene before she dies. The machines used to make Giselle fly and to make her disappear are no longer employed. A trapdoor is sometimes utilized to make Giselle rise from her grave and then sink into {{it at the end}} of Act II. At the end of Act II Bathilde formerly entered with the courtiers to search for Albrecht. He took a few unsteady steps toward them and then collapsed into their arms. This moment was an artistic parallel to the Act I finale when the peasants gathered <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> Giselle. [...] Now, Bathilde and the courtiers are cut and Albrecht slowly leaves the stage alone.|$|E
500|$|Cagney starred as Rocky Sullivan, {{a gangster}} {{fresh out of}} jail and looking for his former associate, played by Humphrey Bogart, who owes him money. While revisiting his old haunts, he runs into his old friend Jerry Connolly, played by O'Brien, {{who is now a}} priest {{concerned}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> End Kids' futures, particularly as they idolize Rocky. After a messy shootout, Sullivan is eventually captured by the police and sentenced to death in the electric chair. Connolly pleads with Rocky to [...] "turn yellow" [...] {{on his way to the}} chair so the Kids will lose their admiration for him, and hopefully avoid turning to crime. Sullivan refuses, but on his way to his execution, he breaks down and begs for his life. It is unclear whether this cowardice is real or just feigned for the Kids' benefit. Cagney himself refused to say, insisting he liked the ambiguity. The film is regarded by many as one of Cagney's finest, and garnered him an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination for 1938. He lost to Spencer Tracy in Boys Town. Cagney had been considered for the role, but lost out on it due to his typecasting. (He also lost the role of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne in Knute Rockne, All American to his friend Pat O'Brien for the same reason.) Cagney did, however, win that year's New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor.|$|E
500|$|O'Mahoney and Winter {{began working}} on the film in 2006. Winter had watched a film called The Women's Story, about two Iraqi women who had journeyed {{around the country and}} filmed what they saw. They wanted to make a {{documentary}} about [...] "the people never seen on the evening news, [...] presidents, prime ministers, generals and militants ... claiming to know something of Iraq's future". Winter explained that [...] "all these documentaries coming out of Iraq were done for or by adults. Iraqi children had not been more than a UN statistic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead,</b> kidnapped or injured", so they decided to concentrate on what they viewed as the [...] "real source of Iraq's future" [...] – teenagers. [...] "I wanted {{to tell the story of}} Iraq in a different way. As journalists, we do stories about kids and teenagers, but we don't hear from them. If you go to the UN reports, they are just a number and that's it." [...] O'Mahoney was a little more reticent; he had recently worked in Iraq but did not wish to return due to the civil war and the deteriorating condition of the country. When it was decided to use a school as a backdrop to the story, which could also be used to provide a chronological narrative, O'Mahoney and Winter realised it would be too dangerous for the students to be seen with either a Western or Iraqi camera crew because it would draw too much attention to them, and so they decided that the students would film the documentary themselves.|$|E

2500|$|The Foreign Press Association, which {{represents}} hundreds of journalists in Israel and the Palestinian territories, complained that Israel is validating its own account by selectively using the seized video and equipment from reporters on board. FPA also criticized Israel's use of captured material without permission. Journalist Paul McGeough told his consul-general [...] "we were robbed of any electronic equipment that we had" [...] and [...] "Fairfax will fight this ... I could {{be back in}} Israel within two weeks to contest this." [...] Israeli public radio reported that authorities had banned the media from providing any information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> and wounded, and who was taken to hospital in Israel. The censorship order was later lifted.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Hiyya the Elder met a Babylonian in the Land of Israel {{and asked}} him about the welfare of Rabbi Hiyya's father in Babylon. The Babylonian replied that Rabbi Hiyya's mother in Babylon had asked about Rabbi Hiyya. Rabbi Hiyya exclaimed that he asked one thing and the Babylonian spoke to him of another. The Babylonian replied that people ask about the living, but not <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> (hinting that Rabbi Hiyya's father had died). The Midrash thus read Joseph's question, [...] "Is your father well?" [...] in [...] to allude to Jacob, and Joseph's {{reference}} in [...] to [...] "the old man of whom you spoke" [...] to allude to Isaac.
