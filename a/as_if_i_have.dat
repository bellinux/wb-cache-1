He was the squadron's top scorer with the Triplane, mostly in one particular airframe, N5493, that he christened [...] "Blymp", which also became the nickname of his baby son.

40|$|The purpose {{behind the}} writing {{of this paper was}} twofold. Not only did I write it to {{complete}} my requirements and graduate on the donors Program, but also I chose the topic of minimal competency testing because it is a concept that I will most likely come into contact with as a teacher in the next few years. I did not attempt to take a stand on the issue, but instead simply wrote as objectively as possible-in covering the topic. Since most school systems in Indiana have not yet been exposed to competency testing, my research was derived mostly from materials dealing with other states and articles written by those who have studied the concept in great detail. Having done the project, I feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a much greater understanding of the most controversial issue in education in the year 1979. I would also like to extend a hearty thanks to Dr. Paul Schumacher of the English Department at Ball State University for acting as my advisor for my thesis. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|E
40|$|Once again I {{stand at}} the gate that is ajar. Now that my life has {{followed}} {{the course of the}} winding arabesque, I find myself once more at the place where I started. ” (Shammas, 1988, p. 226) In Arabesque Shammas (1988) finds himself back to the place where his journey began. His biographical narrative tells of his travels and the people he meets along the way. The pattern of the Islamic arabesque, with its winding vines and foliage motif is, I believe, symbolic of the intricacies of life and for me, the intricacies of research. I feel that my life is still following “the course of the winding arabesque ” and often I feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not gone very far from “the place where I started ” (Shammas, 1988, p. 226), though in reality I have grown through the process of researching and studying. Part of being a qualitative researcher {{is that there is no}} straight path, there are twists and turns and sometimes these pathways can lead into areas that are dark and unwelcoming, or not clearly visible.

40|$|Our own {{and alien}} in the contextof the Estonian history of thoughtIn order to {{introduce}} the wider context of the article, the author firstlyrefers back to his text Uitamisi Eesti mõtteloos (Wanderings in theEstonian history of thought) that {{was published in the}} 2014 collectionRahvusvahelised rahvusteadused (International ethno-nationalsciences). The dilemma of our own and alien that arose quite early inthe Estonian history of thought can be noted already in the title ofthe essay collection Omad ja võõrad (1927) (Our own and alien) byBernhard Linde; a possible solution to the issue was also offered inthe collection. In 1921 when Eino Leino first visited Estonia, he said“It seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> arrived home. ” The alien is our own. The authordescribes an aspect of his personal “history”—he approached thisproblem in a new context and found quite the opposite solution whenhe wrote under the pen name of I. Ronicus. On the basis of the ExplanatoryDictionary of Written Estonian, which includes material bothfrom spoken language and literature in its widest sense, the authorwill analyse and explore the issue of belonging and being alien alsofrom the philosophical perspective, first and foremost phenomenologicallyaccording to E. Husserl’s views. The author also analyses the dilemma of our own and alien in thecontext of the book series History of Estonian Thought in the form ofseveral sub-dilemmas. For example, the series features several authorswho could be considered alien in the conventional meaning—i. e.,they were not Estonian or did not speak Estonian or at least did notwrite all works that are included in the volumes of the series or a largepart of them in Estonian. If one claims that even though all authorsare one’s own in the solipsistic sense of E. Husserl’s transcendentalphenomenology, the emerging question is rather how we approachthe relationship of our own and alien {{from the perspective of the}} listthat was mentioned before. The external practical and pragmatic solutionis that all authors and their works have a “biographical” connectionto Estonia. Through this, they belong to our Estonian world,albeit some have stronger and some weaker connections to it. The“internal”, essential problem related to some authors not mentionedhere is, however, more complicated. The author offers a solution tothis as well based on the example of the conflict between Jaan Tõnissonand Ado Grenzstein—according to him, both undoubtedly belongedto the historical discourse of the Estonian history of thought...|$|E
