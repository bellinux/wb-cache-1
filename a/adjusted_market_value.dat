We find that governments do not relinquish control after “privatization. ” We show that the market-to-book ratios of privatized firms converge through time to those of a control sample. However, this convergence does not depend on whether governments relinquish their control rights.

Since then tax system has been in a steady process of evolution, modification and change. In recent years one of the most heavily discussed and politically sensitive issues in Hungary is the introduction of a value-based property tax. The paper deals first the experiences with levying taxes related to properties. Local authorities are responsible for rising, administering and collecting municipal taxes. At statutory level, the parliament only regulates the general framework of local taxes. The most important feature of the Hungarian local tax system is the absence of the compulsory tax. The other special feature of the Hungarian local tax system is the predominant share of the local business tax, which is basically a sales tax. There are several local taxes related to properties, but only a few municipalities apply the <b>adjusted</b> <b>market</b> <b>value</b> as the base for building or land parcel tax. The paper also deals with the debate arguing for and against a mandatory value-based property tax. A variety of expectations by introducing the new system are analyzed in the concluding part.

40|$|Banking {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{regulated}} industries in the world. One major part of the regulation is the capital adequacy regulation which restricts the minimum level of capital banks are required to hold. The best known capital adequacy regulator is the Basel committee on banking supervision which is responsible for the regulation regimes known as Basel I, Basel II and Basel III. Study by Vallascas and Hadendorff (2013) prove that the updated capital ratios in Basel II can explain better the true risk banks face. Due to improved qualities, the ratios should be more useful for investors to be used for market valuation of banks. However, only few researches have been conducted about the market valuation of banks and it is still undiscovered how the changes in capital adequacy ratios affect the valuation. This thesis examines the theoretical and practical value relevance of capital adequacy ratios before and after the Basel II implementation in European banks. By value relevance this thesis means the capability to explain the level of market value, not changes in it. This thesis is unique in multiple ways. European banking sector is not widely covered as most of the studies use U. S. data. Also most of the banking valuation models use unweighted capital ratios instead of risk-weighted regulatory ratios and the studies show mixed results on the effect of capital to banks’ Market-to-Book value. Although the changes in regulation have been studied in multiple ways, the value relevance of improved regulation has not been covered. Data for the research is collected from multiple sources and the final data consist of 448 bank-year observations from 41 banks within years 2002 and 2015. In order to compare the effect of the regulatory changes the data is divided into two subsamples, the prior including observations from 2002 to 2004 and the later from 2010 to 2012. Four different methods are used to evaluate the 5 attributes of value relevant performance measure during both subsample periods. The five attributes evaluated are Persistence, Predictability, Predictability of future cash flow, Substitute for cash flow and Timeliness. The models are adjusted from the methods used by Barton et al. (2010) to suit better the capital adequacy measures. Again, four different methods are used to evaluate the practical value relevance of capital adequacy ratios from which three are modifications from the model created by Calomiris and Nissim (2014). Dependent variable is the three month-forward <b>Adjusted</b> <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of equity divided by Common equity. The results show that three from the five theoretical value relevance attributes have improved after the regulatory changes. The conclusion is that theoretical value relevance of Tier 1 Capital ratio has improved. The practical value relevance however does not show similar improvements. The correlation between Tier 1 Capital ratio and Adjusted Market-to-Book ratio has increased but the explanatory power of capital adequacy ratios shows no improvements. Also the effect of capital adequacy ratios to Adjusted Market-to-Book ratio has become lower – even negative – and statistically insignificant. Thus, the results show clear controversy between the theoretical and practical value relevance of capital adequacy ratios...|$|E

On the other hand, there are considerable differences between other variables depending on the model.

30|$|Fourthly, banks {{commonly}} apply a flat haircut to {{the collateral}} value. For collateral in real estate, this haircut ranges between 10 and 40  % in Germany (see, e.g., Grunert and Weber 2009; Bruhn 2009; Pfnür 2011). Hence, we apply flat haircuts to the collateral values {{to adjust the}} collateralization ratios and explain the recovery rate again. In comparison to the flat haircuts, we use predicted proceeds ratios to <b>adjust</b> the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of real estate. We thereby obtain an adjusted collateralization ratio that {{can also be used}} to explain the recovery rate. Both adjustments of the collateralization ratios considerably increase the explanatory power of the original model, whereas the haircut models perform worse in terms of explanatory power in comparison to the models using model-adjusted collateralization ratios.|$|R

The presented changes in the new exposure draft include capitalizing all leases, which will affect companies’ financial ratios. These regulation changes may affect the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> for affected companies. PURPOSE The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe and explore the effects and possible consequences capitalizing operating leases has on <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of equity. We want to investigate if investors already adjust for capitalized operating leases in their assessment of <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of equity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD Our purpose and hypothesis is investigated by capitalizing operating leases. All data is collected from DataStream and processed using a constructive capitalization model. The capitalized data is then tested against our hypothesis using a regression model.

30|$|In a next step, {{we use the}} {{predicted}} proceeds ratio to <b>adjust</b> the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of real estate. We thereby obtain an adjusted collateralization ratio and then create additional adjusted collateralization ratios by applying, in accordance with common banking practice, flat haircuts of 20 and 30  % to the collateral in real estate. The new analysis of the recovery rate provides several new insights. First, the models’ explanatory power can be increased by adjusting by the recognized biases and using the adjusted collateralization ratio. This is confirmed by a (partially) out-of-sample test. Therefore, we can conclude that our models that use the correction parameter outperform the unadjusted models and the flat haircut models. Second, some of the control variables for retail customers lose their previously significant influence. The combined analysis at the borrower and collateral levels should, therefore, be {{a crucial part of}} the analysis of factors influencing the recovery rate in future empirical studies.|$|R

There are many works that try to identify these factors. Some of them are focused on variables to make a set complete and others are on models and methods. The aim {{of this article is}} to present the variables influencing the valuation and to build an econometric model valuing footballers playing on the forward position, taking into consideration the assumptions of the econometric modelling. Such an approach indicates managers as other sources for obtaining information. Methodology: Econometric models were used to verify the hypothesis formulated in this research. The database was created on the basis of variables presented on the website www. transfermarkt. de that presents the values of the most valuable football players in the world playing on the forward position. The Gretl program was used in the research. Findings: The literature review showed that there are many independent variables having an impact on the value of the player. There are also many different models used to valuate footballers’ performance rights. The results of estimation of models in the research indicated that such factors as Canadian classification points <b>adjusted</b> the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of the team and dummy variables describing “goodwill” (only for the best players) had an impact on the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of footballers’ performance rights.

For instance, when Georgia O'Keeffe died she had over 400 of her own works in her estate, and when Andy Warhol died he had over 90,000 works, including 4,100 paintings, 9,000 drawings, 19,000 prints and 63,000 photographs. In Georgia O'Keeffe's case, her estate's appraisers established blockage discounts based on solid evidence of market sales, but the IRS used its own valuation and the Tax Court assessed a resulting tax of more than the valuation of the collected works at her death. In Andy Warhol's case Surrogate Court of New York rejected the proposed discounts of Christe's, which averaged 60%. Instead, the court applied an average discount of 25%. The court failed to articulate the specific rationale for its determination, but did state that Warhol was more famous than Smith & O'Keeffe. The court's application of an average discount of 25% has been criticized by attorneys and appraisers because, inter alia, it ignored the necessary time {{it would take to}} sell 90,000 pieces of art.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to empirically examine the effect on {{ownership}} tenure for residential housing under an acquisition-based property tax system. The state of Florida has an acquisition-based property tax system whereby annual assessments are capped to protect existing homeowners; the assessment is only <b>adjusted</b> to reflect <b>market</b> <b>value</b> upon resale. We hypothesize that such a system would lengthen the average tenure of residential home ownership, since the transactions costs of intra-state moves are magnified by the lost property subsidy. A sample of 20 Florida counties is used to examine average and median residential housing tenure at two distinct points in time to investigate changes in housing tenure. The results do not support the hypothesis. Possible mitigating factors included increased residential housing demand from a large population influx, escalating residential property values, low interest rates and easy credit availability, and homeowners adjusting to the acquisition-based property tax system. Differing methods of property tax assessment may impact the transaction costs of relocation and the average length of tenure associated with home ownership. Curren...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to test empirically the extent to which {{differences}} in property taxes are capitalized in the market prices of industrial real estate. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is a multiple regression study of the selling prices of 419 industrial properties near O’Hare airport in metropolitan Chicago that were sold during 2001 - 2004. The paper also includes a theoretical analysis of the relationship between the property tax rate on industrial property and the tax revenue that is collected. Findings – The results show that selling price per square foot is a function of property characteristics as expected, and suggest that the property tax differential between Cook County and DuPage County is fully capitalized. The property tax differential was 2. 63 per cent of <b>market</b> <b>value,</b> and comparable properties sold for 16. 2 per cent less in Cook County than in adjacent DuPage County. The theoretical analysis shows that the revenue-maximizing property tax rate in the long run depends upon the capitalization rate, the elasticity of demand for industrial real estate, and the elasticity of supply of industrial real estate. Research limitations/implications – The data pertain only to the area near O’Hare airport for the years 2001 - 2004. Additional empirical tests are needed in other places and for other time periods. Also, the impact of public services on the value of industrial property needs to be investigated. Practical implications – Appraisers of industrial real estate should <b>adjust</b> estimates of <b>market</b> <b>value</b> for differences in property taxes. Buyers and sellers of industrial real estate should also be cognizant of the effect of property taxes on <b>market</b> <b>value.</b> Local public officials should be aware of the possibility that a relatively high tax rate on industrial property can cause tax revenue collected to be less than the maximum amount that is possible. Originality/value – This is the first empirical study of industrial property values that includes the effect of variations in the property tax.

These values must be <b>adjusted</b> to fair <b>market</b> <b>value</b> wherever possible.The value of a company's intangible assets, such as goodwill, is generally impossible to determine apart from the company's overall enterprise value.

In these cases, the asset-based approach yields a result that is probably lesser than the fair <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of the business.In considering an asset-based approach, the valuation professional must consider whether the shareholder whose interest is being valued would have any authority to access the value of the assets directly. Shareholders own shares in a corporation, but not its assets, which are owned by the corporation. A controlling shareholder may have the authority to direct the corporation to sell {{all or part of the}} assets it owns and to distribute the proceeds to the shareholder(s). The non-controlling shareholder, however, lacks this authority and cannot access the value of the assets. As a result, the value of a corporation's assets is not the true indicator of value to a shareholder who cannot avail himself of that value.
