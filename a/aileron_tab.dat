40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the aileron investigation and includes rolling-moment, yawing-moment, and aileron hinge-moment coefficients and pressure coefficients across the aileron-balance seal through a range of angle of attack, <b>tab</b> deflection, and <b>aileron</b> deflection with flaps neutral and deflected 20 degrees and 55 degrees. Some of the effects of wing roughness and balance seal leakage on the <b>aileron</b> and <b>tab</b> characteristics are also presented...|$|R
25|$|Some {{versions}} of the G-6 and later Gs had a taller, wood-structure tail unit and redesigned rudder which improved stability at high speeds. The introduction of the WGr. 21cm (8in) under-wing mortar/rockets and the 30mm (1.18in) MK 108 cannon increased firepower. Certain production batches of the Bf 109G were fitted with <b>aileron</b> Flettner <b>tabs</b> to decrease stick forces at high speeds. A radio-navigational method, the Y-Verführung (Y-Guidance) was introduced with the FuG 16ZY.|$|R

Stick forces were estimated for several aileron arrangements including an arrangement recommended for the airplane. Flight tests of the recommended arrangement are discussed briefly in an appendix, The results of the wind-tunnel and flight tests indicate that the ailerons of large or fast airplanes may be satisfactorily balanced by the method developed...|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{considered}} {{as the most}} effective variant, the Model 52 was developed to again shorten the wings to increase speed and dispense with the folding wing mechanism. In addition, <b>ailerons,</b> <b>aileron</b> trim <b>tab</b> and flaps were revised. Produced first by Mitsubishi, most Model 52s were made by Nakajima. The prototype was made in June 1943 by modifying an A6M3 and was first flown in August 1943. The first Model 52 is said in the handling manual to have production number 3904, which apparently refers to the prototype.|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of applying wing tip extensions, winglets, and active control wing load alleviation to the Boeing 747 is investigated. Winglet aerodynamic design methods and high speed {{wind tunnel test}} results of winglets and of symmetrically deflected ailerons are presented. Structural resizing analyses to determine weight and aeroelastic twist increments for all the concepts and flutter model test results for the wing with winglets are included. Control law development, system mechanization/reliability studies, and <b>aileron</b> balance <b>tab</b> trade studies for active wing load alleviation systems are discussed.

40|$|Aerodynamics {{data are}} {{obtained}} {{for the design of}} linked balancing tabs and effect of varied tab span and location to produce suitable lateral control characteristics with reasonable stick pressures for high-speed aircraft. Simple and spring-linked balancing tabs may considerably reduce control pressures if aileron system is designed for low maximum <b>aileron</b> deflection. Spring-linked <b>tabs</b> also decrease variation of stick pressure with speed and impart better controlllability at low speeds...|$|R
50|$|NACA Report 736 {{presents}} theoretical expressions for {{the forces}} and the moments in a uniformhorizontal air stream on a plane airfoil performing small sinusoidal motions in several degrees of freedom: verticaI motion, torsional movement about an arbitrary spanwise axis, aileron movement about a hinge axis not necessarily located at the Ieading edge of the <b>aileron,</b> and <b>tab</b> movement similar to the aileron movement. The solution of this problem has direct application to the larger problem of flutter involving these various degrees of freedom and, in particular, to flutter of tails with control surfaces, including servocontrols. The development of the theory is analogous withthat of Report No. 496, which treats the case of three degreea of freedom: vertical motion, torsional movement about an arbitrary spanwise axis, and an aileron movement about a hinge axis located at the aileron's leading edge.|$|R
25|$|The wings were {{mid-mounted}} {{and strongly}} tapered with slightly swept leading edges and marked curvature on the trailing edges. They were fitted with <b>tabbed</b> <b>ailerons</b> and flaps. There were three crew, a bomb aimer/observer {{housed in a}} partially glazed nose, the pilot in a conventional cockpit which merged into a raised rear fuselage and, in the extreme tail just beyond the fins, a rear gunner in a turret. The NC.1070 had retractable tricycle gear, the nose leg slightly offset to port and each leg with a large single wheel.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{original}} intention during development {{had been to}} use as many Wirraway components as possible, the final design of the Boomerang had substantially differed from the source, having adopted shorter wings along with a shorter, wood-sheathed, aluminium-framed fuselage, which had increased strength in order to withstand combat stresses, and an original centre section. The low-mounted cantilever wing consisted of five sections, these being a central section, a pair of outer sections, and two detachable wing tips; the outer sections had a swept-back leading edge along with a straight trailing edge. The wing used a single spar and a stressed skin construction, along with fabric-covered <b>ailerons,</b> aluminium trim <b>tabs</b> and split trailing edge flaps. The main undercarriage hydraulically retracted into wheelwells forward of the main spar.|$|R
40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Kinematic chains or {{mechanisms}} have conventionally been analyzed comprising of links that behave as rigid members and links assumed to be built at nominal sizes. Such mechanisms, articulating entirely from rigid-body translations and/or rotations and nominally established links may not closely represent the actual real life manufactured parts with tolerances and joint clearances. It is important to identify the allowable variations in the linkages especially when the end-effector of the mechanism generates a path or a function and/or a tightly controlled gearing ratio or mechanical advantage is required. In this study, the band of solutions that {{can be obtained from}} the variation in lengths of linkages and the effect of stiffness is generated to better understand the quality of the mechanism performance. The application of four bar mechanism in an <b>aileron</b> trim <b>tab</b> system that utilizes a rotatory actuator to move the tab surface is used to demonstrate the band of solutions. Then CATIA VS is used to layout the geometry and design the linkages within the prescribed airfoil. The MSC Adams is used to calculate the initial gearing ratio and for validation of values. A Matlabgcode is developed and used to analyze the effects of the variation of lengths and stiffness of linkages on the tab speed using closed form algebraic solution. Finally, a comparison is made to illustrate and quantify the effects of link lengths and stiffness on the gearing ratio/mechanical advantage of the system...|$|R
25|$|The wings had {{constant}} chord with roughly elliptical tips, with roots joining the upper longerons. On each side, {{a pair of}} streamlined struts from {{the front and rear}} wing spars at mid-span transmitted lift loads {{to the end of the}} stub wing. There was another, slighter pair of struts from each engine mounting vertically to the wing. The wing structure was mostly metal, with some wooden components, then fabric covered. Each wing carried a pair of <b>ailerons</b> with trim <b>tabs</b> to reduce control loads. The fuselage was built around the usual four metal longerons and covered with an aluminium skin. Pilot and co-pilot sat side by side with dual control in an enclosed cabin just ahead of the leading edge, with fuselage windows on either side for lateral and downward vision. Access to the large passenger cabin, 4.60 m long, was via a radio compartment. The cabin seated ten passengers, five down each side with their own window. At the back were baggage spaces and toilet facilities. Passengers entered by a port-side door and luggage loaded through a door on the other side.|$|R

50|$|The FC.20 was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} reconnaissance bomber but was developed instead as a ground attack aircraft. The first prototype first flew in 1941, piloted by Moroni. Four variants were structurally and aerodynamically similar apart from the front fuselage detail and engine installations.The FC.20 was a cantilever low wing monoplane with a straight tapered wing of aspect ratio about 6.4. The leading edge was almost unswept and the tips rounded. The wing had positive dihedral outboard of the engines. The trailing edges carried short span, <b>tabbed</b> <b>ailerons</b> and split flaps which reached past the lower engine fairings to the wing roots. The twin engines were mounted forward of the leading edge with the propeller shaft in the wing plane; the mainwheels of the conventional undercarriage retracted backwards into the extended underwing engine fairings. The FC.20 had a twin tail, with elliptically shaped endplate vertical surfaces almost equally divided vertically between fin and rudder. These were mounted on a tapered tailplane with significant dihedral, carrying tabbed, tapered elevators. The rear fuselage extended beyond the empennage, providing a housing for the retractable talwheel.|$|R

50|$|The Il-62 is a {{conventional}} all-metal low-wing monoplane of riveted sectional semi-monocoque construction to fail-safe design principles (a structure {{designed so that}} failure of one major member does not cause immediate failure of the whole). Its service life was initially set at 30,000 flight hours and subject to extensions and curtailments according {{to the quality of}} service procedures, inspection and manufacturer's bulletins. The aircraft features pressurised cabin and freight holds (with fuselage dimensions of 3.8 m width x 4.1 m height), duplex all-mechanical flight controls, though with twin electric motors for tailplane incidence control; hydraulic nosewheel steering, landing gear and tail strut actuation, and wheel brakes. The Il-62M has spoilers and lift dumpers which extend automatically upon landing and are hydraulically operated. Control surfaces include a variable-incidence tailplane with dynamically and weight-compensated elevators with trim <b>tabs,</b> triple-section <b>tabbed</b> <b>ailerons</b> (outermost for low speed and innermost for high speed) which are interlinked with a torsion bar, spoilerons (Il-62M), spoilers and lift dumpers, and pneumatically actuated thrust reversers on the two outboard engines (the reversers are flight-rated on the Il-62M).|$|R
