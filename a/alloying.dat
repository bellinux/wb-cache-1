50|$|A superalloy, or {{high-performance}} <b>alloy,</b> is an <b>alloy</b> that exhibits {{several key}} characteristics: excellent mechanical strength, resistance to thermal creep deformation, good surface stability, {{and resistance to}} corrosion or oxidation. The crystal structure is typically face-centered cubic austenitic. Examples of such <b>alloys</b> are Hastelloy, Inconel, Waspaloy, Rene <b>alloys,</b> Haynes <b>alloys,</b> Incoloy, MP98T, TMS <b>alloys,</b> and CMSX single crystal <b>alloys.</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the fatigue {{behavior}} of removable partial denture <b>alloys</b> with and without heat treatment. Material Methods: A total of 35 specimens were casted and divided into 7 groups each 5 specimens for four different <b>alloy</b> groups. The <b>alloys</b> studied were low gold <b>alloy,</b> medium gold <b>alloy,</b> and palladium <b>alloy</b> and cobalt chromium <b>alloy</b> group. One way deflection fatigue test was used. The number of cycles required to fracture each specimen was recorded and subjected to statistical analysis [95 %confidence level]. Results: More number of cycles required to fracture the heat treated noble <b>alloys</b> and base metal <b>alloy</b> shows more fatigue resistance than low gold <b>alloy</b> but less than medium gold <b>alloy</b> and palladium <b>alloy.</b> Conclusion: Age hardening increases the fatigue resistance of noble <b>alloys</b> used for RPD. Clinical Implications: The mechanical property of cast restorations can be modified by heat treatment of the <b>alloys,</b> and can improve the longevity of the restoration...|$|R

5|$|The {{carbon content}} of steel is between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight for plain ironcarbon alloys. These values vary {{depending}} on <b>alloying</b> elements such as manganese, chromium, nickel, iron, tungsten, carbon and so on. Basically, steel is an iron-carbon alloy that does not undergo eutectic reaction. In contrast, cast iron does undergo eutectic reaction. Too little carbon content leaves (pure) iron quite soft, ductile, and weak. Carbon contents {{higher than those of}} steel make an alloy, commonly called pig iron, that is brittle (not malleable). While iron alloyed with carbon is called carbon steel, alloy steel is steel to which other <b>alloying</b> elements have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel. Common <b>alloying</b> elements include: manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, boron, titanium, vanadium, tungsten, cobalt, and niobium. Additional elements are also important in steel: phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, and traces of oxygen, nitrogen, and copper, that are most frequently considered undesirable.|$|E

5|$|Elemental bismuth is denser in {{the liquid}} phase than the solid, a {{characteristic}} it shares with germanium, silicon, gallium and water. Bismuth expands 3.32% on solidification; therefore, {{it was long}} a component of low-melting typesetting alloys, where it compensated for the contraction of the other <b>alloying</b> components, to form almost isostatic bismuth-lead eutectic alloys.|$|E
5|$|Metalloids are too brittle to {{have any}} {{structural}} uses in their pure forms. They and their compounds are used as (or in) <b>alloying</b> components, biological agents (toxicological, nutritional and medicinal), catalysts, flame retardants, glasses (oxide and metallic), optical storage media and optoelectronics, pyrotechnics, semiconductors and electronics.|$|E
5|$|Nonmetals do {{not have}} any {{universal}} or near-universal applications. This is not the case with metals, most of which have structural uses; nor the metalloids, the typical uses of which extend to (for example) oxide glasses, <b>alloying</b> components, and semiconductors.|$|E
40|$|Composition {{properties}} and morphology of Zn-Co <b>alloy</b> deposited from an alkaline sulphate bath have been investigated. A bath containing higher cobalt content produced an <b>alloy</b> with low cobalt content. The percentage of Co in the <b>alloy</b> decreased with increase in current density.

40|$|The {{transition}} metals such as chromium and manganese are usually added to 6000 series Al-Mg-Si <b>alloys</b> to control recrystallization and grain size {{and thus the}} properties of <b>alloys.</b> In Cr/Mn-addition <b>alloys,</b> Cr or Mn will expense Si to form the dispersoids as AlMnSi or AlCrSi and tend to decrease its aging effect. The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of {{transition metals}} (TMs) addition on the hardness and the microstructural features of Al-Mg-Si <b>alloys.</b> Al-Mg-Si <b>alloys,</b> which can be remarked as the quasi-binary <b>alloys</b> of Al-Mg 2 Si, are prepared with Cr or Mn addition by laboratory casting. Some other transition metals, such as Co and Ni, are also added to Al-Mg-Si <b>alloys.</b> The grain size of four <b>alloys</b> decreases with TMs addition, which consequently increases the as-quenched hardness of the <b>alloys</b> comparing {{with that of the}} Al-Mg 2 Si <b>alloy</b> without TMs addition. The difference between Cr/Mn-addition <b>alloy</b> and Co/Ni-addition <b>alloy</b> is that the dispersoids are formed in Co/Ni-addition <b>alloy</b> without expensing Si. Therefore, there is little effect on the aging effect of Si in Co/Ni-addition <b>alloy.</b> 1...|$|R
50|$|Standard <b>alloys</b> are Nickel-Manganese-Gallium (Ni-Mn-Ga) <b>alloys,</b> {{which are}} {{investigated}} {{since the first}} relevant MSM effect has been published in 1996.

The main motivation behind the continuous development and testing of new <b>alloys</b> is to achieve improved thermo-magneto-mechanical properties, such as a lower internal friction, a higher transformation temperature and a higher Curie temperature, which would allow the use of MSM <b>alloys</b> in several applications. In fact, the actual temperature range of standard <b>alloys</b> is up to 50 °C. Recently, a 80 °C <b>alloy</b> has been presented.|$|R
5|$|Palladium {{is one of}} {{the three}} most popular <b>alloying</b> metals in white gold (nickel and silver can also be used). Palladium-gold is more {{expensive}} than nickel-gold, but seldom causes allergic reactions (though certain cross-allergies with nickel may occur).|$|E
5|$|Thorium was {{formerly}} {{used as an}} <b>alloying</b> element in TIG welding electrodes, as a material in high-end optics and scientific instrumentation, and as the light source in gas mantles, but these have become marginal uses.

5|$|ZnO has a {{relatively}} large direct band gap of ~3.3eV at room temperature. Advantages associated with a large band gap include higher breakdown voltages, ability to sustain large electric fields, lower electronic noise, and high-temperature and high-power operation. The bandgap of ZnO can further be tuned to ~3–4eV by its <b>alloying</b> with magnesium oxide or cadmium oxide.|$|E
40|$|The {{thermoelectric}} properties <b>alloys</b> of the nickel-base, iron-base, and cobalt-base groups containing from 1 % to 25 % 106 chromium {{were compared}} and {{correlated with the}} following material characteristics: atomic percent of the principle <b>alloy</b> constituent; ratio of concentration of two constituents; <b>alloy</b> physical property (electrical resistivity); <b>alloy</b> phase structure (percent precipitate or percent hardener content); <b>alloy</b> electronic structure (electron concentration). For solid-solution-type <b>alloys</b> the most consistent correlation was obtained with electron concentration, for precipitation-hardenable <b>alloys</b> of the nickel-base superalloy group, the thermoelectric potential correlated with hardener content in the <b>alloy</b> structure. For solid-solution-type <b>alloys,</b> no problems were found with thermoelectric stability to 1000; for precipitation-hardenable <b>alloys,</b> thermoelectric stability was dependent on phase stability. The effects of the compositional range of <b>alloy</b> constituents on temperature measurement uncertainty are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Annealing is {{the process}} of heating the steel to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the <b>alloying</b> constituents.|$|E
