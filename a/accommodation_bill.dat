50|$|In August 2013, the Sunday Herald {{reported}} that Celia Fitzgerald, an office-bearer within the group, {{had been an}} SNP activist since leaving Labour over the Iraq War. She rejoined Labour in 2012 {{with the aim of}} changing the party's stance towards the referendum. LFI leader Allan Grogan said he knew of examples of SNP members handing out LFI leaflets. He admitted only 40% of his group's 80 or so members are actually in the Labour Party. Grogan also said LFI had received initial financial support from Yes Scotland, regarding the £245 <b>accommodation</b> <b>bill</b> for the LFI's first conference.|$|E
5000|$|The {{campaign}} was {{an alliance of}} the governing Scottish National Party, the Scottish Socialist Party and the Scottish Green Party. The Scottish Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie helped launch the campaign but following this had expressed some reservations. Harvie told the Green's conference in October 2012 that he felt the campaign had become fully inclusive, and the party members voted for [...] "full participation" [...] in the campaign. The organisation also collaborated with Labour for Independence, an organisation for pro-independence supporters of the Scottish Labour Party. In 2013, Yes Scotland covered the £245 <b>accommodation</b> <b>bill</b> for LFI's first conference.|$|E
50|$|The total was R370,385.94. The amount {{obtained}} {{by way of}} overdraft facilities from Standard Bank was R612,309. Although the bank was paid the amounts owing to it, sureties who signed in respect of those facilities lost R18,000, while the furniture firms who issued the <b>accommodation</b> <b>bills</b> lost R25,631.29.|$|R
50|$|Zinn also {{obtained}} {{overdraft facilities}} {{for the company}} at Standard Bank by using the same false balance sheets. In 1965 and 1966, the bank assisted the company by discounting bills and promissory notes from two furnishing companies. Not only was the bank not informed that these bills and notes were in fact accommodation bills; Zinn also fraudulently entered false invoice numbers on these bills in order to present evidence of their being genuine trade bills and notes—the Bank being prohibited from discounting <b>accommodation</b> <b>bills.</b>|$|R
5000|$|His actions did {{not measure}} up to those words. He signed a weak bill to {{integrate}} access to public facilities, but he vetoed a more extensive one that would penalize owners of public places and vehicles who failed to provide equal service to blacks and whites. Historian Francis Byers Harris thought his veto of the public <b>accommodations</b> <b>bill</b> was crucial in eroding his political base. Harris wrote in 1947, [...] "Negroes had their hearts set on this law, and Warmoth sowed a seed of distrust which grew into enmity for the man they had helped elect." ...|$|R
5000|$|The land west of {{the plateau}} road as it {{traverses}} the top is in Zambia, which also calls its portion Nyika National Park, comprising just 80 km2. As {{there is no other}} road, Zambians can only reach it via Malawi. The Zambian park includes a colonial-era resthouse with splendid views west. Once it was the only accommodation in either park, in those days people from Malawi staying there did not have to pass through any border formalities, but paid a [...] "Zambia entrance fee" [...] along with their <b>accommodation</b> <b>bill.</b> The rest house closed in 1998.Proposals to re-open it did not progress and it currently (2015) remains derelict.|$|E
5000|$|The Zambian side is undeveloped {{except for}} a colonial-era resthouse, built around 1946, {{which used to be}} the only {{accommodation}} in either park. After independence, people from Malawi staying there did not have to pass through any border formalities, but paid a [...] "Zambia entrance fee" [...] along with their <b>accommodation</b> <b>bill.</b> It closed in 1998, but was refurbished by a private tour company and reopened in 2006 as the [...] "Nyika House", available only to pre-booked tour groups. As they have already entered Malawi and there are no formalities and restrictions at the boundary between the two parks, visitors from Zambia usually also visit the facilities and features of the Malawian park.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an energy {{management software package}} and the supporting energy information automation system to enable the short stay accommodation industry to determine actual residents 2 ̆ 7 energy consumption. The proposed energy management system is used to develop a 2 ̆ 7 novel deal 2 ̆ 7 method in short stay accommodation based on integration of the room level energy costs into the billing system. This system {{has the potential to}} increase energy efficiency in the short stay accommodation industry by actively engaging the residents in the energy saving process. The system is economically and environmentally sustainable and can achieve a high level of energy efficiency with low expenses. The proposed model is also effective for carbon mitigation, and offers a value proposition for all the parties in the short stay accommodation industry, including owners and residents. The paper presents a software system to capture room level energy consumption information and to present the detail of consumed energy information in the resident 2 ̆ 7 s <b>accommodation</b> <b>bill.</b> The presented information includes energy consumption profile, the greenhouse gas emission profile, and the cost associated to the energy related services...|$|E
6000|$|... [14] Did Constable ruin Scott, as {{has been}} {{generally}} supposed? It is {{right to say that}} such a charge was not made during the lifetime of either. Immediately after Scott's death Miss Edgeworth wrote to Sir James Gibson-Craig and asked him for authentic information as to Sir Walter's connection with Constable. Sir James in reply stated that to his personal knowledge Mr. Constable had, in his anxiety to save Scott, about 1814 [1813], commenced a system of <b>accommodation</b> <b>bills</b> which could not fail to produce, and actually did produce, the ruin of both parties. To another correspondent, some years later, he wrote still more strongly (Memoirs, vol. iii. p. 457).|$|R
50|$|In February 2013, the North Dakota {{legislature}} {{failed to}} pass a bill (Senate Bill 2252) that would have protected LGBT people from discrimination in employment, housing and public <b>accommodations.</b> The <b>bill</b> had failed in the State Senate.|$|R
50|$|In April 2015, the North Dakota {{legislature}} {{failed to}} pass a bill (Senate Bill 2279) that would have protected LGBT people from discrimination in employment, housing and public <b>accommodations.</b> The <b>bill</b> had passed in the State Senate, and failed in the State House.|$|R
50|$|In April 2009, the North Dakota {{legislature}} {{failed to}} pass a bill (Senate Bill 2278) that would have protected LGBT people from discrimination in employment, housing and public <b>accommodations.</b> The <b>bill</b> had passed in the State Senate, but did not have enough votes to pass in the State House.|$|R
5000|$|The {{civil rights}} {{legislation}} which Kennedy was unable to see pass during his lifetime received the needed momentum from his death and the legislative skill of President Johnson. In 1964 the public <b>accommodations</b> <b>bill</b> passed as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The obvious constitutional attack on the legislation was its constitutionality under the Fourteenth Amendment because it sought to regulate conduct which was not [...] "state action." [...] Cox and Assistant Attorney General and Head of the Civil Rights Division Burke Marshall, however founded the legislation on Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. Although both John and Robert Kennedy questioned the optics of using the Commerce Clause, they did not object. Cox had no difficulty having the Court uphold the statute on that basis when he argued the cases in October.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, I cannot {{make you}} come; but I {{think it will}} be only just to Sowerby, {{and it will be a}} favour to me." [...] Robarts again walked up and down the room for half a dozen times, trying to resolve what it would most become him to do in the present emergency. If his name were dragged before the courts,--if he should be shown up in the public papers as having been engaged in <b>accommodation</b> <b>bills,</b> that would {{certainly}} be ruinous to him. He had already learned from Lord Lufton's innuendoes what he might expect to hear as the public version of his share in these transactions! And then his wife,--how would she bear such exposure? [...] "I will meet Mr. Sowerby at your rooms to-morrow, on one condition," [...] he at last said.|$|R
5000|$|On July 2, 1964, Johnson {{signed the}} Civil Rights Act of 1964, that banned {{discrimination}} based on [...] "race, color, religion, sex or national origin" [...] in employment practices and public <b>accommodations.</b> The <b>bill</b> authorized the Attorney General to file lawsuits to enforce the new law. The law also nullified state and local laws that required such discrimination.|$|R

6000|$|And {{then the}} dean, having given his advice, rode away. He could not {{understand}} how a clergyman, situated as was Mr. Robarts, could find himself called upon by friendship to attach his name to <b>accommodation</b> <b>bills</b> which he had not the power of liquidating when due! On that evening they were both wretched enough at the parsonage. Hitherto Mark had hoped that perhaps, after all, no absolutely hostile steps would be taken against him with reference to these bills. Some unforeseen chance might occur in his favour, or the persons holding them might consent to take small instalments of payment from time to time; but now {{it seemed that the}} evil day was actually coming upon him at a blow. He had no longer any secrets from his wife. Should he go to a lawyer? and if so, to what lawyer? And when he had found his lawyer, what should he say to him? Mrs. Robarts at one time suggested that everything should be told to Lady Lufton. Mark, however, could not bring himself to do that. [...] "It would seem," [...] he said, [...] "as though I wanted her to lend me the money." ...|$|R
5000|$|On February 17, 2015, the North Dakota Senate voted 25-22 {{to approve}} {{a bill that would}} ban {{discrimination}} on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in employment, housing and public <b>accommodations.</b> [...] The <b>bill</b> did not receive enough votes to pass in the North Dakota State House.|$|R
50|$|In the Maryland Senate, Madaleno leads {{efforts to}} advance {{legislation}} important to LGBT Marylanders. In 2009, he was lead {{sponsor of the}} Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act, which would legalize same-sex marriage, {{as well as a}} bill to make discrimination against transgender people illegal in housing, employment, and public <b>accommodations.</b> Neither <b>bill</b> was voted on. In 2009, he successfully sponsored legislation with his colleague, Sen. James Robey, to eliminate the inheritance tax paid by domestic partners on jointly-owned primary residences. The legislation becomes law in July 2009.|$|R
5000|$|Nyle T. Milner, a {{hard working}} {{agricultural}} historian, is busy researching {{and working on}} a book about the early harrow. He is in the process of traveling to the Museum of the Tractor located in Harvey, New York for the fourth time. He asks Bill Fipton for recommendations of <b>accommodations,</b> and <b>Bill</b> offers up [...] "The Taits" [...] inn stating that they make an [...] "interesting" [...] soup. He explores the hotel room and comes across a Mr. Potato Head Kit. He opens the box quickly and is surprised to find a real potato with all the facial features still punctured into it. The mummified potato startles him.|$|R
40|$|In 1961, African and Asian diplomats {{traveled}} Route 40 frequently {{between their}} United Nation's offices and their Washington D. C. offices. Many of the eateries along the Maryland {{section of the}} highway practiced segregation, causing a storm of international media coverage and criticism {{in the fall of}} 1961. As a result, the State Department created a special office, the Special Protocol Service Section (SPSS), {{under the auspices of the}} Department of Protocol. Pedro Sanjuan, head of the SPSS, used his position to promote desegregation along Route 40. When State Department intervened in the Maryland debate over accommodations, CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) used the opportunity to promote an open <b>accommodations</b> <b>bill.</b> Maryland had a long history of integrated activism and the Route 40 campaign is one in a history of campaigns to gain equal access to restaurants, stores, and other places of business. CORE planned a freedom ride in order to help end segregation along the highway. Students from the east coast, divided into two caravans, volunteered to leave simultaneously from opposite sides of Route 40, Baltimore City line and the Delaware State line, on November 11, 1961. According to plan, the riders would stop at different eateries until they met in the middle, unless the restaurants voluntarily desegregated. Although the Maryland General Assembly failed to pass state-wide open accommodations legislation, most restaurant owners along the Route 40 corridor in Maryland voluntarily desegregated by February 1962, as a result of the numerous forces pressing for change on Route 40...|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Rhythm and Vines {{expanded}} to a three-day event which allowed the organisers to contract bands {{that were not}} previously available. This was large factor in making the 2008-2009 festival line-up the strongest yet by far, with many renowned international acts on the <b>bill.</b> <b>Accommodation</b> for the festival is mostly provided by BW Summer Festival, a seven-day camping festival that features bands such as Flume, Kora, and State of Mind.|$|R
50|$|Drever wrote {{a private}} member’s bill {{designed}} to protect {{victims of domestic violence}} by allowing them to break leases and move out of their rental <b>accommodations</b> early. Her <b>bill</b> was unanimously approved by the legislature in the fall of 2015 and won her accolades {{from both sides of the}} legislative assembly. In January 2016, after Premier Notley decided that Drever had exceeded the criteria given to her in order to be readmitted into the government caucus, she was allowed to rejoin the NDP caucus.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{influx of}} young adult {{veterans}} {{with mental health}} challenges from recent wars combined with newly expanded veteran education benefits has highlighted {{the need for a}} supported education service within the Veterans Administration. However, it is unknown how such a service should be designed to best respond to these needs. This study undertook a qualitative needs assessment for education supports among veterans with post- 9 / 11 service with self-reported PTSD symptoms. Methods: Focus groups were held with 31 veterans, 54 % of whom were under age 30. Transcripts were analyzed and interpreted using a thematic approach and a Participatory Action Research team. Results: Findings indicate a need for age relevant services that assist with: education planning and access, counseling for the G. I. <b>Bill,</b> <b>accommodations</b> for PTSD symptoms, community and family re-integration, and outreach and support. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The veterans recommended that supported education be integrated with the delivery of mental health services, that services have varied intensity, and there be linkages between colleges and the Veterans Health Administration...|$|R
40|$|Arguing that Native artists {{developed}} a unique modernism between 1940 and 1960 {{as a response}} to cross-cultural encounters requiring both <b>accommodation</b> and resistance, <b>Bill</b> Anthes explores how differing styles of abstraction and growing artistic freedom coexisted with Native identity. During the 1920 s and 1930 s, a style of flat application of color, firmly outlined forms, and readily recognizable nostalgic Native images developed in Oklahoma and Santa Fe. Dominating Indian art for decades, this style became 2 ̆ 2 traditional 2 ̆ 2 Indian painting with its tenants upheld by institutions like the Philbrook Museum in Tulsa where annual Indian painting competitions began in 1946. Between 1940 and 1960 artists broke from these restraints in various ways that have not been examined in detail elsewhere. Anthes begins with Pueblo artists Jose Lente and Jimmy Byrnes who worked with anthropologists Elsie Clews Parsons and Byron Harvey, providing views of Pueblo life. He sees both artists as culture brokers struggling to become modern. Decisions to provide outsiders with insider information were costly, probably more so for Lente who lived at Isleta than for Byrnes in Albuquerque...|$|R
