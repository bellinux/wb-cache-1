The routing was eventually shifted to begin from a new interchange along the New Jersey Turnpike. A total of $50 million in funding was allocated for {{the road and the}} Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was responsible for designing the road. The state had wanted the port <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for construction; however it was ruled that they could not build the road.

50|$|The {{level of}} {{financial}} support for newspapers from the American Government is decreasing and some {{believe this is a}} factor in the decline of the traditional newspaper industry.

Another political issue in 19th-century Greece was uniquely Greek: the language question. The Greek people spoke a form of Greek called Demotic. Many of the educated elite saw this as a peasant dialect and were determined to restore the glories of Ancient Greek.|$|E
25|$|The partial state {{government}} shutdown of July 2005 was an unprecedented fiasco which {{will live on}} {{in the minds of}} MAPE members and other state employees who were sent home for eight days that summer with no knowledge of when they would be allowed to return to work. The governor and legislature failed to pass a state budget by the constitutional deadline of midnight on June 30, 2005 and therefore had no <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> thousands of the state’s employees for work performed. The politicians further attempted to divide state employees by deeming some “essential,” and sending the rest home. The “make half” settlement allowed those workers sent home, through no fault of their own to receive half of the pay or vacation hours lost ten months after the fact.|$|E

The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act was amended to include terrorism or crimes {{of violence in the}} list of qualifying Federal offenses. Another perceived obstacle was to allow federal agencies to share information with federal law enforcement agencies. Thus, the act now allows federal officers who acquire information through electronic surveillance or physical searches to consult with federal law enforcement officers to coordinate efforts to investigate or protect against potential or actual attacks, sabotage or international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} was also subject to limited academic criticism, including a strongly worded article by Professor Roy Goode in the Law Quarterly Review. [...] Goode {{argued that the}} case was wrongly decided for three reasons: first, although the bank lacked express <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> on the cheque, it had implied authority; secondly, that the payee had changed their position and so {{should have had a}} good defence in law; and thirdly (although slightly speculatively) the better solution would be to treat the payment as discharging the debt of the customer and for the bank to be able to reclaim the sums from the customer under the doctrine of subrogation. [...] Goode's criticisms of the decision have not been broadly accepted, either by commentators on the law of restitution, or on banking law.|$|E

This lack of cash also prevented access to basic supplies including the limited stocks of food in the markets. By [...] 5, 18 February days after the operation, cash still did not enter the strip except for a few international organizations. The UN Humanitarian Affairs office stated that a system must be urgently established that ensures the regular and predictable monthly transfer of the necessary cash. On 6 February, Israel allowed the transfer of 42 million US dollars from banks in the West Bank to the Gaza Strip. According to the Bank of Palestine, this money transfer will enable the Palestinian <b>Authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the salaries of its 70,000 Gaza based employees.
