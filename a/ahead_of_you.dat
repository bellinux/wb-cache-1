[...] On television, Dzhokhar's uncle from Montgomery Village, Maryland, pleaded with him to turn himself in.|$|E
2500|$|The Daughters of Bilitis also {{sponsored}} presentations on how {{to accept}} oneself as homosexual in an overwhelming negative society. [...] "Many creative fields lie <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> IF you will stop despising yourselves, stop being ashamed and start creating a place for yourselves on this earth. It is not inconceivable. There are societies in the past which allowed homosexuals their place," [...] said one visiting psychotherapist.|$|E

2500|$|All four gospels record Peter's {{denial of}} Jesus, {{and all of}} the {{synoptic}} gospels record how Peter [...] "wept bitterly" [...] after the rooster crowed. John omits this detail, but he is unique in describing the restoration scene between Jesus and Peter. Jesus words in Mark 16:7, however, are often thought to carry the message of Peter's restoration: [...] "But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> into Galilee...’" [...] (NIV).|$|E

I've been put into a situation that I have never wanted to be in. For the first time on a television show, I am angry." [...] And after choosing to eliminate Keisha, he told her, [...] "You were absolutely wonderful. I think you have a huge career <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> and all I can say is that I'll do anything I can to help you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In response, the Admiralty issued orders on 10 February 1915 which {{directed}} merchant {{ships to}} escape from hostile U-boats when possible, but [...] "if a submarine comes up suddenly close <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> with obvious hostile intention, steer straight for her at your utmost speed..." [...] Further instructions ten days later advised armed steamers to open fire on a submarine {{even if it had}} not yet fired. Given the extreme vulnerability of a submarine to ramming or even small-caliber shellfire, a U-boat that surfaced and gave warning against a merchantman which had been given such instructions was putting itself in great danger. The Germans knew of these orders, even though they were intended to be secret, copies having been obtained from captured ships and from wireless intercepts; Bailey and Ryan in their [...] "The Lusitania Disaster", put much emphasis on these Admiralty orders to merchantmen, arguing it was unreasonable to expect a submarine to surface and give warning under such circumstances. In their opinion this, rather than the munitions, the nonexistent armament, or any other suggested reason, is the best rationale for the Germans' actions in the sinking.|$|E

[...] Baird was left without a football coach {{for the second time}} in eight months. [...] At the end of the 1900 football season, Stanford University passed a rule requiring all coaches to be alumni. [...] The decision left Stanford's football coach, Fielding H. Yost, who was not an alumnus, without a job. [...] Yost wrote to the University of Illinois in December 1900 seeking a job. [...] Illinois did not have an opening, but the school's athletic director passed along Yost's letter to Baird at Michigan.

[...] Baird met Yost at the Ann Arbor train station, where Yost is reported to have told Baird, [...] "There are three things that make a winning football team, spirit, manpower and coaching. [...] If your boys love Meeshegan, they've got the spirit, you see. [...] If they turnout, that takes care of the manpower. [...] I'll take care of the coaching."

5000|$|This {{variation}} of Euchre is {{played with a}} regular deck and 4 players. The player left of the dealer calls trump before the cards are dealt.

If any other suit comes up other than the [...] "predicted" [...] trump the 2 other players and dealer {{have the option of}} either [...] "ordering it up" [...] or [...] "pick it up". Game continues as normal. When calling trump <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> time <b>you</b> can decide to [...] "go alone" [...] but you can not change your mind after you see your cards. If you get all 5 tricks you receive 5 points. If <b>you</b> call trump <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> time and call [...] "for the game", you are going alone plus you play all your cards face down. If you get all five tricks (good luck) you receive 10 points and win the game. If at any time you go alone and do not at least get 3 tricks it is called getting [...] "Larried".|$|R
