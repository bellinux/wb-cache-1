30|$|As {{large-scale}} {{and detailed}} datasets on freight flows are often scarce, background {{information on the}} available data sources should be gathered and only appropriate data sources are to be selected for the analysis. For the case study described in the next section, the data sources were selected based on information availability concerning: (i) the origin and destination of relevant transport flows; (ii) the type of loading unit (e.g. containers); (iii) the year of reference (maximum 5  years ago); (iv) the geographic level of detail of origin <b>and</b> <b>destination</b> (<b>e.g.</b> NUTS 3); (v) the unit expressing the transport volumes and (vi) the product type. Few datasets, however, include information on this latter criterion. Therefore, relevant datasets not including product information are not excluded. The accuracy and {{the reliability of the}} results of this analysis will thus depend {{on the extent to which}} these available datasets represent real-life transport flows.|$|E
30|$|The forward {{distribution}} system is usually characterized by its sources (=dispatching locations), destinations (=points of reception) and associated links. To understand {{distribution system}}s within OC retailing, {{we need to}} consider the different types of sources (e.g., DCs <b>and</b> stores) <b>and</b> <b>destinations</b> (<b>e.g.,</b> stores <b>and</b> customers) in the physical distribution structure, as well as possible delivery processes and modes, i.e., shipments to customers and stores (e.g., Fernie and Sparks 2009; Hübner et al. 2013 a).|$|R

30|$|A {{plethora of}} macro- and micro-level factors {{give rise to}} {{international}} migration, such as psychological, social, economic, political and environmental factors in countries of origin <b>and</b> <b>destination</b> (<b>e.g.</b> Castles et al. 2014). Depending on the setting, income and employment differences between countries and regions can be important in explaining international migration, {{such as in the}} case of our study countries. In the academic literature, several theories confirm that spatial differences in employment are important to international migration. For instance, dual and segmented labour market theories posit that migration is mainly the result of labour needs in destination countries arising from upward job mobility of the resident population, away from insecure, low-quality and low-income jobs. Immigrants are expected to fill such positions. People migrate because they are ‘pulled’ by demands and opportunities in foreign labour markets. Neoclassical economic theory adds a micro-level decision-making perspective by arguing that persons migrate because financial returns to their educational attainment and occupational skills are higher elsewhere. The new economics of migration theory expounds this view by pointing to the importance of the household as the decision-making unit. In this context, decisions are taken as to who migrates and what is expected of the migrant. Migration is just one of several income risk-aversion and risk-diversification strategies households apply to survive. Migrants are expected to remit part of their earnings leading some receivers to migrate too. World systems theory places micro-level migration decision-making in the wider context of societal-level factors. For instance, interacting labour markets may lead to the transfer of conventions about employer-employee relations from one country to another, pushing certain people out of work in one country and increasing demand for their labour in another country, leading to migration (Castles et al. 2014; Van Dalen et al. 2005 a).|$|E
25|$|Mountainous {{parts of}} {{southern}} Silesia feature many significant <b>and</b> attractive tourism <b>destinations</b> (<b>e.g.,</b> Karpacz, Szczyrk, Wisła).

50|$|Gdańsk Lech WałęsaAirport has two {{passengers}} terminals (T1 and T2), {{of which}} only Terminal T2 is fully functional. Terminal T1 {{was built in}} 1993 and is currently being used for departures (passport control and boarding) to countries which {{are not part of}} Schengen Area, mainly to Great Britain, Ireland <b>and</b> holiday <b>destinations</b> <b>e.g.</b> to Egypt. There is no check-in desks in Terminal T1 but passengers waiting for their flights can do the shopping at duty-free stores located close to the departure gates. The building is connected with the newer Terminal T2 with a bridge. The old building is planned to be torn down in the future when the new terminal is extended.|$|R
50|$|As in {{the example}} above, {{location}} plays {{a large role in}} mixed mode commuting. Rapid transit such as express bus or light rail may cover most of the distance, but sit too far out from commute endpoints. At 3 mph walking, 2 miles represents about 40 minutes of commute time; whereas a bicycle may pace 12 mph leisurely, cutting this time to 10 minutes. When the commuter finds the distance between the originating endpoint (e.g. the home) <b>and</b> the <b>destination</b> (<b>e.g.</b> the place of employment) too far to be enjoyable or practical, commute by car or motorcycle to the station may remain practical, as long as the commute from the far end station to the destination is practical by walking, a carry-on cycle, or another rapid transit such as a local or shuttle bus.|$|R
50|$|On the BMT system, most in-station signage {{specified}} To City and From City. Currently signs typically read To Manhattan, if {{the train}} is heading toward Manhattan, <b>and</b> To <b>Destination</b> (<b>e.g.</b> To Coney Island or To Canarsie), if {{the train is}} heading toward an outer-borough destination. If the train is headed to a different borough, it is described as Borough-bound (e.g. Manhattan-bound or Brooklyn-bound). If its terminus {{is in the same}} borough, it will be described as Terminus-bound, for example, Eighth Avenue-bound or Rockaway Parkway-bound. If the final destination is more than one borough away, signs will generally display the name of the next one or two boroughs that the route will pass through. Trains would display To Uptown and Borough if the train is heading uptown and into another borough, or To Downtown and Borough if the train is heading downtown and into another borough.|$|R
30|$|The {{challenge}} of a routing protocol is selecting the optimum or minimal path {{to communicate the}} source (e.g., the video server) <b>and</b> the <b>destination</b> (<b>e.g.,</b> the mesh client). Taking advantage from the static backbone, the focus of routing protocols for WMNs should be on achieving higher throughput rather than saving energy or improving resiliency for mobility [15]. There are three general categories of routing protocols namely: reactive, proactive, and hybrid [16 – 18]. Reactive protocols only search for a path between two nodes when there are data to send. This method {{has the advantage of}} not wasting network bandwidth with control messages when data transmission is not required. Reactive protocols are ideally suited to an ad hoc network with mobile nodes where data path may change continuously whereas proactive protocols actively establish and maintain data paths for nodes whether data are needed to be transferred or not. The advantage of this kind of protocol is a low latency in sending data through the network since an optimized data path is already known before the transmission. Nevertheless, this comes at a price in terms of higher cost of network overhead associated to both network control messages and computational processing.|$|R

30|$|The {{present study}} {{attempts}} {{to answer these}} questions by proposing a new methodology and analysing accessibility change in Spain at the NUTS- 3 level, over a 50  year period between 1960 and 2010. During this period a significant transformation of transport infrastructure and economic activity took place. We do so by applying index number theory, which allows us to aggregate (i.e. summarize into a single scalar) the bilateral relation between a given location (origin) <b>and</b> its surrounding <b>destinations</b> (<b>e.g.</b> commercial partners), considering infrastructure as the main input yielding accessibility to economic opportunities. Infrastructure, in the form of travel time, is considered as the input producing accessibility to markets as output, resulting in a productivity index that is defined as the ratio of potential economic opportunities to infrastructure. Furthermore, resorting to the product rule of index numbers, we can consistently decompose accessibility change across locations and over time, enabling us to disentangle the contribution of transport infrastructure from the land-use dimension.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decades {{trafficking}} in human being {{has become one of}} the most lucrative criminal enterprises all over the world, with strong links to other illegal activities, such as money laundering, drug trafficking, document forgery, and smuggling. The US Justice Department estimated that annually some 700, 000 women and children are bought, sold, transported and held in slavery-like conditions for sexual and labour exploitation. IOM estimates that around 120, 000 women and children are being trafficked into the European Union each year, primarily through the Balkans, and 10, 000 women, mostly from Moldova, Romania and Ukraine, are working only in the sex trade industry in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, trafficking is not only a criminal act against human rights and dignity, but an ever increasing public health issue as it is stated in the Budapest Declaration adopted by the participants of the ministerial level Regional Conference on Public Health & Trafficking in Human Beings in Central, Eastern and Southeast Europe, held on 19 - 21 March 2003, in Budapest. Providing appropriate health promotion and care services for trafficked persons is not only a humanitarian obligation, but also a public health concern for countries of origin, transit <b>and</b> <b>destination</b> alike. (<b>Eg.</b> : Medical records from Moldavia show that some 88 per cent of the ex-victims return to their homeland with sexually transmitted infections (STI), and about the same number (84 per cent) exhibit chronic anxiety disorders with the mix of depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). The module provides a framework not only for the assessment and treatment of specific health and mental health needs of the ex-victims of trafficking, but takes a large-scale public health perspective of a community approach to prevention and health promotion of most vulnerable social groups to this kind of abuse and violence...|$|R
