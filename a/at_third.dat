5|$|Youkilis is an on-base machine. He never swings at a bad pitch, and is {{adept at}} working counts and out-thinking the pitcher. Unlike some guys who draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid contact against both fastballs and {{breaking}} pitches. Youkilis' swing is tailored for the line drive, {{and he may}} never hit for much home run power. But he hits balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 10–14 home run power down the road. Youkilis does not have very good speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His defense <b>at</b> <b>third</b> base draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate/average. He doesn't kill the defense <b>at</b> <b>third</b> base, but he doesn't help it much, either, {{and is likely to}} end up at first base down the road.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{statistical}} analysis indicates Robinson was an outstanding fielder throughout his {{ten years in}} the major leagues and at virtually every position he played. After playing his rookie season at first base, Robinson spent most of his career as a second baseman. He led the league in fielding among second basemen in 1950 and 1951. Toward the end of his career, he played about 2,000 innings <b>at</b> <b>third</b> base and about 1,175 innings in the outfield, excelling at both.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Orioles signed {{free agent}} shortstop Mike Bordick from the Oakland Athletics and moved Ripken back to third base permanently.
