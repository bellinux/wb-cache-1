I wanted {{to show that you}} can have a child and you can work hard <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> your body back. I know that there's so many women that feel the same thing after they give birth. You can have your child and you can still have fun and still be sexy and still have dreams and still live for yourself. I'm not embarrassed about it, and I don't feel like I have to protect that side of me because I do believe that {{sexuality}} is a power we all have." ...|$|E
500|$|After leaving The Simpsons and The George Carlin Show, Simon {{sought to}} find a [...] "life outside television," [...] as working in the {{industry}} [...] "made [...] crazy." [...] On working in television, Simon concluded: [...] "In some ways, it's the greatest job in the world. You make a product that's given away, and all it does is make people smile. Nobody gets hurt, there's no damage, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> crazy rich." [...] Simon retired from full-time television work, although still worked in the media, frequently contributing, {{as a writer and}} a participant, to Howard Stern's radio shows. He wrote and directed the one-off radio sitcom [...] "The Bitter Half" [...] for Stern's Howard 101 in 2006. Simon had his own show on Radioio. Simon returned to television production work in 2012, serving as a consultant and director on the series Anger Management for half a day a week.|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} generally negative reviews at release, garnering {{scores of}} 50% and 49/100 by aggregate sites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. Computer and Video Games said [...] "Eorzea {{is a beautiful}} world with huge potential for vast adventures, but it's just a shame that this first voyage into {{it is such a}} mis-step". 1UP.com said that [...] "playing [...] is like playing with a toy stuck in a plastic bag: it can be fun for a while <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> the general idea, but you can't appreciate the full experience", stating that future updates would likely rectify this issue. IGN said that [...] "Much of the promise of the combat system and depth of the crafting mechanics are drowned, unfortunately, under a sea of interface and performance issues that hinder the experience at nearly every step", further stating that while patches might improve the experience, its state {{at the time of the}} review made it [...] "not a world worth visiting". GameSpot, in addition to warning players away from the game, said that [...] "Final Fantasy XIV is a notable entry to the genre but only for what it lacks".|$|E

500|$|Clarkson co-wrote {{the seventh}} track, [...] "Where Is Your Heart", with DioGuardi and Chantal Kreviazuk. She {{revealed}} {{that it was}} also about her boyfriend, Hodges, whom she described as [...] "wanting to get really into our relationship, and I just thought, 'Where are you in our relationship?'" [...] "Walk Away", the eight track, was also written by the three, with additional writing by Raine Maida. Clarkson described it as [...] "one of the brighter songs" [...] on Breakaway, and said that [...] "It's very blunt and to the point. 'I'm done with you, you're upsetting me.'" [...] DioGuardi and Shanks co-wrote the ninth track, [...] "You Found Me". Clarkson revealed, [...] "When I recorded this one, I was actually in a good place with a guy. It was very fitting {{at the time that}} I recorded it." [...] DioGuardi had also co-written the tenth track, [...] "I Hate Myself for Losing You", with Jimmy Harry and Shep Solomon. Clarkson described the song as [...] "depressing", but felt it {{could be used as a}} foreshadowing device. She explained [...] "I read something that Sting said in an interview, he talked about how the great thing about writing is that it is an emotional and therapeutic thing <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> it out." [...] The eleventh track, [...] "Hear Me", was written by Clarkson, DioGuardi, and Clif Magness. Clarkson explained the song, [...] "It's is almost like a prayer to God. I haven't met the person whom I will spend the rest of my life with, but the song is a prayer to God about that. That's what the song is. 'God, I'm ready for 'the one!'" [...] The twelfth and closing track is a live recording of [...] "Beautiful Disaster", originally from Thankful. Clarkson admitted that she hated Thankfuls version of the song, and thought the production was distracting from the lyrics. So she decided to record a piano ballad version instead.|$|E
