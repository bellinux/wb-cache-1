I’m not amazed <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> I’ve watched the pros play. They run traps, they pitch the ball, they sweep. What else is there? - John McKay, in Sports Illustrated ...|$|E
500|$|Brooks & Dunn {{began the}} Long Haul tour in mid-2006, which {{featured}} Sugarland and Jack Ingram as opening acts. Of this tour, Brooks said, [...] "They've {{got a lot}} of shows under their belt, they're really good <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> and they are great performersWe want everything about this show from opening act 'til the lights go down to be first class." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joe Tangari of Pitchfork Media {{gave the}} album {{a score of}} 8.0 out of 10, writing [...] "... They may not be doing {{anything}} especially new, but Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings are the very best <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> and they've made another excellent album." [...] In another positive review, Allmusic's Marisa Brown stated [...] "... that's the magic and power of Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings: their ability to convey passion and pain, regret and celebration, found in the arrangements and the tail ends of notes, in the rhythms and phrasing, and it is exactly that which makes 100 Days, 100 Nights such and excellent release." ...|$|E

[...] "And I didn't expect anything less of myself. I worked even harder than maybe other people because I wanted to be just like those great athletes that were there before me. If my teammates around me were doing so well, I wanted to elevate myself to that next level with them." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Beatles reinvented and {{expanded}} {{the terms of}} commercial and artistic achievement, treading new ground for their willingness to experiment and take risks. One criticism of the group's work {{is that none of}} it was truly unprecedented. Author Bill Martin objects to this notion: [...] "There has always been experimentation in rock music ... Rock music is synthesis and transmutation ... but what was original about the Beatles is that they synthesized and transmuted more or less everything, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> this in a way that reflected their time, they reflected their time in a way that spoke to a great part of humanity, and <b>they</b> <b>did</b> all of this really, really well." [...] Unterberger adds: [...] "they were among the few artists of any discipline that were simultaneously the best <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> and the most popular <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b> Relentlessly imaginative and experimental, the Beatles grabbed hold of the international mass consciousness in 1964 and never let go for the next six years, always staying ahead of the pack in terms of creativity but never losing their ability to communicate their increasingly sophisticated ideas to a mass audience. Their supremacy as rock icons remains unchallenged to this day, decades after their breakup in 1970." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Grateful Dead's {{early music}} (in the mid-1960s) {{was part of}} the process of {{establishing}} what [...] "psychedelic music" [...] was, but theirs was essentially a [...] "street party" [...] form of it. They developed their [...] "psychedelic" [...] playing as a result of meeting Ken Kesey in Palo Alto, California, and subsequently becoming the house band for the Acid Tests he staged. The Dead were not inclined to fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country & western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and, more frequently, melding several of them. It was doubtless with this in mind that Bill Graham said of the Grateful Dead, [...] "They're not the best <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> they're the only ones that do what they do." [...] Often (both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes.|$|E

Humanity is a huge {{aggregate}} lie, and a huge lie is less than a small truth. Humanity is less, far less than the individual, because the individual may sometimes be capable of truth, and humanity is a tree of lies. And they say that love is the greatest thing; they persist in SAYING this, the foul liars, and just look <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do!</b> Look at all the millions of people who repeat every minute that love is the greatest, and charity is the greatest--and see what they are doing all the time.

He disputed the assertion that terrorists were cowards by saying, [...] "Look <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b> You have {{a whole bunch of}} guys who were willing to give their life; none of them backed out. All of them slammed themselves into pieces of concrete. These are warriors." [...] Maher agreed with D'Souza's comments and said, [...] "We have been the cowards.

50|$|Generally, both backhands are {{efficient}} <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> The type of backhand {{a player}} uses {{comes down to}} mostly personal preference and their game style.

A man living in falsehood, and on falsehood; yet not what you can call a false man: there is the specialty!

50|$|Air {{talent was}} {{generally}} more low-key on the Brennan stations than on typical Top 40's, projecting a warm, friendly, “real” attitude, {{without a lot}} of hype. Many of them were very good <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b> <b>They</b> were bigger than life. Colorful word pictures and a sense of shared experience were definitely a part of the equation. Each of these stations was designed to serve a large, and largely rural, area. Typically, they might not be rated #1 in the Metro (the city and the counties closest to the city), but showed strong ratings in the overall area.... Their greatest strength was in the outlying areas. For many listeners, these stations were a musical lifeline... the one radio station that provided a strong signal and played the music they liked.|$|R

5000|$|This was a {{movie that}} Ann made on her new {{contract}} she just signed with the RKO studios which kept her very busy {{for a couple of}} years. If there wasn't an RKO film that fit Ann, she was then sent off to work for other studios around town. Ann made a total of six films in nineteen thirty-six alone, and eight more in nineteen thirty-seven. And in those days, making movies was a six-days-a-week affair.
