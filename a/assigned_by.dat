5000|$|The {{algorithm}} is often presented as assigning {{objects to the}} nearest cluster by distance. The standard algorithm aims at minimizing the WCSS objective, and thus <b>assigns</b> <b>by</b> [...] "least sum of squares", which is exactly equivalent to <b>assigning</b> <b>by</b> the smallest Euclidean distance. Using a different distance function other than (squared) Euclidean distance may stop the algorithm from converging. Various modifications of k-means such as spherical k-means and k-medoids have been proposed to allow using other distance measures.|$|R
