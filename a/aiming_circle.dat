40|$|Randomly spread {{fibroblasts}} on fibronectin-coated elastomeric membranes {{respond to}} cyclic strain by a varying degree of focal adhesion assembly and actin reorganization. We {{speculated that the}} individual shape of the cells, which is linked to cytoskeletal structure and pre-stress, might tune these integrin-dependent mechanotransduction events. To this <b>aim,</b> fibronectin <b>circles,</b> squares and rectangles of identical surface area (2000 &# 0956;m 2) were micro-contact printed onto elastomeric substrates. Fibroblasts plated on these patterns occupied the corresponding shapes. Cyclic 10 % equibiaxial strain was applied to patterned cells for 30 min, and changes in cytoskeleton and cell-matrix adhesions were quantified after fluorescence staining. After strain, megakaryocytic leukemia- 1 protein translocated to the nucleus in most cells, indicating efficient RhoA activation independently of cell shape. However, circular and square cells (with radial symmetry) showed a significantly greater {{increase in the number}} of actin stress fibers and vinculin-positive focal adhesions after cyclic strain than rectangular (bipolar) cells of identical size. Conversely, cyclic strain induced larger changes in pY 397 -FAK positive focal complexes and zyxin relocation from focal adhesions to stress fibers in bipolar compared to symmetric cells. Thus, radially symmetric cells responded to cyclic strain with a larger increase in assembly, whereas bipolar cells reacted with more pronounced reorganization of actin stress fibers and matrix contacts. We conclude that integrin-mediated responses to external mechanical strain are differentially modulated in cells that have the same spreading area but different geometries, and do not only depend on mere cell size...|$|R

Initially, the angle between the aiming point and target area was deduced or estimated and this angle set on the azimuth sight, each gun then laid on the aiming point with this angle (sometimes corrected for each gun to keep them aimed roughly parallel to each other). However, for artillery another instrument, called either a director (UK) or <b>aiming</b> <b>circle</b> (US), became widespread and eventually the primary method of orienting guns in most if not all armies.

40|$|Abstract — This work investigates a multithreat {{containment}} problem where a team {{of autonomous}} robots cooperate to contain occurring threats. The robots <b>aim</b> to form <b>circles</b> around multiple threats that appear at random times and expire after a certain time. Containing single static threats has been studied, yet extending it to the dynamic regime with threat lifetime overlapping presents additional complex challenges. An algorithm named MUltiple Threat Containment Algorithm (MUTCA) is proposed and analyzed in this work. MUTCA is designed for simplicity and based on Quadratic Artificial Potential Functions (QAPF) {{and the use of}} random walks. Multiple QAPFs are carefully designed to allow robots to move toward the threats, to avoid collisions, and to surround the threats evenly. This work investigates the capabilities and limitations of autonomous robots utilizing MUTCA via simulation using MAHESHDAS- a simulator developed to simulate autonomous robots. Application specific success rates are examined for various scenarios and robot sensor capabilities. MUTCA has been found to work well with sufficient robots that have moderate capabilities, but is sensitive to application specific parameters. I...|$|R

50|$|Each {{chapter is}} patrolled by many guards. Basic sword-wielding guards {{are the most}} common enemy and they can send flying slashes of light in their general direction. There are also archers that patrol {{elevated}} areas and can spot the player at a longer distance while <b>aiming,</b> and swordsmen <b>circled</b> by a torch that kills the player on contact. A guard can be killed instantly by attacking him within a certain range, but the only enemy that must be killed to complete a chapter is the boss (if present). Observing evidence of the player's presence (such as the sound of their comrades dying or spotting the player in the distance) will make guards suspicious, causing them to draw their swords and investigate. If they find a corpse or see the player clearly, they will blow a horn, temporarily making all the guards actively search for Aragami, and causing them to become more suspicious if the player evades detection. Any successful hit by a guard will kill Aragami instantly, returning the player to the last checkpoint to try again. The player can also die by falling into water.|$|R

Production started in 1980 {{with the use of}} components from both the BMP-1 and BMP-2. Fifty IRMs were produced from 1986. However, the suspension had a new hull, one extra road wheel and one additional hydraulic shock-absorber. It has four pressurized compartments, with the engine located at the rear. There are three hatches {{on the top of the}} hull and one emergency hatch in the bottom. The IRM is equipped with two retractable propellers in ring covers for swimming and steering and two cases with 16 9M39 solid engines (each has a thrust of 312 kg and weighs 6.3 kg), for getting out of mud. Special reconnaissance equipment consists of two R-147 radios; one PIR-451 periscope; TNPO-160, TNP-370 and TNV-25M periscopic observation devices; an AGI-1s horizon indicator; a DSP-30 portable periscopic rangefinder, a PAB-2M portable <b>aiming</b> <b>circle,</b> one TNA-3 gyroscopic navigational device, an EIR echo depth finder with automatic recorder and three sonar transducers, a RShM-2 river-type wide-span mine detector, RVM-2M and IMP-2 portable mine detectors, a PR-1 portable penetrometer used to analyze soil for crossability and an ice drill with ice stake. The vehicle has two arms for detecting metallic mines which are mounted on the front of the hull. They can be retracted when not in use. The mine detector arms can be hydraulically articulated to their operating position in under three minutes. The mine detector brings the vehicle to a full stop upon encountering an obstacle or detecting a metallic object. The PIR-451 periscope is mounted on the right hand side of the front of the vehicle, at the commander's station. It can be extended to 1.5 m and can move vertically up to 750 mm. The IRM also has an air revitalization system, automatic fire extinguishers, a water pump with a capacity of 1,000 l/min, an automatic NBC protection system and an engine thermal smoke generator. It weighs 17.2 tonnes and has a crew of six. It is 8.22 m long, 3.15 m wide and 2.40 m high. Ground clearance is 420 mm. It has a maximum road speed of 52 km/h and it can swim at up to 12 km/h. It is armed with a PKT machine gun fitted in a small turret for which it carries 1,000 rounds. In the west, the IRM was believed to be based on the 2S1 Gvozdika self-propelled howitzer until 1986 when its true origins became known.|$|E

She found an advocate in John Stuart Mill but he believed that all women should be given the vote. Goldsmid argued against this believing that it was more realistic to ask that the vote be given only to spinsters and widows. Mill proceeded with his more ambitious proposal and the cause was lost. At this point Goldsmid realised that she and Emily Davies should ignore the campaign to gain votes for women and concentrate on the more achievable goal of gaining the right of women to gain university degrees. London University allowed women to gain degrees in 1878. This was the same year that her husband died and Goldsmid's philanthropy established three scholarships for female pianists. Goldsmid continued her advocacy of women's education albeit for middle class women. (In 1887 Cambridge University submitted to change and allowed women to take the tripos examinations.) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{essay is}} a {{response}} to the ‘polyphonic debate’ on interpretive accounting research (Ahrens et al., this issue). The debate is considered first as a case study of the limitations of collaborative circles [Farrell MP. Collaborative circles: friendship dynamics and creative work. Chicago: University of Chicago Press; 2001. ] as a means of developing a particular approach to research. Whilst they may serve to reassure the individual that s(h) e is part of a consequential community of practice, they tend to do so at the expense of suppressing the mutual criticism on which the development of clear and robust ideas depends. Further, because such <b>circles</b> <b>aim</b> to promote their approach as well as define it, intellectual development tends to become confused with, and possibly subsumed by, the politics of academic career-making. The paper then considers the case for interpretive accounting research as such. Because the polyphonic debate itself is uninformative in this respect, this consideration is based on a theoretical paper by Ahrens and Chapman [Ahrens T, Chapman C. Doing qualitative field research in management accounting: positioning data to contribute to theory. Accounting, Organisations and Society, 2006; 31 (8) : 819 – 41] and an ethnographic case study of organizational control by Ahrens and Mollona [Ahrens T, Mollona M. Organisational control as cultural practice—a shop floor ethnography of a sheffield steel mill. Accounting, Organisations and Society, 2007; 32 (4 – 5) : 305 – 496. ] The burden of both papers is that interpretive research offers a radical alternative to ‘traditional’ positivist approaches and that it possesses a unique potential to contribute to theory. Neither of these contentions is borne out. The anti-positivism conventionally attributed to interpretive approaches is shown to be based on a misunderstanding whilst Ahrens and Mollona's illustrative case study turns out to be itself positivist and also to contribute very little to theories of organizational control. This last fault may lie as much with the expectation as with the ethnography itself. The kind of theory developed in the course of ethnographic interpretation is short-range and situation-specific rather than abstract and general. The paper concludes with a brief consideration of {{the manner in which the}} two levels of theorisation might relate to one another...|$|R

40|$|Every year, {{hundreds}} of thousands of people participate in art and handicrafts study circles organized by educational associations, and thus receive an increased esthetic education. The degree of this increase in knowledge is dependent on the quality of the particular study circle, the extent to which they live up to the aims and conditions required for the receipt of state grants. There are some indications that educational associations sometimes close their eyes to these aims and conditions and neglect to provide information about them. An educational association is able to control the quality of art and handicrafts study circles—for example, through the selection of course leaders, and by providing course leaders with better information and in-house training. Educational associations also receive state grants for this type of activity. The grants are not specifically ear-marked for this purpose, and it is the educational association itself that decides how to use the grants received. Certain areas of activity can be given priority over others. It is therefore of interest to examine the official attitudes of the various aducational associations towards their activities within the area of arts and handicrafts. This study, which concentrates on the four major educational associations in Sweden- the Workers' Educational Association (ABF), the Adult Educational Association (Vuxenskolan), the Educational Association of the Citizens' School (Medborgarskolan), and the Salaried Employees' Educational Association (TBV) -is based on the following: - a direct method, involving an analysis of official publications, e. g. charter, programme, publications and journals - a questionnaire directed to the Directors of Studies at the various educational associations - an indirect method involving the analysis of the educational associations' reactions to the cultural policy introduced in the 1970 s. The results of the study show that none of the educational associations give esthetic activities the highest priority, despite the fact that in the eases of Medborgarskolan and Vuxenskolan these activities are clearly dominant, and also constitute the major activity for TBV. There are many signs that instead indicate that the interest in esthetic activities is rather luke-warm. The associations also question the aims and conditions that the state has drawn up in order to maintain a certain standard in the content of study circles. TBV and Medborgarskolan consider these aims and conditions to be too demanding. Vuxenskolan does not appear to have any unified policy concerning these aims and conditions, and ABF appears to deny the very existence of fixed <b>aims</b> for study <b>circle</b> acitivites. digitalisering@um...|$|R
40|$|The present {{dissertation}} is {{the first}} study of Yliki lake which aims at its thermal characterization, {{the expression of the}} seasonal variation of the main chemical species concentrations in its water column and the application, for the first time, of a systematic prediction mechanism of the formation of all the chemical species of the metals Cd, Cu and Ni, thus specializing their toxicity from the level of total concentration to that of chemical species. The natural lake Yliki {{is considered to be a}} mesotrophic lake. Ιt stands in an area with intense industrial activity and this increases the chances of pollutant inflow into the lake. The lake was studied for two complete seasonal <b>circles</b> <b>aiming</b> at the recording of the variability of its physicochemical characteristics in time. The parameters determined in the lake study were the pH and temperature in the field and in the laboratory, the ions Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, NH 4 + F-, Cl-, Br-, NO 2 -, NO 3 -, PO 43 -, SO 42 -, HCO 3 -, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the metals Cd 2 +, Cu 2 +, Ni 2 +, as well as the total concentrations of Cd, Cu and Ni after digestion with dense HNO 3. The values of the above parameters were used to quantitatively determine the seasonal variation of the chemical species of the metals Cd, Cu και Ni. The determination of the chemical species of copper, nickel and cadmium using MINTEQA 2 showed that the main chemical species of Cu in Yliki lake are the Cu 2 +, CuCO 3 and Cu(CO 3) 22 -, of Ni the Ni 2 +, NiHCO 3 + and NiCO 3 and of Cd the Cd 2 +, Cd(CO 3) 22 - and CdCO 3. Yliki lake proves the ability of favoring the formation of the less toxic species of the metals copper, nickel and cadmium comparing to the formation of their free ions during the summer season in the epilimnion, where bioactivity and water uptake increase. In this way, through a series of physical and chemical mechanisms, the lake protects the food chain from the toxic factors. This ability of the lake is mostly due to its monomictic ability and would be lost in the case of a dramatic loss of its water column height, so that a thermal stratification would not be possible. Yliki lake would also lose its ability of neutralizing the three metals if the environmental conditions change dramatically and more precisely the temperature and pH of water so that the concentration of carbonate and bicarbonate ions in water would considerably lower. ...|$|R

The purpose of Knowledge Circle is to provide professionals working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders with quality, evidence-based information, resources and interactive support. Guiding principles Knowledge <b>Circle</b> <b>aims</b> to provide work guided by the principles of self-determination, empowerment and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander connection to spirit, country and culture. Who should use Knowledge Circle? Knowledge Circle is for practitioners, service providers, researchers, community leaders, non-government organisations and governments, plus anyone who: supports children and families in the child protection system;works to prevent vulnerable children and families from entering the child protection system;tackles complex issues that impact on the safety and wellbeing of children; and,aims to strengthen communities so children can feel safe and supported. Focus areas Responses to disadvantage (through services and program delivery), and {{not just on the}} extent of disadvantage that impacts on the safety and wellbeing of children and families. Positive and innovative approaches to program delivery and service practices. An ecological approach that captures the interrelatedness of child, family and community factors that influence child/family safety and wellbeing. How programs aim to deliver outcomes in relation to program objectives. Linking stories about "what works" to existing evidence-based research. Themes and topics Knowledge Circle adopts an ecological approach that highlights the impact of a child 2 ̆ 7 s surroundings (including family and community) on their safety and wellbeing. The approach provides Knowledge Circle users with a framework to generate discussion and to explore the website for relevant information. As users contribute to Knowledge Circle, a range of sub-topics will emerge over time. Examples of sub-topics are included in the following themes: Children and young people - for example: early literacy; school readiness and retention; health promotion, including physical and mental health; suicide prevention; substance misuse; prevention of involvement in the criminal justice system. Family support - for example: Parenting support and education; substance misuse; family violence prevention; health promotion; intergenerational trauma and healing. Community support - for example: Social inclusion/exclusion; community development and/or strengthening; cultural education, including building cultural awareness and competency. Service capacity - for example: Improving service uptake; workforce development; service delivery coordination; engaging hard-to-reach groups...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays people {{playing games}} {{not only for}} fun, but also is using in terms of education, {{medicine}} and researches. For example, video games are taking {{important role in the}} development of children. Some 15 years ago every parent was trying to educate their children apart from the school by teaching themselves or buying books for them, but now technology and video games makes it much easier. By playing games children can learn languages, differentiate shapes and colors from the childhood without forcing and having a fun [1]. There is fast development on Human Computer Interface (HCI) technologies for controlling video games. Big companies find very different ways to get user input for better game interactions in earlier days. There are three popular different approaches for this purpose: (i) Analyzing data from accelerometer sensing of hardware; (ii) Speech recognition; and (iii) Analyzing optical input. But most of these approaches require specific hardware. Some of them also requires extra physical effort that users are not used to. Gamer would feel more comfortable if there would exist better tools for gaming. Eye gaze estimation is the one of the most important HCI tool that is developing against to getting input from keyboard and mouse [2 - 4]. For eye gaze tracking systems; accuracy, tracking frequency and hardware dependencies are important issues. Since accuracy determines the feasibility of selection of targets such as images and buttons, is used for benchmarking of the eye gaze systems with the speed of the systems [5]. There are various techniques described in literature for eye gaze estimation. Nevertheless, a vast majority of those algorithms require additional special hardware and require manual initialization of pupils. On Witzner’s algorithm [6] the iris is modeled as an ellipse, but that technique requires high quality image that is taken very close from user’s eye. Some other systems described by Noureddin [7], Park [8] require visuals from two cameras with different angles. Snake algorithm of M. Kass [9] is also used for pupil detection. But it requires improvement on its very low accuracy. Williams [10] proposed an improvement to minimize energy functional of algorithm by using greedy algorithm technique, additional to this method Choi [11] propose an improved method for segmentation, after Lai [12] used multiple snakes to increase completeness of that method but since none of versions of snakes aren’t efficient in case to detect only pupils since those method aren’t specifically <b>aims</b> to find <b>circles.</b> Hough Transform method is improved by Marcin and Ingacy [13] to detect circles. In this method, image is first converted to binary image. Then circle equation with different radiuses is applied to every point to detect <b>circles.</b> Our <b>aim</b> is to develop a computer game controlled by low cost robust eye gaze tracking system and eye gesture detection algorithm by getting visual data from user by a simple webcam. In this paper, we have proposed a game which takes inputs from a video camera, by detecting the direction where user looking to, and detecting eye gestures for click functions. We have used webcam as video input device since it is easily accessible. We have tried to use the eye movements as the HCI (human computer interaction) tool, which would be used instead of a mouse. In general, this provides much easier and fast interaction with computer for everyone including old people, children and disabled people who cannot use mouse. We have also showed that eye tracking and eye gaze estimation can be very easy and fast way to obtain HCI. References 1.
