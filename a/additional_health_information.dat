40|$|Background: Lifestyle factors {{including}} inadequate {{physical activity}} {{may contribute to}} increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease in colorectal cancer survivors. Identification of the barriers to physical activity is important for forming an evidence base of factors to target in future physical activity programs aimed at improving cardiovascular health in this population. Methods: Colorectal cancer survivors (N = 24) from St. John of God Subiaco Hospital participated in semi-structured interviews about their current physical activity behaviors and perceived barriers to physical activity. Results: Inductive thematic analysis of interviews revealed 5 overarching themes relating to barriers to physical activity: psychological barriers, environmental barriers, knowledge of guidelines, lack of practitioner support, and energy/age barriers. Conclusions: Novel findings revealed participants' dependence on practitioner support, including a reliance on practitioners to recommend lifestyle change. Survivors also revealed that regular checkups to monitor cardiovascular risk replaced the need for healthy lifestyle changes. Implications: With survivors holding the advice of clinicians in high regard, an opportunity exists for clinicians to facilitate lifestyle change. Health care professionals such as nurses can implement motivational strategies and provide <b>additional</b> <b>health</b> <b>information</b> during follow-up visits, to ensure long-term adherence.

The work here focuses {{on the use of}} postural monitoring monitoring in safety critical missions such as explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) missions. The operatives undertaking these missions are commonly placed under a high level of physical and psychological strain due to the weight of the protective armoured suit and the importance of their work.

The system was able to recognise six specific postures (sitting, kneeling, crawling, and three variations of laying on the ground) with up to 100 % accuracy. However, due to limitations of the data processing method used, the system was unable to consistently distinguish between a subject standing, walking and running - an essential differentiation required by the application at hand. In order to counteract this limitation, a new prototype utilising additional sensors and an augmented data processing method has been implemented and evaluated and is reported here...|$|E

Material & methods: The Pharmacogenetics of Asthma medication in Children: Medication with Anti-inflammatory effects (PACMAN) study was initiated in April 2009 as an observational retrospective pharmacy-based study, including at least 1000 children with asthma medication (aged 4 - 12 years). Data on respiratory symptoms and medication use behavior will be collected using a questionnaire; complete medication histories will be extracted from the pharmacy information system; <b>additional</b> <b>health</b> <b>information</b> will be requested from the general practitioner; quality of inhalation technique and lung function measurements will be performed and saliva samples for DNA extraction and genotyping will be collected. Two groups of patients will be defined based on questionnaire data and lung function measurements: responders and nonresponders to anti-inflammatory asthma treatment. These two groups will be compared with respect to genetic variation. Corrections will be made for potential confounding factors. Results: The main study end point is treatment response, including asthma control, medication use and exhaled nitric oxide {{as a measure of}} airway inflammation. Whilst our focus is on genetic factors, this study allows us to also investigate other treatment response determinants, such as inhalation technique and therapy adherence.

This Pennsylvania resident had reportedly never been vaccinated against diphtheria. From October 3 - 10, this man and seven other men from New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia had worked in a rural village in Haiti. On return to Pennsylvania, the man was admitted to a hospital because of his severe sore throat and respiratory distress. Respiratory diphtheria was suspected when, during a tracheostomy procedure, a pseudomembrane was seen throughout his upper airways consistent with respiratory diphtheria. Several days later, {{a sample of the}} pseudomembrane was PC R positive for Corynebacterium diphtheriae tox genes. Based on his history of travel to Haiti where diphtheria is endemic, his clinical symptoms, and the positive PC R results, this patient has a confirmed case of respiratory diphtheria. Primary diphtheria immunization with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) is recommended for all persons aged 6 weeks to 6 years of age. The five DTaP doses are administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, at 15 - 18 months and at 4 - 6 years. Adolescents and adults should receive the adult formulation of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) every 10 years.

Therefore, {{the objective of the}} present study was to examine the association between alcohol consumption and incident MetS in a population of US men. This is a prospective study of 7483 Caucasian men, who were free of the MetS and CVD at baseline. Information was collected on alcohol consumption, health status and fitness level at an initial clinical examination. <b>Additional</b> <b>health</b> <b>information</b> and determination of incident cases of the MetS were obtained at follow-up clinical examinations between 1979 and 2005. Compared with non-drinkers, the multivariate hazard ratios of the MetS for light (1 – 3 drinks/week), moderate (4 – 7 drinks/week), moderate–heavy (8 – 13 drinks/week) and heavy (≥ 14 drinks/week) drinkers were 0 · 81 (95 % CI 0 · 68, 0 · 95), 0 · 68 (95 % CI 0 · 57, 0 · 80), 0 · 70 (95 % CI 0 · 59, 0 · 83) and 0 · 78 (95 % CI 0 · 66, 0 · 91), respectively. This association was seen across age groups, in men with one or more pre-existing MetS risk factors, and those with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2, and in all alcohol beverage types at most levels of alcohol consumption. An inverse dose–response association between alcohol consumption and low HDL concentrations was observed, while significant associations were observed between high fasting glucose concentrations and moderate, moderate–heavy and heavy levels of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption was not significantly associated with central obesity, hypertriacylglycerolaemia or hypertension. All levels of alcohol consumption provided significant inverse associations with incidence of the MetS. In particular, this effect was observed in overweight and/or obese individuals, in those who had pre-existing risk factors for the MetS, and extended across all types of alcoholic beverages consumed...|$|E

Background: The study was conducted in community primary healthcare centres located in the cities of Araçatuba and Coroados (state of São Paulo) and Rio de Janeiro (state of Rio de Janeiro), Brazil. Methods: The design was a qualitative, exploratory study. The purposeful sampling criteria were being female, with a minimum of three years of continuous service in the same location. Data collection with 62 participants was conducted via 11 focus groups (in 2007 and 2008). Audio files were transcribed and submitted to the method of thematic analysis. Four themes guided the analysis: working with qualitative information and undocumented observation; reflecting on qualitative information; integrating/analysing quantitative and qualitative information; and information-sharing with agents and family health teams. In 2010, 25 community health agents verified the final interpretation of the findings. Findings: Participants valued the recording of qualitative, contextual information to expand understanding of primary healthcare issues and as an indicator of clients’ improved health behaviour and health literacy. While participants initiated the recording of <b>additional</b> <b>health</b> <b>information,</b> they generally did not inform the family health team about these findings. They perceived that team members devalued this type of information by considering it a reflection of the clientele’s social conditions or problems beyond the scope of medical concerns.

40|$|Fruit juices {{offering}} {{health benefits}} beyond basic nutrition are nowadays highly valued among European consumers. Given its nutritional value and concomitant health benefits, açaí (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) may offer perspectives when aiming at satisfying health-related consumer needs and wants. The present study aims at examining {{to what extent}} health information changes consumer responses and acceptance of two açaí fruit juices that have a low versus a high a priori overall liking. Hedonic and sensory measures as well as health and nutritional-related attribute perceptions are rated {{before and after the}} presence of health information by consumers who are unfamiliar with açaí. Differences in information effects due to interactions with background attitudes (general health interest and food neophobia) and socio-demographic characteristics (age and gender) are investigated. Findings indicate that the effect of information on the juices’ overall acceptability, on consumers’ perceptions about the juices’ healthiness and nutritional value and on their purchase intention is positive, though rather small. This implies that juices, which are perceived to be intrinsically healthy, do not benefit a lot from providing <b>additional</b> <b>health</b> <b>information.</b> Furthermore, results show that consumers’ purchase behaviour is most notably driven by their sensory pleasure and less by the perceived health benefits: consumers in this study expressed their preference for the good-tasting açaí juice, although the least-liked one was perceived as being healthier and more nutritious in presence of the health information. Health information does not interact with consumer background attitudes. Though, this study confirms that background attitudes effectively matter in shaping consumers’ overall acceptability of both açaí fruit juices: health-oriented consumers were more likely to compromise on taste for a perceived health benefit, although they still preferred the best tasting juice, and consumers with a low food neophobia level evaluated the juices better on overall liking, taste and showed a higher purchase intention. Socio-demographics have a marginal influence, with older respondents and women being more likely to accept both açaí juices in presence of the health information...|$|E

40|$|Increased health {{consciousness}} and growing importance consumers attach to fruit {{in the diet}} lead to an increasing demand for various tropical fruits in Europe. Also food industries are making greater use of novel tropical fruits to meet the growing interest in innovations in healthy food products. The introduction of food products with novel tropical fruits in Europe can only be successful if consumers’ demand are taken into consideration. This PhD gains insight in perceptions and consumption behaviour among Belgian consumers towards tropical fruits that are not yet common on European markets. Findings indicate that consumers have a positive attitude towards tropical fruit consumption. Pleasure seeking, together with consumers’ beliefs that tropical fruits and their products are healthy, nutritious, special and attractive, form the major drivers. Taste is predominant, whereas unfamiliarity with tropical fruits and the perceived high acquisition prices form the main barriers for purchase and consumption. Tropical fruit juices are considered intrinsically healthy. Additional information about health-related benefits {{through the use of}} claims is not seen as a persuasive tool for their purchase. Nevertheless, claims seem to influence consumers’ behaviour, particularly when the ‘claim-carrier’ combination is optimal. Fruit juices with açaí may have a potential for successful commercialisation on the West-European market. Indications are the current trend of healthy eating habits, açaí’s nutritional properties, and the existence of processing industries and a well-developed market in the country of production. However, besides shortcomings on the supply side, unfamiliarity with açaí and its flavour, as well as the incomplete knowledge of its nutritional profile, may hamper its introduction. This research indicates that consumers may be willing to accept açaí fruit juices, but only up to a certain açaí concentration. Açaí fruit juices do not benefit much from providing <b>additional</b> <b>health</b> <b>information.</b> The findings indicate that purchase behaviour is most notably driven by sensory pleasure and less by perceived health benefits. The obtained findings are pertinent to different actors along the tropical fruit chain. The study stresses the importance for further research, focussing on 1) consumer segmentation, 2) familiarity, 3) nutrient profiles, 4) nutrition and health claims, and 5) sustainability issues...|$|E

40|$|Background: Web {{technology}} is increasingly {{being used to}} provide individuals with health risk assessments (HRAs) with tailored feedback. End-user satisfaction is an important determinant of {{the potential impact of}} HRAs, as this influences program attrition and adherence to behavioral advice. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate end-user satisfaction with a web-based HRA with tailored feedback applied in worksite settings, using mixed (quantitative and qualitative) methods. Methods: Employees of seven companies in the Netherlands participated in a commercial, web-based, HRA with tailored feedback. The HRA consisted of four components: 1) a health and lifestyle assessment questionnaire, 2) a biometric evaluation, 3) a laboratory evaluation, and 4) tailored feedback consisting of a personal health risk profile and lifestyle behavior advice communicated through a web portal. HRA respondents received an evaluation questionnaire after six weeks. Satisfaction with different parts of the HRA was measured on 5 -point Likert scales. A free-text field provided the opportunity to make additional comments. Results: In total, 2289 employees participated in the HRA program, of which 637 (27. 8 %) completed the evaluation questionnaire. Quantitative analysis showed that 85. 6 % of the respondents evaluated the overall HRA positively. The free-text field was filled in by 29. 7 % of the respondents (189 out of 637), who made 315 separate remarks. Qualitative evaluation of these data showed that these respondents made critical remarks. Respondents felt restricted by the answer categories of the health and lifestyle assessment questionnaire, which resulted in the feeling that the corresponding feedback could be inadequate. Some respondents perceived the personal risk profile as unnecessarily alarming or suggested providing more explanations, reference values, and a justification of the behavioral advice given. Respondents also requested the opportunity to discuss the feedback with a health professional. Conclusions: Most people were satisfied with the web-based HRA with tailored feedback. Sources of dissatisfaction were limited opportunities for providing <b>additional</b> <b>health</b> <b>information</b> outside of the predefined health and lifestyle assessment questionnaire and insufficient transparency on the generation of the feedback. Information regarding the aim and content of the HRA should be clear and accurate to prevent unrealistic expectations among end-users. Involving trusted health professionals in the implementation of web-based HRAs may enhance the use of and confidence in the HRA.

Similar to prior research, results of this study show that the majority of both online and offline <b>health</b> <b>information</b> seekers report reliance upon health care professionals as a source of <b>health</b> <b>information.</b> This study is unique in that the results illustrate that there are several key factors (age, income, and education) that discriminate between US online and offline <b>health</b> <b>information</b> seekers; this suggests that general "digital divide" characteristics influence where <b>health</b> <b>information</b> is sought. In addition to traditional digital divide factors, those who are healthier and happier are less likely to look exclusively offline for <b>health</b> <b>information.</b> Implications of these findings are discussed in terms of the digital divide and the patient-provider relationship. <b>Health</b> <b>information</b> seeking Internet Digital divide...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to explore the views of <b>health</b> <b>information</b> officers in processing and utilisation of mental <b>health</b> <b>information</b> within the context of primary health care. Fourteen <b>health</b> <b>information</b> officers were selected using purposive sampling techniques; they were interviewed, and data were grouped into themes. The study revealed a lack of structured information validation and feedback systems to improve the quality of information processing, and facility-level mental <b>health</b> <b>information</b> processing was fragmented and not used to improve service outcomes. Staff involved in <b>health</b> <b>information</b> recording and processing had limited skills to fulfill these tasks, and there were barriers to collecting and processing mental <b>health</b> <b>information.</b> These findings have major implications in improving mental health services within the integrated primary mental healthcare services, and in developing a sound and strong mental <b>health</b> <b>information</b> system.

Health Metrics Network (HMN) {{is the first}} global health partnership that focuses on strengthening a country’s <b>health</b> <b>information</b> system (HIS). Sri Lanka {{is one of the}} countries that are supported by HMN to strengthen the <b>health</b> <b>information</b> system. To do this HMN has developed a framework that provides a comprehensive approach to improving the <b>health</b> <b>information</b> system and has developed tools to assess and plan a country’s <b>health</b> <b>information</b> system. Sri Lankan National <b>Health</b> <b>Information</b> System was assessed using the <b>Health</b> <b>Information</b> System (HIS) assessment tool developed by the HMN. The assessments were conducted through national and provincial level stakeholder workshops and individual expert group interviews. The assessments identified gaps in the <b>health</b> <b>information</b> system in reference to HMN gold standards particularly in areas such as data management and resource available for the <b>health</b> <b>information</b> system. However in-depth analysis is needed to identify the gaps and the causes that contribute to it to develop a good <b>health</b> <b>information</b> systems strategic plan for Sri lanka...|$|R

Data from the 2012 <b>Health</b> <b>Information</b> National Trends Survey (HINTS) with n = 1, 270 was analyzed. A Chi-squared test of independence was performed to compare the characteristics of <b>health</b> <b>information</b> overload and nonhealth information overload. In addition, a logistic regression analysis was used to examine the possible correlation of the factors and <b>health</b> <b>information</b> overload. Using demographic variables as baseline, we found frustrated searching information, concerned electronic information, get attention from health professional, and doctor’s care were significant predictors of <b>health</b> <b>information</b> overload. An important finding of this analysis is the significant predictors of <b>health</b> <b>information</b> overload. In view of these factors, policy makers could provide an effective way to deliver <b>health</b> <b>information</b> when designing websites.
