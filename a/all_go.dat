5|$|Monarchs {{sometimes}} went {{to great}} lengths to prevent this. On her marriage to Louis XIV of France, Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip IV of Spain, was forced to renounce her claim to the Spanish throne. When monarchs or heirs apparent wed other monarchs or heirs, special agreements, sometimes in the form of treaties, were negotiated to determine inheritance rights. The marriage contract of Philip II of Spain and Mary I of England, for example, stipulated that the maternal possessions, as well as Burgundy and the Low Countries, were to pass to any future children of the couple, whereas the remaining paternal possessions (including Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan) would first of <b>all</b> <b>go</b> to Philip's son Don Carlos, from his previous marriage to Maria Manuela of Portugal. If Carlos were to die without any descendants, only then would they pass to the children of his second marriage. On the other hand, the Franco-Scottish treaty that arranged the 1558 marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots and Francis, the son and heir of Henry II of France, had it that if the queen died without descendants, Scotland would fall to the throne of France.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} Plautine stock character, {{discussed by}} K.C. Ryder, is the senex amator. A senex amator {{is classified as}} {{an old man who}} contracts a passion for a young girl and who, in varying degrees, attempts to satisfy this passion. In Plautus these men are Demaenetus (Asinaria), Philoxenus and Nicobulus (Bacchides), Demipho (Cistellaria), Lysidamus (Casina), Demipho (Mercator), and Antipho (Stichus). Periplectomenos (Miles Gloriosus) and Daemones (Rudens) are regarded as senes lepidi because they usually keep their feelings within a respectable limit. All of these characters have the same goal, to be with a younger woman, but <b>all</b> <b>go</b> about it in different ways, as Plautus could not be too redundant with his characters despite their already obvious similarities. What they have in common is the ridicule with which their attempts are viewed, the imagery that suggests that they are motivated largely by animal passion, the childish behavior, and the reversion to the love-language of their youth.|$|E
25|$|Madison, {{the lead}} {{supporter}} of the Constitution, was inhibited in replying to Henry's criticisms, since he was ill {{through most of the}} convention. Henry likely realized he was fighting a losing battle as sentiment in the convention moved towards ratification, but continued to speak at length and his speeches fill nearly one-quarter of the pages of the Richmond convention's debates. Governor Randolph, who had become a supporter of ratification, suggested that if the convention allowed Henry to continue arguing, it would last six months rather than six weeks. Henry was somewhat mollified, after the convention voted on June 21 to ratify the Constitution, {{by the fact that the}} convention then proposed about 40 amendments; some of them were later incorporated in the Bill of Rights. George Mason, Henry's ally in opposing ratification, intended a fiery diatribe on the faults of the new plan of government; he was talked out of it. By one account, Henry told other opponents that he had done his duty in opposing ratifications, and as republicans, with the issues settled in a democratic way, they had best <b>all</b> <b>go</b> home. Madison wrote to Washington that Henry still hoped for amendments to weaken the power of the federal government, possibly to be proposed by a second national convention.|$|E

500|$|The Strand is {{the subject}} of a famous music hall song [...] "Let's <b>All</b> <b>Go</b> Down the Strand", {{composed}} by Harry Castling and C. W. Murphy. The song opens with a group of tourists, staying the night at Trafalgar Square about to embark for Rhineland. The chorus of [...] "Let's <b>all</b> <b>go</b> down the Strand – have a banana" [...] is now recognised as a stereotypical part of Cockney music hall and parodied by English comedian Bill Bailey.
