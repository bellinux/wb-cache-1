The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to “brainwashing centres” <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>forms</b> of arbitrary detention. Petitioners likewise continue {{to be subjected to}} harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>forms</b> of arbitrary detention.
