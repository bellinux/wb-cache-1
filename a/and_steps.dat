5|$|By {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, the abbey, by then {{partially}} roofless and overgrown with trees and ivy, had become a famous ruin that attracted the attention of artists, dramatists and poets. In the nineteenth century, Netley became a popular tourist attraction (the novelist Jane Austen was among those who visited) <b>and</b> <b>steps</b> were taken to conserve the ruins. Archaeological excavations directed by Charles Pink and Reverend Edmund Kell took place in 1860. During the same period the owners decided to remove many of the Tudor additions to the building to create a more medieval feel to the site, resulting in the loss of much evidence of the abbey's post-Dissolution story.|$|E

5|$|Waves {{and high}} tides {{from the storm}} caused {{flooding}} along the Pamlico Sound side of Ocracoke and southern Hatteras Island. High tides also resulted in overwash in Pea Island, forcing the closure of Highway 12 due to 12inches (305mm) of salt water. High tides from the storm also destroyed two houses in South Nags Head and one in Rodanthe, two of which were previously condemned after the 1991 Perfect Storm. Three other houses in the Outer Banks were threatened by the storm.

5|$|Fortunately for {{the future}} of the Spitfire, many of the {{production}} jigs and machine tools had already been relocated by 20 September, <b>and</b> <b>steps</b> were being taken to disperse production to small facilities throughout the Southampton area. To this end, the British government requisitioned the likes of Vincent's Garage in Station Square Reading, which later specialised in manufacturing Spitfire fuselages, and Anna Valley Motors, Salisbury, which was to become the sole producer of the wing leading-edge fuel tanks for photo-reconnaissance Spitfires, as well as producing other components. A purpose-built works, specialising in manufacturing fuselages and installing engines, was built at Star Road, Caversham in Reading. The drawing office in which all Spitfire designs were drafted was relocated to Hursley Park, near Southampton. This site also had an aircraft assembly hangar where many prototype and experimental Spitfires were assembled, but since it had no associated aerodrome no Spitfires ever flew from Hursley.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Fairley {{received}} an appointment in London as Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Although he and Kellaway convinced the governors to delay Fairley's commencement until their major venom work was completed, he departed for London {{by the end}} of that year. He also opened a consulting practice in Harley Street. In London he encountered patients with filariasis and devised a test to diagnose the disease at an early stage; but when he went to write up his results he discovered that details of a similar test had already been published. In 1934, a sewer worker was referred to his ward with acute jaundice which Fairley diagnosed as caused by filariasis. The disease was revealed to be an occupational hazard of sewer workers, <b>and</b> <b>steps</b> were taken to protect the workers. Perhaps his most important work in this period was research into blackwater fever. Since malaria cases were uncommon in the United Kingdom, he made annual visits to the Malaria Research Laboratory of the League of Nations at the Refugee Hospital in Salonika. In the process, he described methaemalbumin, a previously unknown blood pigment. For his scientific accomplishments in London, Fairley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To investigate: (i) the intra-rater, inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities of {{completion}} times <b>and</b> <b>step</b> counts on the Standardized Walking Obstacle Course test (SWOC); (ii) correlations between SWOC scores and stroke-specific impairments; (iii) the cut-off SWOC completion times <b>and</b> <b>step</b> counts for distinguishing differences in obstacle negotiation ability {{in people with}} chronic stroke and healthy older adults. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University-based rehabilitation centre. Subjects: Twenty-nine people with stroke and 30 healthy older adults. Methods: SWOC completion times <b>and</b> <b>step</b> counts were measured under 3 conditions: (i) normal walking; (ii) walking with a tray; and (iii) walking with dark-glasses. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of lower extremity, the Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test, the Berg Balance Scale, the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), and the Community Integration Measure questionnaire, were also administered. Results: SWOC completion times <b>and</b> <b>step</b> counts showed very satisfactory to excellent reliabilities (intraclass correlation coefficient; ICC[*]=[*] 0. 851 – 0. 993). TUG times correlated significantly with SWOC completion times <b>and</b> <b>step</b> counts under the 3 conditions (r[*]=[*] 0. 586 – 0. 815, p[*]< 0. 001). SWOC completion times of 14. 73 – 16. 00 s <b>and</b> <b>step</b> counts of 23. 06 – 24. 13, depending on different walking conditions, were able to discriminate between stroke survivors and healthy older adults.

5|$|In {{response}} to the worsening security situation, William conducted his second northern campaign in 1069. He built another castle in York, on what is now Baile Hill {{on the west bank}} of the Ouse opposite the first castle, in an effort to improve his control over the city. This second castle was also a motte and bailey design, with the Baile Hill motte probably reached by a horizontal bridge <b>and</b> <b>steps</b> cut up the side of the motte. Later that year, a Danish Viking fleet sailed up to York along the Humber and the Ouse, and attacked both castles with the assistance of Cospatrick of Northumbria and a number of local rebels. The Normans, attempting to drive the rebels back, set fire to some of the city's houses. The fire grew out of control and also set fire to York Minster and, some argue, the castles as well. The castles were captured and partially dismantled, and Malet was taken hostage by the Danes.|$|E
5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree <b>and</b> <b>steps</b> in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the entrance, {{and running}} across {{the middle of the}} court, was the great hall of the castle, with a grand porch <b>and</b> <b>steps</b> leading up to the first floor, where prestigious guests would have been entertained amongst carved wall-panels and murals. The design of the hall may have {{emulated}} Gaunt's hall at Kenilworth; at the very least, it was a powerful symbol of Thomas's authority and status. The west side of the inner court included the castle kitchen, bakery, well and other service facilities; on the east side was the lord's great chamber and a range of other accommodation for other guests. Behind the great hall was a smaller courtyard or garden. Thomas appears to have built up his new castle in stages, with the curtain wall being built first, with the corner towers added afterwards.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} gait speed <b>and</b> <b>step</b> length on the {{required}} {{coefficient of friction}} (COF) confound the investigation of age-related differences in required COF. The goals {{of this study were}} to investigate whether age differences in required COF during self-selected gait persist when experimentally-controlling speed <b>and</b> <b>step</b> length, <b>and</b> to determine the independent effects of speed <b>and</b> <b>step</b> length on required COF. Ten young and 10 older healthy adults performed gait trials under five gait conditions: self-selected, slow and fast speeds without controlling <b>step</b> length, <b>and</b> slow and fast speeds while controlling step length. During self-selected gait, older adults walked with shorter <b>step</b> lengths <b>and</b> exhibited a lower required COF. Older adults also exhibited a lower required COF when walking at a controlled speed without controlling step length. When both age groups walked with the same speed <b>and</b> <b>step</b> length, no age difference in required COF was found. Thus, speed <b>and</b> <b>step</b> length can have a large influence on studies investigating age-related differences in required COF. It was also found that speed <b>and</b> <b>step</b> length have independent and opposite effects on required COF, with step length having a strong positive effect on required COF, and speed having a weaker negative effect.
