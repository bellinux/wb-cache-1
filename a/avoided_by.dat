5|$|Inbreeding {{depression}} {{occurs in}} the great tit (Parus major) when the offspring produced {{as a result of}} a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness. In natural populations of Parus major, inbreeding is <b>avoided</b> <b>by</b> dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative.|$|E
5|$|Some clock-shift {{problems}} could be <b>avoided</b> <b>by</b> adjusting clocks continuously {{or at least}} more gradually—for example, Willett at first suggested weekly 20-minute transitions—but this would add complexity {{and has never been}} implemented.|$|E
5|$|Unsuitable {{backyard}} {{fruit tree}} netting also kills many animals and may {{bring them into}} close contact with humans, but can be <b>avoided</b> <b>by</b> using wildlife-safe netting. Barbed wire may also lead to casualties; this can be ameliorated by removing old or unnecessary barbed wire or marking it with bright paint.|$|E

Larry questions the validity of losing his virginity to a prostitute, but the game resumes without a time limit.|$|E
5|$|Adolescence and adulthood: When rats forage {{on their}} own, their food choices are {{influenced}} by social interactions that may take place far away from foraging sites. They smell foods on the fur, whiskers and especially the breath of other rats and strongly prefer the foods those rats had previously eaten. This inclines them not to eat poisons <b>avoided</b> <b>by</b> older rats.|$|E
5|$|Bates {{put forward}} the {{hypothesis}} that the close resemblance between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation. He noted that some species showed very striking coloration, and flew in a leisurely manner, almost as if taunting predators to eat them. He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and were thus <b>avoided</b> <b>by</b> them. He extended this logic to forms that closely resembled such protected species, mimicking their warning coloration but not their toxicity.|$|E

5|$|Batesian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Henry W. Bates. When an edible prey animal comes to resemble, even slightly, a distasteful animal, natural selection favours those individuals that even very slightly better resemble the distasteful species. This is because {{even a small}} degree of protection reduces predation and increases the chance that an individual mimic will survive and reproduce. For example, many species of hoverfly are coloured black and yellow like bees, and are in consequence <b>avoided</b> <b>by</b> birds (and people).|$|E
5|$|During the Eastern Han, peasants {{could avoid}} {{the month of}} annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in {{commutation}} (gengfu 更賦). This development went {{hand in hand with}} the increasing use of hired labor by the government. In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be <b>avoided</b> <b>by</b> paying a tax in substitution.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{irritation}} can be <b>avoided</b> <b>by</b> cutting onions under {{running water}} or submerged in a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base {{has a higher}} concentration of sulphur compounds {{than the rest of}} the bulb. Refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the eyes. The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.|$|E

5|$|Players {{can avoid}} attacks from their opponents by dodging {{to the left}} or right or by ducking, but players cannot punch while dodging or ducking, nor can they duck body blows. They can also block attacks to either the head or the body, but they cannot block strong punches; strong punches must be <b>avoided</b> <b>by</b> dodging or ducking. Depending on the situation, the player must {{strategically}} block, dodge, or duck in order to avoid an opponent's attack. Players can capitalize on the opponent's attacks by launching counter-punches immediately after avoiding an attack.|$|E

5|$|The Falklands {{remained}} uninhabited {{until the}} 1764 establishment of Port Louis on East Falkland by French captain Louis Antoine de Bougainville, and the 1766 foundation of Port Egmont on Saunders Island by British captain John MacBride. Whether {{or not the}} settlements were aware of each other's existence is debated by historians. In 1766, France surrendered its claim on the Falklands to Spain, which renamed the French colony Puerto Soledad the following year. Problems began when Spain discovered and captured Port Egmont in 1770. War was narrowly <b>avoided</b> <b>by</b> its restitution to Britain in 1771.|$|E
5|$|The Patagonian {{tensions}} heightened in 1872 and 1878, when Chilean warships seized merchant {{ships which}} had been licensed {{to operate in the}} disputed area by the Argentine government. An Argentine warship did the same to a Chilean-licensed American ship in 1877. This action nearly led to war in November 1878, when the Argentines dispatched a squadron of warships to the Santa Cruz River. The Chilean Navy responded in kind, and war was only <b>avoided</b> <b>by</b> a hastily signed treaty.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{not fully}} {{understood}} how it came to his attention, Rochdale Town Hall was admired by Adolf Hitler. It has been suggested a visit by Hitler in 1912–13 while staying with his half-brother Alois Hitler, Jr. in Liverpool, or military intelligence on Rochdale, or information from Nazi sympathiser William Joyce (who had lived in Oldham), brought the building to his attention. Hitler admired the architecture {{so much that it}} is believed he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to Nazi Germany had German-occupied Europe encompassed the United Kingdom.

5|$|As initial {{contract}} negotiations {{failed in the}} off-season, Cloutier filed for arbitration on July 16, 2004. Arbitration was <b>avoided</b> <b>by</b> both sides when Cloutier agreed to a one-year, $3 million contract 11 days later. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, however, Cloutier spent the season mostly inactive until signing with EC KAC of the Austrian Hockey League on January 20, 2005. Replacing injured starter Andrew Verner, he appeared in 13 games with the Klagenfurt-based team, going undefeated with a 1.94 GAA. EC KAC finished the regular season second with the second-best record in the league. Cloutier appeared in 10 additional playoff games, recording a 2.75 GAA. EC KAC advanced to the finals, where they were defeated four-games-to-three by the Vienna Capitals.|$|E
5|$|Falls can be <b>avoided</b> <b>by</b> {{installing}} grab bars in {{bathrooms and}} handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top}} and bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E
