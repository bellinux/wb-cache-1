2500|$|When you {{get right}} down to it, Cain’s [...] plan is a 25 percent {{flat-rate}} consumption tax — not all that different from the FAIR tax that he says is his ultimate goal. This tax would be paid three times: first on wage income, again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> register as a sales tax, and yet again by businesses on their sales minus their cost of goods and services. For tax junkies, the first is a flat tax. The second is a retail sales tax and the third a business transfer tax. [...] But they are all consumption taxes.|$|E
2500|$|However, Transperth has {{maintained}} that the default fare is [...] "equal to the cash fare on the assumed basis that a passenger who has failed to tag off has travelled to the final destination of that particular bus, train or ferry service", and that the four-zone rate only applies to rail travel. During the implementation trial phase, the default fare was charged <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cash</b> Fare less the customer's discount based on how they last reloaded their card. With {{the opening of the}} Mandurah railway line, the default fare for travel on all train services was increased to a seven-zone fare, due to the ability of passengers to transfer trains without tagging off/on.|$|E

2500|$|Upon release, {{critical}} {{reaction to the}} album was almost universally positive, with Billboard magazine noting [...] "the group has successfully combined folk material with pop-dance beat arrangements. Pete Seeger's [...] "The Bells Of Rhymney" [...] {{is a prime example}} of the new interpretations of folklore." [...] In its July 1965 issue, Time magazine praised the album by stating [...] "To make folk music the music of today's folk, this quintet has blended Beatle beats with Lead Belly laments, created a halfway school of folk-rock that scores <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> box if not with the folk purists." [...] In the UK, the NME described the band and its debut album by commenting [...] "They look like a rock group but are really a fine folk unit. They play their stringed instruments with great skill and invention against the rock-steady drumming. [...] Their voices merge well...As the first group to bridge the gap between beat and folk, they deserve to be winners." [...] The UK publication Music Echo was also enthusiastic about the album's contents, concluding that the record was [...] "an album which easily lives up to the promise of their great knock-out singles." ...|$|E

No customers had, as yet, presented themselves.|$|E
