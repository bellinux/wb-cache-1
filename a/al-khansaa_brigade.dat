2500|$|The group's {{declaration}} of a caliphate has been criticised and its legitimacy has been disputed by Middle Eastern governments, other jihadist groups, and by Sunni Muslim theologians and historians. Qatar-based TV broadcaster and theologian Yusuf al-Qaradawi stated: [...] " [...] declaration {{issued by the}} Islamic State is void under sharia and has dangerous consequences for the Sunnis in Iraq and for the revolt in Syria", adding that the title of caliph can [...] "only be given by the entire Muslim nation", not by a single group. The group's execution of Muslims for breach of traditional sharia law while violating it itself (encouraging women to emigrate to its territory, travelling without a Wali—male guardian—and in violation of his wishes) has been criticised; as has its love of archaic imagery (horsemen and swords) while engaging in bid‘ah (religious innovation) in establishing female religious police (known as <b>Al-Khansaa</b> <b>Brigade).</b> In a similar vein, the Syrian Islamic scholar Muhammad al-Yaqoubi says, [...] "he followers of ISIS {{do not want to}} adhere to Islamic law but rather they want to twist Islamic law to conform to their fantasies. To this end, they pick and choose the evidences that corroborate their misguidance, despite being weak or abrogated." ...|$|E
50|$|ISIL’s {{fighters are}} {{reportedly}} organised into seven branches: infantry, snipers, air defence, special forces, artillery forces, the “army of adversity”, and the Caliphate Army. This force structure is largely replicated {{in each of}} its designated provinces, with the most skilled fighters and military strategists in each area serving in the special forces unit, which {{is not allowed to}} redeploy to other provinces. Parallel to this structure is the Caliphate Army, which is directed by ISIL’s central command rather than its provincial leadership. Made up overwhelmingly of foreign fighters, it is deployed to assist in battles across the Islamic State. There is also an all-female <b>Al-Khansaa</b> <b>Brigade</b> tasked with policing religious laws. According to battle reports, ISIL often operates in small mobile fighting units.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Al-Khansaa</b> <b>Brigade</b> (Arabic: لواء الخنساء), also spelled Al-Khanssaa Brigade, or {{otherwise}} colloquially {{referred to as}} Biters is an all-women police or religious enforcement unit of the extremist self-proclaimed jihadist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), operating in its de facto capital of Raqqa and Mosul. [...] Formed in early 2014 and apparently named after Al-Khansa, a female Arabic poet from {{the earliest days of}} Islam, it is unclear how widespread and sustained the group is. It is unique in the Muslim world where in other regimes with similar systems of religious police (such as Saudi Arabia) men enforce hisbah among women, and in the Islamic State has not spread outside of the capital Raqqa, leading one observer to wonder if it is a publicity [...] "stunt" [...] that will be “short-lived".|$|E
