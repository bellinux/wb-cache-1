500|$|Larwood {{has been}} widely {{acknowledged}} as the greatest fast bowler of his generation and, according to his Wisden obituary, was [...] "one of the rare fast bowlers in the game's long history to spread terror in opposition ranks by {{the mere mention of}} his name". Timing technology was primitive in his day, but various tests indicated speeds of between 90 and 100mph (140 to 160km/h). [...] Fingleton commented that Larwood was [...] "about twice as fast as <b>anyone</b> <b>out</b> there", indicating a match in progress at Trent Bridge. However, one Australian from an earlier cricketing generation, Ernie Jones, dismissed Larwood: [...] "He wouldn't knock a dint in a pound of butter on a hot day".|$|E
500|$|Mendelson {{called the}} trailer [...] "a {{textbook}} case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there <b>anyone</b> <b>out</b> there who watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, {{it looks good}} and all, but I need more evidence'?" [...] He added that he was [...] "a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal," [...] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the [...] "courage" [...] to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the [...] "Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz". Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven {{to go out to}} the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because it’s the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be." ...|$|E

[...] In doing so, Angel almost always gets Rockford in trouble, usually by involving him in hare-brained scams...often without Jim's knowledge, and never with his consent. [...] As often as not, Angel's antics result in Angel's, Jim's and/or others' arrests, and/or being placed on somebody's hit list. [...] In spite of this, Jim considers Angel {{as one of his}} best, if most exasperating, pals. [...] Towards {{the very end of the}} series, there is a noticeable cooling in Jim's attitude toward Angel in their often fractious relationship; however, the rift seems to have been repaired by the time of the reunion movies.|$|E

2500|$|On September 18, 2006, Allen and Webb debated {{each other}} at the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce. One of the more {{interesting}} aspects of this debate came when Allen was questioned by WUSA-TV anchor Peggy Fox. Fox said: [...] "It has been reported [...] your grandfather Felix, whom you were given your middle name for, was Jewish. Could you please tell us whether your forebears include Jews and, if so, at which point Jewish identity might have ended?" [...] This led to a booing from the crowd and anger from Allen who admonished Fox for [...] "making aspersions" [...] and responded: [...] "To be getting into what religion my mother is, I don't think is relevant...Why is that relevant -- my religion, Jim's religion or the religious beliefs of <b>anyone</b> <b>out</b> there?...My mother is French-Italian with a little Spanish blood in her."

60|$|And musing thus on {{the general}} {{inclination}} of our instincts towards injustice I met unexpectedly, {{at the turn of}} the road, as it were, a shape of duplicity. It might have been unconscious on Mrs Fyne's part, but her leading idea appeared to me to be not to keep, not to preserve her brother, but to get rid of him definitely. She did not hope to stop anything. She had too much sense for that. Almost <b>anyone</b> <b>out</b> of an idiot asylum would have had enough sense for that. She wanted the protest to be made, emphatically, with Fyne's fullest concurrence in order to make all intercourse for the future impossible. Such an action would estrange the pair for ever from the Fynes. She understood her brother and the girl too. Happy together, they would never forgive that outspoken hostility--and should the marriage turn out badly... Well, it would be just the same.
