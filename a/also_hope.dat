5|$|In recent years, {{in order}} to {{minimize}} labor costs in high production manufacturing, industrial welding has become increasingly more automated, most notably with the use of robots in resistance spot welding (especially in the automotive industry) and in arc welding. In robot welding, mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld and at first, spot welding was its most common application, but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances. Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials (such as steel and aluminum, for example) and new welding processes, such as friction stir, magnetic pulse, conductive heat seam, and laser-hybrid welding. Furthermore, progress is desired in making more specialized methods like laser beam welding practical for more applications, such as in the aerospace and automotive industries. Researchers <b>also</b> <b>hope</b> to better understand the often unpredictable properties of welds, especially microstructure, residual stresses, and a weld's tendency to crack or deform.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{recruits}} The Lone Gunmen to {{help him}} break into a high security research facility where he thinks he {{may be able to}} find more information on how to save Scully. Meanwhile, Skinner tries to deal directly with The Smoking Man for Scully's life, who tells him he will get back to him. Inside the facility, Mulder discovers that Dr. Scanlon works alongside several clones of Kurt Crawford. The clones show him Scully's harvested ova and tell him they are trying to save the abducted women's lives, since they acted as their birth mothers. They <b>also</b> <b>hope</b> to subvert the colonization project as an inside job. Mulder takes Scully's ova and leaves, being pursued by the Gray-Haired Man as he escapes. He returns to the hospital to see Scully, who tells him that Penny has died but that she intends to fight the disease. Afterward, Mulder phones Skinner for letting him know Scully's doing ok and may return to work soon, as well as for thanking him for his advice about not negotiating with the Smoking Man, after which Skinner and the Smoking Man come to terms on their deal in seclusion.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the stock delivery, an arm ball is delivered with rolling the fingers {{down the back of}} the ball on release. This means the ball has backspin on it, and it does not turn appreciably off the pitch. Instead, it travels straight on {{in the direction of the}} arm, from which it derives its name. However, by keeping the seam upright, the bowler can <b>also</b> <b>hope</b> to obtain some outswing away from the right-handed batsman, thereby confusing the batsman who expects the ball to turn.|$|E
25|$|Narcissi {{first started}} {{to appear in}} western art in the late middle ages, in panel paintings, {{particularly}} those depicting crucifixion. For instance there is a crucifixion scene by the Westfälischer Meister in Köln (c. 1415 – 1435) in the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne, where daffodils symbolise not only death but <b>also</b> <b>hope</b> in the resurrection, because they are perennial and bloom at Easter. Another example from this period is the altarpiece panel Noli me tangere from the Magdalenenkirche, Hildesheim Germany, by the Meister des Göttinger Barfüßeraltars (c. 1410). In {{the centre of the}} panel, between the hand of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, daffodils can be seen growing.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{investment}} in public transportation, however, {{has not changed}} the fact that San Juan is an automobile-reliant city and its fast growth has sparked urban sprawl. As of mid-2010, the government has approved plans for a redesign of this Puerto Rican city, featuring a new mass transit system, new roads and intersections, and more beach-access points. No cars will be allowed inside the oldest part of city (Old San Juan). The plans hope to remedy previous poor urban planning in the oldest section of the city, the Isleta, while curbing reliance on motor vehicles. The plans for redevelopment <b>also</b> <b>hope</b> to make the city more appealing {{in order to attract}} new residents, as San Juan has suffered from a shrinking population over the past 60 years.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{challenges}} in thermal therapy is delivering the appropriate amount of heat to the correct part of the patient's body. A great deal of current research focuses on precisely positioning heat delivery devices (catheters, microwave, and ultrasound applicators, etc.) using ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, {{as well as of}} developing new types of nanoparticles that make them particularly efficient absorbers while offering little or no concerns about toxicity to the circulation system. Clinicians <b>also</b> <b>hope</b> to use advanced imaging techniques to monitor heat treatments in real time—heat-induced changes in tissue are sometimes perceptible using these imaging instruments. In magnetic hyperthermia or magnetic fluid hyperthermia method, it will be easier to control temperature distribution by controlling the velocity of ferrofluid injection and size of magnetic nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|Although the Muslim {{army had}} {{the best of the}} early encounters, indiscipline on the part of {{tactical}}ly placed archers led to a tactical defeat for the Muslim army, with 75 Muslims killed. However, the Meccans failed to achieve their goal of destroying the Muslims completely. The Meccans did not occupy the town and withdrew to Mecca, since they were unable to attack Muhammad's position again, owing to military losses, low morale and the possibility of Muslim resistance in the town. There was <b>also</b> <b>hope</b> that Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy leading a group of Muslims in Medina could be won over by diplomacy. Following the defeat, Muhammad's detractors in Medina said that if the victory at Badr was proof of the genuineness of his mission, then the defeat at Uhud was proof that his mission was not genuine. Muhammad subsequently delivered Qur'anic verses 133-135 and 160-162 from the Al-i-Imran sura indicating that the loss, however, was partly a punishment for disobedience and partly a test for steadfastness.|$|E

500|$|The company's {{management}} and staff enjoy a close relationship.

As a result, instead of holding a press conference to explain the game to critics, they choose to invite people to play it in the studio. This practice allows them to see [...] "people leaving with a smile", enabling them to gauge the real reactions of players and to see whether the game is welcomed or not. They <b>also</b> <b>hope</b> that through early access, they can introduce their games to a wide audience, and share the experience with the community prior to the game's official launch.|$|E

500|$|... "Dead Man Walking" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Jessica Banov from FayObserver {{said that}} Body of Proof was finding its [...] "groove" [...] {{due to this}} episode, as well as highly praising Hendricks guest role, saying that [...] "guest stars like this should help keep up the quality". Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic also praised the episode, calling it [...] "one of its most entertaining episode's yet". She also praised the character development between Megan and Peter (Nicholas Bishop), as well as praising the partnership between Ethan and Curtis, saying that they [...] "made up for" [...] the fact Bud {{was not in the}} episode. She said, [...] "This partnership just keeps getting better and the visual {{of the two of them}} in bio-hazard suits was so comical. I look forward to more of these two as the show continues". She was also [...] "glad" [...] that Dr. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) had a bigger role, summarising that the [...] "character interaction sells this show". Like Banov, Orlando praised Hendricks guest role, saying it was [...] "lovely" [...] and that [...] "she and real life husband Geoffrey Arend had a sweet sort of chemistry". She <b>also</b> <b>hope</b> that Hendricks would reprise her role as Karen, stating that it would be [...] "wonderful".

She called it, [...] "Dramatic, but effective".|$|E
500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really {{think it was going}} to work out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and <b>also</b> <b>hope</b> not too– kind of like when I used to be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I {{have no idea what it}} really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really good at it. I have to look like I’ve been doing it a long time".|$|E
