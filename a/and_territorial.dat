5|$|Long-term field {{research}} has shown that range size, group size, social systems, <b>and</b> <b>territorial</b> behavior vary widely, and may be greatly affected by food distribution and quality. It is generally agreed that the ruffed lemur social system is multi-male/multi-female with a fission-fusion society, although some populations of black-and-white ruffed lemur have been reported as monogamous. This social flexibility is suspected to improve survivability despite an inflexible feeding ecology.|$|E
5|$|Many {{international}} law norms and customary practices {{developed in the}} inter-war years by the League of Nations are still in use today. The procedures for managing intrastate and inter-ethnic issues include international supervision, regional economic unions, minority protection, plebiscites, <b>and</b> <b>territorial</b> partition. The Palestine and Bosnian Partition Plans and European Union practice are modern examples of conditioning recognition of statehood on human rights, democracy, and minority protection guarantees.|$|E

5|$|The National Register of Electors is updated {{to reflect}} various {{changes in the}} Canadian population, {{including}} address changes, reaching voting age, naturalisation, and death. Every year, about 3,000,000 address changes are processed by Elections Canada from information obtained from the Canada Revenue Agency, Canada Post, provincial <b>and</b> <b>territorial</b> motor vehicle registrars, and provincial electoral agencies with permanent voters lists. Every year, about 400,000 Canadians reach voting age and 200,000 Canadians die, resulting in changes to the National Register of Electors based on information obtained from the Canada Revenue Agency, provincial <b>and</b> <b>territorial</b> motor vehicle registrars, and provincial electoral agencies with permanent voters lists. Additionally, 120,000 individuals a year become naturalised Canadians, and {{are added to the}} National Register of Electors by Elections Canada based on information obtained from Citizenship and Immigration Canada. Collectively, these represent about 20% of the entries in the National Register of Electors.|$|E

5|$|A {{coalition}} Government of National Union {{was installed}} {{in the capital of}} Vientiane, but it soon ran into difficulties. By the 2 October 1962 deadline for the removal of foreign troops, the North Vietnamese had pulled out only 40 personnel, leaving approximately 6,000 troops in the eastern half of the country. Meanwhile, rightist elements (in control of the army) opposed the new government. The U.S. played its part by increasing its assistance to the right by covertly supplying the army through Thailand. Despite another international accord, Laos remained ensnared by the political <b>and</b> <b>territorial</b> ambitions of communist neighbors, the security concerns of Thailand and the United States, and geographic fate.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1955, {{the number}} of day schools run by Indian Affairs {{expanded}} from 9,532 to 17,947. The growth in day schools was accompanied by {{an amendment to the}} Indian Act in 1951 that allowed federal officials to establish agreements with provincial <b>and</b> <b>territorial</b> governments and school boards regarding the education of Indigenous students in the public school system. These changes were indicative of the government's shift in policy from assimilation-driven education at residential schools to the integration of Indigenous students into public schools.
