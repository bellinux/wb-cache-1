5|$|Coleridge {{began writing}} The Eolian Harp on 20 August 1795 during his {{engagement}} to Sara Fricker. Like his previous poem Lines Written at Shurton Bars, the poem discusses both his engagement and his future marriage. Coleridge {{was inspired to}} write the poem after {{a visit to a}} house in Clevedon that would serve as his and Fricker's home after their marriage. As Coleridge worked on the poem, he and Fricker were married <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>moved</b> to the Clevedon home. During this time, Coleridge held an idealised view of his life with Fricker, and these thoughts work their way into the poem. The poem was published in the 1796 edition of Coleridge's poems and in all subsequent collections. Of his poems for the 1796 collection, Coleridge felt that The Eolian Harp was his favourite.|$|E
5|$|De Barth {{was born}} November 1, 1764, {{in the town}} of Munster, in Alsace, France. He {{was the son of a}} French nobleman, Jean Joseph de Barth, and his wife, Marie Louisa de Rohme.

After attending a Premonstratensian college in Belgium, he enrolled in a seminary in Strasbourg and was ordained there in 1790. The French Revolution forced many noble families into exile, including de Barth's, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>moved</b> to the United States in 1791. De Barth renounced his titles and presented himself to John Carroll, the bishop of Baltimore, for service as a secular priest. Initially, he worked at Bohemia Manor as an assistant priest; shortly thereafter, he was relocated to Port Tobacco, Maryland.|$|E

In the {{following}} year Emanuel Lasker's patron, Krylenko, was purged. Lasker tried to support himself by giving chess and bridge lectures and exhibitions, as he was now too old for serious competition. In 1940 he published his last book, The Community of the Future, in which he proposed solutions for serious political problems, including anti-Semitism and unemployment.

Aged three, {{business}} failure hit the family, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>moved</b> to Marrickville in inner Sydney. The family's poor financial position meant that {{they lived in a}} one-bedroom home, with Brown and his brother sharing a bed. Educated at Dulwich Hill and Petersham High Schools in Sydney, Brown started playing cricket as a wicket-keeper, before changing his focus to opening the batting. He left high school after two years, but was unable to find regular full-time work amid the Great Depression.
