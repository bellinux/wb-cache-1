5|$|A. Keene Richard was {{the first}} American known to have {{specifically}} bred Arabian horses. He traveled to the desert in 1853 and 1856 to obtain breeding stock, which he crossed on Thoroughbreds, and also bred purebred Arabians. Unfortunately, his horses were lost during the Civil War <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> known purebred Arabian descendants today. Another major U.S. political figure, William H. Seward purchased four Arabians in Beirut in 1859, prior to becoming Secretary of State to Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{are currently}} rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting blast furnaces are much shorter than iron blast furnaces and are rectangular in shape. The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m. Modern lead blast furnaces {{are constructed using}} water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> refractory linings in the side walls. The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory). Lead blast furnaces are often open-topped rather than having the charging bell used in iron blast furnaces.|$|E

5|$|In {{assessing}} Beecher's legacy, Applegate {{states that}} His reputation has been eclipsed {{by his own}} success.

5|$|Jean-Baptiste Morain, {{writing in}} Les Inrockuptibles, noticed how the strong {{do not accept}} their own {{weakness}} <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> qualms about perpetuating an injustice to defend their interests. This wider political sense is, he argued, accentuated by its English setting, where class differences are more marked than in the USA. The film pits passion and the dream of happiness against ambition and arrivisme, resolving the dispute with a pitiless blow that disallows all chance of justice.|$|E
5|$|Kali is a winch {{operator}} at {{a village}} power plant. Although a reputed troublemaker, he occasionally does good deeds {{for the local}} community.

When a poor wanderer named Manga and her aged mother arrive in the village with no assets and no-one to assist them, Valli helps them set up their home in the village.

Papulae are plentiful on their aboral surface and they possess marginal plates and paxillae. They mostly inhabit soft-bottomed areas of sand or mud. There is no brachiolaria stage in their larval development. The comb starfish (Astropecten polyacanthus) {{is a member}} of this order.|$|E
5|$|Today {{some of the}} McAuleys (and other various spellings of the name) {{living in}} Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland descend from Clan MacAulay (of Ardincaple).

5|$|Along with cougars, timber wolves are {{the largest}} top predators {{that live in the}} forest <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> predators of their own except humans. Most of the area's native mammal species are present in the forest, with the {{exception}} of grizzly bears, which have become locally extinct. Plans for their reintroduction to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s, but have not progressed because of concerns similar to those with the wolf reintroduction as well as fears for human safety. The northern and high elevation areas of the forest contain habitat for wolverines and the endangered Canadian lynx, but no recent sightings of these species have been reported.|$|E

5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, the striped {{burrowing}} frog (Cyclorana alboguttata) regularly aestivates during the hot, dry season in Australia, surviving in a dormant state {{without access to}} food and water for nine or ten months of the year. It burrows underground and curls up inside a protective cocoon formed by its shed skin. Researchers at the University of Queensland have found that during aestivation, the metabolism of the frog is altered and the operational efficiency of the mitochondria is increased. This means that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner. This survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious {{for an extended period}} of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold-blooded <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> need to generate heat. Other research showed that, to provide these energy requirements, muscles atrophy, but hind limb muscles are preferentially unaffected. Frogs have been found to have upper critical temperatures of around 41 degrees Celsius.|$|E
5|$|In general, Uyghurs and {{the mostly}} Han {{government}} disagree on which group has greater historical {{claim to the}} Xinjiang region: Uyghurs believe their ancestors were indigenous to the area, whereas government policy considers present-day Xinjiang to have belonged to China since around 200BC. According to PRC policy, Uyghurs are classified as a National Minority rather than an indigenous group—in other words, they {{are considered to be}} no more indigenous to Xinjiang than the Han, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> special rights to the land under the law. The People's Republic has presided over the migration into Xinjiang of millions of Han, who dominate the region economically and politically.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E

5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or eelgrass, but where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marsh contains glassworts and annual seablite in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh here, although they are uncommon in the UK away from the Norfolk coast.|$|E

Where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marshes contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The uncommon spiral tasselweed and long-bracted sedge are other lower salt marsh specialists. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh, although they are uncommon in the UK away from this coast. They may occur alongside scarce species including lesser centaury, curved hard-grass and sea pearlwort, with soft hornwort in the dykes.|$|E
5|$|The double {{burden that}} single mothers endure has a {{historical}} precedent, and still exists currently. Single mothers usually have {{higher rates of}} employment and children at home, and have the highest levels overall of the double burden. Women also typically have less economic resources than men, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> partner to share the workload with them. Single mothers fall heavily under economic vulnerability. They may face job discrimination and not earn as much, {{so there will be}} further difficulties in maintaining the double burden. Single-mother families tend to hover near the poverty line, with a poverty rate that is twice as high of that for men.|$|E
