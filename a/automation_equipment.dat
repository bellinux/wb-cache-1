25|$|Floppy disks {{are used}} for {{emergency}} boots in aging systems lacking support for other bootable media and for BIOS updates, since most BIOS and firmware programs can still be executed from bootable floppy disks. If BIOS updates fail or become corrupt, floppy drives can sometimes be used to perform a recovery. The music and theatre industries still use equipment requiring standard floppy disks (e.g. synthesizers, samplers, drum machines, sequencers, and lighting consoles). Industrial <b>automation</b> <b>equipment</b> such as programmable machinery and industrial robots {{may not have a}} USB interface; data and programs are then loaded from disks, damageable in industrial environments. This equipment may not be replaced due to cost or requirement for continuous availability; existing software emulation and virtualization do not solve this problem because no operating system is present or a customized operating system is used that has no drivers for USB devices. Hardware floppy disk emulators can be made to interface floppy-disk controllers to a USB port {{that can be used for}} flash drives.|$|E

40|$|The coming era of {{personalized}} {{cancer treatment}} is presenting automation with unprecedented opportunities. Currently, the drug susceptibility test of clinical cancer patients is mainly dependent on manual labor {{with a low}} level of automation. Automating the process of primary cancer cell detection will potentially have tremendous economic benefits and social significance. Automated cancer cell detection means developing robotic and <b>automation</b> <b>equipments</b> to handle single cells and molecules at the micro/nanometer-scale. The achievements of information science, engineering technology, life sciences, and nanotechnology in the past decades have led to the birth of robots that can perform effective manipulations on single living cells at the micro/nanometerscale in aqueous conditions, opening the door to automated cancer cell detection. However, there is still a huge gap between current single-cell micro/nano automation technology and clinical requirements for personalized medicine. In this paper, we will review the progress of single-cell micro/nano automation technology in recent years and discuss the facing challenges and future directions in three aspects, including automated cell isolation and delivery, automatically acquiring the physiological features of cells and data analysis...|$|R
