500|$|The {{witty and}} playful side of Creangă's personality, which became notorious {{during his time}} at Junimea and {{constituted}} {{a significant part of}} his appeal, was reflected into a series of anecdotes. These accounts detail his playing the ignorant in front of fellow Junimists in order not to antagonize sides during literary debates (notably, by declaring himself [...] "for against" [...] during a two-option vote), his irony in reference to his own admirers (such as when he asked two of them to treasure the photograph of himself in the middle {{and the two of them}} on either side, while comparing it to the crucifixion scene and implicitly assigning them the role of thieves), and his recourse to puns and proverbs which he usually claimed to be citing from oral tradition and the roots of Romanian humor. The latter habit was notably illustrated by his answer to people who would ask him for money: [...] "not since I born was I as poor as I was poor yesterday and the day before yesterday <b>and</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> and throughout life". His joyfulness complemented his overall Epicureanism and his gourmand habits: his accounts are often marked by a special interest in describing acts related to food and drink. Overall, Eduard Gruber's report contended, Creangă's writing relied on him being [...] "a strong sensual and auditive type", and a [...] "very emotional" [...] person.|$|E
