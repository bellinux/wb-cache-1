This settled the doubtful matter. Had the hive of these bees been BEYOND that wood, the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>intersection</b> would not have been there, but at the hive across the prairie. The reader will understand that creatures which obey an instinct, or such a reason as bees possess, would never make a curvature in their flights without some strong motive for it. Thus, two bees taken from flowers that stood half a mile apart would be certain not to cross each other's tracks, in returning home, until they met at the common hive: and wherever the intersecting angle in their respective flights may be, there would that hive be also. As this repository of sweets was the game le Bourdon had in view, {{it is easy to see}} how much he was pleased when the direction taken by the last of his bees gave him the necessary assurance that its home would certainly be found in that very point of dense wood.|$|E
60|$|The {{stratification}} of the clay-slate {{is generally}} very obscure, whereas the cleavage is remarkably well defined: {{to begin with}} the extreme eastern parts of Tierra del Fuego; the cleavage-planes near the St. of Le Maire strike either W. and E. or W.S.W. and E.N.E., and are highly inclined; the form of the land, including Staten Island, indicates that the axes of elevation have run in this same line, though I was unable to distinguish the planes of stratification. Proceeding westward, I accurately examined the cleavage of the clay-slate on the northern, eastern, and western sides (thirty-five miles apart) of Navarin Island, and everywhere found the laminae ranging with extreme regularity, W.N.W. and E.S.E., seldom varying more than one point of the compass from this direction. (The clay-slate in this island was in many places crossed by parallel smooth joints. Out of five cases, the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>intersection</b> between the strike of these joints and that of the cleavage-laminae was in two cases 45 degrees and in two others 79 degrees.) Both on the east and west coasts, I crossed at right angles the cleavage-planes for a space of about eight miles, and found them dipping at an angle of between 45 degrees and 90 degrees, generally to S.S.W., sometimes to N.N.E., and often quite vertically. The S.S.W. dip was occasionally succeeded abruptly by a N.N.E. dip, and this by a vertical cleavage, or again by the S.S.W. dip; as in a lofty cliff on the eastern end of the island the laminae of slate were seen to be folded into very large steep curves, ranging in the usual W.N.W. line, I suspect that the varying and opposite dips may possibly be accounted for by the cleavage- laminae, though to the eye appearing straight, being parts of large abrupt curves, with their summits cut off and worn down.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} an autonomous system of partial differential equations for a one-dimensional distributed medium with periodic boundary conditions. Dynamics in time consists of alternating {{birth and death}} of patterns with spatial phases transformed from one stage of activity to another by the doubly expanding circle map. So, the attractor in the Poincaré section is uniformly hyperbolic, a kind of Smale –Williams solenoid. Finite-dimensional models are derived as ordinary differential equations for amplitudes of spatial Fourier modes (the 5 D and 7 D models). Correspondence of the reduced models to the original system is demonstrated numerically. Computational verification of the hyperbolicity criterion is performed for the reduced models: the distribution <b>of</b> <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>intersection</b> for stable and unstable manifolds on the attractor is separated from zero, i. e., the touches are excluded. The example considered gives a partial justification for the old hopes that the chaotic behavior of autonomous distributed systems {{may be associated with}} uniformly hyperbolic attractors...|$|R

When the Poggendorff's rectangle is demarcated by subjective contours, the illusion remains.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new multiscale finite element method which is able to accurately capture solutions of elliptic interface problems with high contrast coefficients by using only coarse quasiuniform meshes, and without resolving the interfaces. A typical application would be the modelling of flow in a porous medium containing a number of inclusions of low (or high) permeability embedded in a matrix of high (respectively low) permeability. Our method is H- 1 - conforming, with degrees of freedom at the nodes of a triangular mesh and requiring the solution of subgrid problems for the basis functions on elements which straddle the coefficient interface but which use standard linear approximation otherwise. A key point is the introduction of novel coefficient-dependent boundary conditions for the subgrid problems. Under moderate assumptions, we prove that our methods have (optimal) convergence rate of O(h) in the energy norm and O(h(2)) in the L- 2 norm where h is the (coarse) mesh diameter and the hidden constants in these estimates are independent of the "contrast" (i. e. ratio of largest to smallest value) of the PDE coefficient. For standard elements the best estimate in the energy norm would be O(h(1 / 2 -epsilon)) with a hidden constant which in general depends on the contrast. The new interior boundary conditions depend {{not only on the}} contrast of the coefficients, but also on the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>intersection</b> <b>of</b> the interface with the element edges...|$|R
