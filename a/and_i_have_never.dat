500|$|In 1912, when Olivier was five, {{his father}} secured a {{permanent}} appointment as assistant priest at St Saviour's, Pimlico. He held the post for six years, and a stable family life was at last possible. Olivier {{was devoted to}} his mother, but not to his father, whom he found a cold and remote parent. Nevertheless, he {{learned a great deal}} of the art of performing from him. As a young man Gerard Olivier had considered a stage career and was a dramatic and effective preacher. Olivier wrote that his father knew [...] "when to drop the voice, when to bellow about the perils of hellfire, when to slip in a gag, when suddenly to wax sentimental... The quick changes of mood and manner absorbed me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> forgotten them." ...|$|E
500|$|Rosas's {{authority}} and influence spread {{far beyond the}} House of Representatives. He exercised tight control over the bureaucracy {{as well as his}} cabinet, stating: [...] "Do not imagine that my Ministers are anything but my Secretaries. I put them in their offices to listen and report, and nothing more." [...] His supporters were rewarded with positions within the state apparatus, and anyone he deemed a threat was purged. Opposition newspapers were burned in public squares. Rosas created an elaborate cult of personality, presenting himself as an almighty and fatherlike figure who protected the people. His portraits were carried in street demonstrations and placed on church altars to be venerated. Rosismo was no longer a mere faction within the Federalist ranks; it had become a political movement. As early as 1829, Rosas had confided to an Uruguayan diplomatic envoy: [...] "I tell you I am not a Federalist, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> belonged to that party." [...] During his governorship, he still claimed to have favoured Federalism against Unitarianism, although in practice Federalism had by that time been subsumed into the Rosismo movement.|$|E

500|$|Van Leer's only {{comment to}} the media came on Saturday, December 3, 1955: [...] "I am 60 years old <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> broken a contract. I {{do not intend to}} start now". At a tense meeting of the Board of Regents on Monday, it was decided that Georgia Tech would be allowed to play in the Sugar Bowl. The new policy was that [...] "all laws, customs and traditions of host states would be {{respected}} but all games played in Georgia would be segregated", a policy that would remain until 1963. The regents, with the exception of Tech alumnus David Rice, condemned the [...] "riotous" [...] behavior of Tech students. Rice instead criticized Marvin Griffin, and was lauded by The Technique as the [...] "only man with the moral conviction to stand up against Griffin,... and co". Ironically, Tech defeated Pittsburgh 7–0 because of a pass interference call on the black player. Van Leer died six weeks after this incident, on January 23, 1956; the stress of the controversy was believed to have shortened his life.|$|E
500|$|The poem {{discusses}} {{his understanding}} of nature within the concept of [...] "One Life", an idea that {{is presented as a}} resulting from Coleridge's reflection on his experiences at Clevedon. The conversation poems as a whole are connected to the ideas within The Eolian Harp that deal with understanding the universe. The [...] "One Life" [...] lines added to the 1817 edition interconnect the senses and also connects sensation and experience of the divine with the music of the Aeolian harp. Although the earlier editions do not include the same understanding of perception, there traces of the idea expressed in the earlier editions. Coleridge derived his early understanding from the works of Jakob Böhme, of which he wrote in a 4 July 1817 letter to Ludwig Tieck: [...] "Before my visit to Germany in September, 1798, I had adopted (probably from Behmen's Aurora, which I had conjured over at School) the idea, that Sound was = Light under the praepotence of Gravitation, and Color = Gravitation under the praepotence of Light: <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> seen reason to change my faith in this respect." [...] Along with this view of sensation, Coleridge adopted Böhme's idea of connecting to God through the will instead of the intellect, and that pantheism should be denied. Coleridge also relies in part on Böhme's understanding of polarity of opposites in his own views of Polar Logic and man's attempt to return to Paradise.|$|E
500|$|On December 14, 2012, {{academic}} and writer Judith Reisman stated {{in a piece}} for WorldNetDaily that in her view Wales had received revenue from a website which dealt in pornography. Relatively soon after the article was published, Wales wrote to WorldNetDaily to object to this characterization: [...] "This is absolutely and categoricallly [...] false. I have never made any 'fortune', as a pornography trafficker or otherwise, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been a 'pornography trafficker' at all. ... I demand an immediate edit to that story to remove the lie about me." [...] WorldNetDaily editor Joseph Farah personally replied to Wales to explain that Wikipedia's coverage {{of the history of}} Bomis acknowledged at the time that: [...] "Bomis ran a website called Bomis Premium at premium.bomis.com until 2005, offering customers access to premium, X-rated pornographic content." [...] Wales sent an email to Farah stating Wikipedia: [...] "doesn't say anything remotely like me making a 'fortune' from 'pornography." [...] Wales inquired to Farah {{what he was going to}} do next about what Wales characterized as [...] "libel". Farah responded to Wales' reply with a subsequent email asking: [...] "Let me get this straight: You admit making money from pornography, but you feel defamed because you didn’t make enough for it to be considered a 'fortune'?" [...] Wales then repeated his original request to Farah and again asserted the original article was [...] "defamatory", writing in an email: [...] "This is a defamatory falsehood. I have never made any 'fortune' as a 'porngraphy [...] trafficker.' Fix it." ...|$|E

500|$|Some campaigning by party {{workers of}} the True Finns caused {{controversy}} over {{the nature of their}} actions. Most complaints emanated from the Helsinki region. Jussi Saramo of the Left Alliance in the Uusimaa electoral district said of their actions that [...] " [...] I have been involved in politics for 12 years <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> seen such excesses." [...] This followed an event in Korso in Vantaa where he parked his campaign trailer in a spot the True Finns said was reserved for party chairman Timo Soini. True Finns' candidate Mika Niikko however said those involved in the spat were no longer working for his campaign and he apologised to Saramo despite maintaining his stance that the placement of the trailer was a deliberate provocation: [...] "I do not approve of being provoked when someone tries to provoke;" [...] he also added that the volunteers working for the True Finns campaign come [...] "from here and there" [...] and {{it was not possible to}} verify everyone beforehand. He further added a claim that True Finns supporters have also been targets of aggressive behaviour. [...] "A month ago we were not verbally abused, but now you can hear all kinds of language." [...] The Social Democrats' foreign-born candidate Ranbir Sodhi was allegedly confronted by True Finns supporters in the Myyrmäki district of Vantaa who were said to have told him to go back [...] "to his own country" [...] where he could become a politician. A week after the confrontations, however, he said that [...] "the same guys came to Tikkurila to apologise." [...] The National Coalition Party MP Raija Vahasalo also complained that during a campaign event in Kirkkonummi the True Finns handed out leaflets at the same time that claimed she favoured Swedish-speaking residents in allocating local school funding. The action was due to two local members of the True Finns who are not running to become MPs. The chairman of Kirkkonummi True Finns and a candidate in the election Pekka Sinisalo said he confiscated the remainder of the leaflets. [...] "I do not approve of attacking Vahasalo’s person. Election fever sometimes leads to these kinds of excesses." [...] This was controversial as negative campaigning is unusual in Finnish elections. In response to such actions the party secretaries of the largest political parties held a meeting to discuss certain ground rules for the rest of the campaign, however the True Finns' Ossi Sandvik could not make it.|$|E
500|$|The 1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships {{were held}} in August at Sydney Olympic Park, and were viewed as a {{rehearsal}} for the 2000 Summer Olympics {{to be held in}} the same venue. With Thorpe expected to deliver world records at his first international meet in Sydney, the event was shown live on Australian television for the first time. The opening night saw him pitted against Hackett and South Africa's Ryk Neethling in the 400m freestyle final. The trio reached the 200m mark in a group, on world record pace, before Thorpe broke away, recording a split time 1.86s ahead of world-record pace at 300m. He extended his lead to four body lengths by the 350m mark and finished in a time of 3min 41.83s, cutting almost two seconds from the world record, and covering the second half in almost {{the same time as the}} first. Talbot reacted to the performance by dubbing Thorpe as [...] "the greatest swimmer we've [...] ever had", whilst four-time American Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines, commentating for NBC, said [...] "...he went into a balls-out sprint at 250– <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> seen anything like that...I have been around swimming a long time and it's the most amazing swim I've ever seen, hands down." [...] A formula used by the International Swimming Statisticians Association to compare world records in different events gave his performance the highest score of all current world records. Thorpe promptly donated the A$25,000 prizemoney for breaking the first world record in the pool to charity. Later the same night, Thorpe anchored the Australians to a historic victory in the 4×100m freestyle final, the first time the United States had lost the event. Thorpe set an Australian record relay split of 48.55s. Even taking into account a 0.6–0.7s for a flying relay start, his split time was almost 1s faster than his individual best of 49.98s. It was to be the first of many occasions in which he would anchor the Australian relay teams to victory over the Americans, with splits consistently faster than his equivalent individual times. The following night, in the semi-finals of the 200m freestyle, Thorpe broke Hackett's world record by 0.33s, clocking 1min 46.34s. The next day in the final, he again broke the record, lowering it to 1min 46.0s. He finished his competition by leading off the 4×200m freestyle team with Klim, Hackett and Bill Kirby to victory. Their time lowered their own world record by more than three seconds, completing Thorpe's fourth world record in four nights.|$|E
