5|$|The {{eighteenth century}} book {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} letters and essays written by Franklin. Most of the 25 letters in the collection were to Collinson. Some had personal content, but most were about his experiments with electricity <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> observed from them. These talked about the conclusions he came to after doing scientific experimentation on Leyden jars and lightning storm clouds. He many times related the similarities of how each of these acted and that the principles they followed were identical. This connection ultimately led Franklin to the lightning rod and that the electricity could be diverted harmlessly away from houses and wooden buildings - making it a protection device.|$|E
25|$|The {{form of the}} {{covenant}} resembles the suzerainty treaty in the ancient Near East. Like the treaties, the Ten Commandments begins with Yahweh's identification <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done for Israel ("who brought {{you out of the}} land of Egypt"; Ex 20:2) as well as the stipulations commanding absolute loyalty ("You shall not have other gods apart from me"). Unlike the suzerainty treaty, the Decalogue does not have any witness nor explicit blessings and curses. The fullest account of the Mosaic covenant is given in the book of Deuteronomy.|$|E
25|$|In February 1936, {{when the}} first Hall of Fame {{election}} results were announced, Cobb had been named on 222 of 226 ballots, outdistancing Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson, the only others to earn the necessary 75% of votes to be elected that first year. His 98.2 percentage stood as the record until Tom Seaver received 98.8% {{of the vote in}} 1992. Those incredible results show that although many people disliked him personally, they respected the way he had played <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> accomplished. In 1998, Sporting News ranked him as third on the list of 100 Greatest Baseball Players.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{initially}} pleading {{not guilty}} to the remaining five murder charges on September 13, 1988, with the agreement of his two defense attorneys, Berdella ultimately conducted a plea bargain with the prosecutors to avoid {{the death penalty in}} these remaining charges. In this plea bargain, Berdella agreed to confess in graphic detail as to precisely whom he had killed, precisely what indignities he had subjected each victim to, how he had killed each victim, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done with their bodies. These confessions were given to prosecutors between December 13 and December 15, 1988. In return for his cooperation, the prosecution agreed not to seek the death penalty at a formal hearing scheduled for 9 a.m on December 19.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though he}} used over sixty mules, he knew to the item what {{each of them}} carried, where they were being {{delivered}} to <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to charge. And although he ran mule trains for over half a century he never lost a pound of cargo, except in one instance when his secundo, upon smelling a two-pound package of Limburger Cheese, decided it was rotten and threw it away. Once aware of the error, Cataline made sure it was replaced and delivered. One of the best stories about him involves a loan {{that he had to}} make after a fatal disease had killed several of his mules. The bank manager questioned Cataline's collateral, wondering how many mules and horses he owned before consenting to lend him the money. When Cataline returned to the bank in the fall to repay the debt, he counted out the exact amount owing and paid it in full. The bank manager noted that Cataline had more money on his person and suggested that he deposit it in the bank. Cataline responded with a query as to how many horses and mules the bank owned, and upon learning it was none, decided to keep his money.|$|E
500|$|The episode sees Kelsey Grammer {{return as}} Sideshow Bob for his fourth appearance. Clips from {{previous}} episodes featuring Bob {{were used to}} remind viewers who he was <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done. Bob's Cape Fear musical cue from the episode [...] "Cape Feare" [...] is also reused. Showrunner David Mirkin found directing Grammer [...] "a joy". Dr. Demento also guest-starred, as did Larry King for the second time, while Henry Corden voices Fred Flintstone. One of the prisoners in Bob's campaign advert is a caricature of producer Richard Sakai. The [...] "Les Wynan" [...] joke was pitched by Mike Reiss. The episode does not feature a chalkboard or couch gag, cutting straight from the clouds to the TV. The 1994 original airing and some syndication edits have included a couch gag.|$|E

500|$|Maes and Taruskin {{write that}} Tchaikovsky {{believed}} that his professionalism in combining skill and high standards in his musical works separated {{him from his}} contemporaries in The Five. Maes adds that, like them, he wanted to produce music that reflected Russian national character but which did so to the highest European standards of quality. Tchaikovsky, according to Maes, came along {{at a time when}} the nation itself was deeply divided as to what that character truly was. Like his country, Maes writes, it took him time to discover how to express his Russianness in a way that was true to himself <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> learned. Because of his professionalism, Maes says, he worked hard at this goal and succeeded. The composer's friend, music critic Hermann Laroche, wrote of The Sleeping Beauty that the score contained [...] "an element deeper and more general than color, in the internal structure of the music, above all in the foundation of the element of melody. This basic element is undoubtedly Russian." ...|$|E

Stratten began an affair with Peter Bogdanovich while he was directing They All Laughed (1981), intended as her first major studio film. Snider hired a private investigator to follow Stratten. They separated and Stratten moved in with Bogdanovich, planning to file for a divorce from Snider. By August 1980, Snider most likely believed {{that he had lost}} Stratten <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> called his [...] "rocket to the moon".|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{difficult}} production of 2046, Wong wanted his next feature to be a simple, invigorating experience. He {{decided to make}} an English-language film in America, later justifying this by explaining: [...] "It’s a new landscape. It’s a new background, so it’s refreshing." [...] After hearing a radio interview with the singer Norah Jones he immediately decided to contact her, and she signed on as the lead. Wong's understanding of America was based only on short visits <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen in films, but he was keen to depict the country accurately. As such, he co-wrote the film (one of the rare times a screenplay was pre-prepared) with author Lawrence Block. Titled My Blueberry Nights, it focused on a young New Yorker who leaves for a road trip when she learns that her boyfriend has been unfaithful. Cast as the figures she meets were Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Rachel Weisz and David Strathairn.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{boarding}} crew were away, Bruun received {{a message from}} the 2nd Naval District by radio, informing him that the forts in the Oslofjord were in action against unidentified warships. Requests on the part of Bruun regarding the nationality of the intruding foreign ships were never answered. When {{the boarding}} crew returned from Roda, they reported that they had been prevented from properly inspecting the ship's cargo. The German captain had opposed the boarding crew in their attempt to access the ship's cargo holds. At 04:15 Bruun received a new report from the 2nd Naval District, informing him that unidentified foreign warships were forcing their way towards the city of Bergen. A follow-up radio message relaying the identity of the intruding warships as German, did not reach Bruun. Relying on the reports he had received, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> heard on the radio news, Bruun reasoned that he could not be certain if the intruders were German or British. While awaiting clarification of the situation, he decided to seize Roda as a prize and move his own and the German ship to [...] further to the south. An eight-man prize crew was despatched to Roda with instructions to replace the German flag with the Norwegian naval ensign, disable the ship's radio transmitter, and order the German captain to move to Riskafjord. After the German captain had refused to follow the instructions of the prize crew, Bruun threatened him with opening fire, but the crew on Roda kept delaying while awaiting the coming German invasion.|$|E
