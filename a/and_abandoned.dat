On their arrival, the released men were so effusive in their praise of Carleton that they were sent home to prevent the desertion of other troops.|$|E

5|$|Fort Cumberland {{was located}} on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which connects modern {{mainland}} Nova Scotia with New Brunswick. The area was strategically important in earlier conflicts between the French colony of Acadia and British-controlled Nova Scotia. Originally built by the French in 1750 as Fort Beauséjour, Fort Cumberland was in deplorable condition. Won from the French in the Battle of Fort Beauséjour in 1755, the fortifications had been minimally garrisoned by the British after the Seven Years' War <b>and</b> <b>abandoned</b> in 1768.|$|E

5|$|In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") {{theory was}} the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more {{difficult}} than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken <b>and</b> <b>abandoned</b> the theory in November 1915.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Reformation brought {{about changes in}} the {{governance}} of the cathedrals as discussed below. Some existent buildings became cathedrals at this time. Several of the buildings were structurally damaged or left incomplete because of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, 1537–40. Many of the large abbey churches, particularly those outside the towns, were robbed, burnt out <b>and</b> <b>abandoned.</b> The late 16th and early 17th centuries saw repairs to the fabric of many cathedrals and some new building and stained glass {{as well as many}} new fittings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} Italian Alps, the Alpine chough nests {{in a greater}} variety of sites than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes <b>and</b> <b>abandoned</b> {{buildings}}, whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere). The Alpine chough lays its eggs about one month later than its relative, although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Nearly 24,000 {{metric tons}} of plastic are dumped into the ocean each year. Turtles ingest {{a wide array of}} this {{floating}} debris, including bags, sheets, pellets, balloons <b>and</b> <b>abandoned</b> fishing line. Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The ingested plastic causes numerous health concerns, including intestinal blockage, reduced nutrient absorption and malnutrition, suffocation, ulcerations, or starvation. Ingested plastics release toxic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, which may accumulate in internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, tissue damage, or deviation from natural behaviors.|$|E
5|$|Parthian art, {{with its}} {{distinct}} use of frontality in portraiture, was lost <b>and</b> <b>abandoned</b> with the profound {{cultural and political}} changes brought by the Sassanid Empire. However, even after the Roman occupation of Dura-Europos in 165 AD, the use of Parthian frontality in portraiture continued to flourish there. This is exemplified by the early 3rd-century AD wall murals of the Dura-Europos synagogue, a temple {{in the same city}} dedicated to Palmyrene gods, and the local Mithraeum.|$|E
