5|$|Gaiman {{described}} {{writing the}} series <b>as</b> <b>odd,</b> {{since he had}} not written comics in half a decade; the story was trimmed down significantly as the size went from six 36-page chapters to eight 22-page segments. He also {{wanted to write a}} comic that was different from The Sandman, his most recognized work. The profits of the series went to help fund his Marvels and Miracles LLC company, which is fighting for the rights to Marvelman.|$|E
5|$|Adults who {{do believe}} that zero is even can {{nevertheless}} be unfamiliar with thinking of it as even, enough so to measurably slow them down in a reaction time experiment. Stanislas Dehaene, {{a pioneer in the}} field of numerical cognition, led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s. A numeral or a number word is flashed to the subject on a monitor, and a computer records the time it takes the subject to push one of two buttons to identify the number <b>as</b> <b>odd</b> or even. The results showed that 0 was slower to process than other even numbers. Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10% of the average reaction time—a small difference but a significant one.|$|E

25|$|On a hot, early August day {{sometime}} in the late 1930s, eight people arrive on a small, isolated island off the Devon coast of England. Each appears to have an invitation tailored {{to his or her}} personal circumstances, such as an offer of employment or an unexpected late summer holiday. They are met by Thomas and Ethel Rogers, the butler and cook/housekeeper, who state that their hosts, Mr Ulick Norman Owen and his wife Mrs Una Nancy Owen, whom they have not yet met in person, have not arrived, but left instructions, which strikes all the guests <b>as</b> <b>odd.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mannock was {{conscious}} his poor educational and lower-class background {{would put him}} at a considerable disadvantage in the well-educated and higher-class surroundings of the RE. Mannock's solution to his problem was to throw himself into his work. The method was practical but his insular behaviour was construed <b>as</b> <b>odd.</b> Mannock despised his peers who were disinterested in the war and seemed concerned only with the uniforms, quality tailoring and how it would improve their chances with women. Tired of the banal conversations and lethargy of his comrades, Mannock looked to leave the RE but realised a second resignation would damage his chances of becoming a commissioned officer.|$|E
25|$|Javier Adelmar Zanetti {{was born}} in Buenos Aires with Italian origins to working-class parents {{and grew up in}} the harbour area in the Dock Sud district, one of the city's most notorious areas. His father Rodolfo was a {{bricklayer}} and his mother Violeta Bonnazola was a cleaner. He began playing football on a field in the city suburbs, maintaining the pitch in his spare time. When he was a teenager, he tried out for local club Independiente's youth academy but was ultimately rejected and told that he lacked the physique to succeed in the game. Instead, he concentrated on school and worked as an assistant to his father with masonry as well <b>as</b> <b>odd</b> jobs such as delivering milk and helping out at a relative's grocery store.|$|E

25|$|This {{notation}} {{does not}} easily provide for ways of describing all chords. Some chords {{can be very}} difficult to notate, and others that exist theoretically are rarely encountered. For example, there are six possible permutations of triads (chords with three notes) involving minor or major thirds and perfect, augmented, or diminished fifths. However, conventionally only four are used (major, minor, augmented and diminished). There is nothing to stop a composer using the other two, but the question of what to call them is interesting. A minor third with an augmented fifth might be denoted, for example, by Am+, which would strike most musicians <b>as</b> <b>odd.</b> In fact, this {{turns out to be the}} same as F/A bass (see slash chords below). A major third with a diminished fifth might be shown as A5.|$|E

500|$|Academics {{analyzed}} {{the usage of}} the term material <b>as</b> <b>odd</b> because, according to them, materialistic is the correct word. However, that would have posed problems of versification for Madonna and songwriter Brown. Guilbert commented that [...] "material girl" [...] designated {{a certain type of}} liberated women, thus deviating from its original coinage which meant a girl who is tangible and accessible. Cook said that the meaning and impact of [...] "material girl" [...] was no more circumscribed by the video, rather by its song. Its influence was seen later among such diverse groups such as female versus male, gay versus straight, and academic versus teenage.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Video Games Around the World, author Mark J.P. Wolf called the game an [...] "impressive achievement" [...] {{considering}} the developers' young age. Internetstiftelsen i Sverige, the organization {{responsible for the}} Swedish top-level domain [...]se, described the game as [...] "legendary", and [...] "an iconic name within the gaming community". Kristiansson called the decision to create an adventure game in Swedish commendable, and thought it could help counteract the IBM PC's stigma as not being a computer for average people in Sweden. Sigrid Nurbo at Jönköpings-Posten noted the game's absence from the 2013 video game exhibit at the Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology <b>as</b> <b>odd</b> considering its popularity and cult status. An eight-week-long video game development camp, named [...] "Stugan" [...] after The Cottages Swedish title, has been held annually in Sweden since 2015.|$|E

Though not {{intentionally}} meant as a pun, Hamer himself has said: [...] "I {{know the meaning of}} the word in English, and that doesn't hurt." [...] Born in Norway, Owe has spent most of his professional career in Denmark, where he is known to a contemporary audience primarily from Lars von Trier's The Kingdom. His career, however, goes all the way back to Carl Theodor Dreyer's classic Gertrude from 1964. Owe has also done much theatre and television work, yet after acting in over thirty films, this was his first leading role.|$|E
500|$|Hoping {{to write}} a song that would {{successfully}} [...] "portray [...] {{in a world that}} is so protected and safe", Ashman and Menken drew inspiration from a story-telling style that is often reserved for traditional operettas. As Beauty and the Beasts opening number, [...] "Belle", a [...] "pivotal moment...in the narrative", plays a significant role in the film by introducing both the film's heroine, Belle, after whom the song is named, and Gaston, the film's villain. While Belle, a book-loving and intelligent nonconformist who has grown frustrated with her predictable village life, longs for an adventure similar to the ones she reads about in her books, Gaston is a narcissistic hunter who seeks her hand in marriage. In roughly five minutes, the song explains both Belle and Gaston's roles in Beauty and the Beast to the audience. The song also voices the opinions of the townsfolk and [...] "sets up the overall theme and foreshadows what makes the town so oppressive to [...] "; [...] while the villagers award Belle high praise for her doubtless Beauty, they see her <b>as</b> <b>odd</b> because of her love of books and ridicule her for her non-conformity. However, they appraise Gaston for his looks and masculinity.|$|E
500|$|Arthur Munby {{observed}} {{that in the}} [...] "barbarous locality" [...] of Wigan, {{the sight of a}} female colliery worker wearing trousers was [...] "not half <b>as</b> <b>odd</b> as a woman wearing a crinoline," [...] exposing his own upper-class attitudes. In Australia, poorer rural women were photographed posing outside their slab huts, wearing their best dresses with crinolines. The French sociologist and economist Frédéric le Play carried out surveys of French working-class families' wardrobes from 1850–75, in which he found that two women had crinolines in their wardrobe, both wives of skilled workers. One, the fashion-conscious wife of a glove-maker, owned two crinolines and eleven dresses, although her usual everyday clothing consisted of wooden shoes and printed aprons. In America, the mid-19th century crinoline has become popularly associated with the image of the Southern Belle, a young woman from the American Deep South's upper socioeconomic, slave-owning classes. However, as in Europe and elsewhere, the crinoline was far from exclusively worn by wealthy white women. Both black and white women in America of all classes and social standings wore hooped skirts, including First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln and her African-American dressmaker, Elizabeth Keckley, who created many of Mrs. Lincoln's own extravagant crinolines.|$|E

500|$|The {{next morning}} Sherlock realises [...] "hound" [...] {{may be an}} acronym rather than a word. The pair run into DI Lestrade (Rupert Graves) who was sent by Mycroft {{to keep an eye}} on Sherlock. They {{interrogate}} the innkeepers about a past order for meat that John has spotted, which struck him <b>as</b> <b>odd</b> for a vegetarian restaurant. The innkeepers kept a dog on the moor to boost the tourist trade, but assure the investigators they had put it down. This explanation satisfies Lestrade but not Sherlock, who insists the dog he saw was monstrous. Calling Mycroft, Sherlock gains access to Baskerville again. Searching the lower levels of the genetics labs, John finds himself trapped and then hears growling which he assumes is the hound. Locking himself in an empty cage, he calls Sherlock, who rescues him. Sherlock deduces a chemical weapon designed to trigger violent hallucinations was responsible. Retreating into his [...] "mind palace", a memory technique, Sherlock realises [...] "Liberty" [...] and [...] "In" [...] stands for Liberty, Indiana. After viewing confidential files, he sees [...] "H.O.U.N.D." [...] was a secret C.I.A. project aimed at creating a hallucinatory anti-personnel chemical weapon, but the project was abandoned several years before. Sherlock realises Frankland, who participated in the project, has continued it in secret.|$|E
500|$|Tesla {{had been}} working at the Machine Works {{for a total of}} six months when he quit. What event precipitated him leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for {{redesigning}} generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved. Tesla had previous run-ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned. In his own biography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design [...] "twenty-four different types of standard machines" [...] "but {{it turned out to be}} a practical joke". Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal quipping [...] "Tesla, you don't understand our American humor." [...] The size of the bonus in either story has been noted <b>as</b> <b>odd</b> since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay and the company did not have that sort of cash (equivalent to $12 million today) on hand. Tesla's diary contains just one comment on what happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering December 7, 1884 to January 4, 1885 saying [...] "Good by to the Edison Machine Works".|$|E
500|$|Much {{like the}} band's {{previous}} work Astraea is considered primarily as mathcore. This is {{displayed in the}} theoretical complexity of their music, such <b>as</b> <b>odd</b> time signatures like 9/13, polyrhythmic drumming and use of dynamics, akin to bands such as Converge, Radiohead and Sigur Rós. Their sound {{is seen as a}} [...] "stylistic schism" [...] between [...] "Dillinger Escape Plan-esque tech-metalcore, grandstanding prog rock and modish synthesised pop" [...] and fusing aesthetics from shoegaze, space rock, ambient, black metal, hardcore punk, jazz, pop, progressive rock and techno. The band is noted for their two vocalists who utilise both screaming and singing vocals, and the album is described as featuring more 'clean vocals' than previous albums. The band's vocal diversity is said to: [...] "immediately creates a rich and textured sonic world". Eva has been seen as pushing her vocals [...] "further than ever before, displaying extremity, contrasted with canorous beauty", with her singing voice being compared to the dream pop stylings of Grimes and Cocteau Twins. When Eva Spence has been asked about the album's musical approach, is much more 'hard-hitting' and 'more direct' than previous albums. She was quoted saying that the album is much more accessible than their previous albums: [...] "You can get your teeth into it much quicker, people who didn't have patience before with our music before will be into this record. It's still technical, but we're using the mathy bits more sparingly." ...|$|E
