5|$|Many {{of the new}} routes {{terminated}} at the Anacostia Station {{rather than}} continue into downtown Washington, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>once</b> had. WMATA officials admitted that fares for most Anacostia residents would rise an average of 50 percent, and that Anacostia residents {{would be forced to}} pay more and travel farther to access the services (such as doctors) and shopping that most District residents can readily access. To help mediate the impact of the total fare increase on Anacostia residents, WMATA reduced basic bus fares for many routes in the area from $1 to 35 cents.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of employment. While jobs such as writer, musician and composer exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>once</b> would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as gaffer or special effects supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.|$|E

5|$|In the Matsya Purana, Ila was disinherited after {{becoming}} a female or kimpurusha. Ila's father passed his inheritance directly to Pururavas, ignoring the three sons Ila-Sudyumma bore as a male. Pururavas ruled from Pratishtanapura (present-day Allahabad), where Ila stayed with him. The Ramayana says that having returned to manhood, Ila ruled Pratishtana while his son Shashabindu ruled over Bahlika. The Devi-Bhagavata Purana tells {{that as a}} man Sudyumma governed the kingdom and as a woman remained indoors. His subjects were disturbed by his sex changes and did not respect him <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>once</b> had. When Pururavas attained adulthood, Sudyumma left his kingdom to Pururavas {{and went to the}} forest for penance. The sage Narada told Sudyumma a nine-syllable mantra, Navakshara, which would please the Supreme Goddess. Pleased with his austerities, the Goddess emerged before Sudyumma, who was in his female form Ilā. Sudyumma praised the Goddess, who merged the king's soul with herself and thus, Ilā gained salvation.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, the European Commission {{successfully}} prosecuted the UK {{government in}} the European Court of Justice, arguing that the UK requirement for dim-dip was illegal under EC directives prohibiting member states from enacting vehicle lighting requirements not contained in pan-European EC directives. As a result, the UK requirement for dim-dip was quashed. Nevertheless, dim-dip systems remain permitted, and while such systems are not presently as common <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>once</b> were, dim-dip functionality was fitted on many new cars well into the 1990s. 1995.|$|E
25|$|Pacu were {{introduced}} in 1994 to the Sepik River, and in 1997 to the Ramu river as a food source, due to overfishing of native species. Local people blame the fish for outcompeting native species, including juvenile crocodiles, {{as well as for}} several attacks on humans. As a primarily vegetarian fish, red-bellied pacu, have also consumed the floating mats of vegetation in the Sepik River, which operated as fish nurseries and crocodile and bird nesting sites. Thus the entire ecosystem has become impoverished and local people cannot subsist as easily <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>once</b> did.|$|E

They were {{a key part of}} the diversion that drew 11 Communist battalions from attacking Long Tieng. After withdrawing from the pursuing Communists, GM 27 was scheduled to again take the offensive in Operation Strength II on 6 March. However, reinforcements being flown in to beef up the attack mutinied. Such reinforcements as did arrive struck south towards toward the Routes 7/71 road junction. By 30 March, GM 27 joined them in their overlook of the highways.|$|E

25|$|With the {{collapse}} of farming in the 19th century and its continued decline {{in the state in}} the 20th century, forests spread back over much of the land. They are not the same forests, however: Chestnut trees, for instance, wiped out by a disease, are not nearly as prevalent <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>once</b> were, and the lack of their nuts affects the populations of various mammals. Stone walls, built largely in the nineteenth century, provide more welcoming homes to certain species; and mammals from Europe, including the house mouse and Norway rat, and from elsewhere (such as the coyote) can create a different competitive environment for some species and a different food source for some (the barn owl, for instance, can now feed on Norway rats).|$|E
25|$|The College {{was founded}} by and {{initially}} associated with the Church of the United Brethren in Christ. Today, Lebanon Valley College is affiliated with the United Methodist Church, which happened {{through a series of}} church mergers: The Church of the United Brethren in Christ merged with the Evangelical Synod of North America in 1946 creating the Evangelical United Brethren Church (EUB), which subsequently merged with the Methodist Church in 1968 to create the United Methodist Church. The ties to the Methodist Church are not as strong <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>once</b> were, which is evidenced by the lack of mandatory chapel services, but the church maintains a presence on the campus. Out of 34 colleges and academies founded by the United Brethren in Christ Church, Lebanon Valley was one of four to survive.|$|E
25|$|The {{next season}} saw them fall back to fourth place, however, {{with none of}} the four matches seeing more than 325 overs of play in four days as the Combined Islands drew all four games - with two ending before the first innings were completed. Irvine Shillingford still managed to hit 257 runs in his three innings, {{averaging}} 85.66 with the bat. 1976-77 saw improvement in the table again, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>once</b> again fought for the title - they were tied with Barbados on points before the very last game, but after conceding four 50+ scores - including 113 from David Murray - and a total of 511, the team surrendered a first-innings deficit of 276 despite 124 from Richards, and though Allen made 101 in the second innings and Philip took three for 15 to boost his seasonal wicket-tally to 20, Barbados made it to the target of 53 with six wickets to spare. Thus the Islands finished second in the table, tied with Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} 2008, 5,320 {{churches were}} {{reported}} to be within the UCC, averaging 210 members. Sixteen churches {{were reported to have}} over 2,000 members, but 64% had fewer than 200 members. The latter statistic probably indicates where most of the denomination's declining membership has occurred, in formerly mid-sized congregations between 200 and 500 members or so. The reduction in a typical church's size has also meant that, increasingly, many congregations are no longer able, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>once</b> were, to afford a full-time, seminary-educated pastor, and that some of them have to rely on alternatives such as one of their members serving the church under a license, the use of recently retired clergy on a short-term basis, or ordained ministers serving the church on a half-time (or less) basis while earning their primary income from chaplaincies or other occupations. While this has been occurring to a lesser degree in other mainline denominations as well, the UCC's congregational polity allows for churches to adopt such approaches without ecclesiological restraint, as might happen in a more hierarchical denominational structure.|$|E
25|$|After Hazumu's {{transformation}} into a girl, Asuta suddenly finds {{his good friend}} Hazumu very attractive, and cannot help himself when he starts thinking about Hazumu in a sexual way. During the time when Hazumu and her friends go to the beach, Asuta continuously tries to remind himself that even though Hazumu's body has changed, the person is still the same, and as her best friend, {{he should not be}} thinking about her in a sexual way. Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often thinking about her in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have fantasies about having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>once</b> had been when Hazumu was a boy. He does find it excellent that his friend is now a very attractive girl, but only wants to continue being Hazumu's friend and nothing more, constantly beating himself up for having impure thoughts about Hazumu. In the last pages of the manga, he announces to the others that he has found a girlfriend, and shows them a photograph of her. They remark that she looks a lot like Hazumu.|$|E
