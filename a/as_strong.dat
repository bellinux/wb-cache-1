5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be {{calculated}} using various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a rocky planet with a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth, according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times <b>as</b> <b>strong</b> as on Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or watery planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an icy and/or watery planet would be at least 1.25 times <b>as</b> <b>strong</b> as on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums {{may also}} react with N,N-disubstituted amides to give {{aldehydes}} and ketones, and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide. They thermally decompose {{to eliminate a}} β-hydrogen, producing alkenes and lithium hydride: another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act <b>as</b> <b>strong</b> bases. In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids (ArCO2H) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'2C(Ar)OH). Finally, they {{may be used to}} synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen exchange.|$|E
