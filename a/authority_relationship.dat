The <b>authority</b> <b>relationship</b> was studied from the viewpoint of educational law as well as administrative law. This enable the teacher to have secured rights, obligations, privileges and liberties. An empirical study has been done to determine the knowledge of the teacher regarding his relationship with his employer. Opinion survey has been conducted with regard to the contract of service as well as the employment-interview by means of a questionnaire. There seems to he a lack of knowledge regarding the <b>authority</b> <b>relationship</b> between {{the teacher and}} his employer. The questionnaire identified that more emphasis must be put to educational law principles with regard to the <b>authority</b> <b>relationship.</b> A written contract of service which is signed both by the teacher and his employer is also a favourable consideration. There are certain aspects of the employment interview which were identified {{to improve the quality of}} decision-making by the governing body of state-aided schools. Finally, a summary was made from the literature study and the empirical study. Certain conclusions and recommendations were then made concerning this study as well as any future research.

When the negotiators can make irrevocable commitments at a low but positive cost, the unique symmetric equilibrium entails disagreement with high probability. In the unique pair of pure strategy equilibria, one party gets all the surplus. Even though we impose no constraints on side-payments, efficient compromises are unattainable.

40|$|Many {{agents are}} fielded within environments {{requiring}} modeling traditional organizational {{structures such as}} military hierarchies and corporations, with their associated <b>authority</b> <b>relationships</b> and a strong form of responsibility associated with the subordinate agents. Furthermore, communications between agents placed in such environments benefit from a strong, consistent semantic model to express not only the source’s goal but more importantly their intent as well. Addressing the need above, we have developed an integrated semantic framework for modeling and operationalizing <b>authority</b> <b>relationships,</b> deontic operators, and inter-agent communications based upon joint intention theory. This allows us to not only regularize the representation and reasoning components of agents but to also realize: improved coordination due to enhanced agent teamwork (persistence and robustness toward successful achievement of goals {{even in the face}} of problems); improved conformance of the behavior of each agent according to its organizational role and authority related to other organizational positions; and improved bounding of the behavior of agents when faced with the imposition of deontic operators from various sources. 1...|$|R
40|$|Trust is {{critical}} to consensus building in shared decision making. This study examined how trust is manifested among principals and staff. This study of middle school teacher-principal relationships adds to the research that Evans (1992) did at the elementary level. The research design was a multi-site, qualitative case study involving three middle schools. The Kupersmith (1983) Trust Scales instrument was used to quantify the level of trust in each of 10 middle schools. The three schools with the highest mean score of teacher-principal trust were selected for the qualitative {{phase of the study}} using focus group interview techniques. Evans identified ten themes of teacher-principal relationships that emerged from the focus group interviews using the Glaser and Strauss (1967) constant comparative method of coding responses. The data in this study found that there was a close match in 8 of 10 themes identified by Evans. Matching occurred in trust and: personal trustworthiness, personal support, collaboration, professional support, communication, shared decision making, organizational change, humor and playfulness. Differences at the middle school level were found in faculty-principal <b>authority</b> <b>relationships</b> and shared values. Authority and shared value relationships at the middle school level were found to be institutionalized within the school organization. Familial values were less personalized at the middle school level than Evans found in her elementary study. <b>Authority</b> <b>relationships</b> were found to be more horizontally related at the middle school than Evans 2 ̆ 7 vertically related description in her elementary study. It is recommended that further research be done to quantify the trusting relationships between teachers and principals, {{from the perspective of a}} secondary teacher/subject specialist. The data should be compared to similar data collected from the perspective of an elementary/child centered generalist within the same school building. This research should target the themes of teacher-principal <b>authority</b> <b>relationships</b> and shared values. Further recommendations include replication of this study at the high school level, and adding a fourth dimension to the Kupersmith study; that of determining teacher-community trust...|$|R

Within this framework, we show that the contractual arrangement which allocates responsibility asymmetrically often emerges as the optimal organizational form, which gives rise to the chain of command pertaining to hierarchical organizations...|$|E

We have identified four different types of authority as seen by nurses: parental, reciprocal, political and arbitrary. Our research suggests that any analysis of <b>authority</b> <b>relationships</b> based purely on structural arrangements would be too simplistic. One possible implication of the findings we present might be that more explicit discussion of the nature of <b>authority</b> in nursing <b>relationships</b> should be encouraged both in training and subsequently...|$|R

We study under which conditions decision makers exercise their own authority and accept their superiors' authority. We distinguish two types of behavior. First, we investigate a non-cooperative equilibrium concept describing explicit exercise of authority. Second, we {{consider the}} possibility of subordinates to submit themselves to authority even though such authority is not enforced explicitly. ...|$|R

This paper questions the notion that contractual safeguards and incentives alone provide the formal governance mechanisms that undergird non-equity alliances. We argue and show that partners craft elaborate committee structures that serve as administrative interfaces for collaborative agreements. These committee structures have well-defined <b>authority</b> <b>relationships</b> and oversight responsibilities and exhibit several key characteristics of hierarchy. We demonstrate that monitoring needs arising from moral hazard and knowledge misappropriation risk, as well as coordination needs arising from increased partner interdependence, are key determinants of such administrative mechanisms in the governance of non-equity alliances. ...|$|R

The viability of authority {{is the result}} of subordinates' free-riding on each other challenges, reducing the frequency of challenges, and making reputations worth defending. The party with authority secures subordinates' compliance through the payment of rents to influence the extent of their failure to act collectively and exacerbate the free-rider problem they face. The model {{provides a}} framework to explain how the magnitude and form of these rents depend on the primitives of the environment and on the authority's design of its reputation.

40|$|Obedience and disobedience {{have always}} been salient issues for both civil society and social psychologists. Since Milgram’s first studies on {{destructive}} obedience {{there has not been}} a bottom-up definition of what obedience and disobedience mean. The current study aimed at investigating the social representations young adults use to define and to co-construct knowledge about obedience and disobedience in Austria. One hundred fifty four (106 females, 68. 8 %) Austrian young adults (Mean age = 22. 9; SD = 3. 5) completed a mixed-method questionnaire comprising open-ended questions and free word associations. Overall obedience and disobedience are respectively defined as conformity and non-conformity to regulations, ranging from implicit social norms to explicit formal laws.

Even if obedience to authority is an important aspect of social life and it {{plays a key role in}} maintaining social order, the concept of obedience has been studied in social psychology mainly in terms of its destructive aspects. Besides, most of the studies have overlooked the role of disobedience in the <b>authority</b> <b>relationship.</b> Disobedience may be conceived of as a protest that undermines the legitimacy of the authority or it can represent an instrument for controlling the legitimacy of the authority's demands, becoming a factor protecting against authoritarianism.

40|$|This study {{critically}} {{examines the}} evolving nature of filial piety {{and the role}} that it plays in the contemporary experience of "living and dying with dignity" among Hong Kong Chinese families facing the end of life. Meaning-oriented {{interviews were conducted with}} a purposive sample of 15 adult-children caregivers, ages 30 to 62, to elicit their narratives and stories in caring for a dying elderly parent. Qualitative content analysis reveals that although traditional filial beliefs provided motivation for family caregiving, the regrets of unfulfilled filial responsibilities create emotional distance between parents and adult children, which acts as a cultural barrier for reconciliation and contentment at life's final margin. These findings underscore the importance of intergenerational dynamics and interactions in the transformation of filial attitudes and behaviors, highlighting the importance of reciprocal relationships (versus <b>authority</b> <b>relationship),</b> mutual support (versus complete obedience), compassionate duty (versus obligatory duty), emotional connection (versus task fulfillment), and appreciation and forgiveness (versus guilt and shame) in the promotion of dignity at the end of life.
