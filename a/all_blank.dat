Besides the above elements, the original wooden material displays aluminum, zinc, iron, manganese, and copper. Magnesium and potassium {{are present in}} the original material at concentrations much higher than in blanks, which demonstrates that these elements are mainly of non-biogenic origin. Besides, the sulfur Kα line is evident in most of the spectra collected from the original material but the sulfur content was not reported by the instrument probably due to the calibration procedure.

6000|$|Nowadays, alas, {{we start}} off self-conscious, with {{sex in the}} head. We find {{a woman who is}} the same. We marry because we are [...] "pals." [...] The sex is a rather nasty fiasco. We keep up a pretense of [...] "pals"--and nice love. Sex spins wilder in the head than ever. There is either a family of {{children}} whom the dissatisfied parents can devote themselves to, thereby perverting the miserable little creatures: or else there is a divorce. And at the great dynamic centers nothing has happened at <b>all.</b> <b>Blank</b> nothing. There has been no vital interchange at all in the whole of this beautiful marriage affair.|$|E
60|$|Neither shall {{the reader}} fancy {{that it was}} <b>all</b> <b>blank,</b> this Reign of Terror: far from it. How many hammermen and squaremen, bakers and brewers, washers and wringers, over this France, must ply their old daily work, let the Government be one of Terror or one of Joy! In this Paris there are Twenty-three Theatres nightly; some count as many as Sixty Places of Dancing. (Mercier. ii. 124.) The Playwright manufactures: pieces of a {{strictly}} Republican character. Ever fresh Novelgarbage, as of old, fodders the Circulating Libraries. (Moniteur of these months, passim.) The 'Cesspool of Agio,' now {{in the time of}} Paper Money, works with a vivacity unexampled, unimagined; exhales from itself 'sudden fortunes,' like Alladin-Palaces: really a kind of miraculous Fata-Morganas, since you can live in them, for a time. Terror is as a sable ground, on which the most variegated of scenes paints itself. In startling transitions, in colours all intensated, the sublime, the ludicrous, the horrible succeed one another; or rather, in crowding tumult, accompany one another.|$|E
60|$|Dorothea walked {{about the}} house with {{delightful}} emotion. Everything seemed hallowed to her: {{this was to be}} the home of her wifehood, and she looked up with eyes full of confidence to Mr. Casaubon when he drew her attention specially to some actual arrangement and asked her if she would like an alteration. All appeals to her taste she met gratefully, but saw nothing to alter. His efforts at exact courtesy and formal tenderness had no defect for her. She filled up <b>all</b> <b>blanks</b> with unmanifested perfections, interpreting him as she interpreted the works of Providence, and accounting for seeming discords by her own deafness to the higher harmonies. And there are many blanks left in the weeks of courtship which a loving faith fills with happy assurance.|$|R

6000|$|The {{windowless}} {{backs of}} houses built in this garden, {{and in particular}} the whole of one side, was skirted by the rear of a long line of premises--being the boarding-houses of the neighbouring college. This rear, however, was <b>all</b> <b>blank</b> stone, with the exception of certain attic loopholes high up, opening from the sleeping-rooms of the women-servants, and also one casement in a lower story said to mark the chamber or study of a master. But, though thus secure, an alley, which ran parallel with the very high wall on that side the garden, was forbidden to be entered by the pupils. It was called indeed [...] "l'allée défendue," [...] and any girl setting foot there would have rendered herself liable to as severe a penalty as the mild rules of Madame Beck's establishment permitted. Teachers might indeed go there with impunity; but as the walk was narrow, and the neglected shrubs were grown very thick and close on each side, weaving overhead a roof of branch and leaf which the sun's rays penetrated but in rare chequers, this alley was seldom entered even during day, and after dusk was carefully shunned.|$|E
60|$|Philips has caught, I say, Milton's trick; {{his real}} secret {{he could never}} divine, for where Milton is best, he is incomparable. But all authors in whom {{imagination}} is a secondary quality, and whose merit lies less in what they say than {{in the way they}} say it, are apt to become mannerists, and to have imitators, because manner can be easily imitated. Milton has more or less colored <b>all</b> <b>blank</b> verse since his time, and, as those who imitate never fail to exaggerate, his influence has in some respects been mischievous. Thomson was well-nigh ruined by him. In him a leaf cannot fall without a Latinism, and there is circumlocution in the crow of a cock. Cowper was only saved by mixing equal proportions of Dryden in his verse, thus hitting upon a kind of cross between prose and poetry. In judging Milton, however, we should not forget that in verse the music makes a part of the meaning, and that no one before or since has been able to give to simple pentameters the majesty and compass of the organ. He was as much composer as poet.|$|E
60|$|He drank his tea and ate his {{toast and}} read a magazine, striving to look as {{comfortable}} and as much at his ease as men at their clubs generally are. He was not a bad actor, and those who saw him and made reports as to his conduct {{on the following day}} declared that he had apparently been quite indifferent to the disagreeable incidents of his position. But his indifference had been mere acting. His careless manner with his wife had been all assumed. Selfish as he was, void as he was of all principle, utterly unmanly and even unconscious of the worth of manliness, still he was alive to the opinions of others. He thought that the world was wrong to condemn him,--that the world did not understand the facts of his case, and that the world generally would have done as he had done in similar circumstances. He did not know that there was such a quality as honesty, nor did he understand what the word meant. But he did know that some men, an unfortunate class, became subject to evil report from others who were more successful, and he was aware that he had become one of those unfortunates. Nor could he see any remedy for his position. It was <b>all</b> <b>blank</b> and black before him. It may be doubted whether he got much instruction or amusement from the pages of the magazine which he turned.|$|E

6000|$|Then he went, and as {{he walked}} down to his office, so intent was he on that which had just passed that he hardly saw the people as he met them, or {{was aware of the}} streets through which his way led him. There had been {{something}} in the later words which Lady Laura had spoken that had made him feel almost unconsciously that the injustice of her reproaches was not so great as he had at first felt it to be, and that she had some cause for her scorn. If her case was such as she had so plainly described it, what was his plight as compared with hers? He had lost his Violet, and was in pain. There must be much of suffering before him. But though Violet were lost, the world was not <b>all</b> <b>blank</b> before his eyes. He had not told himself, even in his dreariest moments, that there was before him [...] "no escape, no hope, no prospect of relief, no place of consolation." [...] And then he began to think whether this must in truth be the case with Lady Laura. What if Mr. Kennedy were to die? What in such case as that would he do? In ten or perhaps in five years time might it not be possible for him to go through the ceremony of falling upon his knees, with stiffened joints indeed, but still with something left of the ardour of his old love, of his oldest love of all? ...|$|E

Nay, all--all the Selinville jewels {{to make you}} a shrine. All--all, so he will only let me love him;' and then, while taking up the beads, and pronouncing the repeated devotions attached to each, her mind darted back to the day when, as young children, she had played unfairly, defrauded Landry Osbert, and denied it; how Berenger, though himself uninjured, had refused to speak to her all that day--how she had hated him then--how she had thought she had hated him throughout their brief intercourse in the previous year; how she had played into her brother's hands; and when she thought to triumph over the man who had scorned her, found her soul <b>all</b> <b>blank</b> desolation, and light gone out from the earth! Reckless and weary, she had let herself be united to M. de Selinville, and in her bridal honours and amusements had tried to crowd out the sense of dreariness and lose herself in excitement. Then came the illness and death of her husband, and almost {{at the same time the}} knowledge of Berenger's existence. She sought excitement again that feverish form of devotion then in vogue at Paris, and which resulted in the League. She had hitherto stunned herself as it were with penances, processions, and sermons, for which the host of religious orders then at Paris had given ample scope; and she was constantly devising new extravagances. Even at this moment she wore sackcloth beneath her brocade, and her rosary was of death's heads. She was living on the outward husk of the Roman Church not penetrating into its living power, and the phase of religion which fostered Henry III. and the League offered her no more.|$|E
