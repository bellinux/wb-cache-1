40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a consumption-based capital asset pricing model (CCAPM) that combines undiversifiable income shocks <b>and</b> external <b>habit</b> formation. Using US state-level data, the paper provides realistic estimates for preference parameters when the external habit {{of the state}} investors {{is based on the}} consumption of the four Census regions. The model also implies four asset pricing factors: the cross-sectional means of consumption growth <b>and</b> <b>habit</b> growth (capturing national systematic risk) and the cross-sectional variances of consumption growth <b>and</b> <b>habit</b> growth (capturing regional systematic risk). This four-factor model has greater power in explaining expected returns than the CCAPM described in Breeden (1979)., Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1992, Rasmussen {{took the}} {{position}} of assistant to S.

When he became ill shortly after beginning the project, Rasmussen took over the project, and with artist John C. Anderton, produced , a two-volume bird guide for the Indian subcontinent which was the first field guide for the area to include sonograms. Volume 1 contains the field guide with over 3400 illustrations in 180 plates, and more than 1450 colour maps. Volume 2 (Attributes and Status) gives specimen measurements, data about identification, status, distribution <b>and</b> <b>habits.</b> Vocalizations are described from recordings, and there are over 1000 sonagrams.|$|E
