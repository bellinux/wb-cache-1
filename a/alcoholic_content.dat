40|$|ABSTRACTWine {{samples were}} {{produced}} from locally available tea infusions (Lipton tea, Top tea and Highland tea) using baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae By 1) and yeast cultures from pineapple (S. cerevisiae Py 6) and cocoa (S. cerevisiae CY 43). Physicochemical analyses and microbial evaluation were undertaken during fermentation. Lipton tea wine produced, using baker’s yeast, pineapple yeast and cocoa yeast had highest <b>alcoholic</b> <b>contents</b> of 7. 88 %, 6. 25 % and 7. 20 %, respectively. Top tea wine produced {{using the same}} set of yeasts had highest <b>alcoholic</b> <b>contents</b> of 9. 78 %, 5. 43 and 8. 15 % respectively, while Highland tea wine produced highest <b>alcoholic</b> <b>contents</b> of 9. 78 %, 7. 07 % and 7. 61 % respectively. Physicochemical analyses for all the wines produced showed that the specific gravity, total solids and pH of the must decreased as fermentation progressed while the titratable acidity remained constant throughout the must fermentation. Colony counts showed a high biomass of yeast cells that decreased as it tended towards the end of fermentation. Sensory analysis of the wines showed that Lipton and Top tea are the most acceptable organoleptically when compared with the commercial wine used as control although the three tested teas were not significantly different statistically. Baker’s yeast was rated as the best yeast for wine fermentation irrespective of the type of tea used. All the wines produced were generally accepted as they were scored above average. This study highlights the potential of using different tea infusions as alternatives to grape and other fruit musts in wine making. It also confirms that commercial yeasts such as baker’s yeast can be used in homemade wine production...|$|R

500|$|Riesling is {{on record}} as being planted in the Alsace region by 1477 when its quality was praised by the Duke of Lorraine. Today over a fifth of Alsace's {{vineyards}} are covered with Riesling vines, mostly in the Haut-Rhin district, with the varietal [...] being very different from neighboring German Riesling. This is partly from difference in the soil with the clay Alsatian soil being more dominately calcareous than the slate composition of Rheingau. The other differences come in wine making styles, with the Alsatian preferring more French-oriented methods that produce wines of higher alcohol content (normally around 12%) and more roundness due to longer time spent in neutral oak barrels or steel tanks. In contrast to German wine laws, Alsatian rieslings can be chaptalized, {{a process in which}} the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>content</b> is increased through the addition of sugar to the must.|$|E

Medieval drinks that have survived to this day include prunellé from wild plums (modern-day slivovitz), mulberry gin and blackberry wine. Many variants of mead {{have been found in}} medieval recipes, with or without <b>alcoholic</b> <b>content.</b> However, the honey-based drink became less common as a table beverage {{towards the end of the}} period and was eventually relegated to medicinal use. Mead has often been presented as the common drink of the Slavs. This is partially true since mead bore great symbolic value at important occasions. When agreeing on treaties and other important affairs of state, mead was often presented as a ceremonial gift. It was also common at weddings and baptismal parties, though in limited quantity due to its high price. In medieval Poland, mead had a status equivalent to that of imported luxuries, such as spices and wines. Kumis, the fermented milk of mares or camels, was known in Europe, but as with mead was mostly something prescribed by physicians.|$|E

A sizable proportion of the alcohol intake is disguised as herbal medicines which are commonly available at motor parks in most urban centres. This study aims to determine the ethanol concentration of the herbal preparations and the vendors' knowledge about their preparation and use. Twenty-eight samples of the paraga mixtures were obtained for analysis from 22 paraga vendors. The vendors were interviewed in the motor parks using a semi-structured questionnaire. Results All the paraga outlets were located in or near motor parks. Commercial motor drivers and motorcyclists accounted for most customers. There were no formal recipes, production involved no calibrations or weighing and thus the components and concentration of different batches varied. The alcohol by volume (ABV) of the samples ranged between 1. 20 % and 20. 84 %. Nine samples were weaker than beers (Alcohol By Volume (ABV) of 1 - 3. 1 %). Ten were equivalent to beer (ABV: 3 - 8 %) and the rest were equivalent to wine (ABV: 8 - 12 %) or stronger (ABV: 18 - 20 %). Conclusions Paraga should be classified as alcoholic beverages, and its sale restricted as such. The production should come under scrutiny, because the haphazard ways they are prepared may pose other health risks apart from those due to their <b>alcoholic</b> <b>contents.</b> </p...|$|R

(mentrasto), Gossypium hirsutum (algodão), Phyllanthus tenellus (quebra pedra), e Polygonum hydropiperoides (erva de bicho) frente à Staphylococcus aureus e Escherichia coli. Para a avaliação da atividade antibacteriana foi utilizado o método de difusão em ágar. Os testes foram realizados com o extrato nas graduações alcoólicas de 0 a 100 % (v/v), na proporção de 20 % (m/v - massa/extrator). Os testes fitoquímicos constataram a presença de açucares redutores, compostos fenólicos, flavonoides, taninos, triterpenos, e esteróides nas quatro espécies. O crescimento das culturas de S. aureus foi inibido por todos os extratos, com exceção do extrato de Mentrasto. A maior atividade de inibição foi observada pelo extrato de quebra pedra. Entretanto, nenhum dos extratos foi capaz de inibir o crescimento das cepas de E. coli. Os resultados são promissores, visto que três das quatro plantas selecionadas demonstraram possuir substâncias antibacterianas, o que motiva estudos subsequentes para o isolamento e identificação dos princípios ativos responsáveis por essa atividade, com potencial de uso na indústria farmacêutica.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on a study of Roman glass vessels found on non-Roman/native sites - chiefly of Roman Iron Age date (AD 0 - 400) - beyond Hadrian’s Wall in {{northern}} Britain. Roman glass vessels have been discovered on 60 sites in total, the majority of which are settlements of various types, and only a minor part are graves. As a consequence of this, the greater part of the material is strongly fragmented, and the number of intact objects scant. In order to shed light on this material, which would otherwise be difficult to understand, Free Germany with its rich and intact grave material is used as an analogy. Compared to the fairly broad range of glass vessels typically found on Roman sites, the material uncovered on native sites beyond Hadrian’s Wall is clearly a selection of goods with an emphasis on types employed for the serving and drinking of wine in their original Roman context. Also with regard {{to the quality of the}} vessels the material manifestly constitutes a selection. There is much to suggest that these objects were obtained through some form of peaceful exchange, and that the underlying motivation for this import was political rather than commercial. By utilising material culture of foreign derivation the elites in the Iron Age societies were able to secure their influence as well as legitimate their power. Thus these vessels were not merely status symbols, but instruments of power in themselves, and we may speak of a kind of prestige goods system. The tripartite model presented in this dissertation is designed to give a notion of how the elites may have employed these imported objects in their struggle for power: a) Material culture functioned as an instrument of power, and by taking full advantage of their greater economic resources, the elites could pursue exchange in order to obtain goods of particular symbolic significance or high value within the indigenous society. b) The cup or its <b>alcoholic</b> <b>contents</b> — mead, wine or beer — was a symbol of power, and embodied the generosity of the king or chieftain, and the bonds of loyalty between him and his warriors. A significant proportion of the imported glass vessels are drinking vessels: cups, beakers and small bowls. c) There is much to suggest that the glass vessels found on some Iron Age sites formed parts of Roman drinking sets, and that a basic knowledge of Roman drinking customs may have existed on these. Hence the elites did not only strive to procure goods of foreign derivation, but also to acquire knowledge of how they were to be employed in a correct manner. The lack of knowledge of proper use would have been humiliating, and thus functioned as a social barrier against those of lower standing...|$|R
