40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} {{molecular}} weight of polysulfone (PSF) on the morphology of bisphenol-A dicyanate (BADCy) /PSF blends were studied. Because the viscosity of the blend increased and the miscibility between BADCy and PSF decreased {{with the increase}} of PSF molecular weight, these two competing effects on the phase-separation were investigated. It was observed that the effect of viscosity was predominant: the viscosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blends <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> point <b>of</b> phase separation increased {{with the increase of}} PSF molecular weight. The phase separation mechanism depends on the viscosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blends <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> point <b>of</b> phase separation and determines the morphology of the blends. Because the increasing viscosity with increasing the molecular weight of PSF suppressed the nucleation and growth even with 10 phr of PSF content, phase separa-tion occurred through spinodal decomposition to form the combined morphology having both PSF particle structure and BADCy particle structure. The combined morphology and the BADCy particle structure were obtained with a smaller amount of high molecular weight PSF content. This indicates that the viscosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blends <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> point <b>of</b> phase separation is the critical parameter that determines the morphol...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{association}} was examined between {{the duration of}} computer use <b>at</b> work and <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> arm-wrist-hand and neck-shoulder symptoms. A prospective cohort study among 1951 office workers was performed with a follow-up period of 2 years. Outcome was assessed every three months by questionnaire. Cases were identified based on the transition within 3 months of no, irregular or "minor" symptoms to regular or prolonged symptoms accompanied with a pain intensity exceeding 6 on a Von Korff scale 20 for worst symptoms or medication use to control symptoms. The results showed that self-reported exposure data were positively associated with <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> both neck-shoulder and arm-wrist-hand symptoms.

In conclusion, {{the findings of this}} prospective cohort study challenges the existence of a causal link between the duration of computer use <b>at</b> work and <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> arm-wrist-hand and neck-shoulder symptoms, based on the absence of an association between the registered duration of computer use <b>at</b> work and <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> arm-wrist-hand and neck-shoulder symptoms.
