5|$|In ancient times, the <b>addax</b> {{occurred}} from Northern Africa through Arabia and the Levant. Pictures in a tomb, {{dating back}} to the 2500 BCE show at least the partial domestication of the <b>addax</b> by the ancient Egyptians. These pictures show <b>addax</b> and some other antelopes tied with ropes to stakes. The number of <b>addax</b> captured by a person were considered an indicator of his high social and economic position in the society. But today excess poaching has resulted in the extinction of this species in Egypt since the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The <b>addax</b> {{are most}} prone to parasites in moist climatic conditions. <b>Addax</b> {{have always been}} {{infected}} with nematodes in the Trichostrongyloidea and Strongyloidea superfamilies. In an exotic ranch in Texas, an <b>addax</b> was found host to the nematodes Haemonchus contortus and Longistrongylus curvispiculum in its abomasum, of which the former was dominant.|$|E
5|$|Decrease in the {{population}} of the <b>addax</b> has begun notably since the mid-1800s. More recently, <b>addax</b> were found from Algeria to Sudan, but due mainly to overhunting, they have become much more restricted and rare.|$|E
50|$|Barwa <b>Addax's</b> title {{contender}} Romain Grosjean {{left the}} series mid-season {{to join the}} Renault {{for the remainder of}} the Formula One season following Nelson Piquet Jr.'s sacking.|$|R
50|$|Terrestrial {{animals are}} less diverse than birds, {{including}} Ruppell's fox, fennec fox, gloved cat, caracal, hyena, camel, gazelles, <b>addaxes,</b> hares, hedgehog variants, fat sand rat, lesser Egyptian jerboa, bats, and others. Barbary lion and hartebeest became extinct, and possibly local cheetah and North African elephant as well.|$|R
50|$|Herck and Ricci {{held on to}} the {{remaining}} podium places, with <b>Addax's</b> Sergio Pérez charging from the midfield through to fourth. Pérez escaped serious damage in the opening lap tangle that caused the early safety car - the Mexican and Josef Kral touching, and sending the Super Nova car bouncing into Meritus' Luca Filippi. Friday winner Oliver Turvey took the second iSport car to fifth, having spent much of the race behind polesitter Max Chilton (Ocean). The Formula 3 graduate lost ground on lap one but then held his own among the frontrunners and resisted ART's Jules Bianchi - who scorched through the field after stalling on the grid - and Arden's Charles Pic to score the final point. Pic's team-mate Javier Villa was another man to stall at the start, while <b>Addax's</b> Giedo van der Garde was making progress through the group behind Chilton until he tangled with Fabio Leimer (Ocean).|$|R
5|$|Due to its slow movements, the <b>addax</b> is an {{easy target}} for predators such as lions, humans, African hunting dogs, cheetahs and leopards. Caracals, hyenas and servals attack calves. The <b>addax</b> are {{normally}} not aggressive, though individuals may charge if they are disturbed.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>addax</b> is <b>Addax</b> nasomaculatus. This antelope was first described by French zoologist and anatomist Henri Blainville in 1816. It {{is placed in the}} monotypic genus <b>Addax</b> and family Bovidae. Henri Blainville observed syntypes in Bullock's Pantherion and the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. English naturalist Richard Lydekker stated their type locality to be probably Senegambia, though he did not have anything to support the claim. Finally, from a discussion in 1898, it became more probable that British hunters or collectors obtained the <b>addax</b> from the part of Sahara in Tunisia.|$|E
50|$|The Sahara {{is largely}} undisturbed. The most {{degradation}} {{is found in}} areas where there is water, such as aquifer oases or along the desert margins where some rain usually falls most years. In these areas, animals such as <b>addaxes,</b> scimitar-horned oryxes, and bustards are over-hunted for their meat. Only one area of conservation is recorded in the Sahara: the Zellaf Nature Reserve in Libya.|$|R
5|$|The {{coloring}} of the <b>addax's</b> coat {{varies with}} the season. In the winter, it is greyish-brown with white hindquarters and legs, and long, brown hair on the head, neck, and shoulders. In the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or sandy blonde. Their head is marked with brown or black patches that form an 'X' over their noses. They have scraggly beards and prominent red nostrils. Long, black hairs stick out between their curved and spiralling horns, ending in a short mane on the neck.|$|R
50|$|Xerocoles {{are usually}} light and sandy in color {{as a means}} to reflect solar {{radiation}} and reduce heat absorption. Some change color with the seasons to reflect more sunlight in the summer: <b>addaxes</b> change from gray-brown to nearly white. Iguanid lizards can change color on a much smaller time scale by varying melanin concentration. They become darker when burrowing and lighter when basking - both the desert iguana and the zebra-tailed lizard become so pale that they appear to shine due to the amount of light they reflect.|$|R
5|$|Today {{there are}} over 600 <b>addax</b> in Europe, Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve (Israel), Sabratha (Libya), Giza Zoo (Egypt), North America, Japan and Australia under captive {{breeding}} programmes. There are 1000 more in private collections and ranches in United States and the Middle East. <b>Addax</b> is legally protected in Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria; hunting of all gazelles is forbidden in Libya and Egypt. Although enormous reserves, such as the Hoggar Mountains and Tasilli in Algeria, the Ténéré in Niger, the Ouadi Rimé-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve in Chad, and the newly established Wadi Howar National Park in Sudan, cover areas where <b>addax</b> previously occurred, some do not keep <b>addax</b> at present because they lack the resources. The <b>addax</b> has been reintroduced in Bou-Hedma National Park (Tunisia) and Souss-Massa National Park (Morocco). Reintroductions in the wild are ongoing in Jebil National Park (Tunisia) and Grand Erg Oriental (Sahara), and another is planned in Morocco.|$|E
5|$|The <b>addax</b> are amply {{suited to}} live in the deep desert under extreme conditions. They can survive without free water almost indefinitely, because they get {{moisture}} from their food and dew that condenses on plants. Scientists believe the <b>addax</b> has a special lining in its stomach that stores water in pouches to use in times of dehydration. They also produce highly concentrated urine to conserve water. Pale colour of the coat reflects radiant heat, and the length and density of the coat helps in thermoregulation. In the day the <b>addax</b> huddle together in shaded areas, and in cool nights rest in sand hollows. These practices help in dissipation of body heat and saving water by cooling the body through evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>addax</b> is a {{critically}} endangered species of antelope, as classified by the IUCN. Although extremely rare in its native habitat due to unregulated hunting, {{it is quite}} common in captivity. The <b>addax</b> was once abundant in North Africa, native to Chad, Mauritania and Niger. It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Western Sahara. It has been reintroduced in Morocco and Tunisia.|$|E
50|$|In August, 2012, Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar of Trinidad and Tobago {{said she}} was {{awaiting}} {{a report on the}} proposed Izombe Gas Processing Project between the National Gas Company, the National Energy Corporation and Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited of Trinidad and Tobago and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC. The Izombe Gas Processing Company is projected to serve as a major inland gas processing hub for most stranded gas within the oil-rich Njaba River basin and other stranded gas in that axis. Specifically, the project offers a total gas utilization strategy for gas that had been flared from ChevronTexaco’s OML 53 and <b>Addax’s</b> OML 124 in the area.|$|R
50|$|Pastor Maldonado {{clinched}} the championship title with two races to spare, despite crashing {{out of the}} sprint race at Monza; the second successive season where the drivers' championship was secured before the final round. Maldonado, driving for Rapax, became the series' most successful driver with six victories during the season, gained in successive feature races {{to take him to}} a total of ten victories. Maldonado won the championship by sixteen points ahead of Barwa <b>Addax's</b> Sergio Pérez, who took five victories during the season, taking a pair of feature race wins and three sprint wins. Jules Bianchi finished as top main series rookie in third for ART Grand Prix, after coming {{at the head of a}} four-driver battle for the position. Dani Clos finished a point behind Bianchi for Racing Engineering, winning a sprint race in Istanbul, with British duo Sam Bird - a race-winner at Monza - and Oliver Turvey taking fifth and sixth places. Seven other drivers took victories, mainly coming in the reverse-grid races; only Charles Pic - tenth overall - took a feature race win in Barcelona. Sprint wins were taken by Fabio Leimer in Barcelona, Jérôme d'Ambrosio in Monaco, Marcus Ericsson in Valencia, Giacomo Ricci in Budapest, Christian Vietoris at Monza and Davide Valsecchi in Abu Dhabi.|$|R
50|$|As {{has been}} the case {{throughout}} the championship, Valsecchi got quicker and quicker as the race progressed. An initial dive-bomb move on Filippi for second saw him skitter over the run-off at the Turn 10 hairpin, but he quickly regrouped and passed his countryman into Turn 1 with six laps to go. He then caught Villa in just one lap and took the lead with a straightforward outbraking move - only to then run wide at Turn 10 later in the lap and hand first place back again. It was only a brief respite for Villa though, as Valsecchi soon repassed him into the first corner and pulled away to secure victory. Villa lost more pace as his tyres faded, allowing Filippi to drive around the outside of him and take second. DPR's Giacomo Ricci came within 0.2 seconds of depriving Villa of third too as they diced on the final lap. Charles Pic took the second Arden car to fifth ahead of Coloni's returnee Alvaro Parente and <b>Addax's</b> Sergio Pérez. Adrian Zaugg got quicker throughout the race on his return with Trident, charging past Turvey and Bianchi in the closing stages to claim eighth and pole for race two. Turvey had lost several places in his pitstop with a wheelgun problem while Bianchi never got up to speed after dropping down the order at the start.|$|R
5|$|The <b>addax</b> live {{in desert}} terrain where they eat grasses and leaves of what shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes are available. Primarily grazers, their staple foods include Aristida, Panicum, and Stipagrostis, {{and they will}} only consume browse, such as leaves of Acacia trees {{in the absence of}} these grasses. Perennials which turn green and sprout at the {{slightest}} bit of humidity or rain. The <b>addax</b> eat only certain parts of the plant and tend to crop the Aristida grasses neatly to the same height. By contrast, when feeding on Panicum grass, the drier outer leaves are left alone while they eat the tender, inner shoots and seeds. These seeds are important part of the <b>addax</b> diet, being their main source of protein.|$|E
5|$|The <b>addax</b> mainly eats {{grasses and}} leaves of any {{available}} shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes. These animals are well-adapted {{to exist in}} their desert habitat, as they can live without water {{for long periods of}} time. <b>Addax</b> form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females. They are led by the oldest female. Due to its slow movements, the antelope is an easy target for its predators: lions, humans, African wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards. Breeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring. The natural habitat of the <b>addax</b> are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts.|$|E
5|$|Some antelopes {{have been}} domesticated {{including}} the scimitar oryx, <b>addax,</b> elands and the extinct bubal hartebeest. In Ancient Egypt oryxes, addaxes and bubal hartebeests are depicted in carved walls.|$|E
50|$|In race 2 Charles Pic {{earned his}} first GP2 Asia/GP2 win by {{breaking}} {{away from the}} early chaos in the Bahrain Sprint race. The Frenchman overtook initial leader Adrian Zaugg and then escaped from his pursuers while they spent the next few laps tripping over each other. For much of the race it looked like Arden would score a one-two, with Pic's team-mate Javier Villa all {{over the back of}} second placed Giacomo Ricci. But the latter picked up his pace later on and charged away to secure DPR's third podium finish in the last two events. Having gained pole position on the partially reversed grid thanks to his eighth place yesterday, Zaugg (Trident) led into the first corners while Coloni's Alvaro Parente and <b>Addax's</b> Sergio Pérez fought for second. The pair ended up banging wheels approaching Turn 4, leaving Pérez with a broken wing and sending Parente spinning into the barriers as his apparently wounded car broke loose on the following downhill sweeps. There was more contact further down the pack, and newly crowned champion Davide Valsecchi (iSport) had to pit for a new wing, while race one podium finisher Luca Filippi (Meritus) spun down the order. Leader Zaugg did not have the pace to pull away and soon had Pic, Ricci, ART's fast-starting Jules Bianchi and Villa queuing up behind him.|$|R
50|$|Pastor Maldonado {{took the}} GP2 Series feature race win at the Hungaroring {{to take his}} fifth feature race victory in succession, {{extending}} his record. Maldonado crossed the line 5.8s clear of Racing Engineering rookie Christian Vietoris, {{but a lot of}} the hard work was done for him at the start when both of the front-row qualifiers failed to get away from the grid. iSport's Davide Valsecchi was the first victim when his car stopped on the dummy grid, prompting a formation lap. The cars had barely finished forming up for the second time when pole-sitter Sam Bird waved his arms in the air, forcing him to join Valsecchi and fellow grid-staller Adrian Zaugg of Trident in starting from the pit exit. That effectively gave iSport's Oliver Turvey and Maldonado a front-row start, and when Turvey made a poor getaway Maldonado had a virtually unchallenged run into the first corner. The race was interrupted yet again when ART's Jules Bianchi went wide on the exit of Turn 2, lost control, and spun back into the pack. He tagged Racing Engineering's Dani Clos, who was able to continue, but was then flicked around and was hit head-on by DAMS' Ho-Pin Tung, who in turn was rear-ended by Arden's Rodolfo González. The accident triggered a lengthy red flag period while Tung was extracted from his car and airlifted to hospital, while Bianchi was taken to the circuit medical centre. Initial reports were that neither driver was seriously hurt, yet Bianchi was later said to have back pains, making him doubtful for the Belgian round. Maldonado was again swiftly in control when the race restarted and had built up a substantial gap when the safety car was brought out following a clash between Coloni's Alberto Valerio and Rapax's Luiz Razia that ended with Valerio stranded at the final corner. Luck was on Maldonado's side though, as he had the lapped car of Vladimir Arabadzhiev between him and Vietoris, and an awful restart from the Bulgarian allowed Maldonado to pull out more than 3.0s on the first lap back under greens. From there, the win was a formality. Vietoris had to work hard for second, the German spending virtually the entire race under pressure from <b>Addax's</b> Sergio Pérez, with Turvey also joining the fight in the final laps. Pérez's team-mate Giedo van der Garde took fifth ahead of DAMS's Jérôme d'Ambrosio, the Belgian back in the car after missing the Hockenheim round, while DPR locked out the front row for the sprint race with Michael Herck and Giacomo Ricci taking seventh and eighth respectively.|$|R
5|$|The <b>addax</b> has 29 {{pairs of}} {{chromosomes}}. All chromosomes are acrocentric {{except for the}} first pair of autosomes, which are submetacentric. The X chromosome is {{the largest of the}} acrocentric chromosomes, and the Y chromosome is medium-sized. The short and long arms of the pair of submetacentric autosomes correspond respectively to the 27th and 1st chromosomes in cattle and goats. In a study, the banding patterns of chromosomes in <b>addax</b> were found to be similar to those in four other species of the subfamily Hippotraginae.|$|E
5|$|The <b>addax</b> inhabits arid regions, semideserts {{and sandy}} and stony deserts. They even occur in {{extremely}} arid areas, {{with less than}} 100mm annual rainfall. They also inhabit deserts with tussock grasses (Stipagrostis species) and succulent thorn scrub Cornulaca. Formerly, the <b>addax</b> was widespread in the Sahelo-Saharan region of Africa, west of the Nile Valley and all countries sharing the Sahara Desert; but today the only known self-sustaining population {{is present in the}} Termit Massif Reserve (Niger). However, there are reports of sightings from the eastern Air Mountains (Niger) and Bodélé (Chad). Rare nomads may be seen in north Niger, southern Algeria and Libya; and the antelope is rumoured to be present along the Mali/Mauritania border, though there are no confirmed sightings. The <b>addax</b> was once abundant in North Africa, native to Chad, Mauritania and Niger. It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and western Sahara. It has been reintroduced in Morocco and Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Addax</b> fossils {{have been}} found in four sites of Egypt - a 7000 BCE fossil from the Great Sand Sea, a 5000–6000 BCE fossil from Djara, a 4000–7000 BCE fossil from Abu Ballas Stufenmland and a 5000 BCE fossil from Gilf Kebir. Apart from these, fossils have also been {{excavated}} from Mittleres Wadi Howar (6300 BCE fossil), and Pleistocene fossils from Grotte Neandertaliens, Jebel Irhoud and Parc d'Hydra.|$|E
5|$|<b>Addax</b> {{are easy}} to hunt due to their slow movements. Roadkill, {{firearms}} for easy hunting and nomadic settlements near waterholes (their dry-season feeding places) have also decreased numbers. Moreover, their meat and leather are highly prized. Other threats include chronic droughts in the deserts, habitat destruction due to more human settlements and agriculture. Less than 500 individuals are thought {{to exist in the}} wild today, most of the animals being found between the Termit area of Niger, the Bodélé region of western Chad, and the Aoukar in Mauritania.|$|E
5|$|Differences {{occur in}} pelage colouration, {{ranging from a}} pale white (as in the Arabian oryx) to black (as in the black wildebeest). However, only the {{intermediate}} shades, such as brown and reddish brown (as in the reedbuck), are commonly observed. In several species, females and juveniles exhibit a light-coloured coat, while those of males darken with age. As in the wildebeest, the coat may be marked with prominent or faint stripes. In some species such as the <b>addax,</b> the coat colour can vary by the season. Scent glands and sebaceous glands are often present.|$|E
5|$|In a study, eight <b>addax</b> antelopes {{on a diet}} {{of grass}} hay (Chloris gayana) were studied to {{determine}} the retention time of food from the digestive tract. It was found that food retention time was long, taken as an adaptation to a diet including {{a high proportion of}} slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time could be interpreted to be due to water-saving mechanisms with low water turnover and a roomy rumen.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} {{supported}} monophyly {{in the family}} Bovidae (a group of organisms comprises an ancestral species and all their descendants). The number of subfamilies in Bovidae is disputed, with suggestions {{of as many as}} ten and as few as two subfamilies. However, molecular, morphological and fossil evidence indicates the existence of eight distinct subfamilies : Aepycerotinae (consisting of just the impala), Alcelaphinae (bontebok, hartebeest, wildebeest and relatives), Antilopinae (several antelopes, gazelles, and relatives), Bovinae (cattle, buffaloes, bison and other antelopes), Caprinae (goats, sheep, ibex, serows and relatives), Cephalophinae (duikers), Hippotraginae (<b>addax,</b> oryx and relatives) and Reduncinae (reedbuck and kob antelopes). In addition, three extinct subfamilies are known: Hypsodontinae (mid-Miocene), Oiocerinae (Turolian) and the subfamily Tethytraginae, which contains Tethytragus (mid-Miocene).|$|E
25|$|Aridlands & Desert Carnivores {{are home}} to <b>addax,</b> dorcas gazelles and curly tailed lizards.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species of}} fox {{live in the}} Sahara including: the fennec fox, pale fox and Rüppell's fox. The <b>addax,</b> a large white antelope, can go nearly {{a year in the}} desert without drinking. The dorcas gazelle is a north African gazelle that can also go for a long time without water. Other notable gazelles include the rhim gazelle and dama gazelle.|$|E
25|$|Mammals of the Western Desert {{have been}} {{depleted}} {{over the years}} and the <b>addax</b> and scimitar oryx are no longer found there, and the Atlas lion has probably gone as well. The remaining mammals include the rhim gazelle, dorcas gazelle, Barbary sheep, Rüppell's fox, lesser Egyptian jerboa and Giza gerbil. Notable birds from this desert include the spotted sandgrouse, greater hoopoe-lark and white-crowned wheatear.|$|E
25|$|At Antelope House {{the species}} present are the <b>addax,</b> babirusa, Banteng, Bactrian camel, gerenuk, Grevy's zebra, Indian muntjac, lesser kudu, {{mountain}} bongo, okapi, reticulated giraffe, Somali wild ass, Speke's gazelle, Sichuan takin, Soemmerring's gazelle, Transcapsian urial, and Visayan warty pig. Non-ungulates {{found in the}} Red Rocks include the marsupials red kangaroo and tammar wallaby, {{as well as several}} birds in mixed-exhibits with the ungulates, such as the ostrich, Stanley crane, and grey crowned crane.|$|E
25|$|Fifteen racers {{completed}} the race while eleven drivers were not classified. The winner was Russian Vitaly Petrov of Barwa <b>Addax,</b> who {{moved up to}} {{second place in the}} championship table with 29 points ahead of Jérôme d'Ambrosio having 18 points. Petrov's teammate Romain Grosjean, who retired from the race, leading the championship with 31 points. The Italians Luca Filippi of Super Nova Racing and Davide Valsecchi of Durango finished second and third.|$|E
25|$|The {{large mammals}} {{present in the}} {{ecoregion}} are the <b>addax</b> (<b>Addax</b> nasomaculatus), Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), and rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros). However, rodents are the most represented order of mammals in the Tibesti, and include the Agag gerbil (Gerbillus agag), Balochistan gerbil (Gerbillus nanus), Cairo spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus), lesser Egyptian jerboa (Jaculus jaculus), Libyan jird (Meriones libycus), Mzab gundi (Massoutiera Mzabi) and the North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris). Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and, more rarely, the caracal (Caracal caracal) and the Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), {{as well as several}} canine species including the Egyptian wolf (Canis anthus lupaster), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii). The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range. There may be as many as 50 endangered painted hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the Tibesti, although some regard these relict populations as extirpated, partially due to the Darfur refugee turmoil and other Sudan generated conflicts. Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the desert long-eared bat (Otonycteris hemprichii), greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum), Hamilton's tomb bat (Taphozous hamiltoni), Mauritian tomb bat (Taphozous mauritianus) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens). The Cape hare (Lepus capensis), desert hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus), olive baboon (Papio anubis), rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) and the Saharan striped polecat (Ictonyx libyca) also populate the area.|$|E
