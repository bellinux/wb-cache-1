5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan <b>and</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administrations,</b> when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution {{at the behest of the}} Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, Gore {{spoke out}} {{on a number of}} issues. In a 1992 speech on the Gulf War, Gore stated that he twice {{attempted}} to get the U.S. government to pull the plug on support to Saddam Hussein, citing Hussein's use of poison gas, support of terrorism, and his burgeoning nuclear program, but was opposed both times by the Reagan <b>and</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administrations.</b> In the wake of the Al-Anfal Campaign, during which Hussein staged deadly mustard and nerve gas attacks on Kurdish Iraqis, Gore cosponsored the Prevention of Genocide Act of 1988, which would have cut all assistance to Iraq. The bill was defeated in part due to intense lobbying of Congress by the Reagan-Bush White House and a veto threat from President Reagan. In 1998, at a conference of APEC hosted by Malaysia, Gore objected to the indictment, arrest and jailing of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad's longtime second-in-command Anwar Ibrahim, a move which received a negative response from leaders there. Ten years later, Gore again protested when Ibrahim was arrested a second time, a decision condemned by Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim.|$|E
25|$|Clarke came to {{widespread}} public attention {{for his role}} as counter-terrorism czar in the Clinton <b>and</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administrations</b> in March 2004, when he appeared on the 60 Minutes television news magazine, released his memoir about his service in government, Against All Enemies, and testified before the 9/11 Commission. In all three instances, Clarke was sharply critical of the Bush administration's attitude toward counter-terrorism before the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and of the {{decision to go to war}} with Iraq.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{promotion}} of free market economics also spurred new calls for democratization in the MENA region. The first democracy aid {{programs in the}} Arab world, including {{the creation of a}} modest $3 million Middle East Democracy Fund, were introduced by the George H.W. Bush administration as a means of encouraging economic liberalization via political liberalization, though the projects were primarily focused on improving management and efficiency in government institutions, as opposed to addressing contentious issues such as human rights abuses, government structures preserving authoritarian power, and laws and practices suppressive of democracy. While the Clinton administration broke with the Reagan <b>and</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administrations</b> in its willingness to work with civil society organizations and promote democratic transition beyond formerly Soviet countries, democracy promotion still remained a relatively low priority and Arab regimes were largely able to resist increased pressure from foreign-funded international NGOs in the 1990s. Nonetheless, the United States spent $250 million on democracy programs in the region from 1991 to 2001, and political reform appeared as a goal in State Department and USAID literature, even if it did not figure prominently in high-level diplomatic discussions.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{official}} police and security sector discussions, the U.S. was undertaking some independent training and equipment donations, though the programs—mainly organized by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)—were not explicitly detailed to the international community. Lia writes that covert contacts and counter-terrorism collaboration between the PLO and the CIA had been ongoing in the 1970s and throughout the Lebanese Civil War in the 1980s but were not favored in the Reagan <b>and</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administrations.</b> After the Oslo accords, the Clinton Administration revived covert ties and intelligence training. In January 1994 media sources reported that PLO officials and bodyguards were traveling to the U.S. to receive training {{as a result of}} an agreement between Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Publicly, the U.S. was ambivalent regarding support for police and security sector activities. The Gaza–Jericho Agreement between the PLO and Israel signed on May 4, 1994 increased U.S. interest in coordinating public international efforts to fund the PLO police who were to deploy into Gaza and Jericho. The day after the treaty was signed, the U.S. announced a $5 million grant for the PLO police and they worked to encourage other nations to donate flexible funds for the same purpose.|$|E

2500|$|While {{similarities}} between the Visitors and the Obama <b>and</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administrations</b> have been discussed in the media, Peters refuted that they were intentional. He has stated that {{the theme of the}} show is [...] "blind devotion", with no political or religious agenda. Peters commented: [...] "Watching any television show is a subjective experience. If you're looking for something in a show, you can find it, whether you're {{on one side of the}} political spectrum or the other. The central theme of this show is blind devotion, and you can look at that in two different ways. It's our job, as storytellers, to put some provocative things out there and leave some things open to interpretation." [...] Bell added: [...] "We're talking about metaphors and allegories here. On a certain level, I just want to remind people it's a show about spaceships." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{struggle}} has garnered {{support from}} Muslim sympathizers {{around the world}} nonetheless, {{and some of them}} have been willing to take up arms. Many commentators think it is likely that Chechen fighters have links with international Islamist separatist groups. The BBC said in an online Q on the conflict: [...] "It has been known for years that Muslim volunteers have traveled to Chechnya to join the fight, reportedly after attending training camps in Afghanistan or Pakistan." [...] Projecting back from the post-9/11 period, some have linked Chechen resistance to Russia to the al-Qaida global jihad movement. However, the number of foreign jihad fighters in Chechnya was at most in the hundreds. Most Western observers regard the alleged al-Qaida links claimed by Russian government with skepticism. Prior to 9–11, the Clinton <b>and</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administrations,</b> as well as other NATO governments, uniformly dismissed Moscow's rhetoric concerning the existence of Chechens in Afghanistan and Afghans in Chechnya as Soviet-style [...] "agitprop" [...] (agitation-propaganda).|$|E
2500|$|The {{use of the}} ADE 651 has {{prompted}} strong criticism and eventually led to {{a ban on the}} device's export from the UK to Iraq and Afghanistan and a criminal investigation of its manufacturer. The Iraqi security forces' reliance on the device was highlighted by The New York Times investigation in November 2009, which reported that United States military and technical experts believed the device was useless. U.S. Army Major-General Richard Rowe told the newspaper that [...] "there's [...] magic wand that can detect explosives. If there was, we would all be using it. I have no confidence that these work." [...] Sandia National Laboratories had carried out testing of several similar devices but found that [...] "none have ever performed better than random chance." [...] Retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Hal Bidlack, a former national security aide in the Clinton <b>and</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administrations,</b> condemned the device as [...] "laughable, except someone down the street from you is counting on this to keep bombs off the streets." [...] An Iraqi guard and driver for The New York Times, both of whom were licensed to carry firearms, were able to drive two AK-47 rifles and ammunition through nine police checkpoints that were using the device without any of them detecting the weapons.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the mantle}} of fiscal {{conservatism}} is most commonly claimed by Republicans and libertarians, it is also claimed in some ways by many centrist or moderate Democrats who often refer to themselves as [...] "New Democrats". Though not supportive of the wide range tax cut policies that were often enacted during the Reagan <b>and</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administrations,</b> the New Democrat coalition's primary economic agenda differed from the traditional tax and spend philosophy held among liberal Democrats and sided with the fiscal conservative belief that certain things needed to be cut in order to balance the federal budget. [...] Former President Bill Clinton, who was a New Democrat {{and part of the}} somewhat fiscally conservative Third Way advocating Democratic Leadership Council, {{is a prime example of}} this as his administration along with the Democratic-majority congress of 1993 passed on a party-line vote the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 which cut government spending, created a 36% individual income tax bracket, raised the top tax bracket, which encompassed the top 1.2% earning taxpayers, from 31% to 39.6%, and created a 35% income tax rate for corporations. The 1993 Budget Act also cut taxes for fifteen million low-income families and 90% of small businesses. Additionally, during the Clinton years, the PAYGO (pay-as-you-go) system originally introduced with the passing of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (which required that all increases in direct spending or revenue decreases be offset by other spending decreases or revenue increases and was very popular with deficit hawks) had gone into effect, and was used regularly until the system's expiration in 2002.|$|E
