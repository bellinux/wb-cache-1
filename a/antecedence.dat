Before the Gulf of California was formed around 12 to 5million years ago by faulting processes along the boundary of the North American and Pacific plates, the Colorado flowed west to an outlet on the Pacific Ocean – possibly Monterey Bay on the Central California coast, forming the Monterey submarine canyon. The uplift of the Sierra Nevada mountains began about 4.5million years ago, diverting the Colorado southwards towards the Gulf. As the Colorado Plateau continued to rise between 5 and 2.5million years ago, the river maintained its ancestral course (as an antecedent stream) and began to cut the Grand Canyon. <b>Antecedence</b> played a major part in shaping other peculiar geographic features in the watershed, including the Dolores River's bisection of Paradox Valley in Colorado and the Green River's cut through the Uinta Mountains in Utah.|$|E

Restriction set on 11. 11. 2016 by SC, Graduate SchoolThe use of e-government {{has increased}} in recent years, and many countries now use it to provide high quality services to their citizens. As user acceptance is crucial {{for the success of}} any IT project, {{a number of studies have}} investigated the user acceptance of e-government via the use of adoption models, such as the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. However, these models do not pay sufficient attention to security. The lack of security is one of the key issues associated with the adoption of e-government. Thus, this study aims at investigating the role of security in the behaviour intention for using e-government services. In addition, this study seeks to determine the factors influencing end users’ perceptions in e-government security. Therefore, in mind of achieving the aim, the research followed a mixed-methods approach, which divided the research into two phases. The first phase is a qualitative study aiming at exploring the factors influencing end users’ perceptions in e-government security. The second phase is a quantitative study aiming at identifying the role of security and its <b>antecedences</b> in the behaviour intention for using e-government services. To achieve this goal, a research model was developed by integrating trust, security and privacy with the UTAUT 2 and tested via Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The findings show that user interface quality, security culture and cyber-security law positively affect security perception. These factors explain 54 % of security perception variance and strongly influence trust in e-government services. The findings also show that trust is ranked as the third most critical factor affecting behaviour intention after performance expectance and habit. The results make a significant contribution to academic research as this research is the first that investigated the factors that influence the security perception in e-government services. This will provide opportunities for further research to investigate further contributing factors and validate the security <b>antecedences</b> explored in this study. This research has practical implications regarding understanding the role of security in e-government adoption and the factors affecting end users’ perceptions of e-government security. This will help the decision makers in government to increase users’ trust in e-government by focusing more on these factors...|$|R

Moreover, in much of this previous work, luck is manipulated {{in a way that}} is very likely to elicit positive affect as well.

Their research showed that priming participants subliminally with luck-related stimuli made them feel luckier and happier. It was also found that the effects of priming luck using subliminal messages increased participants' estimates of the likelihood of favorable events, their participation in lotteries, the amount of money they invested in relatively risky financial options and these effects appeared to be mediated by temporary changes in perceptions of luck rather than by affect).|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we suggest that}} {{knowledge}} flows constitute the <b>antecedences</b> of value creation by means of its communication component. We bridge accounting theory with communication theory and explain how the role of communication is instrumental in capturing the knowledge value and allows for a connection with monetary value. Knowledge is increasingly accepted {{as a source of}} value creation and a differentiator between firms. Building on the perspective of knowledge as a flow, and postulating that value is based on knowledge use – rather than knowledge possession – this paper address the research question: How can we express knowledge {{in such a way that}} it can be monetized and opened up for specific managerial interventions? Extant literature on organizational communication roles emphasizes the role of boundary-spanners in search and combination of experience and tacit knowledge. Individual nodes in the organizations network can possess knowledge. However, to be valuable the knowledge resources need to be deployed and utilized. The use of knowledge will involve the communication of this knowledge through ties to other nodes. The paper proposes that the boundary-spanning roles provide the focal point for such monetization efforts. The contribution of this paper is five propositions for future research on how management accounting and control systems can be brought to bear in their governable and calculable aspects if communication functions are given more attention...|$|R

Suppose that, by a comparison of cases of the effect, we have found an antecedent which appears to be, and perhaps is, invariably connected with it: {{we have not yet}} proved that antecedent to be the cause until we have reversed the process, and produced the effect by means of that antecedent. If we can produce the antecedent artificially, and if, when we do so, the effect follows, the induction is complete; that antecedent is the cause of that consequent.(135) But we have then added the evidence of experiment to that of simple observation. Until we had done so, we had only proved invariable <b>antecedence</b> within the limits of experience, but not unconditional <b>antecedence,</b> or causation. Until it had been shown by the actual production of the antecedent under known circumstances, and the occurrence thereupon of the consequent, that the antecedent was really the condition on which it depended; the uniformity of succession which was proved to exist between them might, for aught we knew, be (like the succession of day and night) not a case of causation at all; both antecedent and consequent might be successive stages of the effect of an ulterior cause. Observation, in short, without experiment (supposing no aid from deduction) can ascertain sequences and co-existences, but can not prove causation.|$|E

The chief principle, then, of savage science is that <b>antecedence</b> and consequence in time are the same as effect and cause.(1) Again, savage science holds that LIKE AFFECTS LIKE, that you can injure a man, for example, by injuring his effigy. On these principles the savage explains the world to himself, and on these principles he tries to subdue to himself the world.

It seeks to analyze the nature of WOM in the motion picture industry and the relationship between the WOM and the box office sale. The <b>antecedences</b> of WOM in the motion picture industry are examined as well. Methodology [...] Online user reviews of 50 movies with regard to the WOM volume and valence from Yahoo!Movies are collected to test the relationship between the WOM and the box office revenue. Other variable, such as stars, genres, and critic opinion, come from various website to examine the <b>antecedences</b> of WOM. Findings [...] This study confirms that WOM plays the dual role of driver and outcome. The volume of WOM, rather than the valence of WOM provides the significant explanatory power for box office sales for the movie in general. However, the valence of WOM does have effect on the box office revenue and the volume of WOM for drama movies. Moreover, the WOM is very dynamic where the WOM volume and the valence change over time. The valence of WOM is mostly positive during the prerelease period due to the high expectation. The antecedents of WOM vary, in the different stages a particular movie situated. During the pre-released period, the genres, critics' opinion mostly determine the WOM volume. However, the critics have little influence on the WOM volume and valence after the movie is released. Surprisingly, the star power is not found to be influential on WOM. The WOM volume and box office revenue in the previous week have a great effect on the WOM volume after the movie is released. Implication [...] WOM is very active during the pre-released period, and the WOM volume has a great effect on the box office revenue. Managers should create the buzz beyond the new movie itself. Moreover, the findings indicates that studio managers should try to create as much WOM communication as possible, observe and response to consumers' WOM actively due to the strong effect of WOM volume on the box office sales, especially during the opening weeks when most box office revenue is created. Furthermore, different strategies should be designed based on different genres. Although the WOM valence is not very important for adventure/action and animation, it has some effect on the drama movies. The findings also contribute to the existing literature on WOM. This approach changes the casual relationship between the WOM and the box office revenue, which demands researchers to pay attention to. Moreover, {{one of the most significant}} contributions this study makes is that it studies different genres separately, and reveal the interesting result from it. Limitations [...] This study uses the online user review to generate the data; however, there is only one type of data source.

International research has pointed at volunteering as one avenue for enhancing employability, and this study presents results that looked at volunteering in the context of employability in a South African sample. Research purpose: This study aimed at investigating motivations to volunteer, perceived graduate competencies, extent of participating in volunteering, along with gender and faculty of registration, as antecedents of perceived graduate employability among student volunteers and to compare the relative contributions of these <b>antecedences</b> in predicting perceived employability. Research approach, design and method: A cross-sectional research design and a quantitative data collection method were used. The relative weights analysis was conducted to answer the research question. Main findings: Overall, the results demonstrated, firstly, that different sets of predictors statistically significantly predict Perceived External Employability and Perceived Internal Employability, respectively. In the case of Perceived External Employability, a biographical predictor (faculty of registration) is the strongest predictor, whereas in the case of Internal Employability, a questionnaire measurement (of Social Motivation) comes out on top. Practical implications/managerial implications: The social motivation factor as a predictor of perceived internal employability suggests that the more students valued the social interactions brought about by their volunteering activities, the better they saw themselves equipped for employment. This gives some weight to the argument that engaging in volunteer activities can help equip students with competencies that make them more prepared for the world of work. Contribution/value-add: The study provided support for the construct validity of the scale for the measurement of perceived employability and evidence that different sets of predictors contribute to perceived internal and external employability. </p...|$|R

Let us confine ourselves to the former case. Resemblance is evidently a feeling; a state of the consciousness of the observer. Whether the feeling of the resemblance of the two colors be a third state of consciousness, which I have after having the two sensations of color, or whether (like the feeling of their succession) it is involved in the sensations themselves, may be a matter of discussion. But in either case, these feelings of resemblance, and of its opposite dissimilarity, are parts of our nature; and parts so far from being capable of analysis, that they are presupposed in every attempt to analyze any of our other feelings. Likeness and unlikeness, therefore, as well as <b>antecedence,</b> sequence, and simultaneousness, must stand apart among relations, as things sui generis.

Scientific inquiry has not yet succeeded in ascertaining the order of <b>antecedence</b> and consequence among these phenomena, so as to be able, at least in our regions of the earth, to predict them with certainty, or even with any high degree of probability.

Nor can it be doubted that if we were acquainted with all the antecedent circumstances, we could, even from those more general laws, predict (saving difficulties of calculation) the state of the weather at any future time. Meteorology, therefore, not only has in itself every natural requisite for being, but actually is, a science; though, from the difficulty of observing the facts on which the phenomena depend (a difficulty inherent in the peculiar nature of those phenomena), the science is extremely imperfect; and were it perfect, might probably be of little avail in practice, since the data requisite for applying its principles to particular instances would rarely be procurable.|$|E

A four-month security awareness campaign was implemented {{as a part of}} the action research and empirical data was collected to measure the effectiveness of the campaign based on a research model of security compliance behavior intent. The analysis of the data indicated that the campaign was effective in improving four research constructs, compliance knowledge of security policies, perceived vulnerability in security, attitudes towards security compliance, and self-efficacy of security policy. The data indicated that one type of campaign event, informal Q 2 ̆ 6 A, was the most effective because it provided the opportunity to directly interacting with the employees to address their questions and concerns. The path analysis of the research model indicated that attitudes towards security compliance is the most significant construct in the model to influence employees’ intent to comply and perceived vulnerability is the most significant impact on the attitude. ^ This research also demonstrated awareness exposure had moderate effects on security compliance and could be used to positively influence attitudes towards security compliance and intent to comply with security policy. These insights help substantiate organizational investment for future security awareness programs and enable corporations to effectively protect company information assets by utilizing employees who are highly knowledgeable in security policies and highly motivated to perform security procedures. ...|$|R

Furthermore, we examined whether there were gender differences in work withdrawal intention, as well as in its pattern of relationship with the Work-Family Interface. Around 420 couples with diverse professional background from two cities of China, Shanghai and Jinan, completed the questionnaire. We also conducted in-depth interviews with five men and eight women from those two cities to understand the dynamics of these considerations. Results showed that women had a higher work withdrawal intention than men. Moreover women might have a stronger work withdrawal intention when they experienced more Family Interference to Work. Men, on the other hand, might have a higher intention to "return home" only when they confronted more Work Interference to Family. Additionally, we found that women scoring high on family load or traditional gender concepts reported higher Family Interference to Work, while men scoring high on work load or low on the personality scale of Family Orientation reported higher Work Interference to Family. Noting the limitations of the present study, we suggest further research on the relationship between work withdrawal intention and work withdrawal behavior for men and women across different age groups and across different cultures. 陳雪飛. 論文(哲學博士) [...] 香港中文大學, 2007. 參考文獻(p. 153 - 176).

60|$|In my happier days, while I had yet {{hope and}} onward-looking thoughts, I planned an {{historical}} drama of King Stephen, {{in the manner}} of Shakespeare. Indeed, it would be desirable that some man of dramatic genius should dramatise all those omitted by Shakespeare, as far down as Henry VII. Perkin Warbeck would make a most interesting drama. A few scenes of Marlow’s Edward II. might be preserved. After Henry VIII., the events are too well and distinctly known, to be, without plump inverisimilitude, crowded together in one night’s exhibition. Whereas, the history of our ancient kings—the events of the reigns, I mean—are like stars in the sky;—whatever the real interspaces may be, and however great, they seem close to each other. The stars—the events—strike us and remain in our eye, little modified by the difference of dates. An historic drama is, therefore, a collection of events borrowed from history, but connected together in respect of cause and time, poetically and by dramatic fiction. It would be a fine national custom to act such a series of dramatic histories in orderly succession, in the yearly Christmas holidays, and could not but tend to counteract that mock cosmopolitism, which under a positive term really implies nothing but a negation of, or indifference to, the particular love of our country. By its nationality must every nation retain its independence;—I mean a nationality quoad the nation. Better thus;—nationality in each individual, quoad his country, is equal to the sense of individuality quoad himself; but himself as sub-sensuous and central. Patriotism is equal to the sense of individuality reflected from every other individual. There may come a higher virtue in both—just cosmopolitism. But this latter is not possible but by <b>antecedence</b> of the former.|$|E
60|$|According to {{the theory}} in question, Mind, or to speak move precisely, Will, is the only cause of phenomena. The type of Causation, {{as well as the}} {{exclusive}} source from which we derive the idea, is our own voluntary agency. Here, and here only (it is said), we have direct evidence of causation. We know that we can move our bodies. Respecting the phenomena of inanimate nature, we have no other direct knowledge than that of <b>antecedence</b> and sequence. But in the case of our voluntary actions, it is affirmed that we are conscious of power before we have experience of results. An act of volition, whether followed by an effect or not, is accompanied by a consciousness of effort, “of force exerted, of power in action, which is necessarily causal, or causative.” This feeling of energy or force, inherent in an act of will, is knowledge a priori; assurance, prior to experience, that we have the power of causing effects. Volition, therefore, it is asserted, is something more than an unconditional antecedent; it is a cause, in a different sense from that in which physical phenomena are said to cause one another: it is an Efficient Cause. From this the transition is easy to the further doctrine, that Volition is the sole Efficient Cause of all phenomena. “It is inconceivable that dead force could continue unsupported for a moment beyond its creation. We can not even conceive of change or phenomena without the energy of a mind.” “The word action” itself, says another writer of the same school, “has no real significance except when applied to the doings of an intelligent agent. Let any one conceive, if he can, of any power, energy, or force inherent in a lump of matter.” Phenomena may have the semblance of being produced by physical causes, but they are in reality produced, say these writers, by the immediate agency of mind. All things which do not proceed from a human (or, I suppose, an animal) will proceed, they say, directly from divine will. The earth is not moved by the combination of a centripetal and a projectile force; this is but a mode of speaking, which serves to facilitate our conceptions. It is moved by the direct volition of an omnipotent Being, in a path coinciding with that which we deduce from the hypothesis of these two forces.|$|E
60|$|A minor event, {{which now}} looks much less {{important}} than it did not many years ago, but which still had real influence in deteriorating moral judgment, was the career of a late sovereign of France. Some apparent advantages followed for a season from a rule which had its origin in a violent and perfidious usurpation, and which was upheld by all the arts of moral corruption, political enervation, and military repression. The advantages lasted long enough to create in this country a steady and powerful opinion that Napoleon the Third's early crime was redeemed by the seeming prosperity which followed. The shocking prematureness of this shallow condonation is now too glaringly visible for any one to deny it. Not often in history has the great truth that 'morality {{is the nature of}} things' received corroboration so prompt and timely. We need not commit ourselves to the optimistic or sentimental hypothesis that wickedness always fares ill in the world, or on the other hand that whoso hearkens diligently to the divine voice, and observes all the commandments to do them, shall be blessed in his basket and his store and all the work of his hand. The claims of morality to our allegiance, so far as its precepts are solidly established, rest on the same positive base as our faith in the truth of physical laws. Moral principles, when they are true, are at bottom only registered generalisations from experience. They record certain uniformities of <b>antecedence</b> and consequence in the region of human conduct Want of faith in the persistency of these uniformities is only a little less fatuous in the moral order than a corresponding want of faith would instantly disclose itself to be in the purely physical order. In both orders alike there is only too much of this kind of fatuousness, this readiness to believe that for once in our favour the stream shall flow up hill, that we may live in miasmatic air unpoisoned, that a government may depress the energy, the self-reliance, the public spirit of its citizens, and yet be able to count on these qualities whenever the government itself may have broken down, and left the country {{to make the best of}} such resources as are left after so severe and prolonged a drain. This is the sense in which morality is the nature of things. The system of the Second Empire was in the same sense an immoral system. Unless all the lessons of human experience were futile, and all the principles of political morality mere articles of pedantry, such a system must inevitably bring disaster, as we might have seen that it was sowing the seeds of disaster. Yet because the catastrophe lingered, opinion in England began to admit the possibility of evil being for this once good, and to treat any reference to the moral and political principles which condemned the imperial system, and all systems like it, beyond hope or appeal, as simply the pretext of a mutinous or Utopian impatience.|$|E
40|$|Volunteering {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} as potentially a very good means to engage older persons and to maximize their contribution to society. There {{is a need to}} understand the entire process of volunteering, the reasons that motivate older persons to participate in volunteer services and activities and to appreciate why committed elderly volunteers continue to involve themselves in volunteering. The present study attempts to explore the possible motivational and sustainable aspects in the process of volunteering guided by a social reinforcement perspective. It further aims to propose an explanatory model for the initiation and sustainability of volunteering involving older persons in Hong Kong. A theoretical framework of the study focuses on the social reinforcement perspective within the cognitive-behavioral approach in explaining the volunteering process in terms of <b>antecedences,</b> pre-conditions, actual experience and consequences of volunteering. A questionnaire was distributed to explore the different aspects of volunteering, including the patterns of volunteer services, volunteer involvement, reasons for and effects of volunteering and personal profile of the volunteers. The target of the study was hospital volunteers aged 60 or above. The research design was a mail questionnaire survey using self-administered procedures. A total of 287 elderly respondents, 63 men and 224 women aged 60 to 86 years, drawn from the database of the Hospital Authority were assessed. The response rate was 30. 3 % with 1, 359 valid responses. The study showed that older volunteers satisfied the pre-conditions for volunteering, such as having good health, free time and financial stable. The present study revealed that a great majority (74 %) of the older volunteer respondents was inspired by altruistic reasons of wanting to help and to feel contented and approximately half were initially motivated by the altruistic motive of social responsibility. Social motives of seeking social exposure, making new friends and sharing of experiences were other important initial reasons. These factors were sustained when respondents reported the reasons for their continued participation in volunteering. The respondents perceived obvious positive changes in physical, psychological, cognitive and social well-being and they were satisfied and gratified with the volunteering experiences. The research also revealed the positive changes in volunteer’s life satisfaction, exposure and experience, self-appraisal and confidence. The positive outcomes of volunteering, such as enhanced self-esteem, life satisfaction and personal exposure help to affirm the initial intention of volunteering, which in turn reinforces the continual participation in volunteer services with the evidence of consistent findings of both initial and continual participation in volunteering...|$|R
