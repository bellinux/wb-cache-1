40|$|The {{debate about}} the <b>amalgamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>government</b> units {{stems from the fact}} that their {{political}} borders (the institutional territory) do no longer coincide with the functional territory required for an efficient provision of most local public services. And both do not correspond with the relational territory which arises out of the private and professional activities of LGUs' residents as they commute daily or periodically for work, shopping and leisure. The core question of this paper is how to reform the institutional and functional territories in such a way that public services are delivered efficiently, according to local preferences and in a way that responds to the needs expressed in the larger relational territory. The paper is divided in six sections. Section one summarizes the debate about LGUs' amalgamation in the Swiss context. Section two tackles the fundamental problem: if too many LGUs are too small, when is small too small and why? Horizontal cooperation is one possible solution, but it creates serious problems in terms of principal-agent, democracy, information asymmetry and moral hazard, explained in Section 3. Section 4 presents the core concept of “noyaux durs” which is one of the effective approaches to LGUs amalgamation. Section 5 details the cantonal financial incentives that are needed to encourage voluntary amalgamation, besides a cantonal planning strategy and technical help in the process of amalgamation. Section 6 concludes with some notes on the performance of the system...|$|E
40|$|The {{debate about}} the <b>amalgamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>government</b> units (thereafter LGUs for {{simplicity}} – in Switzerland: “communes” or “Gemeinden”) usually {{stems from the fact}} that LGUs’ political borders (the institutional territory) do no longer coincide with the economic boundaries required for an efficient provision of most local public services (the functional territory). And both do not correspond with the relational territory which arises out of the private and professional activities of LGUs’ residents as they commute daily or periodically for work, shopping and leisure (Dafflon and Ruegg, 2003 : 890). Additional problems are the openness of economic activities and the emergence of industrial clusters which largely overlap local boundaries. Finally, urban areas and agglomerations usually regroup several neighbouring LGUs whereas the needs for specific public services are identical in each of them and require horizontal cooperation. The core question of this paper is how to reform the institutional and functional territories in such a way that public services are delivered efficiently, according to local preferences and in a way that responds to the needs expressed in the larger relational territory. For the local public sector, the main concern is the reorganisation in a new, coherent public institution of the three circles of deciders, beneficiaries and payers, that is: -the residents in the commune that vote the provision of a public service (admittedly, corporate business and business units have no vote), -the users whose residence or domiciliation can be in but also outside the territory of the LGU which provides the service and -the taxpayers when according to the principle of origin, taxation is attributed to the commune of residence of individuals or legal domiciliation of business companie...|$|E

50|$|On 19 March 1992, the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission, created {{two years}} earlier, {{produced}} its report External Boundaries <b>of</b> <b>Local</b> Authorities, and recommended a number <b>of</b> changes to <b>local</b> <b>government</b> boundaries and the <b>amalgamation</b> <b>of</b> some <b>local</b> <b>governments.</b> Although their recommendations only included boundary adjustments between City of Gold Coast and Albert Shire, the outcome following much public debate {{was a decision}} by the Queensland Government to absorb Albert Shire into Gold Coast City. The <b>Local</b> <b>Government</b> (Albert, Beaudesert and Gold Coast) Regulation 1994 was gazetted on 16 December 1994, resulting in the <b>amalgamation</b> <b>of</b> the Shire of Albert into Gold Coast City at the 1995 <b>local</b> <b>government</b> elections.|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} the poll to prevent the {{amalgamation}} from proceeding, at least 50% of electors from either <b>local</b> <b>government</b> were required to vote, and of those, more than half needed {{to vote against the}} proposal.

Although only 38.02% of the Town of Victoria Park's 20,136 electors voted, of those, a clear majority (61.58%) voted against the proposal. However, with more than 50% poll returns, the City of South Perth response was sufficient to cancel the <b>amalgamation</b> <b>of</b> these <b>local</b> <b>governments,</b> and they remained as separate entities.|$|R

50|$|Administered by the Government of New South Wales {{and subject}} to {{periodic}} restructuring involving voluntary and involuntary <b>amalgamation</b> <b>of</b> areas, <b>local</b> <b>government</b> areas are considered a city when an area has received city status by proclamation of the Governor. Some areas retain designations they held under prior legislation, even though these titles no longer indicate a legal status. These include municipalities (that are predominantly inner-city suburban areas and smaller rural towns) and shires (that are predominantly rural or outer suburban areas). Many councils now choose not to use any area title, and simply refer to themselves as councils, e.g. Northern Beaches Council, Burwood Council. The smallest <b>local</b> <b>government</b> by area in the state is the Municipality of Hunter's Hill; the largest by area is Central Darling Shire Council.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{proliferation}} <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> concurrent with Indo-nesia's 2001 decentralisation. Largely static for decades under the New Order, {{the number of}} municipalities (kota) and districts (kabupaten) has increased by half, from 292 before decentralisation to 434 in 2003. Most of the increase is off-Java. This represents {{a fundamental change in}} Indonesia's subnational administrative, political and fiscal landscape. We present a new dataset that elucidates the characteristics of these new kota and kabupaten, and review political, fiscal and economic incentives for creating new jurisdictions. We find that geographic dispersion, political and ethnic diversity, natural resource wealth and scope for bureaucratic rent seeking all influence the likelihood of regional splits. Since jurisdictional changes will affect local governance and service delivery, we stress the importance of providing an effective institutional framework for the creation - or future <b>amalgamation</b> - <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> as part <b>of</b> a strategic approach to consolidating Indonesia's decentralisation. ...|$|R
