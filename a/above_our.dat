25|$|The {{cultural}} invasion {{is like a}} leafy tree {{which prevents}} us from seeing our own sun, sky and stars. Therefore {{in order to be}} able to see the sky <b>above</b> <b>our</b> heads, our task is to cut this tree off at the roots. US imperialism understands very well the magic of communication through music and persists in filling our young people with all sorts of commercial tripe. With professional expertise they have taken certain measures: first, the commercialization of the so-called 'protest music'; second, the creation of 'idols' of protest music who obey the same rules and suffer from the same constraints as the other idols of the consumer music industry – they last a little while and then disappear. Meanwhile they are useful in neutralizing the innate spirit of rebellion of young people. The term 'protest song' is no longer valid because it is ambiguous and has been misused. I prefer the term 'revolutionary song'.|$|E
25|$|Cemeteries for {{deceased}} {{prisoners were}} gradually opened near the camps. It {{was a point}} of honour for the survivors {{to take care of}} their comrades’ final resting places. Most often, each nationality had its own reserved patch. In certain camps, such as Gardelegen, veritable monuments were erected. Roger Pelletier motivated his comrades: “Doesn’t it fall to us, who have known them, to all of us here who are their great family, to raise, in the cemetery where they rest, a monument of the French soul that, spreading above them like an aegis, will be <b>above</b> <b>our</b> dead, when we have left, as a memory and a goodbye?” Wilhelm Doegen estimates the number of dead in the camps at 118,159 but serious doubts surround this number, notably because Doegen failed to take certain diseases into account. Also according to Doegen, Russia suffered the heaviest losses (perhaps explained by the poorer nutrition of Russians, most of whom did not receive packages from their families) with a little over 70,000 dead, followed by France with 17,069 deaths, Romania with 12,512, and then Italy and the United Kingdom.|$|E

[...] The tank brigade also reported: [...] "our own air cover was fully absent until 13:00." [...] The 5th Guards Tank Army reported: [...] "the enemy's aircraft literally hung <b>above</b> <b>our</b> combat formations throughout the entire battle, while our own aircraft, and particularly the fighter aviation, was totally insufficient." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} and praiseworthy ... is a semicircular roof to the upper saloon, which gives an air of spaciousness, elegance and comfort that is as novel as it is cheering. This arched roof extends nearly {{the entire length of}} the boat, and the prospect through the long corridor is enchantingly beautiful; the arched roof sits so gracefully on its supports, and its ribs are so light, that it seems self-sustained, like the blue arch <b>above</b> <b>our</b> heads. It is painted with exquisite taste a pure white, for any attempt at ornamentation would mar its graceful and beautiful proportions; and gilding and gingerbread work are used with a sparing and chastened hand in all parts of this splendid vessel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ride through}} the dreary tunnel with the dark waters of the canal beneath us, and an {{insecure}} chalk roof <b>above</b> <b>our</b> heads, enlivened as it is by occasional shrieks from the engine's vaporous lungs, and the unceasing rattle of the train, is apt to make one feel somewhat nervous; and the first glimpse of bright daylight that breaks upon us, relieves us from a natural anxiety as to the chances we run of being crushed {{by the fall of}} some twenty tons of chalk from above, or being precipitated into twenty feet of water beneath, with the doors of the carriages locked and no [...] "Nautilus belt" [...] around our waists and not even a child's caul in our pocket. This relief is however temporary, for the light only breaks in through a gap in the tunnel, and some more experienced traveller informs us we are only half out of it. However, our journey is brought to a close without any accident: and we embark on the steamer that is to deposit us at Chatham.|$|E
2500|$|Antimatter {{in large}} {{quantities}} would have a mechanism to produce power on a scale several magnitudes <b>above</b> <b>our</b> current level of technology. In antimatter-matter collisions, the entire rest mass of the particles is converted to radiant energy. Their energy density (energy released per mass) is about four orders of magnitude greater than that from using nuclear fission, and about two orders of magnitude greater than the best possible yield from fusion. The reaction of 1kg of anti-matter with 1kg of matter would produce 1.8×1017J (180 petajoules) of energy. Although antimatter is sometimes proposed {{as a source of}} energy, this does not appear feasible. Artificially producing antimatter—according to current understanding of the laws of physics—involves first converting energy into mass, so no net gain results. Artificially created antimatter is only usable as a medium of energy storage, not as an energy source, unless future technological developments (contrary to the conservation of the baryon number, such as a CP violation in favour of antimatter) allow the conversion of ordinary matter into anti-matter. [...] Theoretically, humans may in the future have the capability to cultivate and harvest a number of naturally occurring sources of antimatter.|$|E

I told him about the celebration held in Pakistan on his seventieth birthday. He kept staring at me. He had risen above praise. As I rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings {{as if he wanted to}} thank everyone who had said kind words about him. Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise <b>above</b> <b>our</b> prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We Pakistanis may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large will always remember him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 {{the economy}} grew 3.3%. HSBC chief {{economist}} for Australia and New Zealand, Paul Bloxham, was so impressed that he predicted New Zealand's growth would outpace most of its peers, and he described New Zealand as the [...] "rock star economy of 2014". Another financial commentator said the New Zealand dollar was the [...] "hottest" [...] currency of 2014. Only three months later, The New Zealand Productivity Commission expressed concern about low living standards and problems affecting the long-term drivers of growth. Paul Conway, Director of Economics & Research at the Productivity Commission, wrote: [...] "New Zealand's broad policy settings should generate GDP per capita 20 per cent above the OECD average, but the actual result is more than 20 per cent below average. We may be punching <b>above</b> <b>our</b> weight, but that’s only because {{we are in the}} wrong weight division!" [...] In August, Paul Bloxham, who coined the term [...] "rock star economy", admitted that [...] "the sharp decline in dairy prices over the last six months has clouded the outlook somewhat". In December however Bloxham stated that he thought the New Zealand economy would continue to grow strongly.|$|E
