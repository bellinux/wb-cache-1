5|$|Shark skeletons <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> {{those of}} bony fish and {{terrestrial}} vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet {{is about half}} the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} objects (cubewanos) <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> {{the scattered}} objects: more than 30% of all cubewanos are on low-inclination, near-circular orbits whose eccentricities peak at 0.25. Classical objects possess eccentricities ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. Though the inclinations of scattered objects {{are similar to}} the more extreme KBOs, very few scattered objects have orbits as close to the ecliptic as much of the KBO population.|$|E

5|$|The Neptunian rings {{contain a}} large {{quantity}} of micrometer-sized dust: the dust fraction by cross-section area is between 20% and 70%. In this respect they {{are similar to}} the rings of Jupiter, in which the dust fraction is 50%–100%, and <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the rings of Saturn and Uranus, which contain little dust (less than 0.1%). The particles in Neptune's rings are made from a dark material; probably a mixture of ice with radiation-processed organics. The rings are reddish in color, and their geometrical (0.05) and Bond (0.01–0.02) albedos {{are similar to those of}} the Uranian rings' particles and the inner Neptunian moons. The rings are generally optically thin (transparent); their normal optical depths do not exceed 0.1. As a whole, the Neptunian rings resemble those of Jupiter; both systems consist of faint, narrow, dusty ringlets and even fainter broad dusty rings.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, many {{specimens}} of a previously unidentified dinosaur were found associated {{together in the}} same bed and locality: a pebbly stratum near a route to Cerro Condor. The specimens were first described by Jose Bonaparte in 1979. For the fossil he erected the genus Patagosaurus, as well as its type species P. fariasi. The generic name of Patagosaurus comes from the location of its find in Patagonia, {{and the fact that it}} is a reptile. The specific name honours Ricardo Farias, on whose land the initial discovery was made. The genus was originally known from an almost complete postcranial skeleton lacking a skull as the holotype, and many referred specimens however in 2003 it was found that a dentary was referable to the species, so more specimens are probably this taxon. Its skeleton was found near those of Piatnitzkysaurus and Volkheimeria in the Callovian to Oxfordian aged Patagonian deposits of the Cañadón Asfalto Formation. Patagosaurus is almost completely known, with many articulated specimens found covering almost all of the skeleton, including parts of the skull. Over twelve specimens have been referred to the species, although some of the material is probably from a unique taxon. Bonaparte (1986) assigned three specimens other than the holotype PVL 4170, PVL 4076, MACN CH 934, and MACN CH 933 to the genus. While the holotype includes a post cranial skeleton, the others are known from cranial material and a nearly complete juvenile skeleton and skull. MACN CH 933 is directly comparable with the type material of Patagosaurus, which confirms its association with the genus. A specimen first referred to Patagosaurus in 2003, MPEF-PV 1670 (which includes just a lower jaw), is also very similar to MACN CH 934, and differences can be associated with age, so therefore, MPEF-PV 1670 presumably represents adult cranial material. However, the teeth of MACN CH 934 <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those of both lower jaws (MACN CH 933 and MPEF-PV 1670), so it can be identified as another sauropod from the same deposit as Patagosaurus. Thus, the taxon only certainly includes PVL 4170, MACN CH 933, and MPEF-PV 1670.|$|E

25|$|Thermoacoustic devices <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Stirling devices, {{although}} the individual path travelled by each working gas molecule does follow a real Stirling cycle. These devices include the thermoacoustic engine and thermoacoustic refrigerator. High-amplitude acoustic standing waves cause compression and expansion analogous to a Stirling power piston, while out-of-phase acoustic travelling waves cause displacement along a temperature gradient, analogous to a Stirling displacer piston. Thus a thermoacoustic device typically {{does not have}} a displacer, as found in a beta or gamma Stirling.|$|E
25|$|Blood {{vessels in}} tumors <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those seen in normal tissues. As a tumor grows, tumor cells furthest {{away from the}} blood vessels become low in oxygen (hypoxic). To {{counteract}} this they then signal for new blood vessels to grow. The newly formed tumor vasculature is poorly formed and does not deliver an adequate blood supply to {{all areas of the}} tumor. This leads to issues with drug delivery because many drugs will be delivered to the tumor by the circulatory system.|$|E

25|$|Scandium has the {{smallest}} atomic and ionic (3+) radii (1.62 and 0.885 Å, respectively) among the rare-earth elements.

There are many boron-rich phases in the boron-rich corner of Sc-B-C phase diagram, as shown in figure 17. A slight variation of the composition can produce ScB19, ScB17C0.25, ScB15C0.8 and ScB15C1.6; their crystal structures are unusual for borides and <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> each other.|$|E

The life support system supplies air, water and food. It must also maintain temperature and pressure within acceptable limits {{and deal with the}} body's waste products. Shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites is also necessary.|$|E
25|$|Bishōjo ("beautiful girl") {{is often}} mistakenly {{considered}} a parallel of bishōnen, {{because of the}} similar construction of the terms.

The bishōjo aesthetic is aimed at a male audience, and is typically centered on young girls, drawn in a cute, pretty style; and bishōnen is aimed at a female audience, centered on teenage boys, and drawn elegantly. Another common mistake is assuming that the female characters in bishōnen manga and anime are bishōjo. In truth, female characters in bishōnen manga <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those in bishōjo; bishōjo females are usually more petite and drawn in a style that is cute rather than beautiful, whereas bishōnen females exhibit the long limbs and elegance of the bishōnen.|$|E

25|$|Iprindole is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a cyclooctaindole (that is, an indole nucleus {{joined with}} a cyclooctyl ring), and possesses three rings fused {{together with a}} side chain attached in its chemical structure. It is a tertiary amine TCA, although its ring system and pharmacological properties <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those of other TCAs.

The chemical name of iprindole is 3-(6,7,8,9,10,11-hexahydro-5H-cyclooctaindol-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H28N2 with a molecular weight of 284.439g/mol. The drug has been used commercially as both the free base and the hydrochloride salt. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 5560-72-5 and of the hydrochloride is 20432-64-8.|$|E
25|$|Some {{disagree}} with these findings, {{arguing that the}} results of these tests are open to human interpretation and susceptible to the Clever Hans effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for primates, because primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged self-recognition behavior less certain. Skeptics argue that behaviors that are said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, and so researchers could be misinterpreting self-awareness for social responses to another individual. The researchers counter-argue that the behaviors shown are evidence of self-awareness, as they <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> normal responses to another individual. Whereas apes can merely touch the mark on themselves with their fingers, cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness; they can only twist and turn themselves to observe the mark.|$|E
