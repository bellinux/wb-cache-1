500|$|The senators' {{motorcade}} {{continued on}} towards Clarkesdale, but Kennedy asked that they {{stop in the}} small town of Mound Bayou. With no advanced notice, Kennedy, his aides, and half a dozen reporters walked into the home of a 39 year-old man named Andrew Jackson, his wife, and their six kids. There was no electricity, running water, or toilet. There were two pictures in the house; one of the Glorybound Singers (a Clarksdale-based Gospel group) and another of John F. Kennedy. Jackson was incredulous that he was meeting the brother of the late president and asked, [...] "Is you really Mr. Bobby Kennedy?" [...] Kennedy smiled and shook his hand, replying, [...] "Yes. And <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> Mr. Andrew Jackson?" ...|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{widespread}} perception that Asian Americans are not [...] "American" [...] but are instead [...] "perpetual foreigners". Asian Americans often report being asked the question, [...] "Where <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> from?" [...] by other Americans, regardless of how long they or their ancestors have lived in United States and {{been a part of}} its society. Many Asian Americans are themselves not immigrants but rather born in the United States. Many East Asian Americans are asked if they are Chinese or Japanese, an assumption based on major groups of past immigrants.|$|E
2500|$|Botham {{went on to}} Bucklers Mead Comprehensive School {{where he}} {{continued}} {{to do well in}} sport and played for the school's cricket and football teams. He became captain of their under-16 cricket team when he was thirteen. His performances for the school drew the attention of Somerset County Cricket Club's youth coach Bill Andrews. Still thirteen, he scored 80 runs on debut for Somerset's under-15s side against Wiltshire, but the team captain Phil Slocombe did not call on him to bowl as he considered him to be a specialist batsman. Two years later, Botham had the opportunity to choose between football and cricket: Bert Head, manager of Crystal Palace offered him apprentice forms with the First Division club. He already had a contract with Somerset and, after discussing the offer with his father, decided to continue to pursue a cricket career, as he believed he was a better cricketer. When informed {{that he wanted to be}} a sportsman, Botham's careers teacher said to him: [...] "Fine, everyone wants to play sport, but what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> going to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pierre, Pierre!--but I {{will take}} your arm again;--and have <b>you</b> <b>really</b> nothing more to say? <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> wandering, Pierre?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> hurled overboard?" [...] asked Nellie, rushing up to Tom {{and almost}} {{embracing}} him. [...] "You poor boy! How glad I <b>am</b> that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not drowned!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Lord Martindale breathed more freely. 'Forgive me {{for putting}} the question, it {{is a strange}} one to ask now: <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> {{attached}} to Percy Fotheringham?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Rick Moranis {{drove me}} out of my mind. There's this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on a movie set. And these comedians walk around, and they can say {{whatever}} they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me. The first thing he says to me is, [...] "Do you just act cool, or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> cool?" [...] That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver's office. And I was like, [...] "Oh... {{this is not going to}} go well." [...] But he was one of Joel's dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn't that sharp. I wasn't ready for that kind of crap.|$|E
60|$|FERRAND. [Suddenly.] Monsieur! <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> English? The English are so civilised.|$|E
60|$|KATHERINE. Stephen! <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> {{going to}} speak? [He nods] I ask you not.|$|E
6000|$|DON JUAN. Consider, Senora: was {{not this}} true {{even when you}} lived on earth? When <b>you</b> <b>were</b> 70, <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> older {{underneath}} your wrinkles and your grey hams than when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> 30? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh God! <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> his father?" [...] said Romola, {{in a low}} voice, too entirely {{possessed by}} {{the images of the}} past to take any note of Baldassarre's question. [...] "Or was it as he said? Did you take him when he was little?" ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{closed the}} door with a shrug, but before anyone could speak, his quick eye fell upon an object which caused him to frown, and demand in an indignant tone, [...] "After all I have said, <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> going to tempt my girl with those abominable things?" ...|$|R
6000|$|BARBARA. Stop. [Undershaft stops writing: {{they all}} turn {{to her in}} surprise]. Mrs Baines: <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> {{going to take this}} money? ...|$|E
6000|$|Don Jer. Throw your snowy {{arms about}} him, Margaret.--[Exeunt ISAAC and DUENNA.] But, Louisa, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> married to this modest gentleman? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cashel," [...] she said, [...] "we are the silliest {{lovers in}} the world, I believe--we {{know nothing about}} it. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> fond of me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Living, thank God! {{and your}} own husband; that <b>is,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> Eustacie. Are <b>you</b> indeed?' he added, {{becoming}} doubtful.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Portico rose also, and, {{flushed with}} the {{agitation}} of unwonted knowledge,--it {{was as if}} she had discovered a skeleton in her favorite cupboard,--faced her young friend for a moment. Then her conflicting sentiments resolved themselves into an abrupt question, uttered,--for Mrs. Portico,--with much solemnity: [...] "Georgina Gressie, <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> in love with him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Lothaire {{that did}} it," [...] {{repeated}} Carloman, [...] "and, indeed, <b>you</b> must not <b>be</b> angry with me, {{for my mother}} was so cross with me for not having stopped Osmond when I met him with the bundle of straw, that {{she gave me a}} blow, that knocked me down. And <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> there, Richard?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{could hardly}} believe my ears. [...] "You, Ruby?" [...] I cried in my astonishment. [...] "You! How do you know? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> sure of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] she said, [...] "about yourself. Be {{as frank}} {{with me as}} I have been with you. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> the legatee of Guest's secret?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I may {{continue}} to pity him? He is such a poor, lonely old fellow. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> sorry he's come into our lives, my dear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{you never}} ought {{to act in}} {{opposition}} to it. That <b>is</b> what <b>you</b> <b>really</b> mean, Captain Aylmer; and upon my word I think that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can get you}} {{a better}} job than fighting--one you can start on to-morrow, too," [...] Kinsley {{announced}} abruptly, [...] "that <b>is</b> if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to help?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then that's your revenge? That <b>is</b> what <b>you</b> <b>really</b> {{intend to}} do?" [...] I said, half laughing, yet with an uneasy {{recollection}} {{of his illness}} and enfeebled mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait? What for? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> on the square, Russ? Or are {{you what}} George calls you--a drunken cowboy, a gambler, sharp with the cards, a gun-fighter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, shut it," [...] {{said the}} man in spectacles. [...] "Pull {{yourself}} together, and chuck away that bit of paper. What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> going to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. JUNO. Oh, yes you might; {{and what}} does that matter, anyhow? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> fond of me? Are we friends--comrades? Would you be sorry if I died? ...|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS. My dear, <b>you</b> must <b>be</b> reasonable. <b>You</b> <b>really</b> cannot stay in Mrs. Tranfield's {{house if}} she objects. She can {{ring the bell}} and have us both put out.|$|R
5000|$|How far should <b>you</b> go to <b>be</b> {{the person}} <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to <b>be?</b> ...|$|R
60|$|My dear fellow, if paint <b>is</b> the {{attraction}} <b>you</b> <b>really</b> need not go much farther than Mayfair.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have had}} no letters. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> going to stay here? Has your {{experience}} of last night not altered the opinion which you expressed to me yesterday?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> going?" [...] {{said the}} man with the shade, looking at me again for the third time, with that queer, unnatural tilting of the face.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{seem to have}} lived," [...] his hostess said to him once, [...] "in so many countries, Mr. Saton. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> only as old as you look?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{put you in}} a play," [...] he said, [...] "which <b>is</b> where <b>you</b> <b>really</b> belong, {{people would}} find you humorous. Your threats don't affect me at all, Mr. Power. Elizabeth can choose." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. HIGGINS. Henry: don't <b>be</b> absurd. If <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to {{know where}} Eliza is, she is upstairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you all got {{softening}} of the brain, {{that you}} don't realise what I <b>am?</b> Did <b>you</b> <b>really</b> think I wanted to catch that train? Twenty Paris trains might go by for me. Damn Paris trains!" ...|$|R
