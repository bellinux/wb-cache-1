Experimental results using numerous benchmark models show that combinatorial test suites generated by our approach using both distance metrics can improve interaction coverage for higher interaction strengths with low computational overhead.

In this paper, we investigate the bit error rate (BER) of multi-hop WRNs employing distributed STBC at the relay nodes. We develop the general model of WRNs using distributed STBC, and we derive the pairwise error probability and an approximation of the BER. We examine the impact of several parameters, such as distributed STBC at the relays, the number of relays, the distances between the nodes, and the channel state information available at the receivers, on the BER performance of the multi-hop WRN. The obtained results provide guidelines about the expected error performance and the design of channel estimation for these networks...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of heterogeneous wireless mesh technologies {{provides an opportunity}} for higher network capacity, wider coverage, and higher quality of service (QoS). Each wireless device utilizes different standards, data formats,protocols, and access technologies. However, the diversity andcomplexity of such technologies create challenges for traditionalcontrol and management systems. This paper proposes aheterogeneous metropolitan area network architecture thatcombines an IEEE 802. 11 wireless mesh network with a long-term evolution (LTE) network. In addition, a new heterogeneous routing protocol and a routing algorithm based on reinforcement learning called Cognitive Heterogeneous Routing (CHR) are proposed to select the appropriate transmission technology based on parameters from each network. The proposed heterogeneous network overcomes the problems of sending packets over long paths, island nodes and interference in wireless mesh network and increases the overall capacity of the combined network by utilizing unlicensed frequency bands instead of buying more license frequency bands for LTE. The work is validated through extensive simulations that indicate that the proposed heterogeneous wireless mesh network outperforms the LTE and Wi-Fi networks when used individually. The simulation results show that the proposed network <b>achieves</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> up to 200 % increase in throughput compared with Wi-Fi-only networks or LTE-only networks...|$|E
