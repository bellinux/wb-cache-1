5|$|Concerned about a {{divide in}} the party costing the party McConnell's seat in the general election, the Republican Party of Kentucky asked both {{candidates}} to sign <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> <b>to</b> support the party's eventual nominee in the general election. McConnell signed the pledge, but Bevin did not. All Republican members of Kentucky's congressional caucus joined McConnell in signing the pledge except 4th District congressman Thomas Massie, a legislator aligned with the Tea Party.|$|E
5|$|Congress further {{weakened}} the acts in 1894 by removing a provision against conspiracy. In 1877, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes {{was elected president}} after a highly contested election, receiving support from three Southern states in exchange for <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> <b>to</b> allow white Democratic governments to rule without federal interference. As president, he refused to enforce federal civil rights protections, allowing states to begin to implement racially discriminatory Jim Crow laws. A Federal Elections Bill was successfully filibustered in the Senate.|$|E

This took place in March 631 AD, 9AH,11th month of the Islamic Calendar. In this campaign, Khaled took the Prince hostage and threatened to kill him until the door of the castle was opened.

5|$|In 1164-65 Manuel's cousin Andronikos, {{the future}} emperor, escaped from captivity in Byzantium and {{fled to the}} court of Yaroslav in Galicia. This situation, holding out the {{alarming}} prospect of Andronikos making a bid for Manuel's throne sponsored by both Galicia and Hungary, spurred the Byzantines into an unprecedented flurry of diplomacy. Manuel pardoned Andronikos and persuaded him to return to Constantinople in 1165. A mission to Kiev, then ruled by Prince Rostislav, resulted in a favourable treaty and <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> <b>to</b> supply the Empire with auxiliary troops; Yaroslav of Galicia was also persuaded to renounce his Hungarian connections and return fully into the imperial fold. As late as 1200 the princes of Galicia were providing invaluable services against the enemies of the Empire, at that time the Cumans.|$|E
5|$|Lord Grey's first {{announcement}} as Prime Minister was <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> <b>to</b> {{carry out}} parliamentary reform. On 1 March 1831, Lord John Russell brought forward the Reform Bill in the House of Commons on the government's behalf. The bill disfranchised 60 {{of the smallest}} boroughs, and reduced the representation of 47 others. Some seats were completely abolished, while others were redistributed to the London suburbs, to large cities, to the counties, and to Scotland and Ireland. Furthermore, the bill standardised and expanded the borough franchise, increasing {{the size of the}} electorate (according to one estimate) by half a million voters.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} duel with Chambers, Rowan moved to Frankfort, Kentucky, the state capital. In 1802, {{he was one}} of 32 men who signed <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> <b>to</b> bring James Madison to Transylvania University as superintendent. This action began a long {{relationship}} between Rowan and Transylvania, and the university presented him with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1823. Governor Christopher Greenup appointed Rowan Secretary of State in 1804. He served until 1806, when {{he was elected to the}} U.S. House of Representatives. He represented Kentucky's Third District (which included Bardstown) during the Tenth Congress from March 4, 1807 to March 3, 1809, even though he did not reside in that district at the time.|$|E
5|$|By the {{following}} day, 29 November, the garrison's water supply had been exhausted. The {{walls of the}} fort had also collapsed and the garrison was exposed, leading to further casualties amongst the Nepali troops. Seeing the disheartened state of men, the Captain and other officers asked them to sign <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> <b>to</b> fight to the last. Eighty-four soldiers signed. However, that night the Mleccha Kalanala Company, which had arrived as reinforcements and was stationed at a portico east of Nalapani, secretly abandoned their post, taking with them their arms and colours. Seeing this, {{some of the men}} who had signed the pledge followed. The 50 or 60 men that remained, overcome by the hopelessness of the situation, felt that instead of confronting certain death by remaining in the fort, it was better to escape to the hills and hold their position there. Perhaps unable to convince their commanders with words, the escaping men caught hold of their Captain and other officers by their arms, and dragged them away from the fort. Learning of this new movement, the British renewed their fire; but the Nepalese managed to cut through and make a successful escape.|$|E
5|$|In Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism, Zwingli {{outlined}} his {{disagreements with}} both the Catholic and the Anabaptist positions. He accused the Anabaptists of adding to the word of God and noted {{that there is no}} law forbidding infant baptism. He challenged Catholics by denying that the water of baptism can have the power to wash away sin. Zwingli understood baptism to be a pledge or a promise, but he disputed the Anabaptist position that it is <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> <b>to</b> live without sin, noting that such a pledge brings back the hypocrisy of legalism. He argued against their view that those that received the Spirit and were able to live without sin were the only persons qualified to partake in baptism. At the same time he asserted that rebaptism had no support in scripture. The Anabaptists raised the objection that Christ did not baptise children, and so Christians, likewise, should not baptise their children. Zwingli responded by noting that kind of argument would imply women should not participate in communion because there were no women at the last supper. Although there was no commandment to baptise children specifically, the need for baptism was clearly stated in scripture. In a separate discussion on original sin, Zwingli denies original guilt. He refers to I Corinthians 7:12–14 which states that the children of one Christian parent are holy and thus they are counted among the sons of God. Infants should be baptised because there is only one church and one baptism, not a partial church and partial baptism.|$|E

5|$|There Geoffrey of Villehardouin {{had entered}} {{the service of a}} local Greek magnate against his rivals, and had gained the {{impression}} that the country was easy to take. When the magnate died, his son broke off the alliance with him, but Villehardouin, learning that the Crusaders under Boniface were besieging the Greek magnate Leo Sgouros in Nauplia and the Acrocorinth in the northwest, set out to seek his aid. Boniface sought to retain him in his own service, but Villehardouin teamed up with his fellow Champenois, Champlitte, whom he enticed with tales of the richness of the land and with <b>a</b> <b>pledge</b> <b>to</b> recognize him as his lord. Boniface finally sanctioned their undertaking, and in charge of around a hundred knights and several soldiers, Champlitte and Villehardouin set out together to conquer the Morea. The towns of Patras and Andravida fell without struggle, and at the latter Champlitte received the homage of the local magnates and people of the Skorta and Mesarea. From there the Franks moved south along the coast, accompanied by a fleet, easily taking the fortress of Pontikon, which they repaired and garrisoned. They bypassed the strong fortress of Arkadia (Kyparissia), and passing through Navarino, arrived at Modon. They repaired the fortress walls, long ago torn down by the Venetians to stop its use as a pirate base, and assaulted the nearby fort of Coron, which fell after a single day, and the town of Kalamata, which surrendered.|$|E
