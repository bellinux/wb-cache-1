50|$|Lovemap theory {{suggests}} that voyeurism exists because looking at naked others shifts from <b>an</b> ancillary <b>sexual</b> behavior, to <b>a</b> primary <b>sexual</b> act.

5|$|With {{regard to}} sexual {{orientation}} categories, asexuality may be argued {{as not being}} a meaningful category {{to add to the}} continuum, and instead argued as the lack of <b>a</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation or sexuality. Other arguments propose that asexuality is the denial of one's natural sexuality, and that it is a disorder caused by shame of sexuality, anxiety or sexual abuse, sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity simply to please a romantic partner. Within the context of sexual orientation identity politics, asexuality may pragmatically fulfill the political function of <b>a</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation identity category.|$|E

2500|$|While {{gender is}} not a {{reliable}} predictor of how any individual will react to sexual and emotional infidelity, there are nonetheless differences in how {{men and women on}} average react to sexual and emotional infidelity. [...] Culturally Western men, relative to culturally Western women, find it more difficult to forgive <b>a</b> partner's <b>sexual</b> infidelity than <b>a</b> partner's emotional infidelity. [...] Western men {{are also more likely to}} break up in response to <b>a</b> partner's <b>sexual</b> infidelity than in response to a partner's emotional infidelity. [...] Conversely, Western women on average find it more difficult to forgive a partner's emotional infidelity than <b>a</b> partner's <b>sexual</b> infidelity, and are more likely to end a relationship in response to a partner's emotional infidelity. [...] A possible explanation for these differences has been proposed by evolutionary psychologists: over human evolution, <b>a</b> partner's <b>sexual</b> infidelity placed men, but not women, at risk of investing resources in a rival's offspring. [...] Therefore, <b>a</b> partner's <b>sexual</b> infidelity represents <b>a</b> potentially more costly adaptive problem for men than women. [...] As such, modern men have psychological mechanisms that are acutely sensitive to <b>a</b> partner's <b>sexual</b> infidelity.|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>sexual</b> {{harassment}} {{lawsuit was}} filed against Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{in the previous}} episode, and she must take <b>a</b> <b>sexual</b> harassment training as a result. In addition, she cannot return to work until she is done with her training. Liz, however, cannot handle life without work, as she needs the stress. Her attitude changes when she meets one of her neighbors, Emily (Elizabeth Marvel). She understands how Liz feels because she was just like Liz and tells her there are better ways to live. Liz hangs out with Emily and her friends (Mary Catherine Garrison, Kerry Butler, and Christina Gausas), who spend majority of their time getting spa treatments and going shopping. Liz gets {{so caught up in}} their lifestyle that she forgets to watch her show, The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). Not wanting to come back to work—as she is intrigued by her new friends' lifestyle—Liz sexually harasses her counselor, Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane). She goes back to hanging out with Emily and her friends, but soon discovers that they are a Girl Fight Club, which disappoints Liz. In order for her to get out, Liz needs to fight them.|$|E
5|$|Anamorphic or {{imperfect}} fungi {{are those that}} seem to lack <b>a</b> <b>sexual</b> stage in their life cycle, and typically reproduce {{by the process of}} mitosis in structures called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage—or teleomorph stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The anamorphic state of S.coccinea is Molliardiomyces dudleyi.|$|E
