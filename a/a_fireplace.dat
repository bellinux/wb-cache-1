5|$|South of {{the great}} hall was a two-storey {{building}} containing withdrawing chambers, dating from around 1200. Narrow windows opening onto the bailey were original but have since been filled in. The first floor was entirely occupied by the great chamber, furnished with <b>a</b> <b>fireplace.</b> In the south-west {{corner of the room}} was a door to a small room which was perhaps used as a safe. The ground floor was used as a cellar, through which the Carrickfergus Tower could be accessed. The polygonal tower was also accessible through the great chamber at first floor level. Fitted with latrines and <b>a</b> <b>fireplace,</b> it was an extension of the lordly accommodation provided by the great chamber.|$|E
5|$|The room on {{the south}} side (separated by the other rooms due to the hall's height) was {{accessed}} via the main staircase. This room also had <b>a</b> <b>fireplace</b> and a garderobe, and was probably used by guests.|$|E
5|$|In the Truman Study is <b>a</b> <b>fireplace</b> mantel {{that was}} {{originally}} {{installed in the}} White House. It was removed to Blair House during Truman's occupancy, when he used this room as his personal office. In 1987, the mantel was refinished in white enamel with gold-leaf accents. In 2004, before the state funeral of Ronald Reagan, Nancy Reagan used the Truman Study to receive visitors.|$|E
50|$|An outdoor <b>fireplace</b> is <b>a</b> {{place for}} {{building}} fires {{outside of the}} home. Similar in construction to <b>an</b> indoor <b>fireplace,</b> <b>an</b> outdoor <b>fireplace</b> is usually added to a stone, brick, or concrete patio. It often consists of a firebox and a chimney. <b>As</b> with indoor <b>fireplaces,</b> <b>an</b> outdoor <b>fireplace</b> requires cleaning and maintenance to keep it looking and working at its best. While <b>an</b> outdoor <b>fireplace</b> may {{not need to be}} cleaned as often, it will need to be cleaned regularly in order to keep it reasonably tidy and maintained and to remove ash build.|$|R
50|$|The Library has a {{panelled}} {{ceiling with}} diamond motifs. It contains imitation Jacobean panelling and <b>a</b> Jacobean <b>fireplace</b> from the now-demolished Marton Hall. The Study {{also has a}} panelled ceiling, {{and in this case}} includes a circular central motif. The Private Dining Room contains <b>a</b> 19th-century marble <b>fireplace,</b> and the Ground Floor Bedroom has a coffered ceiling and <b>a</b> Victorian-baroque <b>fireplace.</b>|$|R
50|$|The interior, {{which has}} been altered considerably, {{includes}} a vaulted kitchen, equipped with <b>a</b> wide-arched <b>fireplace,</b> and another room with <b>a</b> canopied <b>fireplace.</b> The remains of the castle are protected as a category B listed building and as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|R
5|$|The {{first was}} floor was {{accessed}} via the main staircase, {{situated in the}} east tower. The first room encountered was the great hall, which rose three floors. To the viewer's immediate left was a kitchen (with clerestory lighting), and further on to the left was a butlery and pantry with a garderobe. To the viewer's back right was a small passage containing a private staircase and {{the entrance to the}} oratory (its roof vaulted with an east window) in the east tower. The oratory was entered via a five-and-a-half high pointed-arch doorway and contained an altar and piscina, of which only an ornamental niche remains. There was <b>a</b> <b>fireplace</b> on the north wall of the great hall and behind the north wall was the great chamber containing <b>a</b> <b>fireplace,</b> garderobe and a window seat on the east wall. To the west of the hall {{was the head of the}} west window. The portcullis is believed to have been raised into the hall in front of this window.|$|E
5|$|The hall has a hammerbeam roof; {{the louvre}} in the centre is now glazed, but was {{originally}} {{the only means}} of escape for smoke rising from <b>a</b> <b>fireplace</b> in the centre of the floor. The wooden panelling was designed by Ninian Comper and was erected in 1911 in place of some previous 19th-century Gothic type, though even earlier panelling, dating from 1710, is evident in the Buttery.|$|E
5|$|After being {{purchased}} by the Guellers in 2004, the restaurant was redecorated and modernised, the d√©cor having become shabby under previous owners. The new decorations included recessed lighting and fabric-covered walls. There is <b>a</b> <b>fireplace</b> in {{the centre of the}} dining room, with an 18th-century settle (a type of bench) beside it. Elements from the Reid and Long era remain, with the bar and ceilings still being recognisable from their time at the restaurant.|$|E
25|$|In 1743, Benjamin Franklin invented <b>an</b> {{all-metal}} <b>fireplace</b> with <b>an</b> {{attempt to}} improve the efficiency. It was still <b>an</b> open faced <b>fireplace,</b> but improved on efficiency compared to old-fashioned fireplaces.|$|R

5|$|Brown {{was born}} on 13 October 1926 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He was one of six {{children}} born to Julia Lindsey Brown, a schoolteacher, and John Brown, a grocery warehouse worker. He had four brothers, Marvin, William, Fletcher, and Lura, {{as well as an}} older sister known as Johnny. Brown's ancestry was African American, Chicksaw, and Choctaw. The family lived in a house without central heating or indoor plumbing so they relied on <b>a</b> <b>fireplace</b> for warmth. As a child, Jesse's brother William fell into this fireplace and was severely burned.|$|E
5|$|The DVD's special {{features}} include {{an interview with}} Wiseau, who is asked questions by an off-screen Greg Sestero. Wiseau sits {{directly in front of}} <b>a</b> <b>fireplace,</b> with a mantel cluttered by various props from the film; next to him sits a large framed theatrical poster for the film. A few of Wiseau's answers are dubbed in, although it is evident that the dubbed responses match what he was originally saying. Wiseau fails to answer several of the questions, instead offering non sequiturs.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opens with}} Rover, a collie {{playing with a}} child in front of <b>a</b> <b>fireplace.</b> Later that day, the baby is taken out in a pram by her nurse. The nurse refuses to aid a beggar woman, and is then distracted upon meeting a soldier. While talking to the soldier, she pays no {{attention}} to the baby, and the beggar woman approaches from behind and snatches the sleeping child.|$|E

5|$|The {{rooms on}} {{the north and east}} sides of the third floor were {{accessed}} via the private staircase. The rooms were two family rooms, one above the oratory and a larger one above the great chamber. The larger one had <b>a</b> <b>fireplace</b> and a garderobe, and was likely the baron's bedroom; the smaller room was either the chaplain's quarters or a family room. Both were connected via a lobby {{at the top of the}} private staircase.|$|E
5|$|About 1558, {{according}} to a date on <b>a</b> <b>fireplace,</b> Bess of Hardwick and her third husband, Sir John's son Sir William St Loe, added a north east wing with a parlour and chapel, which includes Tudor buttresses. Sir William St Loe was a soldier, politician and courtier. His official positions included Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, Chief Butler of England and Member of Parliament for Derbyshire. He died suddenly without male issue in 1564/5, which Mary S. Lovell suggests may have been {{as a result of}} poisoning by his younger brother. All his property was left Bess, to the detriment of his daughters and brother. When Bess died in 1608 the house was left to her son Charles Cavendish.|$|E
5|$|As {{several other}} supernatural {{entities}} were also {{held responsible for}} bringing hail and torrential rains, when the entity is not explicitly named, it is often impossible to conclude to which the magical measures apply. There was, for example, a custom used when the approach of a thunderstorm was perceived: to bring a {{table in front of}} the house, and to put bread, salt, a knife with a black sheath, and an axe with its edge directed skywards on the table. By another custom, <b>a</b> <b>fireplace</b> trivet with its legs directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were put on the table.|$|E

50|$|A {{grid pattern}} of skylights, {{supported}} by sixteen free-standing cruciform steel columns, show {{concern for the}} play of light and shadow. <b>A</b> cylindrical <b>fireplace,</b> <b>a</b> 50-foot long storage wall, and the sunken conversation pit are key elements of the modern design of the central space.|$|R
5|$|In 1232 {{the castle}} was {{inherited}} by John's son, William de Braose, {{and in turn}} his son, also called William. In {{the second half of}} the century, Wales saw a renewal of fighting, and the castle was attacked again in 1251. The decision was taken to improve the castle's defences and, as part of this, a square, stone tower was added to the castle to provide living accommodation, with three chambers, the first floor containing a garderobe and <b>a</b> <b>fireplace.</b> A gateway was constructed through the curtain wall just to the south of the tower. Two further stone buildings were constructed within the castle walls.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, climbers {{found three}} {{buildings}} open {{on one side}} on Licancabur. They {{were built in the}} pirca style, where stones are fitted together without mortar. A woodpile was found between two of the buildings, which were described as two dwellings and <b>a</b> <b>fireplace.</b> Wood was also scattered around its crater. With the summit's panoramic view, which includes Calama and pass routes from Argentina, Licancabur may have been a watchtower for the Atacamenos. Its watchtower function may have been coordinated with fortresses in the area such as Lasana, Turi and a settlement identified in 1955 at Quebrada de Chaxas (northwest of the volcano). The settlement at Licancabur had a central courtyard, surrounded by buildings, and ceramics found there resemble these of Pukar√° de Quitor and Toconao Oriente. A tambo reportedly existed at the volcano.|$|E
5|$|Medieval {{construction}} was seasonal, work on site being undertaken {{only in the}} spring and summer, when the light was good and the weather more reliable. Each autumn, all exposed surfaces were covered and lagged against frost damage. The architects worked over winter in the tracing house (that of York has both <b>a</b> <b>fireplace</b> and a privy) to prepare designs for the next season's campaign. They translated the designs into sets of planed oak cross-sectional templates, which were given to the stone-cutters. Construction of cathedrals and major churches almost invariably started at the eastern arm, and then proceeded westwards, with towers erected last.|$|E

5|$|More {{and more}} state institutions, private firms, organizations, and clubs joined the {{procession}} each year, and the event {{began to take}} on the character of a public holiday. During the 1930s, the laying of badnjak on the fire became a court ritual. It was performed, {{in the presence of the}} royal family, by representatives of the army in the Royal Palace's room with <b>a</b> <b>fireplace.</b> At the end of the 1930s in some parts of Yugoslavia, especially Vojvodina and Montenegro, the military badnjak ceremony was performed not in the barracks yard but in a square in the garrison town. An open fire was built, on which the badnjak was placed by an Orthodox priest in the presence of soldiers and citizens. This tradition, symbolizing the unity of state, church, and people, was ended by the outbreak of WorldWarII.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1912, the new library {{opened on}} the {{property}} near Willamette University and the Oregon State Capitol, though construction on the structure was not completed, {{and much of the}} furniture had not been installed in the building. The completed structure included hardwood floors, crown molding, windows that were two-stories tall, and <b>a</b> <b>fireplace.</b> The library cost $30,000 to build, and within a year of operating had expanded to serve nearly 7,700 patrons with a collection of nearly 10,500 books. On January 4, 1920, a small fire damaged the furnace room and about 50 books at the library.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Walter Chrysler had {{a two-story}} {{apartment}} on the 69th and 70th floors with <b>a</b> <b>fireplace</b> and a private office. The office also contained a gymnasium and the tallest bathrooms in the world. Chrysler also had a triplex unit on the 58th through 60th floors, which served as his residence. However, Chrysler did not use his gym much, instead choosing {{to stay at the}} Chrysler Corporation's headquarters in Detroit. Later, the 69th and 70th floors were converted into a dental clinic. In 2005, a New York Times report found that one of the dentists, Charles Weiss, had operated at the clinic's current rooftop location since 1969. The office still had the suite's original bathroom and gymnasium.|$|E
