40|$|Sensitivity and {{specificity}} of <b>arm</b> circumference <b>indicators</b> in identifying malnourished 2 Frederick L. Trowbridge, 3 M. D. and Norman Staehling 4 ABSTRACT <b>Arm</b> circumference <b>indicators</b> of nutritional status such as simple arm circumfer-ence, arm circumference-for-age and arm circumference-for-height have advantages for field use {{because of their}} simplicity and low cost. However, these indicators need to be evaluated {{in terms of their}} ability to identify children who are malnourished by more accepted criteria such as weight-for-age and weight-for-height. This study used sensitivity-specificity analysis to evaluate <b>arm</b> circumference <b>indicators</b> in 3838 children 1 to 4 years of age in a rural area of El Salvador. It was found that simple arm circumference gave sensitivity-specificity results similar to arm circumfer-ence-for-age and generally better than arm circumference-for-height in identifying children with low weight-for-age. The three <b>arm</b> circumference <b>indicators</b> gave similar sensitivity-specificity results in identifying children with low weight-for-height. Linear correlations of the <b>arm</b> circum-ference <b>indicators</b> with weight-for-age and weight-for-height gave results which correspond to the results of sensitivity-specificity analysis, but the information obtained from correlations was les...|$|R

There were significant differences between these data sets in all studied variables. The results complement those reported previously for BMI and triceps skinfold and indicate that high prevalence of overweight in Dalmatians largely reflects their muscularity and skeletal robustness rather than excess body fatness. The {{findings suggest that the}} U. S. upper percentiles of BMI and skinfolds are inadequate for the assessment of excess body fatness in Dalmatian population. The obtained population-specific percentile distributions should be used provisionally as the reference data for group comparisons in the Dalmatian region...|$|R

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out on blindfolded human {{subjects}} to study the contribution of proprioceptive inputs from both arms in a forearm position matching task. Blindfolded matching accuracy was compared with accuracy when the subject could see their <b>indicator</b> (matching) <b>arm,</b> when they used a dummy arm for matching, and when they looked at {{a mirror image of}} the matching arm. The position of the mirror had been arranged so that the image of the <b>indicator</b> <b>arm</b> coincided with the position of the reference arm. None of these conditions significantly altered the matching errors. When reference elbow flexors were vibrated at 70 – 80 Hz, the illusion of extension of the vibrated arm reported by blindfolded subjects was significantly reduced by vision of the mirror image of the <b>indicator</b> <b>arm</b> or when using the dummy arm. It was concluded that visual information about the position of the <b>indicator</b> <b>arm,</b> or the apparent position of the reference arm, could reduce the size of the kinaesthetic illusion from vibration, but not abolish it. In a second experiment, subjects indicated, by tracking with their vibrated arm, the illusion of forearm extension evoked by elbow flexor vibration. It was found that the perceived speed of extension could be reduced by moving the indicator into extension and increased by moving it into flexion. These experiments demonstrate the importance for the matching process of the input provided by the <b>indicator</b> <b>arm.</b> Such a conclusion may help to explain some apparent discrepancies between observations made on position sense using one-arm and two-arm tasks. More broadly, this paper provides support for the idea that aspects of proprioceptive inputs from both arms are processed conjointly, as part of a strategy for use of the two hands as a single instrument in certain skilled tasks...|$|R
40|$|In {{clinical}} trials where patients are randomized between two treatment arms, not all patients {{comply with the}} treatment they were randomly assigned to. The reasons for (non) compliance {{may be associated with}} the outcome variable and thereby act as confounders. The standard way of analysing such trials is by the 'intention-to-treat' principle, which allows the use of permutation tests. Conclusions drawn from such tests do not depend on untested assumptions such as absence of confounding. However, this approach may yield biased estimators for the causal effects of treatments. We consider the estimation of such effects for {{clinical trials}} where non-compliers can be considered to have switched to the other trial arm. The most important example of this is the placebo-controlled clinical trial where no substantial placebo effects are anticipated. We consider the situation where the relationship between compliance, and thus treatment received, and outcome is influenced by unobserved confounders. The residual of the regression of the actual treatment indicator variable on the randomization <b>arm</b> <b>indicator</b> variable is shown to 'intercept' the effect of such confounders. Inclusion of this residual in a multivariate analysis, in conjunction with the treatment indicator variable, should thus adjust for confounding. Examples are given. In those examples, the results are similar to those obtained by more complex methods. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

The model shown is bidirectional, some types may have to be switched via a side lever to be able to measure in the opposite direction.|$|R
40|$|A reanalysis of the (seemingly very distant) {{open cluster}} Shorlin 1, {{the group of}} stars {{associated}} with WR 38 and WR 38 a, is {{made on the basis}} of existing UBV and JHKs observations for cluster members. The 2 MASS observations, in particular, imply a mean cluster reddening of E(B-V) = 1. 45 +- 0. 07 and a distance of 2. 94 +- 0. 12 kpc. The reddening agrees with the UBV results provided that the local reddening slope is described by E(U-B) /E(B-V) = 0. 64 +- 0. 01, but the distance estimates in the 2 MASS and UBV systems agree only if the ratio of total-to-selective extinction for the associated dust is R=Av/E(B-V) = 4. 0 +- 0. 1. Both results are similar to what has been obtained for adjacent clusters in the Eta Carinae region by similar analyses, which suggests that `anomalous' dust extinction is widespread through the region, particularly for groups reddened by relatively nearby dust. Dust associated with the Eta Carinae complex itself appears to exhibit more `normal' qualities. The results have direct implications for the interpretation of distances to optical spiral <b>arm</b> <b>indicators</b> for the Galaxy at l= 287 - 291 degrees, in particular the Carina arm here is probably little more than ~ 2 kpc distant, rather than 2. 5 - 3 kpc distant as implied in previous studies.

40|$|In a forearm position-matching {{task in the}} {{horizontal}} plane, when one (reference) arm is conditioned by contraction and length changes, subjects make systematic errors in the placement of their other, <b>indicator</b> <b>arm.</b> Here we describe experiments that demonstrate the importance not just of conditioning the reference arm, but of the <b>indicator</b> <b>arm</b> as well. Total errors from muscle conditioning represented up to {{a quarter of the}} angular range available to subjects. The sizes of the observed effects have led us to repeat other, previously reported experiments. In a matching task in the vertical plane, when muscles of both arms were conditioned identically, if the subject supported their arms themselves, or when the arms were loaded by the addition of weights, the loading did not introduce new position errors. To test the effect of exercise, subjects' elbow flexors were exercised eccentrically or concentrically by asking them to lower or raise a set of weights using forearm muscles. The exercise produced 25 – 30 % decreases in maximum voluntary contraction strength of elbow flexors and this led to significant position-matching errors. The directions and magnitudes of the errors were similar after the two forms of exercise and indicated that subjects perceived their exercised muscles to be longer than they actually were. To conclude, the new data from loading the arm are not consistent with the idea that the sense of effort accompanying support of a load, provides positional information in any simple way. Our current working hypothesis is that when muscles are active, position-sense involves operation of a forward internal model. Loading the arm produces predictable changes in motor output and afferent feedback whereas changes after exercise are unpredictable. This difference leads to exercise-dependent errors...|$|R

The group fed fish oil spent more time in the open arm area of the plus-maze than the group fed lard. Note that these results can also be interpreted as intake of lard increases anxiety-like behavior more than fish oil, depending on the perspective. Interestingly, the group fed soybean oil showed intermediate values between the fish oil-fed and lard-fed groups, and the differences between the soybean oil-fed and the other two groups were not statistically significant by post hoc ANOVA test.|$|R
40|$|It {{has often}} been argued that oil, gas and {{minerals}} may {{have a negative impact}} on development as measured by income per capita. This does not say much about sustainability, which is critical for developing countries whose economic growth derives primarily from the exploitation of exhaustible resources. We take adjusted net savings (ANS) per capita as an indicator of weak sustainability to examine the link between resource dependence and sustainable development, and look at specific governance and <b>armed</b> violence <b>indicators.</b> Since it is hard to dis-entangle the direct effect of governance on development in empirical studies, we use the relative size of the youth bulge as instrument. Our results highlight a negative relationship between natural resource exraction and ANS but indicate that this is not inevitable. Effective checks on the power of the executive appears to be critical for sus-tainable outcomes. Effective legislative chambers, an independent judiciary and broad acceptance of established institutions all have a positive impact on ANS per capita. Our results further confirm that armed conflict and armed violence as measured by the homicide rate {{have a negative impact on}} ANS. We conclude that extractive indus-tries and donor agencies should expand their focus from community-development programmes to strengthening checks-and-balance mechanisms, and suggest avenues to make extractive resources a stake for peace rather than for violent rent seeking...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} state militarization {{under conditions}} of ethnic and other diversity. Recent scholarship in economics finds that high diversity leads to lower provision of public goods. At the same time, conflict studies find that highly diverse societies face a lower risk of civil war despite the ‘primordialist’ claims about ancient hatreds, fear, and insecurity in such societies. Investigating possible links between these two separate lines of research, we explore whether diversity prompts governments to militarize heavily {{in order to prevent}} armed conflict, which would then crowd out spending on other public goods. Using military expenditures, personnel and <b>arms</b> imports as <b>indicators</b> of militarization, we find that higher levels of ethnic (and possibly linguistic) diversity predict lower levels of militarization, whereas religious diversity does not matter. If high diversity lowers the hazard of civil war, then it does not happen via a ‘garrison state’ effect. If diverse societies spend less on public goods, then this is not because they are crowded out by costly militarization. ...|$|R

40|$|After {{a period}} of {{eccentric}} exercise of elbow flexor muscles of one arm in young, adult human subjects, muscles became fatigued and damaged. Damage indicators were a fall in force, change in resting elbow angle and delayed onset of soreness. After the exercise, {{subjects were asked to}} match the forearm angle of one arm, whose position was set by the experimenter, with their other arm. Subjects matched the position of the unsupported reference arm, when this was unexercised, with a significantly more flexed position in their exercised <b>indicator</b> <b>arm.</b> Errors were in the opposite direction when the reference arm was exercised. The size of the errors correlated with the drop in force. Less consistent errors were observed when the reference arm was supported. A similar pattern of errors was seen after concentric exercise, which does not produce muscle damage. The data suggested that subjects were using as a position cue the perceived effort required to maintain a given forearm angle against the force of gravity. The fall in force from fatigue after exercise meant more effort was required to maintain a given position. That led to matching errors between the exercised and unexercised arms. It was concluded that while a role for muscle spindles in kinaesthesia cannot be excluded, detailed information about static limb position can be derived from the effort required to support the limb against the force of gravity...|$|R
40|$|In {{an earlier}} study of the spiral galaxy M 33, we photometrically {{identified}} arcs or outer spiral arms of intermediate age (0. 6 - 2 Gyr) carbon stars precisely at the commencement of the HI-warp. Stars in the arcs were unresolved, but were likely thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch carbon stars. Here we present Keck I spectroscopy of seven intrinsically bright and red target stars in the outer, northern arc in M 33. The target stars have estimated visual magnitudes as faint as V~ 25 ^(m). Absorption bands of CN are seen in all seven spectra reported here, confirming their carbon star status.

40|$|Proprioceptive signals {{coming from}} both arms {{are used to}} {{determine}} the perceived position of one arm in a two-arm matching task. Here, we examined whether the perceived position of one arm is affected by proprioceptive signals from the other arm in a one-arm pointing task in which participants specified the perceived position of an unseen reference <b>arm</b> with an <b>indicator</b> paddle. Both <b>arms</b> were hidden from the participant’s view throughout the study. In Experiment 1, with both arms placed in front of the body, the participants received 70 – 80 Hz vibration to the elbow flexors of the reference arm (= right arm) to induce the illu-sion of elbow extension. This extension illusion was compared with that when the left arm elbow flexors were vibrated or not. The degree of the vibration-induced extension illusion of the right arm was reduced in the presence of left arm vibration. In Experiment 2, we found that this kinesthetic interaction between the two arms did not occur when the left arm was vibrated in an abducted position. In Experiment 3, the vibration-induced extension illusion of one arm was fully developed when this arm was placed at an abducted position, indicating that the brain receives increased proprioceptive input from a vibrated arm even if the arm was abducted. Our results suggest that proprioceptive interaction between the two arms occurs in a one-arm pointing task when the two arms are aligned with one another. The position sense of one arm measured using a pointer appears to include the influences of incoming information from the other arm when both arms were placed in front of the body and parallel to one another...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK has {{recommended}} that the effectiveness of ongoing exercise referral schemes to promote physical activity should be examined in research trials. Recent empirical evidence {{in health care and}} physical activity promotion contexts provides a foundation for testing the feasibility and impact of a Self Determination Theory-based (SDT) exercise referral consultation. METHODS: An exploratory cluster randomised controlled trial comparing standard provision exercise referral with an exercise referral intervention grounded in Self Determination Theory. Individuals (N = 347) referred to an exercise referral scheme were recruited into the trial from 13 centres. Outcomes and processes of change measured at baseline, 3 and 6 -months: Minutes of self-reported moderate or vigorous physical activity (PA) per week (primary outcome), health status, positive and negative indicators of emotional well-being, anxiety, depression, quality of life (QOL), vitality, and perceptions of autonomy support from the advisor, need satisfaction (3 and 6 months only), intentions to be active, and motivational regulations for exercise. Blood pressure and weight were assessed at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS: Perceptions of the autonomy support provided by the health and fitness advisor (HFA) did not differ by arm. Between group changes over the 6 -months revealed significant differences for reported anxiety only. Within arm contrasts revealed significant improvements in anxiety and most of the Dartmouth CO-OP domains in the SDT arm at 6 months, which were not seen in the standard exercise referral group. A process model depicting hypothesized relationships between advisor autonomy support, need satisfaction and more autonomous motivation, enhanced well being and PA engagement at follow up was supported. CONCLUSIONS: Significant gains in physical activity and improvements in quality of life and well-being outcomes emerged in both the standard provision exercise referral and the SDT-based intervention at programme end. At 6 -months, observed between arm and within intervention <b>arm</b> differences for <b>indicators</b> of emotional health, and the results of the process model, were in line with SDT. The challenges in optimising recruitment and implementation of SDT-based training in the context of health and leisure services are discussed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{examining}} Modern Hebrew conflict and military terminology – {{the language of}} the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Described by many Israelis as “a language within the language”, it must necessarily possess an identity of its own through special characteristics. On this basis, the major ambition of this thesis has been to identify the special “fingerprint” of the army speak in Israel – both in regard to technical or grammatical aspects, as well as the practical use of the language. The reader also gets an insight in other various aspects of the language within the military establishment and the security and intelligence community. This includes the current status of the professional language in the armed forces, in regard to efforts made to establish a common strategic, operational and tactical language. The language of the IDF and its predecessors has developed under almost continuous armed conflicts, starting during the first waves of Jewish immigrants over a century ago. The focus on Hebrew education has been strong due to operational factors, but it has also been a central pillar in the civil-military relations for decades. With limited influence from other languages, {{the language of the}} IDF has developed characteristics of its own, compared to the daily Hebrew used in the civil society. The major characteristics found are the extensive use of acronyms, a generous use of slang and, to a less degree, the integration of loanwords. Additionally, there are minor factors, like IDF’s traditional use of numbers and naming of military material. This thesis claims that the IDF experienced problems with the implementation of a common professional language in the post-modern period of RMA, EBO and network-centric warfare. A {{part of the reason is}} the IDF officer education, their non-academic approach in general and dislike of learning material not found in Hebrew. An imprecise and unclear language has led to poor performance in the field, as in the Second Lebanon war in 2006. Today, the IDF have initiated efforts to meet the problems identified. In some areas, like the use of a clear language when issuing orders and coordination between different <b>arms,</b> there are <b>indicators</b> of improvement. In other areas, like the establishment of a common professional language within the IDF, it is far too early to make conclusions, as it is likely to require continuous efforts over a long period of time...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{accident}} risk, highway authorities prioritise maintenance budgets partly based upon previous accident history. However, as accident rates have continued to fall in most contexts, this approach has become problematic as accident ‘black spots’ have been treated {{and the number of}} accidents at any individual site has fallen. Another way of identifying sites of higher accident risk might be to identify near-miss accidents (where an accident nearly happened, but was avoided), which are likely to be much more prolific than actual accidents, therefore they are useful in identifying high-risk sites. The principal aim of this research is to analyse potentially unsafe truck driving conditions that involving harsh braking incidents (HBIs) that may indicate accident risk. Most modern truck fleets now record position as part of fleet management. This research used position data collected by a truck fleet management company for 8000 trucks in the United Kingdom (UK) over a 2 -year period (2011 - 2012) to identify incidents of harsh braking. This data was compared with STATS 19 accident data events (specifically truck accidents) occurring in 70 selected roundabouts (284 approaches) over an 11 -year period (2002 - 2012), to test the hypothesis that the HBIs could represent accident near-misses and therefore increased accident risk. The data used for model prediction comprised all vehicle accidents, truck accidents, HBIs, geometric properties, and traffic characteristics for whole roundabouts, within the circulatory lanes, and at approaches to the selected roundabouts. Random-parameters negative binomial (NB) count data models were used to estimate model parameters and the models were compared with fixed-parameters NB count data models. It was found that random-parameters count data models provide better goodness of fit and more variables were found to be significant, giving a better prediction of events. It is concluded that HBIs are influenced by traffic and geometric variables in a similar way to total and truck accidents, therefore they may be useful in considering accident risk at roundabouts. They are a source of higher volumes of data than accidents, which is important in considering changes or trends in accident risk over a much shorter time. The most important variables were Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) and percentage of truck traffic, which were found to have a positive influence on accidents and HBIs. Regarding the geometric variables, signalisation, circulatory roadway width, number of <b>arms</b> and two-lane <b>indicator</b> were the most important factors influencing accidents and HBIs. In addition to these models, numbers of HBIs was used as an independent variable in the models of total and truck accidents, along with traffic and geometric variables. From the results it can be concluded that at all approaches, HBIs are related to total accidents along with traffic and geometric variables, which can be used to study safety measures. A good predictive model for truck accidents at M-class approaches based on HBI, traffic and geometric parameters was identified {{that can be used for}} prioritising safety at these approaches in order to make roundabouts safer. For A- and B-class approaches a better fit model were identified when HBI were used as input variable along with traffic and geometric variables compared to the model without using HBI as input variable, but the influence of HBIs was negative (high HBIs with low numbers of accidents) which is probably an indicator of future accident risk in these locations. For at-grade roundabouts, a better fit model was obtained for total and truck accidents when it is compared to the model without HBIs, but the influence of HBIs was negative; this is probably an indicator of high accident risks in these at-grade roundabouts, however further investigation is required with more observations. These results for truck HBIs could help highway authorities to identify sites of increased accident risk more rapidly and without waiting for an accident history to develop...|$|R
