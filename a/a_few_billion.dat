5|$|Whenever {{the ratio}} of an object's mass to its radius becomes {{sufficiently}} large, general relativity predicts {{the formation of a}} black hole, a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape. In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution, neutron stars of around 1.4 solar masses, and stellar black holes with a few to a few dozen solar masses, are thought to be the final state for the evolution of massive stars. Usually a galaxy has one supermassive black hole with a few million to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>billion</b> solar masses in its center, and its presence is thought to have {{played an important role in}} the formation of the galaxy and larger cosmic structures.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the rings}} of Uranus {{appear to be}} young, they must be {{continuously}} renewed by the collisional fragmentation of larger bodies. The estimates show that the lifetime against collisional disruption of a moon with the size like that of Puck is <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>billion</b> years. The lifetime of a smaller satellite is much shorter. Therefore, all current inner moons and rings can be products of disruption of several Puck-sized satellites during the last four and half billion years. Every such disruption would have started a collisional cascade that quickly ground almost all large bodies into much smaller particles, including dust. Eventually the majority of mass was lost, and particles survived only in positions that were stabilized by mutual resonances and shepherding. The end product of such a disruptive evolution would be a system of narrow rings. However, a few moonlets must still be embedded within the rings at present. The maximum size of such moonlets is probably around 10km.|$|E

25|$|Conceivable {{levels of}} human-made climate forcing could yield the low-end runaway greenhouse. A forcing of 12–16 W m−2 would require carbon dioxide (CO2) levels to {{increase}} 8–16 times. If the forcing were due only to CO2 change, this {{would raise the}} global mean temperature by 16–24nbsp&°C with much larger polar warming. A warming of 16–24nbsp&°C produces a moderately moist greenhouse, with water vapour increasing to about 1% of the atmosphere's mass, thus increasing the rate of hydrogen escape to space. If such a forcing were entirely due to CO2, the weathering process would remove the excess atmospheric CO2 on a time scale of 104–105 years, well before the ocean was significantly depleted. Venus-like conditions on the Earth require a large long-term forcing that is unlikely to occur until the sun brightens by a few tens of percents, which will take <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>billion</b> years.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{calculations}} of period distribution for old accreting isolated neutron stars (INSs). At the age about <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>billions</b> years low velocity INSs {{come to the}} stage of accretion. At that stage their period evolution is governed by magnetic breaking and accreted angular momentum. Due to turbulence of the interstellar medium (ISM) accreted momentum can both accelerate and decelerate rotation of an INS and spin evolution has chaotic character. Calculations show that for constant magnetic fields INSs have relatively long spin periods, > 10 ^ 4 [...] 10 ^ 5 s, depending on parameters of INSs and an ISM. Due to long periods INSs have high spin up/spin down rates, which should fluctuate on a time scale about <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years.

25|$|An {{open cluster}} {{is a group}} of up to a few {{thousand}} stars that were formed from the same giant molecular cloud and have roughly the same age. More than 1,100 open clusters have been discovered within the Milky Way Galaxy, and many more are thought to exist. They are loosely bound by mutual gravitational attraction and become disrupted by close encounters with other clusters and clouds of gas as they orbit the galactic center. This can result in a migration to {{the main body of the}} galaxy and a loss of cluster members through internal close encounters. Open clusters generally survive for a few hundred million years, with the most massive ones surviving for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>billion</b> years. In contrast, the more massive globular clusters of stars exert a stronger gravitational attraction on their members, and can survive for longer. Open clusters have been found only in spiral and irregular galaxies, in which active star formation is occurring.|$|E
25|$|Very {{low mass}} stars are fully {{convective}} and {{may continue to}} fuse hydrogen into helium {{for up to a}} trillion years until {{only a small fraction of}} the entire star is hydrogen. Luminosity and temperature steadily increase during this time, just as for more-massive main-sequence stars, but the length of time involved means that the temperature eventually increases by about 50% and the luminosity by around 10 times. Eventually the level of helium increases to the point where the star ceases to be fully convective and the remaining hydrogen locked in the core is consumed in only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>billion</b> more years. Depending on mass, the temperature and luminosity continue to increase for a time during hydrogen shell burning, the star can become hotter than the Sun and tens of times more luminous than when it formed although still not as luminous as the Sun.

Lateral transfer is a significant factor in microbial evolution and is the mechanism of antibiotic resistance spread in bacteria species. In this paper we survey current methods designed to cope with lateral transfer in conjunction with vertical inheritance.

The sinogram images are analogous to the projections captured by computed tomography (CT) scanners, and can be reconstructed in a similar way.

Although the giant impact theory posits that the impact forming the Moon increased Earth's rotational speed to make a day about 5 hours long, the Moon has slowly [...] "stolen" [...] much of this speed to reduce Earth's solar day since then to about 24 hours and continues to do so: in 100 million years Earth's solar day will be roughly 24 hours 38 minutes (the same as Mars's solar day); in 1 billion years, 30 hours 23 minutes.

We performed a four-orbit reconnaissance with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope to study the stellar emission at Lyman-α, to assess the presence of hydrogen exospheres around the two inner planets, and to determine their UV irradiation. We detect the Lyman-α line of TRAPPIST- 1, making it the coldest exoplanet host star for which this line has been measured. We reconstruct the intrinsic line profile, showing that it lacks broad wings and is much fainter than expected from the stellar X-ray emission. TRAPPIST- 1 has a similar X-ray emission as Proxima Cen but a much lower Ly-α emission. This suggests that TRAPPIST- 1 chromosphere is only moderately active compared to its transition region and corona.
