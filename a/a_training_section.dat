During January the Sanitary Demonstration area, lectures and training films were utilized in the training program, since no other training aids were available. With the removal of CASA to the Presidio, early in February, use of the Fort Ord Sanitary Demonstration Area was eliminated. By {{the latter part of}} February, three other Sanitary Officers had reported for duty, Majors Milton O Lee and Howard E. Dorst, and Capt. W.R. Bradlee. The training program was then organized with four hours of instruction in water sanitation (Capt. Sheets), two hours in waste disposal(Capt.Bradlee), four hours in food sanitation (Maj. Lee), four hours in insect and rodent control (Maj. Dorst), and four hours in field sanitation by all of the above officers. Major Dorst, the senior officer, was designated Chief of Section, and Capt. Sheets continued as Property Officer. As more training equipment was received, floor space available in the Dispensary became inadequate and the Sanitary Training Section was moved to larger quarters in Building 5.|$|E

40|$|Research objective. To {{develop a}} model of students’ {{decision-making}} when individually choosing a sports section. Research methods: The study relies on the analysis of scientific and methodological literature, questionnaires, and factor analysis. The {{participants in the study}} were 55 first-year students (2015 enrollment year) of the School of Ukrainian Language and Literature of H. S. Skovoroda Kharkiv National Pedagogical University. Research results. The analysis of the questionnaires showed diverse motivational choices. The factor analysis revealed the prevailing motifs. The study comes up with a hierarchical model of students’ choice of <b>a</b> <b>training</b> <b>section</b> by a particular sport, and determines the system of subjective values of each student in points. Conclusions. The model developed by the hierarchy analysis allows to take into account all the variants of priorities in the students’ motivational choice. The method of hierarchy analysis allows to objectively process the subjective advantages seen by the students (who do not have any sports experience) when choosing <b>a</b> <b>training</b> <b>section</b> in the opted-for sport. This, in its turn, cultivates a steady motivation for physical education, allows to determine the required number of sports sections, and to distribute the educational and sports facilities at the higher educational university...|$|E

40|$|An {{automated}} detection {{process for}} Eukaryotic ribonucleic acid (RNA) Polymerase II Promoter {{is presented in}} this dissertation. We employ an artificial neural network (ANN) in conjunction with features that were selected using an information-theoretic approach. Firstly an introduction is given {{where the problem is}} described briefly. Some background is given about the biological and genetic principles involved in DNA, RNA and Promoter detection. The automation process is described with each step given in detail. This includes the data information gathering, feature generation, and the full ANN process. The ANN section of the project is split up in a generation process, <b>a</b> <b>training</b> <b>section</b> as well as a testing section. Lastly the final detection program was tested and compared to other promoter detection systems. An improvement of at least 10 % in positive prediction value (PPV) in comparison with current state-of-the-art solutions was obtained.

40|$|Delaying the {{presentation}} of information to one modality relative to another (an intersensory temporal offset) impairs performance {{on a wide range}} of tasks. We have recently shown, however, that a few minutes exposure to delayed visual feedback induces sensorimotor temporal adaptation, returning performance to normal. Here, we examine whether adaptation to delayed vestibular feedback is possible. Subjects were placed on a motion platform, and were asked to perform a stabilization task. The task was similar to balancing a rod on the tip of your finger. Specifically, the platform acted as if it were on the end of an inverted pendulum, with subjects applying an acceleration to the platform via a joystick. The more difficulty one has in stabilizing the platform the more it will oscillate, increasing the variability in the platform's position. The experiment was divided into 3 sections. During the Baseline section (5 minutes), subjects performed the task with immediate vestibular feedback. They then were presented with <b>a</b> <b>Training</b> <b>section,</b> consisting of 4 sessions (5 minutes each) during which vestibular feedback was delayed by 500 ms. Finally, subjects were presented with a Post-test (two minutes) with no feedback delay. Subjects performed rather well in the Baseline section (average standard deviation of platform tilt was 1. 37 degrees). The introduction of the delay greatly impaired performance (8. 81 degrees standard deviation in the 1 st Training session), but performance rapidly showed significant improvement (5. 59 degrees standard deviation during the last training section, p< 0. 04). Subjects clearly learned to compensate, at least partially, for the delayed vestibular feedback. Performance during the Post-test was worse than during Baseline (2. 48 degrees standard deviation in tilt). This decrease suggests that the improvement seen during training might be the result of intersensory temporal adaptation...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} rapdily and {{accurately}} {{interact with the}} world, we need to perceive the consequences of our actions. It should not be surprising, then, that delaying the consequences of our actions, or delaying feedback about our actions, impairs performance {{on a wide range}} of tasks. We have recently shown that a few minutes exposure to delayed visual feedback induces sensorimotor temporal adaptation, returning performance to near normal levels. While visual feedback plays a large role in many tasks, there are some tasks for which vestibular perception is more critical. Here, we examine whether adaptation to delayed vestibular feedback is possible. To test for vestibular temporal adaptation, subjects were placed on a motion platform and were asked to perform a stabilization task. The task was similar to balancing a rod on the tip of your finger. Specifically, the platform acted as if it were on the end of an inverted pendulum. Subjects moved the platform by applying an acceleration to it via a joystick. The experiment was divided into 3 sections. During the Baseline section, which lasted 5 minutes, subjects performed the task with immediate vestibular feedback. They then were presented with <b>a</b> <b>Training</b> <b>section,</b> which consisted of 4 sessions (5 minutes each) during which vestibular feedback was delayed by 500 ms. Finally, subjects performance on the task with immediate feedback was remeasured during a 2 minute Post-test. The more difficulty one has in stabilizing the platform the more it will oscillate, increasing the variablilty in the platform's position and orientation. Accordingly, positional variance served as the primary measure of the subjects' performance. Subjects did rather well in the Baseline section (average standard deviation of platform tilt was 1. 37 degrees). The introduction of the delay greatly impaired performance (8. 81 degrees standard deviation in the 1 st Training session), but performance rapidly showed significant improvement (5. 59 degrees standard deviation during the last training session). Subjects clearly learned to compensate, at least partially, for the delayed vestibular feedback. Performance during the Post-test showed a negative aftereffect: The performance with a 500 ms delay worse during the Post-test than during Baseline (2. 48 degrees versus 1. 37 degreees), suggesting that the improvement seen during training was the result of intersensory temporal adaptation...|$|E
