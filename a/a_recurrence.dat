5|$|Women with {{endometrial cancer}} {{should not have}} routine {{surveillance}} imaging to monitor the cancer unless new symptoms appear or tumor markers begin rising. Imaging without these indications is discouraged because {{it is unlikely to}} detect <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> or improve survival, and because it has its own costs and side effects.

40|$|Purpose. To assess {{reactivation}} {{rates and}} time to progression for patients treated with intravitreal gancyclovir for the induction and maintenance therapy of CMV retinitis. Methods. A retrospective chart review was done on patients treated exclusivally with intravitreal gancyclovir at McGill University between 1991 and 1994. Results. 39 patients received intravitreal gancyclovir during the study period. 19 / 36 (53 %) patients had <b>a</b> primary <b>recurrence,</b> <b>an</b> average of 123. 6 d following initial induction therapy. 9 / 17 (53 %) patients had <b>a</b> secondary <b>recurrence,</b> <b>an</b> average of 87. 1 d following reinduction therapy. 4 / 6 (66 %) patients had <b>a</b> tertiary <b>recurrence,</b> <b>an</b> average of 34. 1 d following secondary reinduction. Second eye involvement was 36 %, systemic CMV disease occured in 6 %, and ocular complications occured in 15 %. Conclusion. The time to recurrence with intravitreal gancylovir therapy accelerates over time. Reactivation rates, time to recurrence, ocular complications and second eye involvement with intravitreal gancylovir therapy are comparable with standard intravenous therapy.

5|$|Before Tropical Storm Danielle {{moved through}} the Lesser Antilles, a small-craft {{advisory}} was issued, and later, gale warnings were posted for Barbados as well as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

Further west, Danielle briefly posed a threat to Jamaica, prompting officials in that country to issue a tropical storm watch.

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also binds to the hemeprotein myoglobin. It {{has a high}} {{affinity for}} myoglobin, about 60 times {{greater than that of}} oxygen. Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen. This causes reduced cardiac output and hypotension, which may result in brain ischemia. A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.|$|E

5|$|In 1890 the Prison Commissioners {{agreed to}} declare Clifford's Tower a {{national}} monument and to conserve it as a historic location. In 1902 Clifford's Tower {{was given to}} the York Corporation, together with a grant of £3,000 (£242,000 at 2009 prices) arranged by Lord Wenlock for conservation and repairs. The removal of the talus and the damage to the castle stonework in the 16th century had put excessive pressure on the supporting motte, causing <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> of the 14th century subsidence. Sir Basil Mott, a leading Victorian engineer, installed concrete underpinnings to stabilise the structure beneath the gatehouse. By the early 20th century, Clifford's Tower was regularly open to visitors, and in 1915 it was passed to the Office of Works as a national monument.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To analyze {{patterns}} {{and frequency of}} recurrences of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the vulva after wide local excision (WLE) and superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy with separate incisions and to identify prognostic factors {{for the development of}} recurrences. Methods. Between January 1985 and December 1999, all 125 consecutive patients with primary SCC of the vulva, treated with WLE and superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy, were retrospectively analyzed. Recurrences were registered by localization as: local, skin bridge, groin or distant. Results. <b>A</b> local <b>recurrence</b> was diagnosed in 29 (23 %) patients, 11 (9 %) developed a groin and 4 (3 %) <b>a</b> distant <b>recurrence.</b> No skin bridge recurrences were identified. The 5 years local relapse-free survival was 70 %. After <b>a</b> first local <b>recurrence,</b> 72 % of these patients developed <b>a</b> second local <b>recurrence.</b> Adjusted for other predictors, older age (> 74 years) is an independent risk factor for local recurrences (HR: 2. 38; 95 %-C. 1. : 1. 08 - 5. 23) and stage III/IV cancer for developing groin/distant recurrences (HR: 3. 03; 95 %-C. I. : 1. 0 - 9. 18). Conclusion. WLE and superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy with separate incisions result in <b>a</b> high groin <b>recurrence</b> rate in this study; superficial lymphadenectomy should be replaced by deep inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. After <b>a</b> local <b>recurrence,</b> 72 % of the patients developed <b>a</b> second local <b>recurrence.</b> These patients are at high risk and need a close follow-up. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Wes Durston, who replaced Trescothick in the side, top-scored for Somerset in their next match, making 57. Only two other players reached double-figures for the county, and the Diamond Eagles chased down the total with eight balls to spare.

5|$|A {{product of}} Manchester United's youth academy, Campbell progressed to their first-team in the 2006–07 season. He made four {{appearances}} without scoring in his {{tenure at the}} club. He had a loan spell at Belgian club Royal Antwerp, where he scored 24 goals in 38 appearances. He also had loan periods with Hull City and Tottenham Hotspur, where he scored 15 goals in 37 matches and three goals in 22 appearances respectively. He signed for Sunderland {{at the beginning of}} the 2009–10 season for £3.5million. His involvement at Sunderland was limited due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury he sustained in his second season at the club, as well as <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> of the same problem later in the season.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>recurrence</b> of {{the effects}} of his injury in 1924 {{restricted}} Gilligan's cricket in 1925. Appearing in fewer games and bowling far less frequently than in previous seasons, he scored 542 runs at 15.05 and took only eight wickets. He bowled in the first four games of the season, but in his remaining seventeen appearances played only as a batsman. In 1926, he was more successful and his performances helped Sussex to rise from thirteenth to tenth in the County Championship. Playing more games, he scored 1,037 runs at 30.50, the highest seasonal batting average of his career, and took 75 wickets at 20.74. That season, although no longer considered for a place in the England team himself, Gilligan joined the panel of Test selectors, and as a consequence missed some cricket for Sussex. He published a book on that summer's tour by Australia called Collins's Men.|$|E
5|$|After {{participating}} in Canada's Olympic summer camp before the season, Iginla again set new personal highs in 2001–02 when he registered 52goals and 96points. This season elevated Iginla to superstar status. He earned the Art Ross and Maurice Richard trophies as the NHL's leading point and goal scorer, respectively. He was also awarded the Lester B.

The Hart Trophy voting proved to be controversial: Iginla tied Canadiens goaltender José Théodore in voting points, but received fewer first place votes than Théodore. However, one voter, rumoured to be from Quebec—Théodore and the Canadiens' home province—inexplicably left Iginla off his ballot.
