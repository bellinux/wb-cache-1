5|$|At {{the same}} time that the first issue of New Worlds <b>appeared,</b> <b>a</b> {{separate}} British magazine called Fantasy was launched by Walter Gillings, a science fiction fan and a reporter by profession. Fantasy lasted for only three issues before dying in 1947, but Gillings had accumulated a substantial inventory of stories—enough to fill nine issues. Gillings followed the demise of Fantasy by publishing a fanzine, titled Fantasy Review, beginning in March 1947.|$|E

5|$|His science-fiction book-writing {{career began}} in 1965 with the {{publication}} of a short-story anthology, Jad mantezji (The Venom of Mantesia), which included stories from Młody Technik and some others that had already <b>appeared</b> <b>a</b> year earlier in another anthology. By 1982 he had published four more collections: Przejście przez lustro (Through the Mirror, 1975); Iluzyt (1976); Feniks (The Phoenix, 1981); and Ogon diabła (The Devil's Tail, 1982).|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the problem}} was that Bordeaux may not have <b>appeared</b> <b>a</b> {{plausible}} Allied target because it was out of range of fighter aircraft cover from the United Kingdom. Historian Terry Crowdy's analysis is that Ironside may have suffered simply from lack of resources. In common with other, higher-impact, Bodyguard deceptions it preyed on a concern that the Allies knew Hitler and the German High Command had discussed. Crowdy suggests that with physical deception, and more effort, Ironside could have succeeded {{in the same way as}} deceptions aimed against Calais, Normandy and the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The {{casualties}} {{suffered by}} the two combatants are difficult to determine, due to several factors. In regard to the Germans, equipment losses were {{complicated by the fact}} that they made determined efforts to recover and repair tanks. For example, tanks disabled one day often <b>appeared</b> <b>a</b> day or two later repaired. German personnel losses are clouded by the lack of access to German unit records, which were seized at the end of the war. Many were transferred to the United States national archives and were not made available until 1978, while others were taken by the Soviet Union, which declined to confirm their existence.|$|E

5|$|The lead {{would be}} {{augmented}} {{in the sixth}} when Carl Crawford hit a line drive that just cleared the right field wall for a home run. Though it <b>appeared</b> <b>a</b> fan may have reached over the wall to catch it, NL manager Tony La Russa did not challenge the umpires' call. The NL got a run back {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Carlos Beltrán led off with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Griffey. The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when Víctor Martínez hit a two-run home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5–2 lead.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} from injury, Bolt <b>appeared</b> <b>a</b> reduced figure {{at the start of}} the 2015 season. He ran only two 100m and three 200m before the major championship. He opened with 10.12 seconds for the 100m and 20.20 for the 200m. He won the 200m in New York and Ostrava, but his season's best time of 20.13 seconds ranked him 20th in the world going into the championships. Two 100m runs of 9.87 in July in London showed better form, but in comparison, Justin Gatlin was easily the top ranked {{sprinter}} – the American had times of 9.74 and 19.57 seconds, and had already run under 9.8 seconds on four occasions that season. Bolt entered the World Championships to defend his sprint titles but was not the comfortable favourite he had been since 2008.|$|E
5|$|The old king's estrangement {{from his}} three daughters {{from his first}} {{marriage}} (Princesses Louise, Stéphanie, and Clémentine) spurred Leopold to keep or give as much wealth away as possible in order to disinherit the girls. An Austrian newspaper claimed that right before he died, Leopold personally gave Caroline his large collection of personal letters as well as documents detailing information about various European royal figures, which greatly worried his eldest daughter. After his death, the three princesses sued his estate for several million francs, although this was only a very small portion compared with the fortune he accumulated. The fortune was so large that the princesses were still attempting to recover some of Caroline's wealth four years after their father's death, claiming that Caroline and Durrieux had speedily ransacked one of Leopold's properties in Paris and seized important financial documents before the Belgian envoy to France <b>appeared.</b> <b>A</b> trust of $10,000,000 the king had placed in Caroline and their two sons' names became a target of the princesses; they and the Belgian government argued that the trust formed part of Leopold's private estate, and thus all three girls and the government had a right to their share, as its funds had derived from the Congo Free State. The Belgian government's lawsuit succeeded, allowing them to collect the entire trust, but it also diminished the share the princesses received (as each collected a comparatively meager $1,000,000). Belgian statesman Emile Vandervelde later charged in an open letter that Leopold had given Caroline $6,000,000 worth of Congo bonds which had been found to be previously missing when Belgium annexed the colony.|$|E
