5000|$|The {{certification}} {{process is}} carried out by VHPready Services GmbH and <b>approved</b> <b>testing</b> <b>laboratories.</b> After receiving an application for the VHPready certificate, VHPready Services GmbH will instruct <b>testing</b> <b>laboratories</b> to <b>test</b> the plants {{on the basis of}} the VHPready-technical requirements. The process is divided in two parts: the first part consists of static conformance tests, where the systems and their properties are checked against the specifications provided by the VHPready standard, followed by verification of the dynamic properties of the system, meaning tests under controlled conditions. [...] In the second part end-to-end tests are done with the aid of reference systems. After successful testing and approval of the testing report by VHPready Services GmbH the plants will receive a product-related VHPready certificate. If the product offered by a plant is changed, then the prequalification process needs to be redone.|$|R
5000|$|The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (Common Criteria or CC) is an {{international}} standard (International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 15408) for computer security certification. Common Criteria allows specifying and verifying vendor claims relating to security functionality and assurance requirements. Verification of claims is performed using <b>approved</b> <b>testing</b> <b>laboratories.</b> [...] The Evaluation Assurance Level of EAL4 permits the developer to gain maximum assurance from positive security engineering based on good commercial development practices which, though rigorous, do not require substantial specialist knowledge, skills, and other resources. EAL4 is the highest level at which {{it is likely to}} be economically feasible to retrofit to an existing product line. EAL4 is therefore applicable in those circumstances where developers or users require a moderate to high level of independently assured security in conventional commodity TOEs and are prepared to incur additional security-specific engineering costs. Augmented with ALC_FLR.2 establishes and verifies the claim that the developer has established flaw remediation procedures that describe the tracking of security flaws, the identification of corrective actions, and the distribution of corrective action information to TOE users.|$|R
50|$|The IEC 60601-1 {{standard}} {{requires that}} two independent precautionary measures (Means of Patient Protection, or MOPPs) {{are set in}} place, to protect the patient from electrical shock in the medical system. A network isolator can be constructed to provide one or both required MOPPs. In the case where only a single MOPP is present in a system, a second measure of protection for the medical device must be made. This can be achieved, for example, by installing a fixed, low-resistance earthing cable, bar, or strap, {{referred to as a}} potential equalisation conductor. Conformation to the requirements of applicable standards and guidelines, in particular the IEC 60601-1 standard, involves manufacturers themselves declaring CE compliance and/or gaining certification from an <b>approved</b> independent <b>testing</b> <b>laboratory.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} primary types of devices. The most common are the types {{specified}} by ASME (American Society Of Mechanical Engineers), utilizing baffles, or a proprietary inlet diffuser. [...] Grease trap sizing {{is based on}} the size of the 2- or 3-compartment sink, dishwasher, pot sinks, and mop sinks. The cumulative flow rates of these devices, as well as overall grease retention capacity (in pounds or kilograms) are considered. Currently, ASME Standard (ASME A112.14.3) is being adopted by both of the National Model Plumbing Codes that cover most of the US. This standard requires that grease interceptors remove a minimum of 90% of incoming FOGS (fats, oils and greases). It also requires that grease interceptors are third-party tested and certified to 90 days compliance with the standard pumping. This third-party testing must be conducted by a recognized and <b>approved</b> third-party <b>testing</b> <b>laboratory.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{simple and}} rapid stability-indicating LC-analytical method was {{developed}} for the simultaneous determination of flucloxacillin (fluc) and amoxicillin (amox) in bulk and pharmaceutical dosage form. A chromatographic separation of the two drugs was achieved with a Thermosil C 18 (4. 6 mm× 250 mm, 5 μm) analytical column using potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (adjusted to pH 3 by ortho phosphoric acid) :methanol (70 : 30 %, v/v) in isocratic mode at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and column at ambient temperature. The detection was monitored at 225 nm using a PDA detector. The stressed samples were analyzed for the degradation study in acid, base, peroxide, thermal, photolytic and validated as per ICH guideline. This proposed method {{was found to be}} specific and stability-indicating as no interfering peaks of degradation compounds and excipients were noticed. The described method shows excellent linearity over a range of 20 – 100 μg/mL for both drugs. The correlation coefficient for fluc and amox was 0. 9992 and 0. 9993, respectively. The mean recovery value for fluc and amox was 99. 9 % and 99. 7 %, respectively. The limit of detection for fluc and amox was 0. 018 and 0. 009 μg/mL and the limit of quantification was 0. 06 and 0. 03 μg/mL, respectively. The retention time was observed at 2. 582 and 3. 407 min for amox and fluc, respectively. The robustness study and percentage of assay of the formulation were found within limit as per ICH guidelines. The proposed method was suitable for quantitative determination and it can be applied in quality control department in industries, <b>approved</b> <b>testing</b> <b>laboratories,</b> bio-pharmaceutics and bio-equivalence and clinical pharmacokinetic studies...|$|R
50|$|Model 251 engine {{design was}} {{initiated}} in 1949, {{and like the}} 244 engine {{it would have a}} bore (cylinder diameter) of 9 in, and a stroke of 10.5 in. Its designation combines Alco's identifier for that bore and stroke - 2 - with the year its design was <b>approved</b> for <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> - 1951. Chief Engineer of Diesel Engine Design, Paul Vaughan, designed the 251 to improve upon the major weaknesses of the 244. A wet block design was used to address severe thermal differences which existed in the dry block 244. The welded block and base was kept, as was the four-point mounting. New in the 251 was an intercooler for the turbocharger, which minimized temperature differentials but also benefitted performance. Many small improvements were made to the crankshaft, bearings, pistons, injectors and camshafts.|$|R

5000|$|Design {{work on the}} 241, {{began in}} 1940, {{initially}} led by Ralph Miller, who was shortly thereafter replaced by Paul Vaughan. Alco Engineer Paul Vaughan did a study to recommend a diesel engine specification. His recommendation was for a high speed, 9" [...] X 10.5" [...] V-type diesel engine operating at a maximum of 1,000 rpm with a 45 degree angle between the two cylinder banks. Alco's first attempt at attaining 1500 horsepower in a diesel engine was with the Alco 241 engine program. The 241 engine was approved for development on March 12, 1940. The company authorized both 12 cylinder and 16 cylinder designs. The Alco 241 engine would have a bore (cylinder diameter) of 9 in, and a stroke of 10.5 in. It's designation combines Alco's identifier for that bore and stroke - 2 - with the year its design was <b>approved</b> for <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> - 1941.
