5|$|In 1978 Robert Randall {{sued the}} federal {{government}} for arresting him for using cannabis to treat his glaucoma. The judge ruled Randall needed cannabis for medical purposes and required the Food and Drug <b>Administration</b> <b>set</b> up a program to grow cannabis on a farm at the University of Mississippi and to distribute 300 cannabis cigarettes a month to Randall. In 1992 George H. W. Bush discontinued the program after Randall tried to make HIV/AIDS patients eligible for the program. Thirteen people were already enrolled and were allowed to continue receiving cannabis cigarettes; today the government still ships cannabis cigarettes to four people. Irvin Rosenfeld, who became eligible to receive cannabis from the program in 1982 to treat rare bone tumors, urged the George W. Bush administration to reopen the program; however, he was unsuccessful.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{intensive}} care patients, enteral feeding requires sterile feedings because of infectious complications and adequate supplements to meet nutritional needs. Heretofore, prepacked, large-volume formula containers were developed, but bacterial contamination occurred in 4 % to 15 %. Our {{objective was to}} investigate the microbial contamination rate of 1 -L feeding bottles and newly designed <b>administration</b> <b>sets</b> over hanging times of 24 hrs in the {{intensive care}} unit (ICU). DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to the ICU of a university hospital. PATIENTS: All consecutive patients fed via a nasojejunal tube for at least 4 days. MEASUREMENTS: Cultures of feeding bottles, <b>administration</b> <b>sets,</b> and gastric and tracheobronchial aspirates at day 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7. RESULTS: A total of 4 % of feeding bottles and 74 % of infusion sets contained > 10 (2) colony forming units (CFU) /mL. Gastric and bronchial aspirates were positive in 90 % and 92 %, respectively. Bacterial counts of feeding bottles were 10 (2) - 10 (5) CFU/mL, and the main bacteria isolated included Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and enterococci. One third of all cultured bacteria in feeding bottles, <b>administration</b> <b>sets,</b> stomach, and lungs belonged to the Enterobacteriaceae family, which was held responsible for the nosocomial infections in the ICU. None of the 1 -L feeding bottles with a hanging time of 19 - 24 hrs was contaminated. Only bottles that had to be exchanged because of need for a faster rate of infusion proved to be contaminated, apparently without clinical consequences. With time and the increasing severity of disease, the <b>administration</b> <b>sets</b> became contaminated at an increasingly faster rate and with higher bacterial counts mainly through retrograde growth of endogenous bacteria. The final step of bottle contamination might have been the bacterial transfer by nurses' hands. CONCLUSION: Despite an almost ideal design of the enteral nutrition delivery system, a 4 % contamination rate of initially sterile feedings with clinically relevant bacteria and the fact that only manipulated systems showed bacterial growth are of concer...|$|R

While the population had quadrupled during 1830 to 1867, the size of the civil service in Singapore had remained unchanged. In 1850 there were only twelve police officers to keep order in a city of nearly 60,000. Most people had no access to public health services and disease such as cholera and smallpox caused severe health problem, especially in overcrowded working-class areas. Malnutrition and opium smoking were major social woes during this period.|$|E
