50|$|In contrast, the tax-free <b>allowances</b> <b>paid</b> during {{overseas}} assignments (especially {{the housing}} allowances) are {{generally considered to}} be an incentive to serve overseas, as they can be quite generous. While this situation may be advantageous to some personnel during their assignment overseas, these tax-free allowances are not considered to be part of one's salary, therefore they are not counted when computing a civil service annuity at retirement. CONUS locality adjustments, however, are counted when computing annuities.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the determinants of}} teacher exits from and mobility within the Queensland state school system. In common with previous research we find that non-pecuniary factors, such as class size and location, affect movement decisions but our results suggest a significant role for pecuniary factors. In particular, higher wages reduce exits from the public sector, {{especially in the case}} of more experienced female teachers. Locality <b>allowances</b> <b>paid</b> to teachers in rural and remote schools, where non-pecuniary factors are less attractive, appear to have some success in attracting and retaining staff in these locations. ...|$|R
50|$|Reference to {{salaries}} paid {{to higher}} ranks {{is not made}} in the Dockyard Police Regulation Book but old dockyard standing orders show that in 1845 the Lieutenant Director was in receipt of £250 per annum plus fringe benefits—in the form of 15 pence per night subsistence <b>allowance</b> <b>paid</b> for duties which {{kept him out of}} the yard all night—together with expenses incurred in boat or carriage hire. A similar order, dated 6 December 1858 gives details of a pay rise for Serjeants who received £1.4s.6d. for a seven-day week. No mention is made of Inspectors.|$|R
50|$|The {{term was}} {{originally}} used in Britain in the 1920s to distinguish New feminists from traditional mainstream suffragist feminism. These women, {{also referred to}} as welfare feminists, were particularly concerned with motherhood, like their opposite numbers in Germany at the time, Helene Stöcker and her Bund für Mutterschutz. New feminists campaigned strongly in favour of such measures as family <b>allowances</b> <b>paid</b> directly to mothers. They were also largely supportive of protective legislation in industry. A major proponent of this was Eleanor Rathbone of the suffragist-successor society, the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship.|$|R
50|$|The {{composer}} Johann Sebastian Bach {{lived at}} two addresses during his stay in Köthen, Germany, {{while he was}} working for Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen. The first of these properties has been demolished, so Bach House (German: Bachhaus Köthen) normally refers to the extant building which the composer occupied in the period 1719-23. This property is on Wallstraße (Wall Street) and was completed in 1719: Bach is assumed to have been the first tenant of the house. Documentary evidence of the <b>allowances</b> <b>paid</b> to Bach suggests that the house was also used by the court orchestra.|$|R

It is, however, {{probable}} that the extra <b>allowances</b> <b>paid</b> {{to some of our}} higher officers when on duty may give to their positions for a time a higher pecuniary remuneration. It will of course be understood that {{there is nothing in the}} American army answering to our colonel of a regiment. With us the officer so designated holds a nominal command of high dignity and emolument as a reward for past services.|$|R

40|$|Merchandising <b>allowances</b> are fees <b>paid</b> by {{manufacturers}} to retailers {{in order to}} encourage the allocation of in-store promotional activities to the manufacturers' brand. I use a three-stage game framework to formulate a vertical structural model, which endogenizes manufacturer, retailer, and consumer decisions in the presence of merchandising allowances. The model allows for non-linear vertical pricing contracts using merchandising <b>allowances</b> <b>paid</b> to retailers. This differs from previous work which has focused on franchise fees paid to manufacturers. The model is estimated using store-level weekly data from the ketchup industry. In addition to estimates of consumer taste parameters, the model also yields predictions of wholesale prices and the size (dollar value) of the merchandising allowances. Counterfactual simulations reveal that merchandising allowances lead to an increase in retail profits, a decline in manufacturer profits, a decline in consumer surplus, and reduction in total welfare. ...|$|R

The taxpayer helped meet {{the cost of a}} full-time housekeeper. Other allegations included expenses for work done to Hogg’s stables and for his piano to be tuned. He generously spent or perhaps somewhat overspent on his farm and home office: Hogg agreed a deal with the expenses office simply to have one twelfth of the second homes <b>allowance</b> <b>paid</b> into his bank account every month.|$|R
