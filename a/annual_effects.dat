To assess the effects of trial year and location on quality evaluation data, a data base consisting of quality data from Dutch malting and brewing trials of new malting barley varieties during the period 1989 - 1995 was analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques. It was also determined which parameters gave little or no discrimination among varieties over the years. The analysis showed that strong <b>annual</b> <b>effects</b> occurred over the period observed. A considerable list of 23 analytical parameters from barley, malt, wort, and beer analysis were relevant to explain 50 % {{of the variance in}} the data set. Seven parameters showed hardly any variation and possessed no discriminative value. This indicated that the number of parameters could be diminished to some extent without losing resolving power with respect to quality evaluation. A further reduction is possible when, of two parameters showing high positive or negative correlations, only one is analyzed. Quality data from different trial locations were prone to <b>annual</b> <b>effects.</b> The trends observed showed clustering of data from particular trial locations with discrimination among locations in certain years. From this evaluation, it could not yet be concluded whether or not a limitation in the number of trial sites is feasible.

We determined whether egg and nestling survival differed between years with a Gehan-Wilcoxon test. By Cox regressions, we related the survival times with nest and colony features.

40|$|The Norwegian {{spring-spawning}} (NSS) herring (Clupea harengus), {{blue whiting}} (Micromesistius poutassou) and Northeast Atlantic (NEA) mackerel (Scomber scombrus) are extremely abundant pelagic planktivores that feed in the Norwegian Sea (NS) during spring and summer. This {{study investigated the}} feeding ecology and diet composition of these commercially important fish stocks {{on the basis of}} biological data, including an extensive set of stomach samples in combination with hydrographical data, zooplankton samples and acoustic abundance data from 12 stock monitoring surveys carried out in 2005 - 2010. Mackerel were absent during the spring, but had generally high feeding overlap with herring in the summer, with a diet mainly based on calanoid copepods, especially Calanus finmarchicus, as well as a similar diet width. Stomach fullness in herring diminished from spring to summer and feeding incidence was lower than that of mackerel in summer. However, stomach fullness did not differ between the two species, indicating that herring maintain an equally efficient pattern of feeding as mackerel in summer, but on a diet that is less dominated by copepods and is more reliant on larger prey. Blue whiting tended to have a low dietary overlap with mackerel and herring, with larger prey such as euphausiids and amphipods dominating, and stomach fullness and feeding incidence increasing with length. For all the species, feeding incidence increased with decreasing temperature, and for mackerel so did stomach fullness, indicating that feeding activity is highest in areas associated with colder water masses. Significant <b>annual</b> <b>effects</b> on diet composition and feeding-related variables suggested that the three species are able to adapt to different food and environmental conditions. These <b>annual</b> <b>effects</b> are likely to have an important impact on the predation pressure on different plankton groups and the carrying capacity of individual systems, and emphasise the importance of regular monitoring of pelagic fish diets...|$|E

30|$|Although we did {{not find}} autoregressive <b>annual</b> <b>effects</b> in our {{regression}} models, the most extensive burning in the SSPMNP occurred in fire seasons preceded by drier than average periods. In 1989, 1999, and 2006, the previous 12 months brought between 62 % and 69 % of the long-term average in precipitation. An average precipitation year occurred before 2003 (96 % of the long-term average), but the three previous years had experienced a record drought, such that the mean annual precipitation for the previous four years had been only 59 % of normal. Similarly, Skinner et al. (2008), in a tree ring analysis of the period 1700 through 1990 in the SSPMNP, concluded that periods of widespread fire were drier than normal, and wetter periods tended to experience few fires, although wet periods also positively influenced future fire activity at a 5 -year lag, probably due to effects on litter quantity. Skinner et al. (2008) also found that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and El Niño-Southern Oscillation interacted to influence shifts from high to low fire activity.|$|E

For the site with the most complex terrain, the average annual wind shear varied up to 7 % between different years.
