50|$|In the Viking Age, {{women are}} likely to have played the main role in the wight faith. This faith {{included}} sacrifices of food and drink on certain locations either near the farm or other places like waterfalls and groves where wights were believed to live. During Christianisation the attention of the missionaries was focused on the named gods; worship of the more <b>anonymous</b> <b>collective</b> groups of deities was allowed to continue for a while, and could have later escaped notice by the Christian authorities. The wights also lived on in folklore as nixies and tomter.|$|R
5000|$|Collaborative {{intelligence}} {{is a term}} used in several disciplines. In business it describes heterogeneous networks of people interacting to produce intelligent outcomes. It can also denote non-anonymous multi-agent problem-solving systems. The term was used in 1999 to describe the behavior of an intelligent business ecosystem where Collaborative Intelligence, or CQ, is [...] "the ability to build, contribute to and manage power found in networks of people." [...] When the computer science community adopted the term collective intelligence and gave that term a specific technical denotation, a complementary term was needed to distinguish between <b>anonymous</b> homogeneity in <b>collective</b> prediction systems and non-anonymous heterogeneity in collaborative problem-solving systems. <b>Anonymous</b> <b>collective</b> intelligence was then complemented by collaborative intelligence, which acknowledged identity, viewing social networks {{as the foundation for}} next generation problem-solving ecosystems, modeled on evolutionary adaptation in nature's ecosystems.|$|R

50|$|Gran Fury, {{the artistic}} {{committee}} within ACT UP, was an <b>anonymous</b> <b>collective</b> {{designed to create}} artistic media about the AIDS epidemic. The collective functioned as an anonymous group because it took emphasis away from any individual and reinforced the idea of collective efforts towards ending the crisis. Gran Fury's mission was to bring a close to the epidemic, primarily through bringing to light the issues that society grappled with, such as homophobia and discrimination of people with AIDS (PWA). The collective brought art into the public sphere often to reach wider audiences than it could reach within the museum space; additionally, because the group often faced censorship, it took to illegally posting work on the city streets.|$|R

Timed for 7 April 2013, the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day, its stated goal is to [...] "erase Israel from the internet" [...] in protest against claimed crimes committed against the Palestinian people on behalf of Israel. The event is organized and carried out by dozens of factions associated with the <b>Anonymous</b> <b>collective.</b> Websites targeted by the activists included those of banks, schools, non-profit organizations, privately owned small businesses and newspapers in Israel, as well as Israel's national Holocaust museum Yad Vashem and government agencies.|$|R

40|$|Athenian funeral orations did {{not simply}} {{celebrate}} Athenian military achievements or renew and augment a specifically <b>anonymous</b> <b>collective</b> identity and hoplite ideology. Rather, the speeches also model {{the role and}} importance of sub-groups within the democratic polis and celebrate some individual generals for their attributes and achievements as leaders. Furthermore, internal and contextual evidence shows that the prominent leaders who were chosen to deliver these speeches were often promoting or defending their own particular involvement and advocacy of the military campaign in question. This stress {{on the importance of}} the individual ‘voice’ of the orator and the speeches' inscription of exemplary individuals (probably, but by no means certainly, much more common from the 380 s downwards) offers a significant contribution to literary and historical understanding of this genre and its cultural and ideological functioning.

40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{conception}} of the typographer in the French graphic design magazine Arts et métiers graphiques, published in the interwar period. For the magazine’s editors, the designer was both an artist and a trained craftsman who was dedicated enough to face the particular challenges posed by typography. Moreover, the fruit of his work merited legal protection through copyrights. All of this points to a conception of the designer as a self-determined individual with a particular style. This view may be typical of the French conception of modern typography in that period. It is one that stands {{in contrast to the}} logic of often <b>anonymous,</b> <b>collective</b> design propagated in the New Typography of the Central-European avant-gardes. Moreover, in addition to individual creative endeavours, the French conception favoured a design practice that reconciled innovation and tradition, and artistry and craftsmanship. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Angela McRobbie {{argues that}} post-feminism’s “new sexual contract” grants {{otherwise}} privileged white women the things traditionally denied {{women as a}} class, namely, economic success and self-ownership of their bodies as sexual property (McRobbie 2004). Because voice is commonly used {{as a metaphor for}} self-possessed agency, this article considers three ways white women and femme musicians across EDMC use vocal and authorial voices to reimagine post-feminist practices of self-ownership and property-in-person. Brooklyn band bottoms, Berlin techno collective Decon/Recon and Australian-American pop star Sia, all use voice to craft femininities that deviate from post-feminist gender norms and its “new sexual contract”: bottoms perform femininity as self-dispossession, Decon/Recon’s <b>anonymous</b> <b>collective</b> authorship centers women and femmes while de-centering private property, and Sia disconnects her voice from her person so that her performances of sonic resilience (James 2015) don’t labor upon her body and turn it into private property...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} how identification, according to Kenneth Burke's theory, {{can be observed in}} the media-related practices promoted by the cyber-activist <b>collective</b> <b>Anonymous.</b> Identification is the capacity of community-building through the use of shared interests. Burke affirms that, as human beings are essentially social, identification is the very aim of any human interaction. Cyber-activism deeply relies on this capacity to promote and legitimise its campaigns. In the case of <b>Anonymous,</b> the <b>collective</b> became extremely popular and is now a frequent presence even in street protests, usually organised online, around the world. Here, I argue that this power was possible through the use of identification, which helped attract a large number of individuals to the <b>collective.</b> <b>Anonymous</b> was particularly skilled in its capacity to create an ideology for each campaign, which worked well to set up a perfect enemy who should be fought against by any people, despite their demographic or social status. Other forms of identification were also present and important. Although it is impossible to measure how many people or what kind of people Anonymous has been attracting, the presence of identification as a strong phenomenon is undeniable, since the collective {{is now one of the}} most famous cyber-activist organisations...|$|R
50|$|The songs used in Pump It Up {{are mostly}} Korean-based. Premiere 3 and Exceed {{were the only}} {{versions}} to put {{a greater emphasis on}} international pop music due to its branching into other markets such as North and Latin America. After Exceed, the focus shifted back to K-pop as the players worldwide generally favored the game's original Korean music. Much of the music on Pump is contributed by an in-house (and mostly <b>anonymous)</b> <b>collective</b> known as BanYa. Two of the main members, Yahpp and Msgoon, recently became independent artists (and as of NX and Fiesta respectively, all of their songs are now branded using their aliases). Aside from the K-pop licenses, most in-house songs on Pump it Up are of Korean influence. The diversity in genres is very great despite this, covering everything from general pop to heavy metal to Hip hop as well as an assortment of uncommon genres such as jazz, folk, and ska. Some of BanYa's songs include covers of classical pieces such as Canon in D, mostly performed in a symphonic rock style.|$|R
