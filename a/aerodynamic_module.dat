40|$|To {{improve the}} {{prediction}} of lee-side aerodynamics/aerothermodynamics for TPS/RLV structural design and optimization, a POD/RSM-based s/hypersonic <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>module</b> is developed from the high-level CFD solutions for the selected X- 34 configuration. After {{the creation of an}} extensive CFD solution database for X- 34, the "snapshot" approach of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) technique is applied to facilitate reduced-order modeling of steady state super- and hyper-sonic aerothermodynamics by varying either the angle of attack or free-stream Mach number. The scalar coefficients are further determined by the Response Surface Method (RSM) combined with Neural Networks (NN). For all Mach numbers under consideration, the first three POD modes suffice for a reasonably accurate reconstruction of the CFD solution over the entire range of angles of attack, suggesting a continuous variation of solution in the design space. The resulting s/hypersonic <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>module</b> is not only computationally more efficient than the low-level engineering methods but also as accurate as the high-level CFD methods. Such an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>module</b> is best suited for multidisciplinary design and optimization. Copyright © 2005 by ZONA Technology, Inc...|$|E

The upper-level control module achieves the maximum power point tracking and gives the reactive power signal to DFIG. The rotor-side converter transfers the upper-lever signal into an exciting voltage signal through the power and current dual closed-loop control, by which the active and reactive powers of DFIG could be decoupled.|$|E

40|$|Aircraft {{conceptual}} design often focuses on unconventional configurations like for example forward swept wings. Assessing {{the characteristics of}} these configurations usually {{requires the use of}} physic based analysis modules. This {{is due to the fact}} that for unconventional configurations no sucient database for historic based analysis modules is available. Nevertheless, physic based models require a lot of input data and their computational cost can be high. Generating input values in a trade study manually is work-intensive and error-prone. Conceptual design modules can be used to generate sucient input data for physic based models and their results can be re-integrated into the {{conceptual design}} phase. In this study a direct link between a conceptual design <b>module</b> and an <b>aerodynamic</b> design <b>module</b> is presented.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{based on}} MATLAB combined with ANSYS is presented and utilized for the aerodynamic and structural integrated optimization design of Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) blades. Three modules {{are used for}} this purpose: an <b>aerodynamic</b> analysis <b>module</b> using the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory, a structural analysis module employing the Finite Element Method (FEM) and a multi-objective optimization module utilizing the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. The former two provide a sufficiently accurate solution of the aerodynamic and structural performances of the blade; the latter handles the design variables of the optimization problem, namely, the main geometrical shape and structural parameters of the blade, and promotes function optimization. The scope of the procedure is to achieve the best trade-off performances between the maximum Annual Energy Production (AEP) and the minimum blade mass under various design requirements. To prove the efficiency and reliability of the procedure, a commercial 1. 5 megawatt (MW) HAWT blade {{is used as a}} case study.

40|$|Supercritical CO 2 (sCO 2) is {{considered}} as a working fluid in future Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) applications {{to increase the efficiency}} of the power cycle. Due to the limited experience, the turbine of an sCO 2 power cycle is in literature referred to as the component with the highest risk. In this thesis, a design methodology will be established and used to gain knowledge in sCO 2 turbine design by designing and analysing a turbine concept which can be used to generate sCO 2 turbine experimental data for validation purposes. The high density of the fluid in combination with the low power output of the turbine results in small turbine dimensions, a high rotational speed and a large axial load when using existing design wisdom. Therefore, the effect of limiting the rotational speed and axial load on the turbine design is evaluated. The turbine design methodology includes a preliminary design <b>module,</b> an <b>aerodynamic</b> design <b>module</b> and a mechanical design <b>module.</b> The <b>aerodynamic</b> design <b>module</b> consists of a steady-state and transient solver to evaluate the importance of taking into account transient effects when estimating the aerodynamic performance. According to literature, pressure loads can {{have a significant effect on}} the stresses in sCO 2 turbines. Therefore, the mechanical design module is able to take into account the pressure loading from the steady-state and transient aerodynamic design. The low power in combination with the limited rotational speed pushes the turbine design away from the desired specific speed range. During the preliminary design, the radial inflow turbine was found to give the best performance while meeting the turbine requirements. The degree of reaction of the turbine is close to 0, to limit the axial load due to the pressure difference across the rotor. As a result of the low specific speed, the turbine efficiency of 74 % is lower than usually seen for radial inflow turbines. As no sudden peaks in entropy generation are seen across the rotor channel, it can be concluded that the high curvature of a low reaction radial inflow turbine does not seem to have a detrimental effect on the turbine performance. The main contribution to the losses can be found in the rotor channel as a result of the tip clearance losses and high flow velocities compared to reference turbines, while the stator losses are comparable. A good agreement is found between the steady-state and transient aerodynamic analysis. Based on this, it can be concluded that a steady-state analysis can give a good approximation of the turbine performance, but evaluating more designs would be required to generalise this statement to all small-scale low reaction sCO 2 turbomachinery. Due to the low degree of reaction of the turbine, the stresses originating from the pressure load are found to be less than 1 % of the total stresses. Based on this, it can be concluded that only taking into account centrifugal loads for a low reaction sCO 2 turbine gives a good estimation of the stresses in the turbine during operation. As this research focuses to a large extend on establishing the methodology, for future research it is recommended to perform a more thorough optimisation of the turbine shape, in particular to reduce the losses in the rotor channel by for example introducing a shrouded design. Moreover, it is recommended to analyse the turbine in combination with the other subsystems in the power block to also take into account the interaction between the subsystems...|$|R
40|$|Flutter {{analysis}} of a wing is performed in compressible flow using state-space representation of the unsteady aerodynamic behavior. Three different expressions are used to incorporate corrections due to the finite-span effects of the wing in estimating the lift-curve slope. The structural formulation {{is based on a}} Rayleigh-Pitz technique with Chebyshev polynomials used for the wing deflections. The aeroelastic equations are solved as an eigen-value problem to determine the flutter speed of the wing. The flutter speeds are found to be higher in these cases, when compared to that obtained without accounting for the finite-span effects. The derivatives of the flutter speed with respect to the shape parameters, namely: aspect ratio, area, taper ratio and sweep angle, are calculated analytically. The shape sensitivity derivatives give a linear approximation to the flutter speed curves over a range of values of the shape parameter which is perturbed. Flutter and sensitivity calculations are performed on a wing using a lifting-surface unsteady <b>aerodynamic</b> theory using <b>modules</b> from a system of programs called FAST...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the robust {{aerodynamic}} design of the bladed rotor of small horizontal axis wind turbines. The optimization process also considers the effects of manufacturing and assembly tolerances on the yearly energy production. The aerodynamic performance of the rotors so designed has reduced sensitivity to manufacturing and assembly errors. The geometric uncertainty affecting the rotor shape is represented by normal distributions of the pitch angle of the blades, and the twist angle and chord of their airfoils. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>module</b> is a blade element momentum theory code. Both Monte Carlo-based and the Univariate ReducedQuadrature technique, a novel deterministic uncertainty propagationmethod, are used. The performance of the two approaches is assessed both interms of accuracy and computational speed. The adopted optimization method {{is based on a}} hybrid multi-objective evolutionary strategy. The presented results highlight that the sensitivity of the yearly production to geometric uncertainties can be reduced by reducing the rotational speed and increasing the aerodynamic blade loads...|$|E
40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{control of}} {{wind turbine blades}} employing active flow controllers {{is part of an}} ongoing research effort aiming to alleviate blade loads. Over the past years, the growing body of literature has confirmed the preliminary potential of active flow controllers and, in particular, of control surfaces in relieving wind turbine fatigue and extreme loads. The aim of present research is to investigate the feasibility, design and capability of a multi-component aero-structural load control system utilising light control surfaces such as trailing edge flaps and microtabs. This is achieved through the design of load alleviation control systems, and a detailed understanding of the aeroelastic dynamic of wind turbine blades equipped with control surfaces. As part of this research, a Wind Turbine Aeroelastic Control (WTAC) simulator has been developed. WTAC is the combination of an unsteady <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>module,</b> a structural finite element analysis module, and a control module incorporating the aerodynamic models of control surfaces.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the performance of different controllers in active load control of wind turbine blades equipped with microtabs. A bang–bang (BB) controller, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) a proportional integral derivative (PID) and a sliding mode controller (SMC) are synthesised for load alleviation. The performance of the synthesised controllers in load alleviation is evaluated by employing WTAC (Wind Turbine Aeroelastic and Control), a wind turbine simulator incorporating an unsteady <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>module,</b> a structural analysis module and a control module. The variable-speed pitch-controlled NREL- 5 MW is adopted as the case study. Using frequency domain analysis it is shown that for the studied case all controllers have {{more or less the same}} performance at rejecting the first rotational frequency loads. It is also shown that all controllers are more effective at rejecting loads with lower frequencies. BB and PID controllers, although capable of rejecting low frequency loads, may cause amplification of loads with higher frequencies. Investigating the performance of four controllers at different wind speeds for the studied wind turbine, it is observed that the effectiveness of BB and PID controllers reduces with wind speed but on the other hand SMC and LQR perform better at higher wind speeds. Introducing a new parameter, life index, the performance of different controllers in terms of the actuation wear is investigated. It is shown that LQR cause less actuation wear compared to SMC, while having comparable performance in load alleviation...|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} platform {{has been}} developed which features a geometric, a grid generation and an <b>aerodynamic</b> analysis <b>module.</b> The main intent is to execute a quick though reliable preliminary aerodynamic analysis on a generic complex aerodynamic configuration and, at the same time, provide a mean of exporting the defined geometry or grid to leading CAE/CAD, meshing and analysis softwares, for deep detail modifications or more accurate, although time consuming, analysis. In the geometric module, the process of shape definition is easily and intuitively achieved {{with the aid of}} specific features and tools. The geometric description relies on NURBS, a flexible, accurate and efficient parametric form. Once the configuration has been defined, the user is ready to move on the grid generation module, or to export it to IGES standard format in order to use CAE/CAD, meshing or aerodynamic analysis programs. The grid generation module is capable to build structured or unstructured meshes. Both of the processes are automatized, even if the user can easily set and control grid parameters. The structured grid generator is oriented to LaWGS description standard, while the unstructured grid can be exported to different formats. The user is now ready to launch Pan Air, a panel method, as the aerodynamic solver. The preprocessor and postprocessor aid to the definition of the flow parameters and to the graphical visualization of the results. One of the strength of this code is the user friendly GUI organization of each module: the user is aided throughout all the steps. Besides this, every module relies on fast computational algorithms to speed up the overall process. For all these reasons, this code has a natural lean to be used in pair with an optimization tool...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was motivated by}} the need to perform an accurate aerodynamic analysis of the drag deorbit device concept under development within the Space Research Centre, Cranfield University. Its purpose is to deorbit satellites from low Earth orbit {{at the end of the}} useful lives, in order to help reduce the growing problem of space debris. It has been found that existing spacecraft aerodynamic analysis tools do not adequately support concurrent engineering. Furthermore, use of concurrent engineering in the space industry is currently limited to Phase A (preliminary design studies). To remedy this, the Spacecraft Engineering, Design, and Analysis Tools (SEDAT) Concept has been proposed. Inspired by the approach employed by enterprise applications, it proposes that all the computer tools used on a spacecraft project should be incorporated into one system as separate modules, presented via a single client, and connected to a centralised Relational Database Management System. To demonstrate the concept and assess its potential a SEDAT System and accompanying Free Molecular Flow (FMF) spacecraft <b>aerodynamic</b> analysis <b>module</b> have been developed. The FMF Module is explicitly designed to facilitate concurrent engineering and make use of the maximum variety of Gas-Surface Interaction Models (GSIMs) and their associated data. It also incorporates a new Hybrid method of FMF analysis that combines the Ray-Tracing Panel (RTP) and Test-Particle Monte Carlo (TPMC) methods, enabling it to analyse complex geometries that are subject to surface shielding and multiple molecular reflections. Studies have been performed using a Hybrid version of the Schaaf and Chambre GSIM. One of these studies analysed a drag deorbit device design using a range of accommodation coefficients, including the latest empirically based incidence-dependent coefficients.

40|$|Aero-structural {{optimization}} of {{gas turbine}} blades {{is a very}} challenging task, given e. g. three dimensional nature of the flow, stringent performance requirements, structural and manufacturing considerations, etc. The current research work addresses this challenge by {{development and implementation of}} structural shape optimization module and integrating it with an <b>aerodynamic</b> shape optimization <b>module</b> to form an automated aero-structural optimization procedure. The optimizer combines a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), with a Response Surface Approximation (RSA) of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) type. During the optimization process, each objective function and constraint is approximated by an individual ANN, which is trained and tested using an aerodynamic as well as a structure database composed of a few high fidelity flow simulations (CFD) and structure analysis (CSD) that are obtained using ANSYS Workbench 11. 0. Addition of this multiple ANN technique to the optimizer greatly improves the accuracy of the RSA, provides control over handling different design variables and disciplines.

40|$|Presented is {{a robust}} {{optimization}} {{strategy for the}} aerodynamic design of {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} rotors including the variability of the annual energy production because of the uncertainty of the blade geometry caused by manufacturing and assembly errors. The energy production of a rotor designed with the proposed robust optimization approach features lower sensitivity to stochastic geometry errors with respect to that of a rotor designed with the conventional deterministic optimization approach that ignores these errors. The geometry uncertainty is represented by normal distributions of the blade pitch angle, and the twist angle and chord of the airfoils. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>module</b> is a blade-element momentum theory code. Both Monte Carlo sampling and the univariate reduced quadrature technique, a novel deterministic uncertainty analysis method, are used for uncertainty propagation. The performance of the two approaches is assessed in terms of accuracy and computational speed. A two-stage multi-objective evolution-based optimization strategy is used. Results highlight that, for the considered turbine type, the sensitivity of the annual energy production to rotor geometry errors can be reduced by reducing the rotational speed and increasing the blade loading. The primary objective of the paper is to highlight how to incorporate an efficient and accurate uncertainty propagation strategy in wind turbine design. The formulation of the considered design problem does not include all the engineering constraints adopted in real turbine design, but the proposed probabilistic design strategy is fairly independent of the problem definition and can be easily extended to turbine design systems of any complexity...|$|E
40|$|Aeroservoelasticity (ASE) is the {{interdisciplinary}} {{study of the}} interaction of structural, inertial, aerodynamic, and control loads for aircraft systems, and is inherently a nonlinear phenomenon. One {{of the goals of}} ASE research is to provide active gust load alleviation in aircraft to improve ride quality, minimize airframe fatigue, and increase performance. The goal of this research is to develop a robust aeroelastic (AE) predictive model for a wing section that represents a typical flexible wing in flight, and which will be used as a platform for developing ASE controllers. The various components of this research, including an unsteady <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>module,</b> a structural module, and a gust module, have been individually developed and validated with experiments. The experimental facility, comprising of a pitch-plunge free vibration apparatus, a real-time gust sniffing sensor, and an oscillating vane gust generator, are designed and developed at Texas A&M as test beds for current and future ASE research. Both the experiments and predictive model are used to explore nonlinear behavior of the system response. For example, the research has led to experimentally derived bifurcation diagrams depicting possible responses. The limit cycle oscillations (LCO) observed in experiments are captured by the predictive model. The AE model allows for parametric study of wing response on various system features such as nonlinear structural stiffness, nonlinear Coulomb damping, mass imbalance, and other design features. Also, the response of a wing under oncoming gusts is examined. This AE predictive model will serve as a platform to develop ASE models and controllers in future, and the experimental facility will serve as a test bed for validation of developed controllers...|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{potential}} wind farm sites in deeper waters and further offshore has substantially increased recently, and in parallel an increased interest towards floating, rather than bottom-fixed, offshore wind turbines: the Energy Technologies Institute (UK) recently announced {{a plan to}} invest £ 25 m in offshore floating wind turbine projects. Furthermore, a recent document by the UK LCICG (Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group), demonstrated that the “Development and demonstration of new concepts such as floating foundations for water depths > 60 m”, has a value in meeting emissions targets at low cost of up to £ 13 bn. The present article is a follow on with the previous article presented at OMAE 2013 [1], in which the progresses {{on the development of}} an aero-hydro-servo-elastic coupled model of dynamics for VAWT are illustrated, called FloVAWT. The further progresses presented consist in: a) the model, in particular the hydrodynamic module, has been now validated against experimental data provided by the DeepCwind project (see OC 4) for the semi-submersible support structure configuration, b) the additional velocity component due to the 6 degree-of-freedom motion of the supporting floating structure are now taken into account within the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>module,</b> while previously only the displacement imposed by the support structure was considered, c) a new module dedicated to the mooring system has been developed and validated, capable of modelling catenary mooring systems with a quasi-static, energy-based approach.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} aerodynamic methodology {{has been}} loosely coupled to a geometrically exact beam structural analysis {{to study the}} static aeroelastic behavior of a high-aspect-ratio wing. The aim of the present effort {{was to investigate the}} effects of adding aerodynamic nonlinearity on the elastic behavior, in particular identifying the areas of nonlinearities and their importance. Care was taken to evaluate the Euler solver and the transfer of data between the <b>aerodynamic</b> and structural <b>modules</b> to identify sources of numerical error that may contribute to incorrect modeling of large deflections. It was found that sensitivities near the wing tip and leading edge required additional attention when clustering the computational aerodynamic grid near the surface. Further, the transfer of loads from the Euler code to the structural code requires that the nonlinear drop of forces and moments be modeled as exactly as possible. Otherwise errors in the predicted geometric deformations of up to 10 % can occur. These are exacerbated for cases with large deflections and twist. For loosely coupled static aeroelastic simulations, the nonlinear aerodynamic predictions provided by the solution of the Euler equations are lower than the predictions of the vortex panel code. This results in lower predicted bending and twist by the higher-order aerodynamic code, indicating that the divergence and possibly flutter speeds predicted by lower-order aerodynamics may be overly conservative...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, several {{ideas to}} apply {{electromagnetic}} launch technology to spaceflight applications have come up. The use of electric energy to propel a payload carrier promises savings of propellant and, therefore, cost reduction {{for the transfer}} to orbit. Previous studies mostly comprised a rough estimation of the launcher and the vehicle size. Sometimes, a Dv-budget is given to illustrate the energy expenditure. Some studies neglect {{the necessity of a}} rocket engine. Only by means of an electromagnetic launch, without the capability to maneuver reaching an orbit is not achievable. In addition to a propulsion system, an attitude control system and a flight controller are needed to bring the vehicle into a circular orbit. The high acceleration and high velocities at low altitudes have set high demands on the payload-carrying vehicle. Its structure has to withstand the high acceleration forces during launch and the tremendous aerodynamic heat fluxes during ascent through the dense atmosphere. This paper presents a vehicle concept that addresses all these demands. The vehicle consists of a two-stage hybrid rocket engine system, a thermal protection system (TPS), and high-test peroxide monopropellant thrusters for an attitude control system and a guidance, navigation, and control system. A simulation model is created, which consists of a 6 -DOF flight mechanics module, an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>module,</b> propulsion module, TPS simulation, as well as a guidance and flight control simulation. Therefore, the complete ascent with all its aspects can be simulated.
