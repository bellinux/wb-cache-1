5|$|According to {{continuation}} Bond author Raymond Benson, {{there was}} {{further development of}} the Bond character in Thunderball, with glimpses of both his sense of humour <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> sense of mortality being shown. Felix Leiter had his largest role to date in a Bond story and much of his humour came though, whilst his incapacity, suffered in Live and Let Die, had not led to bitterness or to his being unable to join in with the underwater fight scene {{towards the end of}} the novel.|$|E

5|$|Because {{no money}} is {{exchanged}} and laws are rarely broken, {{there is little}} legal recourse to take upon discovery of someone faking illness. However, a participant in a 7,000-member online support group brought a lawsuit against a website for defamatory language in 2005. The lawsuit followed heated discussion on the website about his dire predicaments and related crises, which seemed to contradict medical knowledge <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> accounts. The lawsuit was withdrawn after the presiding judge intended to allow cross-examination of the plaintiff's medical history.|$|E
5|$|Brock felt {{he needed}} to go further. He was {{hampered}} by Governor General George Prevost, who had replaced Craig in late 1811. Prevost's orders from the government, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> inclinations, were to emphasise defence. Prevost kept {{the bulk of his}} forces in Lower Canada to protect Quebec, and opposed any attack into United States. Brock also believed that he was handicapped by inertia and defeatism among the Legislature and other officials.|$|E

5|$|During his reign, Michael {{relied heavily}} on the loyalty and support {{of a group of}} Oltenian lords, the most {{important}} of whom were Buzescu Brothers (Romanian: Fraţii Buzeşti) <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> relatives on his mother's side, the Cantacuzinos. He consequently protected their interests throughout his reign; for example, he passed a law binding serfs to lands owned by aristocrats. From the standpoint of religious jurisdiction, the Treaty of Alba Iulia had another important consequence: it placed all the Eastern Orthodox bishops in Transylvania {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Metropolitan Seat of Târgovişte.|$|E

5|$|In {{creating}} the game, Rohrer {{was influenced by}} his childhood fear of his house being robbed, numerous publicized shootings, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> political views regarding gun rights and home invasions.

It received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the design and creativity and others finding it hard to empathize with the game's intended message.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, as he {{was writing}} Parts II and IV, Joyce's {{progress}} slowed considerably.

5|$|It {{is written}} in the same style as the Tory {{publications}} that attacked Dissenters, and was assumed by some people to be a genuine vindication of their view. The pamphlet raised embarrassing questions about {{the handling of the}} issue by the Tory ministry, and led to Defoe's arrest for seditious libel. His imprisonment, during which he fell into bankruptcy, was to have a lasting influence on his subsequent writings. In the years after his release, Defoe published several pamphlets that attempted to explain its purpose <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> views.|$|E
