5|$|Duquesne {{was unable}} to extend its streak on the road against St. Louis, as they lost 59–69. Bill Clark led the team with 17points and Saunders grabbed four steals, enough to raise his per-game average to 2.9, a nation-leading figure. With this, Saunders had at one point {{led the nation in}} double-doubles, rebounds, and steals. The Dukes lost again, 80–92, in their final road game against Saint Bonaventure. The loss put <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> <b>on</b> Duquesne's hopes for a home game {{in the first round of}} the Atlantic 10 tournament, as they fell into a tie for the ninth seed position.|$|E
5|$|News of {{the battle}} was {{received}} in England shortly after news {{of the fall of}} Louisbourg, putting <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> <b>on</b> the celebrations marking that victory. The full scope of British victories in 1758 did not reach English shores until later in the year, when Pitt learned of the successes at Forts Duquesne and Frontenac, key steps in completing the conquest of New France. Had Carillon also fallen in 1758, the conquest might have been completed in 1758 or 1759; as it happened, Montreal (the last point of resistance) did not surrender until 1760, with campaigns launched from Fort Oswego, Quebec, and Carillon, which was captured and renamed Ticonderoga in 1759 by forces under the command of Jeffrey Amherst, the victor at Louisbourg.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1873 put <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> <b>on</b> this growth, and in {{the interim}} the city's steel {{industry}} began to decline, squeezed by competition from newer, more efficient producers in Western Pennsylvania and the Midwest {{on one side and}} labor unrest at home. But the textile industry remained strong, and even grew. Accordingly, its residents continued to embrace new movements in architecture. The 1880 pharmacy building at 137 Second Street featured a highly decorated cast iron storefront and curved windows showing the influence of the Queen Anne Style. Further down Second Street, industrialist Jonas Heartt's house built that same year {{is one of the best}} residential applications of the same style.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} Operation Momentum brought about more {{extensive}} {{training for the}} Hmong and other hill tribes recruits such as the Lao Theung. Further training of Special Operating Teams of ADC graduates was begun in August 1961, {{with the aim of}} gradually replacing foreign trainers with Lao instructors. In July 1962, the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos put <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> <b>on</b> Momentum operations until the following April. During this lull, Colonel (later Major General) Vang Pao gathered five ADC companies into a battalion-sized Special Guerrilla Unit.

25|$|The Cold War, {{especially}} in the 1950s and 1960s, put <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> <b>on</b> the Esperanto movement as well, as there were fears on both sides that Esperanto {{could be used for}} enemy propaganda. However, the language experienced something of a renaissance in the 1970s and spread to new parts of the world, such as its veritable explosion in popularity in Iran in 1975. By 1991 there were enough African Esperantists to warrant a pan-African congress. The language continues to spread, although it is not officially recognised by any country, and is part of the state educational curriculum of only a few.|$|E
25|$|Although mining had {{provided}} foreign exchange, {{the vast majority}} of Hondurans gained their livelihoods from agriculture, usually on a subsistence level. Periodic efforts were made to develop agricultural exports, but they met with little success. Some tobacco, cattle, and hides were exported, mostly to neighboring countries. The recurring civil conflicts and the resultant confiscation of stock by various military commanders, however, put <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> <b>on</b> efforts to develop the cattle industry and contributed to its rather backward status. Some bananas and other fruits were exported from the Islas de la Bahía, much of this trade going to New Orleans, but the volume was small and the benefit {{for the rest of the}} nation almost imperceptible.|$|E
25|$|The {{neutrality}} of the United States {{was tested}} during the Napoleonic Wars. After the Chesapeake–Leopard affair, President Thomas Jefferson {{was faced with}} a decision to make regarding the situation at hand. In the end, he chose an economic option: the Embargo Act of 1807. Jefferson essentially closed all the ports overnight, putting <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> <b>on</b> the seaport town of Salem. The embargo of 1807 was the starting point on the path to the War of 1812 with Great Britain. Both Great Britain and France imposed trade restrictions in order to weaken each other's economies. This also had the effect of disrupting American trade and testing the United States' neutrality. As time went on, harassment of American ships by the British Navy increased. This included impressment and seizures of American men and goods.|$|E

Both the transient and steady-state behaviors are analyzed, and the attitude errors relative to a fixed star are established.

500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend focused {{primarily}} on the series finale in her review but referred to this episode as containing a solid case-of-the-week. “Overall {{it was a good}} mystery-of-the-week but seeing as it was the second to last episode, the only thing I cared about was that we finally got more Weevil!” Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review, stating that the case-of-the-week was an oversimplification of the overall themes of Veronica Mars. The reviewer enjoyed the potential for Logan and Dick’s character development, although he felt that it was blunted by the knowledge that the series was about to end. “As fun as this episode is, the lack of the fourth season stops me from fully enjoying it. [...] But the knowledge that this might be the last time we see them puts <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> <b>on</b> things. Still, better to go out with good episodes than bad.” ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1967—after the album was completed—Evans flew with McCartney to Los Angeles to see McCartney's then-girlfriend, Jane Asher, who was acting there with the Old Vic theatre company. The three of them went {{on a trip to}} the Rockies, {{returning}} to LA in Frank Sinatra's jet. Evans: [...] "We left Denver in Frank Sinatra's Lear Jet, which he very kindly loaned us. A beautiful job with dark black leather upholstery and, to our delight, a well-stocked bar." [...] When they were back in LA, they were invited to visit the house of Michelle and John Phillips, from the Mamas & the Papas. Brian Wilson was also there, as he was working on the Beach Boys Smile album. Evans wrote about singing [...] "On Top of Old Smokey" [...] with McCartney and Wilson, but was not impressed by Wilson's avant-garde attitude to music: [...] "Brian [...] then put <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> <b>on</b> the spontaneity of the whole affair by walking in with a tray of water-filled glasses, trying to arrange it into some sort of session." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{director}} Mike Nichols, then filming The Graduate, {{had become}} {{fascinated with the}} duo's past two efforts, listening to them nonstop before and after filming. After two weeks of this obsession, he met with Clive Davis to ask for permission to license Simon & Garfunkel music for his film. Davis viewed it as a perfect fit and envisioned a best-selling soundtrack album. Simon was not as immediately receptive, viewing movies akin to [...] "selling out", creating <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> <b>on</b> his artistic integrity. However, after meeting Nichols and becoming impressed by his wit and the script, he agreed to write at least one or two new songs for the film. Leonard Hirshan, a powerful agent at William Morris, negotiated a deal that paid Simon $25,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) to submit three songs to Nichols and producer Lawrence Turman. Several weeks later, Simon re-emerged with two new tracks, [...] "Punky's Dilemma" [...] and [...] "Overs", neither of which Nichols was particularly taken with. The duo offered another new song, which later became [...] "Mrs. Robinson", that was not as developed. Nichols loved it.|$|E
