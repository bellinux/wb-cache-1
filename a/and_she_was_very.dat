5|$|In {{an early}} draft {{of what would}} later become Shakugan no Shana, Yashichiro Takahashi set the story in a {{different}} dimension and described the main character as having the initial personality of Shana, but the appearance of an older woman similar to Margery Daw. However, after talking with an editor, Takahashi rewrote the character to have the appearance of a young girl. In doing so, he used Shana's small build to symbolize a story of growth and to emphasize the physical conflict between her and her opponents. Noizi Ito was contacted in early August 2002 to be the illustrator for the series, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> excited to work on the project after she read the manuscript for the first novel; {{this was the first time}} Ito drew illustrations for a book.|$|E
25|$|The Resurrection Stone {{allows the}} holder {{to bring back}} {{deceased}} loved ones, in a semi-physical form, and communicate with them. The form of Sirius Black generated by the stone tells Harry {{that he and the}} other forms created by the stone are part of him and invisible to others. This seems to suggest that these apparitions are conjured from memories and are not really resurrected people. According to the fairy tale concerning the origin of the Deathly Hallows, using the Resurrection Stone drove the owner to kill himself because he brought his late fiancée back from the dead, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> unhappy in the real world for she did not belong there. By the time the stone was seen in Marvolo Gaunt's possession, it had been set into a ring that bore the symbol of the Deathly Hallows, which the ignorant Gaunt believed to be the Peverell coat of arms; he used the ring to boast about his ancestry and blood purity. Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald desired the stone, but for different reasons. While Dumbledore wanted it to communicate with his dead family, Grindelwald allegedly intended to use it to create an army of zombie-like Inferi. Harry said this is the Hallow he would desire most, as like Dumbledore he could name people he would like to communicate with again. Voldemort became aware of the ring's antiquity and eventually used the stone as a Horcrux, a container for part of his soul, being unaware of its additional magical properties.|$|E
500|$|Manning {{supplemented}} {{her book}} writing by reviewing for The Spectator, The Sunday Times, The Observer, Punch and others, {{as well as}} making occasional contributions to the Palestine Post. Her fourth novel, A Different Face, was published in 1953. Set in a drab city based on Manning's hometown of Portsmouth, it chronicled the main character's attempts to leave his birthplace. The book was not well-reviewed, and as was frequently the case, Manning felt slighted, feeling {{that she did not}} get the reviews she deserved. Neurotic self-doubt and perfectionism made her difficult and easily offended, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> aware of younger writers outstripping her. Such an author was Iris Murdoch, with whom Manning shared an interest in flying saucers and an uneasy friendship that was tinged with jealousy at the younger Murdoch's greater success. Manning knew that she was spiteful, but could not help herself, frequently critiquing writer friends to others. However, she consistently praised and admired Ivy Compton-Burnett to whom she had been introduced in 1945, and whose friendship she greatly valued. She complained about her publisher Heinemann and her lack of recognition from her peers: Anthony Powell called her [...] "the world's worst grumbler", and the publisher remembered that she was [...] "never an easy author to handle." [...] A friend gave her the nickname [...] "Olivia Moaning", which was picked up by others, much to Manning's annoyance.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] was {{directed}} by the American photographer Herb Ritts, and shot at Key Biscayne in Miami, Florida {{in the last week}} of January 2001. Spears revealed she was inspired by Janet Jackson's video for [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)"(1990) to select Ritts as the video's director. According to Ritts, the singer [...] "wanted to do something fresh. There was one outfit, no dancing, and that meant that it boiled down to her. She really had to act the song, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> impressive." [...] He also revealed that the video was set at [...] "a funky beach shack" [...] similar to the videos for Madonna's [...] "Cherish" [...] (1989) and Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game" [...] (1989). [...] "The story is, pretty much, Britney longing for him to tell her the words", said Ritts, who was impressed with the chemistry between the singer and her fictional boyfriend, played by French model Brice Durand. Spears' real-life boyfriend at the time Justin Timberlake, however, [...] "was said to be miffed at Spears' kissing scenes with French model," [...] according to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV. Spears mother, Lynne, also criticized considered the original music video for being too racy at the time, because it contained sexually explicit material. Parts of the video were edited before its release to the public.|$|E
2500|$|Patty Duke, Barbara Parkins, and Judy Garland {{were cast}} as the other leads. Susan Hayward {{replaced}} Garland {{a few weeks later}} when she was dismissed. Director Mark Robson was highly critical of the three principal actresses, but according to Duke, directed most of his criticism at Tate. Duke later said Robson [...] "continually treated [...] like an imbecile, which she definitely was not, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> attuned and sensitive to this treatment". Polanski later quoted Robson as saying to him, [...] "That's a great girl you're living with. Few actresses have her kind of vulnerability. She's got a great future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Evans left Dynasty in 1989, {{four months}} before the series came to an end, after only {{appearing}} in six episodes of the 22-episode season. After leaving Dynasty, Evans semi-retired from acting and made only occasional television appearances. Instead, she devoted her time to fitness issues {{and set up a}} small chain of fitness centers. In the 1990s, Evans hosted infomercials for Rejuvenique, a mask for toning facial muscles. She had previously written the Linda Evans Beauty and Exercise book in 1983. She also kept in touch with Forsythe, until he died on April 1, 2010, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> devastated by his passing. Evans was asked when she first met Forsythe, as an unfamiliar actress, for her first speaking part, with him: Her agent [...] "signed me up for 'Bachelor Father' and John Forsythe gave me my first speaking part." ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{returned}} to North Dakota for a tonsillectomy and was noticed by hotel owner Frank Bering {{while working at}} the Doll House in Palm Springs, California. It was here that she developed her trademark sultry purr – having decided {{to compete with the}} noisy crowd with subtlety rather than volume. Beringin offered her a gig at The Buttery Room, a nightclub in the Ambassador Hotel East in Chicago. There, she was noticed by bandleader Benny Goodman. According to Lee, [...] "Benny's then-fiancée, Lady Alice Duckworth, came into The Buttery, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> impressed. So the next evening she brought Benny in, because {{they were looking for a}} replacement for Helen Forrest. And although I didn't know, I was it. He was looking at me strangely, I thought, but it was just his preoccupied way of looking. I thought that he didn't like me at first, but it just was that he was preoccupied with what he was hearing." [...] She joined his band in 1941 and stayed for two years.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the High School Musical series, Hudgens confirmed that she was taking a break from her music career to focus more on acting. She played a supporting role in a musical comedy Bandslam, which was released theatrically on August14, 2009. Hudgens plays [...] "Sa5m", a 15-year-old awkward freshman with untapped talents. Although Bandslam was commercially unsuccessful, Hudgens's performance received praise from critics. David Waddington of the North Wales Pioneer noted that Hudgens [...] "outshines the rest of the cast, failing to fit in with the outcast narrative and making the inevitable climactic ending all the more expected", and Philip French of The Guardian compared her acting to Thandie Newton and Dorothy Parker. Hudgens made a return to theater productions and starred in the musical Rent as Mimi. The stage production ran from August6–8, 2010 at the Hollywood Bowl. Her involvement in the production drew negative comments, but director Neil Patrick Harris defended his decision with casting Hudgens by saying, [...] "Vanessa [...] is awesome. She's a friend. I asked her to come in and sing to make sure she had the chops for it. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> committed and seemed great." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2002, it was {{reported}} that Lucy Benjamin had quit her role of Lisa. She commented, [...] "I’ve had a wonderful five years and I’m terribly excited by the [...] storyline.” EastEnders executive producer Louise Berridge added, “This {{is going to be a}} very demanding story to play but I know Lucy will do a fabulous job. She’s an actress with a terrific future.” Despite initial claims that the actress had decided to leave, she later admitted that the producers had axed the character. Discussing Lisa's exit, Lucy Benjamin's boyfriend of the time, actor Steve McFadden who plays Phil Mitchell, said, [...] "Lucy didn’t feel comfortable with lying. There’s a stigma attached to being given the boot but she felt stupid pretending she’d decided to pack in a great job. It was hard for her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> upset but she’s come through it. I felt for her but soaps are led by storylines and Lucy was told that the writers had come up with a brilliant plot that was too good to say no to.I guess Lucy’s character was so central to the plot that eventually it blew up in her face. I’m proud of the fact that she was good enough to come to the forefront of the show. Lucy did so well to make her mark on EastEnders in the first place because Lisa arrived on the Square on her own. She wasn’t part of a family, which means she was more vulnerable to the chop. She was only on a three-month contract but she made it a success and ended up being part of the cast for four years. If you are part of a screen family on EastEnders you are practically bomb-proof, no matter what your ability is as an actor." ...|$|E
