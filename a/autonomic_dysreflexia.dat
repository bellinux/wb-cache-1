5|$|Another risk is <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> (AD), {{a medical}} {{emergency}} involving dangerously high blood pressure. People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E
5|$|Counseling {{about sex}} and {{sexuality}} by medical professionals, psychologists, social workers, and nurses {{is a part of}} most SCI rehabilitation programs. Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI, as are psychotherapy, peer mentorship, and social activities; these are helpful for improving skills needed for socializing and relationships. Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account the individual as a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships and self-esteem. Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress, and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity. Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex, or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia.</b>|$|E
5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} are sometimes collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia,</b> so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E
25|$|Pressure ulcers {{can trigger}} other ailments, cause {{considerable}} suffering, {{and can be}} expensive to treat. Some complications include <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia,</b> bladder distension, bone infection, pyarthroses, sepsis, amyloidosis, anemia, urethral fistula, gangrene and very rarely malignant transformation (Marjolin's ulcer - secondary carcinomas in chronic wounds). Sores may recur if those with pressure ulcers do not follow recommended treatment or may instead develop seromas, hematomas, infections, or wound dehiscence. Paralyzed individuals {{are the most likely}} to have pressure sores recur. In some cases, complications from pressure sores can be life-threatening. The most common causes of fatality stem from kidney failure and amyloidosis.|$|E
25|$|Sublingual {{nifedipine}} {{has previously}} been used in hypertensive emergencies. It was once frequently prescribed as needed to people taking MAOIs for real or perceived hypertensive crises. This {{was found to be}} dangerous, and has been abandoned. Sublingual nifedipine causes blood-pressure lowering through peripheral vasodilation. It can cause an uncontrollable decrease in blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, and a steal phenomenon in certain vascular beds. There have been multiple reports in the medical literature of serious adverse effects with sublingual nifedipine, including cerebral ischemia/infarction, myocardial infarction, complete heart block, and death. As a result of this, the FDA reviewed all data regarding the safety and efficacy of sublingual nifedipine for hypertensive emergencies in 1995, and concluded that the practice should be abandoned because it was neither safe nor efficacious. An exception to the avoidance of this practice is in the use of nifedipine in the treatment of hypertension associated with <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> in spinal cord injury.|$|E
500|$|For {{women with}} {{injuries}} above T6, a risk during labor and delivery that threatens {{both mother and}} fetus is <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia,</b> in which the blood pressure increases to dangerous levels high enough to cause potentially deadly stroke. Drugs such as nifedipine and captopril {{can be used to}} manage an episode if it occurs, and epidural anesthesia helps although it is not very reliable in women with SCI. [...] Anesthesia is used for labor and delivery even for women without sensation, who may only experience contractions as abdominal discomfort, increased spasticity, and episodes of <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia.</b> Reduced sensation in the pelvic area means women with SCI usually have less painful delivery; in fact, they may fail to realize when they go into labor. If there are deformities in the pelvis or spine caesarian section may be necessary. Babies of women with SCI {{are more likely to be}} born prematurely, and, premature or not, they are more likely to be small for their gestational time.|$|E
500|$|One {{condition}} that occurs typically in lesions above the T6 level is <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> (AD), {{in which the}} blood pressure increases to dangerous levels, high enough to cause potentially deadly stroke. It results from an overreaction of the system to a stimulus such as pain {{below the level of}} injury, because inhibitory signals from the brain cannot pass the lesion to dampen the excitatory sympathetic nervous system response. [...] Signs and symptoms of AD include anxiety, headache, nausea, ringing in the ears, blurred vision, flushed skin, and nasal congestion. [...] It can occur shortly after the injury or not until years later.|$|E
500|$|Urinary tract {{infection}} (UTI) {{is another}} risk {{that may not}} display the usual symptoms (pain, urgency and frequency); it may instead be associated with worsened spasticity. The risk of UTI, likely the most common complication in the long term, is heightened by use of indwelling urinary catheters. Catheterization may be necessary because SCI interferes with the bladder's ability to empty when it gets too full, which could trigger <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> or damage the bladder permanently. [...] The use of intermittent catheterization to empty the bladder at regular intervals throughout the day has decreased the mortality due to kidney failure from UTI in the first world, {{but it is still}} a serious problem in developing countries.|$|E
500|$|Athletes have cheated by over-representing {{impairment}} to have {{a competitive}} advantage, {{and the use of}} performance-enhancing drugs. [...] German skier Thomas Oelsner became the first Winter Paralympian to test positive for steroids in 2002. [...] He had won two gold medals in the alpine events but was stripped of his medals. One concern now facing Paralympic officials is the technique of boosting blood pressure, known as <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia.</b> [...] The increase in blood pressure can improve performance by 15% and is most effective in the endurance sports such as cross-country skiing. [...] To increase blood pressure athletes will deliberately cause trauma to limbs below a spinal injury. [...] This trauma can include breaking bones, strapping extremities in too tightly and using high-pressured compression stockings. [...] The injury is painless to the athlete but affects the body and impacts the athlete's blood pressure, as can techniques like allowing the bladder to overfill.|$|E
50|$|Other causes include {{medication}} {{side effects}} and various disease processes. The use of stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines which can result in urinary retention, {{and the use of}} CNS depressants and other psychoactive drugs can also lead to urinary retention and constipation thus leading to <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> when in use {{over an extended period of}} time. Guillain-Barré syndrome is a demyelinating disease that can result in peripheral paralysis and can progress to encompass autonomic functions, leading to a loss of normal respiratory, bladder and bowel function resulting in <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia.</b> Severe head trauma and other brain injuries can instigate <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> at the central nervous system by interfering with the reception of the signal that brings the urge to void the bladder and bowels and with the voluntary ability to micturate and defecate.Other causal theories for <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> include noxious stimuli, or painful stimuli arising from the peripheral sensory neurons. These stimuli are interrupted in their journey to the brain due to a transection of the spine result in a paradoxical stimulation of autonomic pathways of the autonomic nervous system.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} {{are usually not}} subtle, although asymptomatic events have been documented. <b>Autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> differs from autonomic instability, the various modest cardiac and neurological changes that accompany a spinal cord injury, including bradycardia, orthostatic hypotension, and ambient temperature intolerance. In <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia,</b> patients will experience hypertension, sweating, spasms (sometimes severe spasms) and erythema (more likely in upper extremities) and may suffer from headaches and blurred vision. Mortality is rare with AD, but morbidity such as stroke, retinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema if left untreated can be quite severe. Older patients with very incomplete spinal cord injuries and systolic hypertension without {{symptoms are}} usually experiencing essential hypertension, not <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia.</b> Aggressive treatment of these elderly patients with rapidly acting antihypertensive medications can have disastrous results.|$|E
50|$|Drug {{treatment}} {{includes the}} rapidly acting vasodilators, including sublingual nitrates or oral clonidine. Ganglionic blockers {{are also used}} to control sympathetic nervous system outflow. Topical nitropaste is a convenient and safe treatment—an inch or two {{can be applied to}} the chest wall, and wiped off when blood pressures begin to normalize. <b>Autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> is abolished temporarily by spinal or general anaesthesia. These treatments are used during obstetric delivery of a woman with <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> {{itself can be}} life-threatening, and must also be {{completely}} investigated and treated appropriately to prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality.|$|E
50|$|Mecamylamine {{has been}} used as an orally-active ganglionic blocker in {{treating}} <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> and hypertension, but, like most ganglionic blockers, it is more often used now as a research tool.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> {{can become}} chronic and recurrent, often in {{response}} to longstanding medical problems like soft tissue ulcers or hemorrhoids. Long term therapy may include alpha blockers or calcium channel blockers.|$|E
50|$|The Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine has {{developed}} evidence-based clinical practice {{guidelines for the}} management of <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> in adults, children, and pregnant women. There is also a consumer version of this guideline.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} cause of hyperreflexia is spinal cord injury (see <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia).</b> Standard stimuli like the filling of the bladder can cause {{excessive}} responses from the nervous system, such causes are not known.|$|E
50|$|Secondarily, {{because of}} their {{depressed}} functioning and immobility, people with tetraplegia are often more vulnerable to pressure sores, osteoporosis and fractures, frozen joints, spasticity, respiratory complications and infections, <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia,</b> deep vein thrombosis, and cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5000|$|Another form of doping is [...] "boosting", used by {{athletes with}} a {{spinal cord injury}} to induce <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> and {{increase}} blood pressure. This was banned by the IPC in 1994 but is still an ongoing problem in the sport.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{secondary}} {{medical problems}} {{are associated with}} catastrophic spinal cord injury. These include cardiovascular complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia,</b> altered thermoregulation, and changes to cardiac function {{as a result of}} injury to the sympathetic nervous system.|$|E
5000|$|Ganglionic {{blockers}} {{are used}} less frequently {{now than they}} were in the past, because antihypertensives with fewer side effects are now available. Hexamethonium has been described as the [...] "first effective antihypertensive drug". However, they are still used in some emergency situations, such as aortic dissection or <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hyperreflexia (or hyper-reflexia) {{is defined}} as overactive or overresponsive reflexes. Examples of this can include {{twitching}} or spastic tendencies, which are indicative of upper motor neuron disease {{as well as the}} lessening or loss of control ordinarily exerted by higher brain centers of lower neural pathways (disinhibition). See <b>Autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> (AD), {{also known}} as {{autonomic}} hyperreflexia, is a potentially life-threatening condition which {{can be considered a}} medical emergency requiring immediate attention. AD occurs most often in individuals with spinal cord injuries with spinal lesions above the T6 spinal cord level, although it has been known to occur in patients with a lesion as low as T10.|$|E
5000|$|For {{women with}} {{injuries}} above T6, a risk during labor and delivery that threatens {{both mother and}} fetus is <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia,</b> in which the blood pressure increases to dangerous levels high enough to cause potentially deadly stroke.

50|$|Boosting is {{a method}} of {{inducing}} <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> {{with the intention of}} enhancing performance in sport. It can be used by an athlete with a spinal cord injury to increase their blood pressure and is performed by causing a painful stimulus in {{the lower part of the}} body. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) banned the practice in 1994, but many competitors with spinal injuries are still thought to be using it as a performance enhancer.|$|E
50|$|Another risk is <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> (AD), {{a medical}} {{emergency}} involving dangerously high blood pressure. People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment.

In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E
50|$|People with spinal {{injuries}} at T6 {{or higher}} {{are more likely}} to develop <b>Autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> (AD). It also sometimes rarely effects people with injuries at T7 and T8. The condition causes over-activity of the autonomic nervous system, and can suddenly onset when people are playing sports. Some of the symptoms include nausea, high blood pressure, a pounding headache, flushed face, profuse sweating, a lower heart rate or a nasal congestion. If left untreated, it can cause a stroke. Players in some sports like wheelchair rugby are encouraged to be particularly on guard for AD symptoms.|$|E
50|$|One {{condition}} that occurs typically in lesions above the T6 level is <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> (AD), {{in which the}} blood pressure increases to dangerous levels, high enough to cause potentially deadly stroke. It results from an overreaction of the system to a stimulus such as pain {{below the level of}} injury, because inhibitory signals from the brain cannot pass the lesion to dampen the excitatory sympathetic nervous system response. Signs and symptoms of AD include anxiety, headache, nausea, ringing in the ears, blurred vision, flushed skin, and nasal congestion. It can occur shortly after the injury or not until years later.|$|E
50|$|The risk is {{greatest}} with cervical {{spinal cord}} lesions and is rare with lesions below T6 thoracic vertebrae. It {{has rarely been}} reported in spinal cord lesions as low as T10. The first episode may occur weeks to years after spinal cord injury takes place, but most people at risk (80%) develop their first episode within {{the first year after}} injury. Once a person has their first episode of <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia,</b> the next 7-10 days are critical because there is a high incidence of recurrence within that time. Some people describe this predisposition as an easily excitable autonomic nervous system.|$|E
50|$|The IPC made {{boosting}} {{illegal in}} 1994. Their handbook states in Chapter 4.3:An athlete with a {{systolic blood pressure}} of 180mm Hg or above will be re-examined approximately ten minutes after the first examination. If on the second examination the systolic blood pressure remains above 180mm Hg the person {{in charge of the}} examination shall inform the Technical Delegate to withdraw the athlete from the particular competition in question.Any deliberate attempt to induce <b>Autonomic</b> <b>Dysreflexia</b> is forbidden and will be reported to the Technical Delegate. The athlete will be disqualified from the particular competition regardless of the systolic blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|Proper {{treatment}} of <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> involves administration of anti-hypertensives along with immediate determination and {{removal of the}} triggering stimuli. Often, sitting the patient up and dangling legs over the bedside can reduce blood pressures below dangerous levels and provide partial symptom relief. Tight clothing and stockings should be removed. Straight catheterization of the bladder every 4 to 6 hrs, or relief of a blocked urinary catheter tube may resolve the problem. The rectum should be cleared of stool impaction, using anaesthetic lubricating jelly. If the noxious precipitating trigger cannot be identified, drug treatment is needed to decrease elevating intracranial pressure until further studies can identify the cause.|$|E
50|$|In {{spinal cord}} {{injuries}} above T6, neurogenic shock may occur, {{from the loss of}} autonomic innervation from the brain. Parasympathetic is preserved but the synergy between sympathetic and parasympathetic system is lost in cervical and high thoracic SCI lesions. Sacral parasympathetic loss may be encountered in lesions below T6 or T7. Cervical lesions cause total loss of sympathetic innervation and lead to vasovagal hypotension and bradyarrhythmias - which resolve in 3-6 weeks. <b>Autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia</b> is permanent, and occurs from Phase 4 onwards. It is characterized by unchecked sympathetic stimulation below the SCI (from a loss of cranial regulation), leading to often extreme hypertension, loss of bladder or bowel control, sweating, headaches, and other sympathetic effects.|$|E
50|$|Pressure ulcers {{can trigger}} other ailments, cause {{considerable}} suffering, {{and can be}} expensive to treat. Some complications include <b>autonomic</b> <b>dysreflexia,</b> bladder distension, bone infection, pyarthroses, sepsis, amyloidosis, anemia, urethral fistula, gangrene and very rarely malignant transformation (Marjolin's ulcer - secondary carcinomas in chronic wounds).
