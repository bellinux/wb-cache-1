500|$|In June 2011, Julian re-joined {{his former}} club, now renamed simply Stevenage, on a free transfer, {{three years after}} leaving the club. The move meant that Julian would be playing under the {{management}} of Graham Westley once more, who first brought Julian to Stevenage in 2005 – Westley said [...] "Alan sees the opportunity {{in the long term}} and we all know how much quality he will bring into the squad. He is a different type of character but another man that you would happily go into the trenches with". On signing for Stevenage, Julian said [...] "I had a great time at Stevenage before and coming back now <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> League One, it is a dream come true". As a result of Chris Day dislocating his finger, Julian started in the club's first game of the 2011–12 campaign, keeping a clean sheet in Stevenage's 0–0 home draw against Exeter City. He played the first three games of the season, before first choice goalkeeper Chris Day returned from injury. Julian made just two further appearances during the campaign; in a 2–2 draw with AFC Wimbledon in the Football League Trophy, and an appearance as a second-half substitute in Stevenage's 2–2 home draw against Huddersfield Town. He was released by Stevenage when his contract expired in May 2012.|$|E

He further explained to the science journal Nature, [...] "That's why Darwinism, and the fact of evolution, is of great importance, because it is that attitude which has led to the devastation of so much, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the situation that we are in." ...|$|E

Former United States President Jimmy Carter [...] "wished Kim Jong-un every success as he assumes his new responsibility of leadership, looking forward to another visit to the DPRK in the future", according to a KCNA statement. Carter visited North Korea on several occasions prior to Kim Jong Il's death to discuss North Korea's nuclear weapon program.|$|E
500|$|The ANAK Society {{explained}} {{its name}} as originating from {{a passage in}} the Book of Numbers, one of the books of the Hebrew Bible. The passage, attributed to , reads, [...] "And there were the Nephilin, the sons of ANAK, who came of the giants: <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> our own sight as grasshoppers, <b>and</b> so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> their sight." [...] Anak was a biblical figure {{said to be the}} forefather of the Nephilim, a race of giants. For unknown reasons, the society's name has sustained minor alterations over the years, from Anak in the 1908 Blue Print, the first edition of Georgia Tech's yearbook, to ANAK in recent editions of The Technique, Georgia Tech's student newspaper.|$|R

2500|$|Even some of Ali's early {{followers}} {{regarded him}} as [...] "an absolute and divinely guided leader who could demand {{of them the}} same kind of loyalty that would have been expected for the Prophet." [...] For example, one of Ali's supporters who also was devoted to the Prophet said to him: [...] "our opinion is your opinion <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the palm of your right hand." [...] The early followers of ‘Ali seem to have taken his guidance as [...] "right guidance" [...] deriving from Divine support. In other words, ‘Ali's guidance was seen to be the expression of God's will and the Qur'anic message. This spiritual and absolute authority of ‘Ali was known as walayah and it was inherited by his successors, the Imams. In the first century after the Prophet, the term sunnah was not specifically defined as [...] "Sunnah of the Prophet" [...] but was used in connection to Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, Uthman, and some Umayyad Caliphs. The idea of [...] "Hadith" [...] or traditions ascribed to the Prophet was not mainstream nor was Hadith criticism. Even the earliest legal texts by Malik b. Anas and Abu Hanifa employ many methods including analogical reasoning and opinion and do not rely exclusively on hadith. Only in the 2nd century does the Sunni jurist al-Shafi‘i first argue that only the Sunnah of the Prophet should be a source of law and that this Sunnah is embodied in Hadiths. It would take another one hundred years after al-Shafi‘i for Sunni Muslim jurists to fully base their methodologies on prophetic Hadiths. Meanwhile, Imam Shia Muslims followed the Imams' interpretations of Islam as normative without any need for Hadiths and other sources of Sunni law such as analogy and opinion.|$|E
