5|$|At {{the same}} time, Abu'l-Abbas {{set out from}} Damascus <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Ramlah, during which he learned of Khumarawayh's arrival in Syria. At this point, however, the Abbasid {{offensive}} was hampered by a dispute between its commanders, which was caused when Abu'l-Abbas accused Ishaq ibn Kundaj and Ibn Abu'l-Saj of cowardice. In response to this insult, the two generals decided to abandon the campaign, and left Abu'l-Abbas to face Khumarawayh's forces by himself.|$|E
5|$|El Occidente {{was handed}} over to the War Shipping Administration at Galveston on 7 July and {{assigned}} to United States Lines, Inc., for operation. The cargo ship was placed under Panamanian registry by U.S. Lines. Little is known of El Occidentes movements over the six months, but on 30 January 1942, she left Boston for Halifax loaded with a general cargo. Arriving at Halifax on 1 February, she joined Convoy HX 174 <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Liverpool on 7 February, arriving at her destination on 21 February.|$|E

The battalion, being too weak, only managed to liberate around half of the village, and had to await {{the arrival of the}} 1st Commando Brigade later in the day to complete its capture.|$|E

They finally arrived in London on 22 October.|$|E
5|$|The Greek War of Independence {{had started}} on the March 17, 1821, when the Maniots {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire at Areopoli. On March 21, the Maniot army of 2,000 men {{under the command of}} Petros Mavromichalis which also included Theodoros Kolokotronis, marched from Areopolis <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Messenia. The next day, they reached Kalamata, which had an Ottoman garrison and they captured the city on March 23.|$|E

5|$|The heavy {{opposition}} that was expected never materialized, so the landing forces moved inland rapidly. As fire support from Texass guns {{was no longer}} required, she departed the southern coast of France on the early morning of 17 August.

5|$|As the Ju 87s {{reached the}} coast, the {{respective}} groups split off <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> their assigned targets. By this time, some 15 {{miles off the}} Isle of Wight, the Bf 109s had caught up and were now zigzagging around the dive-bombers. Bode led III./StG 77 to attack from the northwest, dead into wind in order to bomb accurately. Usually the Ju 87s attacked in line astern, but Bode chose to attack in groups of three to split the anti-aircraft fire. To keep the enemy's heads down, he fired his machine guns in an 80-degree dive. He soon left an altitude of 13,000feet, releasing his bombs and pulling out at 2,275feet. The rest of his unit followed.|$|E
5|$|At 9:50 {{and under}} heavy {{pressure}} from the Greek fleet, the Ottoman ships completed a 16-point turn, which reversed their course, <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> {{the safety of the}} straits. The turn was poorly conducted, and the ships fell out of formation, blocking each other's fields of fire. Barbaros Hayreddin, Turgut Reis, and Mesudiye took several hits during the battle, though only Barbaros Hayreddin was significantly damaged. By 10:17, both sides had ceased firing and the Ottoman fleet withdrew into the Dardanelles. When they approached the straits, Mesudiye and Âsâr-ı Tevfik took up positions to cover the withdrawal of the damaged pre-dreadnoughts. The ships reached port by 13:00 and transferred their casualties to the hospital ship Resit Paşa.|$|E

5|$|Both Polish and Russian {{planners}} expected {{an attack}} on Warsaw—and Radzymin in particular—from the east. Yet the first fights started to the north-east of the Polish capital. Warsaw was to be assaulted from the east by the 16th Red Army. At {{the same time the}} 14th Red Army (under Ieronim Uborevich) captured Wyszków and started a fast march westwards, towards Toruń. It was then to cross the lower Vistula and assault Warsaw from the north-west. However, its 21st Rifle Division remained {{on the south side of}} the Bug River <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Warsaw directly, under orders from Russia's Commissar of War Leon Trotsky. Aided by the Russian 27th Rifle Division, it came into contact with the Polish forces at Radzymin on August 12, and prepared for an assault the following morning.|$|E
5|$|By 3 March, {{the convoy}} was {{within range of}} the air base at Milne Bay, and eight Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers from No. 100 Squadron RAAF took off from there. Because of bad weather only two found the convoy, and neither scored any hits, but the weather cleared after they rounded the Huon Peninsula. A force of 90 Allied {{aircraft}} took off from Port Moresby, <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Cape Ward Hunt, while 22 A-20 Bostons of No. 22 Squadron RAAF attacked the Japanese fighter base at Lae, reducing the convoy’s air cover. Attacks on the base continued throughout the day.|$|E
5|$|By January 1919, the {{regiment}} were {{still waiting to}} return home, and had begun education courses, continuation training and playing sports. This occupied them until March when a revolt broke out in Egypt, and {{the regiment}} drew its equipment back out of storage <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the Nile Delta. Posted to Quesna, all of the regiment's squadrons, except the 9th which went to Cairo, began policing the riots and trying to stop looting. Once the rioting had been quelled, the regiment once again waited to return home. Their return finally began on 30 June 1919, when {{the majority of the}} brigade left the Suez Canal for New Zealand and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment ceased to be a unit.|$|E

5|$|By now Nir had {{disengaged}} at El-Qantarah, {{leaving a}} battalion behind, and arrived opposite the Firdan bridge at 12:30 with two tank battalions. While Amir and Nir discussed {{plans for an}} attack, Keren arrived and Adan ordered him to support Nir and Amir by attacking towards Purkan. Meanwhile, Sharon left Tasa <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Suez City, leaving a single reconnaissance company to hold vital ridges such as Hamadia and Kishuf, but not the hills to the north, such as Hamutal. Instead, Keren's brigade gained responsibility for these areas, but Sharon's action further endangered Adan's position.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} leg of the flight, at about 15:00, Keč, wearing a winter coat, got up from his seat and walked {{to the front of the}} aircraft. A flight {{attendant}} stopped him. After talking for a short while, and another flight attendant came by, he was let into the cockpit. No information about the hijacking was given to the passengers until arrival at Bodø. Bodø Airport was evacuated and the aircraft parked at Bodø Main Air Station, the military section. After landing, by order of the hijacker, the passengers were informed that all women, children under 18 and people over 60 were to leave the aircraft. After this had happened, there were 77 passengers and four crew members left. The aircraft departed Bodø at about 16:00 <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which was closed for all other traffic.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{the four}} boats became separated. Bulkeley spent time {{looking for the}} other three boats, {{but was unable to}} find them in the darkness. At dawn he gave up, <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> one of the {{alternative}} hiding places. Kelly's PT-34 was the first to reach the rendezvous point, a cove on Tagauayan Island, two hours late at 09:30. There was no sign of the other boats, and Rockwell, in the same boat with Kelly, was far from convinced that Kelly had found the correct island. Some repairs were made, and the boat was refueled by hand pumps from the drums. Two men were posted atop the island's tallest hill to watch out for the Japanese and the other boats.|$|E

5|$|During the {{previous}} night, at 20:00 September 4, General Walker {{had ordered the}} 1st Provisional Marine Brigade released from operational control of the 2nd Division effective at midnight, September 5. He had vainly protested against releasing the brigade, believing he needed it and all the troops then in Korea {{if he were to}} stop the North Korean offensive against the Pusan Perimeter. At 00:15, September 6, the marines began leaving their lines at Obong-ni Ridge <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Pusan.

5|$|From {{the area}} of Daugavpils she entered Lithuania, where in April 1831 her unit is rumored to have seized the town of Zarasai, {{although}} the historians are not sure this event really occurred. She planned to take Daugavpils, but after a reconnaissance mission discovered {{that the city was}} defended by a strong garrison and was impregnable to attack by such a small force as her own unit, that plan was abandoned. She then returned to Samogitia <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Panevėžys, where on 30 April she joined forces with the unit commanded by Karol Załuski. On May 4, she fought at the battle of Prastavoniai; shortly afterwards, with Konstanty Parczewski, she fought at Maišiagala. On 5 May, she witnessed General Dezydery Chłapowski entering the area with a large force and taking command over all units fighting in the former Grand Duchy.|$|E
