5|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{the police}} characters from other television detectives, Simon {{makes the point}} that even the best police of The Wire are motivated not by <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, The Wire does not minimize or gloss over the horrific effects of their actions.|$|E
