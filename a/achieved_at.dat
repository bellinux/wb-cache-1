5|$|Although Umar later {{relieved}} him of high command, he nevertheless {{remained the}} effective {{leader of the}} forces arrayed against the Byzantines {{during the early stages}} of the Byzantine–Arab Wars. Under his command, Damascus was captured in 634 and the key Arab victory against the Byzantine forces was <b>achieved</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Yarmouk (636), which led to the conquest of the Bilad al-Sham (Levant).|$|E
5|$|Attendances {{have gone}} down since all-seater stadia were introduced, with many records set at the terraced grounds they replaced. In several cases records were <b>achieved</b> <b>at</b> a former ground rather than the club's current location. For example, Wigan Athletic's record was set at Springfield Park, not their current home, the DW Stadium.|$|E
5|$|In {{sections}} of the front where German and Belgian troops faced each other in December 1914, {{there was at least}} one such instance when a truce was <b>achieved</b> <b>at</b> the request of Belgian soldiers who wished to send letters back to their families, over the German-occupied parts of their own country.|$|E

5|$|Several {{improvements}} {{were made}} to image filters and their theory of operation by Otto Zobel. Zobel coined the term constant k filter (or k-type filter) to distinguish Campbell's filter from later types, notably Zobel's m-derived filter (or m-type filter). The particular problems Zobel was trying to address with these new forms were impedance matching into the end terminations and improved steepness of roll-off. These were <b>achieved</b> <b>at</b> {{the cost of an}} increase in filter circuit complexity.|$|E
5|$|Shearer {{did not get}} the manager's job on {{permanent}} basis. Chris Hughton {{stepped up}} from the coaching staff to take charge of the quest to get Newcastle back into the Premier League, which was <b>achieved</b> <b>at</b> the first attempt as Newcastle finished top of the Championship in the 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|The victory, <b>achieved</b> <b>at</b> {{relatively}} little cost, cleared the Lado Enclave of Mahdist rebels and secured Rejaf as a Belgian base for future {{operations in the}} surrounding territories and along the Nile. Rejaf became the seat of government within the Lado Enclave, and remained thus when the British eventually reclaimed the territory in 1910.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} {{step in the}} process of acceptance back into the Olympic Movement was <b>achieved</b> <b>at</b> a ceremony held in Cardiff in November 1994, when the IRB was officially confirmed as a Recognised International Federation of the IOC. At that ceremony, International Olympic Committee President, Juan Antonio Samaranch, pointed out that rugby's history and values were very much in tune with the Olympic philosophy and traditions. This historic meeting in Cardiff led to IRB representation at annual IOC meetings and consideration for inclusion in the programme of future Olympic Games. In 2002, a plan was presented to induct rugby sevens, golf and the Chinese martial art of wushu.|$|E
5|$|Adam Berry, the show's {{original}} score composer, used {{sound synthesis}} to simulate a small orchestra, and frequently alluded to existing famous pieces of music. Berry also used signature acoustic guitar and mandolin cues as leitmotifs for the show's establishing shots. After Berry left in 2001, Jamie Dunlap and Scott Nickoley of the Los Angeles-based Mad City Production Studios provided the show's original {{music for the}} next seven seasons. Since 2008, Dunlap has been credited as the show's sole score composer. Dunlap's contributions to the show {{are one of the few}} that are not <b>achieved</b> <b>at</b> the show's own production offices. Dunlap reads a script, creates a score using digital audio software, and then e-mails the audio file to South Park Studios, where it is edited to fit with the completed episode.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the classification, cyclists {{received}} points for finishing in the top 10 in a stage. For stages, 1, 2 and 4 the win earned 25points, second place 22, third 20, fourth 18, fifth 16, sixth 14, seventh 12, eighth 10, ninth 8 and tenth 6. For stages 5, 6, 7 and 8 the win earned 15points, second place 12, third 10, fourth 8, fifth 6, and 1 point fewer per place down to a single point for 10th. Points towards the classification could also be <b>achieved</b> <b>at</b> each of the intermediate sprints; these points {{were given to the}} top three riders through the line with 5points for first, 3 for second, and 1 point for third.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, Tsar Alexander I laid all {{the blame}} on M. I. Kutuzov, Commander-in-chief of the Allied Army. However, {{it is clear that}} Kutuzov's plan was to retreat farther to the rear where the Allied Army had a sharp {{advantage}} in logistics. Had the Allied Army retreated further, they might have been reinforced by Archduke Charles's troops from Italy, and the Prussians might have joined the coalition against Napoleon. A French army {{at the end of her}} supply lines, in a place which had no food supplies, might have faced a very different ending from the one they <b>achieved</b> <b>at</b> the real battle of Austerlitz. This essentially was Kutuzov's successful strategy in 1812, after the Battle of Borodino.|$|E

5|$|Finland placed {{second on}} the table, {{collecting}} four gold medals amongst a total of eleven. Clas Thunberg won five of their medals, achieving a medal {{in each of the}} speed skating events he took part in; collecting three gold medals, one silver and one bronze. Eight of the competing nations <b>achieved</b> <b>at</b> least one gold medal, with only Belgium and the hosts, France, medalling without winning a gold medal. One medal was reallocated in 1974; during the games, Thorleif Haug of Norway had been awarded the bronze medal in the ski jumping, along with his three gold medals. A Norwegian historian discovered {{that there had been a}} scoring error, and an American, Anders Haugen had actually finished in third place. As Haug had died in 1934, his daughter presented Haugen, aged 83, with his medal.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 around 800pupils {{attended}} the school.

In 2006, 98.3% of pupils <b>achieved</b> <b>at</b> least 5 A*-C grades at GCSE compared to an average of 66.7% for all secondary schools in Trafford and a national UK average of 61.3%; 97.5% of its pupils gained at least 5 A*-C grades at GCSE including English and maths, ranking the school 4th out of Trafford's 19 secondary schools.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{required}} Mach2 performance at high altitudes, the exhaust nozzles and air intake ramps were variable. Initially, it had been expected that a Mach1.2 performance could be <b>achieved</b> <b>at</b> low altitude, which required that titanium be used in critical areas in the fuselage and wing structure. The low altitude performance requirement was later lowered to Mach0.85, {{reducing the amount of}} titanium and therefore cost. A pair of small vanes mounted near the nose are part of an active vibration damping system that smooths out the otherwise bumpy low-altitude ride. The first three B-1As featured the escape capsule that ejected the cockpit with all four crew members inside. The fourth B-1A was equipped with a conventional ejection seat for each crew member.|$|E
