It can be denoted by the symbols NH3(aq). It is sometimes {{thought of as a}} solution of ammonium hydroxide. Although the name ammonium hydroxide suggests an alkali with composition NH4+OH−, it is actually impossible to isolate samples of NH4OH. The ions NH4+ and OH− do not account for a significant fraction of the total amount of ammonia except in extremely dilute solutions.|$|E

40|$|In partial {{fulfilment}} of the National Diploma in Horticulture of the Royal New Zealand Institute of Horticulture. The {{object of}} this study is to evaluate recent advances in the use of anhydrous and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> as nitrogenous fertilisers, with emphasis on the prospects and needs there are for their usage in New Zealand. There is at present a large dependence on New Zealand made organic and imported artificial fertilisers which are mostly low analysis materials. These nitrogenous fertilisers, with their low nitrogen content, have a high cost per pound of nitrogen. Anhydrous and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> are high analysis materials whose use could prove worthwhile in this country on the grounds of economy and practicability. An appraisal of these prospects would appear to offer advantages in the development of horticulture (and agriculture) in New Zealand. Part I deals with the aspects of nitrogen in the soil and in plants. This introduces the trends in nitrogenous fertilisers and usage of the various forms, particularly anhydrous and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia.</b> Also dealt with is the history of nitrogenous fertilisers. Part II illustrates the usage of ammonia as a fertiliser. The manufacture, use for crops, equipment and basic economics are discussed, with a view to demonstrating that anhydrous and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> fertilisers have been shown to be both efficient and very economical fertilisers overseas. Part III deals with the position in New Zealand. The types of nitrogen fertilisers used and the economic aspects of their usage. Prospects for anhydrous and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> in New Zealand are looked at. In conclusion the general findings are summarised and recommendations are made with a view to future needs in New Zealand for anhydrous and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia.</b> This thesis attempts to tentatively answer the question, "Is there a place for anhydrous and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> fertiliser in New Zealand, and what action should be taken to examine this subject more closely"...|$|E

The current dual effect VAR system has two generators, {{to meet the}} choice of only power/only cooling/both power and cooling. The strong refrigerant solution (<b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia)</b> from the absorber is divided in to two streams and one flows to the first generator and heats by solar thermal heat, then turbine. This produces the maximum power to the maximum vapour <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> as inlet to the turbine and these changes with temperature and pressure and made the cooler effect at exit of turbine.

It {{was based on}} the nucleophilic addition reaction between lactose and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia.</b> The carbonyl group of lactose can be changed into imido group, and this increases the electrochemical activity in reduction and the sensitivity. The optimal condition for the nucleophilic addition reaction was investigated and it was found that in NH 4 Cl–NH 3 buffer of pH 10. 1, the linear range between the peak current and the concentration of lactose was 0. 6 – 8. 4 mg L− 1, and the detection limits was 0. 44 mg L− 1.

40|$|M. Eng. The {{need and}} problem was {{originated}} from the trends of the earths dwindling energy resource. As time progresses humans {{are becoming more}} aware of need to use so called “alternative energy sources” to alleviate the main energy converters i. e. power stations. The student was tasked with investigating the thermal performance of a solar powered refrigeration cycle (prototype) that could: produce enough refrigeration effect that it replaces the standard home vapour compression unit, used for cooling or freezing of foods, heats up a geyser sufficiently to have hot water for a common house hold, has excess energy to heat or cool liquid or air based environments and {{has the potential to}} lower the electrical bill of a house. The introductory step was to obtain the thermo fluid properties of <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> solutions. A setback came about when determining the <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> properties. There were too many conflicting properties being yielded by six different authors. In an attempt to gain confidence in only one author a comparison table was prepared. The table compared the six authors to each other. By looking at all the values compared it brought great clarity to the problem. When continuing the research into the fundamental law approach of solving for the cycle new findings were made. Initially very little comprehensive studies were done which explained in fundamental laws to solve for the absorption cycle. After extensive reviewing of a detailed study on how to solve for absorption refrigeration cycles, then it was able to begin improving on the thermo – fluid design of the cycle. As cycle and component design began to progress the train of thought began to steer in a direction. Each component needed to be detail designed. The advantage of having each component specifically catered for in the cycle design was that it would increase the cycle efficiency. In this way it would ensure that during the concept generation phase the functioning of each component was clear, thereby enabling a clear understanding of how components would compliment each other in a cycle. A mode of solving for the cycle was to endeavour that all parameters could be calculated unambiguously, with the aid of computerisation. Testing was carried out on a real life commercial thermal siphoning machine in order to realistically understand how absorption refrigeration works and gain experience. At {{the end of the study}} the most important result is that the dissertation research shows strong evidence that it will be possible to create a device which can fulfil the four tasks listed above. Another result is a program which is a refined cycle design of the pump absorption type refrigeration. The program solves for points along the cycle. Lastly it was found that even though EES was the simpler program to use for <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> solution properties it was the only program which catered for sub cooling and super heating...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} a comprehensive modelling and simulation of a heat-driven gravity-assisted solution pump for an <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> absorption refrigeration unit. The pump {{is essentially a}} hermetic vessel located at an intermediate elevation between the absorber and generator. It is connected to both components with vapour and liquid tubes. The flow in the vapour tubes is controlled by solenoid valves, while a regulating valve and two non-return valves are incorporated in the liquid tubes. The developed pump overcomes the leakage problem which is still a major constraint in developing ammonia-water refrigeration and heat pumping systems of small capacities. The simulation results revealed that {{the diameter of the}} pump vessel has no effect on its flow rate. The elevation differences have a slight effect on the flow rate. The most important parameters are the diameter of the liquid tubes and the pressure loss coefficients of the incorporated regulating and non-return valves.

40|$|Nitrogen {{fertilizer}} use in Wisconsin as anhydrous ammonia, urea-ammonium nitrate solutions, and urea {{ranged from}} about 148, 000 to 213, 000 tons of N during the 1995 - 2000 period (Terry and Kirby, 2001). This amount {{is similar to}} that used about 10 years earlier when 170, 000 tons of N was used in 1984. However, a substantial materials shift has occurred since 1984 when about 56 % of the N used as the major three sources was urea or N solutions. The percentage of urea-containing materials has increased to 80 % in 1999 and 76 % in 2000. This increased utilization of urea-containing fertilizers parallels the national trend and emphasizes the need to manage urea effectively. The increased utilization of urea-containing fertilizers in Wisconsin has occurred largely at the expense of anhydrous ammonia which has experienced a reduced market share from about 44 % of the N in 1984 to 20 to 25 % of the three major N sources at present. Nitrogen utilization from other N sources ranges from about 16, 000 to 25, 000 tons of N annually and includes materials such as ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, ammonium thiosulfate, <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia,</b> calcium nitrate and others.

In our experimental results, the etch rate of the transparent oxide semiconductor (TOS) films by using acid solutions ranked accordingly from high to low are IZO, IGZO, IGO and ITO. Comparatively, the etch rate of the TOS films by using alkaline ammonia solution ranked from high to low are IGZO, IZO, IGO and ITO, in that order. Using the proposed wet etching process with high etch selectivity, bottom-gate-type thin-film transistors (TFTs) based on a-IGZO channels and Y(2) O(3) gate-insulators were fabricated by radio-frequency sputtering on plastic substrates. The wet etch processed TFT with 30 mu m gate length and 120 mu m gate width exhibits a saturation mobility of 46. 25 cm(2) V(- 1) s(- 1), a threshold voltage of 1. 3 V, a drain current on-off ratio > 10 (6), and subthreshold gate voltage swing of 0. 29 V decade(- 1).

40|$|Three {{nitrogen}} response {{studies were}} conducted in Iowa to compare {{the effect of a}} controlled release fertilizer, ESN, to urea and <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> (AA), on corn grain yields, biomass yields, and soil nitrate (NO 3 [...] N) and ammonium (NH 4 +-N) concentrations. Experiments were conducted at two sites from 2003 through 2007 for the spring-applied ESN/urea study, two sites from 2006 through 2007 for the fall and spring-applied ESN/AA study, and one site from 2006 through 2007 for the spring applied ESN/AA study. N rates in the studies were 0 - 202 kg ha- 1 in 34 kg N ha- 1 increments in the ESN/urea study and 0 - 202 kg N ha- 1 in 67 kg N ha- 1 increments in the fall and spring-applied ESN/AA studies. Four of nine site-years in the ESN/urea study had significantly higher corn grain yields due to ESN. One of four site-years in the fall and spring-applied study had higher grain yields to either fall or spring application of ESN. Neither year of the spring-applied ESN/AA study had significantly higher grain yields due to ESN. Biomass yields, the above ground portion of the plant minus the ear, were also collected at physiological maturity. None of the nine site-years in the ESN/urea study had a positive response to ESN. One of the four site-years in the fall and spring-applied ESN/AA study had a positive response to spring-applied ESN. Neither year of the spring-applied ESN/AA study had a positive response to ESN.

40|$|Chemical and {{biological}} interactions between soil N and alkaline-hydrolysing N fertilizers were studied in laboratory and glasshouse experiments. Chemical interactions were measured in y-irradiated soils, {{and biological}} interactions in non-irradiated or reinoculated y-irradiated samples incubated with 15 N-labelled urea, <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> or di-ammonium phosphate. The roles of NH 3 fixation by soil organic matter, chemical hydrolysis and dissolution of soil organic N and transformations of solubilized organic N in influencing {{the availability of}} soil N were evaluated in laboratory experiments. The interaction between foliar application of urea and the uptake of soil N by wheat and sunflower was studied in a glasshouse experiment. Recovery of fertilizer N in the organic fraction of y-irradiated soils {{was due to the}} process of NH 3 fixation. NH 3 fixation varied among soils, and up to 4. 6 % of <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> added at 1000 mg N kg- 1 soil was fixed by soil organic matter at day 7. The amount of NH 3 fixed increased with increasing rates of NH 3 (aq) and urea application. More than 55 % of the total NH 3 fixation measured 28 days after application of 2000 mg urea-N kg- 1 soil occurred in the first week. Soil pH and NH 3 fixation varied in response to N source, and increased in the order of di-ammonium phosphate urea > di-ammonium phosphate > ammonium sulphate at equivalent N concentration. Recovery of fertilizer N in the organic fraction of biologically-active soil was higher than y-irradiated soil due to immobilization. Biological immobilization of labelled N was similar for urea and diammonium phosphate applications, and increased slightly with increasing N application rate or incubation time. Positive added nitrogen interactions were observed in both y-irradiated and biologically-active samples. The ANI in the biologically active soil was greater compared to sterile soil, and both increased with rate of fertilizer application and time of incubation. When added nitrogen interactions due to chemical processes and pool substitution were taken into account, a real positive ANI due to biological factors (ANI (rb)) was measured in three soils. The ANI (rb) increased with rate of fertilizer application. This increase, together with increased immobilization and a measured decrease in fertilizer-induced soluble organic N during incubation, indicated that biological activity was enhanced through increased availability of substrate. The biological availability of organic N solubilized by NH 3 (aq) was determined in incubation experiments using 15 N-labelled and unlabelled substrates. The activity of heterotrophic microorganisms increased in response to the addition of unlabelled soluble organic N, as seen by higher gross rates of N mineralization and immobilization between day 0 and 7. However, the measured response of net mineralization was significant only when the rate of organic N addition exceeded 100 mg N kg- 1 soil, or the rate of NH 3 (aq) addition was equal to or greater than 1500 mg N kg- 1 soil. A constant proportion of approximately one-quarter of the labelled organic N added at different rates was recovered in the mineral N pool at day 14. Availability ratios calculated from net mineralization data indicated that fertilizer-induced solubilization of organic N increased its mineralization potential, and provided an explanation for the real added nitrogen interaction due to biological factors observed in N fertilized soil. The interaction between foliar application of urea to wheat and sunflower plants and the pool of available soil N accessible to plant roots was investigated in a glasshouse experiment using two soils of low and moderate N status. Fertilizer absorption was dependent on the sink size of the plant, and increased curvilinearly with the number of fertilizer applications. Dry matter production and its partitioning between tops and roots varied between soils and plants, and there was a significant soil-plant interaction. Plants grown in the N-deficient soil responded to urea application, and significant correlations between root dry matter or soil N uptake and plant N derived from fertilizer were obtained. A negative added nitrogen interaction observed for wheat sampled at day 33 in the N-deficient soil was due to less root growth as N derived from fertilizer increased. However, soil N uptake was higher in fertilized compared to unfertilized plants at 54 days after sowing due to bigger and more efficient root systems. i. e. there was a real positive added nitrogen interaction.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to study the availability of solar energy at Baghdad, Iraq for utilisation to produce refrigeration at 10 1 temperatures {{where it will be}} applicable for cold stores and freezer rooms and to prepare design data for such applications. Five years meteorological data are obtained from Baghdad Weather Bureau and the study is based on the averaged data for these five years. The total energy available is collected by a three covers flat plate collector with selective coating applied to the absorber plate surface. The parameters influencing the best year round thermal performance of the solar collector are investigated. These parameters are mainly, the collector tilt and the heat transfer media temperatures. The optimum tilt of the collector for summer operation of an air conditioning system is 200 from the horizontal facing the equator, 300 for year round performance of refrigeration system, the case under consideration, and 500 for winter operation where only heating is needed. The instantaneous efficiency of the collector varies during the day from a minimum of 0. 04 during the morning and afternoon to a maximum of 0. 55 between 9 a. m. - 4 p. m. Also the efficiency increases with a decrease in the temperature difference between the inlet fluid and the ambient air. The useful energy collected at the optimum tilt of 300 for year round performance and at different collection temperatures are then applied to an <b>aqua</b> <b>ammonia</b> absorption refrigeration system to produce a refrigeration effect. The thermal performance of the refrigeration system is investigated for different evaporator temperatures, condenser temperatures and pressures, solution concentrations and generator temperatures. The solar energy collected in excess of the immediate operating requirement is stored in liquid refrigerant for usage during the night and daytime periods of no or low solar radiation. Storage of liquid refrigerant with its potential for producing a refrigeration effect by evaporation was chosen instead of the alternative of storing energy from the flat plate collector directly. Thermal storage at medium temperatures is only practicable at present using liquid or solid storage media. The promise of using phasechange materials as a means of thermal energy storage has not yet proved practicable due to breakdown during recycling and supercooling problems. Liquid or solid storage give rise to problems because of the size of storage vessel needed and the attendant need to insulate such a vessel efficiently. These last factors have obvious implications in relation to initial capital cost. The results obtained are then analysed to find the best year round performance of the solar refrigeration system per unit area of the solar collector at the most preferable operating conditions of the refrigeration system...|$|E
