6000|$|... 'There, {{throw away}} that stupid, ugly, shapeless philosopher's cloak. So! You {{have on the}} white tunic I gave you? And now you look {{as a human being}} should. And you have been to the baths to-day? Well--you have the comfort of feeling now like other people, and having that <b>alabaster</b> <b>skin</b> as white as it was created, instead of being tanned like a brute's hide. Drink, I say! Ay--what was that face, that figure, made for? Bring a mirror here, hussy! There, look in that and judge for yourself? Were those lips rounded for nothing? Why were those eyes set in your head, and made to sparkle bright as jewels, sweet as {{mountain}} honey? Why were those curls laid ready for soft fingers to twine themselves among them, and look all the whiter among the glossy black knots? Judge for yourself!' ...|$|E
60|$|Nigel Ennison walked {{towards his}} club the most puzzled man in London. There could not, he decided, {{possibly}} be two girls so much alike. Besides, she had admitted her identity. And yet--he {{thought of the}} supper party where he had met Annabel Pellissier, the stories about her, his own few minutes' whispered love-making! He was a self-contained young man, but his cheeks grew hot {{at the thought of}} the things which it had seemed quite natural to say to her then, but which he knew very well would have been instantly resented by the girl whom he had just left. He went over her features one by one in his mind. They were the same. He could not doubt it. There was the same airy grace of movement, the same deep brown hair and <b>alabaster</b> <b>skin.</b> He found himself thinking up all the psychology which he had ever read. Was this the result of some strange experiment? It was the person of Annabel Pellissier--the soul of a very different order of being.|$|E
6000|$|She was right. She {{had no need}} of such gems. Was not {{her hair}} golden and her <b>skin</b> <b>alabaster?</b> Were not her lips coral and her teeth pearls? And were not {{diamonds}} of the purest water dropping at that moment from her down-cast eyes? ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the year}} 1805 the Princess finally {{broke up with}} her husband and went to Europe. The couple had no children. She {{traveled}} so extensively that she had a special carriage made, with an elegant ladder that allowed her to climb in and out of it comfortably. It had a bed inside, and all the luggage was placed on the outside. She called her carriage her dormez (дормез) or 'sleeper'; this was the time when she {{came to be known as}} [...] "the Wandering Countess". Prince Bagration called her back to Russia a number of times, and sent her so many letters that even her friends tried to persuade her to go; she remained abroad, however, using the excuse that she was sick and in need of medical treatment. In Europe Princess Bagration was a great success, and became well known in court circles. She became notorious everywhere and was called le Bel Ange Nu ("the beautiful nude angel") because of her passion for revealing dresses, and Chatte Blanche ("the White Cat"), because of her unlimited sensuality. Lord Palmerston noted in his memoirs that the Princess only wore translucent Indian muslin, which adhered closely to her figure. From her mother, however, she had inherited an angelic face, <b>alabaster</b> white <b>skin,</b> blue eyes, and a cascade of golden hair. Even when she was thirty it was said she still had the skin of a fifteen-year-old.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not quite}} know what he ought to say next. Here at last was his chance of an adventure, {{and he would be}} a fool not to take it; but it was a little ordinary, and he had {{expected}} more glamour. He had read many descriptions of love, and he felt in himself none of that uprush of emotion which novelists described; he was not carried off his feet in wave upon wave of passion; nor was Miss Wilkinson the ideal: he had often pictured to himself the great violet eyes and the <b>alabaster</b> <b>skin</b> of some lovely girl, and he had thought of himself burying his face in the rippling masses of her auburn hair. He could not imagine himself burying his face in Miss Wilkinson's hair, it always struck him as a little sticky. All the same it would be very satisfactory to have an intrigue, and he thrilled with the legitimate pride he would enjoy in his conquest. He owed it to himself to seduce her. He made up his mind to kiss Miss Wilkinson; not then, but in the evening; it would be easier in the dark, and after he had kissed her the rest would follow. He would kiss her that very evening. He swore an oath to that effect.|$|E

5000|$|Keppel was {{considered}} one of the most beautiful women of her time. She was hailed as one of the beauties of the [...] "naughty nineties". She was described as having <b>alabaster</b> <b>skin,</b> large blue eyes, a small waist, chestnut hair and a large bust.|$|E
50|$|The queen {{is painted}} with <b>alabaster</b> <b>skin</b> and a rouged face; small and almost doll-like under {{her hair and}} the very wide head-dress. Her bust is tightly encased in the bodice, her stiff farthingale shows her {{interest}} in fashion. Her face is painted with thick brush strokes and layers of opaque paint that thin towards the edges, where they appear, from x-radiograph, to have been applied in quick dabs.|$|E
50|$|She {{continued}} to have cosmetic surgeries as she lived her life of ease and wealth. Some time during the 2000s, however, she decided to repair her aging skin by having a full transplant - and as a donor she chose the heroine Icemaiden. She paid Warp to kidnap Icemaiden and then had Doctor Marten conduct the surgery. In the end Delores Winters had new <b>alabaster</b> <b>skin</b> while the heroine had been flayed alive. Icemaiden did not die, however, and eventually was placed, comatose, into a hydration womb within a facility of S.T.A.R. Labs.|$|E
50|$|Tall, voluptuous, with {{masses of}} brunette hair, slanting, heavy-lidded violet eyes, <b>alabaster</b> <b>skin,</b> and a sensuous, sulky mouth, Barbara Villiers was {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most beautiful of the Royalist women, but her lack of fortune left her with reduced marriage prospects. Her first serious romance was with Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield, but he was searching for a rich wife; he would wed Elizabeth Butler in 1660. On 14 April 1659 she married Roger Palmer (later 1st Earl of Castlemaine) against his family's wishes; his father predicted that she would make him one of the most miserable men in the world. Palmer was a Roman Catholic. The two separated in 1662, following the birth of her first son. They remained married for his lifetime, but it is believed that Palmer did not father any of his wife's children.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} to {{the myth of}} Leda and the swan. Leda is sometimes called Nemesis and other times they are two separate people. Leda was married to the king of Sparta, Tyndareus. [...] She {{is the mother of}} several children though she is most known for giving birth to Clytemnestra, Helen, Pollux, and Castor. The most common myth claims that Zeus transformed himself into a swan to couple with Leda. [...] Some versions claim that she loved Zeus and willing had sexual relations with him, while other versions claim she was seduced and therefore was not willing. [...] That same night, she coupled with Tyndareus also. Leda then gave birth to four children at the same time. The two pairs of twins resulted in Helen and Pollux belonging to Zeus, and Clytemnestra and Castor belonging to Tyndareus. Though each pair is attributed to either Zeus or Tyndareus, each man {{is said to be the}} father of all four children. [...] Castor and Pollux were called the Dioscuri meaning “Zeus’s sons,” even though Castor was mortal because he was the son of Tyndareus and Pollux was immortal because he was the son of Zeus. According to Hermes in Lucians’ The Dialogues of the Dead, Leda and her daughter (Helen of Troy) are the only women worthy of the title “beauties of old.” Rubens’s depictions of Leda clearly embody the phrase. With Leda’s curvy figure, <b>alabaster</b> <b>skin,</b> and golden hair, she is a sight to behold. Because Rubens was known for this type of female figures, Leda was the perfect subject to paint. Rubens became famous partly for his Rubenesque figures and were not common at the time, making his two Leda’s stand out even more.|$|E
5000|$|A {{new version}} of the Outsider appears in the Flashpoint reality. Michael Desai was born in Chandigarh, India, an infant meta-human with <b>alabaster</b> <b>skin</b> and superhuman durability. When his mother died during his birth (for which Desai's father blamed him), Desai created a {{sinkhole}} with a three-mile radius which killed thousands of people and left him the only survivor. How Desai accomplished this feat (and the extent of this power) is currently unknown. Years later, Michael adopted the alias of [...] "The Outsider" [...] (as he is both [...] "outside" [...] the law and the human race) and accumulates considerable wealth through (implied) illegal activities. This allows Desai to elevate India's status as a world power, turning the country into a multinational criminal operation completely under his control. The Outsider has also made many enemies; Rising Sun and Mister and Misses Terrific tried to assassinate him after Desai framed them when they revealed some of his illegal activities. The Outsider then killed all three would-be assassins and set out for the man who hired them. Desai is also engaged in a manhunt to find (and capture) a teenage electricity-based meta-human named Blackout, whom he believes can efficiently power mainland India with his abilities. Later, the Outsider was invited by the heroes of Earth to a meeting (arranged by Cyborg) about creating a group of heroes to deal with the Amazon-Atlantean War. The Outsider's reasons for supporting the heroes revolve around maintaining his empire; he responds to the threat of war by saying, [...] "War is bad for business. My business." [...] When Batman refuses to join the team the Outsider declines as well, stating [...] "the Outsider is out". Desai is revealed to have longevity, since he is shown to be active in Indian criminal and political affairs since the late 1970s. In 1979 the Outsider quelled the Bombay Riots by manipulating and subsequently killing the crime leaders responsible for the violence, uniting their organizations under his leadership. In 1996 the Outsider captured Isis in his Siberian Express on Novaya Zemlya in a bid to blackmail Black Adam into selling Desai his home country, Khandaq. However, when negotiating terms for Isis' release the Outsider attacked and defeated Black Adam with Durlan technology. The Outsider then shot Adam and threw him off the Siberian Express to join Isis as his trophy-prisoner. In the present day, the Outsider is shown interrogating the warden at the prison from which the assassins escaped. Although the warden claimed to know nothing about the prisoners' breakout, the Outsider shoots him and has his family sold into slavery in retribution for his incompetence. The Outsider's investigation then leads him to Khandaq, where he uncovers an encryption key which links Blackout to the assassination attempt. Later, Desai apparently confronts Blackout; however, he realizes that the man he is fighting is not Blackout but J'onn J'onzz in disguise. In 1985, the Outsider is revealed to have kept J'onn J'onzz captive in a secret research facility after stealing Doctor Erdel's teleportation device. After studying him and learning his weaknesses, the Outsider sold J'onn to Russia; he subsequently escaped, and seized the country. In the present day, after the Outsider talks with J'onn about the past J'onn admits to seeking revenge against Desai for torturing him and tries to kill him. During the battle, Outsider uses a salvaged teleportation device to trap J'onn within the Multiverse. After unsuccessfully questioning J'onn about future assassination attempts the Outsider closed the device with J'onn trapped inside, cutting him in half. Later, the Outsider returns to his base and contacts the heroes to join the assault on New Themyscira. and arrives on the scene to attack in the Atlantean-Amazon war.|$|E
