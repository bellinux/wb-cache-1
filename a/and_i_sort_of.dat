And then my father died <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> {{realized}} that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was a big boost.|$|E
500|$|Several poems from Yoko Ono's 1964 book Grapefruit {{inspired}} Lennon {{to write}} the lyrics for [...] "Imagine"—in particular, one which Capitol Records reproduced on the back cover of the original Imagine LP titled [...] "Cloud Piece", reads: [...] "Imagine the clouds dripping, dig a hole in your garden to put them in." [...] Lennon later said the composition [...] "should be credited as a Lennon/Ono song. A lot of it—the lyric and the concept—came from Yoko, but in those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> omitted her contribution, but it was right out of Grapefruit." [...] When asked about the song's meaning during a December 1980 interview with David Sheff for Playboy magazine, Lennon told Sheff that Dick Gregory had given Ono and him a Christian prayer book, which inspired him the concept behind [...] "Imagine".|$|E
500|$|The album's {{production}} expanded on that of The Chronic, with new, sparse {{beats and}} reduced use of samples which were prominent on his debut album. Co-producer Scott Storch talked of how Dr. Dre used his collaborators during recording sessions: [...] "At the time, I saw Dr. Dre desperately needed something. He needed a fuel injection, and Dre utilized {{me as the}} nitrous oxide. He threw me into the mix, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> tapped on a new flavor with my whole piano sound and the strings and orchestration. So I'd be on the keyboards, and Mike [...] was on the bass guitar, and Dre was on the drum machine." [...] Josh Tyrangiel of Time has described the recording process which Dr. Dre employs, stating [...] "Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine {{in a room full}} of trusted musicians. (They carry beepers. When he wants to work, they work.) He'll program a beat, then ask the musicians to play along; when Dre hears something he likes, he isolates the player and tells him how to refine the sound." ...|$|E

I must say, though, that frankly {{it never occurred to me}} that Keith's engine would be anything other than a tremendous success.

2500|$|Troubled by new acts he {{felt were}} imitating Radiohead, Yorke {{believed}} his music had {{become part of}} a constant background noise he described as [...] "fridge buzz", and became hostile to the music media. He told The Guardian: [...] "I always used to use music as a way of moving on and dealing with things, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> felt like that the thing that helped me deal with things had been sold to the highest bidder and I was simply doing its bidding. And I couldn't handle that." [...] He suffered from writer's block, and could not finish writing songs on guitar.|$|E
2500|$|Billie Whitelaw {{worked with}} Beckett for 25 years on such plays as Not I, Eh Joe, Krapp's Last Tape, and Footfalls and Rockaby. She first met Beckett in 1963. In her {{autobiography}} she describes {{their first meeting}} in 1963 was [...] "trust at first sight". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came {{to be regarded as}} his muse, the [...] "supreme interpreter of his work", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in Not I. She said of the play Rockaby: [...] "I put the tape in my head. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing Happy Days and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and he thought for a bit and then said, 'Inward' [...] ". She said of her role in Footfalls: [...] "I felt like a moving, musical Edvard Munch painting and, in fact, when Beckett was directing Footfalls he was not only using me to play the notes but I almost felt that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting." [...] "Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted", she explained. [...] "With all of Sam's work, the scream was there, my task was to try to get it out." [...] She stopped performing his plays in 1989 when he died.|$|E
5000|$|According to Michael Lang, legendary {{promoter}} of the Woodstock Festival of 1969, [...] "the Sound-Outs {{were kind of}} the spark for the Woodstock festival.

2500|$|Almost {{thirty years}} later Kelly told Alice Pitman of The Oldie that she was [...] "very bitter at the time, very, very bitter" [...] and {{recalled}} that Braden's producer, Desmond Wilcox, who subsequently married Rantzen, had brought together Kelly, Rantzen and newsreader Angela Rippon for a pilot of an afternoon show, although, in Kelly's view, [...] "it was just a front - he wanted Esther, <b>and</b> Angela <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> left dangling".|$|R

Of course, I knew there was no reason why Whittington should be in that room rather than in any other--less reason, in fact, for the betting would be on his being in one of the reception-rooms downstairs. But I guess I'd got the hump from standing so long in the rain, and anything seemed better than going on doing nothing. So I started up.|$|E

5000|$|After {{some years}} as a teacher, Cox became a sound {{engineer}} with the BBC in 1969.

5000|$|The {{original}} CD {{release of}} Real Nighttime on Enigma Records included three bonus tracks, {{only two of}} which were recorded by the Real Nighttime line-up. The third bonus track, a cover version of Todd Rundgren's [...] "Couldn't I Just Tell You," [...] was recorded in 1985 by the San Francisco-based line-up of Game Theory for the album The Big Shot Chronicles.

5000|$|Buskers and Angels is a {{rock musical}} written by Australian rock {{musician}} Jon English. This was his second self-penned musical, following Paris in 1990.Buskers and Angles {{is about a}} busker going from the streets to stardom as well as canvassing the pitfalls of the entertainment industry for women. English said [...] "It's probably the most misogynistic industry left" [...] and cites his feisty mother and suffragette grandmother as role models, and points out that both his musicals deliberately feature [...] "forthright, strong women trapped by circumstances but not by their own sex. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> miss that badly {{in a lot of}} musicals." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2013 Stinson {{released}} Hell And Half of Georgia, {{which was}} produced by R.S. Field.

Something that would stand alone among the country albums I love that I considered classics. I had the burning desire to do {{that for a long time}} and I did it on three records to the best of my ability. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> got it out of my system. I'm sort of exploring other music styles I've been influenced by over the years. This album's got a little muscle, it's a little tougher. The singing is better and the writing is better.

I would start writing a song, stop after 16 bars, hide it away in a drawer, look at it again, tear it up, destroy it."

5000|$|Newman {{later said}} {{the song was}} a major {{stepping}} point in his writing style. [...] "That {{was the first one}} I wrote like that. I was writing a song, believe it or not, for Frank Sinatra, Jr. And it was called something like “Susie” or “Mary” <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just all of the sudden couldn’t do it. So I ended up somewhere with “coat to wear” and “dancing bear”.

2500|$|Rowland Brown himself {{claimed to}} have knocked [...] Jack Dempsey down, {{and it is true}} that he once sparred with Dempsey, though it is unclear whether he {{actually}} knocked him down.

5000|$|I {{was on a}} CAP with my wingman <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> forced my {{way into}} the combat.

I was behind a MiG when my wingman yelled 'One, let me have him, let me have him', and I did the unthinkable - I said 'Have him'. I pulled out and let the wingman have him {{but he did not}} shoot him down. He got sandwiched between two MiGs, and instead of coming in after the trailing MiG, he came in after the leading MiG. I ordered him to break, I came in and I shot down the two of them.|$|E
5000|$|Higgins {{spoke of}} bad {{experiences}} with bigger artists to Literally magazine in 2009:"Everything about us is about enormous enthusiasm for something. And therefore big artists {{can come in}} and they think [...] "they're the flavour of the whatever, let's take their thing and then we'll do what we want with it..." [...] Well, no, that's not acceptable anyway. I've had that experience happen where the big artists were fine until they got into the mix room and then they basically pulled the record to pieces. So I took my name off the record and the writing credits off the record. Because they're assholes. And they sold about 20,000 copies, and they've never been seen since. So big artists are often jerks of the biggest order. And often people say don't meet your heroes because you'll be let down, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> understand why people would say that." ...|$|E
