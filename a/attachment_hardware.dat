Our method is completely automatic, handles per-pixel, spatially-varying blur, and out-performs the current leading image-based methods. Our experiments show that it handles large kernels – up to at least 100 pixels, with a typical size of 30 pixels. We also present a method to perform “ground-truth” measurements of camera motion blur. We use this method to validate our hardware and deconvolution approach.

40|$|A novel full-inversion-based {{technique}} for quantitative ultrasound elastography {{was investigated in}} a pilot clinical study on five patients for non-invasive detection and localization of prostate cancer and quantification of its extent. Conventional-frequency ultrasound images and radiofrequency (RF) data (~ 5 MHz) were collected during mechanical stimulation of the prostate using a transrectal ultrasound probe. Pre and post-compression RF data were used to construct the strain images. The Young's modulus (YM) images were subsequently reconstructed using the derived strain images and the stress distribution estimated iteratively using finite element (FE) analysis. Tumor regions determined based on the reconstructed YM images were compared to whole-mount histopathology images of radical prostatectomy specimens. Results indicated that tumors were significantly stiffer than the surrounding tissue, demonstrating a relative YM of 2. 5  ±  0. 8 compared to normal prostate tissue. The YM images had a good agreement with the histopathology images in terms of tumor location within the prostate. On average, 76 % ±  28 % of tumor regions detected based on the proposed method were inside respective tumor areas identified in the histopathology images. Results of a linear regression analysis demonstrated a good correlation between the disease extents estimated using the reconstructed YM images and those determined from whole-mount histopathology images (r 2  =  0. 71). This pilot study demonstrates that the proposed method has a good potential for detection, localization and quantification of prostate cancer. The method can potentially be used for prostate needle biopsy guidance {{with the aim of}} decreasing the number of needle biopsies. The proposed technique utilizes conventional ultrasound imaging system only while no additional <b>hardware</b> <b>attachment</b> is required for mechanical stimulation or data acquisition.

30|$|A {{key problem}} in mobile {{computing}} is providing people access to cyber-information {{associated with their}} surrounding physical objects. Mobile augmented reality {{is one of the}} emerging techniques that addresses this problem by allowing users to see the cyber-information associated with real-world physical objects by overlaying that cyber-information on the physical objects’ imagery. This paper presents a new vision-based context-aware approach for mobile augmented reality that allows users to query and access semantically-rich 3 D cyber-information related to real-world physical objects and see it precisely overlaid on top of imagery of the associated physical objects. The approach does not require any RF-based location tracking modules, external <b>hardware</b> <b>attachments</b> on the mobile devices, and/or optical/fiducial markers for localizing a user’s position. Rather, the user’s 3 D location and orientation are automatically and purely derived by comparing images from the user’s mobile device to a 3 D point cloud model generated from a set of pre-collected photographs. Our approach supports content authoring where collaboration on editing the content stored in the 3 D cloud is possible and content added by one user can be immediately accessible by others. In addition, a key challenge of scalability for mobile augmented reality is addressed in this paper. In general, mobile augmented reality is required to work regardless of users’ location and environment, in terms of physical scale, such as size of objects, and in terms of cyber-information scale, such as total number of cyber-information entities associated with physical objects. However, many existing approaches for mobile augmented reality have mainly tested their approaches on limited real-world use-cases and have challenges in scaling their approaches. By designing a multi-model based direct 2 D-to- 3 D matching algorithms for localization, as well as applying a caching scheme, the proposed research consistently supports near real-time localization and information association regardless of users’ location, size of physical objects, and number of cyber-physical information items. Empirical results presented in the paper show that the approach can provide millimeter-level augmented reality across several hundred or thousand objects without the need for additional non-imagery sensor inputs.|$|R
40|$|Impressive {{revolution}} of optical imaging and microscopy architectures has been expanding our horizon {{and increasing the}} opportunities in medical diagnostics. Although we experience significant advancements such as better resolution, speed and throughput, advanced imaging platforms are still complex, bulky and expensive, such that their function beyond well-established clinical environment is quite limited. Therefore, innovative imaging techniques are necessary to combat global health problems in resource-scarce settings where health care infrastructure is extremely limited or does not even exist. In such poor settings, imaging devices should be compact, robust, cost-effective and easy to use, without a trade-off in their performance. Centered on this vision, here I demonstrate a new lensfree on-chip microscopy and nano-particle imaging platform based on partially-coherent digital in-line holography, providing a highly-sensitive and high-throughput approach for rapid medical diagnostics and screening, especially for field settings and resource-limited environments. This computational microscopy and nano-particle imaging platform achieves subcellular spatial resolution and also directly images, {{for the first time}} in on-chip microscopy, single sub- 100 nm particles using self-assembled aspheric liquid nano-lenses around individual nano-particles across a large field-of-view of > 20 mm 2, i. e., more than two orders-of-magnitude larger than existing nano-imaging techniques. This platform does not utilize any lenses, lasers or other bulky optical/mechanical components which greatly simplifies its architecture making it portable, light-weight, and cost-effective. It has been successfully implemented on a compact stand-alone unit which weighs only ~ 46 grams with dimensions smaller than 4. 2 x 4. 2 x 5. 8 cm as well as on a commercially-available cell-phone that is modified with a light-weight (~ 38 grams) <b>hardware</b> <b>attachment.</b> Using stable and biocompatible wetting films to self-assemble aspheric liquid nano-lenses around individual nano-particles, I also introduce a wide-field on-chip microscopy modality that is capable of directly imaging single nano-particles and viruses (i. e., adenoviruses and influenza A (H 1 N 1) viral particles) within a field-portable design. Creating new opportunities for rapid medical diagnostics in point-of-care and field conditions, this lensfree microscopy and nano-particle imaging toolset may bring improved healthcare delivery especially to resource-poor regions of the world and may significantly benefit our fight against various global health challenges including HIV, malaria, waterborne diseases and viral infections...|$|R

40|$|The {{software}} industry is deemed an ideal target for {{a developing country}} to integrate into the world information and communications technology (ICT) market. On the one hand the industry is labor intensive, and the developing countries have a large labor surplus; on the other hand, it is a worldwide trend for developed countries to outsource {{a vast amount of}} low-end, software-related tasks to the low-cost countries and regions, which fits into some developing countries caliber nicely. India has often been cited as the role model for a developing country to tap into the world software market for its continuous success in the software export sector. In comparison, China's {{software industry}} is still negligible in the world despite its sustained high economic growth rate since the economic reform took off in the late 1970 s. This paper aims at examining strategies for developing China's software industry. We use India as a reference because of the similarities of the two countries' stages of economic development and the clear divergence in their ICT structures and development paths. Although the language barrier has often been singled out as the major obstacle for China's software exports, we believe the major reasons for its underdevelopment can be ascribed to the following factors. On the national level, the government attention has been skewed toward the hardware sector in the ICT industry, and there is no clear national vision for the strategic direction for the software industry. On the industry and firm level, software development has been regarded as the art of individual creativity rather than an engineering process. As a result, the importance of quality and standards, the two important critical factors in software development, have been largely neglected. Perhaps an even more fundamental factor lies in the deeply rooted notion that software is an <b>attachment</b> to the <b>hardware</b> and should be a free product. The lack of intellectual property rights protection on the government side also contributes to the low spending on software, which further hinders software firms' incentives to innovate. Extending Heeks's model of strategic positioning for developing country software enterprises, we conclude that rather than {{following in the footsteps of}} India to promote export, China should focus on its domestic software services market in the near term and pursue a more balanced development strategy in the long run. Rather than asking the question of whether China can become a major competitor like India in the world software market, we propose that there are rich opportunities for collaboration between China and world software superpowers, including India. Alliances between Chinese and foreign software firms will help both sides gain benefit from becoming cocompetitors in niche markets of mutual benefit. Cooperation with these international firms will also naturally open up foreign markets for the Chinese software firms.

The study focused on redesigning the bolted, tabbed bracket (V 10) to eliminate the bolt, reduce the number of components per bracket, eliminate the need for tools during installation, and reduce the number of small parts. Three attachment concepts were selected for evaluation through dynamic testing: (1) the key plate attachment; (2) the wire lock pin attachment; and (3) the pinned back attachment. Each attachment prototype was subjected to two vertical and two lateral dynamic component tests to evaluate the release loads and fracture mechanisms of the brackets. Test results were compared to previous tests on the bolted tabbed bracket (V 10). None of the three bracket attachment designs were found to satisfy all of the design criteria for an alternative bracket. The lack of fixity in the connection between the brackets and the post led to a variable position of the tabs within the keyway which frequently caused unsatisfactory release loads.

Specifically, this project aimed to develop and evaluate alternative attachment designs for the bolted, tabbed bracket and evaluate the use of a larger diameter, keeper rod for use in the top cable attachment. From a group of over 25 alternative attachment concepts, two tabbed bracket designs were selected for evaluation through dynamic component testing: 1) the lateral shear plate attachment and 2) the drop-in shear plate attachment. The drop-in shear plate concept did not perform as intended, as the vertical release load was too high and the lateral release loads were too low. Alternatively, the lateral shear plate design provided vertical and lateral release loads very similar to the original bolted, tabbed bracket V 10. However, concerns were raised over the lack of rigidity in the attachment and the ease of installations of the shear plate. Thus, it was recommended that the lateral shear plate design be modified and reevaluated prior to use in the full-scale system. Dynamic bogie or component testing of the 3 / 16 -in. (4. 8 -mm) diameter brass keeper rod provided a quick cable release similar to the previous design. The increased strength of the rod also showed promise in distributing impact loads more uniformly to adjacent posts and helping reduce system deflections. Thus, the 3 / 16 -in.
