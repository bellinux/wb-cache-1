A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases. In a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change {{as a result of the}} change in tax regime. Additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index <b>after</b> <b>taxation</b> is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.|$|E

40|$|In a two-period tax {{competition}} model with provision of local public goods, we analyze efficiency properties of double taxation reliefs incorporating either the exemption method, {{the tax credit}} system or the full <b>taxation</b> <b>after</b> deduction system.

We find that in case of (i) tax revenue maximization the exemption method implies inefficiently low tax rates, whereas the full <b>taxation</b> <b>after</b> deduction system leads to inefficiently low / efficient / inefficiently high tax rates. In case of (ii) welfare maximization each of these tax rules can be efficient. The (limited) tax credit system, however, is shown to always result in inefficiently low / inefficiently high tax rates. A numerical example reveals that no tax regime per se entails efficiency. In case of (i), a ranking of tax systems subject to the Pareto criterion is shown {{to depend on the}} parameters of the production function. Regarding (ii) the exemption method is preferable as it is proven to be the least inefficient tax regime. ...|$|R

5000|$|Progressive {{taxation}} has {{a direct}} effect on reducing income inequality. This is especially true if taxation is used to fund progressive government spending such as transfer payments and social safety nets. However, the effect may be muted if the higher rates cause increased tax evasion. When income inequality is low, aggregate demand will be relatively high, because more people who want ordinary consumer goods and services {{will be able to}} afford them, while the labor force will not be as relatively monopolized by the wealthy. High levels of income inequality can have negative effects on long-term economic growth, employment, and class conflict.

5000|$|Wigoder left Quadrant {{to set up}} Cellular Communications Corporation plc in March 1988, {{initially}} {{providing a}} mobile phone service to business customers through both a direct sales team and third party distributors. He recognised how consumers {{had the potential to}} transform the market, successfully positioning his company {{to take advantage of this}} opportunity by creating the [...] "Peoples Phone" [...] brand as the world's first virtual mobile network. To support this new type of customer, he established his own national High Street retail presence by opening more than 180 showrooms throughout the UK in just 12 months (a distribution model subsequently imitated by all the network operators), gaining around 10% of the UK market. Within 4 years he had built a market-leading position, having overtaken all the other independent resellers who had started several years prior to his entry into the market, including substantial multi-national companies such as Thorn-EMI, Granada, Nokia, Marconi, Philips and Motorola. The business was highly cash generative; however a decision to write off all customer acquisition costs directly against profits meant that the company reported a loss <b>after</b> <b>taxation</b> of £10.6m on turnover of £175m for the financial year ended 31 October 1995. Following a disagreement between the major shareholders on the future strategy for the company, it was acquired by Vodafone in November 1996 for £77m; however Wigoder only collected £6.5M from the deal, as most of the company was owned by venture capital investors. Vodafone followed this deal with further acquisitions within the sector (namely Astec and Talkland in December 1996) giving it greater control over the customers using its network. According to Vodafone's 1997 annual report and accounts, Peoples Phone made £4.1m in the period to end of 1996.|$|E

The focus of this paper is on the aspects of bounded rationality (habitual behavior, incomplete information) and the interaction between actors. An application of system dynamics modeling is explored to investigate the process of information acquisition about the alternatives by air travelers and the transfer of this information. The model includes the airports of Eindhoven, Niederrhein and Charleroi and uses a multinomial logit function to determine market shares. Preliminary results show that a structural change has occurred in the level of awareness of Niederrhein airport <b>after</b> the <b>taxation.</b> Policy AnalysisTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|R
