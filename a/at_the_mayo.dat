5|$|Medical residencies {{traditionally}} require lengthy {{hours of}} their trainees. Residents {{in the past}} had literally resided in hospitals {{for the duration of}} their training. By 2010, when the case was argued before the Supreme Court, regulations from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and the American Osteopathic Association had limited work hours to about 80 hours per week, and a first-year resident <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> Clinic made $47,259 plus benefits.|$|E

5|$|After several {{case reports}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{periodic}} paralysis was first described in full by the German neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890) in 1885. In 1926 the Japanese physician Tetsushiro Shinosaki, from Fukuoka, observed {{the high rate of}} thyroid disease in Japanese people with periodic paralysis. The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> Clinic; they described the condition in a patient with features of Graves' disease. In 1937 periodic paralysis was linked with hypokalemia, as well as precipitation of attacks with glucose and insulin. This phenomenon {{has been used as a}} diagnostic test.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{and colleagues}} from St Thomas' Hospital, London, {{were the first}} to mention a case with {{possible}} clinical findings of LEMS in 1953, but Lambert, Eaton, and Rooke <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> Clinic were the first physicians to substantially describe the clinical and electrophysiological findings of the disease in 1956. In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity. Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Madison School in San Francisco from 1918 to 1924, {{and then}} San Francisco Polytechnic High School. In 1926, his father became a researcher <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> Clinic, {{and the family}} moved to Rochester, Minnesota, where Alvarez attended Rochester High School. He had always expected to attend the University of California, but at the urging of his teachers at Rochester, he instead went to the University of Chicago, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1932, his master's degree in 1934, and his PhD in 1936. As an undergraduate, he belonged to the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. As a postgraduate he moved to Gamma Alpha.|$|E

5|$|Murphy {{developed}} his eponymous anastomotic button for a sutureless anastomosis of the gallbladder to the duodenum (his preferred treatment for acute cholecystitis), {{but it was}} equally suitable for intestinal anastomoses. He developed it in the experimental animal laboratory in a barn behind his house and first used it {{less than a week}} after developing it on a dog. The Murphy button can be credited as the forerunner of the modern end-to-end stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> Clinic and elsewhere in the United States for over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{would often}} spend {{weekends}} {{with his parents}} in Saskatoon. While there, he began to woo Olive Freeman, daughter of the Baptist minister, but in 1921, she moved with her family to Brandon, Manitoba, and the two lost touch for more than 20 years. He then courted Beth Newell, a cashier in Saskatoon, and by 1922, the two were engaged. However, in 1923, Newell was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and Diefenbaker broke off contact with her. She died the following year. Diefenbaker was himself subject to internal bleeding, and may have feared that the disease would be transmitted to him. In late 1923, he had an operation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> Clinic for a gastric ulcer, but his health remained uncertain for several more years.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Rollin Woodyatt {{reviewed}} {{the research on}} diet and diabetes. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone (known collectively as ketone bodies), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Russel Wilder, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> Clinic, built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet that produced {{a high level of}} ketone bodies in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Wilkinson's wife, Martha, {{announced}} that she would seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1991. The move was widely seen as a surrogate candidacy so that her husband could continue his administration for a second consecutive term. Her challengers included Lieutenant Governor Jones, Lexington mayor Scotty Baesler, and Dr. Floyd G. Poore, the former Kentucky highway director. With polls consistently showing little support for her candidacy, Mrs. Wilkinson {{dropped out of the}} race in May 1991. Earlier in the year, Wallace Wilkinson was diagnosed with limited-stage Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This diagnosis was also a factor in Ms. Wilkinson's withdrawal from the race. Wallace underwent surgery <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, then received radiation therapy at the University of Kentucky. These treatments eliminated all signs of the disease by 1993, and doctors gave Wilkinson an excellent chance of recovery.|$|E
5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer {{that he can not}} sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told {{the only way he could}} buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E

On August 28, Ford was released from the hospital and returned with his wife Betty to their California home. On October 13, he was scheduled to attend the dedication of a building of his namesake, the Gerald R.

The previous day, Ford had entered the Eisenhower Medical Center for undisclosed tests; he was released on October 16. By November 2006, he was confined to a bed in his study.|$|E

25|$|Gehrig flew {{alone to}} Rochester from Chicago, where the Yankees were {{playing at the}} time, and arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> Clinic on June 13, 1939.

Eleanor Gehrig was told that the cause of ALS was unknown but it was painless, non-contagious, and cruel—the motor function of the central nervous system is destroyed, but the mind remains fully aware to the end.|$|E
