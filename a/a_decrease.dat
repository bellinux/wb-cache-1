5|$|In the 1990s, after Estonia regained independence, {{the country}} {{underwent}} a {{restructuring of the}} economy, causing {{the collapse of a}} large part of the heavy industry sector. This collapse led to <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> in the consumption of electricity and thus <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> in the need for the oil shale that was mined to produce it. Electricity and shale oil export to former Soviet markets largely ceased. Due to <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> in demand, the Tammiku and Sompa mines closed in 1999 and those at Kohtla and Ahtme closed in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> {{in the cost of}} using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, <b>a</b> <b>decrease</b> in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E

The carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM 1) is an important candidate for causing insulin resistance. Methods The CEACAM 1 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in the liver tissues of 99 severely obese or non-obese subjects with or without diabetes. The CEACAM 1 expression was classified into two categories: a normal expression or <b>a</b> <b>decreased</b> expression. Results The CEACAM 1 expression was markedly decreased in the hepatocytes with macrovesicular steatosis. <b>A</b> <b>decreased</b> CEACAM 1 expression was noted in 29 (29 %) of 99 cases. The incidence of <b>a</b> <b>decreased</b> CEACAM 1 expression was significantly higher in high grade fatty liver as well as severe obesity with or without diabetes (p Conclusions This data supports that <b>a</b> <b>decreased</b> CEACAM 1 expression is related to obesity and a fatty liver. </p...|$|R
