5|$|The 2nd Army Group was {{commanded}} by Armijski đeneral Milutin Nedić, {{and consisted of}} the 1st Army, {{commanded by}} Armijski đeneral Milan Rađenković, and the 2nd Army, commanded by Armijski đeneral Dragoslav Miljković. The 1st Army consisted of one infantry division, one horsed cavalry division, and two brigade-strength infantry detachments, and was supported by artillery, <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery,</b> and air reconnaissance elements of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force. The 2nd Army consisted of three infantry divisions and one horsed cavalry regiment, supported by artillery, <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery</b> and border guards, with air reconnaissance support. The 2nd Army Group did not control any additional support units, and had several units with {{a significant proportion of}} Croat soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The North Vietnamese also {{responded to}} the American aerial threat by the {{increased}} use of heavy concentrations of <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery.</b> By 1968 this was mainly composed of 37mm and 57mm radar-controlled weapons. The next year, 85mm and 100mm guns appeared, {{and by the end of}} Commando Hunt, over 1,500 guns defended the system.|$|E
5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only correct {{for the effects of}} the wind in a simple way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise the complexity of the required calculations. This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery</b> to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the war was}} {{entering}} its final stages, the squadron still had to watch for <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery.</b> The fighter squadrons continued to make advances until February, {{while waiting for the}} Canadian push through the Reichwald. Although there was some aerial fighting, the major conflict with the Luftwaffe occurred when the Canadians started to cross the Rhine on 24 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April, the JNA {{established}} a buffer zone {{to separate the}} belligerents at Plitvice Lakes, deploying elements of the 1st and the 5th Military Districts. Those were an armoured battalion of the 329th Armoured Brigade based in Banja Luka, a battalion of the 6th Mountain Brigade based in Delnice, a reconnaissance company and a mechanised battalion of the 4th Armoured Brigade based in Jastrebarsko and Karlovac, a battalion of the 306th Light <b>Anti-Aircraft</b> <b>Artillery</b> Regiment based in Zagreb, a signals company of the 367th Signals Regiment based in Samobor, a company of the 13th Military Police Battalion based in Rijeka and an <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery</b> battery drawn from the 13th Proletarian Motorised Brigade based in Rijeka. Finally, the 5th Military District set up a forward command post at the Plitvice Lakes. The JNA force at the Plitvice Lakes was commanded by Colonel Ivan Štimac.|$|E
5|$|The Z-8 Geier was not produced. It was {{intended}} as a ground attack aircraft and reached the first planning phase but was given up due to lack of performance and protective armour allocation against <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery.</b> An increase in armour would have meant a decrease in speed which would have exposed the aircraft further to enemy fire.|$|E

25|$|There was no {{air defense}} at Elvenes until 1943. A {{shift in the}} war caused the German {{military}} to become more concerned with an Allied air attack on Troms and two <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artilleries</b> were installed. Work on hardened aircraft shelters were also started. At {{the end of the}} war armored troops were deployed to defend the airport from a land attack.|$|R
5|$|The sensors were {{delivered}} to the target areas by U.S. Navy OP-2 Neptunes of VO-67 or by U.S. Air Force helicopters, both based at Nakhon Phanom. Due to increasing PAVN <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery</b> defences encountered in southeastern Laos, delivery in high-risk areas of the trail system was handed over from the Neptunes to Air Force F-4 Phantom II fighter-bombers that had been specially equipped for the missions.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of the Belgian Army's mobilisation, it could muster five Regular Corps and two reserve Army Corps consisting of 12 regular infantry divisions, two divisions of Chasseurs Ardennais, six reserve infantry divisions, one brigade of Cyclist Frontier Guards, one Cavalry Corps of two divisions, and one brigade of motorised cavalry. The Army contained two <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery</b> and four artillery regiments, and an unknown number of fortress, engineer, and signals force personnel.|$|E
5|$|At 09:12, JG 2 {{crossed the}} front line at Malmedy and was greeted by an {{enormous}} volume of Allied ground fire. The entire area was heavily defended by <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery,</b> since the area had been the scene of heavy fighting, but also had been attacked by V-1 and V-2 missiles. I./JG 2 lost at least seven fighters to ground fire alone. III./JG 2 lost 10 fighters. A possible seven Bf 109s from II./JG 2 were also lost to ground fire. JG 2 attacked Asch and Ophoven airfields by mistake.|$|E

5|$|At 16:29, the Japanese dive bombers {{began their}} attacks. Although several {{attempted}} {{to set up}} to attack the Saratoga, they quickly shifted back to the nearer carrier, Enterprise. Thus, Enterprise {{was the target of}} almost the entire Japanese air attack. Several Wildcats followed the Vals into their attack dives, despite the intense <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery</b> fire from Enterprise and her screening warships, {{in a desperate attempt to}} disrupt their attacks. As many as four Wildcats were shot down by U.S. anti-aircraft fire, as well as several Vals.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Air Force {{had already}} begun to up the ante in its anti-infiltration campaigns by unleashing B-52 Stratofortress bombers against the trail in December 1965. From April through June 1966 there were 400 B-52 anti-infiltration sorties against the system. The PAVN countered this effort by concentrating more <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery</b> weapons within its {{logistical}} network. Between 1964 and the end of 1967 there were 103,148 tactical air sorties launched against the trail, including 1,718 B-52 strikes. During the same timeframe 132 U.S. aircraft or helicopters were shot down over Laos.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the Air Force was {{tasked with}} {{gathering}} intelligence, air reconnaissance, and air transport. Support of ground troops, both doctrinally {{and as a}} practical matter, became marginal. These missions were strongly influenced by a shrinking capability, since its combat aircraft could operate by daylight only, its <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery</b> was obsolete, and the FLORIDA radar system had reached the limits of operational effectiveness. The retirement of the Hawker Hunters in 1994ended its ground support capability, and a cut of one-third from the defence budget meant that plans for a second purchase of F/A-18s and supporting air-to-ground weapons (the reason the multi-capable Hornet was selected) had to be canceled, leaving both it and the F-5s in a strictly air-to-air role.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} apparent to U.S. planners that, {{in a military}} confrontation with Warsaw Pact forces, NATO aircraft would quickly suffer heavy losses. This came {{as a result of}} sophisticated Soviet defense networks, which used surveillance radars and radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery</b> to seek and eliminate enemy aircraft. Consequently, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) started a study on low-observability aircraft, seeking to design and produce an operational stealth aircraft. Five companies were initially invited, three of which bowed out early. The remaining two were later joined by Lockheed.|$|E
5|$|The Army and Air Force {{had been}} {{involved}} in interservice fighting over missile systems since they split in 1947. The Army considered surface-to-surface missiles (SSM) an extension of conventional artillery, and surface-to-air designs as the modern replacement for their <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery.</b> The Air Force considered the nuclear SSM to be an extension of their strategic bombing role, and any sort of long-range anti-aircraft system to be their domain as it would integrate with their fighter fleet. Both forces were developing missiles for both roles, leading to considerable duplication of effort which was widely seen as wasteful.|$|E
5|$|The B-70 {{was planned}} to use a high-speed, high-altitude bombing {{approach}} that followed a trend of bombers flying progressively faster and higher {{since the start of}} manned bomber use. Through that same period, only two weapons proved effective against bombers: fighter aircraft and <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery</b> (AAA). Flying higher and faster made it more difficult for both; higher speeds allowed the bomber to fly out of range of the weapons more quickly, while higher altitudes increased the time needed for fighters to climb to the bombers, and greatly increased the size of the AAA weapons needed to reach those altitudes.|$|E

5|$|The Kaštela TG {{started to}} {{withdraw}} east at approximately 8:00a.m., fearing the shortest available route to Vis might be mined {{in the area}} of Split Entrance. It reached the eastern tip of Brač by 8:30a.m. At 9:28a.m., three Yugoslav Air Force J-21 Jastrebs flew low over Brač and Šolta; minutes later, two were reportedly shot down by <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery.</b> Six Yugoslav jets were sortied against targets on Brač and Šolta. Following the naval action that morning, Croatian civilian boats from Šolta towed the partially submerged Mukos to Nečujam Bay and ran it aground there. In the afternoon, the Kaštela TG and the Ploče TG linked up east of the island of Hvar.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanized}} divisions {{were organized}} along the Soviet model with three mechanized infantry regiments, one tank regiment, {{and a full}} complement of 12,000 infantry soldiers, while the armored divisions were composed of 3 tank and one mechanized infantry regiment plus support units. The artillery, antitank, and air defence regiments of divisions provided specialised fire support that enabled motorised rifle and tank regiments to maneuver. The air defense regiments consisted of two <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery</b> battalions and one surface-to-air missile (SAM) battalion, each composed of several batteries. In the late 1980s the artillery regiments of mechanized and tank divisions included two artillery battalions, one multiple rocket launcher battalion, and one surface-to-surface missile battalion.|$|E
5|$|The method {{chosen by}} PAVN {{to defeat the}} {{invasion}} was to first isolate the northern firebases by utilizing <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>artillery.</b> The outposts would then be pounded by round-the-clock mortar, artillery, and rocket fire. Although the ARVN firebases were themselves equipped with artillery, their guns were quickly outranged by PAVN's Soviet-supplied 122mm and 130mm pieces, which simply stood off and pounded the positions at will. The defensive edge {{that could have been}} provided by the utilization of tactical B-52 bomber strikes was nullified by the close-in tactics of the communist forces. Massed ground attacks, supported by artillery and armor would then finish the job.|$|E
