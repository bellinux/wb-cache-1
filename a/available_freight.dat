50|$|The {{main purpose}} of a freight {{exchange}} is to fill empty vehicles on their return journeys (when they {{are on their way}} back to their depot after a delivery) by matching them to <b>available</b> <b>freight.</b> For example, a trucker has an order to transport tulips from Keukenhof in the Netherlands to Como, Italy. Ideally, a freight order for the return trip would increase profitability, so the trucker would search for return freight or return load on a freight exchange.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the goods volume to Zermatt is transported in standard containers, for which bogie and four wheel carrying wagons are <b>available.</b> <b>Freight</b> not transported in containers is loaded at Visp into sliding wall box cars, and later delivered to recipients in Zermatt by electric road vehicles. For non moisture sensitive goods, many open wagons of various types can be used. Oil transport is undertaken in tank cars with either four wheels or bogies. Classic covered wagons play no role in normal traffic any more. During the high season, up to three purely goods trains operate daily in each direction, and goods wagons are also attached to some passenger trains.|$|E
50|$|A freight {{exchange}} is an online service for haulage companies, logistics providers, freight forwarders and transport companies. It allows haulage companies to search {{a database of}} <b>available</b> <b>freight</b> {{that needs to be}} delivered and advertise their available vehicle capacity. Logistics providers and freight forwarders can advertise their freight loads that needs delivering as well as match their freight loads to the available vehicle capacity.These systems provide a platform that allows carriers to communicate freight traffic information to fellow operators such as transporters, forwarders and logistics companies. They allow forwarders to advertise their freight either privately or publicly to a large number of freight operators that are looking for loads. They also allow freight operators to offer vehicle space. Online systems are normally subscription-based with a small charge for advertising (posting) and searching (consulting).|$|E

Management coordination of meat shipment led to concentration in shipping. Only liner companies could provide specialized ships with the regularity needed and they dominated North Atlantic shipping. The cargo capacity of cattle ships, beyond that used for animals, lowered freight rates on grain below levels that would otherwise have prevailed.

40|$|Mode {{choice is}} {{important}} in shipping commodities efficiently. This paper develops a binary logit model and a regres-sion model to study the cereal grains movement by truck and rail in the United States using the publically <b>available</b> <b>Freight</b> Analysis Framework (FAF 2. 2) database and US highway and networks and TransCAD, a geographic informa-tion system with strong transportation modeling capabilities. The binary logit model and the regression model both use {{the same set of}} generic variables, including mode split probability, commodity weight, value, network travel time, and fuel cost. The results show that both the binary logit and regression models perform well for cereal grains transportation in the United States, with the binary logit model yielding overall better estimates with respect to the observed truck and rail mode splits. The two models can be used to study other commodities between two modes and may produce better results if more mode specific variables are used...|$|E
40|$|Despite Swedens large biomass {{resources}} and well-established industry using the resource, Sweden today imports biofuels {{to meet the}} demand for biomass energy. There are several incentives stimulating a continued Swedish bioenergy expansion. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the prospects for large-scale import of biomass and biofuels to Sweden, for the supply of alternative transportation fuels. The aim is to illuminate relevant aspects to consider. Based on a literature review and own investigations, we conclude that transportation energy requirements and environmental aspects seem not to present any obstacles to large-scale import of biomass from far away regions. Cost aspects seem more uncertain, and depend on several factors, such as biomass type transported, handling costs and competition for <b>available</b> <b>freight</b> and port capacity. Liquid biofuels fit well within present liquid fuel transportation infrastructure. On the other hand, a strategy involving large scale import of biomass as feedstock for domestic biofuel production may have to handle bottlenecks linked to specialization of ports in certain trade flows and the infrastructure linked to the ports. However, a closer examination of relevant aspects is required before any firm conclusion regarding the prospects for large scale biomass and biofuels import to Sweden can be made...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a study concerning {{the feasibility of}} fast freight services on high speed lines, which have been so far utilised for passenger traffic only, though designed also for heavy freight trains. The influence of possible significant speed improvements of freight rolling stock is taken into account, considering {{a part of the}} Italian high speed-high capacity network as a case study, the Milano-Bologna line. A timetable-based approach is followed, making use of a dedicated analysis methodology. The analysis relies on a routing-scheduling algorithm (embedded in a railway capacity analysis tool) used for identifying available time slots for inserting additional freight paths. Overtakings are scheduled where needed, without altering the passenger timetable. 16 scenarios are analysed, they are different for which regards the top speed of the freight trains and the locations where the latter can enter/exit the analysed network. The possibility of scheduling overtakings "whilst in motion" is examined as well. The scenarios are analysed considering as indicators the daily number of <b>available</b> <b>freight</b> paths, their distribution along the day and their quality, i. e. the amount of extra dwell time in intermediate stations due to possible overtakings. The robustness of the extra freight paths is then assessed, in order to check their actual feasibility in case of common perturbations of the passenger traffic. Results obtained are then discussed, highlighting how the heterogeneity of the traffic significantly reduces the residual capacit...|$|E
40|$|The {{transnational}} {{research programme}} “Call 2014 : Mobility and ITS” was {{launched by the}} Conference of European Directors of Roads (CEDR). Funded within that program, Mobility as a Service for Linking Europe (MAASiFiE) is a two-year project that investigates the prerequisites for organizing user-oriented and ecological mobility services {{in order to provide}} consumers with flexible, efficient and user-friendly services covering multiple modes of transport on a one-stop-shop principle. Megatrends like changing demographics in terms of population growth, ageing of population, new population requirements of millennials, and ICT technology transformation, play a major role enabling the evolvement of new mobility services. Mobility service concepts are changing in the direction of combining and implementing new business models, enabling the development of innovative services and products in mobility markets. With this respect, Deliverable 3 as part of Work Package (WP) 3 of the MAASiFiE project concentrates on the identification of new business and operator models providing an insight into the new transport paradigm of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS). Based on a state-of-the-art survey covering interviews with experts, an online questionnaire, case examples of MaaS services and a literature review, a more thorough understanding of how transport-related stakeholders perceive and interact with the topic of MaaS is gained. Thus, an elaboration of responsibilities/roles, business models, related value chains and operator models in the context of MaaS is enabled and results are provided in this document. As a common point of reference, the consortium has agreed upon the following definition of MaaS: Multimodal and sustainable mobility services addressing customers' transport needs by integrating planning and payment on a one-stop-shop principle. Mobility services are expected to increase the use of public transport and ride sharing and to provide the means for rationalising passenger transport and wherever possible freight transport as well as identified by the state-of. the-art survey within Deliverable 3. In addition, <b>available</b> <b>freight</b> transport and logistic operations are analysed wherever similar characteristics to MaaS-related passenger applications are identified. Overall, the state-of-the-art survey results focusing on international MaaS concepts have shown that there currently exist various smaller MaaS-pilots covering different geographical service areas, including for instance city, rural and/or regional areas. Very few larger MaaS services have been established with a wider geographical coverage, including national and international service coverage. Based on different MaaS service areas, different aims and requirements for implementing MaaS concepts arise. While for instance, urban areas focus largely on the reduction of private car usage, congestion and transport-related emissions, rural areas aim at promoting higher efficiency and utilization rates by emphasizing demand driven transport services. National and international MaaS services focus rather on providing combined all-in-one packages including for instance long-haul transport, accommodation, event and booking services. Identified value chains of MaaS services illustrate changes of roles and responsibilities in the organisation of transport of people and goods. In this respect, changes in value networks and related organisational requirements are derived and applied to show different combinations of MaaS services. Basically four MaaS operator models were identified: Reseller, Integrator, Public transport operator and PPP models. Based on service combination characteristics, it could be concluded that the commercial Reseller model may best fit travel agencies and therefore national and international traveling. The Public transport (PT) operator model could be mainly used in cities, where comprehensive PT already exists. The PPP model may be preferred for rural areas, as public actors have an interest in increasing efficiency of subsidized transportation. The commercial Integrator model would probably fit well in both urban and suburban areas and national/international MaaS; thus it could be considered the most versatile and flexible model. However, as MaaS is continuously developing, and can be implemented in various ways, the presented models and categorizations should be read and interpreted as a current understanding of an emerging phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|Input {{congestion}} {{very likely}} existed in rail transport. However, early works measuring the rail transport efficiencies rarely took the input congestion into account; hence, the proposed strategies for enhancing efficiencies can be misleading.
