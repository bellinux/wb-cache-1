Set in a dorm of the formerly all-female Baxter College, the pilot of Co-Ed Fever was aired by CBS on February 4, 1979, but the network canceled the series before airing any more episodes. NBC also had its Animal House-inspired sitcom, Brothers <b>and</b> <b>Sisters,</b> <b>in</b> which three members of Crandall College's Pi Nu fraternity interact with members of the Gamma Iota sorority. Like ABC's Delta House, Brothers and Sisters lasted only three months.|$|E

25|$|Already well-connected to {{a wealthy}} family and now well-educated in business, {{he built a}} {{personal}} fortune of 500,000 by 1899.

As the eldest sibling, Francisco exercised authority over his younger brothers <b>and</b> <b>sisters.</b> <b>In</b> January 1903, he married Sara Pérez, first in a civil ceremony, and then a Catholic nuptial mass celebrated by the archbishop. From all accounts it was a happy marriage, but they had no children.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} consequences of the Secular Franciscan charism is that the spiritual formation of the OFS must cater for those whose vocation is, motivated by the dynamic power of the Gospel, to live in secular circumstances.

Therefore, Secular Franciscans should seek to encounter the living and active person of Christ in their brothers <b>and</b> <b>sisters,</b> <b>in</b> Sacred Scripture, in the Church and in liturgical activity. They do this by studying, loving and most of all by living in an integrated way the human and evangelical aspects of their life.|$|E
