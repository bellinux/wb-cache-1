5|$|Fragment of a Crucifixion is a 1950 canvas by the Irish-born, English figurative painter Francis Bacon, {{housed in}} the Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven. The {{painting}} shows two animals engaged in brutal struggle. The upper figure, which may be <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> a cat, crouches over a chimera and is {{at the point of}} kill. It stoops on the horizontal beam of a T-shaped structure, which may signify Christ's cross. The painting contains thinly sketched passer-by figures, who seem oblivious to the central drama.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} vampiric {{generation}} were many and varied in original folklore. In Slavic and Chinese traditions, any corpse that was jumped over by an animal, particularly <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> a cat, was feared {{to become one}} of the undead. A body with a wound that had not been treated with boiling water was also at risk. In Russian folklore, vampires were said to have once been witches or people who had rebelled against the Russian Orthodox Church while they were alive.|$|E
5|$|Other regular {{characters}} include Fenton Fuscus, a bat {{who went}} to high school and university with Lindesfarne, to whom he is now married and have a hedgehog-bat hybrid daughter, Turvy; Fiona Fennec, a half-red, half-Fennec fox vixen who is Rudy's girlfriend; George Fennec, Fiona's father who is married to Danielle, a sister of Kevin, and have a human son, Francis (the first of its kind in this world)since Danielle herself was human once; and Ralph Dewclaw, Kell's brother who was originally hostile to Kevin, but now accepts the rabbit as family after several unsuccessful hunting attempts. He now works for Kevin as part of Hare-Link and is married to George's former wife Martha. Another is Daisy, a daisy plant made intelligent by the GBC. It lives with the Dewclaws as a pet, having the same intelligence as <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> cat in our world.|$|E

5|$|The upper {{creature}} may be <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> a cat. Blood {{pours out}} of its mouth onto the head and body of its prey, a chimera rendered as owl-like with human facial characteristics. The prey unsuccessfully struggles to flee from its captor. The lower figure's human aspect is most notable {{in the details of}} its mouth and genitalia. Both figures are positioned in the centre foreground of the canvas, and are each mutilated and covered in blood, their physical discomfort contrasted against the flat, neutral background typical of Bacon's paintings. The figures exhibit many elements found in his early work, noticeably the expressive broad strokes set against the tightness of the flat, nondescript background. The link with the biblical Crucifixion is made through the raised arms of the lower creature, and the T-shaped cross.|$|E

25|$|Once the {{intermediate}} host is eaten by the definitive host such as <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> human, the parasite undergoes sexual reproduction within the gut to create macrogamonts and microgamonts. Most definitive hosts {{do not show}} any clinical sign or symptoms. Fusion of a macrogamont and a microgamont creates a zygote which develops into an oocyst. The oocyst is passed through the faeces completing the life cycle.|$|E

25|$|Animal-assisted therapy, {{where an}} animal such as <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> a horse becomes a basic {{part of a}} person's treatment, is a {{controversial}} treatment for some symptoms. A 2007 meta-analysis found that animal-assisted therapy {{is associated with a}} moderate improvement in autism spectrum symptoms. Reviews of published dolphin-assisted therapy (DAT) studies have found important methodological flaws and have concluded that there is no compelling scientific evidence that DAT is a legitimate therapy or that it affords any more than fleeting improvements in mood.|$|E

25|$|Although {{children}} perceive {{rhythmic patterns}} {{in their native}} language at 7–8 months, they {{are not able to}} reliably distinguish compound words and phrases that differ only in stress placement, such as ‘HOT dog’ vs. ‘hot DOG’ until around 12 years of age. Children in a study by Vogel and Raimy (2002) were asked to show which of two pictures (i.e., <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> a sausage) was being named. Children younger than 12 years generally preferred the compound reading (i.e., the sausage) to the phrasal reading (the dog). The authors concluded from this that children start out with a lexical bias, i.e., they prefer to interpret phrases like these as single words, and the ability to override this bias develops until late in childhood.|$|E
25|$|Dogs {{of similar}} type {{are seen in}} very old European paintings, though the Westphalian Dachsbracke was first {{described}} as a variety of German Hound in 1886. It was recognized by the Verband für das Deutsche Hundewesen (German Kennel Club) in 1935 with its current name, and by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale as breed number 100 in Group 6 (scenthounds), Section 1.3 (small hounds). The Westphalian Dachsbracke is the ancestor breed of the Swedish scenthound, the Drever. Of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, only the United Kennel Club in the US recognises the Westphalian Dachsbracke, in its scenthound group. The Westphalian Dachsbracke also may be recognised {{by any of the}} many minor registries, rare breed groups, hunting clubs, and internet dog registry businesses under its original name or variations on the name. Hunting use of the Westphalian Dachsbracke has been mostly supplanted by the Drever, and the Westphalian Dachsbracke is seldom seen even in its home country; purchasers of dogs represented as Westphalian Dachsbracke should research the dog's background, especially if it is registered with one of the minor clubs that require little to no documentation before accepting <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> litter for registration.|$|E

Ten checkpoints and four dog drops, some more than [...] apart, lie along the trail. Veterinarians are present at each to ensure the health and welfare of the dogs, give advice, and provide veterinary care for dropped dogs; together with the race marshal or a race judge, they may remove <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> team from the race for medical or other reasons.|$|E

500|$|Egyptian {{writings}} {{describe the}} gods' bodies in detail. They {{are made of}} precious materials; their flesh is gold, their bones are silver, and their hair is lapis lazuli. They give off a scent that the Egyptians likened to the incense used in rituals. Some texts give precise descriptions of particular deities, including their height and eye color. Yet these characteristics are not fixed; in myths, gods change their appearances to suit their own purposes. Egyptian texts often refer to deities' true, underlying forms as [...] "mysterious". The Egyptians' visual representations of their gods are therefore not literal. They symbolize specific aspects of each deity's character, functioning much like the ideograms in hieroglyphic writing. For this reason, the funerary god Anubis is commonly shown in Egyptian art as <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> jackal, a creature whose scavenging habits threaten the preservation of buried mummies, {{in an effort to}} counter this threat and employ it for protection. His black coloring alludes to the color of mummified flesh and to the fertile black soil that Egyptians saw as a symbol of resurrection.|$|E
500|$|The {{last bit}} of news {{yesterday}} morning is the King's anger against Eliza Wednesday (yesterday) night for being impudent to him. He threw a chair at her head and a spitoon also, which made a great cut {{on the side of}} her head. The nearest Doctor was sent for [...] both McGrew and McKibbin arrived. It seems the King told her to come to bed — she replied what right has <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> a bitch there, which instantly gave vent to his ill temper that he had been brooding some days, and used a word of four letters belonging only to Waterclosets. She retorted, [...] "Oh, I suppose that is what you eat to exist on." [...] This brought the King's rage to an instant climax and [...] threw the articles at her head. I had intended to call yesterday to see how he continues to improve, but this domestic fracas of the Royal household puts it out of the question, till a few days more when the King will be settled and not so upset.|$|E
500|$|Frederick {{wrote to}} Elgin in January 1895 that Karim was deeply unpopular in the Household, {{and that he}} {{occupied}} [...] "very much {{the same position as}} John Brown used to". Princesses Louise and Beatrice, Prince Henry of Battenberg, Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, and Secretary of State for India Henry Fowler had all raised concerns about Karim with the Queen, who [...] "refused to listen to {{what they had to say}} but was very angry, so as you see the Munshi is a sort of pet, like <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> cat which the Queen will not willingly give up". Elgin was warned by both Ponsonby and the India Office that the Queen gave his letters to the Munshi to read, and that consequently his correspondence to her should not be of a confidential nature. Victoria's advisors feared Karim's association with Rafiuddin Ahmed, an Indian political activist resident in London who was connected to the Muslim Patriotic League. They suspected that Ahmed extracted confidential information from Karim to pass onto the Amir of Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman Khan. There is no indication that these fears were well-founded, or that the Munshi was ever indiscreet.|$|E

Convinced {{he is a great}} writer, Brian attempts to gain the family's interest but fails to do so. Once he arrives at the [...] "award ceremony" [...] however, he discovers that he has misunderstood {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "special", [...] prompting him to drown his sorrows at the local bar and realize that he's not a writer at all, but a big fat joke. He drives home drunk that night and accidentally runs over and kills a dog. He secretly buries the dead dog's body outside the Griffins' home and tries to keep quiet about it. Stewie, having witnessed his deed, begins to toy with Brian's guilt, eventually driving him to a state where he decides to confess to [...] "murder".

500|$|The {{adaptation}} received mostly negative {{reviews from}} the press, believing {{it did not}} match up to Hitchcock's 1935 film version (as predicted by Mickery). Sam Wollaston of The Guardian felt that the romance scene between Hannay and Victoria (when they stay overnight in an inn) was [...] "one of the silliest ever" [...] and felt that after the final scene at the loch and the concluding scene: [...] "It's all very silly.... It doesn't have the pace, the moodiness or the wit." [...] Damien Love of Sunday Herald felt the [...] "tepid pace" [...] was set by the casting of Penry-Jones, and that he [...] "has a style reminiscent of the young Roger Moore, but without the vital, animating spark of self-deprecation. As Hannay, Penry-Jones is not at his best, and more reminiscent of a well-stuffed armchair on wheels." [...] Mick Hume of The Times said [...] "The overall effect was to turn Buchan's blood and thunder tale into a pallid politically correct Enid Blyton story", and The Independents Robert Hanks concluded his review by saying that [...] "By the end, my impression was that several pages of the plot must have been eaten by <b>a</b> <b>dog,</b> <b>or</b> a bored actor, and the director had decided, sod it, nobody's going to keep watching this long. Which I wouldn't have if I wasn't being paid." ...|$|E
500|$|To mix the tracks, a Sony Oxford Console was used. Audio {{engineer}} Mick Guzauski {{explained to}} SoundByte {{that he used}} the console's [...] "Automated EQ feature" [...] on the tracks. He {{said that he could}} [...] "tailor the frequency responses and dynamics within each song with optimum equalizer at every pitch and level." [...] For the Afanasieff tracks, the background vocals and overdubs were accomplished on the Oxford console at his Wally World StudioB, at San Rafael, California. Simpson's label-mate and Latin singer Marc Anthony is featured as a guest vocalist on the ballad [...] "There You Were". Simpson met Anthony at the taping of the TV special A Christmas in Washington in 2000. They talked to each other, and proposed recording a song on both of their next albums. They sang the song {{side by side in the}} studio and the whole song was completed within six hours. [...] "Forever in Your Eyes" [...] was one of the first songs to be recorded for the album, and was produced by Rhett Lawrence. It was recorded at Sony Music Studios within two hours. Rodney Jerkins, who was acquainted with Mottola, produced two cuts on Irresistible. In an interview with Sony Music Japan, Simpson said that she never met Jerkins in person. He produced and recorded the songs' music and sent the tape to Columbia, from which [...] "Imagination" [...] and [...] "I Never" [...] were selected. Cory Rooney produced Simpson's vocals and Tony Maserati mixed the vocals. Initially, Simpson did not want to record [...] "What's It Gonna Be" [...] as she felt the line [...] "Are you gonna be <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> a gentleman" [...] was a little awkward. However, due to her record label's persuasion, she recorded the song and ultimately became fond of it. In order to record the title track, Simpson traveled to Murlyn Music Studios, in Sweden. [...] "A Little Bit" [...] was produced by Ric Wake; although he produced many songs for the album, only [...] "A Little Bit" [...] made the final cut. The Japanese version of the album contains a bonus track—the Hex Hector remix of [...] "Irresistible"—for which Simpson re-recorded her vocals.|$|E
