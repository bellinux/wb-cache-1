50|$|The New Port of Buenos Aires was {{completed}} in 1926, making the existing Madero docks superfluous. Though these continued to serve in <b>ancillary</b> <b>port</b> functions, the zone gradually decayed, {{becoming one of the}} city's most degraded areas, a mixture of warehouses and large tracts of undeveloped land. In 1925, 1940, 1960, 1969, 1971, 1981 and 1985, successive proposals were put forth with the intent of urbanizing the old port, or to demolish it outright; none of these plans came to fruition, however.|$|E

30|$|Trocar {{placement}} {{is critical}} for proper performance of surgery. A panoramic view of the operating area is necessary for two important parts of surgery: intracorporeal suturing and safe morcellation of the enucleated myomas. The laparoscope is generally introduced through the umbilical port. In a patient with a large uterus, it may be introduced through a midline incision cephalad to the umbilicus. The <b>ancillary</b> <b>ports</b> are usually 5  mm, {{and one of them}} is enlarged to 12 / 15  mm to introduce the morcellator.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, SILS (single {{incision}} laparoscopic surgery) is being utilized increasingly in various procedures; single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) {{is the most common}} one of these procedures [1, 2]. One of the fundamental step in laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to visualize Calot's triangle to obtain the critical view described by Strasberg et al. 1995 [3]. This can be easily done in the conventional 4 ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy using the <b>ancillary</b> <b>ports.</b> However, in order to minimize the number of ports, there are few methods available for gall bladder (GB) retraction in SILC that can substitute the usage of <b>ancillary</b> <b>ports</b> imitating retraction from conventional technique, e. g. trans-parietal stitch [4, 5], mini-loop retractor [6], a Kirschner wire [7]. We applied the transparietal stitch in our previous paper [8], but we had to introduce it in the last intercostal space to avoid lung injury and that may lead to pneumothorax. However, the disadvantage of this method is that the gall bladder is retracted perpen-dicular instead of cephalad direction and making some degree of masking of the Calot's triangle and in some patients. It would be necessary to place additional sutures in the body and infundibulum for adequate exposure [9]. We describe a novel technique for GB fundus retraction in SILC procedure...|$|R
30|$|When the {{pneumoperitoneum}} is achieved, specific laparoscopic port {{instruments are}} introduced through the abdominal wall. Port instruments consist of several components: a central trocar, a corresponding peripheral cannula, a valve section, and a CO 2 stopcock. After insertion of this instrument, the central trocar is removed {{and the remaining}} cannula functions as an access port for laparoscopic instruments. The primary port, generally created {{in or near the}} umbilicus, is used for the introduction of the laparoscope. The creation of the primary laparoscopic port is called “primary entry.” Secondary or <b>ancillary</b> <b>ports</b> are intended for the introduction of other laparoscopic instruments. The creation of secondary ports is called “secondary entry.” The method of port creation, the port instruments’ design, and the port location influence the risk of port-related complications.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{developed}} by local businessman Eduardo Madero and designed by British engineer Sir John Hawkshaw, Puerto Madero was inaugurated in 1897. Its four docks were relegated to <b>ancillary</b> <b>port</b> functions after the 1926 {{completion of the}} New Port to the north, however, and became derelict. Beginning around 1994, however, local and foreign investment led to a massive revitalization effort, recycling and refurbishing the west side warehouses into upscale offices, lofts, restaurants, private universities and luxurious hotels. State-of-the-art multiplex cinemas, theatres, cultural centres, luxurious hotels and office and corporate buildings are located mostly in {{the eastern side of}} the district.|$|E
30|$|Materials and methods: Between October 2007 and May 2008 {{consecutive}} patients {{addressed to}} surgery {{for the treatment}} of apparently early stage endometrial cancer were enrolled in this study. Elevated BMI was not considered as a contraindication to micro-laparoscopy. The micro-laparoscopic procedures were carried out with 3 -mm instruments introduced through three <b>ancillary</b> <b>port</b> sites and a 5 -mm umbilical telescope. Surgical staging included peritoneal cytology, total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and bilateral systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy. Data obtained were than compared to those of the last 50 patients treated for endometrial cancer with conventional laparoscopic approach. Operative time, blood loss, lymph nodes count and hospitalization were considered as primary end-points.|$|E
30|$|At {{the end of}} the procedure, a 16 -gauge, 36 -cm needle was {{inserted}} through an <b>ancillary</b> <b>port,</b> and 40  ml of 0.5  % lidocaine was sprayed over the diaphragmatic vault. After the removal of all trocars, the SC tissue of the insertion sites was injected with 5  ml of bupivacaine. Pain control during the procedure was scored on a scale of 1 to 4, indicating excellent, good, sufficient, and poor pain control, respectively. Postoperative analgesics were given when requested by the patient. The analgesics consisted of 100  mg of Dicolfenac Sodium (IM) or 30  mg of ketorolac (IM). No oral postoperative medications were administered, even after hospital discharge. Patients were discharged only when completely free of discomfort.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackground and purposeTo {{evaluate}} the feasibility {{and safety of}} conventional laparoscopic instruments in common urological laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) procedures. MethodsFrom 2008 to 2010, we retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected data from 100 patients who underwent LESS procedures by a single surgeon for various common urological indications. The LESS operations included adrenalectomy (n= 15), radical nephrectomy (n= 3), radical nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff resection (n= 5), varicocelectomy (n= 12), nephropexy (n= 4), lumbar sympathectomy (n= 4), and adult hernia mesh repair (n= 57). ResultsAll procedures were completed successfully without <b>ancillary</b> <b>ports</b> or articulating instruments, except in two cases that required laparoscopic conversion. The mean patient age was 48. 9 years, and the mean body mass index was 23. 8. The mean operative time was 99. 7 minutes, the mean estimated blood loss was 17. 3 mL, and the mean hospital stay was 2. 1 days. No intra-operative complication occurred. ConclusionOur experience revealed that the usage of conventional laparoscopic instruments is feasible and safe in common urological LESS procedures...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We present {{our initial}} {{experience}} with single-port access (SPA) surgery using a novel laparoscopic port (Octo-Port). Materials, Methods, and Results: In a prospective study, SPA surgery {{was carried out}} on 11 patients with the Octo-Port from July 2009 to December 2009 by a single surgeon (T. -J. K.). The procedures carried out were hysterectomy (seven patients), ovarian cystectomy (two patients) and salpingo-oophorectomy (two patients). In 10 cases the procedure was successfully performed {{without the use of}} additional ports. In one case the SPA procedure failed and <b>ancillary</b> <b>ports</b> were required; this patient had anatomical variations that made use of the SPA technique difficult. All procedures were performed without complications. There were no perioperative port-related or surgical problems. The Octo-Port had certain advantages such as reducing the need for long laparoscopic instruments, reducing extracorporeal instrumental crowding, and providing better deflection of smoke compared to other SPA devices that used a wound retractor and a glove. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the Octo-Port allows laparoscopic surgery to be performed safely and easily with a reduced number of ports...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the unique}} {{techniques}} we {{used in this study}} is placement of the ports at the umbilicus and left upper quadrant. The vesicouterine peritoneum was easily accessed through the left upper quadrant port and, subsequently, the umbilical port. Instrument handling was convenient, and visibility was equally adequate using both the umbilical and left upper quadrant port sites. In a comparable study using two ports, a 2 -mm minilaparoscope is fixed in the right lower quadrant, and the use of a laparoscopic instrument was possible only through the umbilical port [16]. Therefore, dissecting the vesicouterine peritoneum is not possible using this laparoscopic approach; thus, visualization and identification of the peritoneum are instead performed using a light-endorsed transvaginal section in the vaginal phase. Also, there has been a study on two-port LAVH using supraumbilical multichannel port and an <b>ancillary</b> <b>port,</b> but this method needed a 15 -mm incision in the supraumbilical area for insertion of multichannel port. On the other hand, we used one 12 -mm trocar and one 5 -mm trocar [5].|$|E
30|$|Methods: We {{retrospectively}} studied 43 patients (two-port group: 11, three-port group: 32) who had simple sapingectomy {{using the}} two-trocar or three-trocar technique. In gynecologic department {{of a university}} hospital, the same surgeon performed pelviscopic salpingectomy with two ports or three ports. A 10 or 5  mm 0 ° usual telescope umbilical trocar, {{and one or two}} low abdominal trocar were used. In two port technique, the operation was performed only through the ancillary trocar with uterine manipulator assistance under telescope view. Salpingectomy was performed with electrical cautery devices and removed with an atraumatic forcep through 5 or 10  mm ancillary trocar. The motion of uterus with a uterine manipulator worked as the counter traction of a salpinx by a forcep in the conventional three or four-port pelviscopy. In this way, 3 rd ancillary trocar was saved. The drainage bag was inserted in the pelvic cavity through the <b>ancillary</b> <b>port,</b> skin sutures were done. The clinical data of these patients were analyzed for the evaluation of operative outcomes of the two study groups.|$|E
30|$|The {{number of}} myomas removed per patient was 2.2 [*]±[*] 1.9. The {{diameter}} and {{volume of the}} biggest fibroid was 7.0 [*]±[*] 2.5  cm and 168.7 [*]±[*] 165.6  cm 3 respectively. The biggest fibroid was intramural in 76 % and subserosal in 24 % of the cases. The total volume of removed fibroids per patient was 193.2 [*]±[*] 173.4  cm 3. The endometrial cavity was never opened. The median operating time was 95 [70 – 125] minutes with a correlation with total volume of myomas, maximum volume and number of myomas removed. The median blood loss was 200 [100 – 450] mL. No intra-operative local vasoconstrictive drugs were used. Ninety-seven interventions were performed under spinal-epidural anesthesia and 110 under general anesthesia. The conversion rate to laparotomic procedure was 5.8 %. Blood transfusion rate was 2 %. Two major complications (1 %) were observed after the procedure: two cases of haemoperitoneum respectively caused by bleeding from the major <b>ancillary</b> <b>port</b> and from the uterine suture and treated by laparotomic intervention.|$|E
30|$|Pneumoperitoneum during {{sterilisation}} {{was achieved}} via intraumbilical Verres needle insufflation after a Palmer saline test. A 10 -mm trocar was inserted intraumbilically and omental adhesion involving the small bowel {{and the lower}} anterior abdominal wall, obscuring the view of both adnexa, was noted. The view of the adnexa was only possible after inserting the <b>ancillary</b> lateral <b>ports</b> and retraction of the omental adhesion. The patient’s uterus was retroverted and bulky. Her fallopian tubes and ovaries were unremarkable.|$|R
40|$|Background/PurposeThe {{technical}} and ergonomic details of laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) reconstruction {{have not been}} reported. In this study, we explored the feasibility and safety of performing advanced LESS upper urinary tract reconstruction with conventional laparoscopic instruments. MethodsBetween September 2010 and March 2011, we retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected data from five patients who underwent LESS urinary tract reconstruction. The LESS reconstruction included pyeloureterostomy (N =  1), dismembered pyeloplasty (N =  2), ureteroneocystostomy (N =  1), and ureteroplasty for bifid blind ending ureter (N =  1). The perioperative and postoperative parameters were collected for analysis. The ergonomic principles and techniques are detailed. ResultsAll reconstructive LESS procedures were completed successfully without open conversion or laparoscopic conversion. <b>Ancillary</b> <b>ports</b> or <b>ancillary</b> instruments were not applied {{in any of the}} patients. The mean patient age was 40. 4 years. The mean operative time was 213  ±  69 minutes, the estimated blood loss ranged from minimal to 50  mL, and the mean hospital stay was 4. 4  ±  4 days. No operation-related complication occurred. ConclusionBased on our ergonomic principles and suturing/knotting techniques, conventional laparoscopic instruments are feasible and safe for LESS urinary reconstructive procedures...|$|R
40|$|Ovarian cysts are {{a common}} cause of {{hospital}} admission in several countries. For this reason, {{and because of the}} increasing impact of minimal access surgery in clinical practice, a preoperative assessment that offers a reasonable degree of accuracy is necessary. While transabdominal ultrasonography has not been useful because of relatively poor resolution, the transvaginal probe increases the accuracy of ultrasonography, reducing the risk of unexpected malignancy at laparoscopy. This risk can be further reduced by thorough inspection at laparoscopy characterized by high sensitivity, and by selecting a population with a low risk of ovarian malignancy, such as women of reproductive age. Within this population, it is important to distinguish the different kinds of benign ovarian cysts. A principal ultrasonographic criterion among women of reproductive age is the persistence of the mass. Consideration of the latter feature should reduce the number of unnecessary operative laparoscopies, also reducing the number of wrong differential diagnoses. The above-mentioned approach, {{associated with the use of}} simple ultrasonographic findings, seems to have given good reproducibility and accuracy in the differential diagnosis of ‘clear’ cysts, dermoids and endometriomas in premenopausal women. This approach should permit the preparation of suitable laparoscopic instrumentation and enable the surgeon to decide on the siting of <b>ancillary</b> <b>ports,</b> with the aim of reducing the number of unintended laparotomies and avoiding the risk of complications such as spillage in the case of unrecognized teratomas...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo present {{our initial}} {{experiences}} in transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) for adnexal surgeries and hysterectomies. Materials and MethodsFrom September 2010 to December 2010, {{a total of}} 15 patients with benign adnexal or uterine diseases who were eligible for laparoscopic surgeries were recruited to undergo transvaginal NOTES at a tertiary referral medical center. Intraoperative and postoperative surgical outcomes were measured. ResultsTransvaginal NOTES was successfully completed in five adnexal surgeries and 10 hysterectomies without complications, an <b>ancillary</b> <b>port</b> on the abdomen, or conversion to conventional laparoscopy or laparotomy. For the 10 hysterectomies, the surgical time was 93. 4  ±  6. 3 minutes (mean ± standard deviation), intraoperative estimated blood loss 245  ±  54. 0  mL, uterine weight 440. 1  ±  76. 5  g, and the postoperative hospital stay 2. 7  ±  0. 3 days. No patients required intraoperative blood transfusion. The two tubal sterilizations were completed in 18 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively, with negligible blood loss. The two salpingectomies, including one ruptured ectopic pregnancy with 2000  mL hemoperitoneum, were completed in 62 minutes and 116 minutes, respectively. The enucleation was completed in 64 minutes with 20  mL estimated blood loss. ConclusionOur preliminary results indicate that transvaginal NOTES for adnexal surgeries and hysterectomies is feasible and safe. However, this procedure is still new and should only {{be used as an}} alternative for conventional laparoscopic surgery in highly selected cases...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} safety and {{effectiveness}} of the harmonic scalpel and conventional electrosurgery in laparoscopic myomectomy (LM). Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 591 women with symptomatic uterine fibroids who underwent LM. Thirty-three cases of LMs with harmonic scalpel (LMH) were compared with a matched control group that underwent conventional electrosurgery (LME). Outcome measures for both groups were studied comparatively {{in terms of the}} amount of blood loss, requirement of blood transfusion, length of operative time, cost, and hospital stay. Results: There was no incidence of switching to abdominal laparotomy. Length of postoperative stay was significantly lower in the LMH group than in the LME group (2. 0 ± 0. 4 days vs. 2. 5 ± 0. 7 days, p< 0. 001), but the hospital charges were significantly higher in the LMH group than in the LME group (39, 207. 7 ± 9315. 0 new Taiwan dollar vs. 24, 078. 4 ± 11, 051. 3 new Taiwan dollar, p< 0. 001). Four minor complications were noted in the LME group; two developed lower-grade febrile morbidity, one had urinary tract infection, and one had subcutaneous ecchymosis at the left <b>ancillary</b> <b>port</b> site. Length of operation, blood loss, hemoglobin decrease, and requirement of blood transfusion were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion: Harmonic scalpel is as safe and effective as conventional electrosurgery, and may offer an alternative option for patients undergoing LM. Harmonic scalpel has advantage over conventional electrosurgery in less postoperative hospital stay but disadvantage in higher cost...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare {{perioperative}} {{outcomes and}} postoperative pain of minilaparoscopic (M-LPS) and laparoendoscopic single-site total hysterectomy (LESS). DESIGN: Prospectively randomized study (Canadian Task Force classification II- 2). SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome. PATIENTS: A total of 86 patients underwent total hysterectomy. Seventy-one met the inclusion criteria and {{were included in}} this study. Three of them refused randomization, 34 {{were randomly assigned to}} undergo to single-port hysterectomy and 34 to undergo to minilaparoscopy. INTERVENTIONS: The operative technique is the same in the 2 groups with the exception of videolaparoscopy, port type, and some specific instruments. All surgical procedures were performed with an intrauterine manipulator. Single-port hysterectomy was performed through a multichannel single trocar inserted in the umbilicus. Minilaparoscopic hysterectomy was performed through one optical transumbilical 5 -mm trocar and three 3 -mm suprapubic <b>ancillary</b> <b>ports.</b> MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. The baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were comparable. Median operative time was longer in LESS with respect to M-LPS (120 minutes vs 90 minutes; p =. 038).

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{learning}} curve and safety of laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery of gynecological surgeries. Materials and methods: Sixty-three women who underwent LESS surgery by a single experienced laparoscopic surgeon from February 2011 to August 2011 were included. Commercialized single-incision laparoscopic surgery homemade ports were used, along with conventional straight instruments. The learning curve {{has been defined as}} the additional surgical time with respect to surgical order of LESS surgery, which has been estimated using a smooth function in a linear model with generalized least squares, with some adjustments made due to influencing factors of the operations. Results: All women completed LESS surgeries without the need for <b>ancillary</b> <b>ports,</b> except for two laparotomy conversions due to incidental ovarian malignancy. Three women, one with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, one with laparoscopic myomectomy, and one who had been receiving simultaneous hysteroscopic myomectomy, were excluded. Of the 58 women included, 39 underwent adnexal surgeries and 19 underwent hysterectomies. Complications occurred with one woman who required a blood transfusion during the procedure. Surgical time was longer in bilateral cystectomy compared with unilateral cystectomy and unilateral/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (110. 6  ±  51. 1 minutes vs. 73. 0  ±  26. 3 minutes and 66. 3  ±  26. 9 minutes; p <  0. 03); and in laparoscopic total/subtotal hysterectomy (LTH/LSH) compared with laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) (205. 6  ±  23. 3 minutes vs. 120. 1  ±  28. 6 minutes; P <  0. 001). The fitted linear model showed that surgical time was longer in cases with larger adnexal mass, more pelvic adhesion, and more blood loss. Surgical time was longer in LTH/LSH compared with LAVH. Surgical order of LESS surgery was not associated with surgical time. Conclusion: LESS is a safe and feasible alternative to conventional laparoscopic surgery for adnexal and uterine diseases. A learning curve is not required for LESS surgery for experienced laparoscopic surgeons...|$|R
30|$|This is a {{prospective}} observational study of 323 patients who underwent a laparoscopic myomectomy from March 2004 to November 2016. All patients were operated on {{by a single}} surgeon at Whipps Cross University Hospital Trust. The only exclusion criteria was uterine size greater than 28  weeks size limiting access to the pelvis. A standardised technique was used; initial entry was through an intra-umbilical incision or palmer’s point {{in cases where the}} uterine size was more than 14  weeks, with two 5  mm <b>ancillary</b> lateral <b>ports</b> and a suprapubic port. For haemostasis, 800  μg misoprostol was administered rectally and vasopressin injected intra-myometrially unless contraindicated. For uterine manipulation, a ClearView™ (Clinical Innovations) uterine manipulator was used to achieve the optimum uterine position. For most cases, the Harmonic™ (Ethicon) scalpel was used, but more recently, alternative ultrasonic energy devices such as Thunderbeat™ (Olympus) have been introduced. A 5  mm myoma screw and grasping forceps were used for traction and counter traction. Initially, the resulting defects were closed in two or three layers as required using polyglactin sutures for the myometrium and monofilament sutures used for the serosa; however, more recently, self-retaining sutures such as V-loc™ (Covidien) and Stratafix™ (Ethicon) have been introduced. For adhesion prevention, due to the discontinuation of Sprayshield™ (Covidien), Interceed™ (Ethicon) has been used since 2014. Myomas were removed by electro-mechanical morcellation through the suprapubic port, currently without the use of containment/morcellation bags, and sent for histology. Initially, we used the Johnson and Johnson Ethicon morcellator; however, when it was withdrawn, we changed to the RotoCut morcellator (Stortz), and more recently, we have been using the LiNA morcellator.|$|R
30|$|Patients {{routinely}} underwent {{general anesthesia}} with endotracheal intubation {{followed by the}} placement of a uterine manipulator in a dorsal lithotomy position. Cefazedone sodium (1  g) was injected intravenously 30  min before the induction of anesthesia. After lifting the anterior abdominal wall, a 5 -mm port was directly inserted at the infraumbilicus with a vertical skin incision. Carbon dioxide was insufflated through the port sleeve to create a pneumoperitoneum, and the intra-abdominal pressure was maintained at 15  mmHg. The intra-abdominal cavity was inspected with a 5 -mm telescope. Transillumination was used to locate the superior and inferior epigastric vessels, and direct visualization was used to insert a secondary <b>ancillary</b> 5 -mm <b>port</b> into the left upper quadrant. The 5 -mm infraumbilical port was replaced with a 12 -mm port (Fig.  1). If adhesiolysis was necessary, bipolar grasping forceps and endoscissors were inserted sequentially into the left upper quadrant port site. The 5 -mm telescope was shifted to the left upper quadrant 5 -mm port, and an endoscopic stapler (Endoscopic Linear Cutter®, Ethicon Endo-surgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA) was inserted into the umbilical 12 -mm port. An assistant moved the uterus using the uterine manipulator on tension to one side. At the same time, the ovarian ligament, the salpinx, and the round ligament were simultaneously transected by the endoscopic stapler. This procedure was repeated on the contralateral side. A bladder flap was created by dissecting the broad ligament {{in front of the}} uterine artery with the endoscissors. If necessary, the ovary was removed by simultaneously transecting the infundibulopelvic ligament and the round ligament with the endoscopic stapler. When the laparoscopic step was completed, the carbon dioxide gas was removed, and vaginal portion of the procedure was performed in the usual fashion. The vaginal vault was sutured after insertion of a Foley catheter. Once again, the abdomen was insufflated, a survey was performed to ensure hemostasis, and we have confirmed any possible ureteric injuries in all operations by observing and identifying the peristalsis, the absence of dilation of the both ureters after surgery, and by tracing its direction to the bladder (Fig.  2). A drainage tube was inserted into the left upper quadrant through the 5 -mm port in some patients when persistent oozing was present or adhesiolysis had been performed.|$|R
