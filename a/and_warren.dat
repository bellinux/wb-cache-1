5|$|Owing {{to several}} {{academic}} commitments, work on Theory of Literature {{did not begin}} until 1945, after Wellek <b>and</b> <b>Warren</b> received a stipend from the Rockefeller Foundation {{over a period of}} two summers.

5|$|The first section, {{entitled}} Definitions and Distinctions, {{consists of}} five chapters and details how Wellek <b>and</b> <b>Warren</b> define literature.

They note that literary scholarship should not only examine what makes a work or author unique, but also its general characteristics that allow it to be compared to other works.|$|E
