40|$|For {{more than}} six decades, chromic acid {{anodizing}} (CAA) has been the central process in the surface pre-treatment of aluminum for adhesively bonded aircraft structures. Unfortunately, this electrolyte contains hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), a compound known for its toxicity and carcinogenic properties. To comply with the new strict international regulations, the Cr(VI) -era will soon {{have to come to}} an end. Anodizing aluminum in acid electrolytes produces a self-ordered porous oxide layer. Although different acids can be used to create this type of structure, the excellent adhesion and corrosion resistance that is currently achieved by the complete Cr(VI) -based process is not easily matched. This paper provides a critical overview and appraisal of proposed alternatives to CAA, including combinations of multiple anodizing steps, pre- and post <b>anodizing</b> <b>treatments.</b> The work is presented in terms of the modifications to the oxide properties, such as morphological features (e. g., pore size, barrier layer thickness) and surface chemistry, in order to evaluate the link between fundamental principles of adhesion and bond performance.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Titanium has {{outstanding}} {{corrosion resistance}} {{due to the}} thin protective oxide layer that is formed on its surface. Nevertheless, in harsh and severe environments, pure titanium may suffer localized corrosion. In those conditions, costly titanium alloys containing palladium, nickel and molybdenum are used. This purpose investigated {{how it is possible}} to control corrosion, at lower cost, by electrochemical surface treatment on pure titanium, increasing the thickness of the natural oxide layer. METHODS: Anodic oxidation was performed on titanium by immersion in H 2 SO 4 solution and applying voltages ranging from 10 to 80 V. Different anodic current densities were considered. Potentiodynamic tests in chloride- and fluoride-containing solutions were carried out on anodized titanium to determine the pitting potential. RESULTS: All tested <b>anodizing</b> <b>treatments</b> increased corrosion resistance of pure titanium, but never reached the performance of titanium alloys. The best corrosion behavior was obtained on titanium anodized at voltages lower than 40 V at 20 mA/cm 2.

40|$|International audienceTribocorrosion {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the lifetime of metallic implants. Once implanted, biomaterials are subjected to micro-movements in aggressive biological fluids. Titanium is widely used as an implant material because it spontaneously forms a compact and protective nanometric thick oxide layer, mainly TiO 2, in ambient air. That layer provides good corrosion resistance, and very low toxicity, but its low wear resistance is a concern. In this work, an <b>anodizing</b> <b>treatment</b> was performed on commercial pure titanium to form a homogeneous thick oxide surface layer in order to provide bioactivity and improve the biological, chemical and mechanical properties.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{anodizing}} of Ti in {{the various}} concentration of H 3 PO 4 aqueous solutions gave TiO 2 films, and the osteoconductivity was examined using in vivo testing. In the <b>anodizing</b> <b>treatment,</b> anodizing potential of < 200 V {{was applied to the}} Ti substrate in H 3 PO 4 aqueous solutions with the concentration of 0. 1 to 14 M at 298 K.

In H 3 PO 4 aqueous solutions with any concentration, anatase-type TiO 2 films were obtained on the Ti substrate by anodizing. The crystallinity of anodized TiO 2 films depended on the concentration of H 3 PO 4 and sparking. In less than 2 M H 3 PO 4, anatase with high crystallinity was formed. On the other hand, anodizing with sparking in more than 4 M H 3 PO 4, gave low crystallinity anatase film.

40|$|The present work {{concerns}} on preparing suitable {{titanium alloy}} substrate that might induce better characteristic of titanium oxide layer on the substrate. Different degrees of cold rolling treatments were applied on Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy before thermal-electrochemical anodizing processes.

After thermal heat treatment process, it was observed more homogeneous titanium oxide layer for the samples given cold rolling treatment as compared with sample without the treatment. This condition is believed due to the finer substrate surface after cold rolling treatment as observed from surface roughness measurement. Similar situation was observed after anodizing process that irregular oxidized layer was observed for sample without cold rolling treatment, whereas more homogenous layer was observed for sample with cold rolling treatment. Except for sample without cold rolling treatment, <b>anodizing</b> <b>treatment</b> tends to create finer oxidized layer.

Hard <b>anodizing</b> <b>treatment</b> is here crucial for increasing both corrosion and abrasion resistance, but the presence of typical intermetallic precipitates makes the obtainment of a performing non-defective oxide difficult. Different anodizing procedures in direct current (DC), multistep direct current (MSDC), pulsed current (PC) (slow square pulse mode) and their appropriate combination (DC&PC) were studied aiming at obtaining the optimal mechanical properties/thickness/defectiveness compromise. DC and MSDC results showed good hardness values while their optical microscopy characterization indicated a poor defectiveness state; PC modality induced a moderate loss in mechanical performances in all the different duty cycles experimented, while an extremely low defected oxide was obtained with a duty cycle of 50 %.

40|$|Oxide {{films have}} been {{produced}} on AM 60 B magnesium alloy by micro-arc anodic oxidation in an environmentally friendly alkaline solution, with and without addition of nanoparticles (TiO 2, ZrO 2 and Al 2 O 3). Because of the anodic oxide porosity, inherent in the sparking process, organo-functional silanes top coat {{has been applied to}} seal pores and cracks, and achieve an efficient protective coating system. The surface and cross-section morphology of samples were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) coupled with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). Scratch tests were performed for evaluating the adhesion strength and scratch hardness of the anodic oxides to the AM 60 B substrate. The corrosion resistance of both anodic oxides and oxide/silane composite coatings was evaluated in 0. 6 M NaCl solution using potentiodynamic polarization tests. The addition of nanoparticles to the anodizing solution doesn't affect significantly the corrosion resistance in comparison with anodic oxides produced in nanoparticles free solutions. Conversely, the adhesion strength and scratch hardness of the anodic oxides to the substrate is quite scattered, and it is higher for the samples produced in ZrO 2 and in Al 2 O 3 rich solutions. For this reason specimens anodized in ZrO 2 and Al 2 O 3 containing solutions were chosen for silane deposition. Two silanes were used, namely octyltrimethoxysilane (OSi) and 1, 2 -bis [triethoxysilyl] ethane (BTSE).

40|$|Among all {{biomaterials}} {{used for}} bone replacement, it is recognized that both commercially pure titanium (Ti c. p.) and Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy are the materials {{that show the}} best in vivo performance due to their excellent balance between mechanical, physical-chemical and biofunctional properties. However, one of its main drawbacks, which compromise the service reliability of the implants and its osteointegration capacity, is the thin film of fibrous tissue around the implant due to the bioinert behaviour of titanium. One of the alternatives more studied to improve the titanium osteointegration is the surface modification through {{the control of the}} roughness parameters within a specific range which is recognized that improve the osteoblasts adhesion. In this work is investigated the influence of different electrochemical processing conditions for surface modification of c. p. Ti, in their microstructural, morphological, topographical and mechanical properties, as well as in their biological behaviour. The electrochemical <b>anodizing</b> <b>treatment</b> was performed by using different electrolytes based on phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4), sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) with a fluoride salt; and the Focused Ion Beam (FIB) technique, normally named as Nanolab, was used for the microstructural, chemical and morphological characterization, as well as the confocal laser microscopy technique which also served for roughness measurements. The mechanical response of the anodic layers was evaluated through the using of a scratch tester which showed the critical loads for the coating damages. The characterization results showed that both, concentrations and electrolyte species, clearly influenced the morphological and topographical features, as well as the chemical composition of the anodic layer. By using the FIB was possible to detect nanopores within both the surface and the bulk of the coating. Some of the conditions generated a very special coating morphology which promoted a better osteoblasts adhesion. Contrary to what it was a priory expected, all anodic coatings showed high critical loads for damages during scratch test, despite their high porosity, which could be related with some defects coalescence mechanism that allows dissipating the high stress concentration applied during the test.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the in vitro osteogenic potential of subcultured human osteoblastic cells derived from alveolar bone on a titanium (Ti) surface produced by an <b>anodized</b> alkali <b>treatment</b> (BSP-AK). Primary osteoblastic cells were subcultured on BSP-AK and machined Ti discs (control) and grown for periods of up to 21 days under osteogenic conditions. Morphologic and biochemical methods were used to assess important parameters of in vitro bone-like tissue formation. Although no major differences were observed between the BSP-AK and the control Ti surface in terms of cell attachment and mineralized matrix formation, a significant increase in cell population, ALP activity, and collagen content was detected in cultures on BSP-AK surface. Our results demonstrate that human osteoblastic cells are sensitive to the BSP-AK-modified Ti surface during the transitional stage between the end of the proliferative phase and the onset of the differentiation /matrix maturation ones.

40|$|Anodizing {{could be}} used for bio-functionalization of the {{surfaces}} of titanium alloys. In this study, we use anodizing for creating nanotubes on the surface of porous titanium alloy bone substitutes manufactured using selective laser melting. Different sets of anodizing parameters (voltage: 10 or 20 V anodizing time: 30 min to 3 h) are used for anodizing porous titanium structures that were later heat treated at 500 °C. The nanotopographical features are examined using electron microscopy while the bioactivity of anodized surfaces is measured using immersion tests in the simulated body fluid (SBF). Moreover, the effects of <b>anodizing</b> and heat <b>treatment</b> on the performance of one representative anodized porous titanium structures are evaluated using in vitro cell culture assays using human periosteum-derived cells (hPDCs). It has been shown that while anodizing with different anodizing parameters results in very different nanotopographical features, i. e. nanotubes in the range of 20 to 55 nm, anodized surfaces have limited apatite-forming ability regardless of the applied anodizing parameters. The results of in vitro cell culture show that both anodizing, and thus generation of regular nanotopographical feature, and heat treatment improve the cell culture response of porous titanium. In particular, cell proliferation measured using metabolic activity and DNA content was improved for anodized and heat treated as well as for anodized but not heat-treated specimens. Heat treatment additionally improved the cell attachment of porous titanium surfaces and upregulated expression of osteogenic markers. Anodized but not heat-treated specimens showed some limited signs of upregulated expression of osteogenic markers. In conclusion, while varying the anodizing parameters creates different nanotube structure, it does not improve apatite-forming ability of porous titanium.
