The Canadian monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles, and Princess Anne, undertook in 1970 a tour of Northern Canada, in part to demonstrate to an unconvinced American government and the Soviet Union that Canada had certain claim to its Arctic territories, which were strategic during the Cold War. In addition, Canada claims the water within the Canadian Arctic Archipelago as its own internal waters.

Abrupt emergence of land is suggested for the Hokkaido and Sakhalin <b>archipelagic</b> <b>water</b> regions based on recent geological studies because of the cooling related to the NHG between 3 and 2  Ma (e.g., Sagayama 2002; Yahata 2002; Kharakhinov 2010). Thus, the exchange of subarctic water via the northernmost seaway would have been affected (Sagayama 2002; Yahata 2002; Kharakhinov 2010). For this interval (3.5 – 2.7  Ma), our data show that the transitional-subarctic species and transitional-subtropical species had relative abundances varying between 20 and 40 % and 10 and 20 %, respectively (Fig.  9). Between 3.8 and 2.7  Ma, our data imply that the Japan Sea was probably still influenced by transitional-subarctic and transitional-subtropical water at that time.|$|R

The essential features of archipelagic state principle laid down by Part IV of LOSC include permission to draw straight archipelagic baselines around the outermost points of the outermost islands of archipelagos; and the recognition of the new and distinct legal regime of <b>archipelagic</b> <b>water</b> for the waters thus enclosed of a nature designed to accommodate the interests of maritime user states, that are states which carry out certain activities, including navigation, in the water areas falling under the jurisdiction of archipelagic states. Since this principle has been Indonesian national philosophical outlook even before the adoption of LOSC and provided within Article 25 (a) of the Indonesian Constitutions, it is submitted that all Indonesian national legislations related to ocean affairs should be based on the archipelagic state principles. This study looks at the legal application of archipelagic state principles in Indonesia within the framework of contemporary ocean governance principles. This paper argued that current development on Indonesian law of the sea as well as ocean governance shows less commitment to archipelagic state principles. Thus, it is submitted that archipelagic state principles should be re-stored as the basis of all ocean related legislations and governance...|$|R

The {{position of the}} Philippine Government is contested {{in the international community}} and runs against rules in the Law of the SeaConvention, which the Philippines signed and ratified.

40|$|Together with cost {{inflation}} and stagnant market prices, the new 200 -nautical-mile regime {{has hit the}} conventional tuna and skipjack fishing industry very hard. Japanese countermeasures consist of domestic adjustments such as cost and risk-reducing devices, withdrawals of fishing vessels, employment of purse-seine fisheries, nearshore fishing ground adjustments, and demand expansion; and external strategies such as historical fishing rights, legal-Informal Composite Negotiating Text (ICNT), and bilateral arrangements. The Japanese claim on historical tuna and skipjack fishing rights in the EEZs and <b>archipelagic</b> <b>waters</b> of coastal states in Southeast Asia and the western central Pacific is based on 1) discovery of the fishing grounds by the Japanese, 2) risk-taking for development by the Japanese, 3) continuous and habitual Japanese fishing activities in the region, 4) long legal practices under the Japanese fisheries licensing system, and 5) {{the importance of the}} fishery. Although most coastal nations in Southeast Asia and the western central Pacific treat tuna and skipjack in their EEZs as their national properties, the position of the ICNT emphasizes that highly migratory species such as tuna and skipjack are managed by cooperation among the countries concerned and international cooperation is essential to manage those fishery wisely. Bilateral arrangements such as fee fishing and joint-ventures, associated with overseas cooperation, have been successful in terms of fishing access to the EEZs and <b>archipelagic</b> <b>waters</b> of coastal states in the region, but current arrangements become increasingly difficult due to coastal nations' desires to increase fishing fees and take part in joint-ventures. Emergence of subregional management schemes will become more important for dealing with highly migratory species like tuna and skipjack, but Japan is not yet ready for such schemes. The legal, political, and economic constraints on each of the strategies are numerous and combine to aggravate the problem. Although the Japanese government has committed to easing the adjustment of Japanese fishermen to the new ocean regime, the job is not easy. The problem involves not only the Japanese, but also coastal, resource-owning nations as well. Joint arrangements have many advantages over attempts by any one nation to go it alone. However, in order to arrive at successful arrangements, it is essential for each party to understand the interests, capabilities, and limitations of the other. A new international cooperation toward sound tuna and skipjack management can emerge only if each sets reasonable goals and recognizes a gradual growth process while seeking benefits for the welfare of both...|$|E

For data, we {{made use of}} satellite-derived Sea surface temperature (SST), and sea surface height (SSH), wind data (W), and precipitation (P). Results show that the Philippines naturally divide into 11 exposure clusters. Within each cluster the trends and anomalies of SST, anomalies and future scenarios of precipitation, and trends of sea surface height (SSH) were further calculated. Results were then compared amongst the clusters and against global statistics to gain insight on the behavior {{in each of the}} clusters. Analysis shows that the entire Philippines suffer twice to 3 -times the magnitude of the global sea level rise. The northwestern (cluster II) and the tip of the northeastern (cluster X) coastal and marine areas of the Philippines are most prone to extreme temperature and precipitation hazards. In comparison the south Sulu Sea (cluster XI) and Sulawesi (cluster VI) are the sites with the lowest magnitude of air-sea hazards.

Threats or {{objections}} to Canadian claims to sovereignty {{and to the}} exercise of sovereign rights by Canada in the Arctic in the 40 years since World War II {{have come from the}} United States. In the immediate postwar era Canadian sovereignty over minor areas of the Arctic Islands was not unchallengeable. Canadian concerns focused on the desire of the United States to establish weather stations in the Arctic with or without Canadian support. By the early 1950 s. and with bilateral agreements with the United States on the DEW Line and BMEWS, Canadian terrestrial sovereignty was beyond question. Canadian maritime claims continued to be c ntested during the balance of the period. These claims have taken the form of functional jurisdiction over pollution, an historic title to the waters of the archipelago and the rejection of an “international ” status for the waters of the Northwest Passage. Canadian maritime claims in the Arctic have not been consistently formulated or consistently pursued by the Canadian government during the period due to an evolving international law of the sea and American objections. The Canadian position on fu ctional jurisdiction over pollution has been vindicated by the Law of the Sea Convention, but there continue to be significant doubts as to the status of the <b>archipelagic</b> <b>waters...</b>|$|E
