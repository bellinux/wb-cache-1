In 2006, Kathryn Farley was awarded a Grant for Researcher in Residence by the Daniel Langlois Foundation to chart {{the history of the}} Generative Systems, a groundbreaking instructional program founded in 1970 by Professor Sonia Landy Sheridan at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and trace its seminal impact on the development of technological arts education. Farley worked in close contact with Web designer, Ludovic Carpentier, and archivist Vincent Bonin, to conceive of an interface that illuminates the complex matrix of ideas, processes and practices that Generative Systems gave rise to, drew inspiration from and transformed during its lifespan. Information is arranged within the matrix in a way that emphasizes the interconnected components of the program, helping to demonstrate its collaborative, experimental and process-oriented features in real-time.|$|E

Special attention should be given to eliminating unnecessary details and aligning strokes and objects to pixels in small icon sizes to avoid messy and blurred images.|$|R

50|$|While its {{location}} at the 69th Regiment Armory was only temporary, the current Armory Show {{was inspired by}} the idea of presenting new art from around the world together under one roof in New York City. After several editions at the Gramercy Park Hotel, and also at Chateau Marmont (in 1994), The fair moved to the West Side piers in 2001, originally Piers 88 & 90.

Today, Pier 92 hosts the Modern section while Pier 94 hosts the contemporary section, composed of work by living artists.|$|R
