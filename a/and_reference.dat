40|$|This paper {{studies the}} dierences between {{exceptions}} and continuations via {{the problem of}} expressing exceptions using rst-class continuations in a functional-imperative language.

The rst consists of two terms which are equivalent with respect to contexts containing continuations <b>and</b> <b>references,</b> but which can be distinguished using exceptions. It is shown, however, {{that there are no}} such terms which do not contain callcc. However, there is a 1 sentence of rst-order logic which is satised when interpreted in the domain of programs containing continuations <b>and</b> <b>references</b> but not satised in the domain of programs with exceptions <b>and</b> <b>references...</b>|$|R
5|$|Founded in 1844, Willamette University's {{library was}} started {{two years after}} the {{establishment}} of the school. The library grew to a size of 2,500 volumes in 1874. University Hall (now Waller Hall), which was built in 1867, was one of the homes of the library in the early years. The library was located {{on the third floor of}} the building. The early name for the institution was the Willamette University Library, which by 1901 was a free, general library with both circulating <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> collections. That year the library collection had grown to 4,686 volumes, along with a total of 2,753 pamphlets.|$|E

5|$|Allocators {{were invented}} by Alexander Stepanov {{as part of}} the Standard Template Library (STL). They were {{originally}} intended as a means to make the library more flexible and independent of the underlying memory model, allowing programmers to utilize custom pointer <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> types with the library. However, in the process of adopting STL into the C++ standard, the C++ standardization committee realized that a complete abstraction of the memory model would incur unacceptable performance penalties. To remedy this, the requirements of allocators were made more restrictive. As a result, the level of customization provided by allocators is more limited than was originally envisioned by Stepanov.|$|E
5|$|Although Fodor {{originally}} {{rejected the}} idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, he has in recent years devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposes reductive accounts of the mind. He argues that mental states are multiply realizable {{and that there is}} a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He has also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterizes as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theory of natural selection.|$|E

She said that, while she would not interfere with any deputy clerk who issues marriage licenses, she would not personally issue or authorize any of the forms. She created several altered versions of the Kentucky marriage license form and instructed her deputy clerks to use them, which had her name <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> to the clerk's office removed. The ACLU sued Davis separately for these form alterations, which they found to be of questionable legality. Governor Steve Beshear was asked by Bunning to brief the court on {{the validity of the}} licenses. Governor Beshear acknowledged that Kentucky would recognize the licenses being issued, but he could not verify the legality of the licenses issued or the means by which the marriage licenses were altered. Bunning ultimately denied the ACLU's separate suit, stating the altered forms were likely legal and that Davis was now abiding by the court's order.|$|E

5|$|During the Enlightenment and its {{debates about}} human origins, it became fashionable to {{speculate}} {{about the origin of}} language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led {{to the question of whether}} philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning <b>and</b> <b>reference,</b> cognition and consciousness remain active today.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} set of observations is related to eminently useful practical applications, namely to satellite navigation systems such as the Global Positioning System that are used both for precise positioning and timekeeping. Such systems rely on two sets of atomic clocks: clocks aboard satellites orbiting the Earth, <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> clocks stationed on the Earth's surface. General relativity predicts that these two sets of clocks should tick at slightly different rates, due to their different motions (an effect already predicted by special relativity) and their different positions within the Earth's gravitational field. In order to ensure the system's accuracy, the satellite clocks are either slowed down by a relativistic factor, or that same factor is made part of the evaluation algorithm. In turn, tests of the system's accuracy (especially the very thorough measurements {{that are part of}} the definition of universal coordinated time) are testament to the validity of the relativistic predictions.|$|E
5|$|Oregon State University was {{established}} in 1868. The Oregon Legislative Assembly appropriated $1,000 to the school to buy books for a library in 1876, marking the first instance of the legislature giving funds to the school for a library. In 1887, the library {{was established}} at the school, and in 1890, May Warren was hired as the first full-time librarian. By 1893 the library's collection had grown to 1,950 volumes. After adding 2,600 volumes from 1899 to 1900, the collection stood at 5,000 volumes. At that time the library was a free, general library with both circulating <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> collections with A. J. Stimpson serving as the librarian. The library also had 6,000 pamphlets {{at that time and}} the annual circulation was 8,000.|$|E

5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E

The extension houses an elevator between the basement and two above-ground floors. The first floor has a circulation desk of cherry- and caramel-stained wood with a granite countertop. It was sold to the library by craftsman and village resident Leonard Rerek at a significant discount. The first floor also includes a teen center with computers and a breakout room, {{as well as a}} children's room with its own breakout room. The second floor holds the adult fiction, non-fiction, <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> collections, as well as four computers, library offices, and a partitionable program room seating up to 80 people. The extension's interior was designed by architect, village resident, and library board member Catherine Bukard. The exterior was designed by Lothrop Associates.|$|E
