5|$|The breed {{standard}} {{is a set}} of guidelines which are used to ensure that the animals produced by a breeder or breeding facility conform to the specifics of the standardized breed. All registered Highland cattle must conform to it. The {{breed standard}} was created in Inverness on 10 June 1885. There are four main parts to the standard: the head, the neck, the back and body, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair.</b> Below is a concise list of the main points of the breed standard. A judge in a show will judge the cattle against a provided breed standard.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} parts and {{derivatives}} of pygmy lorises in trade, {{such as the}} skin <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair.</b> All parts of the animal are used in traditional Khmer medicine. In Vietnam, medicine such as bone glue of monkey, is mainly produced by local people, but a smaller portion is also destined for restaurants or sold to visitors. The species is especially used for the assumed medicinal value of its hair. Traders have reported that they have difficulty keeping pace with demand—one trader claimed to have sold nearly 1,200 pygmy slow lorises during 2001–2002. In Cambodia, the deeply rooted tradition of using the Bengal and pygmy slow loris in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow loris is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh.|$|E

25|$|These animals, very {{abundant}} still a {{few decades}} ago, today are threatened by extinction, {{not only because of}} the destruction of their habitat, but especially due to poaching for their horns, which although being made up only of simple keratin, like the nails <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair,</b> are very coveted by Chinese traditional medicine or for the manufacture of handles of daggers in Yemen. The world population exceeded more than 2 million individuals at the beginning of the 19th century, to 18 000 approximately today, all species together.|$|E
25|$|Dholes {{appear in}} Rudyard Kipling's Red Dog, {{where they are}} portrayed as {{aggressive}} and bloodthirsty animals which descend from the Deccan Plateau into the Seeonee Hills inhabited by Mowgli and his adopted wolf pack to cause carnage among the jungle's denizens. They are described as living in packs numbering hundreds of individuals, and that even Shere Khan and Hathi make way for them when they descend into the jungle. The dholes are despised by the wolves because of their destructiveness, their habit of not living in dens <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> between their toes. With Mowgli and Kaa's help, the Seeonee wolf pack manages {{to wipe out the}} dholes by leading them through bee hives and torrential waters before finishing off the rest in battle.|$|E

25|$|The genetic {{mechanism}} behind {{human skin}} color is mainly {{regulated by the}} enzyme tyrosinase, which creates {{the color of the}} skin, eyes, and hair shades. Differences in skin color are also attributed to differences in size and distribution of melanosomes in the skin. Melanocytes produce two types of melanin. The most common form of biological melanin is eumelanin, a brown-black polymer of dihydroxyindole carboxylic acids, and their reduced forms. Most are derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Eumelanin is found in hair, areola, and skin, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> colors gray, black, blond, and brown. In humans, it is more abundant in people with dark skin. Pheomelanin, a pink to red hue is found in particularly large quantities in red hair, the lips, nipples, glans of the penis, and vagina.|$|E
25|$|The monument, {{carved in}} pale blue {{limestone}} by Gerard Johnson, {{is mounted on}} the north wall of the chancel. It features a demi-figure of the poet holding a quill pen {{in one hand and}} a piece of paper resting on a cushion in the other. The style, which was popular from the late 16th to the mid-17th centuries, was most commonly used to memorialize divines, academics, and those professions with pretensions of learning. The buttoned doublet, with its ornamental slashes, was probably originally painted scarlet, the loose subfusc gown black, the eyes hazel, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> and beard auburn. It has been retouched many times, and was painted entirely white in 1793. This demi-figure is one of only two representations definitely accepted as accurately portraying William Shakespeare's physical appearance. The monument is topped with strapwork rising to a heraldic shield displaying Shakespeare's arms, on either side of which sits an allegorical figure: one, representing Labour, holds a spade, the other, representing Rest, holds an inverted torch and a skull.|$|E
25|$|Dressing into a {{dry suit}} is usually more {{time-consuming}} than a wet suit, and may require {{the assistance of}} another person to check the neck seal and close the zipper. In situations where the air is warm but the water cold, a prolonged time {{on the deck of}} a boat donning a dry suit and other gear can present a risk of overheating to the diver. This is a particular problem to relatively inexperienced divers, who may require more time to dress in. This problem can be mitigated by preparing all other equipment as far as possible before fully donning the suit and to wet the outside of the suit, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> and face after closing the zipper, to provide some evaporative cooling while on deck. Professional stand-by divers may have a similar problem, as they are required to be ready for deployment at all times while the working diver is in the water, which may involve waiting on deck for several hours. Wetting the outside of the suit, and seating the diver in shade and a breeze are the usual solution to this problem.|$|E

500|$|The statue was {{financed by}} a [...] "group of generous Portlanders", and its {{commission}} was {{managed by the}} Regional Arts & Culture Council (RACC) with assistance from members of Katz's former staff. It was unveiled on June 2, 2006, on the plaza {{at the south end}} of the Esplanade, just north of the Hawthorne Bridge and Main Street marker. It measures [...] x [...] x [...] and rests on an orange triangular base. Portland State University's Daily Vanguard described Katz as: [...] "leaning close to a small body with legs crossed and hands in, squeezed together in her lap as if she's cold, too. The teeth are also bared and unusually straight, creating the impression that Katz might snap at passers-by. But overall, the face is open <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> is particularly lifelike." [...] She is depicted wearing a Portland rose on her lapel. According to The Oregonian, the sculpture provides a lap on which children can pose and sometimes frightens passersby at night. It is part of the collection of the Regional Arts & Culture Council. The organization has said: [...] "it seems fitting that [...] political leadership and love for the arts should come together in a public tribute to her".|$|E

2500|$|Nor is {{this form}} entirely {{new in the}} history of the plastic arts. The negroes of the Ivory Coast have made use of a very similar method of {{expression}} in their dance masks. These are constructed as follows: a completely flat plane forms the lower part of the face; to this is joined the high forehead, which is sometimes equally flat, sometimes bent slightly backward. While the nose is added as a simple strip of wood, two cylinders protrude about eight centimeters to form the eyes, and one slightly shorter hexahedron forms the mouth. The frontal surfaces of the cylinder and hexahedron are painted, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> is represented by raffia.

2500|$|Approximately {{ninety percent}} of Important Cultural Property and National Treasure sculptures are made of wood. All of Unkei's {{surviving}} works are in this medium. This piece employs the joined-block technique known as yosegi-zukuri, which has the twin advantages of obviating the need for large pieces of timber while facilitating the hollowing-out process which helps reduce shrinkage and cracking. Six main blocks of hinoki or Japanese cypress were used, two vertical blocks arranged side by side and end on for the torso and head; one horizontal piece for the legs; one for the top-knot; and two wedges for the thighs; the arms are assembled {{from a number of}} further pieces. After carving, hollowing, and assembly, the statue was lacquered and covered in gold leaf. The double halo and pedestal are of similar materials. The eyes are of rock crystal, inserted into the open sockets from inside and held in place by bamboo pins, with painted pupils. Eyes formed in this way seem to move in the [...] firelight of a temple and are one of the defining features of the sculpture of the Kamakura period that began a decade later.
