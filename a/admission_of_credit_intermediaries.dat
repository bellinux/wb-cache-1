40|$|The {{dramatic}} increase in securitisation activity experienced in Europe {{in the years following}} the introduction of the euro has altered the liquidity, credit and maturity transformation role traditionally performed by banks. We claim that the changing role <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>intermediaries</b> due to securitisation has also modified the effectiveness of the bank lending channel and banks' ability to grant loans. We use a novel database of securitisation activity and a large sample of European banks and find that the use of securitisation shelters banks' loan supply from the effects of monetary policy. Securitisation activity has also strengthened banks' capacity to supply new loans. This capacity, however, depends on business cycle conditions and, notably, on banks' risks positions. The recent credit crisis is instructive in this respect. Asset securitisation Bank lending channel Monetary policy...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis has generated an impressive debate between practitioners and scholars {{about the causes}} and consequences of the crisis, as well as {{about the effectiveness of}} supervision and the overall architecture of prudential supervision for providing the stability of international financial system (Borio, 2008; Blundell-Wignall, Atkinson, Lee, 2008; Kirkpatrick, 2009; Acharya, Richardson, 2009). From this perspective, particularly interesting has been considered the experience of those banking systems, where the high level of debt achieved by families, can play a determinant role on the availability <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> for the whole economy. More in particular, among other issues, an increasing attention has been dedicated throughout two main objectives for families’ loans demand, namely the request for house’s purchase and consuming sustain (Ferrari et al, 2010).

30|$|The {{convenience}} of a costly investment to collect confidential information may be, however, greater for decisions <b>of</b> opening <b>credit</b> lines to large enterprises, considering {{the amount of}} loans. In this way, larger <b>credit</b> <b>intermediaries</b> could be encouraged to adopt different approaches towards {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} and large companies: transaction banking towards SMEs and relationship lending towards large enterprises.|$|R
30|$|In general, it may {{be noted}} that banks attach less {{importance}} to qualitative information than entrepreneurs. The only information the banks deem highly relevant is that regarding the organization. In this case, however, the importance attributed by <b>credit</b> <b>intermediaries</b> to this information is higher compared to that assigned by the entrepreneur.|$|R
30|$|The {{distance}} between innovator entrepreneurs and external financiers becomes particularly relevant when the financing relationship involves <b>credit</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> In this case, informational opacity between the funder and funded becomes {{an obstacle to}} access credit, as innovator entrepreneurs seem to ignore the relevance of all the quantitative information required by the bank (hypothesis H. 8 confirmed).|$|R
30|$|Finally, <b>credit</b> <b>intermediaries</b> {{assign to}} {{qualitative}} information a similar relevance {{to that of}} venture capitalists. In fact, on average, 59 % believe that qualitative information is critical to investment decisions. In particular, 89 % consider fundamental the information regarding the firm's organization, while only 25 % are particularly attentive to the entrepreneur inventor's scientific curriculum.|$|R

The aim of this paper is to discuss the transposition of the European Consumer Credit Directive into Belgian legislation.

30|$|Obviously, the {{difficulties}} of collecting information on intangible capital are different in large firms than small and medium sized (SMEs). Large firms have a greater capacity to generate information and a greater market visibility. <b>Credit</b> <b>intermediaries</b> can sometimes even indirectly access qualitative information about the company, catching the signalling of the industry in which the company operates (Banks and Sobel 1987; Brighi 2006).|$|R
40|$|Reforms {{to improve}} both {{the level and}} the {{efficiency}} of financial inter-mediation in Brazil should be high on Brazilian policymakers'agendas, because of the financial sector's importance to economic growth. This means that Brazil must also improve the legal and regulatory environment in which its financial institutions operate. Brazil is weak in important components of such creditors, the enforcement of contracts, and the sharing <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> information among <b>intermediaries.</b> Recent reforms, such as the extension of alienacao fiduciaria to housing, the introduction of cedula de credito bancario, the legal separation of principal and interest, and improvements in credit information system, are useful steps in strengthening the framework. But more is needed. Reforms that will significantly increase the level and efficiency of financial inter-mediation, and {{have a positive impact}} on economic growth include: 1) A more efficient judicial sector and better enforcement of contracts. 2) Stronger rights for secured and unsecured creditors. 3) Stronger accounting standards and practices, to improve the quality of information available about borrowers. 4) The development of a legal and regulatory framework that facilitates the exchange among financial institutions of both negative and positive information about borrowers.

5000|$|The Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD) {{lays down}} rules for creditors, <b>credit</b> <b>intermediaries</b> and {{appointed}} sales representatives {{relating to the}} residential immovable market. The MCD applies to credit agreements that are secured by a residential mortgage and to credit agreements that have the purpose to acquire or retain property rights in land or in an existing or projected building. The MCD was introduced by the European Union (EU) as implementation of the G20 commitment to establish principles on sound underwriting standards and to improve the conditions {{for the establishment of}} an internal market in the area <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> agreements relating to residential immovable property. [...] Furthermore, The Mortgage Credit Directive was designed as a preventive measure to avoid irresponsible lending and borrowing behavior by market participants in the EU and to avoid a situation similar to what happened in the United States in 2006-2008, where a real estate bubble affected over half of the United States and left many American citizens either homeless or in huge debts.|$|R
30|$|Although blockchains have a {{technological}} advantage over banks as <b>credit</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> {{it is still}} too early for this technology to completely disrupt the existing financial system. Therefore, a “multi-center, weakly intermediated” scenario is likely to emerge (Chang and Han 2016). This is where banks use blockchain technology to improve their payment clearing systems and overcome certain obstacles in information communication, while also forming consortiums, thereby consolidating their position.|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of the single European banking market {{will result in a}} much larger market than the sum of the various national segments; even the qualitative characteristics of the single market will differ from those of any one national component. European <b>credit</b> <b>intermediaries</b> are now required to undertake major structural changes. In particular, these changes will effect banking systems that are still not very internationalised, often coming about from experiences of protecting the internal market. In this context, the authors investigate the unification <b>of</b> the European <b>credit</b> market, the internationalization of the European banking systems, and the specialisation and comparison of the major Italian groups.     JEL Codes: G 21  </p...|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{the credit}} market {{would be more}} {{efficient}} in allocating resources than the broader financial market because the establishment of more stable and long-lasting relationships would allow <b>credit</b> <b>intermediaries</b> to reduce {{the costs associated with}} moral hazard and adverse selection (Fama and Jensen 1983; James 1987; Fudenberg et al. 1990). Thus, the greater creation of value within the credit relationship consists in the activities of constant selection and control carried out by the bank towards credit applicants.|$|R
50|$|The Mortgage Credit Directive {{provides}} harmonised {{rules as}} regards the fields of knowledge and competence that creditors, <b>credit</b> <b>intermediaries</b> and appointed representatives’ staff should possess {{in order to achieve}} a high level of professionalism. Member States should provide adequate monitoring to ensure that these knowledge- and competence requirements are applied. In addition, the Directive states that Member States should promote measures to support the education of mortgage customers in order to increase his or her ability to make an informed decision.|$|R
30|$|However, {{the current}} crisis and the {{consequent}} increase {{in the frequency of}} default events, not only of entire entrepreneurial systems but also of entire countries, should lead larger <b>credit</b> <b>intermediaries</b> {{to pay more attention to}} relationship lending, investing more decisively in the collection of qualitative information on their customers in debt. By coordinating only this activity of soft information collection and by constantly developing quantitative models for the assessment of hard information, an improvement in the quality of customer portfolios may be achieved, stabilizing the credit market.|$|R

However, based on unrestricted VAR models, various interest rate shocks are simulated and it is found that the differences in the transmission effects are relatively small.

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, new types <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> {{institution}} have been developed and new forms of intermediation have succeeded in establishing themselves as important competitors in the credit market.

This study assess the importance of the management characteristics and profiles of quasi-banking institutions, for regulatory purposes, and to examine the relationship between the regulatory process and differing business behaviours. This study deals with a specific aspect of the regulation of financial systems. In any case, in the wide-ranging and animated discussions on regulation, recently there seems to be a growing interest in this specific issue, in respect of both the tendency towards the harmonization of regulations and of the extension of forms of control to sectors and/or activities which had previously been excluded. The paper also discusses the ideal design for an empirical investigation to analyse: 1) the management and organization structures of quasi-banks and their differing characteristics and behaviours, in respect of the regulatory process; 2) if the recent development of controls ensure competitive equality among the financial institutions. The empirical investigation has focused on factoring institutions and identified some behavioural differences which are relevant for the supervisory authorities...|$|R
