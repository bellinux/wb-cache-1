He hears stories about some of Odysseus's journey. Athena's push for Telemachos's journey helps him grow into the man role, that his father once held. She also {{plays a role in}} ending the {{resultant}} feud against the suitors' relatives. She instructs Laertes to throw his spear and to kill Eupeithes, the father of Antinous.|$|E
25|$|Later, Jaypaw convinces Lionpaw and Hollypaw {{that they}} need to find Sol <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> the prophecy. They find him outside of the territories in an {{abandoned}} Twoleg nest, different from the one on ThunderClan territory, and Sol tells them all he knows. On the way back, they get caught by a ShadowClan patrol and Sol goes to Blackstar and tells the three apprentices {{that he was going to}} stay in ShadowClan. In the time between then and the next Gathering, it seems that Sol has convinced Blackstar and his clan to stop believing in StarClan. Sol and Blackstar arrive at the Gathering together and Blackstar announces he has lost faith in StarClan and won't attend Gatherings anymore.|$|E

500|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{investigate}} {{the murder of}} Angela Frandina, who was found strangled in her bed clutching a note reading, [...] "Ed did it", although it proves to be a false lead. Their investigation leads the detectives to discover Angela had several strange boyfriends and worked at an S fashion store and a phone sex hotline. The two detectives visit the Eastern Shores Marketing Phone Sex operation where they speak with the manager, Ed. [...] Ed tells them about a boyfriend of Angela's named Chris Novoselic (Dan Garrett) who used {{to spend time with}} her at an S club called 'The Eve of Destruction' on Fayette Street. [...] Pembleton and Bayliss go to the Eve of Destruction to question Novoselic. [...] During questioning, Bayliss gets angry and loses his cool with Novoselic slamming the leather-clad, multi-pierced freak against the wall telling him that if he doesn't start giving them some answers, he is gonna slap some cuffs on him, take him downtown and knock him around' whereby Novoselic responds by telling Bayliss, 'If you do that, I might have to kiss you!'. [...] Pembleton calms Bayliss and they leave. [...] While driving, Bayliss claims to be disgusted by the sexual taboos, but Pembleton insists everybody has a darker side and that until Bayliss recognizes his own, his virtues can never truly be tested. Pembleton and Bayliss return to the S fashion store <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> leather belts with bead patterns matching the marks on Angela's neck. Store owner Tanya (Adrienne Shelly) tells them Angela's neighbor Jeremy (Scott Nielson) has a jacket with a matching belt. After an interrogation, Jeremy confesses to choking and accidentally killing Angela with the belt during quirky and violent (but consensual) sex. As a thank you for solving the case, Tanya brings Bayliss a leather jacket as gift, which he reluctantly accepts. That night, Bayliss visits Baltimore's red light district wearing the jacket, as a way to test himself as Pembleton suggested. He is approached by a prostitute but rejects her, thus passing the test.|$|E

40|$|Two random repeat recall {{methods were}} {{compared}} with a summary measure to assess alcohol use.

Follow-up telephone interviews obtained summary measures for each wave. Random repeat methods generally obtained higher estimates. However, the high dropout rate makes questionable the feasibility of using this approach with general population samples...|$|R

60|$|When {{the white}} man came the {{continent}} was nearly as poor, in variety of vegetation, as the desert of Sahara; now it has everything that grows on the earth.

If you see a curious or beautiful tree or bush or flower, <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> it, the people, answering, usually name a foreign country as the place of its origin--India, Africa, Japan, China, England, America, Java, Sumatra, New Guinea, Polynesia, and so on.|$|E
60|$|At all events, as I say, I gave no sign to Ambrose Tester that I {{understood}} him, that I guessed what {{he wished}} to come to. He got no satisfaction out of me that day; it is very true that he made up for it later. I expressed regret at Lord Vandeleur's illness, inquired into its nature and origin, hoped it would n't prove as grave as might be feared, said I would call at the house <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> him, commiserated discreetly her ladyship, and in short gave my young man no chance whatever. He knew that I had guessed his arrière-pensée, but he let me off for the moment, for which I was thankful; either because he was still ashamed of it, or because he supposed I was reserving myself for the catastrophe,--should it occur. Well, my dear, it did occur, {{at the end of}} ten days. Mr. Tester came to see me twice in that interval, each time to tell me that poor Vandeleur was worse; he had some internal inflammation which, in nine cases out of ten, is fatal. His wife was all devotion; she was with him night and day. I had the news from other sources as well; I leave you to imagine whether in London, {{at the height of the}} season, such a situation could fail to be considerably discussed. To the discussion as yet, however, I contributed little, and with Ambrose Tester nothing at all. I was still on my guard. I never admitted for a moment that it was possible there should be any change in his plans. By this time, I think, he had quite ceased to be ashamed of his idea, he was in a state almost of exaltation about it; but he was very angry with me for not giving him an opening.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Dyer was bubbling, [...] "Oh, {{have you}} folks {{heard about this}} young fellow that's just come to town that the boys call 'Elizabeth'? He's working in Nat Hicks's tailor shop. I bet he doesn't make {{eighteen}} a week, but my! isn't he the perfect lady though! He talks so refined, and oh, the lugs he puts on--belted coat, and pique collar with a gold pin, and socks to match his necktie, and honest--you won't believe this, but I got it straight--this fellow, you know he's staying at Mrs. Gurrey's punk old boarding-house, and they say he asked Mrs. Gurrey if he ought {{to put on a}} dress-suit for supper! Imagine! Can you beat that? And him nothing but a Swede tailor--Erik Valborg his name is. But he used to be in a tailor shop in Minneapolis (they do say he's a smart needle-pusher, at that) and he tries to let on that he's a regular city fellow. They say he tries to make people think he's a poet--carries books around and pretends to read 'em. Myrtle Cass says she met him at a dance, and he was mooning around all over the place, and he asked her did she like flowers and poetry and music and everything; he spieled like he was a regular United States Senator; and Myrtle--she's a devil, that girl, ha! ha!--she kidded him along, and got him going, and honest, what d'you think he said? He said he didn't find any intellectual companionship in this town. Can you BEAT it? Imagine! And him a Swede tailor! My! And they say he's the most awful mollycoddle--looks just like a girl. The boys call him 'Elizabeth,' and they stop him <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> the books he lets on to have read, and he goes and tells them, and they take it all in and jolly him terribly, and he never gets onto the fact they're kidding him.
