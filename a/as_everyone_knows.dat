In Test matches, he took 16 wickets {{at an average of}} 25.18 and scored 62 runs at an average of 8.85 with a top-score of 16. Following the team's return home, Bosanquet wrote an article giving his impressions of the tour for Wisden. The main Wisden report stated: [...] "Bosanquet's value with the ball cannot be judged from the averages, as on his bad days he is, <b>as</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>knows,</b> {{one of the most expensive}} of living bowlers. When he was in form the Australians thought him far more difficult on hard wickets than any of the other bowlers, Clement Hill saying, without any qualification, that his presence in the eleven won the rubber." ...|$|E

[...] In another article for the New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis further argues that, [...] " [...] is accustomed to having her abilities overlooked [...] When tragedy strikes, and Grace channels her grief into a resolution to play on the all-male varsity team, even her best friend is horrified. <b>As</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>knows,</b> only lesbians play soccer." ...|$|E

Woolcock's cousin, Elizabeth Snell, suggested to the doctor that <b>as</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> Woolcock's wife had been getting [...] "Morphia" [...] she could have poisoned him with it and rumours of foul play began spreading. Dr Dickie ordered an inquest largely to quash the rumours as he still believed his original diagnosis was correct.|$|R
2500|$|On 10 October 1881, {{during its}} {{original}} run, Patience {{transferred to the}} new Savoy Theatre, the first public building in the world lit entirely by electric light. Carte explained why he had introduced electric light: [...] "The greatest drawbacks to the enjoyment of the theatrical performances are, undoubtedly, the foul air and heat which pervade all theatres. [...] <b>As</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>knows,</b> each gas-burner consumes as much oxygen as many people, and causes great heat beside. The incandescent lamps consume no oxygen, and cause no perceptible heat." [...] When the electrical system was ready for full operation, in December 1881, Carte stepped on stage to demonstrate {{the safety of the}} new technology by breaking a glowing lightbulb before the audience.|$|E
2500|$|Director Gareth Edwards {{has said}} that he [...] "intentionally placed humans in shots to give the scene a sense of scale, <b>as</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> the size of a human, so we know the size of a {{creature}} or a building." [...] He has also claimed that [...] "We said that we wouldn't place a camera anywhere {{it would be impossible to}} get one. We would say [...] "Imagine it was a news story, or a sports event, cameramen would put cameras where they could in a hurry, and get any shot they could." [...] This is what we wanted [...] to feel like, as if people were filming glimpses at any chance they could." [...] He also found himself [...] "Doing things [...] think are cliche; panning up just as a roar happens, or getting the perfect shot, things I shake my head at when watching other people's films. Especially when [...] is first seen, we wanted a build up, and then pan up, we see him, and then we don't see him. I love that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Savoy, a {{state-of-the-art}} theatre in the City of Westminster, London, {{was the first}} public building in the world lit entirely by electricity. Swan supplied about 1,200 incandescent lamps, powered by an [...] generator on open land near the theatre. The builder of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte, explained why he had introduced Swan's electric light: [...] "The greatest drawbacks to the enjoyment of the theatrical performances are, undoubtedly, the foul air and heat which pervade all theatres. <b>As</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>knows,</b> each gas-burner consumes as much oxygen as many people, and causes great heat beside. The incandescent lamps consume no oxygen, and cause no perceptible heat." [...] The first generator proved too small to power the whole building, and though the entire front-of-house was electrically lit, the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881. At that performance, Carte stepped onstage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of Swan's new technology. On 29 December 1881, The Times described the electric lighting as superior, visually, to gaslight.|$|E
50|$|Episodes {{were mostly}} filmed {{in front of}} a live studio {{audience}} at Teddington Studios in London Borough of Richmond upon Thames on Wednesday evenings. Sue Vertue says that the live audience reinvigorated the company because no one had laughed at the material for a few days <b>as</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> it so well. A warm-up comedian updated the studio audiences about any important plot detail, introduced them to the performers, and provided entertainment while cameras and sets were being repositioned. Rob Rouse fulfilled this role for the fourth series.|$|R

I saw Goethe's house, Schiller's statue, and Dannecker's famous 'Ariadne.' It was very lovely, but I should have enjoyed it more if I had known the story better. I didn't like to ask, <b>as</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> it or pretended they did. I wish Jo would tell me all about it.

2500|$|The Savoy was a {{state-of-the-art}} theatre {{and the first}} public building {{in the world to}} be lit entirely by electricity. In 1881, Sir Joseph Swan, inventor of the incandescent light bulb, supplied about 1,200 Swan incandescent lamps, and the lights were powered by a [...] generator on open land near the theatre.

The Times described the electric lighting as superior, visually, to gaslight. Gaslights were installed as a backup, but they rarely had to be used. The Times concluded that the theatre [...] "is admirably adapted for its purpose, its acoustic qualities are excellent, and all reasonable demands of comfort and taste are complied with." [...] Carte and his manager, George Edwardes (later famous as manager of the Gaiety Theatre), introduced several innovations including numbered seating, free programme booklets, good quality whisky in the bars, the [...] "queue" [...] system for the pit and gallery (an American idea) and a policy of no tipping for cloakroom or other services. Daily expenses at the theatre were about half the possible takings from ticket sales.|$|E

A year before she had approved of Bertha's rejection of Frank, but since then much had happened. Bertha had shown that she would not marry for position only, and that she would be likely to take her own way entirely in the matter; and, although this was a downfall to the hopes that she had once entertained, Lady Greendale was herself very fond of Frank, and it was at any rate better than having Bertha marry a man of whose real means she was ignorant, and who, <b>as</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>knew,</b> bet heavily on the turf.

30|$|A {{different}} mismatch {{pertains to}} decision-making biases in organizations. In an ancestral environment {{with plenty of}} dangers, humans evolved psychological mechanisms to make fast decisions. A decision rule such as “follow the individual that appears confident” was usually backed up by information about a person’s competence <b>as</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>knew</b> each other well. Yet in modern organizations, competence information is often lacking about managers and CEOs and so, people tend to mistake cues of confidence for competence. This then selects for leaders who are overconfident, but not necessarily competent in their decision-making (Van Vugt and Ronay, 2014). Selection and feedback methods that raise the awareness of biases in leader decision-making may prevent these errors. Other biases (Kahneman, 2011) such as loss aversion, fundamental attribution error, or the inability to make probability judgments—thinking in terms of percentages rather than in absolute numbers—could also be interpreted as adaptive heuristics that were perfectly fitted to ancestral environments, but work less well in modern environments (Nicholson, 1997).|$|R

Even in these days, when we are sated with horrors, he could hardly have permitted his mother and sister to be executed when, <b>as</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>knew,</b> he had power to save them.

5000|$|Similarly, {{at the end}} of {{the cartoon}} when all of the Japanese were locked in the cage they resembled {{squealing}} mice which could represent their naturally higher pitched voices. The weakness of Japanese equipment and ships is also represented when Popeye is able to use part of the railing like a tin opener to destroy the battleship. The cloud that the Japanese sailor was hidden behind could also represent how good the Japanese were at camouflaging themselves especially when they were in jungle environments. Similarly, it could be a symbol for their cunning and cowardice, attacking from a cover. It could also reference the surprise attack on Pearl Harbour as it could be argued they used there cunning there as well.
