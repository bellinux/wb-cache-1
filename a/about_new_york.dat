5|$|The tower has {{a three-story}} {{observation}} deck, located on floors 100–102, {{in addition to}} existing broadcast and antenna facilities. Similar to the Empire State Building, visitors are separated from the tenants, having their own separate entrance next to the museum, descending down to a below-ground security screening area. On the observation deck, the actual viewing space is on the 100th floor, {{but there is a}} food court on the 101st floor and a space for events for the 102nd floor. To show visitors the city, and give them information and stories <b>about</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> an interactive tool called City Pulse is used by Tour Ambassadors. The admission fee is $32 per person, but admission discounts are available for children and seniors, and the deck is free for 9/11 responders and families of 9/11 victims. When it opens, the deck is expected to have about 3.5 million visitors per year. Tickets went on sale starting on April 8. However, the Manhattan District Attorney probed the Port Authority about the firm to which it awarded a contract to operate the deck. It officially opened on May 28, 2015, one day ahead of schedule.|$|E

In an article <b>about</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City's daily newspapers that year, The Atlantic Monthly found the newspaper's [...] "financial pages … execrable, its news columns readable but utterly commonplace, and its rubber-stamping of Republican policies (making) it the last sheet in town operated as a servant of party machinery".|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} Imus was suspended.

Comedian Bill Maher said that if a comedian apologizes for stepping over a line, that should suffice. Steve Adubato, an MSNBC media analyst, disagreed, saying that this incident was [...] "not isolated". Joe Klein made the same charge, referring to Imus's comment <b>about</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Times reporter Gwen Ifill 14 years before as evidence of a pattern of offensive comments. On The View, Rosie O'Donnell spoke out in support of keeping Imus on the air on free speech grounds, while Emil Steiner of The Washington Post argued that Al Sharpton used the issue to further divide America along racial lines.|$|E
2500|$|Abbott's ideas <b>about</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> {{were highly}} {{influenced}} by Lewis Mumford's historical writings {{from the early}} 1930s, which divided American history {{into a series of}} technological eras. [...] Abbott, like Mumford, was particularly critical of America's [...] "paleotechnic era," [...] which, as he described it, emerged at end of the American Civil War, a development called by other historians the Second Industrial Revolution. [...] Like Mumford, Abbott was hopeful that, through urban planning efforts (aided by her photographs), Americans would be able to wrest control of their cities from paleotechnic forces, and bring about what Mumford described as a more humane and human-scaled, [...] "neotechnic era". [...] Abbott's agreement with Mumford can be seen especially in the ways that she photographed buildings that had been constructed in the paleotechnic era—before the advent of urban planning. [...] Most often, buildings from this era appear in Abbott's photographs in compositions that made them look downright menacing.|$|E
