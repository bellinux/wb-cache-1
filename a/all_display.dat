500|$|The art during Ahmose I's reign {{was similar}} to the Middle Kingdom royal Theban style, and stelae from this period were once more of the same quality. This {{reflects}} a possibly natural conservative tendency to revive fashions from the pre-Hyksos era.

[...] Alternative Addiction also ranked the song at number 11 on the Top 50 Songs of 2005. Jim Campbell of Playback wrote that [...] "the standout tracks (“Attack,” “A Beautiful Lie,” “The Kill”) all exude the same strong elements: interesting lyrics, sweeping vocals, and a pulsing rhythm section. They <b>all</b> <b>display</b> a remarkable amount of musical maturity and charisma." [...] Mike Horvath of The Sheaf praised the keyboard effects and guitar distortions of the song, and Stuff listed the song {{as one of the}} top tracks from the album. Landon Christensen from Davis Enterprise felt that the song [...] "is pretty catchy, with a cool keyboard pattern and Leto's impressive vocals." [...] Jonathan Love of The Decatur Daily wrote that [...] "Attack" [...] "is an expression of rebirth featuring energetic keyboards, abrasive guitars and addictive vocals, which range from a pain-stricken wail to an intimate whisper." [...] Jason Silverstein from The Buffalo News felt that [...] "songs like 'The Kill,' 'Attack' and 'The Fantasy' show a little bit of the old school sound, and also how the new sound should have worked." [...] Connie Phillips from Blogcritics commented that the song [...] "is a digital extravaganza of synthesizers which gives way to Leto's powerful vocals. Though he occasionally moves to the screaming that is ever present in today's heavy music, he doesn't cheat on the vocals. For the most part, it is very melodic and his voice is commanding. What he is delivering with that voice is potent as well. The lyrics are intricate and nearly poetic. This song is a driven expression of endings and new beginnings. The deep seated emotions cross both sides of the spectrum, rage filled and mournful." [...] Zone placed [...] "Attack" [...] at number 52 on the 210 Most Played Songs of the 2000s.|$|E

2500|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} Gârbea's main works is the reliance on intertextuality, as compliments to his predecessors in drama, novel and poetry. Speaking in 2009, Gârbea himself recalled his stylistic discovery of the 1980s: [...] "It still {{seemed to me that}} being a writer meant having visions and struggling to communicate them so that others may have them too. [...] I could not write prose, but I enjoyed writing drama because I had invented something very fun to do: old characters in new situations." [...] Poet and critic Octavian Soviany noted: [...] "Horia Gârbea is a dramatist who builds with a program in mind, placing his stake on the resources of parody and the intertextual play. The parodic here is given birth by the disabused conscience of a postmodern spirit, who knows that all books have been written and therefore only their 'rewriting' [...] is still possible". Commenting on the texts grouped within Cine l-a ucis pe Marx?, literary critic Mircea A. Diaconu placed the intertextual references (which often make a point of transgressing historical reality) in connection with William Shakespeare's phrase [...] "All the world's a stage", since [...] "everything is possible {{at the level of the}} text becoming reality". He praises the author for managing to preserve an [...] "absence that imposes", by not making his own intervention felt in the text. Diaconu admits that such an approach could be read as [...] "gratuitously bookish, [...] a line is more important than an event, a pun more important than a murder", but supports the notion that they <b>all</b> <b>display</b> an [...] "existential bearing", accounting for an [...] "intrinsic value." [...] He speaks of the technique as [...] "a vengeance of the theater" [...] on the traditional historical record: [...] "In essence, Horia Gârbea's theater emerges from the textual inconsistency of the world when faced with the consistency of history, or, better yet, from the inconsistency of history and the textual consistency of the world." ...|$|E

60|$|As {{time went}} on Nero's {{confidence}} in his British guard steadily increased. He had his spies, and knew how entirely Beric kept himself aloof from intimate acquaintanceship with any save the family of Norbanus, and learned, too, that he had refused many large bribes from suitors. For a time, although he knew it not, Beric was constantly watched. His footsteps were followed when he went abroad, his conversations {{with others in the}} baths, which formed the great centres of meeting, and stood to the Romans in the place of modern clubs, were listened to and noted. It was observed that he seldom went to convivial gatherings, and that at any place when the conversation turned on public affairs he speedily withdrew; that he avoided <b>all</b> <b>display</b> of wealth, dressed as quietly as it was possible for one in the court circle to do, and bore himself as simply as when he had been training in the ludus of Scopus. There he still went very frequently, practising constantly in arms with his former companions, preferring this to the more formal exercises of the gymnasium. Thus, after a time, Nero became confirmed in his opinion of Beric's straightforward honesty, and felt that there was no fear of his being tampered with by his enemies.|$|E

6000|$|Our artist {{loves to}} joke at a soldier; in whose livery {{there appears to}} him to be {{something}} almost as ridiculous as in the uniform of the gentleman of the shoulder-knot. Tall life-guardsmen and fierce grenadiers figure in many of his designs, and almost always in a ridiculous way. Here again we have the honest popular English feeling which jeers at pomp or pretension of all kinds, and is especially jealous of <b>all</b> <b>display</b> of military authority. [...] "Raw Recruit," [...] "ditto dressed," [...] ditto [...] "served up," [...] as we {{see them in the}} [...] "Sketch-Book," [...] are so many satires upon the army: Hodge with his ribbons flaunting in his hat, or with red coat and musket, drilled stiff and pompous, or at last, minus leg and arm, tottering about on crutches, does not fill our English artist with the enthusiasm that follows the soldier in every other part of Europe. Jeanjean, the conscript in France, is laughed at to be sure, but then it is because he is a bad soldier: when he comes to have a huge pair of mustachios and the croix-d'honneur to briller on his poitrine cicatrisee, Jeanjean becomes a member of a class that is more respected than any other in the French nation. The veteran soldier inspires our people with no such awe--we hold that democratic weapon the fist in much more honor than the sabre and bayonet, and laugh at a man tricked out in scarlet and pipe-clay.|$|E
60|$|Such are, I believe, {{the three}} {{principal}} kinds of fallacy by which architecture {{is liable to}} be corrupted; there are, however, other and more subtle forms of it, against which it is less easy to guard by definite law, than by the watchfulness of a manly and unaffected spirit. For, {{as it has been}} above noticed, there are certain kinds of deception which extend to impressions and ideas only; of which some are, indeed, of a noble use, as that above referred to, the arborescent look of lofty Gothic aisles; but of which the most part have so much of legerdemain and trickery about them, that they will lower any style in which they considerably prevail; and they are likely to prevail when once they are admitted, being apt to catch the fancy alike of uninventive architects and feelingless spectators; just as mean and shallow minds are, in other matters, delighted with the sense of over-reaching, or tickled with the conceit of detecting the intention to over-reach; and when subtleties of this kind are accompanied by the display of such dextrous stone-cutting, or architectural sleight of hand, as may become, even by itself, a subject of admiration, it is a great chance if the pursuit of them do not gradually draw us away from all regard and care for the nobler character of the art, and end in its total paralysis or extinction. And against this there is no guarding, but by stern disdain of <b>all</b> <b>display</b> of dexterity and ingenious device, and by putting the whole force of our fancy into the arrangement of masses and forms, caring no more how these masses and forms are wrought out, than a great painter cares which way his pencil strikes. It would be easy to give many instances of the danger of these tricks and vanities; but I shall confine myself to the examination of one which has, as I think, been the cause of the fall of Gothic architecture throughout Europe. I mean the system of intersectional mouldings, which, on account of its great importance, {{and for the sake of}} the general reader, I may, perhaps, be pardoned for explaining elementarily.|$|E
60|$|Here {{and there}} you may see driving past with its mother in an open barouche, or parading the Rue de la Paix on the hand of its nurse, the doll-like {{substitute}} for old-time infancy, the fashionable Parisian child. As far as the sex can be determined by looking at it, it is generally a girl. It is dressed in the height of fashion. A huge picture hat reaches out in all directions from its head. Long gloves encase its little arms {{to prevent it from}} making a free use of them. A dainty coat of powder on its face preserves it from the distorting effect of a smile. Its little hundred dollar frock reaches down in a sweet simplicity of outline. It has a belt that runs round its thighs to divide it into two harmonious parts. Below that are bare pink legs ending in little silk socks at a dollar an inch and wee slippers clasped with a simple emerald buckle. Therein, of course, the child only obeys the reigning fashion. Simplicity,--so I am informed by the last number of La Mode Parisienne,--is the dominant note of Parisian dress to-day,--simplicity, plainness, freedom from <b>all</b> <b>display.</b> A French lady wears in her hair at the Opera a single, simple tiara bound with a plain row of solitaire diamonds. It is so exquisitely simple in its outline that you can see the single diamonds sticking out from it and can count up the price of each. The Parisian gentleman wears in his button-hole merely a single orchid,--not half a dozen,--and pins his necktie with one plain, ordinary ruby, set in a perfectly unostentatious sunburst of sapphires. There is no doubt of the superiority of this Parisian simplicity. To me, when it broke upon me in reading La Mode Parisienne, it came as a kind of inspiration. I took away the stuffy black ribbon with its stupidly elaborate knot from my Canadian Christie hat and wound a single black ostrich feather about it fastened with just the plainest silver aigrette. When I had put that on and pinned a piece of old lace to the tail of my coat with just one safety pin, I walked the street with the quiet dignity of a person whose one idea is not to be conspicuous.|$|E
