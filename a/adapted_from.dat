50|$|The eye takes {{approximately}} 20-30 {{minutes to}} fully <b>adapt</b> <b>from</b> bright sunlight to complete darkness and become 10,000 to 1,000,000 times {{more sensitive than}} at full daylight. In this process, the eye's perception of color changes as well (this is called the Purkinje effect). However, it takes approximately five minutes for the eye to <b>adapt</b> <b>from</b> darkness to bright sunlight. This is due to cones obtaining more sensitivity when first entering the dark {{for the first five}} minutes but the rods take over after five or more minutes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recently {{researchers}} have proposed activity recognition methods based on adapting activity knowledge obtained in previous spaces {{to a new}} space. Adapting activity knowledge allows us to quickly recognize activities in a new space using only small amounts of unlabeled data. However, <b>adapting</b> <b>from</b> dissimilar spaces not only does not help the recognition task, but might also lead to degraded recognition accuracy. We propose a method for automatically selecting the most promising source spaces {{among a number of}} available spaces. Our approach leads to a scalable and quick solution in real world, while minimizing the negative effects of <b>adapting</b> <b>from</b> dissimilar sources. To evaluate our algorithms, we tested our algorithms on eight real smart home datasets. ...|$|R

3000|$|The {{theory of}} the dynamic {{data-driven}} adaptation with complete sensor samples gives guidance on the selection of M^update. In case of complete sensor samples, setting M^update= l_A × n is sufficient to recover the reduced model that would be obtained via rebuilding from scratch [42]. Note that l_A = 4 {{is the number of}} μ-independent operators and n= 8 the dimension of the POD basis space. We set M^update= 5 × l_A × n= 160 since we <b>adapt</b> <b>from</b> incomplete sensor samples and therefore expect that the approximation of the missing values introduces additional error into the adaptation. In total, we receive M^'= M^basis+ M^update= 5160 incomplete sensor samples to <b>adapt</b> <b>from</b> η_i - 1 to η_i for i = 1, [...]..., 9.|$|R

50|$|Smoltification (also {{known as}} Parr-Smolt transformation) is {{the series of}} {{physiological}} changes where juvenile salmonid fish <b>adapt</b> <b>from</b> living in fresh water to living in seawater. Physiological changes during smoltification include altered body shape, increased skin reflectance (silvery colouration), and increased Na+/K+-ATPase in the gills. A number of mechanisms assist with osmoregulation.|$|R
50|$|Smoltification is {{the process}} of salmon <b>adapting</b> <b>from</b> {{freshwater}} to marine water. GM salmon can potentially achieve smolt size in only one year. This could allow AquAdvantage fish to reach the ocean quicker. The ability to reach the ocean first could allow GM salmon to access more food with less competition from wild-type salmon.|$|R
