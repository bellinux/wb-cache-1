5|$|Manning's lawyers {{argued that}} the {{government}} had overstated the harm the release of the documents had caused, and had overcharged Manning to force her to give evidence against Assange. The defense also raised questions about whether Manning's confusion over her gender identity <b>affected</b> <b>her</b> behavior and decision making.|$|E
5|$|McLeod fully transitioned to the Canadian senior {{national}} team following her {{performance at the}} U-19 World Championship. She has stated that the transition was difficult for her due to the great depth of goalkeepers already with the {{national team}}, noting she often took the back seat to more experienced players, which <b>affected</b> <b>her</b> confidence.|$|E

5|$|On 11 January 2006, Venerable Ho died peacefully in {{her sleep}} at the Man Fut Tong Nursing Home, at about 9:30pm, just one month before turning 98. Until being {{hospital}}ised in November 2005, she had cooked for and looked after herself and played {{an active role in}} running both the temple and the nursing home. During her hospital stay, she suffered a stroke, which <b>affected</b> <b>her</b> speech and paralysed the left side of her body. Discharged in December 2005, she was recuperating well at the nursing home until she developed a chest infection and breathing difficulties a few days before she died.|$|E
5|$|The {{death in}} 1986 of {{her younger sister}} Felicité, {{who had lived in}} the top floor of her house for thirty years, was a severe blow to David. She began to suffer from {{depression}} and went to the doctor after suffering chest pains; he diagnosed tuberculosis and she was hospitalised. After a torrid time over a three-month stay in hospital, where the drugs she was prescribed had side-effects that <b>affected</b> <b>her</b> clarity of thinking, her friend, the wine importer and writer Gerald Asher, arranged for her to stay with him in California to recuperate.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of battle damage and casualties, Langsdorff decided to put into Montevideo, where repairs could be {{effected}} and the wounded men could be evacuated from the ship. Most of the hits scored by the British cruisers caused only minor structural and superficial damage but the oil purification plant, which was required to prepare the diesel fuel for the engines, was destroyed. Her desalination plant and galley were also destroyed, which would have increased the difficulty {{of a return to}} Germany. A hit in the bow would also have negatively <b>affected</b> <b>her</b> seaworthiness in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Admiral Graf Spee had fired much of her ammunition in the engagement with Harwood's cruisers.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, Kuzmich's strong {{portfolio}} {{could not}} compensate for her Asperger syndrome, which began to <b>affect</b> <b>her</b> when having {{to communicate with}} others. During week nine, a runway challenge requiring her to speak caused her to freeze {{up in front of}} the audience and negatively <b>affect</b> <b>her</b> shoot with a burning car in the desert. Tyra Banks noted that while it was a good shot, it was her weakest.|$|R

5|$|Clarke {{sold the}} Stradivarius {{she had been}} bequeathed, and {{established}} the May Muklé prize at the Royal Academy. The prize is still awarded annually to an outstanding cellist. After her husband's death in 1967, Clarke began writing a memoir, entitled I Had a Father Too (or the Mustard Spoon); it was completed in 1973 but never published. In it she describes her early life, marked by frequent beatings from her father and strained family relations which <b>affected</b> <b>her</b> perceptions of her proper place in life. Clarke died in 1979 {{at her home in}} New York City at the age of 93, and was cremated.|$|E
5|$|Following the Olympics, Meissner {{returned}} to Baltimore. On the return flight, she partially ruptured {{one of her}} eardrums and fully ruptured the other. This <b>affected</b> <b>her</b> hearing as she trained for the 2006 World Championships, her first senior ISU Championship. At Worlds, Meissner placed second in her qualifying group and fifth in the short program, putting her in third place overall going into the free skate. During the free skate, Meissner completed seven triple jumps, including two triple-triple combinations, to win the title. This win made her the first woman since Kristi Yamaguchi to win a world title before a national title. Meissner is also {{the first woman to}} win Worlds on her first appearance since Oksana Baiul in 1993. She is the seventh-youngest ladies World Champion in history. Meissner has described this win as changing her career from being the underdog to being expected to win every competition she entered.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by the sudden death in 1977 of Jerry Slattery, her lover and confidant {{for more than a}} quarter of a century. Manning's last years were also made difficult by physical deterioration; arthritis increasingly <b>affected</b> <b>her,</b> leading to hip replacements in 1976 and in 1979 and she suffered poor health related to amoebic dysentery caught in the Middle East. Manning began work on the final novel in The Levant Trilogy, The Sum of Things, in which Harriet agrees to sail home to the UK, but having said goodbye to Guy, changes her mind. The novel describes Harriet's travels in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, observes Guy's supposed widowerhood in Cairo after he hears of the sinking of Harriet's ship, and follows Simon Boulderstone's injury during the battle of El Alamein and recovery.|$|E

5|$|River refuses the Doctor's {{offer to}} travel with him, {{returning}} to her Stormcage prison {{in order to keep}} a promise. She kisses the Doctor goodbye, and as the Doctor has never kissed her before she deduces that this will be her last kiss with him. In the TARDIS, Amy appears unable to remember seeing her picture in the orphanage and says that she told the Doctor, rather than Rory, when she believed she was pregnant, through fears that travelling in the TARDIS might have <b>affected</b> <b>her</b> child's development. As the trio sets off, the Doctor discreetly uses the TARDIS scanner to attempt to determine if Amy is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor assured Mary {{that he had}} {{no doubts}} about her loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church. He had learned that the Queen could not easily be bullied, {{especially}} not in matters which <b>affected</b> <b>her</b> personally. Yet, upon leaving the States General in October 1531, Charles gave her a warning, saying that if his parent, wife, child or sibling became a follower of Luther, he would consider them his greatest enemy. Mary was thus forced to suppress Protestantism in the Netherlands, regardless of her own religious tolerance. However, she always strived to enforce her brother's laws on religion as little as possible. She was accused of protecting Protestants on several occasions.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that some of Victoria's descendants did have mild porphyria (although some historians now think {{it could have been}} bi-polar disorder), most notably Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen. This disease may have <b>affected</b> <b>her</b> grandfather, George III and this could give credence to Victoria's legitimate birth. There is more reliable documentation that one of her great-great-grandsons, Prince William of Gloucester, was diagnosed with the disease shortly before his death when his aircraft crashed during an air race. Concrete evidence on the origins of the disease and paternity of Victoria could be achieved with a DNA test of her or her parents' remains, but no such study has been sanctioned by the Royal Family.|$|E

5|$|When news {{began to}} spread of Henry I's death, Matilda and Geoffrey were in Anjou, {{supporting}} the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda's supporters such as Robert of Gloucester. Many of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late king was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England. Nonetheless, Geoffrey and Matilda {{took the opportunity to}} march into southern Normandy and seize a number of key castles around Argentan that had formed Matilda's disputed dowry. They then stopped, unable to advance further, pillaging the countryside and facing increased resistance from the Norman nobility and a rebellion in Anjou itself. Matilda was by now also pregnant with her third son, William; opinions vary among historians as to what extent this <b>affected</b> <b>her</b> military plans.|$|E
5|$|According to Twain, {{she became}} {{depressed}} and lost {{her desire to}} live after the divorce. As a distraction, she began to write a memoir, titled From This Moment On after the 1998 song of the same name. She then re-evaluated her life and noted a pattern of withholding emotions, which <b>affected</b> <b>her</b> voice for both speaking and singing. She explained {{the loss of her}} voice resulted from the cumulative stress of experiencing domestic violence in her childhood, the death of her parents, stress from her musical career, and the divorce. As a result, the singer developed dysphonia, an impairment in the ability to produce sound because of tightened muscles enveloping her voice box. In order to recover, Twain embarked on a documented journey with the series Why Not? with Shania Twain. Twain's wanted go outside her comfort zone and perform once again, while inspiring viewers to be proactive about their own problems.|$|E
5|$|After the war Knight {{returned}} to her previous themes of the ballet, the circus and Gypsies, and continued to divide her time between London and Malvern. In 1948 Knight painted backstage at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, mostly observing {{the work of the}} wardrobe department, still working under austerity restrictions. The same year she painted a large group portrait of Princess Elizabeth and several civic dignitaries opening the new Broadgate Centre in Coventry. A period of illness <b>affected</b> <b>her</b> work on this commission, and, despite Knight's repainting large parts of the canvas, the finished painting was not well received. A major exhibition of over eighty works by Knight was held at the Ian Nicol Gallery in Glasgow, in 1952. The following year Knight {{returned to}} the theatre, painting and producing crayon studies, backstage at the Old Vic in London during the Birmingham Repertory Theatre's production of Henry IV, Part 1 & Part 2. Throughout this period Knight continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy each year, most notably with a portrait of Jean Rhodes, a professional strong woman known as 'The Mighty Mannequin', which when shown in 1955 led to further portrait commissions for Knight. In 1956 Knight worked backstage at the Royal Opera House during performances and rehearsals by the Bolshoi Ballet.|$|E
