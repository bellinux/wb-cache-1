25|$|The College uniform varies {{throughout}} the grades, these being between Years Prep–3, 4–6, 7–11 and 12. One defining factor of the uniform is the boater, <b>a</b> <b>straw</b> <b>hat</b> worn {{to and from}} the school and in public that has been a college tradition since its conception. In Years 4–6, the uniform consists of a green shirt, a green and black tie, grey shorts and plain grey socks.|$|E
25|$|The fair's mascots are two anthropomorphized gophers. Fairchild, the {{original}} mascot, was named by Gladys Anderson Brown for Henry S. Fairchild who advocated using the former Ramsey County Poor Farm as the permanent {{site of the}} fair. Dressed like an early barker on the midway with <b>a</b> <b>straw</b> <b>hat</b> and striped jacket, Fairchild has represented the fair for decades. In 1986, he was joined on promotional materials by his nephew, Fairborn.|$|E

Later she {{was honored}} by the United States Postal Service with a 23-cent Great Americans series postage stamp. In 2003, four of her paintings (Young Mother (1888), Children Playing on the Beach (1884), On a Balcony (1878/79) and Child in <b>a</b> <b>Straw</b> <b>Hat</b> (circa 1886)) were reproduced on the third issue in the American Treasures series.|$|E

25|$|Mother and {{daughter}} both wear long white sundresses. The elegant presentation, {{which also includes}} <b>a</b> <b>straw</b> <b>hat</b> for each and a parasol for the mother, {{is typical of the}} fashion of the time, around 1910. The 19-year-old Maria has a simple floor-length dress that emphasizes her slender silhouette. At the neck the dress is finished with a stand-up collar. The tight-fitting sleeves contrast {{with the rest of the}} dress, and are of a more transparent white cloth, through which shines the skin. Of similar fabric is an panel of cloth mounted below the chest on a large ring. The sea wind blows the cloth into arabesques behind the daughter. Under the dress appears a brown leather shoe; on its side reflections emphasize the smooth surface. In her right hand Maria holds a yellow straw hat with a wide, sweeping brim, decorated with purple colored flowers and a turquoise bow. She has pinned her brown hair into a knot, so that her face comes into its own.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor's {{clothing}} {{has been}} equally distinctive, from the distinguished Edwardian suits of the First Doctor to the Second Doctor's rumpled, clown-like Chaplinesque attire to the dandyish frills and velvet of the Third Doctor's era. The Fourth Doctor's long frock coat, loose fitting trousers, occasionally worn wide-brimmed hat and trailing, multi-striped scarf {{added to his}} somewhat shambolic and bohemian image; the Fifth's Edwardian cricketer's outfit suited his youthful, aristocratic air {{as well as his}} love of the sport (with a stick of celery on the lapel for an eccentric touch, though in The Caves of Androzani it is revealed to turn purple when exposed to gases the Doctor is allergic to); and the Sixth's multicoloured jacket, with its cat-shaped lapel pins, reflected the excesses of 1980s fashion. The Seventh Doctor's outfit – <b>a</b> <b>straw</b> <b>hat,</b> a coat with two scarves, a tie, checked trousers and brogues/wing-tips – was more subdued and suggestive of a showman, reflecting his whimsical approach to life. In later seasons, as his personality grew more mysterious, his jacket, tie and hatband all grew darker.|$|E
25|$|General {{interest}} magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, {{short stories}} and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One {{of them was the}} historically significant Collier's (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor William Chenery in 1925. Martin drew many of its covers during the Roaring Twenties, including seven in 1925 (twenty 1923–27). Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures. His recurring theme was of a youthful boy engaged in various lighthearted activities. This included the following: catching a baseball, loading up on desserts (pictured below), playing the flute, wearing <b>a</b> <b>straw</b> <b>hat,</b> shooting marbles, shoveling snow, carrying schoolbooks on head, riding a sled, winding up a toy, eating turkey at Christmas, bobbing for apples, playing football (pictured), happily swimming, getting a shaved haircut, saying grace, working as a messenger, daydreaming at school about fishing and going down a water slide. He seldom veered from this subject matter.|$|E

25|$|Membership has {{varied from}} the {{original}} nine banjo players to well over a hundred. It includes both banjo and gut bucket (washtub bass) players plus a Band Auxiliary. From its humble beginnings {{in the basement of}} the Cupertino Music Store, the PBB did not have an official public venue until 1966. Having outgrown the music store, a gentleman by the name of Ward Pinther offered to host the band at his Straw Hat Pizza Palace in Campbell, California. This hospitality lasted for the next 24 years until Pinther's retirement and the closing of the restaurant. Not to be deterred, the band moved to yet another Straw Hat Pizza restaurant in the nearby San Jose neighborhood of Willow Glen. So from 1966 until Tuesday, June 16, 2009, the band entertained crowds every Tuesday evening at <b>a</b> <b>Straw</b> <b>Hat</b> Pizza restaurant. During the band's heyday in the 1970s and 1980s, it was not unusual to have four rows of twenty to twenty five banjo players performing plus as many as eight gutbucket players and a tuba. The sound produced by a hundred or more banjos is unique and unlike anything else in the world of acoustic performances.|$|E
25|$|The figure {{behind the}} daughter, Clotilde Sorolla, also wears a white dress, her hips accented {{by a white}} belt. Thus both the breasts and the {{buttocks}} have clearer contours than the daughter's. Clothilde's dress has cropped sleeves, and she carries a jacket, also made of white fabric, on her left forearm {{in front of her}} abdomen. In her left hand she holds an open white parasol, which is angled to the ground on the left side. Under Clotilde's dress are two elegant white women's shoes with small heels. On her head Clotilde wears <b>a</b> <b>straw</b> <b>hat,</b> which is also decorated with purple colored flowers. In addition, a greenish-transparent veil is draped over the entire hat, and falls forward over her face and is blown backward almost horizontally in the wind. Clotilde has bent her right arm upward and her hand lies on the veil. This creates the impression that she must adjust it due to the wind veil or even hold it in place. Of the head of Clotilde little can be seen. Large parts of face, depicted in profile, are in shadow and only the chin is in brighter sunlight. Also, the wide sweeping hat obscures the hair almost completely. Just behind a pearl earring is a bit of dark hair. While the young face of the daughter Maria is looks directly into the sun, the face of the mother is hidden by the shadow of the hat. The clothes and accessories show the two women to be members of the upper class spending their free time in the summer with mild temperatures and light winds.|$|E
25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} two weeks later. It is midday, {{and the sun}} is scorching. Too hot to work, the mechanics, wearing {{sleeveless}} tank tops or stripped to their waists, laze around the garage and flirt with their girlfriends. Luca has taken Angelo under his wing and is teaching him how to fight. Unfortunately, Angelo shows little skill and continues to be the subject of the other mechanics' ridicule. Dino arrives, looking rather silly in <b>a</b> <b>straw</b> <b>hat,</b> Hawaiian shirt, Bermudas, and socks and sandals. Taking his briefcase, he leaves for a trip. Luca begins flirting with Lana, who is kneading dough for bread, and mutual seduction ensues. The mechanics and their partners also begin behaving lustily with increasing intensity. Lana leads Luca into her apartment with Dino above Dino's office. They make love, and Luca subsequently emerges dressed only in his underwear and an unbuttoned shirt, smoking a cigarette. He then re-enters the apartment and returns to Lana. Other couples lounge around the garage floor, apparently in post-coital bliss. Dino returns from his trip, and chases his workers and their friends away. He sees Lana through the apartment window and thinks she is waving at him, not realizing she is again making love to Luca with her hand pressed to the window. Dino ascends the metal staircase leading to the apartment, but trips and makes a clattering noise. Lana and Luca realize that Dino has returned. Just as Dino enters the apartment, Luca leaves by throwing his clothes out of another window and climbing down a fire escape. He dresses, but discovers that one of his boots is missing. Fortunately, Lana tosses the boot out of the window. Luca puts it on and walks away quickly. Angelo observes and follows him. Next, we see a car in the garage shaking as two people engage in sexual intercourse within. Luca emerges, buttoning his trousers, followed – unexpectedly – by Angelo. The expression on Angelo's face indicates he has fallen in love with Luca, and in parallel solos, both Lana and Angelo express joyous ecstasy at having encountered Luca that night.|$|E

500|$|The east window has {{scenes from}} Christ's {{betrayal}} and crucifixion, the Adoration of the Magi and Christ's return from Egypt with his family. [...] The {{top of the}} window uses glass fragments from a chapel commemorating Pope Adrian VI; he was tutor to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, whose head appears in the window, along with pictures of musical angels. [...] Other windows in the nave and chancel contain saints or depictions of incidents in Christ's life (including one of Jesus wearing <b>a</b> <b>straw</b> <b>hat</b> after his resurrection, said to be [...] "very rare").|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve the}} tightly wound curls fashionably {{inspired}} by Greek art, {{some of the}} actresses wore wigs while others employed heated hair twists and slept in pin curls. Fanny, the snobbiest of the characters, possesses the tightest of curls but has less of a Greek silhouette, a reflection of her wealth and silliness. Beavan stated that Fanny and Mrs. Jennings [...] "couldn't quite give up the frills," [...] and instead draped themselves in lace, fur, feathers, jewellery, and rich fabrics. Conversely, sensible Elinor opts for simpler accessories, such as a long gold chain and <b>a</b> <b>straw</b> <b>hat.</b> Fanny's shallow personality is also reflected in [...] "flashy, colourful" [...] dresses, while Edward's buttoned-up appearance represents his [...] "repressed" [...] personality, with little visible skin. Each of the 100 extras used in the London ballroom scene, depicting [...] "soldiers and lawyers to fops and dowagers," [...] don visually distinct costumes.|$|E
500|$|Tréhot began {{modeling}} for Renoir {{when she}} was about eighteen and he was twenty-five. Early paintings of Tréhot at this time include Lise in <b>a</b> <b>Straw</b> <b>Hat</b> (1866) and Lise Sewing (1867–68). Renoir painted a modern nude of Tréhot as Diana (1867), but it was rejected by the Salon of 1867. Renoir found critical success the next year with Lise (1867), which was well received at the Salon of 1868. [...] The Impressionist painting depicts Tréhot in a life-size portrait, strolling through a wooded park as sunlight falls through the trees. Art critic Zacharie Astruc described Tréhot in Lise as [...] "the likeable Parisian girl in the woods", and as a working-class girl. Émile Zola also approved, comparing Tréhot to Monet's model and later wife Camille Doncieux. French art critic Théodore Duret later observed that because Renoir's Lise was derivative of Gustave Courbet's technique, [...] its appearance at the Salon [...] "provoked no definite opposition". [...] However, Renoir's decision to shadow Tréhot's face in darkness and emphasize the reflection of sunlight from her white dress in Lise led several critics to ridicule Tréhot's appearance due to the unusual contrast.|$|E

500|$|Benjamin Champney was {{a master}} at {{painting}} water and is known for warm autumn colors. William F. Paskell (18661951), in his later style, used broad brushstrokes and bright colors to create an impressionistic feeling. George McConnell (18521929) was known for the velvety pastel look of his paintings. Edward Hill often created a canopy-like depiction of trees to frame and accentuate {{the focus of a}} painting, a technique that gave many of his works a feeling of intimacy and solitude. [...] Many of the works of Samuel Lancaster Gerry (18131891) included dogs, people on horseback, and women and men in red clothing. Francis Seth Frost (18251902) was known to use small figures, wispy clouds, and an oval format. Alfred Thompson Bricher (18371908) was known for his quiet, calm water. Sylvester Phelps Hodgdon (18301906) painted at the extremes of the day – sunrise and sunset scenes – and often in Franconia Notch. John White Allen Scott (1815–1907) frequently painted passing storm clouds in his skies. Frank Henry Shapleigh had his own primitive style and used the same [...] "props" [...] {{over and over again in}} his paintings. [...] He is known for painting landscapes as seen from the inside of a house or barn looking out through an open door or window. [...] Inside the room would be such props as a ladder back chair, a cat, a basket, <b>a</b> <b>straw</b> <b>hat,</b> a broom, and/or a tall clock.|$|E
