40|$|Because of its {{fascination with}} safety and control, Dutch {{society at the}} end of the twentieth century became subject to fear for the unknown. Panic and terror {{overpowered}} society, and imprisoned it into a permanent state of institutional living. The proposed alternative for this development is to revalue and restate the achievement of todays society. The valuation of the panoptic and polycentric model helps to propose a positive perspective in dealing with the institutionalised living. The historical precedents of institutionalised living in Dutch society show the continuity of the issue, and help to relativize the current situation. As Schama stated, seeing what distinguished insiders from outsiders is one way of defining the limiting perimeter of the culture itself. The paper discusses this distinction in the seventeenth century Dutch city. The network of institutions that dealt with outsiders proofed to be a humane and relatively peaceful way to bridge the gap between insiders and outsiders. By looking at the <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> <b>centre,</b> which is a result of the way the Dutch deal with outsiders nowadays, the perimeters of contemporary Dutch culture are explored to a certain degree. The establishment of asylum seekers centres as alien and unwanted centralised institutions in the outskirts of the Dutch landscape has mostly been defined by fear for the unknown. This has partly contributed to an increasing polarisation of insiders and outsiders in Dutch society. Architecture, as an object that manifests the type of distinction between insiders and outsiders, and the models and processes underlying the realization of architecture, play an important role in the manifestation of this polarisation. In the reflexive period of a temporary declining pressure on the asylum seekers centres, by a declining number of admitted refugees, other ways of dealing with outsiders should be considered. The architectural design project is an alternative proposal for an <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> <b>centre,</b> as a polycentric, anticlave network of institutionalised housing. The project tries to normalise the dwelling situation of asylum seekers as much as possible. It does so by dividing the common <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> <b>centre</b> into many small parts that interweave in an existing urban fabric. History has taught us that outsiders are relatively well integrated in a polycentric network of institutions. Today the polycentric network could again serve as a model in order to deal with the housing of asylum seekers. The limiting perimeters of the Dutch culture are in this project redefined, restated, and extended. Architectur...|$|E
40|$|My {{original}} {{contribution to the}} body of knowledge is a portfolio of evidence which includes: • An evaluation of Reache (Refugee and <b>Asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> <b>Centre</b> for Healthcare professionals Education) North West using a PEST (Political, Economic, Social and Technological) analysis and Thematic Content Analysis of semi-structured interviews which {{led to the development of}} the Reache North West model of education and training for refugee healthcare professionals. • The development of a course entitled Safe and Effective Clinical Communication Skills and the dissemination of this course via conference posters, oral presentations and a published journal article. In the case of the conference posters, the course was identified as good practice on two occasions. • A business case which led to the development of the Salford Communication and Language Assessment Resource (SCoLAR). This thesis analyses and critically appraises the action research, ideas, reports and publications, from 10 years of organizational experience. This also includes over ten years of personal experience teaching and managing education programmes for international students, and over four years of working with refugee healthcare professionals, assisting them in returning to their professional role in the UK. The evaluation of Reache North West sought to answer the research question ‘Are we effectively preparing refugee doctors for work in the NHS?’ Although there were only 5 respondents the evaluation answered this question positively. Also discussed is the process for the development of the safe and effective clinical communication course and the difficulty in this course to other groups of internationally trained doctors. My observations and experience of working with International Medical Graduates who have encountered language and communication difficulties are also discussed with the acknowledgement that more robust research processes are needed for future research...|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} a result of a field work in three <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> <b>centres</b> in Serbia. The author deals with migrant and refugee women's {{experiences}} on the western Balkan route. The methodology used is mainly semi-structured and un-structured interviews with migrants, employees in <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> <b>centres</b> and local inhabitants. The article examines the specific experiences of migrant and refugee women on their way into Europe. It focuses on the different forms of violence they face, on the experiences of pregnant women and on the changes to their situations during the mobility process. It further deals with the legislation concerning refugees and tries to show how legislation indirectly creates threats to women migrants {{while at the same time}} depriving them of power and victimizing them. It is based on understanding the legislature as a male-centred, which means that it is mainly shaped by experiences of men while often not examining the specific experiences and needs of women. The author notes that refugee women need to submit to the dominant representation of them as victims, even though there is a great deal of autonomy, solidarity and perseverance in the stories of the women interviewed...|$|R

40|$|Background The world's growing {{population}} of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> faces different health risks from {{the populations of}} their host countries because of risk factors before and after migration. There is a current lack of insight into their health status. Methods A unique notification system was designed to monitor mortality in Dutch <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> <b>centres</b> (2002 - 2005). Results Standardised for age and sex, overall mortality among <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> shows no difference from the Dutch population. However, it differs between subpopulations by sex, age and region of origin and by cause of death. Mortality among <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> is higher than among the Dutch reference population at younger ages and lower at ages above 40. The most common causes of death among <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> are cancer, cardiovascular diseases and external causes. Increased mortality was found from infectious diseases (males, standardised mortality ratio (SMR) = 5. 44 (95 % CI 3. 22 to 8. 59); females, SMR= 7. 53 (95 % CI 4. 22 to 12. 43)), external causes (males, SMR= 1. 95 (95 % CI 0. 52 to 2. 46); females SMR= 1. 60 (95 % CI 0. 87 to 2. 68)) and congenital anomalies in females (SMR 2. 42; 95 % CI 1. 16 to 4. 45).

40|$|Objective: To {{monitor the}} dietary intake of energy, macro- and micronutrients in <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> {{children}}. Design and setting: Cross-sectional study in three <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> <b>centres</b> in The Netherlands. Subjects: Hundred and sixteen children 2 - 12 years old (86 % {{of the study}} cohort) provided a dietary history. Method: The dietary intake was estimated by 24 h recall, and {{the origin of the}} children was classified in three geographic regions: African (n = 45), Central Asia (n = 34) or Eastern Europe (n = 37). Results: The total energy intake from fat was in 24 % of the children above 40 En%. Seventy per cent of the children above 4 year of age had a saturated fat intake above 10 En%. The children from Eastern Europe had a higher intake of fat and disaccharides than the children from the other regions. Among the children, an intake less than 80 % of the recommended daily allowances of micronutrients was found for calcium (42 %), iron (49 %), vitamin A (45 %) and vitamin D (80 %). An inadequate dietary intake of iron and vitamin D was significantly more seen among the youngest children, whereas an inadequate intake of calcium and vitamin A was found more among the elder children. Conclusions: The dietary intake of a prominent proportion of these children contains too much fat and insufficient amounts of calcium, iron, vitamin A and vitamin D. The low micronutrient intake of the <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> children can be considered as a nutritional risk.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore {{perceived}} posttraumatic growth (PTG) and its associations with potentially traumatic events (PTEs), dispositional optimism, perceived social support, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and satisfaction with life (SWL) among adolescent refugees and <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> Method: A cross-sectional design was employed including 111 refugees, aged 12 – 17, that were recruited from <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> <b>centres</b> throughout the Netherlands. Measurements included the revised Posttraumatic Growth Inventory for Children, Children's Impact of Event Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, The Life Orientation Test, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Results: Participants reported mean PTG scores (20. 2) indicating an average response of some perceived change, while reporting high levels of PTSD symptoms (30. 6). PTG and PTSD symptoms were not related with each other (r= 0. 07, p= 0. 50). PTG was positively associated with dispositional optimism (r= 0. 41, p< 0. 01) and social support (r= 0. 43, p< 0. 01). A hierarchical regression analysis demonstrated that dispositional optimism (β= 0. 33; p< 0. 05) and social support (β= 0. 27; p< 0. 05) positively predicted PTG, explaining 22 % of the PTG variance above demographic variables and PTEs. PTG was also positively related with SWL (r= 0. 37, p< 0. 01). Conclusions: Perceived PTG and PTSD symptoms appear to be independent constructs, which co-occur in adolescent refugees and <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> The relationship between PTG and mental health remains inconclusive; PTG was positively related to SWL and not associated with PTSD symptoms. Longitudinal research is required to determine causality between PTG and mental health in this refugee population confronted with many traumatic experiences and challenging migration tasks...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} 15 years, {{numerous}} <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> <b>centres</b> (ASCs) {{have been founded}} in the Netherlands, often preceded and followed by neighbourhood unrest. In this contribution we show to what extent people object to the foundation of ASCs of different sizes.

We use a large-scale survey of a representative sample of the Dutch population. To these individual level data we added contextual information related to the postal code and the municipality respondents live in. We find that objection to large centres is far more widespread than objection to small centres. Lower educated people object more strongly to centres, whatever the size. People with high incomes tend to object to large centres more strongly than people with low incomes. At the contextual level we find that in neighbourhoods with high values for real estate, people object more strongly to small centres. Municipalities with high percentages of low income populations object to small centres more strongly. The percentage of ethnic minorities at the postal code or municipality level is not related to objection to centres, whereas the actual presence of an ASC in the neighbourhood decreases objections. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impact of a {{regulated}} society such as the Netherlands on the lives of refugees in general and on those of Iranian women refugees in particular. Two periods are distinguished in regard to Dutch asylum policies: the 1980 s and post- 1990. For the 1980 s when refugee reception was less restricted, I use empirical material collected between 1995 and 2000. The women I interviewed during this period were leftist activists involved in the Iranian revolution of 1979 and had to leave Iran because of their political backgrounds. The material used for the post- 1990 or more restricted period, is mainly from secondary sources, supplemented by occasional, informal visits to <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> <b>centres.</b> The paper argues that a strict refugee policy - especially the policy that was put in place during the 1990 s - has a direct effect on the affected refugees by making them dependents of the state. These restricted policies reinforce the image of refugees as problems in society and have an effect, albeit less direct, on the lives of the refugees who arrived prior to the 1990 s and who are now Dutch citizens. © The Author [2005].

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{suicide and}} suicidal {{behaviour}} risk factors are highly prevalent in <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> {{but there is}} little insight into the suicide death rate and the suicidal behaviour incidence in this population. The main objective {{of this study is to}} assess the burden of suicide and hospital-treated non-fatal suicidal behaviour in <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in the Netherlands and to identify factors that could guide prevention. Methods We obtained data on cases of suicide and suicidal behaviour from all <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> reception <b>centres</b> in the Netherlands (period 2002 - 2007, age 15 +). The suicide death rates in this population and in subgroups by sex, age and region of origin were compared with the rate in the Dutch population; the rates of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour were compared with that in the population of The Hague using indirect age group standardization. Results The study included 35 suicide deaths and 290 cases of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour. The suicide death rate and the incidence of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour differed between subgroups by sex and region of origin. For male <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> the suicide death rate was higher than that of the Dutch population (N = 32; RR = 2. 0, 95 %CI 1. 37 - 2. 83). No difference was found between suicide mortality in female <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and in the female general population of the Netherlands (N = 3; RR = 0. 73; 95 %CI 0. 15 - 2. 07). The incidence of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour was high in comparison with the population of The Hague for males and females from Europe and the Middle East/South West Asia, and low for males and females from Africa.

The study included 35 suicide deaths and 290 cases of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour. The suicide death rate and the incidence of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour differed between subgroups by sex and region of origin. For male <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> the suicide death rate was higher than that of the Dutch population (N = 32; RR = 2. 0, 95 %CI 1. 37 - 2. 83). No difference was found between suicide mortality in female <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and in the female general population of the Netherlands (N = 3; RR = 0. 73; 95 %CI 0. 15 - 2. 07). The incidence of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour was high in comparison with the population of The Hague for males and females from Europe and the Middle East/South West Asia, and low for males and females from Africa. Health professionals knew about mental health problems prior to the suicidal behaviour for 80 % of the hospital-treated suicidal behaviour cases in <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> In this study the suicide death rate was higher in male <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> than in males in the reference population. The incidence of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour was higher in several subgroups of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> than that in the reference population. We conclude that measures to prevent suicide and suicidal behaviour among <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in the Netherlands are indicate...|$|R

This decade, however, has witnessed a steady erosion of that ethos, the most disturbing change being the tendency to confine <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in detention <b>centres</b> in countries of the West. Many of these people have suffered torture and other abuses, raising particular concerns that the anxiety, fear, and frustration provoked by detention may prolong and exacerbate underlying traumatic stress reactions and thereby create long-term psychosocial disability. Of the five million people seeking asylum in the more-developed world during 1980 – 99, the majority have been allowed to live in the community while awaiting the outcome of their refugee claims. Increasingly, however, industrialised countries are building or extending facilities to detain <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> In 2000, the USA detained about 5000 <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> at any one time. Australia stands alone in mandating the detention of all individuals entering the country without valid visas irrespective of {{whether or not they are}} seeking asylum. About 3500 <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> including 450 children, were held in detention in that country as of June, 2000. More than 300 were detained for longer Detention of asylum seekers: assault on health, human rights, and social developmen...|$|R
