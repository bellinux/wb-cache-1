2500|$|Before {{the end of}} 1882, Junimea {{constituted}} {{itself into}} an independent group and was courted by the other political poles. In that context, Carp became Ambassador to the Austrian Court, appointed by the Brătianu cabinet. He mistrusted the Premier's sincerity, but argued: [...] "he cannot back out, everything is directed against Russia and for sure things <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> put {{for two or three}} years." [...] His diplomatic skill was invoked in settling a major litigious issue, that of free navigation on the Danube. Brătianu hoped that Carp could persuade the German side in the Danube Commission to vote against the Austrians, allowing Romania to fully control its territorial waters. Carp accomplished his task with unexpected ease.|$|E
2500|$|Obama {{responded with}} an {{explanation}} of how his tax plan would affect a small business in this bracket. Obama said, [...] "If you're a small business, which you would qualify, first of all, you would get a 50 percent tax credit so you'd get a cut in taxes for your health care costs. So you would actually get a tax cut on that part. If your revenue is above 250, then from 250 down, your taxes <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> the same. It is true that, say for 250 up— from 250 to 300 or so, so for that additional amount, you'd go from 36 to 39 percent, which is what it was under Bill Clinton." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stymied by his union, late in 1968 Miller {{organized}} other ill miners {{into the}} West Virginia Black Lung Association and won {{introduction of a}} black-lung bill in the West Virginia state legislature. [...] When Miller led other miners, their families and supporters on a march on the state capitol, Boyle sent legislators a telegram advising them (as Miller put it) [...] "not to worry about those so-and-so miners." [...] Boyle's behind-the-scenes lobbying {{had a significant effect}} at first. [...] When Miller met {{with the president of the}} state senate, the legislator [...] "told us raggedy miners to go back to the mines where we belonged. I got hot and told him, Mr. Jackson, we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here until the snow flies and we are going to turn you out to pasture.' [...] " ...|$|E

2500|$|Deidrick {{said that}} Chad is so [...] "love struck" [...] over Melanie that he doesn't even notice Gabi's feelings. On other hand, Melanie wants to {{maintain}} a friendship with Chad {{to keep him from}} hurting Abigail any further. Though the feelings were very [...] "unexpected," [...] Chad agrees to Melanie's wishes. When Deidrick started dating his costar Molly Burnett, the duo discussed the possibility of being paired together onscreen. Deidrick said that their real life romance helped with the portrayal of their [...] "real" [...] romance; [...] "For Melanie and Chad, the backstory was already there." [...] While it doesn't always work for other couples, Deidrick and Burnett immediately [...] "clicked" [...] in their onscreen romance. Burnett said Melanie brings out the funnier side of Chad. As a couple, Chad and Melanie are very [...] "playful" [...] and that is how they express their love for one another. However, most of Chad and Melanie's relationship is plagued by the schemes of Chad's former flame, Gabi Hernandez (Camila Banus) who obsesses over Chad. In an interview with TV Guide, Banus explained that Gabi who is on the rebound after breaking up with Will falls for Chad after he comes to her rescue; [...] "she looks at [...] as her hero." [...] Though they are forced to work so closely together during their modeling career, Chad is [...] "oblivious" [...] to Gabi's feelings. Deidrick explained that Chad only takes on the modeling gig to make Gabi's life easier due to her split with Will. However, when it comes to romance, Chad is focused on his budding romance with Melanie. Deidrick stated: [...] "He cares about Gabi, but as far as he's concerned, things <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> completely platonic. Gabi has no idea about Melanie, so she thinks Chad's fair game." [...] Though he won't admit it, Chad knows they have a chemistry during their photo shoots. The dynamic eventually develops into a triangle which leads to Gabi becoming [...] "very manipulative" [...] and a bit of a [...] "psycho" [...] in her quest for Chad's affections.|$|E
