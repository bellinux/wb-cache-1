5|$|The {{theory of}} low {{temperature}} superconductivity {{has been well}} understood since the BCS theory of 1957. It {{is based on a}} peculiarity of the interaction between two electrons in <b>a</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>lattice.</b> However, the BCS theory does not explain high temperature superconductivity, and its precise mechanism is still a mystery. What is known is that the composition of the copper-oxide materials must be precisely controlled for superconductivity to occur.|$|E
5|$|Although ionic {{compounds}} contain charged atoms or clusters, {{these materials}} do not typically conduct electricity to any significant extent when the substance is solid. In order to conduct, the charged particles must be mobile rather than stationary in <b>a</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>lattice.</b> This is achieved {{to some degree}} at high temperatures when the defect concentration increases the ionic mobility and solid state ionic conductivity is observed. When the ionic compounds are dissolved in a liquid or are melted into a liquid, they can conduct electricity because the ions become completely mobile. This conductivity gain upon dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of ionic compounds.|$|E

30|$|Such {{effect of}} thermal {{magnetic}} treatment on magnetic susceptibility {{can be explained}} by the fact that magnetic characteristics of the investigated alloy are defined by an interaction of nanoparticles of precipitated phase. Nanoparticles that are within the martensite crystals are subjected to considerable coherent stresses caused by <b>a</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>lattices</b> mismatch of martensite and nanoparticles, which leads to magnetic anisotropy of nanoparticles ensemble. The <b>crystal</b> <b>lattice</b> mismatch sharply increases when cubic lattice of the austenitic matrix is transformed into the orthorhombic lattice of martensite, and, thus, the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility is caused by a corresponding change in magnetic anisotropy of nanoparticles.|$|R

25|$|A crystal or {{crystalline}} solid is a {{solid material}} whose constituents (such as atoms, molecules, or ions) are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming <b>a</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>lattice</b> that extends in all directions. In addition, macroscopic single crystals are usually identifiable by their geometrical shape, consisting of flat faces with specific, characteristic orientations. The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as crystallography. The process of crystal formation via mechanisms of crystal growth is called crystallization or solidification.|$|E

Therefore, counting these lines can reveal a fairly accurate measurement.|$|R
25|$|At {{absolute}} zero temperature, <b>a</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>lattice</b> {{lies in its}} ground state, and contains no phonons. A lattice at a nonzero temperature has an energy that is not constant, but fluctuates randomly about some mean value. These energy fluctuations are caused by random lattice vibrations, which {{can be viewed as}} a gas of phonons. (The random motion of the atoms in the lattice is what we usually think of as heat.) Because these phonons are generated by the temperature of the lattice, they are sometimes designated thermal phonons.|$|E
25|$|Solids with purely {{metallic}} bonding are characteristically ductile and, {{in their}} pure forms, have low strength; melting points {{can be very}} low (e.g., Mercury melts at 234K (−39°C). These properties are consequences of the non-directional and non-polar nature of metallic bonding, which allows atoms (and planes of atoms in <b>a</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>lattice)</b> to move past one another without disrupting their bonding interactions. Metals can be strengthened by introducing crystal defects (for example, by alloying) that interfere with the motion of dislocations that mediate plastic deformation. Further, some transition metals exhibit directional bonding in addition to metallic bonding; this increases shear strength and reduces ductility, imparting some {{of the characteristics of}} a covalent solid (an intermediate case below).|$|E
25|$|The energy {{spectrum}} of an electron {{moving in a}} periodical potential of rigid crystal lattice consists of allowed and forbidden bands and {{is known as the}} Bloch spectrum. An electron with energy inside an allowed band moves as a free electron but has an effective mass that differs from the electron mass in vacuum. However, <b>a</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>lattice</b> is deformable and displacements of atoms (ions) from their equilibrium positions are described in terms of phonons. Electrons interact with these displacements, and this interaction is known as electron-phonon coupling. One of possible scenarios was proposed in the seminal 1933 paper by Lev Landau, which includes the production of a lattice defect such as an F-center and a trapping of the electron by this defect. A different scenario was proposed by Solomon Pekar that envisions dressing the electron with lattice deformation (a cloud of virtual phonons). Such an electron with the accompanying deformation moves freely across the crystal, but with increased effective mass. Pekar coined for this charge carrier the term polaron.|$|E

"When I {{presented}} my {{results at}} a meeting of the American Physical Society in 1923," [...] Compton later recalled, [...] "it initiated the most hotly contested scientific controversy that I have ever known."

It was particularly telling that diffraction in <b>a</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>lattice</b> could only be explained with reference to its wave nature. It earned Compton the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927. Compton and Alfred W. Simon developed the method for observing at the same instant individual scattered X-ray photons and the recoil electrons. In Germany, Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger independently developed a similar method.|$|E
