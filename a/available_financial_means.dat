40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{processes}} of partisan dealignment and professionalisation have taken place. But how do political parties adapt their financial behaviour to {{these changes in}} the political-electoral system? We answer this question by analysing two indicators. First, we examine to what extent parties spend their <b>available</b> <b>financial</b> <b>means</b> (saving versus spending strategy). Second, we study how parties spend their <b>available</b> <b>financial</b> <b>means</b> (bureaucratic versus electoral strategy). Based on these two indicators {{we set up a}} two-dimensional model describing the financial behaviour of political parties, which we apply to data of Belgian parties in the period 1999 - 2015. The results illustrate that most parties generally adopt a bureaucratic saving strategy, but that {{there has not been a}} linear evolution between 1999 and 2015 towards a specific financial behaviour as a reaction to dealignment and professionalisation. status: accepte...|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to the initiatives of the Kennisinstituut Mondzorg (Institute for Knowledge Translation in Oral Care), the importance of effective education {{in the area of}} guidelines is increasing. Future dentists will, after all, be confronted with new guidelines and {{need to be able to}} integrate them in their daily practice. Various guidelines and protocols have been established within the 3 dental schools. For students and instructors, however, the motivation for these guidelines and protocols is not always sufficiently clear. In addition, the terms guideline, clinical practice guideline and protocol are used interchangeably, resulting in terminological confusion. Embedding within and coordination with theoretical education is also still limited in all programmes and it is proposed that the 3 dental schools collaborate on this issue. Finally, it is advised to replace the term 'evidence-based' with 'evidence-informed' because this indicates more clearly that other factors (patients opinion, <b>available</b> <b>financial</b> <b>means,</b> etc.) play a role in the final choice of treatment in a specific situation.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the thesis is to explore the {{specifics}} of the financial management of holdings companies in the Czech Republic with an emphasis on the area of financial management. However, the author assumes that persistent reasons for holding creation is using of synergy effects consisting mainly of centralized management of cash flows to minimize the cost of capital and minimizing the risk of an individual investor who actively makes managerial functions in view guarantees of individual companies. It was found the lack of a comprehensive and systematic approach for a qualitative research. A total of 15 holding companies was use for the qualitative research. The outcome gives many answers concerning {{the specifics of the}} financial management of the holdings companies. It seems guarantee and minimizing cost of capital are key points. The synergistic effect of the holding companies can be used when transferring financial means between companies holding.

40|$|The {{period between}} 1946 and 1980 {{was marked by}} the {{construction}} of large urban neighbourhoods of multi-dwelling buildings. These buildings represent {{a large part of}} the existing building stock. The conditions surveys show that they are often in inadequate state and that they do not meet the requirements of contemporary standards. In order to ensure adequate maintenance of such buildings, new legislature that introduces compulsory function of building manager was adopted recently. The manager is, among other duties, responsible for all maintenance works. Further, the new legislature of 2003 introduces a new way of collecting maintenance funds by establishing a special backup fund that can be used for maintenance activities only. As a consequence, it is expected that the trend of increased maintenance work and systematic approach to maintenance of multi-dwelling buildings will be enhanced. The thesis presents activities required for maintenance execution of multi-dwelling buildings together with all relevant legislature that need to be respected from both owner/tenant's and manager's side. The duties of various participants in the maintenance process, maintenance planning and financial plan preparation are discussed. Further, the responsibilities and relations between tenants/owners and manager are outlined. It is concluded that the level of maintenance for multi-dwelling buildings and rational management of <b>available</b> <b>financial</b> <b>means</b> does not depend only upon the manager, but also upon owners/tenants and their supervision of the manager...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{integration}} with the European Union {{is connected with}} the necessity of making considerable investment outlays {{in the field of}} environmental protection. These are costs of the order of 20 Åš 39 billion euro depending on the decisions concerning the interpretation of the requirements for Poland. An essential source of financing investments for environmental protection will be bank credit. In this context it is important to what degree the Polish banks could adapt their current activity to the specific conditions of implementation the policy of environmental protection. Possible variants of the participation of banks for environmental protection concern both active and passive operations. In the scope of active operations the bank can engage in environmental protection by recognizing ecological risk as part of the credit risk in bank activity and also by providing credits. Whereas in the scope of passive operations the banks have the possibility of using a suitably chosen set of instruments serving to obtain capital for financing ecological undertakings. Depending on the differences in the scope of action, organization and the principles of functioning of the bank one can distinguish two types of ecological banks - the ecological bank and the bank in which equally important as the ecological criterion are the commercial principles of conducting bank activity. The banks are trying to face the difficult ecological problems also in a complex way and on the level of international settlements. Such a breakthrough moment in the functioning of the banks for which the subject of environmental protection is not alien was the signing of the declaration UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) Financial Institutions on the Environment and Sustainable Development. It {{must be taken into account}} that with the progress in the implementation of adaptation programmes in the field of environmental protection the commitment of the bank sector will grow for gaining and making <b>available</b> <b>financial</b> <b>means</b> for investors. ...|$|E
40|$|International {{attention}} towards {{energy efficiency}} improvement is growing, pressuring {{the built environment}} to become more sustainable. Part of this energy efficiency improvement must be achieved at Dutch primary school buildings, but insufficient- and separation of budgets complicate the development of sustainable school buildings. Subject to this financial pressure, the current poor state of primary school buildings in terms of indoor environmental quality is, and will remain insufficient. Affecting performance, productivity and health of students and staff, and additionally having a monetary impact on school boards. The inability to achieve energy efficiency in combination with good indoor environmental quality, within the <b>available</b> <b>financial</b> <b>means,</b> is for a large part explained {{by a lack of}} knowledge and experience in building renovation by many Dutch school boards. Often, indoor environmental quality {{is one of the first}} things to suffer from insufficient funds. A decision-making framework is developed to provide school boards with the necessary knowledge and insight to better finance and organize renovation projects, providing more (financial) room to address the indoor environmental quality of their school buildings. Leading to more balanced school buildings in terms of People (indoor environmental quality), Planet (energy efficiency), and Profit (costs). This framework comprises of a decision flowchart, supplemented by sustainable measure packages, that facilitates school boards in the renovation decision making process. The flowchart provides school boards insight in the decision-making process, (technical, financial and organizational) renovation opportunities, and effects of-, and on-, indoor environmental quality. This flowchart is developed using desk research, qualitative interviews and expert meetings. Then tested by obtaining qualitative expectations in interviews with school boards and a focus group with financial experts. The expectations are that the decision-framework does provide more insight in the renovation decision-making process and opportunities, and that this could lead to better financing and organization of school building renovation projects. By raising problem awareness about indoor environmental quality effects, the framework is also expected to contribute to improved indoor environmental quality in renovated school buildings. For further research, guiding school boards in contracting market parties is advised. This addition should present how to challenge contractors to come up with smart solutions to fulfil the ambitions of school boards. Furthermore, the flowchart should be tested by â€™eenpittersâ€™ (school boards managing a single school), as they are often mentioned as key beneficiary. Also, the development of a digital version of the flowchart could enable easy use and sharing of the tool as well as easy coupling with other existing instruments. Finally, for further development the following â€™rulesâ€™ should be kept in mind: the strength of the flowchart is in its simplicity, donâ€™t develop something new, bring together existing instruments, and use the language of the educational sector...|$|E
