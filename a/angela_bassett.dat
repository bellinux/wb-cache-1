500|$|The Quick and the Deads dismal {{box office}} {{performance}} {{can be attributed}} to competition from Billy Madison, The Brady Bunch Movie, Just Cause and Heavyweights. Director Sam Raimi later blamed himself and his visual style for the film's failure. [...] "I was very confused after I made that movie. For a number of years I thought, I'm like a dinosaur. I couldn't change with the material." [...] TriStar Pictures also showed The Quick and the Dead as an [...] "out-of-competition" [...] film at the May 1995 Cannes Film Festival.

500|$|In early October 2007, open casting {{calls for}} the role of Wallace began. Actors, rappers and unknowns all tried out. Beanie Sigel auditioned for the role, but was not picked.

500|$|Although {{the script}} for Strange Days was {{completed}} in 1993, the lead characters were not secured in the cast list until May 1994. Originally, actor Andy Garcia was a potential candidate to star in the film, and Bono of the Irish rock band U2 was rumored to star as Faith's love interest Philo Gant. Ultimately, Academy Award nominees Ralph Fiennes, <b>Angela</b> <b>Bassett,</b> and Juliette Lewis were chosen as the leads. Fiennes' role in the Schindler's List impressed Bigelow enough to want to cast him as Nero, stating that the role [...] "required somebody who had {{a tremendous amount of}} intelligence, complexity, depth, a series of qualities that I really felt only Ralph could supply." [...] Cameron, however, felt that a [...] "glibber and slicker" [...] actor would be better for the role, but admitted that Fiennes made Lenny [...] "a sexier character—a guy you can care about very much." [...] In contrast, Bassett was already suggested by Cameron since the beginning. The fact that Lewis was able to sing was appreciated as the producers wanted to avoid lip-synching.|$|E

Eric Mabius expressed interest for the role of Cyclops. <b>Angela</b> <b>Bassett</b> was approached to portray Storm in late 1997, as was Janet Jackson. Anna Paquin dropped out of the lead role in Tart in favor of X-Men. Terence Stamp was considered for Magneto before Singer cast Ian McKellen, who had acted in his previous film, Apt Pupil. McKellen responded to the gay allegory of the film, [...] "the allegory of the mutants as outsiders, disenfranchised and alone and coming to all of that at puberty when their difference manifests," [...] Singer explained. [...] "Ian is an activist and he really responded to the potential of that allegory." ...|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{analyzed}} the film within {{a discussion of}} the genre of blaxploitation: [...] "As the audience for blaxploitation dwindled, it seemed as if Car Wash and The Wiz might be the last gasp of what had been a steadily expanding black presence in mainstream filmmaking." [...] The St. Petersburg Times noted, [...] "Of course, it only took one flop like The Wiz (1978) to give Hollywood an excuse to retreat to safer (i.e., whiter) creative ground until John Singleton and Spike Lee came along. Yet, without blaxploitation there might not have been another generation of black filmmakers, no Denzel Washington or <b>Angela</b> <b>Bassett,</b> or they might have taken longer to emerge." [...] The Boston Globe commented, [...] "the term 'black film' should be struck from the critical vocabulary. To appreciate just how outmoded, deceptive and limiting it is, consider the following, all of which have been described as black films, [...] [...] [...]" [...] and characterized The Wiz in a list which also featured 1970s films Shaft, Blacula, and Super Fly.|$|E

Turner contributed to the soundtrack for What's Love Got to Do with It, re-recording songs from her Revue days and recording several newer songs, including {{what turned out to}} be her last Top 10 U.S. hit, [...] "I Don't Wanna Fight." [...] Other than helping Bassett with her wardrobe and teaching her dance steps as well as providing songs for the soundtrack, and appearing as herself at the end of the film, she refused to be involved fully in the film, telling an interviewer, [...] "Why would I want to see Ike Turner beat me up again? I haven't dwelled on it; it's all in the past where it belongs." [...] Following the film's and soundtrack's release, Turner embarked on her first US tour in seven years.
