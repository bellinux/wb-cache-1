40|$|The {{location}} and motion of Saturn’s equatorial current sheet {{is the result}} of an interplay between a quasi-static deformation that varies in radial distance and local time, impulsive perturbations that produce large-scale displacements, quasi-periodic perturbations near the planetary rotation period, and wave-like structures on shorter timescales. This study focuses on the latter, <b>aperiodic</b> <b>wave</b> pulses with periods from 1 - 30 minutes, that are unrelated to the quasi-periodic ‘flapping’ with a period near that of Saturn’s rotation. Cassini magnetometer data were surveyed for these aperiodic structures and then fitted to a simple model in order to estimate the properties of the waves. The model consists of a modified Harris current sheet model deformed by a Gaussian pulse wave function. This then allows for the extraction of wave parameters and current sheet properties. In particular we show an increase in current sheet scale height with radial distance from Saturn, an increase in the wave amplitude with radial distance, and the resolution of propagation directions using the wave vector fitted by the model. The dominant propagation direction is found to be radially outwards from Saturn...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{spectral}} analysis {{is essential for}} deriving spatial patterns from simultaneous recordings of electrocorticograms (ECoG), {{in order to determine}} the optimal interval between electrodes in arrays, and to design spatial filters, particularly for extraction of information about the dynamics of human gamma activity. ECoG were recorded from up to 64 electrodes 0. 5 mm apart in a linear array 3. 2 cm long, which was placed on the exposed superior temporal gyrus or motor cortex of volunteers undergoing diagnostic surgery. Visual displays of multiple traces revealed broad spectrum oscillations in episodic bursts having a common <b>aperiodic</b> <b>wave</b> form with recurring patterns of spatial amplitude modulation (AM patterns) on selected portions of the array. The onedimensional spatial spectrum of the human ECoG was calculated at successive time samples and averaged over periods up to 20 s. Log power decreased monotonically with increasing log spatial frequency in cycles/mm (c/mm) to the noise level ~ 2 log units below maximal power at minimal frequency (0. 039 0. 002 c/mm). The inflection point at 0. 40 0. 05 c/mm specified an optimal value for a low pass spatial filter to remove noise, and an optimal interelectrode spacing of 1. 25 mm to avoid undersampling and aliasing. An 8 x 8 array with that spacing would be 10 x 10 mm...|$|E

Presence of higher harmonics in addition to the fundamental causes variation in the timbre, which is the reason why the same musical note (the same frequency) played on different instruments sounds different.

50|$|Sound waves {{themselves}} {{do not have}} pitch, but their oscillations can be measured to obtain a frequency. It takes a sentient mind to map the internal quality of pitch. However, pitches are usually associated with, and thus quantified as frequencies in cycles per second, or hertz, by comparing sounds with pure tones, which have periodic, sinusoidal waveforms. Complex and <b>aperiodic</b> sound <b>waves</b> can often be assigned a pitch by this method.|$|R
40|$|The phase-turbulent (PT) regime {{for the one}} {{dimensional}} complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) is carefully studied, {{in the limit of}} large systems and long integration times, using an efficient new integration scheme. Particular attention is paid to solutions with a non-zero phase gradient. For fixed control parameters, solutions with conserved average phase gradient ν exist only for |ν| less than some upper limit. The transition from phase to defect-turbulence happens when this limit becomes zero. A Lyapunov analysis shows that the system becomes less and less chaotic for increasing values of the phase gradient. For high values of the phase gradient a family of non-chaotic solutions of the CGLE is found. These solutions consist of spatially periodic or <b>aperiodic</b> <b>waves</b> travelling with constant velocity. They typically have incommensurate velocities for phase and amplitude propagation, showing thereby a novel type of quasiperiodic behavior. The main features of these travelling wave solutions can be explained through a modified Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation that rules the phase dynamics of the CGLE in the PT phase. The latter explains also the behavior of the maximal Lyapunov exponents of chaotic solutions. Comment: 16 pages, LaTeX (Version 2. 09), 10 Postscript-figures included, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

40|$|Spatiotemporal wave {{activities}} in excitable heart tissues {{have long been}} the subject of numerous studies because they underlie different forms of cardiac arrhythmias. In particular, understanding the dynamics and the instabilities of spiral waves have become very important because they can cause reentrant tachycardia and their subsequent transitions to fibrillation. Although many aspects of cardiac spiral waves have been investigated through experiments and model simulations, their complex properties are far from well understood. Here, we show that intriguing complex-periodic (such as period- 2, period- 3, period- 4, or <b>aperiodic)</b> spiral <b>wave</b> states can arise in monolayer tissues of cardiac cell culture in vitro, and demonstrate that these different dynamic states can coexist with abrupt and spontaneous transitions among them without any change in system parameters; in other words, the medium supports multistability.

40|$|New {{methods were}} devised {{to improve the}} {{discrimination}} of EEG spatial amplitude patterns recorded from arrays of 64 electrodes placed on visual, auditory or somatic cortex. The 64 traces shared a spatially coherent, <b>aperiodic</b> carrier <b>wave</b> with a spatial pattern of amplitude modulation (AM). Previous observations on AM patterns from rabbits trained to discriminate conditioned stimuli with reinforcement (CS+) and without (CS-) had revealed epochs between the CS and the CR in which AM patterns on CS+ trials could be distinguished from AM patterns on CS- trials. The AM patterns were expressed by points in 64 -space that formed clusters. Levels of CS-/CS+ pattern separation were quantified by a pair-wise Euclidean distance method with cross-validation. The present study documents use of the technique for nonlinear mapping (NLM) to project the 64 -dimensional structure onto a plane while preserving the relative distances between all points. The goodness of classification by the Euclidean distance measure was the same or improved after projection. Whereas the Euclidean distance measure only gave pair-wise classifications, the planar displays showed the patterns for multiple clusters simultaneously. These NLM-based methods revealed previously unrecognized structures within distributions of AM patterns in sensory cortices in the time period between the CS and CR. 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.

The unprecedented bimetallic 2 D coordination polymer {Fe[(Hg(SCN) 3) 2](4, 4 ’-bipy) 2 }n exhibits a thermal high-spin (HS) $low-spin (LS) staircase-like conversion characterized by a multi-step dependence of the HS molar fraction gHS. Between the fully HS (gHS= 1) and LS (gHS= 0) phases, two steps associated with different ordering appear in terms of spin-state concentration waves (SSCW). On the gHS= 0. 5 step, a periodic SSCW forms with a HS-LS-HS-LS sequence. On the gHS= 0. 34 step, the 4 D superspace crystallography structural refinement reveals an aperiodic SSCW, with a HS-LS sequence incommensurate with the molecular lattice. The formation of these different long-range spatially ordered structures of LS and HS states during the multi-step spin-crossover is discussed within the framework of “Devil's staircase”-type transitions. Spatially modulated phases are known in various types of materials but are uniquely related to molecular HS/LS bistability in this case...|$|R

40|$|Periodic surface {{structures}} are nowadays standard {{building blocks of}} optical devices. If such {{structures are}} illuminated by <b>aperiodic</b> time-harmonic incident <b>waves</b> as, e. g., Gaussian beams, the resulting surface scattering problem must be formulated in an unbounded layer including the periodic surface structure. An obvious recipe to avoid the need to discretize this problem in an unbounded domain {{is to set up}} an equivalent system of quasiperiodic scattering problems in a single (bounded) periodicity cell via the Floquet-Bloch transform. The solution to the original surface scattering problem then equals the inverse Floquet-Bloch transform applied to the family of solutions to the quasiperiodic problems, which simply requires to integrate these solutions in the quasiperiodicity parameter. A numerical scheme derived from this representation hence completely avoids the need to tackle differential equations on unbounded domains. In this paper, we provide rigorous convergence analysis and error bounds for such a scheme when applied to a two-dimensional model problem, relying upon a quadrature-based approximation to the inverse Floquet-Bloch transform and finite element approximations to quasiperiodic scattering problems. Our analysis essentially relies upon regularity results for the family of solutions to the quasiperiodic scattering problems in suitable mixed Sobolev spaces. We illustrate our error bounds as well as efficiency of the numerical scheme via several numerical examples...|$|R
40|$|Silicon-on-insulator (SOI), as {{the most}} {{promising}} platform, for advanced photonic integrated structures, employs a high refractive index contrast between the silicon 2 ̆ 01 ccore 2 ̆ 01 d and surrounding media. One of the recent new ideas within this field {{is based on the}} alternative formation of the subwavelength sized (quasi) periodic structures, manifesting as an effective medium with respect to propagating light. Such structures relay on Bloch wave propagation concept, in contrast to standard index guiding mechanism. Soon after the invention of such subwavelength grating (SWG) waveguides, the scientists concentrated on various functional elements such as couplers, crossings, mode transformers, convertors, MMI couplers, polarization converters, resonators, Bragg filters, and others. Our contribution is devoted to a detailed numerical analysis and design considerations of Bragg filtering structures based on SWG idea. Based on our previous studies where we have shown impossibility of application of various 2 and 2 ̆ 01 c 2. 52 ̆ 01 d dimensional methods for the proper numerical analysis, here we effectively use two independent but similar in-house approaches based on 3 D Fourier modal methods, namely <b>aperiodic</b> rigorous coupled <b>wave</b> analysis (aRCWA) and bidirectional expansion and propagation method based on Fourier series (BEX) tools. As it was recently demonstrated, SWG Bragg filters are feasible. Based on this idea, we propose, simulate, and optimize spectral characteristics of such filters. In particular, we have investigated several possibilities of modifications of original SWG waveguides towards the Bragg filtering, including firstly - simple single-segment changes in position, thickness, and width, and secondly - several types of Si inclusions, in terms of perturbed width and thickness (and their combinations). The leading idea was to obtain required (e. g. sufficiently narrow) spectral characteristic while keeping the minimum size of Si features large enough. We have found that the second approach with the single element perturbations can provide promising designs. Furthermore, even more complex filtering SWG structures can be considered.

40|$|Recently, as a {{flexible}} and perspective alternative to standard silicon-on-insulator (SOI) nanophotonic platform, subwavelength grating structured (SWG) waveguides and more advanced nanophotonic structures {{based on this}} novel concept have attracted increasing attention within the community. Such structures relay on Bloch wave propagating concept, in contrast to standard index guiding mechanism. In this way, they can indeed provide a promising alternative to standard nanophotonic platform, due {{to a variety of}} signal processing functions provided with tunability of SWG structure parameters. This additional variability in the (effective) refractive index functionalities, applied in designs of novel integrated-optical nanophotonic components and devices, provides welcomed flexibility of present and potential for new concepts and components, without significantly increasing fabrication complexity. A SWG structure is based on a (quasi) -periodic arrangement between two different materials, i. e. rectangular blocks of silicon of different dimensions embedded into a lower-index superstrate, with a period much smaller than the wavelength of the light. Clearly, by changing the filling factor, i. e., the duty-cycle of the SWG structure, its effective refractive index can be varied essentially between that of the superstrate and that of substrate (silicon). Applying this idea, several types of SWG based structures and devices have been proposed in last couple of years, such as straight guides, crossings, mode transformers and convertors, polarization converters, ring resonators, MMI couplers, and specially designed tapered couplers for efficient light in/out coupling into SWG structures. However, it was not until recently when several of us have realized and theoretically demonstrated, with the help of properly tuned quasiperiodic modulation in grating structuring, that the SWG concept can also be used for designing SWG filtering devices such as Bragg optical filters. This contribution is thus devoted to a detailed numerical analysis of various novel designs of nanophotonic structures based on SWG with additional quasiperiodic modulation. For the numerical analysis, we effectively used and combined two approaches, either 3 D Fourier modal methods, based on our two recently developed in-house and independent algorithms, <b>aperiodic</b> rigorous coupled <b>wave</b> analysis (aRCWA) and bidirectional expansion and propagation method based on Fourier series (BEX) with the Lumerical’s 2. 5 D FDTD commercially available propagation method. This comparison have not only enabled to ensure the reliability of the results, but also determined the advantages as well as limitations of the individual approaches. Based on that, we propose, simulate, and possibly optimize, the behavior of several filters and other structures based on SWG and quasiperiodicity modulation concept, with the discussion of their potential applicability...|$|R
