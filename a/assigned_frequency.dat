30|$|The CR FA {{task is to}} <b>assign</b> the <b>frequencies</b> to the SUs {{when and}} where they request access to the spectrum, to <b>assign</b> new <b>frequencies</b> to the CR users when co- or {{adjacent}} channel PU transmission occurs in the interference range, or when the quality of service reduces below the requested threshold. As a result of that, we are facing {{with the task of}} <b>assigning</b> <b>frequencies</b> in a partially colored graph. In that respect, the FA is a continuous process, as {{it is not possible to}} <b>assign</b> <b>frequencies</b> and optimize coloring to the entire CR network at the same moment. There is a need to constantly <b>assign</b> and re-assign <b>frequencies</b> to active SUs. If the PU reactivates, new SU appears, or signal level drops due to dynamic characteristics of the radio channel, the FA process has to be re-initiated and channel allocation has to re-converge for the SUs influenced by these changes.|$|R

40|$|The {{frequency}} assignment problem (FAP) {{is the problem}} of <b>assigning</b> <b>frequencies</b> to transmission links such that no interference between signals occurs.

We present an integer linear programming formulation that is closely related to the vertex packing problem. Although the size of this formulation is an order of magnitude larger than the underlying network of links, we use the integer linear programming formulation within a branch-and-cut algorithm. This algorithm employs problem specific and generic techniques such as reduction methods, primal heuristics, and branching rules to obtain optimal solutions.
