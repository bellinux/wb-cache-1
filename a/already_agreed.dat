Both Horsfield and Warnock wanted to terminate the loan prematurely, but West Bromwich Albion had <b>already</b> <b>agreed</b> to sell the player to United {{at the end of}} the season and refused to go back on the deal. The permanent transfer went through in May 2006 for a fee of £1.2million, with Horsfield commenting that he and Warnock had resolved their differences.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, during Atlético's pre-season, Costa {{suffered}} a serious knee injury, {{going on to}} miss {{the majority of the}} season. The injury prevented him from passing a medical at Turkish club Beşiktaş, having <b>already</b> <b>agreed</b> to transfer to them. On 23 January 2012, Costa was loaned to fellow league club Rayo Vallecano until June; he scored four goals in his first three appearances, including two in a 5–3 away win against Levante, eventually finishing his loan spell with 10 goals from 16 games.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to invite Bach {{was made by}} the council on 15 January 1723. The council seemed to have preferred Bach and Graupner because they were invited to show two cantatas each, while other candidates were requested to show only one. Two candidates even had to present their work in the same service. Graupner's performance took place on the last Sunday after Epiphany, 17 January 1723. Two days before the event, the town council <b>already</b> <b>agreed</b> to offer him the position.|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, the Hellenic Parliament did {{not approve}} the new President with the supermajority required, and so a snap {{election}} was called {{for the end of}} January 2015. A few days before the 2015 election took place, Tsakalotos was quizzed on Syriza's economic policies by a number of economists, debt campaigners and investment analysts at the London School of Economics. Tsakalotos said there was a need for fiscal space, meaning 6–7billion Euros a year to spend on an expansionary fiscal policy. He also said that they would cancel the austerity budgets <b>already</b> <b>agreed</b> with the European Union (EU) and International Monetary Fund (IMF), pay back the loans from the IMF and focus on rescheduling and writing off the loans from the EU.|$|E

5|$|Gascoigne {{was named}} on the PFA Team of the Year in the 1990–91 season as Tottenham reached the FA Cup Final, with {{victories}} over Blackpool, Oxford United, Portsmouth, Notts County and North London derby rivals Arsenal. He scored the opening {{goal of the}} 3–1 victory over Arsenal at Wembley with a free-kick, one of six goals he scored in the competition. Going into the final against Nottingham Forest he had <b>already</b> <b>agreed</b> terms to join Italian club Lazio in an £8.5million deal. However just 15 minutes into the game he committed a dangerous knee-high foul on Gary Charles and ruptured his own cruciate ligaments in his right knee. England teammate Stuart Pearce scored from the resultant free kick, and Gascoigne subsequently collapsed after the kick-off, forcing {{him to leave the}} match on a stretcher. Tottenham {{went on to win the}} Cup in extra-time.|$|E
5|$|In 1147 Manuel {{was faced}} with war by Roger II of Sicily, whose fleet had {{captured}} the Byzantine island of Corfu and plundered Thebes and Corinth. However, despite being distracted by a Cuman attack in the Balkans, in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of Conrad III of Germany, and {{the help of the}} Venetians, who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet. In 1149, Manuel recovered Corfu and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans, while Roger II sent George of Antioch with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople's suburbs. Manuel had <b>already</b> <b>agreed</b> with Conrad on a joint invasion and partition of southern Italy and Sicily. The renewal of the German alliance remained the principal orientation of Manuel's foreign policy {{for the rest of his}} reign, despite the gradual divergence of interests between the two empires after Conrad's death.|$|E

40|$|I analyze a {{model of}} {{interest}} group influence on legislative voting through information trans-mission. The model shows how interest groups may craft different messages to target different winning coalitions in order to influence the outcome. If access to legislators is costly then interest groups prefer to coordinate with allied legislators by providing them with information that helps them to persuade less sympathetic legislators. The model reconciles informational theories of lobbying with empirical evidence suggesting that interest groups predominantly lobby those who <b>already</b> <b>agree</b> with them. The model also makes new predictions about the welfare effects of interest group influence: from an ex ante perspective, informational lobbying negatively effects the welfare of legislators. The results highlight {{the need for more}} theories of persuasion that take collective choice institutions into account...|$|R

50|$|The {{stations}} of Limburg Süd and Montabaur, which are approximately 20 km apart, have been criticised {{in the past}} as being the result of political blackmail.

40|$|Practitioners, {{audiences and}} critics are often dismissive of {{political}} comedy’s impact. It {{is argued that}} audiences only attend political performances if they <b>already</b> <b>agree</b> with the performer; further, that audiences will not laugh at ideas that they find too subversive. As laughter depends upon consensus and success depends upon laughter, the comedian “merely” preaches to the converted. This article challenges these assumptions by examining the diverse strategies of two political comedians: Mark Thomas and Stewart Lee. Through analysis of performance, and their methodology and intent as related in practitioner interviews, I demonstrate {{that the nature of}} consensus in political comedy is more complex than has generally been supposed. Far from being a sign of comedy’s impuissance, consensus is used as a tool to enhance and develop political engagement. I suggest that in order to discover whether political comedy matters, we must first broaden our understanding of how it matters...|$|R
