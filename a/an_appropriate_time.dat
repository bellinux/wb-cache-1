Three years later, the Penn Board of Trustees endowed a professorship and several fellowships in Gregorian’s name and awarded him an honorary degree in recognition of his roles as the university’s founding Dean of Arts and Sciences and Provost.|$|E
25|$|In {{the vaccine}} court, as in civil tort cases, {{the burden of}} proof is a {{preponderance}} of evidence, but while in tort cases, this is met by expert testimony establishing a rigorous scientific case, in the vaccine court, the burden is met with a three prong test: the petitioner must present a biological theory of harm, a logical sequence of events connecting the vaccine to the injury, and establish <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>time</b> frame in which injury occurred; the petitioner must also show that there is not another biologically plausible explanation for the injury.|$|E

25|$|The Bay checkerspot went locally extinct {{during the}} early 2000s, last {{observed}} at Edgewood Park in 2002. This local extinction {{has been attributed to}} nitrogen deposition from cars traveling on adjacent Interstate 280, which fertilized invasive Italian ryegrass and choked out native plants required by the butterflies. However, the Italian ryegrass was intentionally planted as an erosion control measure mandated by San Mateo County Planning Department after construction of PG high power lines that cross the park, and spread into the park from that location. Subsequently, attempts to restore the habitat by mowing at <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>time</b> of year to reduce the Italian ryegrass and allow the native plants to regrow. In early 2007, 1000 Bay checkerspot larvae were reintroduced to the park.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{reference}} chart used {{for consumers to}} spot suspicious moles {{is found in the}} mnemonic A-B-C-D, used by institutions such as the American Academy of Dermatology and the National Cancer Institute. The letters stand for asymmetry, border, color, and diameter. Sometimes, the letter E (for elevation or evolving) is added. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, if a mole starts changing in size, color, shape or, especially, if the border of a mole develops ragged edges or becomes larger than a pencil eraser, it would be <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>time</b> to consult with a physician. Other warning signs include a mole, even if smaller than a pencil eraser, that is different from the others and begins to crust over, bleed, itch, or become inflamed. The changes may indicate developing melanomas. The matter can become clinically complicated because mole removal depends on which types of cancer, if any, come into suspicion.|$|E

A group of Pound's friends—Eliot, Cummings, W. H. Auden, Allen Tate, and Julien Cornell—met Laughlin to discuss how to get him released. They planned to have Pound awarded the first Bollingen Prize, a new national poetry award by the Library of Congress, with $1,000 prize money donated by the Mellon family.|$|E

As The X-Files entered its sixth season, Duchovny {{decided that it was}} <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>time</b> to try writing a full episode. Before then, he had felt {{that he did not have}} the skills necessary; he said, [...] "I didn't have the surety, the confidence in my mind, that I could write a teleplay...It took me to the sixth year of the show to actually sit down and write one of my ideas." [...] In late 1998, Duchovny met with series creator Carter and they agreed that Duchovny would write a late-season installment for the series.|$|E
500|$|The {{constant}} {{snow and}} thick mists {{made it difficult}} for Bartlett to calculate the Karluk's position accurately, although during a brief break in the weather on 30 September they glimpsed land which they took to be Cooper Island, in the vicinity of Point Barrow where they had been at the start of August. On 3 October the anxiety of crew and staff increased when, with Point Barrow just [...] distant, the drift turned northwards, away from the land. There were fears among some that Karluk would repeat the experience of the Jeannette, an American vessel that 30years previously had drifted in the Arctic ice for months before sinking, with the subsequent loss of most of her crew. Bartlett became aware that Murray and McKay, the two veterans of Shackleton's Nimrod expedition, were openly contemptuous of their captain's leadership. They were making plans to leave the ship at <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>time,</b> and head for land on their own.|$|E
500|$|In early 1998, the Red Hot Chili Peppers fired guitarist Dave Navarro {{and were}} on the verge of {{breaking}} up.

[...] With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>time</b> to invite him back. When Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] With Frusciante back on guitar, the Chili Peppers began recording their next album, Californication, released in 1999. Frusciante's return restored a key component of the Chili Peppers' sound, as well as a healthy morale. He brought with him his deep devotion to music, which affected the band's recording style during the album. Frusciante has frequently stated that his work on Californication was his favorite.|$|E

30|$|A {{problem of}} peak power in DC-electrified railway systems is {{mainly caused by}} train power demand during acceleration. If this power is reduced, {{substation}} peak power will be significantly decreased. This paper presents a study on optimal energy saving in DC-electrified railway with on-board energy storage system (OBESS) by using peak demand cutting strategy under different trip time controls. The proposed strategy uses OBESS to store recovered braking energy and find <b>an</b> <b>appropriated</b> <b>time</b> to deliver the stored energy back to the power network {{in such a way}} that peak power of every substations is reduced. Bangkok Mass Transit System (BTS)-Silom Line in Thailand is used to test and verify the proposed strategy. The results show that substation peak power is reduced by 63.49 % and net energy consumption is reduced by 15.56 % using coasting and deceleration trip time control.|$|R
