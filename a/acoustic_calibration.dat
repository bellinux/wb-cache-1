In particular the three acoustic signals associated with a line leak. The system is portable ({approx} 30 lbs) and is designed for line pressures up to 1000 psi. It has become apparent that cataloging of the various background acoustic signals in natural gas transmission line is very important if a system to identify leak signals is to be developed. The low-pressure (0 - 200 psig) laboratory test phase has been completed and a number of field trials have been conducted. Before the cataloging phase could begin, a few problems identified in field trials identified had to be corrected such as: (1) Decreased microphone sensitivity at line pressures above 250 psig.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{building}} a device that allows speech communication without the necessity of vocalizing has received considerable attention in the speech research community [1]. Such a device, called a « Silent Speech Interface » (SSI), {{could be used in}} situations where silence is required (as a silent cell phone), as well as by laryngectomized patients who can articulate normally but have lost the ability to vocalize speech. The main approaches described in the literature are based on (a) the capture of tongue and lips motion using ultrasound and video imaging, (b) the measurement of the muscle electrical activity using surface electromyography, and (c) the amplification of “non-audible murmurs”, using a stethoscopic microphone (NAM). In most of these studies, sensor data are mapped to various speech signal characteristics using statistical models (such as GMM or HMM). These models are trained on multimodal datasets associating articulatory activity with the corresponding audio signal. However, as shown in [2] and [3], the performance of these models trained on “vocalized speech ” decreases when they are used to decode “silent speech ” (if no model adaptation scheme is applied). This may reveal some differences in terms of articulatory strategies between these two production modes.

Although the liver scanning system {{has been shown to}} offer a safer alternative for diagnosing liver cirrhosis through stiffness measurement, as compared to the liver needle biopsy exam, the scanner’s accuracy has not been fully established. The Young’s elastic modulus values of 5 - 6 wt% PVA cryogel phantoms, also containing glycerol and 0. 3 μm Al 2 O 3 and 3 μm Al 2 O 3, were measured using a ‘gold standard’ mechanical testing technique and transient elastography. The mechanically measured values and acoustic velocities of the phantoms ranged between 1. 6 16. 1 kPa and 1540 1570 m/s, respectively, mimicking those observed in liver tissue. The values reported by the transient elastography system overestimated the Young’s elastic modulus values representative of the progressive stages of liver fibrosis by up to 32 %. These results were attributed to the relative rather than absolute nature of the measurement arising from the single-point <b>acoustic</b> velocity <b>calibration</b> of the system, rendering the measurements critically dependent on the speed of sound of the sample under investigation. Given the wide range of acoustic velocities which exist in the liver, spanning healthy tissue to cirrhotic pathology, coupled with the system’s assumption that the liver is approximately elastic when it is rather highly viscoelastic, care should be exercised when interpreting the results from this system in patient groups...|$|R

The aim of the scientific research is to investigate the possibilities of application of mechanical effects generated in dispersive waveguides to calibrate the low-frequency AET and to create measures for their calibration.

Measurement results demonstrate the proposed methods’ application possibilities for the generation of arbitrary type displacements in waveguides with dispersive properties. Advantages of new methods were shown in a comparative analysis between the existing and the proposed methods.
