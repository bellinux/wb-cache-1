25|$|These {{forms were}} {{previously}} considered independent disorders and were mainly classified among neuroses. A modern definition of dystonia was worded some years later, in 1984. During {{the following years}} it became evident that dystonia syndromes are numerous and diversified, new terminological descriptors (e.g., dystonia plus, heredodegenerative dystonias, etc.) and <b>additional</b> <b>classification</b> schemes were introduced. The clinical complexity of dystonia was then fully recognized.|$|E

2500|$|Hydrogels {{have been}} {{extensively}} studied, {{mainly in the}} entrapment of small molecules for drug delivery, including cases where the hydrogel nanoparticles slowly release the drug to a targeted site. Hydrogels can be classified [...] according their polymers constituents, which can be natural (Hyaluronan, alginic acid, pectin, , chondroitin sulfate, dextran and dextran [...] sulphate, chitosan, polylysine, [...] collagen, carboxymethyl chitin, fibrin, agarose, pullulan), or synthetic (PEG, PLA, PLGA, PCL, PHB, PVA, PNVP, P(HEMA), p(biscarboxy-phenoxy-phosphazene), p(GEMA-sulfate), and others), or a hybrid of the two. In addition to organic hydrogels there are sol-gels, which are oxygen-bridged silicates (or titanium oxide), that polymerise in water. An <b>additional</b> <b>classification</b> can be by method of polymerization, which can be physical (freezing or heating) or chemical (γ-ray, oxygen or photo-induced radical polymerization {{in the case of}} acrylates, vinyls and acrylamides).|$|E

25|$|In recent years, the {{official}} classification has been criticised {{by many of}} the top producers, and <b>additional</b> <b>classifications</b> have been set down by wine growers' organisations such as VDP, without enjoying legal protection.

50|$|In 1992, {{there was}} an <b>additional</b> <b>classification</b> because of the Maastricht Treaty, that created the European Union.

Followed to age 14-17 years, these groups of children showed differing outcomes, including some differences in central nervous system activity.

40|$|This is the Wetland {{resource}} {{evaluation and}} the NRA's role in its conservation: Classification of British wetlands report {{produced by the}} National Rivers Authority in 1995. This R&D document provides a clear classification for wetlands in England and Wales. The classification incorporates many of the existing ideas on the subject but avoids {{some of the problems}} associated with other classifications. A two-layered 'hydrotopographical' classification is proposed. The first layer identifies situation-types, i. e. the position the wetland occupies in the landscape, with special emphasis upon the principal sources of water. The second layer identifies hydrotopographical elements, i. e. units with distinctive water supply and, sometimes, distinctive topography in response to this. This system is seen as an independent, basic, classification upon which it is possible to superimpose <b>additional,</b> independent <b>classifications</b> based on other features (e. g. base-status, fertility, vegetation, management etc.). Some proposals for such <b>additional</b> <b>classifications</b> are provided...|$|R
2500|$|In 1990, the Japanese {{subsidiary}} of Tower Records defined J-pop as all Japanese music {{belonging to the}} Recording Industry Association of Japan except Japanese independent music (which they term [...] "J-indie"); their stores began to use <b>additional</b> <b>classifications,</b> such as J-club, J-punk, J-hip-hop, J-reggae, J-anime, and Visual kei by 2008, after independent musicians started to release works via major labels. Ito Music City, a Japanese record store, adopted expanded classifications including Group Sounds, idol of the 1970s–1980s, enka, folk and established musicians of the 1970s–1980s, {{in addition to the}} main J-pop genres.|$|R
50|$|Ludwig von Stockert (1913) {{proposed}} a classification of accidents by their effects (consequences); e.g. head-on collisions, rear-end collisions, derailments.

Similar categorisations {{had been made}} by implication in previous books e.g. Rolt (1956), but Stockert's and Schneider/Mase's are more systematic and complete. With minor changes, they represent best knowledge.|$|E
50|$|In the 1953 Tour de France, to {{celebrate}} the 50th birthday of the Tour de France, the points system was reintroduced, but this time as an <b>additional</b> <b>classification.</b> Because the leader in the general classification wears a yellow jersey, the leader in the points classification also received a special jersey, a green jersey (maillot vert). The color green was chosen because the sponsor was a lawn mower producer.|$|E
