40|$|Trademark image {{retrieval}} {{is becoming}} an important <b>application</b> <b>for</b> logo <b>registry,</b> verification, and design. There are two major problems about the current approaches to trademark image retrieval based on shape features. First, researchers often focus on using a single feature, e. g., Fourier descriptors, invariant moments or Zernike moments, without combining them for possible better results. Second, even if they combine the shape features, the weighting factors assigned to the various shape features are often determined with an ad hoc procedure. Hence, we propose to group different shape features together and suggest a technique to determine a suitable weighting factors for different shape features in trademark image retrieval. In this paper, we use a supervised learning method for finding the weighting factors in the dissimilarity function byintegrating five shape features using a genetic algorithm (GA). We tested the learned dissimilarity function using a database of 1360 [...] ...|$|R
50|$|A problem {{generally}} with state-run registries {{has been}} the lack of publicity surrounding them. In contrast, in April 2005, the state-run National Adoption Contact Preference Registerhttp://www.dadpeter.co.uk/forum was launched in Ireland with a national radio and newspaper advertising campaign, and included an <b>application</b> form <b>for</b> the <b>registry</b> being delivered to every household. The Irish registry allows a person using it to specify {{whether or not they}} want contact and/or reunion, what form that contact should take (e.g., letter, phone, e-mail), and, if they do not want contact at the time being, still allows for the passing of medical and/or background information to the other party.|$|R
40|$|Image {{retrieval}} {{based on}} image content {{has become a}} hot topic {{in the fields of}} image processing and computer vision. In this research, we focus on the problem of shape-based image retrieval in trademark database and Chinese cursive script character image database. There are two major problems about the current approaches to shape-based image retrieval. First, researchers usually focus on using a single feature, e. g., Fourier descriptors, invariant moments or Zernike moments, without combining them for possible better results. Second, even if they combine the shape features, the weights assigned to them are often determined with an ad hoc procedure. Hence, we propose to group different shape features together and suggest a supervised learning technique using genetic algorithm (GA) to determine a suitable weighting factor for each individual feature for image retrieval. Based on the proposed scheme, we have built two prototype systems. The systems achieve both the desired accuracy and efficiency. First, we handle the problem of shape-based image retrieval in trademark database. Trademark image retrieval is becoming an important <b>application</b> <b>for</b> logo <b>registry,</b> verification, and design. The number of trademarks is over one million now and is growing rapidly. Therefore, the task of registering a new trademark becomes difficult without inadvertent infringement of copyright of an existing trademark. In our system, we group different shape features including invariant moments, eccentricity, Fourier descriptors of approximated boundary, ii and circularity of approximated boundary together and we use the proposed supervised learning technique to determine the weights of the features. A trademark database with 1400 monochromatic images was tested. The retrieved images by our sys [...] ...|$|R

A critical factor to the overall utility of web services is a scalable, flexible and robust discover mechanism.

We also present two distributed and scale-well approaches <b>for</b> fully autonomous <b>registries</b> and cooperative registries to overcome the disadvantage of traditional registries. In other words, we provide an unstructured peer-to-peer network <b>for</b> fully autonomous <b>registries</b> and a structured peer-to-peer network <b>for</b> cooperative <b>registries.</b> The two kinds of peer-to-peer network <b>for</b> <b>registries</b> support complex query without influence on interoperability, and they are a suitable candidates to extend traditional web service registries...|$|R

40|$|We {{previously}} {{developed a}} deterministic record linkage algorithm demonstrating sensitivities approaching 90 % while maintaining 100 % specificity. 1 Substantially better performance {{has been reported}} using probabilistic linkage techniques; however, such methods often incorporate human review into the process. To avoid human review, we employed an estimator function using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to establish a single true-link threshold. We compared the unsupervised probabilistic results against the manually reviewed gold-standard <b>for</b> two hospital <b>registries,</b> as well against our previous deterministic results. At an estimated specificity of 99. 95 %, actual specificities were 99. 43 % and 99. 42 % <b>for</b> <b>registries</b> A and B, respectively. At an estimated sensitivity of 99. 95 %, actual sensitivities were 99. 19 % and 98. 99 % <b>for</b> <b>registries</b> A and B, respectively. The EM algorithm estimated linkage parameters with acceptable accuracy, and was an improvement over the deterministic algorithm.

40|$|AbstractThe term {{registry}} {{is widely}} {{used to refer to}} any database storing clinical information collected as a byproduct of patient care. Despite the use of this single characterizing term (registry), these databases exist in various forms and support functions ranging from biomedical informatics and clinical research, to public health, epidemiology and evidence-based clinical practice. This ambiguous terminology impacts the ability to locate and learn about specific types of registries; the goal of this research project was to develop a more useful categorization scheme <b>for</b> <b>registries.</b> We thoroughly analyzed peer-reviewed publications related to registries. From our findings, we created a detailed definition <b>for</b> <b>registries</b> in healthcare (medical data registries, or MDRs) and outlined a set of characteristics common to all such MDRs. This framework, MDR-OK, comprises five distinguishing features of registries, and is intended to provide a clear understanding of MDRs as a functional variety of databases, as well as to provide a framework for evaluation and categorization of registries and other data systems...|$|R
