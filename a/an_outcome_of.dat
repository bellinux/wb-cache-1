5|$|Weber's {{methodology}} {{was developed}} {{in the context of a}} wider debate about methodology of social sciences, the Methodenstreit. Weber's position was close to historicism, as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical contexts and its analysis required the understanding of subjective motivations of individuals (social actors). Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of comparative historical analysis. Therefore, Weber was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting <b>an</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> those processes in the future.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1850s, the Perushim felt ready to attempt the {{building}} a larger synagogue on he-Hasid's original site. <b>An</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> the Crimean War was the British Government's {{willingness to use}} its increased influence at Constantinople to intervene on behalf of its Jewish subjects who resided in Jerusalem. On July 13, 1854, James Finn of the British consulate in Jerusalem wrote to the British ambassador in Constantinople describing {{the wishes of the}} 2,000 strong Ashkenazic community to build a new synagogue. He noted that funds for construction had been collected by Moses Montefiore twelve years earlier. He also enclosed a 150-year-old firman, which authorised the Ashkenazic Jews to rebuild their ruined synagogue. As the title to the plot of land was held by the Amzalag family, who were British subjects, they designated London-born Rabbi Hirschell, son of Chief Rabbi of Great Britain Solomon Hirschell, to negotiate the transfer. The British consulate agreed to lend its sanction to the contract in order to avoid possible intrusion by the Turks. At issue was {{the question of whether the}} building of a synagogue at the site constituted the repair of an old house of non-Muslim worship or the establishment of a new synagogue. The Turks would have to grant a special license for the latter. This was received through the efforts of Francis Napier and Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, British ambassadors to the Sublime Porte, who secured the necessary firman in 1854. In July 1855, while in Constantinople, Montefiore was handed the firman, which he hand-delivered during his fourth visit to Jerusalem in 1857.|$|E

Thus electrochemistry deals with the interaction between electrical energy and chemical change.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To define {{standardised}} endpoints to aid {{the design}} of trials that compare antibiotic therapies for bloodstream infection (BSI). Methods: Prospective studies, randomised trials or registered protocols comparing antibiotic therapies for BSI, published from 2005 to 2016, were reviewed. Consensus endpoints for BSI studies were defined using a modified Delphi process. Results: Different primary and secondary endpoints were defined for pilot (small-scale studies designed to evaluate protocol design, feasibility and implementation) and definitive trials (larger-scale studies designed to test hypotheses and influence clinical practice), {{as well as for}} Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative BSI. For pilot studies of S. aureus BSI, <b>a</b> primary <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> success at day 7 was defined by: survival, resolution of fever, stable/improved Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clearance of blood cultures, with no microbiologically-confirmed failure up to 90 days. For definitive S. aureus BSI studies, <b>a</b> primary <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> success at 90 days was defined by survival and no microbiologically-confirmed failure. For pilot studies of Gram-negative BSI, <b>a</b> primary <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> success at day 7 was defined by: survival, resolution of fever and symptoms related to BSI source, stable or improved SOFA score and negative blood cultures. For definitive Gram-negative BSI studies, <b>a</b> primary <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> survival at 90 days supported by <b>a</b> secondary <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> success at day 7 (as previously defined) was agreed. Conclusions: These endpoints provide a framework to aid future trial design. Further work will be required to validate these endpoints with respect to patient-centered clinical outcomes...|$|R
