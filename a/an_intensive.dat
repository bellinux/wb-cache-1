5|$|Although no {{attendance}} {{records for}} the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile (400m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree, and the school would have provided <b>an</b> <b>intensive</b> education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.|$|E
5|$|Ayer, who {{had written}} several police {{procedural}} films previously, wanted the film {{to focus more on}} the friendship between partners and honest police work rather than corruption.

5|$|Getting It: The Psychology of est is a non-fiction book by American {{psychologist}} Sheridan Fenwick, {{first published}} in 1976, analyzing Werner Erhard's Erhard Seminars Training or est. It is based on Fenwick's own experience of attending a four-day session of the est training, <b>an</b> <b>intensive</b> 60-hour personal development course in the self-help genre. Large groups of up to 250 people took the est training at one time.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{care in the}} hospital, as in the prehospital setting, aims {{to ensure}} {{adequate}} airway, breathing, cardiovascular function, and spinal immobilization. Imaging of the spine to ascertain presence of SCI may need to wait if emergency surgery is needed to stabilize a life-threatening injury. Acute SCI merits treatment in <b>an</b> <b>intensive</b> care unit, especially injuries to the cervival spinal cord. Patients with SCI need repeated neurological assessments and treatment by neurosurgeons.|$|E
5|$|Respiratory failure {{may require}} {{intubation}} of the trachea and breathing support through mechanical ventilation, generally on <b>an</b> <b>intensive</b> care unit. The need for ventilatory support can be anticipated by measurement of two spirometry-based breathing tests: the {{forced vital capacity}} (FVC) and the negative inspiratory force (NIF). An FVC of less than 15ml per kilogram body weight or an NIF of less than 60cmH2O are considered markers of severe respiratory failure.|$|E

5|$|Those {{with severe}} {{encephalopathy}} (stages 3 and 4) {{are at risk}} of obstructing their airway due to decreased protective reflexes such as the gag reflex. This can lead to respiratory arrest. Transferring the person to a higher level of nursing care, such as <b>an</b> <b>intensive</b> care unit, is required and intubation of the airway is often necessary to prevent life-threatening complications (e.g., aspiration or respiratory failure). Placement of a nasogastric tube permits the safe administration of nutrients and medication.|$|E
5|$|After <b>an</b> <b>intensive</b> planning, maintenance, and {{briefing}} period, {{the mission}} was scheduled for January 1, 1967. Poor weather caused a 24-hour delay, but even then, a solid overcast covered the North Vietnamese airbases at Phúc Yên, Gia Lam, Kép, and Cat Bai when the bogus strike force began arriving over the target area, five-minute intervals separating the flights of F-4s. Leading the first flight, Olds overflew the primary MiG-21 base at Phúc Yên and was on a second pass when MiGs finally began popping up through the cloud base. Although at first seemingly random in nature, it quickly {{became apparent that the}} MiGs were ground-controlled intercepts designed to place the supposed F-105s in a vise between enemies to their front and rear.|$|E
5|$|After rescue, Bågenholm was {{transported by}} {{helicopter}} to the Tromsø University Hospital, where {{a team of}} more than a hundred doctors and nurses worked in shifts for nine hours to save her life. Bågenholm woke up ten days after the accident, paralyzed from the neck down and subsequently spent two months recovering in <b>an</b> <b>intensive</b> care unit. Although she has made an almost full recovery from the incident, late in 2009 she was still suffering from minor symptoms in hands and feet related to nerve injury. Bågenholm's case has been discussed in the leading British medical journal The Lancet, and in medical textbooks.|$|E

5|$|Bean {{starred in}} the espionage {{television}} series Legends as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. <b>An</b> <b>intensive</b> viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in Legends would not suffer the same fate. The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become so accustomed to dying on screen that he expects his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite {{the simplicity of the}} scene.|$|E
5|$|Following her {{attack on}} Ilissos, U-862 {{continued}} east along the Australian coastline, becoming the only German submarine {{to operate in}} the Pacific Ocean during the Second World War. After entering the Pacific U-862 scored her first success on this patrol when she attacked the U.S.-registered liberty ship Robert J. Walker off the South Coast of New South Wales on 24 December 1944. The ship sank the following day. Following this attack, U-862 evaded <b>an</b> <b>intensive</b> search by Australian aircraft and warships and departed for New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|In early March 1944, Parkinson became {{temporary}} {{major general}} and {{commander of the}} 2nd New Zealand Division after its nominal commander, Howard Kippenberger, was wounded. At the time, the New Zealanders, {{as part of the}} New Zealand Corps, were participating in the Battle of Monte Cassino. An offensive, largely planned by Kippenberger and involving the division, began on 15 March. Parkinson, already doubting the chances of a successful outcome, failed to follow Kippenberger's directions for dispersion of his troops and did not allow sufficient infantry to enter Monte Cassino immediately following <b>an</b> <b>intensive</b> air bombardment. Although later criticised for being overly cautious during the battle, he was awarded a bar to his DSO for his leadership during this time.|$|E
5|$|Mustelids {{have never}} colonised Stewart Island/Rakiura, but feral cats were present. During a survey, it was {{apparent}} that cats killed kakapo at a rate of 56% per year. At this rate, the birds could not survive on the island and therefore <b>an</b> <b>intensive</b> cat control was introduced in 1982, after which no cat-killed kakapo were found. However, to ensure the survival of the remaining birds, scientists decided later that this population should be transferred to predator-free islands; this operation was carried out between 1982 and 1997.|$|E
