5|$|A phase-to-amplitude {{converter}} (PAC), {{which uses}} the phase accumulator output word (phase word) usually as an index into a waveform look-up table (LUT) {{to provide a}} corresponding amplitude sample. Sometimes interpolation is used with the look-up table to provide better <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> reduce phase error noise. Other methods of converting phase to amplitude, including mathematical algorithms such as power series can be used, particularly in a software NCO.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine the criterion validity of EAS 4 visual speed <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> test. Score of EAS 4 visual speed <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> test was correlated with score of clerical speed <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> test from differential aptitude test (DAT) battery. The subjects of this research were 87 students of the Faculty of Psychology Ahmad Dahlan University. The data were obtained through EAS 4 visual speed <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> test <b>and</b> clerical speed <b>and</b> <b>accuracy</b> test (D 4). Quantitative analysis was done by SPSS version 15 software.

5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E
5|$|An atomic {{line filter}} (ALF) is an {{advanced}} optical band-pass filter {{used in the}} physical sciences for filtering electromagnetic radiation with precision, <b>accuracy,</b> <b>and</b> minimal signal strength loss. Atomic line filters work via the absorption or resonance lines of atomic vapors and so may also be designated an atomic resonance filter (ARF).|$|E
5|$|However, a rearguard action took England to a {{total of}} 165, before Johnston removed Alec Bedser to end the innings. Johnston {{finished}} with 5/36, in a display characterised by his <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> variations in pace and swing. When Australia batted, Johnston and Ernie Toshack wagged a last-wicket partnership of 33 runs in only 18 minutes. They played in a free-wheeling manner before Bedser trapped Toshack lbw to end the home team’s innings on 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead and Johnston unbeaten on 17.|$|E

Popular conceptions of dinosaurs have also been important in stimulating the interest and imagination of young people, and {{have been responsible for}} introducing many who would later become paleontologists to the field. In addition, popular depictions have the freedom to be more imaginative and speculative than technical works.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Bell {{began to}} lay off workers on the V-22 {{production}} line following the implementation of defense cuts, which had reduced the US order to about half the originally planned number of aircraft.

5|$|In each level, {{the player}} must {{complete}} certain objectives and then exit the stage. The requirements are varied, with many levels requiring the recovery {{and use of}} numerous high-tech gadgets. If Joanna is killed or fails an objective, the player must start the level again. Three distinct difficulty settings are available for each level, the choice of which will affect aspects such {{as the number of}} objectives that must be completed, enemy <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> damage, the effectiveness of the game's optional aiming assistance, and the availability of ammunition and protective shields. If all the levels are completed on the highest difficulty, an additional setting becomes available, allowing players to customise various aspects of enemies, such as their health, their aiming <b>accuracy</b> <b>and</b> the damage they inflict. In addition to the main campaign, there are four bonus missions, with three enabling the player to control other characters with unique special abilities. Players can also unlock cheats by completing the levels within certain time limits.|$|E
40|$|Measuring {{the small}} changes {{associated}} with long-term {{global climate change}} from space is a daunting task. To address these problems and recommend directions for improvements in satellite instrument calibration some 75 scientists, including researchers who develop and analyze long-term data sets from satellites, {{experts in the field}} of satellite instrument calibration, and physicists working on state of the art calibration sources and standards met November 12 - 14, 2002 and discussed the issues. The workshop defined the absolute <b>accuracies</b> <b>and</b> long-term stabilities of global climate data sets that are needed to detect expected trends, translated these data set <b>accuracies</b> <b>and</b> stabilities to required satellite instrument <b>accuracies</b> <b>and</b> stabilities, and evaluated the ability of current observing systems to meet these requirements. The workshop's recommendations include a set of basic axioms or overarching principles that must guide high quality climate observations in general, and a roadmap for improving satellite instrument characterization, calibration, inter-calibration, and associated activities to meet the challenge of measuring global climate change. It is also recommended that a follow-up workshop be conducted to discuss implementation of the roadmap developed at this workshop...|$|R
40|$|Several {{published}} reports show that instance-based learning algorithms yield high classification <b>accuracies</b> <b>and</b> have low storage requirements during supervised learning applications. However, these learning algorithms are highly sensitive to noisy training instances. This paper describes a simple extension of instance-based learning algorithms for detecting and removing noisy instances from concept descriptions. This extension requires evidence that saved instances be significantly good classifiers before it {{allows them to}} be used for subsequent classification tasks. We show that this extension's performance degrades more slowly in the presence of noise, improves classification <b>accuracies,</b> <b>and</b> further reduces storage requirements in several artificial and real-world database applications...|$|R
