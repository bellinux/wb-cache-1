The visiting team, under the captaincy of Bob Wyatt, was stronger than English teams that had previously toured the Caribbean; despite some shortcomings, Wisden <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>critics</b> considered it strong enough for the task in hand.|$|E

5|$|Chartjackers {{garnered}} a viewing figures peak {{of almost}} half a million with its final episode and was critically panned by reviewers. Some commentators felt that the programme's concept was ridiculous and doomed from the start, others felt that the series showed a contempt for music and the general public, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>critics</b> questioned whether {{the point of the}} project was to raise money for charity or for the four bloggers to promote themselves. The show was nominated for a 2010 Broadcast Digital Award in the Best Multi-Platform Project category, but lost out to The Operation...Surgery Live.|$|E
5|$|Daily fantasy {{sports have}} faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>critics</b> {{have argued that}} due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing {{the performance of their}} selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required familiarity with the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.|$|E
5|$|LGBT rights activists, {{human rights}} activists, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>critics</b> {{stated that the}} broad and vague wording of the law, which was {{characterized}} as a ban on gay propaganda by the media, made {{it a crime to}} publicly make statements or distribute materials in support of LGBT rights, hold pride parades or similar demonstrations, state that gay relationships are equal to heterosexual relationships, or according to Human Rights Campaign (HRC) president Chad Griffin, even display LGBT symbols such as the rainbow flag or kiss a same-sex partner in public. The first arrest made under the law involved a person who publicly protested with a sign containing a pro-LGBT message.|$|E

25|$|In 1975, E. O. Wilson {{published}} his controversial book , the subtitle {{alluding to the}} modern synthesis as he attempted to bring the study of animal society into the evolutionary fold. This appeared radically new, although Wilson was following Darwin, Fisher, Dawkins <b>and</b> <b>others.</b> <b>Critics</b> such as Gerhard Lenski noted that he was following Huxley, Simpson and Dobzhansky's approach, which Lenski considered needlessly reductive as far as human society was concerned. By 2000, the proposed discipline of sociobiology had morphed into the relatively well-accepted discipline of evolutionary psychology.|$|R
5|$|Response to the {{pre-emption}} by viewers <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>critics</b> was negative; {{the family}} members of several Jets players were unaware of the game's actual conclusion, while NBC received further criticism for its poor timing in displaying the final score of the game during the Heidi movie. NBC's president Julian Goodman formally apologized for the incident. The Jets and Raiders met again in the AFL Championship Game, with the Jets winning 27–23. They later defeated the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III.|$|E
5|$|Spokane {{offers an}} array of musical {{performances}} catering {{to a variety of}} interests. Spokane's local music scene, however, is considered somewhat lacking by the Spokane All-Ages Music Initiative <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>critics,</b> who have identified a need for a legitimate all-ages venue for music performances. The Spokane Symphony presents a full season of classical music, and the Spokane Jazz Orchestra, a full season of jazz music. The Spokane Jazz Orchestra, formed in 1962, is a 70-piece orchestra and non-profit organization.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1936 {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War, the Nygaardsvold Cabinet followed a policy of non-intervention in {{the conflict between the}} Spanish government and rebels led by General Franco. Koht's view of the matter was that Norway should not be involved in the conflict in any way; this became the policy of the government {{for the duration of the}} civil war. The government soon banned the sale or transfer of Norwegian arms, aircraft and ships to Spain. Koht himself promoted a ban on the use of Norwegian ships to transport arms, ammunition and aircraft to foreign countries in general, to ensure that there could be no Norwegian connection to any such items that were delivered to Spain. The strict non-intervention policy promoted by Koht and Prime Minister Nygaardsvold was heavily criticised by forces within the Labour Party. Martin Tranmæl, a central figure in the apparatus of the Labour Party and the editor of the party newspaper Arbeiderbladet, led the critics of the policy towards the conflict in Spain. Tranmæl <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>critics</b> saw the non-intervention policy of the government as giving equal standing to both the elected government of Spain and the rebels. Koht went to great lengths to avoid any direct Norwegian involvement in the conflict, especially trying to block Norwegians from travelling to Spain to join the International Brigades. On 19 September 1936, Koht attempted to have the League of Nations impose a ceasefire in Spain, to be followed by a popular referendum on the country's constitution. Koht's proposal received little support and failed.|$|E

25|$|In this view, {{countries}} may develop unsustainable economic bubbles or otherwise mishandle their national economies, and foreign exchange speculators made the inevitable collapse happen sooner. A relatively quick collapse {{might even be}} preferable to continued economic mishandling, followed by an eventual, larger, collapse.

500|$|Walpole's debt to Henry James is {{discernible}} in The Duchess of Wrexe (1914) and The Green Mirror (1917), but in {{the view}} of JBPriestley the two most potent influences on Walpole were the highly contrasting ones of Trollope <b>and</b> Dostoyevsky. <b>Other</b> <b>critics</b> noted the Trollopian influence; in 1923 Arthur St John Adcock commented: ...|$|R

25|$|Kucinich was {{involved}} in efforts {{to bring back the}} Fairness Doctrine, requiring radio stations to give liberal and conservative points of view equal time, which he <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>critics</b> of talk radio argue is not presently the case. Fellow Democrat Maurice Hichney, Vermont's independent Senator Bernie Sanders, and others have joined him in this effort. Conservatives have criticized these plans, alleging that what they believe to be a liberal-dominated Hollywood, academia, new media, and mainstream media would not be subject to these regulations.|$|E

Waters had been implementing Davis's policy of cross-training, under which nurses were in areas overstaffed on a particular shift were reassigned to departments that needed more nurses. Churchill was one of several employees who had voiced objections to the way the policy was being implemented.

25|$|In 1993, Scott {{directed}} True Romance costing just $13m, from {{a script}} by Quentin Tarantino. The cast included Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn, Val Kilmer and in bit roles, James Gandolfini and Samuel L.

25|$|In August, 2005 the Office of Special Counsel dropped Sternberg's {{religious}} discrimination complaint against the Smithsonian Institution. It {{was determined that}} as an unpaid {{research associate at the}} Smithsonian, Sternberg was not actually an employee, and thus the Office of Special Counsel had no jurisdiction. Nick Matzke, Jason Rosenhouse <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>critics</b> have commented that the Office of Special Counsel itself appears biased in its initial handling of the matter, given the links between the religious right and the Republican Party, with George W. Bush appointee James McVay authoring its opinion.|$|E
25|$|Tillman {{joined the}} Army Rangers and served several tours in combat {{before he was}} killed in the {{mountains}} of Afghanistan.

25|$|Individuals can {{criticize the}} {{government}} publicly or privately, {{but there are}} criminal penalties, including prison sentences, for libel and slander, and government officials have sought to use these against the political opposition <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>critics.</b> The government pressed criminal libel and slander charges against Elisa Carrio, head of the opposition Civic Coalition party, for accusing officials in 2004 of corruption. In September 2008 Carrio won a civil case brought by {{the son of a}} deceased Peronist leader whom she accused of being involved in official corruption, murder, and drug trafficking; it was the second such case she had won.|$|E
