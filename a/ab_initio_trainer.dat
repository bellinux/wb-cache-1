50|$|The PW-6 was {{designed}} to be an <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> <b>trainer</b> with the capability of providing cross-country training as well. It has handling and performance characteristics similar to the Politechnika Warszawska PW-5. In this way, it was envisaged that the transition to solo flying in the single-seater could be made sooner.|$|E

The RAF received a total of 735 Chipmunks, which were designated in British service as the de Havilland Chipmunk T.10; these aircraft had been manufactured in the United Kingdom by de Havilland, the parent company of de Havilland Canada.|$|E

The type remained in use as a trainer until the early 1970s, the last example being retired from service by the Canadian Armed Forces during 1972, three years after unification of the Canadian Armed Forces. The Chipmunk's long service was due, in part, to its fully aerobatic capabilities and superb flying characteristics, which had contributed towards pilots frequently referring to it as being [...] "a delight to fly".|$|R
50|$|The BAC Jet Provost is a {{dedicated}} jet-powered trainer aircraft; according to aviation publication Flight International, {{it has the}} distinction of being the first <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> jet <b>trainer</b> to be standardised by any air force. As designed, it was intended for the Jet Provost to replace, rather than accompany, the use of piston-engine trainer aircraft. Accordingly, with such use, the design of the Jet Provost incorporates numerous features to support students during training. The aerodynamic design deliberately avoids speed, instead focusing on favourable handling characteristics and ease of recovery from stall and spin conditions. An emphasis was placed on flexibility, enabling use of the type throughout a range of training operations.|$|R
