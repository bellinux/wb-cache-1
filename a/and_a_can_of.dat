2500|$|On 17 August 1985, Reyat {{became a}} third suspect once the receipt for the tuner {{was found with}} his name. On 6 November 1985, the RCMP raided the homes of {{suspected}} Sikh separatists Parmar, Reyat, Gill and Johal. [...] In a 4 1/2-hour interview, Reyat denied all knowledge of the test blast or even Parmar. After he was told the CSIS had seen both of them, he changed his story that Parmar really {{wanted to build a}} device powerful enough so that he could take the device back to India to destroy a bridge. He explained that the gunpowder in the test was a failure as the device fizzled. The search of Reyat's house produced a carton with an unusual green tape also found in the Narita blast <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>can</b> <b>of</b> Liquid Fire-brand starting fluid matching fragments found at the blast site, along with blasting caps and dynamite, including a pound of dynamite in a bag taken out its original tube casing, though none was consistent with blast residue.
