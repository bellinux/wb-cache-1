5|$|In 1937, {{work had}} progressed on {{extending}} Berwick Street eastwards, {{and it had}} been extended to Alday Street by November 1938. A new causeway to extend Berwick Street north over the Swan River, <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> truck route, was considered by the state government in 1940. The existing Causeway, from which Albany Road commenced, had experienced almost a doubling of traffic volume between 1930 and 1939. However, the new Causeway was eventually constructed adjacent to old Causeway, which was then demolished.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a parkway linking Baltimore and Washington {{date back}} to Pierre Charles L'Enfant's {{original}} layout for Washington D.C. in the 18th century but did not fully develop until the 1920s. Major reasons surrounding {{the need for a}} parkway included high accident rates on adjacent US1 and defense purposes before World War II. In the mid-1940s, plans for the design of the parkway were finalized and construction began in 1947 for the state-maintained portion and in 1950 for the NPS-maintained segment. The entire parkway opened to traffic in stages between 1950 and 1954. Following the completion of the B–W Parkway, suburban growth took place in both Washington and Baltimore. In the 1960s and the 1970s, there were plans to give the segment of the parkway owned by the NPS to the state <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> part of I-295 and possibly I-95; however, they never came through and the entire road is today designated as MD295, despite only being signed on the state portion. Between the 1980s and the 2000s, the NPS portion of the road was modernized. MD295 {{is in the process of}} being widened from four to six lanes, with more widening and a new interchange along this segment planned for the future.|$|E

25|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} siege of Sisak, the Ottomans {{were preparing to}} capture a stronghold near Sisak <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> base for their further incursions into Croatia. On 14 April Hasan Pasha started building the fort of Petrinja south of Brest. Material for its construction was prepared in advance and the fort was finished on 2 May. As he expected an attack on Bihać, Captain Krištof Obričan ordered the strengthening of city's defences in spring, but he was soon captured by the Ottomans while he supervised the work outside the city walls. Captain Josip Dornberg was appointed in his place, but as he was absent the command was temporarily given to Captain Joseph von Lamberg. At Lamberg's request, reinforcements numbering a hundred Uskoks arrived from Karlovac with food and ammunition. These were the last reinforcements Bihać received.|$|E

25|$|The Arabian Peninsula is {{an ancient}} massif {{composed}} of stable crystalline rock whose geologic structure developed concurrently with the Alps. Geologic movements caused the entire mass to tilt eastward and the western and southern edges to tilt upward. In the valley created by the fault, called the Great Rift, the Red Sea was formed. The Great Rift runs from the Mediterranean along {{both sides of the}} Red Sea south through Ethiopia and the lake country of East Africa, gradually disappearing in the area of Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Scientists analyzing photographs taken by United States astronauts on the joint United States-Soviet space mission in July 1975 detected a vast fan-shaped complex of cracks and fault lines extending north and east from the Golan Heights. These fault lines are believed to be the northern and final portion of the Great Rift and are presumed {{to be the result of}} the slow rotation of the Arabian Peninsula counterclockwise in a way that will, in approximately 10 million years, close off the Persian Gulf <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> lake.|$|E
25|$|Having {{collected}} abundant booty {{and numerous}} slaves, {{in the autumn}} Scipio moved to Utica. His intention was to capture the ancient Phoenician city <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> base for his further operations. The direct assault on the walls was repulsed {{even though it was}} supported by siege engines and the Roman fleet, so that the Romans had to undertake a regular siege of the city. The emergence of two large armies of the enemy effectively ended the siege very soon. These were the forces of Hasdrubal Gisgo and his son-in-law Syphax, who apparently did not hesitate anymore. Their numerical superiority (according to the tradition passed by ancient authors such as Polybius and Livy, the army of Hasdrubal amounted to more than 30,000 and that of Syphax was twice as many, but these numbers are considered as exaggerated by modern researchers) forced Scipio to retreat to a promontory not far from Utica, which was later called Castra Cornelia. He fortified the narrow neck of land and set his winter quarters, relying on supplies of corn and clothing that were being sent to him from Sicily, Sardinia and Iberia. Hasdrubal and Syphax built their separate camps some distance from Castra Cornelia.|$|E
