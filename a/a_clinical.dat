5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition can usually be made once <b>a</b> <b>clinical</b> history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward.

40|$|Background: Cerebral malaria is {{the most}} severe {{neurological}} complication of Falciparum malaria. It {{is associated with a}} significant risk of death and neurological sequelae. <b>A</b> biphasic <b>clinical</b> picture is associated with an even greater risk of neurological sequelae. Objective: To examine the incidence and <b>clinical</b> characteristics of <b>a</b> biphasic <b>clinical</b> course in children with cerebral malaria and to study its relationship with outcome Method: We undertook a retrospective study of children admitted to Kilifi District Hospital with a history of impaired consciousness and Falciparum infection between January 1994 and December 2004. We identified children with <b>a</b> biphasic <b>clinical</b> course and examined their clinical characteristics and outcome against that of those with <b>a</b> single <b>clinical</b> course. Results: Out of 587 children with cerebral malaria, 11 were found to have <b>a</b> biphasic <b>clinical</b> course often heralded by recurrence of seizures. This clinical pattern was associated with a greater incidence of neurological sequelae but no death. Conclusion: We speculate that <b>a</b> biphasic <b>clinical</b> course may occur due to recurrent seizures, co-morbidity and reperfusion of cerebral areas previously clogged by parasitized red blood cells. A prospective examination of this group may shed more light on causality and enlighten further on pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. © 2002 African Journal of Neurological Sciences.
