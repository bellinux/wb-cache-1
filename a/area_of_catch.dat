40|$|The work {{described}} in this research uses the commercial data <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> to illustrate the facilities that GIS may offer to fisheries management. Three different types of fisheries data (different in terms of original format, method of collection and geographical footprints) for Oman are presented and discussed. Data collection, manipulation, filtering and preparation for input to a relational database are discussed. The spatial integration of the data is problematic but essential. Two methods of data integration, the point and the area are used to solve this problem. Point and area data are used to display data {{at different levels of}} management and decision making. Alternative visualisations from the GIS are used including total catch distribution, catch per unit effort per unit area, fishing density, and spatio-temporal analysis. The analytical ability of the GIS is used to display the following results: preferred <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch,</b> expected <b>catch</b> per <b>area,</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> fish high quality habitat, unexploited areas, and <b>areas</b> suspected <b>of</b> overfishing. Hydro-biological data (marine-related data) such as sea surface temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and zooplankton biomass for the year 1995 with relation to catch are presented and discussed too. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> is found to be more within the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> the continental shelf that in the deep waters, being <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> large fish productivity as well as high zooplankton biomass.

It is apparent that catch per unit effort (CPUE) is exponentially correlated to the size <b>of</b> the fishing <b>area.</b> Evaluation <b>of</b> historical <b>catch</b> and effort data show that fishery yields at Paama are beginning to respond to the impact of effort. Estimates of yearly unexploited unexploitable biomass based on the rates of decline in CPUE varied from 32 to 57 tons in Paama and 21 to 36 in Ambae. Allen's (1984) model was used for these estimates on rates of natural mortality from 0. 25 to 0. 50. For an age of recruitment of three years, and a natural mortality of 0. 25, ranges of maximal sustainable yield are between 3. 4 to 18. 3 tons in Paama and between 2. 2 and 11. 5 tons in Ambae. As annual recorded catches are actually higher without a significant decline in annual catch, this suggests that equilibrium has yet to be achieved. Extrapolation <b>of</b> estimated <b>catch</b> rates per nautical mile of 200 meters isobath (where most fish occurs), to the entire number of nautical miles present in Vanuatu at this depth suggests that maximum sustainable yield isbetween 113. 2 to 603. 5 tons/year.
