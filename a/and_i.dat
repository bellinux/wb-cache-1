40|$|International audienceInhibitors of {{differentiation}} or DNA binding (Id) proteins {{have been}} shown to be involved in tumor growth, invasiveness, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Overexpression of Id proteins, especially Id 1, correlates with unfavorable clinical prognosis. Thus, they are attractive molecular targets for anticancer therapy. Overexpression of Id proteins mediates breast cancer metastasis to lung. Targeting <b>Id</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Id</b> 3 expression in breast cancer cells reduces breast cancer metastasis in animal models. Different breast tumors failed to grow and/or metastasize in mice. <b>Id</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Id</b> 3 preferentially dimerize with the key regulatory E-proteins which inhibit the expression of different tumor suppressor genes. Nevertheless, the inhibition of tumorigenic activities of <b>Id</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Id</b> 3 at protein level has never been studied. Here, we isolated a novel peptide aptamer, Id 1 / 3 -PA 7, specifically interacting with <b>Id</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Id</b> 3 from randomized combinatorial expression library using yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems. Intracellular delivered Id 1 / 3 -PA 7 co-localized to <b>Id</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Id</b> 3 <b>and</b> interfered with their functions. It repressed E 47 protein sequestration by <b>Id</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Id</b> 3, activated the E-box promoter and increased the expression level of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKN 1 A and CDKN 1 B) in a dose-dependent fashion, paralleled by the cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). These effects were counteracted by ectopically overexpressed <b>Id</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Id</b> 3. Peptide aptamer Id 1 / 3 -PA 7 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells MCF 7 and MDA-MB- 231. In conclusion, Id 1 / 3 -PA 7 could represent a nontoxic exogenous agent that can significantly provoke antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in breast cancer cells, which are associated with deregulated expression of <b>Id</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Id</b> 3...|$|R

40|$|P. S. and D. P. contributed {{equally in}} this study. As {{transcriptional}} regulators of basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription and non-bHLH factors, the inhibitor of differentiation (Id 1, Id 2, <b>Id</b> 3, <b>and</b> <b>Id</b> 4) proteins {{play a critical}} role in coordinated regulation of cell growth, differentia-tion, tumorigenesis, <b>and</b> angiogenesis. <b>Id</b> 1 regulates prostate cancer (PCa) cell proliferation, apoptosis, and androgen independence, but its clinical significance in PCa remains controversial. Moreover, there is lack of evidence on the expres-sion of <b>Id</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>Id</b> 3 in PCa progression. In this study we investigated the expression of <b>Id</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>Id</b> 3 <b>and</b> reevaluated the expression of Id 1 in PCa. We show that increased <b>Id</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Id</b> 3 protein expression is strongly associated with increasing grade of PCa. At the molecular level, we report that silencing either Id 1 or Id 3 attenuates cell cycle. Although structurally and mechanistically similar, our results show that both these proteins are noncompensatory at least in PCa progression. Moreover, through gene silencing approaches we show that <b>Id</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Id</b> 3 primarily attenuates CDKN 1 A (p 21) and CDKN 1 B (p 27), respec-tively. We also demonstrate that silencing Id 3 alone significantly attenuates proliferation of PCa cells as compared with Id 1. We propose that increased <b>Id</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Id</b> 3 expression attenuates all three cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKN 2 B,- 1 A, and- 1 B) resulting in a more aggressive PCa phenotype...|$|R
