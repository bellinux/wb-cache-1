25|$|In 1981, TVNZ held a telethon {{to raise}} funds for Teletext-encoding {{equipment}} used for the creation and editing of text-based broadcast services for the deaf. The service came into use in 1984 with caption creation and importing paid for as part of the public broadcasting fee until the creation of the NZ on Air taxpayer fund, which is used to provide captioning for NZ On <b>Air</b> <b>content,</b> TVNZ news shows and conversion of EIA-608 US captions to the preferred EBU STL format for only TVNZ 1, TV 2 and TV 3 with archived captions available to FOUR and select Sky programming. During the second half of 2012, TV3 and FOUR began providing non-Teletext DVB image-based captions on their HD service and used the same format on the satellite service, which has since caused major timing issues in relation to server load and the loss of captions from most SD DVB-S receivers, such as the ones Sky Television provides their customers. As of April 2, 2013, only the Teletext page 801 caption service will remain in use with the informational Teletext non-caption content being discontinued.|$|E
500|$|The {{purpose of}} the growing medium is [...] to provide support and to store water, oxygen and {{dissolved}} minerals to feed the plant. In the case of cacti, there is general agreement that an open medium with a high <b>air</b> <b>content</b> is important. When cacti are grown in containers, recommendations as to how this should be achieved vary greatly; Miles Anderson says that if asked to describe a perfect growing medium, [...] "ten growers would give 20 different answers". Roger Brown suggests a mixture of two parts commercial soilless growing medium, one part hydroponic clay and one part coarse pumice or perlite, {{with the addition of}} soil from earthworm castings. The general recommendation of 25–75% organic-based material, the rest being inorganic such as pumice, perlite or grit, is supported by other sources. However, the use of organic material is rejected altogether by others; Hecht says that cacti (other than epiphytes) [...] "want soil that is low in or free of humus", and recommends coarse sand as the basis of a growing medium.|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Emily Exton gave the episode a positive review, writing that {{it was fun to}} see [...] "the resemblances between all the moms and their kids" [...] and enjoyed Will Ferrell's cameo here. At the beginning of his review, Adam Mersel of TV Guide said that this episode was not funny and was [...] "amused, a bit confused, and left wanting more." [...] After recapping the episode he said that he took his comments back, explaining that the episode [...] "did have laughs." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepiwall for HitFix wrote this episode of 30 Rock [...] "wasn't a very funny episode of the show... yet it did some nice things in trying to pull Liz {{and some of the other}} characters back into reality." [...] Sepinwall commented that Tracy and Jenna's stories with their mothers were [...] "nice grounded moments for the show's two broadest main characters, and the sort of thing 30 Rock needs to do with them a few times a season." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad liked this episode better than the previous episode [...] "Argus", enjoyed Elaine Stritch's return as Jack's mother, and that Tracy's story with Novella Nelson was [...] "actually well done", explaining that his situation makes sense in the TGS world. The Houston Press Daniel Carlson wrote that [...] "The Moms" [...] was [...] "fun but lighter than <b>air,</b> <b>content</b> to string together a mild plot with a series of good jokes and callbacks." [...] Nick Catucci for New York magazine was positive about the episode, and reported that Tracy and Novella Nelson had the best chemistry of the night.|$|E

50|$|Soft serve is {{generally}} lower in milk-fat (3% to 6%) than ice cream (10% to 18%) and is produced at {{a temperature of}} about −4 °C compared to ice cream, which is stored at −15 °C. Soft serve contains air, introduced {{at the time of}} freezing. The <b>air</b> <b>content,</b> called overrun, can vary from 0% to 60% of the total volume of finished product. The amount of air alters the taste of the finished product. Product with low quantities of air has a heavy, icy taste and appears more yellow. Product with higher <b>air</b> <b>content</b> tastes creamier, smoother and lighter and appears whiter. The optimum quantity of air is determined by the other ingredients and individual taste. It {{is generally}} accepted that the ideal <b>air</b> <b>content</b> should be between 33% and 45% of volume. More than this and the product loses taste, tends to shrink as it loses air and melts more quickly than that with less air.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effects of {{different}} <b>air</b> voids <b>content</b> on the resilient modulus, abrasion loss and permeability of porous asphalt mixture. One of the main issues with porous asphalt mixture is having an adequate amount of <b>air</b> voids <b>content</b> for its performance. High <b>air</b> voids <b>content</b> will increase the infiltration rate but reduces its durability and vice versa. Gyratory compacted samples were fabricated at various <b>air</b> void <b>contents</b> i. e. 17. 5 %, 20 % and 22. 5 % using aggregate gradations adopted from Australian and Singaporean specifications. The samples were tested for permeability, resilient modulus and abrasion loss. From the analysis, {{it was found that}} the increase in the voids content improves the permeability but adversely affects the resilient modulus and the mixture's performance under abrasion. The resilient modulus and abrasion loss show similar pattern at low <b>air</b> voids <b>content</b> where no significant difference between both mixture types but at high voids content, finer compositions shows to be more durable. Therefore, it can be concluded that the <b>air</b> voids <b>content</b> influences the performance of porous asphalt mixtures...|$|R

40|$|Ten {{miles of}} U. S. Highway 20 in Webster County {{began to show}} {{deterioration}} in 1990. Any deterioration was unexpected, since the road was just constructed in 1986 and 1987.

Evaluation of cores from the project reveal low <b>air</b> <b>contents</b> at those locations where cracking is occurring. The cause of the low <b>air</b> <b>contents</b> can only be speculated on.
