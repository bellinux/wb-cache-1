5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E

2500|$|In German {{the word}} Lichtung means <b>a</b> <b>clearing,</b> as in, for example, <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> in the woods. Since its root is the German word for light (Licht), it is {{sometimes}} also translated as [...] "lighting," [...] and in Heidegger's work {{it refers to the}} necessity of <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> in which anything at all can appear, the clearing in which some thing or idea can show itself, or be unconcealed. Note the relation that this has to Aletheia (see the main article or the entry above) and disclosure.|$|R

The importance of death ceremony in Toraja culture has characterised their languages to express intricate degrees of grief and mourning. The Toraja language contains many terms referring to sadness, longing, depression, and mental pain. Giving <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> expression of the psychological and physical effect of loss is a catharsis and sometimes lessens the pain of grief itself.|$|E
