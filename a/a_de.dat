40|$|The {{chemotactic}} {{activity of}} human C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg is enhanced significantly by an anionic polypeptide (cochemotaxin) in normal human serum and plasma. We {{have found that}} the cochemotaxin attaches to the oligosaccharide chain of native C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg to form a complex with potent chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Although capable of enhancing the chemotactic activity of native C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg, the cochemotaxin had no effect on the chemotactic activity of either deglycosylated C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg, native C 5 a, or N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Of the known components of the oligosaccharide chain, only sialic acid prevented enhancement by the cochemotaxin of the chemotactic activity exhibited by native C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg.

40|$|C 5 L 2 {{is a new}} {{cellular}} receptor {{found to}} interact with the human anaphylatoxins complement factor C 5 a and its C-terminal cleavage product C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg. The classical human C 5 a receptor (CSaR) preferentially binds C 5 a, with a 10 - 100 -fold lower affinity for C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg. In contrast, C 5 L 2 binds both ligands with nearly equal affinity. C 5 aR presents acidic and tyrosine residues in its N terminus that interact with the core of C 5 a while a hydrophobic pocket formed by the transmembrane helices interacts with residues in the C terminus of C 5 a. Here, we have investigated the molecular basis for the increased affinity of C 5 L 2 for C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg. Rat and mouse C 5 L 2 preferentially bound C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg, whereas rodent C 5 aR showed much higher affinity for intact C 5 a. Effective peptidic and non-peptidic ligands for the transmembrane hydrophobic pocket of C 5 aR were poor inhibitors of ligand binding to C 5 L 2. An antibody raised against the N terminus of human C 5 L 2 did not affect the binding of C 5 a to C 5 L 2 but did inhibit C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg binding. <b>A</b> chimeric C 5 L 2, containing the N terminus of C 5 aR, had little effect on the affinity for C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg. Mutation of acidic and tyrosine residues in the N terminus of human C 5 L 2 revealed that 3 residues were critical for C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg binding but had little involvement in C 5 a binding. C 5 L 2 thus appears to bind C 5 a and C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg by different mechanisms, and, unlike C 5 aR, C 5 L 2 uses critical residues in its N-terminal domain for binding only to C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg...|$|R

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that C 5 {{fragments}} induce an inflammatory reaction when instilled into the rabbit lung. Because C 5 a is rapidly converted to C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg in vivo, experiments were performed to determine which fragment was most effective in producing pulmonary inflammation in this animal model. C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg consistently produced marked inflammation. This was characterized by neutrophil accumulation, edema, hemorrhage, fibrin formation, and damage to alveolar epithelium. The time course of the inflammatory reaction initiated by C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg showed pulmonary vascular sequestration of neutrophils with no intra-alveolar migration at 30 minutes after injection. By 2 hours, interstitial and alveolar neutrophils were numerous, with the accumulation of neutrophils in the alveoli increasing to a maximum at 6 hours. At 24 and 48 hours, the predominant cells were mononuclear (macrophages). By 120 hours, the lesions were resolving. In contrast, at all doses examined, a similar instillation of C 5 a induced either no inflammation or a milder, more focal response than C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg. This inability of C 5 a to initiate inflammation was not apparently due to the generation of inhibitors, since mixtures of C 5 a and C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg were phlogistic. A prolonged, intrapulmonary infusion of C 5 a (20 minutes), in contrast to a bolus instillation (1 minute), did initiate an inflammatory response, which may reflect the conversion of the C 5 a to C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg in the lung. This study points out the inflammatory potential of products of complement activation, particularly of the C 5 fragment C 5 <b>a</b> <b>des</b> Arg, when applied to the airway side of the lungs. This inflammatory response raises the possibility that cleavage of intrapulmonary C 5 may {{play an important role in}} the initiation of pulmonary inflammation...|$|R
