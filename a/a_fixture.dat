40|$|Manufacturing and {{assembly}} processes often require objects {{to be held}} {{in such a way that}} they can resist all external wrenches. The problem of "fixture planning" is to compute, for a given object and <b>a</b> set of <b>fixturing</b> elements, the set of placements of the fixturing elements that constrain all finite and infinitesimal motions of the object (due to applied wrenches). <b>As</b> <b>fixturing</b> problems occur frequently in manufacturing {{and assembly}}, it becomes costly to build <b>a</b> dedicated <b>fixturing</b> solution for each different problem. Modular fixturing toolkits offer the advantage of reusability of the fixturing elements and have therefore gained considerable popularity. <b>A</b> modular <b>fixturing</b> toolkit consists of <b>a</b> <b>fixturing</b> table with <b>a</b> rectangular grid of holes, and <b>a</b> set of <b>fixturing</b> elements whose positions are restricted to the holes in the table.
