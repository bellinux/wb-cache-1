25|$|Sandy shores harbour {{a variety}} {{of plants and animals}} which are buried in the sand. Birds such as curlews and oyster {{catchers}} are to be seen prodding the sand to find these creatures for food. A few cormorants and fulmars breed along the coast where stonechats and rock pipits can also be spotted. Herring gulls are the commonest breeding birds and <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> sight nesting in the chimneys of coastal towns.|$|E
25|$|Geosynthetic clay liners, or GCLs, <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> {{juxtaposition}} of polymeric materials and natural soils. They are rolls of factory fabricated thin layers of bentonite clay sandwiched between two geotextiles or bonded to a geomembrane. Structural {{integrity of the}} subsequent composite is obtained by needle-punching, stitching or adhesive bonding. GCLs are used as a composite component beneath a geomembrane or by themselves in geoenvironmental and containment applications {{as well as in}} transportation, geotechnical, hydraulic, and many private development applications.|$|E

25|$|The {{nitrogen}} fixing Rhizobia <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> case, wherein conjugative elements naturally {{engage in}} inter-kingdom conjugation. Such elements as the Agrobacterium Ti or Ri plasmids contain elements that can transfer to plant cells. Transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories {{for the production}} of opines, which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources. Infected plant cells form crown gall or root tumors. The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant.|$|E
25|$|In physics, colloids <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> {{model system}} for atoms. Micrometre-scale {{colloidal}} particles are {{large enough to}} be observed by optical techniques such as confocal microscopy. Many of the forces that govern the structure and behavior of matter, such as excluded volume interactions or electrostatic forces, govern the structure and behavior of colloidal suspensions. For example, the same techniques used to model ideal gases can be applied to model the behavior of a hard sphere colloidal suspension. In addition, phase transitions in colloidal suspensions can be studied in real time using optical techniques, and are analogous to phase transitions in liquids. In many interesting cases optical fluidity is used to control colloid suspensions.|$|E
25|$|In 1912 on {{the islands}} lived 10 250 Greeks and 670 Turks. The islands have {{become more and more}} ethnically Turkish in {{character}} due to the influx of wealthy Turkish jetsetters, a process which began in the first days of the Turkish Republic when the British Yacht Club on Büyükada was appropriated as Anadolu Kulübü, for Turkish parliamentarians to enjoy Istanbul in the summer. The islands <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> anomaly because they allow for a very rare, albeit incomplete, insight into a multicultural society in modern Turkey, possibly akin to the multicultural society that once existed during the Ottoman Empire in places such as nearby Istanbul/Constantinople. Prior to the 1950s, each of the inhabited islands had significant communities of ethnic minorities of Turkey, which is now the case to a much smaller extent. Since {{the vast majority of the}} residents and visitors are Turkish, today their legacy is of cultural rather than demographic importance.|$|E

If {{there are other}} guests, their characters <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> study; their conversation is exciting and strange; the absence of all local narrowness both in the host and his chosen society gives a metropolitan, almost a cosmopolitan freedom and largeness to the talk. Hunsden himself is a polite man in his own house: he has, when he chooses to employ it, an inexhaustible power of entertaining guests; his very mansion too is interesting, the rooms look storied, the passages legendary, the low-ceiled chambers, with their long rows of diamond-paned lattices, have an old-world, haunted air: in his travels he has collected stores of articles of VERTU, which are well and tastefully disposed in his panelled or tapestried rooms: I have seen there one or two pictures, {{and one or two}} pieces of statuary which many an aristocratic connoisseur might have envied.|$|E
