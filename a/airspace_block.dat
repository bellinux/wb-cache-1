40|$|International audienceFunctional <b>{{airspace}}</b> <b>blocks</b> (FAB) {{concept is}} {{adopted by the}} European airspace to allows cooperation between airspace users to manage the air traffic flow, while ensuring efficiency, safety, and fairness without constraints of geographical boundaries. This integration of airspace introduces more flexibility to manage aircraft trajectory and airspace usage. In this paper, we propose a distributed air traffic flow management model to address four-dimensional trajectory planning over the European FAB. The goal is to enable effective information sharing between <b>airspace</b> <b>blocks</b> in strategic planning, and to minimize interaction between trajectories. The proposed model and overall methodology is implemented and tested with a full day air traffic data over the European airspace.

40|$|The European {{air traffic}} {{management}} (ATM) systems handles approximately 26, 000 flights daily. Forecasts indicate that the European air traffic levels going to be double by 2020. In addition, European ATM costs an additional 2 - 3 billion every year, compared to other similar systems in the world. 1 Taking into account this scenario, European ATM systems {{have to look for}} solutions for accommodates the increasing air traffic flows in the future airspaces, whilst cutting costs and improving its performance. One of these solutions came with the initiative of organizing airspace into functional blocks, according to traffic flows rather than to national borders. Such a project was not possible without common rules and procedures at European level. 1 The establishment of Functional Airspace blocks (FAB) shall enable optimum use of airspace taking into account air traffic flows. In the same way, FABs initiatives contain a new philosophy for design the airspace, the new airspace structures include application of Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA) concept, Free Route Airspace (FRA) blocks, night direct routes implementation, etc. Additionally, FAB blocks look for cooperation or fusion between Air Navigation Services providers (ANPs), all this with the goal of reduce air navigation services costs for users. Particularly, Free Route Airspace concept offers enormous benefits to airspace users, because permits to select the user-preferred trajectories with the optimal flight profile, enabling flights to operate outside a pre-defined route structure, resulting in shortest routes and big distances saving for airlines. Furthermore, free route blocks will significantly impact in ATC systems, changing the way for establish aircraft separation in these new airspace structures. For all these reasons, this thesis will study the functionality of the future Southwest Functional <b>Airspace</b> <b>Block</b> (SW FAB), specially the implementation of the Free Route Airspace concept, focused in the long term phase (2020) that includes Santiago-Asturias, Lisbon, Santa Maria Oceanic and Canarias airspaces in one free route <b>airspace</b> <b>block.</b> 2 Objectives 1. -Evaluate the Free Route <b>Airspace</b> <b>block</b> in the future Southwest Functional <b>Airspace</b> <b>Block</b> in terms of flight efficiency (fuel,CO 2,NM), ATC workload****. 2. -Study the interaction between Free Route Airspace and conventional airspace divided in sectors (flying with RNAV). 3. -Explore the future systems and procedures for traffic separation in Free route airspace. Methodology As was explained before, this thesis pretend to make an analysis of the free route airspace in the future SW FAB, for achieves this goal it will be necessary, firstly to explain the main concepts and background of: Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA), Functional <b>Airspace</b> <b>Block</b> (FAB) and Free Route Airspace (FRA), and others concepts. In the same way, {{it will be necessary to}} review the phases of the future SW (Spain-Portugal) FAB main plan; all concepts will help to settle the base for the future analysis in the thesis. Secondly, this thesis will propose and simulate the future Free route airspace in the SW FAB. The simulation pretends to evaluate the advantages and possible problems of this new way of flight. Thirdly, this project will include some interviews from ATC professionals; these interviews pretend to see how will impact the FRA (Free route airspace) in the future, additionally those interviews can provide different points of view and needs in the ATM (Air traffic management) system. Finally this master thesis will include an exhaustive analysis of results (concepts, simulation, interviews, etc.) and a presentation of conclusion...|$|E

40|$|With the {{continuous}} air traffic growth {{and limits of}} resources, {{there is a need}} for reducing the congestion of the airspace systems. Nowadays, several projects are launched, aimed at modernizing the global air transportation system and air traffic management. In recent years, special interest has been paid to the solution of the airspace sectorization problem. This thesis is devoted to studying the airspace sectorization in Europe and the possibilities to improve it. The airspace sectorization needs to be optimized with the support of automation in order to increase an adaptability of airspace sector configurations to the new traffic demands. The aim of the first part of this thesis is to propose a global method for the sector design of the European airspace based on a mathematical modeling and heuristic optimization methods. The proposed resolution method to solve the sector design problem is based on the initial division of the airspace into Voronoi cells using k-means clustering algorithm. Then, due to the induced combinatorial complexity, a stochastic optimization method is applied to solve the sector design problem. Resolution method based on metaheuristic algorithm called Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been developed to build airspace sectors in several control areas of Europe, involving traffic data for several days. Furthermore, airspace sector configurations need to be dynamically adjusted to provide maximum efficiency and flexibility in response to changing weather/traffic conditions. The objective of the second part of this thesis is to automatically adapt the airspace configurations according to the evolution of traffic. In order to reach this objective, the airspace is considered to be divided into predefined 3 D <b>airspace</b> <b>blocks</b> which have to be grouped or ungrouped depending on the traffic situation. The resolution method based on the graph partitioning technique and on the metaheuristic algorithm (GA) has been developed to generate a sequence of sector configurations, composed of the predefined <b>airspace</b> <b>blocks.</b> The overall methodology, is implemented and tested with air traffic data taken for one day of operation and for several different airspace control areas of Europe...|$|R

5000|$|German {{air traffic}} of today {{comprises}} between 1000 and 2000 aircraft tracks {{at the same}} time in the national airspace. Besides classical ATC radars also new types of sensors or position information sources like Multilateration, ADS-B, and others are to be integrated. Per day it is required to process up to 10000 flight plans. In the context of the discussion and development of transnational functional <b>airspaces</b> <b>block</b> like FABEC the required number of maintainable tracks will even grow beyond the 3000, possibly more than 5000 simultaneous tracks. An equivalent growth in needed flightplan handling capacity can be reasonably assumed. Each aircraft needs suitable Kalman filtering for tracking to cope both with steady flight and manoeuvre conditions in the different airspaces, and each IFR aircraft needs linkage processing to correlate flightplan data correctly to the track; simple code-callsign-pairing is insufficient due to multiple use of SSR codes.|$|R

40|$|The future {{airspace}} has {{to provide}} a reliable infrastructure and operational concept to ensure efficient and safe operations considering both flight-centric operations and the integration of new entrants. We propose an approach for a dynamic sectorization to manage the air traffic demand and flow appropriately. Our dynamic sectorization results in enhancements of the current operational structure (less deviation in controller task load) and leads to a significantly lower controller task load for the newly created airspace. Since future 4 D trajectory management demands an efficient consideration of operational (e. g. temporally restricted areas), ecological (e. g. contrail prevention) and economic (e. g. functional <b>airspace</b> <b>blocks)</b> constraints, our dynamic sectorization method contributes to the highly flexible use of current and future airspace.
