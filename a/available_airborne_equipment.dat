40|$|The {{problem of}} space debris {{utilization}} is quite relevant nowadays {{and has a}} global character. The space industry experts {{from all over the}} world are working on the task of removing space debris.

The set of <b>airborne</b> <b>equipment</b> includes a global navigation satellite system receiver, an inertial navigation system and a laser radar. To study the accuracy characteristics of the proposed method under different initial conditions a series of simulations was performed.

Stringent requirements for the accuracy of determining the orientation of the coordinate frame of the space vehicle are essential for providing the accuracy characteristics of the method...|$|R
