5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the river, the Millennium Bridge {{was opened}} in 2001. There {{was once a}} ferry at this point, before 1865, which gave access to the Victoria Dock, opened in 1850. South Bridge {{replaced}} the ferry in 1865, {{making it easier for}} workers to reach the dock. The swing footbridge was closed in 1934, but was not demolished until 1944.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{thatched}} {{houses in}} Little Thetford {{was destroyed by}} fire. Reported in the Cambridge Chronicle 6 November 1930, {{the cause of the}} fire at the c.13th-century six-room building was not known. Fireworks were being discharged <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the village. All that remained were burnt beams and smouldering walls, which were apparently made of old fen-mud. The villagers saved the nearby Three Horseshoes public house, by forming a bucket chain, and pouring water on its thatched roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{basement}} {{consists of}} an arcade of cloisters on three sides, surrounding several vaulted rooms including the sacristy, chapter house and warming house. These rooms were situated under the original dormitory. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the building, below what was formerly the abbess' chambers and the great hall, are two rooms and the main passage. On the north side, underneath the original refectory, is the undercroft.|$|E

5|$|The first flames {{were spotted}} at 6:00pm, {{under the door}} of the House of Lords, by the wife of one of the doorkeepers; she entered the chamber to see Black Rod's box alight, and flames burning the {{curtains}} and wood panels, and raised the alarm. For 25 minutes the staff inside the palace initially panicked and then tried to deal with the blaze, but they did not call for assistance, or alert staff at the House of Commons, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the palace complex.|$|E
5|$|Oba Chandler (October 11, 1946November 15, 2011) was an American man {{convicted and}} {{executed}} for the June 1989 triple murders of Joan Rogers {{and her two}} daughters, whose bodies were found, with their hands and feet bound, floating in Tampa Bay, Florida. Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive, with ropes around their necks with a concrete block tied <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the rope. The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted, on billboards, enlarged copies of the suspect's handwriting recovered on a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the handwriting. This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S.; billboards became useful tools in searches for missing people.|$|E

5|$|Some {{very large}} events known as fests (short for festival) have {{hundreds}} or thousands of participants who are usually split into competing character factions camped separately around a large venue. There are relatively few fests in the world, all based in Europe and Canada; however, their size means that they have a significant influence on local LARP culture and design. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the size scale, some small events known as linear or line-course LARPs feature a small group of PCs facing a series of challenges from NPCs and are often more tightly planned and controlled by GMs than other styles of LARP.|$|E
5|$|The French {{approach}} to funding memorials also relied mainly on voluntary fundraising, but featured {{a greater role}} for the state. A law passed in 1919 provided for a subsidy from central government to local authorities to assist in building memorials; the money was distributed {{in proportion to the}} number of local citizens who had died in the war. Nonetheless the largest French projects, such as the Ossuary of Douaumont, were still paid for mostly through private fund raising across France and the international community: it could take many years to raise the sums required. The Ossuary cost 15 m francs to build; <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the scale, more modest urban memorials cost around 300,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|The M-64 {{designation}} {{was used}} on two other separate highways {{before it was}} used for the current highway. The first was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the state near the Ohio state line, and the second was on the Keweenaw Peninsula near Eagle Harbor. The current highway has carried the M-64 moniker since 1930, when it was assigned along two disconnected highways. These two parts were joined into a single corridor soon after. M-64 {{was one of the last}} highways in the state of Michigan to be paved in 1961. In the early part of the 21st century, the state replaced the bridge over the Ontonagon River and shifted the highway's northern terminus.|$|E

5|$|The Stanley Cup final between Montreal and Toronto went five games, but is {{remarkable}} as each game required overtime to be decided. In the third game, with the series tied at one game a piece, Kennedy both saved {{the game for}} the Leafs and won it. First, he prevented a goal by clearing a puck that was heading into the Toronto net, then, just fifty seconds later <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the rink, he intercepted a clear-out pass from Montreal's Calum MacKay and scored to win the game. The fourth game was won by Toronto to lead the series 3–1.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} is {{a host of}} {{the widespread}} moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae, and of the louse Philopterus reguli. The amblycerous mite Ricinus frenatus has been found on the eastern goldcrest subspecies, R. r. japonensis in Japan, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the range in birds of the nominate subspecies on the Faroes and in Spain. These lice move over the host's body, and have strong mouthparts that pierce the host's skin {{so that they can}} feed on blood, and sometimes feather material. A number of feather mites have been recorded in the genus Regulus; these mites live on fungi growing on the feathers. The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the keratin of the outer feathers or on feather oil.|$|E
5|$|The planned {{buildings}} {{included a}} government center occupying all of Wallace Field, which extends from Rizal Park {{to the present}} Taft Avenue. The Philippine Capitol was to rise at the Taft Avenue end of the field, facing toward the sea. Along with buildings for various government bureaus and departments, it would form a quadrangle with a lagoon {{in the center and}} a monument to José Rizal <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the field. Of Burnham's proposed government center, only three units—the Legislative Building and the buildings of the Finance and Agricultural Departments—were completed when World War II erupted.|$|E

5|$|The {{throwing}} {{became more}} intense as kick-off approached. Moments later, {{a group of}} Liverpool fans charged into section Z, causing the fans there to retreat. As they had nowhere to go, they moved towards the side perimeter wall. As more people moved up against the wall, it collapsed, which resulted in 39 deaths and injuries to 600 people. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the ground, Juventus fans began to riot {{in retaliation for the}} events in section Z. They advanced down the pitch towards the Liverpool fans and were stopped by the police. The resulting confrontation lasted two hours and was still ongoing when the match kicked-off.|$|E
5|$|There was major {{restoration}} {{work done}} to the church in 1886, and {{a large amount of}} the Chancel woodwork dates from this period. During the restoration the east window was also replaced; it now depicts the stylised form of Saint Oswald, flanked on either side by Saint Aidan, and Saint Cuthbert, both Christian saints of the same era, and who helped him in missionary work in the Kingdom of Northumbria. These windows are directly opposite the western window, above the font <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the church, which depicts the queen at the time, Queen Victoria. Further modern additions to the church {{can be seen in the}} bell turret and organ chamber, as well as the south porch, which is currently the sole congregational entrance to the church. The church uses an electric organ during services.|$|E
5|$|Ajax {{opened the}} scoring {{in the third}} minute when Cees de Wolf, who was making his debut for Ajax, scored. A throw-in by Cruyff was headed into the air, Liverpool goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence came to collect the ball. Realising he could not reach it, he moved back towards his goal, but de Wolf outjumped defender Chris Lawler to head {{the ball into the}} Liverpool goal. The {{conditions}} were so poor, that the crowd celebrated in stages. Those closest to the goal celebrated immediately, while those <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the stadium reacted to these celebrations. Liverpool striker Hunt had a chance to score in the 12th minute, but his shot was saved by Ajax goalkeeper Gert Bals. Following the goal Ajax continued to attack, midfielder Sjaak Swart ran past three Liverpool players before passing the ball to Klaas Nuninga, whose shot was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Lawrence. However, Lawrence dropped the ball near Johan Cruyff, who scored to give Ajax a 2–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|Bivalves {{inhabit the}} tropics, {{as well as}} {{temperate}} and boreal waters. A number of species can survive and even flourish in extreme conditions. They are abundant in the Arctic, about 140 species being known from that zone. The Antarctic scallop, Adamussium colbecki, lives under the sea ice <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the globe, where the subzero temperatures mean that growth rates are very slow. The giant mussel, Bathymodiolus thermophilus, and the giant white clam, Calyptogena magnifica, both live clustered around hydrothermal vents at abyssal depths in the Pacific Ocean. They have chemosymbiotic bacteria in their gills that oxidise hydrogen sulphide, and the molluscs absorb nutrients synthesized by these bacteria. The saddle oyster, Enigmonia aenigmatica, is a marine species {{that could be considered}} amphibious. It lives above the high tide mark in the tropical Indo-Pacific on the underside of mangrove leaves, on mangrove branches, and on sea walls in the splash zone.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday 1 July 1871, {{an opening}} banquet was {{attended}} by the Prime Minister William Gladstone, {{who was also a}} shareholder. The following Monday, Mansion House opened and the District began running its own trains. From this date, the two companies operated a joint inner circle service between Mansion House and Moorgate Street via South Kensington and Edgware Road that ran every ten minutes. This was supplemented by a District service every ten minutes between Mansion House and West Brompton, and Hammersmith & City Railway and Great Western Railway (GWR) suburban services between Edgware Road and Moorgate Street. The permissions for the railway east of Mansion House were allowed to lapse. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the line, the District part of South Kensington station opened on 10 July 1871 and Earl's Court station opened on the West Brompton extension on 30 October 1871.|$|E
5|$|The constellation's two {{brightest}} stars—Alpha and Epsilon Antliae—shine with {{a reddish}} tinge. Alpha is an orange giant of spectral type K4III {{that is a}} suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. It is located 370 ± 20 light-years away from Earth. Estimated to be shining with around 480 to 555 times the luminosity of the Sun, it is most likely an ageing star that is brightening and {{on its way to}} becoming a Mira variable star, having converted all its core fuel into carbon. Located 710 ± 40 light-years from Earth, Epsilon Antliae is an evolved orange giant star of spectral type K3 IIIa, that has swollen to have a diameter about 69 times that of the Sun, and a luminosity of around 1279 Suns. It is slightly variable. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Antlia, Iota Antliae is likewise an orange giant of spectral type K1 III.|$|E
