500|$|In 2008, Christman {{was engaged}} in {{traveling}} around the world lecturing about Scientology and gave media interviews about the subject.

In February 2008, Christman appeared on the National Public Radio program Morning Edition in <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>about</b> the protest movement against Scientology called Project Chanology started by the Internet-based group Anonymous; she said she objected to any illegal methods used, but appreciated new activists taking part in criticizing Scientology.

[...] Before the series began, Shaughnessy wrote a piece saying that although the Red Sox had beaten the Yankees, the series needed to be won, as {{it was the only way}} the Curse of the Bambino, which he had publicized based on the book of the same title in 1990, would end, and demeaning chants of [...] "1918!"

Another mural showing the gods and goddesses of the Muisca {{is made in the}} Hotel Tequendama, named after preceramic archaeological site and rock shelter Tequendama, in {{the centre of}} Bogotá.
