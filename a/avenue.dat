5|$|After World War II, MD410 was {{extended}} even further east and saw significant improvement on its extant sections. By 1946, MD410 {{was extended}} over Ager Road, Hamilton Street, 38th <b>Avenue,</b> and Jefferson <b>Avenue,</b> roads then designated MD209, {{to a new}} eastern terminus at US 1 in Hyattsville. In addition, the pre-1946 course saw completion of efforts to widen the road to 40 feet. The highway between Connecticut <b>Avenue</b> (then MD193) and Georgia <b>Avenue</b> (US29) was widened in 1946 and 1947. The two segments between Wisconsin <b>Avenue</b> (US 240) and Connecticut <b>Avenue</b> (MD193) and between MD650 in Takoma Park and US1 in Hyattsville were widened in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Also in Brooklyn, the BMT Canarsie Line {{would gain}} an eastern branch to Spring Creek, serving Starrett City (now Spring Creek Towers). The {{mainline}} {{would also be}} lengthened from its southern terminus at Rockaway Parkway to a new terminus in Midwood and Flatlands near the existing Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College IRT station. The reroute would not use the existing segment between New Lots <b>Avenue</b> and Rockaway Parkway. Later plans suggested extending the line as far west as McDonald <b>Avenue</b> near the <b>Avenue</b> I station of the IND Culver Line or possibly to New Utrecht <b>Avenue</b> to the New Utrecht Avenue/62nd Street station, creating crosstown service through central Brooklyn. It was also proposed to relocate the Canarsie Line west of its current right-of-way south of Broadway Junction, along the parallel LIRR Bay Ridge Branch (currently a freight-only branch) or in the median of the proposed Queens Interboro Expressway and Cross Brooklyn Expressway, {{which would have been}} built along both the LIRR branch and Linden Boulevard. The re-alignment would have facilitated both extensions. The current Bushwick <b>Avenue,</b> Broadway Junction and Atlantic <b>Avenue</b> stations would have been consolidated into one station on the Bay Ridge Line, new Sutter <b>Avenue</b> and Livonia <b>Avenue</b> stations would have been built, and the East 105th Street station would be replaced with a station at Rockaway <b>Avenue</b> on the Bay Ridge Line. Additional stations would have been built at Remsen <b>Avenue,</b> Ralph <b>Avenue,</b> Utica <b>Avenue</b> to connect with the Utica <b>Avenue</b> Line, Nostrand <b>Avenue</b> to connect with the Nostrand <b>Avenue</b> Line, <b>Avenue</b> H to connect with the Brighton Line, and McDonald <b>Avenue</b> to connect to the Culver Line before terminating at New Utrecht <b>Avenue.</b>|$|E

5|$|As part of Contract 4 of the Dual Contracts, {{between the}} city and the BRT, a three-track {{elevated}} railway was built above the Culver Line from the Fifth <b>Avenue</b> Elevated southeast and south to Coney Island. At Ninth <b>Avenue,</b> the elevated replacements for the Culver Line and West End Line met, with access from both lines to the Fifth <b>Avenue</b> Elevated and Fourth <b>Avenue</b> Subway to the northwest. At 3:00a.m. on March 16, 1919, the first portion of the new elevated structure opened from Ninth <b>Avenue</b> southeast and south to Kings Highway. Except for the omission of a station at 15th <b>Avenue,</b> all of the station locations from the surface line were preserved as elevated stations. The Culver Line was operated as a branch of the Fifth <b>Avenue</b> Elevated, with a free transfer at Ninth <b>Avenue</b> to the West End Line into the Fourth <b>Avenue</b> Subway. An extension to <b>Avenue</b> X was opened at noon on May 10, 1919. The line, the last of the four to Coney Island, was completed on May 1, 1920, at which time the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) was forced to cut the fare from ten to five cents. This construction tied into the existing lower level of the BMT Brighton Line east of West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium. Some Culver Line (5) trains began using the Fourth <b>Avenue</b> Subway to the Nassau Street Loop in Lower Manhattan when that line opened on May 30, 1931; the Fifth <b>Avenue</b> Elevated was closed on May 31, 1940, in conjunction with the unification of the transit system under city operations. Trolleys continued to use the surface tracks on McDonald <b>Avenue</b> until October 30, 1956.|$|E
25|$|Bus lanes {{also exist}} {{on all of}} the major crosstown streets in Midtown Manhattan. The {{bidirectional}} bus lanes 23rd Street, carrying the M23 SBS and various express routes, stretch across almost {{the entire length of the}} street, with the westbound lane running between 1st and 8th <b>Avenues</b> and the eastbound lane between 10th and 2nd <b>Avenues.</b> On 34th Street, both lanes run between 11th and 1st <b>Avenues,</b> serving the M34 and M34A SBS buses as well as westbound express routes. Eight blocks north, 42nd Street's lanes between Dyer and 3rd <b>Avenues</b> carry mainly the M42. 57th Street's bus lanes between 8th and 2nd <b>Avenues</b> are used by the M31, M57, and various eastbound express routes.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Avenues</b> lie just {{northeast}} of downtown Salt Lake City and just east - over City Creek Canyon - from Capitol Hill. The neighborhood {{to the east}} of the lower (below 11th) <b>Avenues,</b> known as Federal Heights, is traditionally thought of as beginning north of South Temple Street and East of Virginia Street. While physically part of the <b>Avenues,</b> the Federal Heights neighborhood may be considered as generally more affluent than the <b>Avenues,</b> with larger, more stately homes. To the north of Federal Heights is a more recently developed area called Arlington Hills. Compared to the neighborhoods to the east, the <b>Avenues</b> are in places quite steep as they climb the foothills to the north.|$|R

5|$|Baltimore <b>Avenue</b> and Philadelphia <b>Avenue</b> {{date back}} to the {{founding}} of Ocean City in 1875. Both avenues originally extended from South Division Street to North Division Street. The streets were later extended north as far as 15th Street. Baltimore <b>Avenue</b> served as the main thoroughfare of Ocean City until Philadelphia <b>Avenue</b> and Coastal Highway assumed predominance in the 1950s. MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore <b>Avenue,</b> which was paved from US 213 (Worcester Street) to 15th Street by 1927. MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia <b>Avenue</b> when that street was rebuilt between US 213 and 15th Street in 1933. MD 528 was extended north to the Delaware state line when Coastal Highway was completed in 1939.|$|E

50|$|This street {{numbering}} {{system does not}} hold true over a large area. The area served by numbered <b>Avenues</b> runs from about Marble Cliff to South Linden to the Airport, and the area served by numbered Streets covers Downtown and nearby neighborhoods {{to the east and}} south, with only a few exceptions. There are quite few intersections between numbered Streets and <b>Avenues.</b> Furthermore, named Streets and <b>Avenues</b> can have any orientation. For example, while all of the numbered <b>avenues</b> run east-west, perpendicular to High Street, many named, non-numbered <b>avenues</b> run north-south, parallel to High. The same is true of many named streets: while the numbered streets in the city run north-south, perpendicular to Broad Street, many named, non-numbered streets run east-west, perpendicular to High Street.|$|R

[...] The shorter blocks near the Hudson and East River waterfronts was purposeful, as the Commissioners' expected {{that there would be}} more development there at a time when water-based transportation was still significant. The Commission expected that street frontage near the piers would be more valuable than the landlocked interior, the waterfront being the location of commerce and industry of the time, and so it would be to everyone's benefit to place <b>avenues</b> closer together at the island's edges. [...] Although varied, the width of all the <b>avenues</b> were sufficient to accommodate large numbers of horse-drawn mass transportation vehicles such as the omnibus, which would soon appear in Manhattan in the late 1820s, but the precursors to which had been operating in Paris as early as 1662, operated by philosopher Blaise Pascal.|$|R

Kingsland, carrying Route 7, crosses back into Nutley, regaining state maintenance. When Kingsand becomes County Route 644 at the intersection with Cathedral <b>Avenue,</b> Route 7 turns north from Kingsland onto Cathedral <b>Avenue</b> and comes to its terminus at Orange St in Nutley. However, signage continues to indicate Route 7 up to the terminus of Cathedral <b>Avenue</b> at interchange with Route 3 at the intersection of Cathedral <b>Avenue,</b> Passaic <b>Avenue,</b> and Ward <b>Avenue.</b>|$|E
