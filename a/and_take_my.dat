500|$|The Pirates of Penzance (New Year's Eve, 1879) also poked fun at grand opera conventions, {{sense of}} duty, family obligation, the [...] "respectability" [...] of {{civilisation}} and the peerage, and {{the relevance of}} a liberal education. The story also revisits Pinafores theme of unqualified people in positions of authority, {{in the person of}} the [...] "modern Major-General" [...] who has up-to-date knowledge about everything except the military. The Major-General and his many daughters escape from the tender-hearted Pirates of Penzance, who are all orphans, on the false plea that he is an orphan himself. The pirates learn of the deception and re-capture the Major-General, but when it is revealed that the pirates are all peers, the Major-General bids them: [...] "resume your ranks and legislative duties, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> daughters, all of whom are beauties!" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from his vacation, Saadiq started writing and recording The Way I See It, which took four months. In {{an interview for}} Sound on Sound, he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: [...] "The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, and since I have my own studio I was able to perfect it <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> time to make it right. I was able {{to live with it}} day after day, and I think that {{had a lot to do}} with how the album turned out." [...] He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to [...] "the state of the industry" [...] and idealized [...] "bounc ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream. I'd crank records out weekly if I had staff writers like they did at Stax and Motown".|$|E
500|$|Edward {{made his}} final {{appearance}} in public on 1 July, {{when he showed}} himself at his window in Greenwich Palace, horrifying those who saw him by his [...] "thin and wasted" [...] condition. During the next two days, large crowds arrived hoping to see the king again, but on 3 July, {{they were told that}} the weather was too chilly for him to appear. Edward {{died at the age of}} 15 at Greenwich Palace at 8pm on 6 July 1553. According to John Foxe's legendary account of his death, his last words were: [...] "I am faint; Lord have mercy upon me, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> spirit". He was buried in the Henry VII Lady Chapel at Westminster Abbey on 8 August 1553, with reformed rites performed by Thomas Cranmer. The procession was led by [...] "a grett company of chylderyn in ther surples" [...] and watched by Londoners [...] "wepyng and lamenting"; the funeral chariot, draped in cloth of gold, was topped by an effigy of Edward, with crown, sceptre, and garter. Edward's burial place was unmarked until as late as 1966, when an inscribed stone was laid in the chapel floor by Christ's Hospital school to commemorate their founder. The inscription reads as follows: [...] "In Memory Of King Edward VI Buried In This Chapel This Stone Was Placed Here By Christ's Hospital In Thanksgiving For Their Founder 7 October 1966".|$|E

2500|$|Turner {{was picked}} on the New Zealand tour. He {{was going to}} delay his {{departure}} {{to be with his}} wife when their son was born. However Turner changed his mind. He later said [...] "There's always the danger that if I arrive late, somebody will get 100 <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> test position." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite his ordeal, he {{continued}} recording and scored another #1 hit in August 1960 with [...] "Don't You Know"/"Come On <b>And</b> <b>Take</b> <b>My</b> Hand", {{and the next}} single, [...] "Ready For You"/"Save The Last Dance For Me", reached #4 in November. However many believe he never fully recovered from the accident {{and that it was}} the catalyst for his subsequent mental health problems.|$|E
2500|$|In 1861, Williamson {{worked for}} the local theatre company of Messrs. Hurd and Perkins as call-boy, general {{assistant}} and scenery and props maker. [...] There he made his official stage debut. [...] He later recalled: [...] "I used to act in amateur theatricals, and when I was sixteen I got an engagement with a company at the Milwaukee theatre. I was full of energy and enthusiasm, and did pretty well everything. My mornings were spent in learning fencing and dancing. In the afternoon I'd look after the box office, and at evening help the stage manager <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> part â€“ sometimes three or four parts." [...] The next year, he joined the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Toronto, Canada and {{then moved on to}} New York where he found work as a dialect comedian and then played for several years at Wallack's Theatre. [...] From his seven-year apprenticeship there, Williamson emerged with a thorough knowledge of acting, play production and stage management. [...] He then played in a musical comedy at the Theatre Comique in New York under the management of W. H. Lingard. [...] Although Williamson was not a good singer, his talent for comedy carried him.|$|E

60|$|I hesitated--not in the {{interests}} of propriety; only in the interest of her night's rest. She came close to me, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand.|$|R
2500|$|Sonnet 64 is {{very similar}} to Shakespeare's Sonnet 60 where both sonnets focus on a central idolizing of [...] "time as the destroyer". In Helen Vendler's, The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets, Vendler {{describes}} Sonnet 64 to be written in a state of horror and [...] "unprotected vulnerability". The speaker's horror is manifested in the line, Increasing store with loss, and loss with store. Vendler argues that in this line [...] "Loss wins in both cases. It is of course impossible to increase abundance with loss, and equally impossible to increase loss by adding abundance to it." [...] Atkins is also in agreement that sonnet 64 especially in line 12, the speaker expresses a state of fear: That Time will come <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> love away. In [...] "Shakespeare's Sonnets" [...] Atkins argues the meaning of this line is clear that [...] "after seeing all these other ruins, I think about your eventual ruin". Vendler calls line 12 a [...] "collapse into monosyllabic truth", [...] "and its dismayed adolescent simplicity of rhythm, this line feels like a death." [...] Booth claims that in line 13 is unclear: [...] "death, the nearest potential antecedent, cannot choose, but it cannot weep or fear either; thought makes better sense, but it is the thinker who does the weeping and fearing." [...] Vendler argues that in the last three lines of the sonnet a [...] "'natural' pattern of unreversed ruin 'defeats' the intellectual mastery-by-chiasmus, as the concept of gradual leakage comes to represent personal loss. Time takes love away, a thought is like a death, one weeps to have what one fears to lose.... Having while fearing to lose is already a form of losing." [...] Overall, both Booth and Vendler agree in the last three lines of the sonnet the speaker weeps at the fear of losing his love, ultimately realizing that he cannot escape time and time will come and take his love away.|$|E
