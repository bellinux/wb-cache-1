40|$|Abstract—We propose ORCHESTRA, {{a channel}} access pro-tocol that uses {{reservations}} and virtual MIMO to provide high throughput and bounded channel <b>access</b> <b>delays.</b> Channel <b>access</b> process {{is divided into}} a contention-based access period and a scheduled access period. To attain high throughput, nodes build the channel schedule using the contention-based access period, and utilize the spatial multiplexing gain of virtual MIMO links in the scheduled access period. To attain bounded channel <b>access</b> <b>delays,</b> nodes reserve time slots through opportunistic reserva-tions. We evaluate the performance of ORCHESTRA through numerical analysis and simulations, and show that it results in much better throughput, delay, and jitter characteristics than simply using MIMO nodes together with scheduled access (i. e., NAMA) or contention-based access (i. e., IEEE 802. 11 DCF).

30|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the particular communication requirements introduced by traffic safety applications, namely, low-delay, reliable, real-time communications. The requirement on low delay implies {{the need for}} an ad hoc V 2 V network, whereas the reliability constraint poses high demands on the physical layer in terms of adaptive channel coding and modulation. The ad hoc network together with the real-time constraints requires a decentralized predictable MAC method capable of meeting real-time deadlines. We compare two MAC methods: CSMA of 802.11 p and STDMA of AIS in terms of channel <b>access</b> <b>delays</b> by means of simulating a highway scenario. We have selected a data traffic scenario that is typically found in traffic safety applications: time-triggered periodic position messages having deadlines such that they expire when the next updated message arrives.

The model gives the probability distribution function (PDF) of MAC <b>access</b> <b>delay</b> and several relative characteristic numbers, including the mean value, variance, standard deviation and deviation coefficient of MAC <b>access</b> <b>delay.</b> The results of the analytical model coincide with simulations, which validates the model proposed. A lot of analyses are presented. Firstly, the model presents the relationship among number of nodes and sending probability, collision probability, freezing probability and mean delay of all ACs (access categories). Secondly, the model discloses the composition of MAC <b>access</b> <b>delay.</b> Thirdly, the model presents the effect of different values of AIFS (arbitration inter frame spacing) on MAC <b>access</b> <b>delay.</b> Lastly, the model presents that the deviation coefficient of MAC <b>access</b> <b>delay</b> is larger than 1, so when the exponential distribution is adopted as the distribution of MAC <b>access</b> <b>delay,</b> the capacity of the queue system will be evaluated wrongly.
