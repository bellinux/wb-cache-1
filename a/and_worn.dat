5|$|MACN Pv-RN 975, a {{fragment}} of the mandible (lower jaw) preserving one premolar, was discovered in 1991 and tentatively identified as Ferugliotherium by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996, but this assignment remains controversial. The poorly preserved <b>and</b> <b>worn</b> premolar is a bladelike tooth, resembling multituberculate fourth lower premolars (p4). The premolar is 4.8mm long and bears eight faint ridges on both the labial (towards the lips) and lingual (towards the tongue) sides. On the labial side, the four ridges at the back are more widely separated than the four in front of them. The back and front margins of the tooth are parallel {{and there is no}} small cusp on the labial side. There are two roots; the one at the front is larger than the one at the back and bears a furrow. The lower border of the enamel cover is marked by two semicircular extensions of the enamel on the front side, but there is only one such extension at the back. By its size, the number of ridges, and apparently greater length than height, it differs from all known multituberculate first, second, and third lower premolars, indicating that it is a p4.|$|E

5|$|Stoke {{slipped down}} {{the league in}} an {{extremely}} tight 1937–38 season, and, annoyed by rumours circulating the city of resentment {{in the dressing room}} against him for his England success, Matthews requested a transfer in February; his request was denied. His request became public knowledge, and, disturbed by the attention and harassment he was receiving from Stoke supporters urging him to stay, Matthews decided to take a few days off from the club to relax in Blackpool. Finding no peace there either, Stoke chairman Albert Booth told Matthews he {{would not be allowed to}} leave the club, and 3,000 City supporters organized a meeting to make their feelings known – they too demanded that he stay. Touched by their strength of feeling <b>and</b> <b>worn</b> out by the attention he was receiving, Matthews agreed to stay. Despite playing regularly for the national side, Matthews put in 38 games for Stoke in 1938–39, helping them to a seventh-place finish – there would not be another full season of Football League action until 1946.|$|E
5|$|The traditions {{established}} in the medieval period continued later. By {{the middle of the}} 15thcentury, a crown was formally worn on six religious feasts every year: Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, Whitsun, All Saints' Day, and one or both feasts of StEdward. A crown was also displayed <b>and</b> <b>worn</b> at the annual State Opening of Parliament. Around this time, three swords– symbols of kingship since ancient times– were being used in the coronation ceremony to represent the king's powers in the administration of justice: the Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword of Temporal Justice, and the blunt Sword of Mercy. Another emerging item of state regalia was the orb, described in Tudor inventories as a round ball with a cross of gold, which underlined the monarch's sovereignty. Orbs had been pictorial emblems of royal authority in England since the early Middle Ages but a real orb was probably not used at any English coronation until that of HenryVIII in 1509; it would be added to the coronation regalia in the 17thcentury.|$|E

The results demonstrated that: (1) the best competitive material of friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> performance of the 201 HT was the 201 HTC. (2) the 201 HTC modified by carbon following the initial mill for oil storage of the micro-groove to be produced, increased the corresponding lubrication performance reduced the friction coefficient <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> rate effectively. (3) the 201 HT- 201 HTC could obtain both better friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> mainly due to the initial process of grinding following the 201 HT plastic deformation occurred in the surface {{and the formation of}} a series of re-melting welding points, whereas the 201 HT material hardness would be similar to the 201 HTC material hardness, which led into the competitive material friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> performance improvement...|$|R

5|$|Scheer {{immediately}} planned another {{foray into}} the North Sea, but the damage to Seydlitz delayed the operation {{until the end of}} May. The II Battle Squadron—possessing the weakest battleships involved in the battle, and under-strength owing to the absence of , guarding the mouth of the Elbe, <b>and</b> , <b>worn</b> out and removed from active service—was positioned {{at the rear of the}} German line. Shortly before 16:00 the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that resulted the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. Upon realizing that the German fleet was coming into range, Beatty turned his ships back toward the Grand Fleet. Scheer ordered the fleet to pursue the retreating battleships of the British 5th Battle Squadron at top speed. Deutschland and the other pre-dreadnoughts were significantly slower than the dreadnoughts, and quickly fell behind. By 19:30, the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene and confronted Scheer with significant numerical superiority. The German fleet's maneuverability was severely hampered by the presence of the pre-dreadnoughts; if Scheer ordered an immediate turn towards Germany, he would have to sacrifice the slower ships to make good his escape.|$|E
5|$|The club is {{associated}} with two very different colour schemes—white and black (first permanently adopted in 1920), and orange, navy and white (first used in 1973, <b>and</b> <b>worn</b> by the team as of the 2015–16 season). Luton mainly wore a combination of light blue and white before 1920, when white shirts and black shorts were first adopted. These colours were retained for over half a century, with the colour of the socks varying between white and black, until Luton changed to orange, navy and white {{at the start of}} the 1973–74 season. Luton began playing in white shirts, shorts and socks in 1979, with the orange and navy motif reduced to trim; navy shorts were adopted in 1984. This palette was retained until the 1999–2000 season, when the team played in orange shirts and blue shorts. From 2000 to 2008, Luton returned to white shirts and black shorts; orange was included as trim until 2007. The white, navy and orange palette favoured in the 1980s was brought back in 2008, following the results of a club poll, but a year later the colours were changed yet again, this time to a predominantly orange strip with white shorts. Navy shorts were readopted in 2011. Luton are wearing orange shirts, navy shorts and white socks during the 2015–16 season.|$|E
