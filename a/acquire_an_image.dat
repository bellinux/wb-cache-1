50|$|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) {{produces}} a 3-dimensional image {{that allows for}} exceptional evaluation of soft tissue structures, {{as well as the}} detection of boney change and the presence of excessive fluid accumulation associated with inflammation. Like CT, an MRI image may be viewed in various planes of orientation, improving visualization of anatomic structures and any associated pathologic change. MRI is considered the gold standard for diagnosing soft tissue injury within the foot. While it can provide a definitive diagnosis in cases where other imaging modalities have failed, it does have several limitations. Available magnet size restricts imaging {{to the level of the}} stifle or elbow, or below. MRI takes a significant amount of time <b>acquire</b> <b>an</b> <b>image,</b> which translates to long anesthesia times and therefore reduces the size of the area that may be imaged in a single session. The area thought to be associated with lameness must be placed in the MRI. MRI is therefore inappropriate for any lameness that can not be localized to a specific region of the limb. Additionally, MRI has limited availability and high cost compared to the other imaging modalities.|$|E

30|$|One {{interesting}} {{effect is}} the decrease of uncertainty {{between the individual}} atomic columns and atomic planes for the single scanned image and the Smart Align image. For the fast scan atomic column uncertainty {{there is a small}} improvement for the aligned stack (7.5 to 5.9 p.m.), while for the atomic plane uncertainty there is a much larger improvement (5 to 1 p.m.). This is most likely due to the scanning distortions being correlated when <b>acquiring</b> <b>a</b> single scanned <b>image</b> using line synchronization. When <b>acquiring</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> stack with <b>a</b> short pixel dwell time of 2  s, these scanning distortions are much less correlated. Since finding the distances between the atom planes consists of averaging the positions of many atomic columns, these uncorrelated local distortions in the image stack are averaged out.|$|R

40|$|Imaging through {{scattering}} {{materials is}} an important research area that is generally limited to medical diagnostic applications. Published techniques typically use a method of time- or coherence-gating of ballistic photons that separates these early photons in order to <b>acquire</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> without the large background created by the later-arriving diffuse light. Because of {{the limited number of}} ballistic photons and the typically low signal-to-noise ratios of these schemes, a large number of averages or scans is necessary.

Compressive sensing has been used with such an optical setup to reconstruct an image using 1 -minimization. To avoid this type of reconstruction, we consider an adaptive approach leading to a direct restoration of an image and for which we propose a new acquisition strategy. Our technique allows one to <b>acquire</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> in the wavelet domain with a progressive non-linear acquisition strategy. This scheme is based on the non-linear approximation of the wavelet transform which takes advantage of the transformation's sparsity.

The AFM {{is one of the}} types of scanned-proximity probe microscopes (SPMs). The tip used in this study was the RTESP Tap 300 Metrology Probe. SPMs work by measuring a local property, such as height, optical absorption, and magnetism, with a ‘probe’ or ‘tip’ placed very close to the sample. The small probe-sample separation (on the order of the instrument's resolution) makes it possible to take measurements over a small area. To <b>acquire</b> <b>an</b> <b>image,</b> the microscope raster scans the probe over the sample while measuring the local property in question.

40|$|Abstract — Giving {{the ability}} to read {{characters}} and symbols is highly desirable for increased autonomy of mobile robots operating in the real world. The idea is fairly simple: give a robot {{the ability to}} <b>acquire</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of a message to read, extract the symbols and recognize them. Image character recognition research {{has been going on for}} decades now, with good results. But compared to conventional character recognition systems, the challenge with a mobile robot is to find a textual message to capture in the world and to get a good view of the message, knowing that the viewpoint of the robot depends on its position in relation to the message, which cannot be pre-specified. In this paper we present our approach making it possible for an autonomous mobile robot to read messages. We outline the constraints under which the approach works, and present results obtained using a Pioneer 2 robot equipped with a Pentium 233 MHz and a pan-tilt-zoom camera. I...|$|E
40|$|Digital image {{forensics}} {{seeks to}} detect statistical traces left by image acquisition or post-processing {{in order to}} establish an images source and authenticity. Digital cameras <b>acquire</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> with one sensor overlayed with a color filter array (CFA), capturing at each spatial location one sample from the three necessary color channels. The missing pixels must be interpolated in a process known as demosaicking. This process is highly nonlinear and can vary greatly between different camera brands and models. Most practical algorithms, however, introduce correlations between the color channels, which are often different between algorithms. In this paper, we show how these correlations can be used to construct a characteristic map that is useful in matching an image to its source. Results show that our method employing inter-channel traces can distinguish between sophisticated demosaicking algorithms. It can complement existing classifiers based on inter-pixel correlations by providing a new feature dimension. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E
