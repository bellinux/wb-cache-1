50|$|A Zungenbecken, {{also called}} a tongue basin or tongue-basin, {{is part of}} a {{succession}} of ice <b>age</b> <b>geological</b> landforms, known as a glacial series. It is a hollow that is left behind by the ice mass, as the snout of the glacier (German: Gletscherzunge) recedes, which initially fills with meltwater, forming a proglacial lake, and later may be filled with surface water from streams or precipitation. When the glacier has more fully retreated this produces a finger lake or glacial piedmont lake (German: Zungenbeckensee, known as a Gletscherendsee of the glacial series in the Alpine Foreland). The term Zungenbecken is of German origin, but used in English language sources.|$|E

40|$|The "Celica-Lancones" forearc Basin of Southern Ecuador and Northern Peru {{is located}} between the Paleozoic Amotape-Tahuin Massif {{to the west}} and NW and the {{continental}} volcanic arc to the east and SE. The study of nine sections and exhaustive sampling of the poorly fossiliferous, mainly clastic Cretaceous deposits of the Basin allowed us to define five distinct series, which display two depositional periods. The first period corresponds to the development of an Early(?) and Middle Albian carbonate shelf, interrupted during Late Albian times by the creation of a tectonically generated trough filled by turbidites of Late Albian-Coniacian <b>age.</b> <b>Geological</b> mapping indicates that this "Celica-Lancones Basin s. s. " includes distinct tectonic units, characterized by distinct early Late Cretaceous stratigraphic series and separated by major faults. These units can be grouped into two main paleogeographic domains. The southeastern one comprises mainly volcaniclastic deposits, whereas the northwestern domain exhibits quartz-rich deposits. Between Early Coniacian and Middle Campanian times, the "Celica-Lancones Basin s. s" forearc trough was deformed and eroded {{as a result of the}} Late Cretaceous "Peruvian" tectonic phase. The second period corresponds to the latest Cretaceous, during which a new forearc basin was created (Paita-Yunguilla Basin), which is much wider and strikes obliquely with respect to the Celica-Lancones Basin. The sediments of the Paita-Yunguilla Basin exhibit a comparable succession of Campanian-Maastrichtian age throughout the area and conceal the tectonic juxtaposition of the early Late Cretaceous tectonic units. The occurrence of thick Early(?) Maastrichtian coarse-grained conglomerates and breccias express a new significant tectonic event. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|The lithology, <b>age,</b> <b>geological</b> setting, {{structural}} and metamorphic {{history of the}} granitic mylonites from the Mylonite Zone (MZ) in southwestern Sweden have been studied extensively. The deformation history, growth of microstructures, intensity of deformation, changes in mineral compositions, and pressure-temperature conditions of deformation have, however, not been addressed. In this study, powder X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, electron microprobe analysis and transmission electron microscopy of micas, chlorite, and plagioclase are combined to understand the physical and textural changes experienced by the rocks during mylonitization. It is shown that the occurrence of foliated micas in shear bands, recrystallization of quartz and biotite, and undulatory extinction in quartz grains were not uniform throughout the samples studied. Occurrence of dislocations and low-angle grain boundaries confirm that deformation occurred largely by glide dislocations. The low-angle grain boundaries observed are formed by the re-arrangement of these dislocations during grain size reduction processes. The micas show {{a high degree of}} spatial stacking order, but spatial stacking disorder in micas and chlorites has also been found. Ordered stacking faults are formed during low strain while disordered stacking faults are formed under high strain conditions. Occurrence of both ordered and disordered stacking faults indicates that the intensity of deformation was not uniform through the entire MZ. Moreover, the chemical composition of plagioclase shows that the exsolution lamellae observed with optical and electron microscopy are due to Ca-subsolidus reactions during low temperature deformation. Several substitution reactions occurring in the micas indicate that deformation took place between 0. 3 and 0. 4 GPa, at a temperature higher than 500 degreesC...|$|E
40|$|A Late Miocene-Early Pleistocene mixed carbonate-siliciclastic {{sedimentary}} succession about 2 500 m {{thick in}} the Hawke’s Bay forearc basin {{is the focus}} of a basin analysis. The area under investigation covers 3 500 km 2 of western and central Hawke’s Bay. The stratigraphy of Hawke’s Bay Basin is characterised by dramatic vertical and lateral facies changes and significant fluxes of siliciclastic sediment through the Late Miocene and Pliocene. This project aims to better understand the character and origin of the sedimentary succession in the basin. Geological mapping has been undertaken at a scale of 1 : 25000, with data managed in an ARCINFO geodatabase, following the database model employed in the IGNS QMap programme. Along the western margin of the basin there is progressive southward onlap of late Cenozoic strata on to basement. The oldest units are of Late Miocene (Tongaporutuan) age and the youngest onlap units are of latest Pliocene (Nukumaruan) <b>age.</b> <b>Geological</b> mapping of the basin fill places constraints on the magnitude (about 10 km) and timing (Pleistocene) of most of the offset on the North Island Shear Belt. Lithofacies have been described and interpreted representing fluvial, estuarine, shoreface and inner- to outer-shelf environments. Conglomerate facies are representative of sediment-saturated prograding fluvial braidplains and river deltas. These units are dominated by greywacke gravels and record the erosion of the Kaweka-Ahimanawa Ranges. Sandstone facies typically comprise very well sorted, clean non-cemented units of 10 - 50 m thickness that accumulated in innershelf environments. Siltstone facies probably accumulated in relatively quiet, middle- to outer-shelf water depths, and comprise well-sorted, firm non-cemented units with occasional tephra interbeds. Limestone facies represent examples of continent-attached cool-water carbonate systems that developed in response to strong tidal currents and a high nutrient flux during the Pliocene. These facies are examples of mixed siliciclastic-bioclastic sedimentary systems. Of these facies the widespread distribution and thickness of sandstone and limestone units present the most potential for hydrocarbon reservoirs. Similarly, the distribution of siltstone and mudstone beds provides adequate seal rocks. Mangapanian limestone facies have already been targeted as potential petroleum reservoirs (e. g. Kereru- 1). Geological mapping suggests that potential hydrocarbon reservoir and seal rocks occur extensively in the subsurface...|$|E

40|$|Whollydooleya tomnpatrichorum gen. et sp. nov. is a new, highly {{specialised}} hypercarnivorous dasyuromorphian {{from a new}} mid-Cenozoic limestone deposit {{southwest of}} the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in northwestern Queensland. Dental dimensions suggest it may have weighed {{at least twice as}} much as the living Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii). Although known only from a lower molar, it exhibits a plethora of carnivorous adaptations including a hypertrophied protoconid, tiny metaconid and a battery of vertical carnassial blades between most of the major cusps, most of which incorporate carnassial notches to immobilise materials being sheared. It is unique among dasyuromorphians in having a massive entoconid that closes the entire lingual side of the talonid. Comparison with previously known thylacinid and dasyurid hypercarnivores suggests its relationships are closer to dasyurids than thylacinids in the main because of the very large entoconid, a cusp that is relatively small to absent in all known thylacinids but commonly small to large in dasyurids. However, the extent of enlargement of the entoconid suggests that it is not closely related to previously known Cenozoic hypercarnivorous dasyurids in the genera Dasyurus, Glaucodon, Sarcophilus {{or any of the other}} previously described Cenozoic dasyurids. Although the early late Miocene Ganbulanyi djadjinguli is only known from an upper molar, the reduced area of its protocone suggests a correspondingly reduced rather than hypertrophied entoconid in its as-yet-unknown lower molars. Reconsideration of the structure of the talonid in species of Sarcophilus even suggests that within that Quaternary lineage, the entoconid may have been entirely lost, with the posteriorly displaced metaconid taking its functional place as an occlusal counterpart for the blades of the protocone. The large size of the new species signals the earliest indication within the dasyurid radiation of a late Cenozoic trend towards gigantism that became evident in many lineages of Australian marsupials. While the age is uncertain, on the basis of associated taxa such as species of Ekaltadeta, it is probably either mid or late Miocene in <b>age.</b> <b>Geological</b> features of the deposit suggest it was formed within a pool in a cave environment that periodically underwent desiccation. Some grains suggest an aeolian as well as an alluvial and pluvial origin for the deposit. This may relate to current understanding about environmental change that took place in the region following the mid Miocene climate oscillation...|$|E
40|$|Integrated archaeological and {{geological}} {{studies conducted}} on Mistras coastal barrier system of central Sardinia {{showed that it}} developed as transgressive systems during {{the final stages of}} the Holocene sea level rise (final stage of the Holocene Climate Optimum, about 6300 – 6000 cal y BP), and become regressive (prograding) from about 2500 cal y BP, when sea level reached the present elevation. The regression of the coast was, however, not continuous, but characterized by distinct Transgressive-Regressive phases (T-R), associated to precise climatic fluctuations, tied with global eustatic and climatic phases. The first regression occurred between 2500 and 1900 cal y BP. This time interval, known as Roman Warm, coincides with the Phoenician, Punic and Roman attendance of the west Sardinia coast. At that time, areas close to the coastal cities had to host landings and perhaps ports probably located at short distance from the shoreline. Archaeological excavations and findings have documented that in the Mistras area Punic constructed a long boulder structure (probably dated from the 4 th century BCE) to better protect an incipient lagoon used as the harbour of the city of Tharros. This had the effect to modify the normal behaviour of the beach system that transformed from spit to barrier lagoon. During the second regressive phase, the well-established beach lagoon system developed quasi continuously for > 1200 y (650 and 1850 CE). This progradation started during a new warm period (Medieval) and continued favoured by gentle sea level fall occurred during the cold Little Ice Age time. During this time, after the abandonment of the city of Tharros and of the Sinis Peninsula, the Mistras area was poorly populated. As consequence, there was no more an active harbour and large sandy dunes developed and nourished the shore allowing a no man-influence progradation of the coast. The third stage is the current one and begun about 165 y ago (post 1850 CE) after the relative sea level rise occurred {{after the end of the}} Little Ice <b>Age.</b> <b>Geological</b> and archaeological data of western Sardinia barrier lagoon systems revealed that the Mistras barrier lagoon evolution was human influenced since the Punic time. The study pointed that little human activities on the coast could influence its natural behaviour and landscape, and that little climatic changes both positive and negative can induce progradation or erosion of the system as well...|$|E
