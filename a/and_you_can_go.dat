500|$|Lynch {{described}} {{the attractiveness of}} the idea of a pilot, despite the knowledge that the medium of television would be constricting: [...] "I'm a sucker for a continuing story... Theoretically, you can get a very deep story <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> so deep and open the world so beautifully, but it takes time to do that." [...] The story included normal and surreal elements, much like Lynch's earlier series Twin Peaks. Groundwork was laid for story arcs, such as the mystery of Rita's identity, Betty's career and Adam Kesher's film project.|$|E

2500|$|Spirits dead wheel {{turned out}} to be a mixed blessing. As it was {{traveling}} in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist Steve Squyres. [...] "We're really excited about this," [...] he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in silica–the main ingredient of window glass. The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks [...] stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. [...] "The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same," [...] Squyres explained to BBC News. Hot water provides an environment in which microbes can thrive and the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them. Squyres added, [...] "You can go to hot springs <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> to fumaroles and at either place on Earth it is teeming with life – microbial life." ...|$|E
