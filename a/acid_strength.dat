25|$|The {{sulfuric acid}} {{present in the}} {{reaction}} zone serves as a catalyst to the alkylation reaction. Theoretically, a catalyst promotes a chemical reaction without being changed {{as a result of}} that reaction. In reality, however, the acid is diluted as a result of the side reactions and feed contaminants. To maintain the desired spent <b>acid</b> <b>strength,</b> a small amount of fresh acid is continuously charged to the acid recycle line from the acid settler to the reactor and an equivalent amount of spent acid is withdrawn from the acid settler. In the fractionation section the unreacted isobutane is recovered for recycle to the reaction section and remaining hydrocarbons are separated into the desired products.|$|E
25|$|Nitric acid, after {{distillation}} {{to increase}} the <b>acid</b> <b>strength,</b> is capable of dissolving the silver {{but it will not}} (by itself) dissolve the gold. However, nitric acid is not able to (fully) extract silver and other impurities from an alloy with a high content of gold. Therefore, one part of scrap gold was typically alloyed with three parts of copper (quartering) before parting with nitric acid. Another method uses Sterling silver instead of copper. One part pure gold is alloyed with three parts Sterling silver (inquarting). The resulting six karat (6K) gold can then be parted with dilute nitric acid (one part 68-70% nitric acid to one part DISTILLED water). With the karat gold this low (6K), and over medium high heat, the dilute nitric acid will dissolve the Sterling silver (and other base metals in the karat gold) starting on the outside surface of the 6K gold alloy, working its way into the gold alloy, forming a honeycomb structure as it works its way into the metals. Since nitric acid will not dissolve gold, nearly pure gold (very close to 99.5% pure) will be left behind after the reaction is complete. After removing the solid gold other elements like silver and copper may be extracted from the liquid. To get the gold to a very high level of purity (999 fine gold) it is sometimes processed further with aqua regia to effectively remove all the impurities.|$|E

2500|$|The {{other way}} to measure <b>acid</b> <b>strength</b> {{is to look at}} its {{fractional}} dissociation, which is symbolized as α (alpha) and which can range from 0% < α < 100%. The dissociation ratio is defined as ...|$|E
2500|$|Oxalic acid is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C2H2O4. It is a colorless crystalline solid that forms a colorless solution in water. Its condensed formula is HOOCCOOH, reflecting its classification as the simplest dicarboxylic acid. Its <b>acid</b> <b>strength</b> {{is much greater}} than that of acetic acid. Oxalic acid is a reducing agent [...] and its conjugate base, known as oxalate (...) , is a chelating agent for metal cations. Typically, oxalic acid occurs as the dihydrate with the formula C2H2O4·2H2O. Excessive ingestion of oxalic acid or prolonged skin contact can be dangerous.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>strength</b> is {{commonly}} measured by two methods. One measurement, {{based on the}} Arrhenius definition of acidity, is pH, which is a measurement of the hydronium ion concentration in a solution, as expressed on a negative logarithmic scale. Thus, solutions that have a low pH have a high hydronium ion concentration, and {{can be said to}} be more acidic. The other measurement, based on the Brønsted–Lowry definition, is the acid dissociation constant (Ka), which measures the relative ability of a substance to act as an acid under the Brønsted–Lowry definition of an acid. [...] That is, substances with a higher Ka are more likely to donate hydrogen ions in chemical reactions than those with lower Ka values.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{sulfonated}} poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) ion-exchange resins with {{varying levels of}} sulfonation has been prepared. The acidities of these resins in the hydrated form have been characterised microcalorimetrically by titration with aqueous NaOH solution. The resultant molar enthalpies of neutralisation have been compared with <b>acid</b> <b>strengths</b> of the same resins measured {{in the absence of}} water by ammonia adsorption microcalorimetry, and catalytic activities in two test reactions, the dehydration of 1 -hexanol and the hydration of propene. The molar enthalpies of neutralisation of hydrated resins with aqueous NaOH have been shown to increase with increasing sulfonation level. This has been explained in terms of an increasing concentration of sulfonic acid in the internal gel solution, generating stronger acid sites and higher specific catalytic activities. A similar trend of increasing <b>acid</b> <b>strengths</b> has been observed in anhydrous resins, but this has been explained in terms of structural features such as di-substitution of sulfonic acid groups on styrene units, giving rise to intrinsically stronger acid sites...|$|R
25|$|Stronger acids have {{a larger}} acid {{dissociation}} constant (Ka) and a smaller logarithmic constant (pKa=logKa) than weaker acids. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+. Two key {{factors that contribute to}} the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. <b>Acid</b> <b>strengths</b> also depend on the stability of the conjugate base.|$|R
40|$|The {{characterization}} of the acidity of zeolites allows a direct correlation with their catalytic activity. To this end, probe molecules are utilized to obtain a ranking of <b>acid</b> <b>strengths.</b> Trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO) is a widely used probe molecule, which allows the sensing of solid acids by using 31 P NMR. We have performed calculations based on the density functional theory to investigate the Brønsted acid (BA) sites in zeolite MFI by adsorbing TMPO as a probe molecule. We have considered the substitution of silicon at the T 2 site by aluminum, both at the internal cavity and at the external surface. The different <b>acid</b> <b>strengths</b> observed in the zeolite MFI when probed by TMPO (very strong, strong, and weak) may depend on the basicity of the centers sharing the acid proton. If the proton lies between the TMPO {{and one of the}} framework oxygen atoms binding the Al, the acidity is strong. When the framework oxygen atom is not directly binding the Al, it is less basic and a shortening of the TMPO–H distance is observed, causing an acid response of very strong. Finally, if two TMPO molecules share the proton, the TMPO–H distance elongates, rendering a weak acid character...|$|R
2500|$|High acid {{concentration}} {{must be maintained}} {{in order to minimize}} polymerization and red oil production. When concentrations is too low catalyst activity is substantially decreased and polymerization enhanced {{to the point that it}} is [...] difficult to maintain <b>acid</b> <b>strength.</b> This condition is known as acid runaway. In SAAU recent studies have found that both butylenes and amylenes can be spent to a lower {{acid concentration}} without entering into a runaway condition. While the economics of alkylating both butylenes and amylenes will benefit from lowering the acid spending strength, the acid consumption of amylenes has a greater response than that of butylenes. Also the expected decrease in octane of alkylates produced at lower acid concentrations is less for amylenes than butylenes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} {{electronegative}} atoms adjacent to an acidic bond also affects <b>acid</b> <b>strength.</b> Oxoacids have the general formula HOX, where X {{can be any}} atom and {{may or may not}} share bonds to other atoms. Increasing the number of electronegative atoms or groups on atom X decreases the electron density in the acidic bond, making the loss of the proton easier. Perchloric acid is a very strong acid (pKa ≈ -8) and completely dissociates in water. Its chemical formula is HClO4 and it comprises a central chlorine atom with three chlorine-oxygen double bonds (Cl=O) and one chlorine-oxygen single bond (Cl—O). The singly bonded oxygen bears an extremely acidic hydrogen atom, which is easily abstracted. In contrast, chloric acid (HClO3) is a weaker acid, though still quite strong (pKa = -1.0), while chlorous acid (HClO2, pKa = +2.0) and hypochlorous acid (HClO, pKa = +7.53) acids are weak acids. values for HClOn from ...|$|E
