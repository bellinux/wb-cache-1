25|$|Metals, and {{specifically}} rare-earth elements (RE), form numerous chemical complexes with boron. Their crystal structure and chemical bonding depend strongly {{on the metal}} element M and on its <b>atomic</b> <b>ratio</b> to boron. When B/M ratio exceeds 12, boron atoms form B12 icosahedra which are linked into a three-dimensional boron framework, and the metal atoms reside in the voids of this framework. Those icosahedra are basic structural units of most allotropes of boron and boron-rich rare-earth borides. In such borides, metal atoms donate electrons to the boron polyhedra, and thus these compounds are regarded as electron-deficient solids.|$|E
25|$|Compounds {{that were}} {{historically}} given the formulae REAlB14 and REB25 have the MgAlB14 structure with an orthorhombic symmetry and space group Imma (No. 74). In this structure, rare-earth atoms enter the Mg site. Aluminium sites are empty for REB25. Both metal sites of REAlB14 structure have partial occupancies of about 60–70%, {{which shows that}} the compounds are actually non-stoichiometric. The REB25 formula merely reflects the average <b>atomic</b> <b>ratio</b> / = 25. Yttrium borides form both YAlB14 and YB25 structures. Experiments have confirmed that the borides based on rare-earth elements from Tb to Lu can have the REAlB14 structure. A subset of these borides, which contains rare-earth elements from Gd to Er, can also crystallize in the REB25 structure.|$|E
25|$|In metal borides, {{the bonding}} of boron varies {{depending}} on the <b>atomic</b> <b>ratio</b> B/M. Diborides have B/M = 2, as in the well-known superconductor MgB2; they crystallize in a hexagonal AlB2-type layered structure. Hexaborides have B/M = 6 and form a three-dimensional boron framework based on a boron octahedron (Fig. 1a). Tetraborides, i.e. B/M = 4, are mixtures of diboride and hexaboride structures. Cuboctahedron (Fig. 1b) is the structural unit of dodecaborides, which have a cubic lattice and B/M = 12. When the composition ratio exceeds 12, boron forms B12 icosahedra (Fig. 1c) which are linked into a three-dimensional boron framework, and the metal atoms reside in the voids of this framework.|$|E

40|$|A {{possible}} {{mechanism of}} strain accommodation in large deformation of glasses is crystallization; deformation stability {{is a measure}} of the resistance of glasses to crystallization. We study the effect of <b>atomic</b> size <b>ratio</b> and <b>atomic</b> stiffness parameter (related to the curvature of the interatomic potential) on deformation stability of binary glasses using molecular static simulations. The deformation stability of a glass is found to increase with increasing <b>atomic</b> size <b>ratio</b> and magnitude of the atomic stiffness, which is proportional to the bulk modulus of the pure crystalline system, as well as the <b>ratio</b> of <b>atomic</b> stiffnesses of constituent atoms. To understand the role of the above parameters on deformation stability, misfit energies of randomly substituted solid solution fcc crystals and glasses are compared for various <b>atomic</b> size <b>ratios</b> and <b>atomic</b> stiffness values. Unlike in fcc solid solution, the misfit energy of binary glasses is found to be insensitive to the <b>atomic</b> size <b>ratio.</b> It is also found that the packing fraction of glasses is insensitive to the <b>atomic</b> size <b>ratio,</b> consistent with the above result. Beyond a critical <b>atomic</b> size <b>ratio,</b> the misfit energy of fcc solid solution exceeds the energy of the glass, thus making the amorphous state completely stable to deformation induced crystallization. Our analysis shows that critical <b>atomic</b> size <b>ratio</b> decreases with increasing atomic stiffness which leads to an increase in the deformation stability of glasses...|$|R
