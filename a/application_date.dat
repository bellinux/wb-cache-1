50|$|Nu Rho Psi, the National Honor Society in Neuroscience, {{was founded}} in 2006, but its history {{can be traced to}} the early 1990s with the {{founding}} of the Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience (FUN). In its formative years, Nu Rho Psi was governed by the FUN Council but, as the Society grew, FUN decided that Nu Rho Psi would be better served by its own separate Council. In 2006 Nu Rho Psi became an independent tax exempt 501(c)(3) public charity incorporated in the state of Ohio, USA. The first Nu Rho Psi National Council was elected in 2011. The first charters were awarded in 2006 to Baldwin Wallace University (<b>application</b> <b>dated</b> 16 Jun 2006), Baylor University (<b>application</b> <b>dated</b> 6 Nov 2006) and Macalester College (<b>application</b> <b>dated</b> 8 Dec 2006).

25|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} calculating creditable continuous coverage {{is available to}} the health plan under Title I. That is, 5 categories of health coverage can be considered separately, including dental and vision coverage. Anything not under those 5 categories must use the general calculation (e.g., the beneficiary may be counted with 18 months of general coverage, but only 6 months of dental coverage, because the beneficiary {{did not have a}} general health plan that covered dental until 6 months prior to the <b>application</b> <b>date).</b> Since limited-coverage plans are exempt from HIPAA requirements, the odd case exists in which the applicant to a general group health plan cannot obtain certificates of creditable continuous coverage for independent limited-scope plans such as dental to apply towards exclusion periods of the new plan that does include those coverages.|$|E
25|$|Boulton's Letter's Patent {{specifications}} were {{sealed on}} 4 August 1868 and the complete patent was backdated to its <b>application</b> <b>date</b> of 5 February 1868. His British patent, the 392nd one completed in 1868, was issued more than 35 years before ailerons were 'reinvented' in France, and ailerons were later repatented in the United States by Glenn Curtiss of the Aerial Experiment Association in about 1911. Boulton's 1868 patent became forgotten and lost from sight until the same time, {{a few years}} before they came into general use in 1915. Aviation historian C. H. Gibbs-Smith acknowledged Boulton's priority of invention, stating that if the 1868 patent had been revealed {{at the time of the}} Wright brothers' legal filings, they might not have been able to claim the priority of invention for the lateral control of flying machines.|$|E
