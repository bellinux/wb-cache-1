Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 46 - 47). Railway system {{is one of the}} most popular and convenient system of transportation in Bangladesh. This whole sector is run by government of the people’s republic of Bangladesh. It {{is one of the most}} popular because it’s fast, traffic less and low cost. Though it is a popular system in Bangladesh, the whole railway system is still <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> orthodox <b>here.</b> The government of Bangladesh faces a huge amount of losses every year because of the lack of efficient and educated manpower and different accidents. A smart automated railway system can solve all these problems. In this paper, a smart automated railway track switching system has been introduced and idea of a smart railway station has been introduced which will reduce the manpower problem and will save a huge amount of public property. This automated system is the combination and synchronization of different standalone subsystems. The introduced first subsystem here is the monitoring of the train via smart satellite navigation system (GPS); the second subsystem is in the control box of the rail track which consists of modern communication system (GSM/GPRS) and control unit for switching the track by filtering the data from the GPS Location. The third subsystem is a monitoring system designed for the control room of the railway station to monitor and control the whole system. The automation and control of the whole system has been done by microcontroller unit to reduce the cost and complexity of the system and for increasing the efficiency. Md. Mohaiminul Islam KhanB.

Jon and Criss continued their musical exploits and played a block party, playing Kiss, Deep Purple and ZZ Top covers.

5000|$|The {{album is}} {{routinely}} {{cited as a}} landmark album {{in the history of}} black metal, and as one of the earliest examples of a band blending black metal and death metal. In his review of the album for AllMusic, William York described all of the album's songs as [...] "expertly crafted mini-epics." [...] He wrote that [...] "There is a strong sense of thematic unity tying each song's various riffs and sections together, and the soaring, darkly majestic guitar melodies are consistently memorable. Sure, there is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of melodrama <b>here,</b> but Dissection is most certainly on top of their game, and Storm of the Light's Bane is deservedly hailed as a landmark in the melodic black/death metal genre." [...] Sputnikmusic wrote that [...] "Storm of the Light’s Bane strives mainly for balance, and manages to easily succeed in this goal due to the sheer amount of attention to detail. The meticulous structure of each song gives the album a refined and almost polished feel, even with the fuzzy production values. While it’s a damn shame that Dissection weren’t able to create more material in their time together, Storm of the Light’s Bane will forever be the legacy that Nödtveidt and company leave behind." [...] Metal Hammer named it one of the 20 best black metal albums of the 90s, noting the influence of melodic death metal, and describing it as [...] "a melodic, majestic and gloriously epic listen that features a measured, bombastic tone yet also makes use of furious, high-paced delivery when necessary." [...] IGN included Storm of the Light's Bane in their [...] "10 Great Black Metal Albums" [...] list. Terrorizer named it the 8th best black metal album of all time, as well as one of the 100 'Most Important Albums of the Nineties'. This is a classic album in its genre." [...] Loudwire describe it as a [...] "milestone in extreme metal" [...] and [...] "one to chill the bones and the only one of its kind." ...|$|R
