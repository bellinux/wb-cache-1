5|$|In 1946, France {{attempted}} to reassert control over its colony and conventional military fighting broke out. Thảo {{served with the}} Vietminh in the Mekong Delta in the far south of Vietnam during the war against French rule from 1946–54. He almost met his end before he had started; he was apprehended by the local communists in Mỹ Tho, who saw his French-style dress and mistook him for a colonial agent. They tied him up and chained him to a block of stone before throwing him into a river to drown. However, Thảo broke free of the weight and swam to safety. Thảo proceeded further south <b>and</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> the Mekong Delta {{to the town of}} Vĩnh Long, where he was again arrested by the local Vietminh. Just as Thảo was about to be executed by drowning, one of the communists realised he was a brother of one of their comrades. Thảo was released and rejoined his family, who lived in the region.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal {{stood with}} his men in the weak center and held them to a {{controlled}} retreat. The crescent of Hispanic and Gallic troops buckled inwards as they gradually withdrew. Knowing {{the superiority of the}} Roman infantry, Hannibal had instructed his infantry to withdraw deliberately, creating an even tighter semicircle around the attacking Roman forces. By doing so, he had turned the strength of the Roman infantry into a weakness. While the front ranks were gradually advancing, the bulk of the Roman troops began to lose their cohesion, as they began crowding themselves into the growing gap. Soon they were compacted together so closely that they had little space to wield their weapons. In pressing so far forward in their desire to destroy the retreating and seemingly collapsing line of Hispanic and Gallic troops, the Romans had ignored (possibly due to the dust) the African troops that stood uncommitted on the projecting ends of this now-reversed crescent. This also gave the Carthaginian cavalry time to drive the Roman cavalry off on both flanks and attack the Roman center in the rear. The Roman infantry, now stripped of protection on both its flanks, formed a wedge that drove deeper <b>and</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> the Carthaginian semicircle, driving itself into an alley formed by the African infantry on the wings. At this decisive point, Hannibal ordered his African infantry to turn inwards and advance against the Roman flanks, creating an encirclement in one of the earliest known examples of a pincer movement.|$|E

500|$|The Army of the Rhine and Moselle {{experienced}} excruciating command {{problems in}} its early operations, and these were especially problematic in campaign failures of 1795. In 1796, the jealousies between commanders complicated the efficient operations of the Army. After a summer of maneuver in which the Coalition force drew the French deeper <b>and</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> German territory, [...] Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen, the Habsburg commander, drubbed the French at Wurzburg and second Wetzlar and then defeated Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's army at the Limburg-Altenkirchen, destroying any chance that Jourdan's force and Moreau's Army of the Rhine and Moselle could merge. Once Jourdan was eliminated from support and withdrew {{to the west bank}} of the Rhine, Charles could focus his attention on Moreau. By October, they were fighting on the western slope of the Black Forest and by December, Charles had the French forces under siege at the principal river crossings of Kehl and Hüningen. By early 1797, the French had relinquished control of the bridgeheads over the Rhine.|$|E
500|$|After her miscarriage, much of {{the hostility}} from the family evaporates, with the {{exception}} of J.R. He openly despises her and her brother. In 1979, Pam is told by Digger's doctor that Digger was a carrier of neurofibromatosis, and that she and Cliff, as his children, were carriers; as neurofibromatosis is a potentially fatal disease to infants. Ironically, Pam soon discovers she is pregnant again. As before, however, tragedy strikes as a rattlesnake frightens Pam's horse when she is out riding and throws her, causing a second miscarriage. [...] In 1980, Pam watches Digger die slowly and painfully {{as a result of his}} decades of heavy drinking. On Digger's deathbed, he tells Pam that she's not his biological child, but born after an affair her mother had with Hutch McKinney. Overwhelmed by a sense of loss after Digger's death and deathbed confession, she pushes to find out more about what happened to her mother. She develops a notion – a dream born out of grief – that perhaps her mother isn't dead after all. Then a private investigator turns up evidence that her mother had not died as Digger had believed, but was alive in Houston. Meanwhile, Bobby has taken over Ewing Oil while J.R. is convalescing after being shot. Pam watches her husband get deeper <b>and</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> the heart of business in an effort to prove himself, and takes note of Bobby's instinctive attraction to power, which she realizes might be a danger to their marriage.|$|E
500|$|Esther is {{introduced}} in press materials as being [...] "an innocent {{in a world}} of assassins, liars and zealots". Havins describes Drummond as [...] "an optimist and the glass is half full person". A promotional video released by Starz provided background information on Esther including her college education—the character introduces herself by stating that she has a BA in Linguistics and a Masters in Cognitive science. Series four writer Jane Espenson enjoyed writing for Esther as she felt the character to be most similar to herself. She notes that when devising Esther's backstory the writer's [...] "ended up just putting my college experience down." [...] Esther's introduction invites parallels that of lead female character Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) in the series' 2006 premiere episode [...] "Everything Changes"; she represents an audience surrogate for new American viewers. Havins refers to Esther as the [...] "tour guide" [...] for new viewers coming to Torchwood for the first time, one who is [...] "digging deeper <b>and</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> the rabbit hole". Despite similarities to their introduction, Havins comments that Esther as a character has a less action-orientated role than Gwen, being more the [...] "techie" [...] of the team who uses her intellect and technology as her weapons. The actress feels that Esther's desk-bound analyst position is [...] "her safe little world". Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies described Esther as [...] "a very healing force" [...] in helping the other more outspoken characters gel together as a team because she is [...] "much more able to empathise with people." [...] The character's sister, Sarah Drummond (Candace Brown), recurs throughout Miracle Day, Havins feels that her presence helps [...] "humanise the situation" [...] as including family members helps the audience [...] "understand why people react a certain way." [...] Espenson notes that the first scene between Esther and Sarah was discussed at length at the writer's room—the writers chose to make Esther's choice whether or not to refer her ill sister to social services [...] "as difficult as possible" [...] to heighten the pain felt by the character.|$|E
