40|$|Abstract – Using Printed Circuit Board (PCB) in the {{electronics}} instrumentation is common. In the experiment phase, not the final phase, {{one has to}} drill the hole and via by himself. The number of holes and vias in the PCB influence the speed of drilling time if it is done manually. The idea is to implement an <b>automatic</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> The system consists of two main parts, i. e. software in PC and the drilling machine itself. The coordinates for holes and vias were generated by PCB drawing software as text file. PC will extract and then send them to the machine via RS- 232 connection. The drilling machine is equipped with MCS- 51 family minimum system. This controls the mechanism of the drilling machine. To move the drill to the specific location, two stepper motor are used. This makes the control system in open loop. From the experiments, X- and Y-axes have different error, i. e. 2. 34 % and 4. 34 % respectively. This {{is due to the}} bending in worm system connected between the motor and the mechanics. For 90 holes (9 x 10) with 100 mils distance, the average time is around 5 minute...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new in-situ technique for characterizing rock mass mechanical {{strength and the}} associated spatial distribution in the ground. The technique involves <b>automatic</b> <b>drilling</b> process monitoring (DPM). Case examples are given to show the original DPM data and analyzed results in a weathered rock mass. The <b>drilling</b> <b>machines</b> in the examples are pneumatic rotary-percussive <b>drilling</b> <b>machines</b> with down-the-hole hammers. The DPM data can directly show the in-situ rock mass drilling resistance strengths and their spatial distribution along the drillhole in the ground. The DPM is a simple, reliable and practical tool for furthering the practice and knowledge of rock mechanics and engineering in the underground environments comprising weathered soils and rocks. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|<b>Drilling</b> <b>machine</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} machine tools in industry except lathe and frais <b>machine.</b> <b>Drilling</b> <b>machine</b> has an important role on production proceses. But, vibration while drilling operation that caused by chatter or machine faults made the product output failure. One of the machine faults types is mass unbalance that can reduce the quality of product geometry. Therefore, dynamic behaviour analyze is necessary to prevent this mass unbalance will not happen. So, we did the dynamic behaviour analyze of <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> used ANSYS 11. 0 Workbench. The aim of this research is to find out the natural frequency and the mode shape of <b>drilling</b> <b>machine,</b> could to display their mode shape deformation with damping caused by excitation forces 100 N, and could to display FRF and FFT graphics caused by mass unbalance. In order to achieve the aims, modal analysis method has been adopted. Here, principal structures and their material which influence the stiffness of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> were modeled used SolidWork 2007 software. The <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> were modeled in three configuration of head body position. Software ANSYS 11. 0 Workbench used to determine FRF. As the results, the different configuration of head body position has been influence the dynamic behaviour structure that can be signed with the different of natural frequency. More higher the natural frequency, more higher the stiffness and it’s allow the structure difficult to vibrate. From the FRF, we know that the increase operation rotation of <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> allow higher vibration velocity that caused by mass unbalance. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{generally}} {{about how the}} mechanical system reacts when a load is given or friction is happen to touch the mechanical system. Every mechanical system will always be affected {{when there is a}} disturbance. Drilling operation is one of the common operations in the industry. When the drilling operation works, there must be a friction occurs when the work is done. Thus, there will be lack of performance for the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> The lack of the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> will lead to the speed of the machine that will decrease slightly. That is the main part of this project. To make the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> maintain, the speed must be increase as soon the friction is given to the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> To solve the problem, the Fuzzy Logic Method is use in this project. Using Fuzzy Logic Method, new equation will be finding and use it for this project. From the method, the speed of the motor will increase when the drilling operation is given a friction. There will be feedback for the error that the sensors detect from the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> The feedback will calculate the error and from the calculation the new increasing voltage will be determined. For the conclusion, the method is trying to find the new voltage for the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> to maintain the speed of the machine. From the fact, we know that when the voltage in increase, the speed will also increase. Thus, the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> will become more efficient...|$|R
