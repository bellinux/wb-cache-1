However, As the dynamic behavior and response characteristics of a practical MSCS with <b>active</b> <b>control</b> is different from the MSCS which is only installed additional dampers, it is necessary to further investigate its control mechanism and control effectiveness. In this paper, a new control method is proposed which employ <b>active</b> <b>control</b> and passive dampers together to form a huge control system based on the particular conformation characteristic of MSCS. <b>Active</b> <b>control,</b> for mega-sub controlled structure subjected to seismic loads is investigated based on LQR algorithm. Dynamic equation and method to assembling parameter matrixes for the meg-sub controlled structure under seismic ground motions are presented. Moreover, the additional damping ratio, the weight matrixes are defined and a study of the two parameters that influences the response control effectiveness, control force and dynamic characteristic of the MSCS is discussed; the regulative relationship between additional damping ratio and <b>active</b> <b>control</b> parameter is also analyzed. The result indicates that the new structure employing <b>active</b> <b>control</b> can further reduce the responses of this building. With control parameter changes, the effectiveness that influences the dynamic responses of mega-frame and substructure by additional damping value is different.

The authors have already proposed intelligent fuzzy optimal <b>active</b> <b>control</b> (IFOAC) systems. IFOAC systems imitate intelligent activities of human brains such as prediction, adaptation, decision-kaking and so on. In IFOAC systems, objective and subjective judgements on the <b>active</b> <b>control</b> can be taken into account. However, IFOAC systems {{are considered to be}} suitable for far-field erathquake and control effect becomes small in case of near-field earthqaukes which include a few velosity pules with large amplitudes.

In HC systems, the fuzzy control systems are introduced as a reflective fuzzy <b>active</b> <b>control</b> (RFAC) system and imitates spinal reflection of human.

The wing's outer leading edge incorporates three-section slats, while the inboard sections have additional slats to generate vortex lift over the inner wing and high-energy air-flow along the tail fin to enhance high-angle of attack stability and prevent departure from controlled flight. The wing trailing edge is occupied by two-segmented elevons to provide pitch and roll control.
