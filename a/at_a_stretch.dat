25|$|After {{successful}} completion of the MBBS course, one has to compulsorily work in the hospital attached to the medical college {{or in any other}} approved hospital allowed in some medical colleges, for a period of one year. This posting is called the Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship or the House Surgeon in Tamil Nadu. The student gets the degree only after satisfactory completion of the CRRI. An Intern (also called an Internee or a CRRI) is posted in all the clinical departments of the hospital on a rotation basis. This gives him or her the basic clinical and practical knowledge about all the disciplines of medicine and makes the medical graduate fit to work in the community as a General Physician. The schedules of an intern is usually extremely exhaustive. For example, one may have to work for the whole night and then have to start the next day duty only after about one or two hours. This may last till the afternoon. 24-hour sleepless duty <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>stretch</b> is not uncommon and sometimes the scheduled breaks are also not allowed by the superiors. He or she is also paid a monthly stipend for his work in the hospital which differs in different medical colleges {{on the basis of the}} management. The person is licensed to practice medicine only after completion of this internship. And only after finishing internship, one can receive his MBBS degree and can pursue postgraduate studies. The Interns are entrusted with clinical responsibilities under the supervision of a Medical teacher or a Resident/ PGT/ Senior medical officer. Interns are not supposed to issue medical certificates, death certificates or medico-legal documents under their own signatures.|$|E

500|$|Elephants {{can move}} both {{forwards}} and backwards, but cannot trot, jump, or gallop. They use only two gaits when moving on land, the walk and a faster gait similar to running.

With no [...] "aerial phase", the fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running, although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals, with the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet are on the ground.

500|$|The clay for {{the bricks}} was dug from river banks (of the Waal, Rhine, and IJssel rivers) and other open-air locations, and was left outside (in a mound called the kleibult) {{through the winter}} so that any organic {{material}} could decay; the weather (rain, frost, drought) helped make the clay more manageable. At {{the end of this}} period the clay was mixed with sand and other materials, a process done by foot, by workers stomping on the clay. It was then molded into the proper shape by an artisan, the tichelaar ("brickmaker"). Children handed the brickmaker the raw material and removed the shaped bricks. Child labor was common in the industry: until well into the nineteenth century children eight years old and younger worked 16 hours per day, and children four years old stacked and carried bricks for hours <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>stretch.</b> Molds were moistened with water and strewn with sand to enable the shaped brick to be more easily removed. The [...] "raw" [...] or [...] "green" [...] stones were laid out in long rows to dry and when they were dry enough they were stood up on their side so the bottom could dry; this work was often done by women and children. Often it was the women who did the much heavier labor of moving the dried bricks to the ovens, hauling wheelbarrows with loads of up to 80 kilograms, and stacking and preparing the ovens and tending to the fire (which burned peat or coal). Ovens came in two types—a single-use construction of the kind used in the production of charcoal, and a more permanent type, basically consisting of two walls one meter and a half thick. Ovens could hold up to a million bricks. Masonry bricks were fired between [...] and , klinkers between [...] and [...] Typically, bricks were baked at low heat for two weeks to remove all remaining moisture from the clay, and then for four weeks at a higher temperature, followed by two weeks of cooling down.|$|E

The region was facing droughts and this festival will mean thousands of people turning up and staying at Shirali for 3–4 days <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>stretch.</b> But Swamiji's ardent desire prevailed and thus the festival was restarted. During the Sādhana Saptāha (Week of Sadhana- See Sādhana Saptāha) in Bombay in 1972 He told the community that the reasons for starting the festival was not much because of the improved financial condition of the matha nor the large number of people wanting it restarted. The principal objective was, Swamiji stressed, that the lore of the rites, rituals and essential forms of the Rathōtsav ceremonies was within full knowledge of {{only a limited number of}} priests, and with disuse, this knowledge would dwindle, leading possibly to ultimate extinction. He even hinted that He had plans to restart the festival in 1969 but could not because of certain pressures.|$|E
