50|$|<b>Alfentanil</b> (R-39209, {{trade name}} Alfenta, Rapifen in Australia) {{is a potent}} but short-acting {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic drug, used for anaesthesia in surgery. It is an analogue of fentanyl with around 1/4 to 1/10 the potency of fentanyl and around 1/3 of the duration of action, but with an onset of effects 4x faster than fentanyl. <b>Alfentanil</b> has a pKa of approximately 6.5, {{which leads to a}} very high proportion of the drug being uncharged at physiologic pH. This unique characteristic is responsible for its rapid onset. It is an agonist at mu opioid receptors.|$|E

This study examined the clinically effective dose of <b>alfentanil</b> for suppressing cough during emergence from desflurane anesthesia. Methods: Twenty-nine adult patients undergoing elective oral surgery were enrolled in this study. During emergence from anesthesia, the patients received <b>alfentanil</b> diluted in 10 ml normal saline when the end-tidal vol % of desflurane decreased to 3 %. The initial <b>alfentanil</b> dose was 16 μg/kg.

The same general anaesthesia regimen was used in all patients. One group of patients were given intra-operative morphine analgesia followed by postoperative intravenous morphine patient-controlled analgesia, while the other group received an intra-operative target-controlled infusion of <b>alfentanil.</b> Following surgery, the <b>alfentanil</b> group were given control of a handset {{and were able to}} increase the target <b>alfentanil</b> plasma level in 5 ng. ml- 1 increments with a 2 -min lockout interval. If analgesia was not demanded within a 15 -min period, the computer reduced the target concentration by 5 ng. ml- 1. All patients had continuous pulse oximetry monitoring and hourly recording of pain, sedation, nausea scores and respiratory rate. Patients receiving <b>alfentanil</b> had the target concentration noted hourly and four blood samples taken during the first 24 h for measurement of plasma <b>alfentanil</b> concentrations by high performance liquid chromatography. The <b>alfentanil</b> infusion system was equally effective as an analgesic technique when compared with morphine patient-controlled analgesia. There were no hypoxaemic episodes (oxygen saturation < 94 %), no difference in sedation scores and the incidence of nausea (30 %) was the same in both groups. There was a significantly (p < 0. 001) lower respiratory rate in the <b>alfentanil</b> group compared with patients receiving morphine at, clinically assessed, equianalgesia.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: (i) To {{evaluate}} the pupillary response to <b>alfentanil</b> {{as a surrogate}} measure of <b>alfentanil</b> pharmacokinetics in cirrhotic patients and to compare the data observed in cirrhotic patients with those found in healthy volunteers (historical control group); and (ii) to compare this test with other liver function tests in cirrhotic patients. METHODS: Six patients with mild cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grade A) and six patients with moderate cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grade B) were studied after a single 15 microg/kg bolus of <b>alfentanil.</b> <b>Alfentanil</b> plasma concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and pupillary responses were measured with a Pupilscan II pupillometer. <b>Alfentanil</b> pharmacokinetics (plasma concentration, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity [AUC(infinity(p)) ] and from time zero to 2 hours [AUC(2 (p)) ], apparent volume of distribution at steady state, clearance and terminal elimination half-life [t((1 / 2) (p)) ]) and miosis pseudo-kinetic parameters [AUC(infinity) ((miosis)), AUC(2) ((miosis)), t((1 / 2)) ((miosis)) ] were determined using a noncompartmental analysis method. In six patients (three Child-Pugh grade A and three Child-Pugh grade B), antipyrine (measure of liver intrinsic activity) and D-sorbitol (measure of liver blood flow) tests were performed. RESULTS: A significant correlation {{was found between the}} <b>alfentanil</b> AUC(infinity(p)) and AUC(infinity) ((miosis)) (r = 0. 6, p < 0. 05) in cirrhotic patients. This correlation was even more significant if AUC determinations were limited to the first 2 hours after <b>alfentanil</b> administration (r = 0. 9, p < 0. 01). Statistically significant differences in pharmacokinetics and miosis pseudo-kinetic parameters were observed between cirrhotic patients and healthy volunteers from our previous experiment (historical control group). The correlations were significant between <b>alfentanil</b> clearance and antipyrine clearance (n = 6, r = 0. 9, p < 0. 05), <b>alfentanil</b> clearance and steady-state hepatic blood clearance [CL(H(b)) ] measured by the D-sorbitol test (n = 6, r = 0. 9, p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: <b>Alfentanil</b> pharmacokinetic parameters were correlated with miosis pseudo-kinetic parameters in cirrhotic patients. There was a significant decrease in pharmacokinetics and miosis pseudo-kinetics in cirrhotic patients compared with volunteers from the historical control group. Alfentanil-induced miosis has the advantage of being noninvasive and can be limited to miosis measurements during the first 2 hours after <b>alfentanil</b> administration in cirrhotic patients.

40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that high dose systemic <b>alfentanil</b> administered before and during abdominal hysterectomy would pre-empt post-operative pain {{to a greater extent}} than administration of either low dose <b>alfentanil</b> or no <b>alfentanil</b> perioperatively. Patients (ASA 1 or 2) were randomly assigned to group 1 (n = 15), no opioid; group 2 (n = 15), low dose alfentanil; or group 3 (n = 15), high dose <b>alfentanil.</b> Anaesthesia was induced in group 1 with midazolam and thiopentone and was maintained with isoflurane and 70 % N 2 O in O 2. Anaesthesia was induced in group 2 with midazolam, thiopentone and i. v. <b>alfentanil</b> (30 μg kg− 1), and was maintained with isoflurane, 70 % N 2 O in O 2, and bolus doses of i. v. <b>alfentanil</b> (10 – 20 μg kg− 1) every hour. Anaesthesia was induced in group 3 with midazolam and i. v. <b>alfentanil</b> (100 μg kg− 1), and was maintained with 70 % N 2 O in O 2, and an infusion of i. v. <b>alfentanil</b> (1 – 2 μg kg− 1 min− 1).

40|$|Rationale : Methoclocinnamox (MC-CAM) {{possesses}} initial partial µ-opioid agonist {{activity with}} subsequent long-lasting µ-antagonist effects. This profile of activity {{is similar to}} that of buprenorphine, a compound with proposed use in the treatment of opioid abuse, suggesting a possible therapeutic use for MC-CAM as well. Objective : The current study assessed the time course of the ability of MC-CAM and buprenorphine to antagonize the reinforcing effects of <b>alfentanil</b> and compared this with that of buprenorphine. Methods : Rhesus monkeys self-administered a range of doses of <b>alfentanil</b> (0. 03 – 1 µg/kg per injection) under a fixed-ratio 30, time-out 45 s schedule of i. v. drug delivery. MC-CAM was substituted for <b>alfentanil</b> on occasion, and a dose of 1. 0 mg/kg MC-CAM or buprenorphine was given prior to sessions in which <b>alfentanil</b> was available. In the pretreatment studies, a wider range of <b>alfentanil</b> doses was utilized (0. 03 – 30 µg/kg per injection). Results : MC-CAM maintained self-administration behavior and was nearly equipotent with buprenorphine as a reinforcer in this para digm. Both drugs, when given prior to a session in which <b>alfentanil</b> was available, produced a decrease in the reinforcing potency of <b>alfentanil.</b> The antagonist effects of the pretreatments were largest 30 min following administration and decreased over the next several days. The duration of MC-CAM’s antagonism of <b>alfentanil</b> was approximately 4 days; the duration of buprenorphine as an antagonist was approximately 2 days. Conclusion : These data suggest that MC-CAM has a longer duration of antagonist effects than buprenorphine and it may therefore have an advantage in the treatment of opioid abuse...|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the cardiovascular responses to double-lumen endobronchial intubation during rapid sequence induction of anesthesia, and compared the effect of remifentanil and <b>alfentanil</b> in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in three groups of 20 elderly patients each. Methods: Anesthesia was induced with intravenous thiopental (4 － 6 mg/kg) immediately followed by either remifentanil 2 μg/kg, <b>alfentanil</b> 30 μg/kg, or saline (placebo) given over 30 sec. Succinylcholine 1. 5 mg/kg was given for neuromuscular block. The laryngoscopy and intubation were performed 60 sec later. Results: The intubation significantly increased systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and heart rate (HR) in all groups. The maximum pressure changes in the remifentanil and <b>alfentanil</b> groups (36 ± 26 and 33 ± 30 mmHg, respectively) were {{significantly lower than the}} 83 ± 35 mmHg in the control group. The maximum HR in the remifentanil (77 ± 13 bpm) and <b>alfentanil</b> (80 ± 13 bpm) groups was lower when compared to controls (93 ± 11 bpm). The norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations in-creased after intubation in the control group but remained unaltered in both the <b>alfentanil</b> and remifentanil groups.

The proportion of patients who developed sore throat was also less in the <b>alfentanil</b> group than in the suxamethonium group (P < 0. 05). The proportion of patients who complained of nausea in the two groups was not significantly different. We conclude that <b>alfentanil,</b> as an adjunct to propofol to facilitate trachea/ intubation, is more acceptable to patients than suxamethonium in anaesthesia for day-cas...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} CCAM, an insurmountable mu opioid {{receptor}} antagonist, were studied on the intravenous self-administration and thermoantinociception of <b>alfentanil</b> and nalbuphine, high- and low-efficacy opioid agonists, respectively, in rhesus monkeys. A single dose of 0. 1 mg/kg CCAM IV reduced alfentanil’s reinforcing potency in an FR 30 TO 45 s schedule 10 -fold within a 24 -h period. The maximum response rates remained essentially unchanged. At 1 mg/kg, CCAM caused a 300 -fold {{shift of the}} <b>alfentanil</b> dose-response curve and also depressed the maximum response rates. CCAM also blocked insurmountably responding for nalbuphine, which was essentially abolished in two of three animals after a dose of 0. 1 mg/kg CCAM and in all animals after 1 mg/kg. The acute insurmountable antagonism of <b>alfentanil</b> and nalbuphine self-administration by CCAM {{was used to determine}} the (relative initial) efficacy values of both agonists. Efficacy values, tau, were 391 for <b>alfentanil</b> and 196 for nalbuphine; the apparent in vivo dissociation constants, K A, were 0. 16 mg/kg per injection (i. e., 350 nmol/kg per injection) for <b>alfentanil</b> and 0. 14 mg/kg (370 nmol/kg per injection) for nalbuphine. In comparison, in a rhesus monkey 50 °C warm-water tail withdrawal assay, the tau values were 11 for <b>alfentanil</b> and 0. 92 for nalbuphine, and the K A values were 0. 2 mg/kg (440 nmol/kg) for <b>alfentanil</b> and 0. 15 mg/kg (400 nmol/kg) for nalbuphine. Therefore, it seems that the higher potency of <b>alfentanil</b> and nalbuphine in self-administration as compared to thermal antinociception in rhesus monkeys is predominantly due to a larger efficacy of the same agonist in self-administration (i. e., a larger receptor pool) rather than differences in apparent in vivo affinity...|$|E
40|$|This {{randomized}} controlled double-blind trial {{was designed to}} compare the presence of Airway-Circulatory Reflexes to tracheal extubation in groups administering IV <b>alfentanil</b> or lidocaine, in 150 patients undergoing cesarean surgery receiving a standardized anesthetic protocol. At the end of surgery, after return of spontaneous ventilation, patients received either <b>alfentanil</b> 15 μg kg - 1 or lidocaine 1. 5 mg kg - 1. The presence of cough and it`s severity during emergence before extubation was noted. BP and HR were recorded at 2 min after end of surgery (baseline), 2 min after study drug administration and 1 min after extubation. The groups were matched according to age, baseline BP and HR. The incidence of coughing was less frequent in the <b>alfentanil</b> than in the lidocaine group (19 % versus 75 %, respectively, p< 0. 001). Although the severity of coughing was considerably different between two groups (lower in <b>alfentanil</b> g) but was not statistically different (p = 0. 292). The mean BP and HR were lower in <b>alfentanil</b> than lidocaine group 2 min after administration and 1 min after extubation (p< 0. 001). The median of delay time (time between the study drug administration and extubation) was 6 min in <b>alfentanil</b> (Range: 4 - 8) and 5 min in lidocaine groups (Range: 4 - 8) (p< 0. 001). These results indicate that <b>alfentanil</b> decreases Airway-Circulatory Reflexes more than lidocaine during emergence from anesthesia without clinically important prolonging the time to extubation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alfentanil</b> is {{a potent}} and short-acting mu opioid agonist that {{produces}} both antinociceptive effects and muscle rigidity. In the present study, the susceptibility of alfentanil-induced antinoci-ception and rigidity to antagonism by the selective mu antagonist 9 -funaItrexamine and the selective mu-i antagonist naloxonazine was examined. <b>Alfentanil</b> (37. 7 - 1 50. 0 g/kg) produced a dose-dependent increase both in antinociception {{as measured by the}} warm-water tail-dip assay and in rigidity as measured by electro-myographic recording of the gastrocnemius muscle. Both fi-funaltrexamine (10. 0 and 20. 0 mg/kg) and naloxonazine (7. 5 and 1 5. 0 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent and parallel rightward shifts in the <b>alfentanil</b> dose-effect curves for both antinociception and rigidity.

40|$|<b>Alfentanil,</b> a new short-acting {{narcotic}} analgesic, was {{studied as}} a continuous infusion for surgical procedures of medium and long duration in 80 patients. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone immediately followed by 1 mg of <b>alfentanil</b> to attenuate the stress response to intubation. <b>Alfentanil</b> 100 micrograms/kg was then slowly given as a loading dose before surgery started and anaesthesia maintained by a continuous infusion {{at a rate of}} 0. 5 - 1 micrograms/kg/min.
