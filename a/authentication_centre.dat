So, cloud environment always remains vulnerable to attacks. Theframework serves as an excellent platform for making cloud services intrusion tolerant. The feasibility of theframework has been tested by making cloud’s Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Data Storage Serviceintrusion tolerant. The proposed framework has been validated by integratingIntrusion Tolerance via Threshold Cryptography (ITTC) mechanism in the simulated cloud’s IaaS. For this,the data <b>centre</b> <b>authentication</b> key is distributed among the hosts using Shamir Secret Sharing algorithm.

The correctness of user’sdata is ensured by using erasure-correcting code in the file distribution preparation to provide redundancyparity vectors.

Although the {{security}} properties of 3 G and 4 G mobile net-works have significantly improved {{by comparison with}} 2 G (GSM), sig-nificant shortcomings remain with respect to user privacy. A number of possible modifications to 2 G, 3 G and 4 G protocols have been proposed designed to provide greater user privacy; however, they all require sig-nificant alterations to the existing deployed infrastructures, which are almost certainly impractical to achieve in practice. In this article we propose an approach which does not require any changes to the exist-ing deployed network infrastructures, i. e. to the serving networks or the mobile devices, but offers improved user identity protection over the air interface. The proposed scheme makes use of multiple IMSIs for an in-dividual USIM to offer a degree of pseudonymity for a user.

40|$|In British English {{the term}} 'accent' refers to {{systematic}} variations in pronunciation, {{often associated with}} particular geographic regions. Accent {{is one of the}} most frequently cited causes of variability in speech. The problem of accents is becoming more important with the advancement of computerised services and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Speech recognition technology is used in a wide range of applications and services such as health care, education, automated call <b>centres,</b> <b>authentication</b> and information services. In many of these applications accents and foreign languages posed a problem for speech recognition developers because, if the people using the system could not be understood, they might become frustrated and stop using the system. For example, a recent news story reported that an automated phone system deployed by Birmingham City Council could not cope with ‘Brummie’ accents [1]. This research investigates how we can exploit the knowledge of accents to obtain both rapid and robust ASR systems for British accented utterances using only 30 seconds of speech. When we hear another person’s speech for the first time, we quickly establish a 'profile' of that person based on his or her speech, in terms of factors such as gender, age, accent, and social group. It is possible that we use this characterization to adapt very quickly to that person’s speech. Current ASR systems typically differentiate between genders, but otherwise tend to ignore important factors including accents. Additionally, conventional adaptation techniques for ASR require a substantial amount of training material from each individual to be able to adapt the system in order to have a more user specific system. Now the question is whether the concept of ‘regional accent’ is useful to overcome these two problems. The first section describes the techniques used to visualise the space where accent recognition is performed, otherwise known as the ‘accent recognition’ space, and show the extent to which the emergent structure is consistent with subjective notions of accent. The two techniques used are Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We then interpret speech recognition results on accented speech from 14 different British regions, analysed in terms of their structure in the ‘accent recognition’ space. Following this we present results on accent adaptation using conventional adaptation techniques such as MAP (Maximum A Posteriori Adaptation) and MLLR (Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression). We use these accent adaptation techniques along with the knowledge from accent recognition techniques, such as the ACCDIST accent recognition measure, to provide an accent robust, rapid speaker adaptation system. 1. 	“Brummie accents baffle automated phone system [...] . at Birmingham City Council”, Daily Mail, 5 th November 2012. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{report will}} give {{information}} on the 3 rd generation mobile communication system, UMTS, its Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) procedures and security aspects. It will also describe the ‘UMTS AKA Illustrator’ which is an animation program we have created to explain the AKA procedures. The AKA procedure {{is the essence of}} authenticating a user to the network and vice versa. This is possible due to the pre-shared secret key K stored in the <b>Authentication</b> <b>Centre</b> (AuC) and in the UMTS Subscriber Identity Module (USIM). The other parameters are derived from this key. During an AKA procedure, messages with parameters to be confirmed by the User Equipment (UE), are delivered from AuC. Such parameters are joined together in an Authentication Vector (AV). The AV is delivered to the Core Network, which distributes parts of this AV through the access network to the UE. The UE must then perform some calculations to match this challenge. The result of the UE is sent back and checked against the AV where it originated. If the result matches, then the authentication is successful. If the result fails some other procedures are activated to correct the problem. The above description is successfully animated using Flash technology. This animation we have called: ‘UMTS AKA Illustrator’ and {{is the result of a}} literature study of 3 GPP specifications. This illustrator is developed for making the AKA procedures easier to understand for people without the deeper knowledge of UMTS. The illustrator can be used as a stand-alone application for educational purposes, with easy web access on multiple platforms. AKA procedures in UMTS have increased security compared with GSM.
