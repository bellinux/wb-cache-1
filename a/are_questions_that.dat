25|$|Many {{tasks that}} we would like to {{automate}} by using a computer are of question–answer type: we would like to ask a question and the computer should produce an answer. In theoretical computer science, such tasks are called computational problems. Formally, a computational problem consists of instances together with a solution for each instance. Instances <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> we can ask, and solutions are desired answers to these questions.|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} {{reported}} effect of culture on performance is that strong cultures result in high performance. The three {{reasons for this}} are goal alignment, motivation, and the resulting structure provided. Goal alignment {{is driven by the}} proposed unified voice that drives employees in the same direction. Motivation comes from the strength of values and principles in such a culture. And structure is provided by these same attributes which obviate the need for formal controls that could stifle employees. There <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> concern researchers about causality and the veracity of the driving voice of a strong culture.|$|E
25|$|During a quiz bowl game, {{two or more}} {{teams of}} usually up to four or five players are read {{questions}} by a moderator. In most forms of quiz bowl, {{there are two basic}} types of questions: toss-ups and bonuses. Toss-ups <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> any individual player can attempt to answer, and players are generally not allowed to confer with each other. Each player usually has a signaling device, also called a buzzer, to signal in {{at any time during the}} question to give an answer. If the answer given is incorrect, then no other member of that team may give an answer. If a toss-up is successfully answered, the correctly answering team is given an opportunity to answer a bonus. Bonuses are usually worth a total of 30 points, and consist of three individual questions worth ten points each. Team members are generally permitted to confer with each other on these questions.|$|E

60|$|And here we {{may give}} {{a few words}} to certain {{questions}} that are in reality outside the scope of Socialists altogether, special questions involving the most subtle ethical and psychological decisions. Upon them Socialists are as widely divergent as people who are not Socialists, and Socialism as a whole presents nothing but an open mind. They <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> would be equally open to discussion in relation to an Individualist State or to any sort of State. Certain religious organizations have given clear and imperative answers to some or all of these questions, and so far as the reader is a member of such an organization, he may rest assured that Socialism, as an authoritative whole, has nothing to say for or against his convictions. This cannot be made too plain by Socialists, nor too frequently repeated by them. A very large part of the so-called arguments against them arise out of deliberate misrepresentations and misconceptions of some alleged Socialist position in these indifferent matters.|$|E
6000|$|We {{are still}} too near that period to make a history of it, {{for the simple reason}} that a true history implies {{distance}} and perspective. No historian could read, much less measure and compare, a tenth part of the books that have won recognition since 1876. In such works as he might select as typical he must be governed by his own taste or judgment; and the writer was never born who could by such personal standards forecast the judgment of time and of humanity. In a word, contemporary or [...] "up-to-date" [...] histories are vain attempts at the impossible; save in the unimportant matter of chronicling names or dates they are all alike untrustworthy. The student should bear in mind, therefore, that the following summary of our recent literature is based largely upon personal opinion; that it selects a few authors by way of illustration, omitting many others who may be of equal or greater importance. We are confronted by a host of books that serve the prime purpose of literature by giving pleasure; but what proportion of them are enduring books, or what few of them will be known to readers of the next century as the Sketch Book and Snow-Bound are known to us,--these <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> only Father Time can answer.|$|E
60|$|And this is {{the curious}} feature of Jeypore; though happily the city is not unique in its peculiarity. When the late Maharaja ascended the throne, {{more than fifty years}} ago, it was his royal will and {{pleasure}} that Jeypore should advance. Whether he was prompted by love for his subjects, desire for praise, or the magnificent vanity with which Jey Singh must have been so largely dowered, <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> concern nobody. In the latter years of his reign, he was supplied with Englishmen who made the State their fatherland, and identified themselves with its progress as only Englishmen can. Behind them stood the Maharaja ready to spend money with a lavishness that no Supreme Government would dream of; and it would not be too much to say that they together made the State what it is. When Ram Singh died, Madho Singh, his successor, a conservative Hindu, forbore to interfere in any way with the work that was going forward. It is said in the city that he does not overburden himself with the cares of State, the driving power being mainly {{in the hands of a}} Bengali, who has everything but the name of Minister. Nor do the Englishmen, it is said in the city, mix themselves with the business of government; their business being wholly executive.|$|E

6000|$|That the {{pamphlet}} should create intense excitement, was inevitable {{from the place}} of the writer in the public eye, from the extraordinary vehemence of the attack, and above all from the unquenchable fascination of the topic. Whether the excitement in the country was more than superficial; whether most readers fathomed the deep issues as they stood, not between catholic and protestant, but between catholic and catholic within the fold; whether in fastening upon the civil allegiance of English Romanists Mr. Gladstone took the true point against Vaticanism—these <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> we need not here discuss. The central proposition made a cruel dilemma for a large class of the subjects of the Queen; for the choice assigned to them by assuming stringent logic was between being bad citizens if they submitted to the decree of papal infallibility, and bad catholics if they did not. Protestant logicians wrote to Mr. Gladstone that if his contention were good, we ought now to repeal catholic emancipation and again clap on the fetters. Syllogisms in action are but stupid things after all, unless they are checked by a tincture of what seems paradox.(321) Apart from the particular issue in his Vatican pamphlet, Mr. Gladstone believed himself to be but following his own main track in life and thought in his assault upon “a policy which declines to acknowledge the high place assigned to liberty in the counsels of Providence, and which upon the pretext of the abuse that like every other good she suffers, expels her from its system.” ...|$|E
