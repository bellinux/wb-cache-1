40|$|A magnetorheological (MR) damper {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{advanced}} devices used in a semiactive control system to mitigate unwanted vibration because the damping force can be controlled by changing the viscosity of the internal magnetorheological (MR) fluids. This study proposes a typical double coil MR damper where the damping force and dynamic range were derived from a quasistatic model based on the Bingham model of MR fluid. A finite element model was built to study the performance of this double coil MR damper by investigating seven different piston configurations, including the numbers and shapes <b>of</b> their <b>chamfered</b> <b>ends.</b> The objective function of an optimization problem was proposed and then an optimization procedure was constructed using the ANSYS parametric design language (APDL) to obtain the optimal damping performance of a double coil MR damper. Furthermore, experimental tests were also carried out, and the effects of the same direction and reverse direction of the currents on the damping forces were also analyzed. The relevant results of this analysis can easily be extended to the design of other types of MR dampers...|$|R

The acoustic performance depends upon the cavity length, jet-to-cavity-spacing and external chamfer angle (15 °, 30 °, and 45 °). The modifications in spectral and directional characteristics <b>of</b> external <b>chamfered</b> Hartmann whistles {{are studied in detail}} and are compared with a regular cavity. The frequencies are observed to attain a minimum value at a <b>chamfer</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 30 ° along with modification in the acoustic spectra. In general, it is noticed that the external chamfered whistles are directive at an emission <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> around 45 ° where it is around 37 ° for a regular whistle. Numerical simulations portray the flow/shock oscillation features in external chamfered cavities. Simulations depict intense flow diversion at the mouth <b>of</b> <b>chamfered</b> cavities and elucidate the directivity shift as well as the enhancement of acoustic power observed experimentally. Thus, it is observed that Hartmann whistles with external chamfering could radiate acoustic power up to 2. 3 times that of a non-chamfered whistle...|$|R

This research investigates the effects <b>of</b> <b>chamfer</b> width and chamfer angle on process variables (force, stress, tool temperature and tool stress) in machining of a mild carbon low alloy steel by a cemented carbide tool using finite element method. The simulations show that the dead metal zone created under the tool acts as the effective cutting edge of the tool and increases the cutting forces.

40|$|Linear Induction Motor (LIM) {{which is}} also known as non-adhesion drive system has been chosen as {{propulsion}} system for most of mass transit railway all over the world. This is due to several advantages such as quiet and smooth running, no mechanical coupling, capable of climbing steep gradients, excellent acceleration and deceleration, and less susceptibility to weather condition. However, the disadvantages of LIM is it has finite length of the primary or secondary parts thus causes end effects also called discontinuous airgap flux phenomenon. Assymmetric airgap magnetic flux density at end parts of LIM produces unbalanced normal force which is airgap tends to increase at the entry and decrease at the exit part. This unbalanced normal force adversely affect the performance of the LIM propulsion system. Main objective of this research is to reduce magnetic flux leakage that leads to end effect phenomenon thus proves effectiveness method <b>of</b> <b>chamfering</b> in weakening <b>end</b> effect phenomenon. In this research, there will be 3 models of LIM. First is known as reference LIM which is LIM with no chamfered angle. Two others are LIM with chamfered angle 30 ° and 45 °. Software used in this research is JMAG-Designer. Reference and chamfered LIM 2 D models consists of mover (primary), coil, aluminium sheet, and stator (secondary) are created using Geometry Editor included in JMAG-Designer. After running analysis 3 different models of LIM following parameters given, results were displayed in the form of tables that indicates value of magnetic flux for 3 phase current (U, V, W). Graph is being drawn to make views of these results more clearly and precisely. X-axis in the graph indicates times whereas Y-axis in the graph indicates value of magnetic flux for 3 different model of LIM. After that, figure of distribution of magnetic flux density for 3 models of LIM is shown. From the results, chamfering is proven to reduce end effect at the LIM. At the <b>end,</b> <b>chamfered</b> angle 45 ° LIM has highest number of magnetic flux, least leakage flux, least end effect thus has highest thrust value for LIM propulsion system...|$|R

Thirty human premolars were prepared for full-coverage crowns with a convergence <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 6 degrees, <b>chamfer</b> margin <b>of</b> 1. 2 mm circumferentially, and occlusal reduction of 1. 5 mm. Ni-Cr cast crowns were cemented with either zinc phosphate (ZP) (S. S. White), resin-modified glass-ionomer (RMGI) (Rely X Luting Cement) or a resin-based luting agent (RC) (Enforce). Margin fit (seating discrepancy and margin gap) was evaluated according to criteria in the literature under microscope with 0. 001 mm accuracy. After thermal cycling, crowns were longitudinally sectioned and microleakage scores at tooth-cement interface were obtained and recorded at × 100 magnification. Margin fit parameters were compared with the one-way ANOVA test and microleakage scores with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests (alpha= 0. 05). Correlation between margin fit and microleakage was analyzed with the Spearman's test (alpha= 0. 05). Seating discrepancy and marginal gap values ranged from 81. 82 µm to 137. 22 µm (p= 0. 117), and from 75. 42 µm to 78. 49 µm (p= 0. 940), respectively. Marginal microleakage scores were ZP= 3. 02, RMGI= 0. 35 and RC= 0. 12 (p 0. 05). Conclusion: Margin fit parameters and microleakage showed no strong correlations; cast crowns cemented with RMGI and RC had lower microleakage scores than ZP cement...|$|R
