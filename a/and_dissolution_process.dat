This model was developed in earlier work with the purpose of being a tool for control design. Because of the precipitation in form of hydroxides and the limited dissolution rate of nickel carbonate, the process is approximately linear in pH. Therefore, an alternative strategy for pH control based on adding derivative and feed forward action is suggested.

40|$|Abstract. The {{sintering}} <b>and</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>process</b> (SDP) {{is a novel}} {{method for}} manufacturing Al foams. One concern of the process {{is the presence of}} residual NaCl in the as manufactured Al foams under certain circumstances, which may have undesirable effects on the properties of the foams. This paper develops a stochastic model to predict the fraction of entrapped NaCl based on the assumptions that the particles of the Al and NaCl powders used in SDP are spherical and monosized and that they are distributed randomly in the preform. The model predicts that the fraction of entrapped NaCl in the foam decreases with increasing volume fraction of NaCl in the preform and with decreasing NaCl-to-Al particle size ratio. The model predictions are in general agreements with the preliminary experimental measurements. The model provides a basis for the selection of Al and NaCl powders in order to minimise the entrapped NaCl in the foam...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} the {{specific}} surface area (SSA) of powders is not sufficiently described in the literature {{in spite of its}} nontrivial contribution to adsorption <b>and</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>processes.</b> Fractal geometry provides a way to determine this parameter via relation SSA ~ x(D − 3) s(2 − D), where x (m) is the particle size and s (m) is a scale. Such a relation respects nano-, micro-, or macro-topography on the surface. Within this theory, the fractal dimension 2 ≤ D < 3 and scale parameter s plays a significant role. The parameter D may be determined from BET or dissolution measurements on several samples, changing the powder particle sizes or sizes of adsorbate molecules. If the fractality of the surface is high, the SSA does not depend on the particle size distribution and vice versa.

The findings suggest that women's entry into motherhood during full-time education is highly dependent on women's age, social origin and the policy measures in a country. Furthermore, women's education has mainly {{an effect on the}} time structure of entry into first motherhood over the life course of differently qualified women but not on their final decision to enter into motherhood.

Etch rates and photocurrents in an anhydrous HF-acetonitrile (MeCN) solution {{have been found to be}} directly proportional to light intensity up to at least 600 mW/cm 2, producing a spatially selective etch rate of greater than 4 i~m/min. Four electron transfer eactions per silicon molecule were observed with a quantum yield greater than 3. 3 due to electron injection from high energy reaction intermediates. The lectrochemical oxidation of p-Si in HF-MeCN results in the formation of porous silicon which electroluminesces in an aqueous solution. This shows that molecular hydrogen, and silicon-oxygen species are not necessary in the generation of porous silicon to observe electroluminescence. In an aprotic electrolyte, where tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate was used as both the supporting electrolyte and source of fluoride in MeCN, photo-induced etching of n-Si was observed with a quantum efficiency of 1. 9.

In the FPC process, no external heat source was used for fabricating 	porous Cu except for the friction heat generated by the rotating tool plunged into the die 	and powders. From the X-ray CT and SEM observation of the pore structures of the 	fabricated porous Cu, it was found that almost the entire specimen had a pore structure 	similar to the NaCl morphology, regardless of the NaCl volume fraction.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to propose a method of {{determining}} the exact value of disintegrant ratio in a binary drug-disintegrant compacted mixture for a minimum disintegration time in the case of spherical particles. Disintegration is a limiting factor in dissolution process of compact for low water soluble active ingredients. As disintegration time is shortest at a certain ratio of disintegrant, a calculation of this value is important for solid dosage from design to enhance disintegration <b>and</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>process.</b> According to percolation theory, a minimum disintegration time corresponds to the formation of a continuous water-conducting cluster through the entire tablet. The critical volumetric ratio at which the cluster is formed is named percolation threshold and has the value of 0. 16 for random close packed (RCP) sphere systems. RCP systems where chosen as the best model for compacts consisting of spherical particles. Two cases for water diffusion through the tablet were identified, according to geometrical considerations between disintegrant And drug particles. These cases determine if disintegrant particles can have a contact between each other within the compact and thus if porosity and disintegrant volume are included in the continuous cluster. An equation for both cases is presented in the form of piecewise function to determine the minimal disintegrant volumetric ratio for a binary drug/disintegrant compact in order to achieve a minimum disintegration time.

Their success {{would allow us to}} realize a sustainable society, enabling us to mitigate issues like global warming and resource depletion. Of such technologies, Magnesium (Mg) battery technologies have attracted attention as a high energy-density storage system due to the following advantages: (1) potentially high energy-density derived from a divalent nature, (2) low-cost due to the use of an earth abundant metal, and (3) intrinsic safety aspect attributed to non-dendritic growth of Mg. However, these notable advantages are downplayed by undesirable battery reactions and related phenomena. As a result, {{there are only a few}} working rechargeable Mg battery systems. One of the root causes for undesirable behavior is the sluggish diffusion of Mg 2 + inside a host lattice. Another root cause is the interfacial reaction at the electrode/electrolyte boundary. For the cathode/electrolyte interface, Mg 2 + in the electrolyte needs a solvation-desolvation process prior to diffusion inside the cathode. Apart from the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formed on the cathode, the divalent nature of Mg should cause kinetically slower solvation-desolvation processes than that of Li-ion systems. This would result in a high charge transfer resistance and a larger overpotential. On the contrary, for the anode/electrolyte interface, the Mg deposition <b>and</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>process</b> depends on the electrolyte nature and its compatibility with Mg metal. Also, the Mg metal/electrolyte interface tends to change over time, and with operating conditions, suggesting the presence of interfacial phenomena on the Mg metal.

40|$|Personalized {{nanomedicine}} {{has been}} shown to provide advantages over traditional clinical imaging, diagnosis, and conventional medical treatment. Using nanoparticles can enhance and clarify the clinical targeting and imaging, and lead them exactly to the place in the body that is the goal of treatment. At the same time, one can reduce the side effects that usually occur in the parts of the body that are not targets for treatment. Nanoparticles are of a size that can penetrate into cells. Their surface functionalization offers a way to increase their sensitivity when detecting target molecules. In addition, it increases the potential for flexibility in particle design, their therapeutic function, and variation possibilities in diagnostics. Mesoporous nanoparticles of amorphous silica have attractive physical and chemical characteristics such as particle morphology, controllable pore size, and high surface area and pore volume. Additionally, the surface functionalization of silica nanoparticles is relatively straightforward, which enables optimization of the interaction between the particles and the biological system. The main goal {{of this study was to}} prepare traceable and targetable silica nanoparticles for medical applications with a special focus on particle dispersion stability, biocompatibility, and targeting capabilities. Nanoparticle properties are highly particle-size dependent and a good dispersion stability is a prerequisite for active therapeutic and diagnostic agents. In the study it was shown that traceable streptavidin-conjugated silica nanoparticles which exhibit a good dispersibility could be obtained by the suitable choice of a proper surface functionalization route. Theranostic nanoparticles should exhibit sufficient hydrolytic stability to effectively carry the medicine to the target cells after which they should disintegrate and dissolve. Furthermore, the surface groups should stay at the particle surface until the particle has been internalized by the cell in order to optimize cell specificity. Model particles with fluorescently-labeled regions were tested in vitro using light microscopy and image processing technology, which allowed a detailed study of the disintegration <b>and</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>process.</b> The study showed that nanoparticles degrade more slowly outside, as compared to inside the cell. The main advantage of theranostic agents is their successful targeting in vitro and in vivo. Non-porous nanoparticles using monoclonal antibodies as guiding ligands were tested in vitro in order to follow their targeting ability and internalization. In addition to the targeting that was found successful, a specific internalization route for the particles could be detected. In the last part of the study, the objective was to clarify the feasibility of traceable mesoporous silica nanoparticles, loaded with a hydrophobic cancer drug, being applied for targeted drug delivery in vitro and in vivo. Particles were provided with a small molecular targeting ligand. In the study a significantly higher therapeutic effect could be achieved with nanoparticles compared to free drug. The nanoparticles were biocompatible and stayed in the tumor for a longer time than a free medicine did, before being eliminated by renal excretion.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a systematic {{investigation of the}} DHA-encapsulated particles. Special research attention {{was drawn to the}} particle drying behavior and surface phenomenon during and after the particle formation. As a heat and chemical sensitive substance, DHA is often errapsulated to decrease oxidation or to mask unpleasant taste and odour. Selection of the rest coating materials and micro-encapsulation process technology is crucial. In this study, different shell materials (protein-based and starch-based, respectively) were examined to indicate their feasibility for DHAoil encapsulation and to understand their drying behavior. Spray drying is a primary method to manufacture food and pharmaceutical powders. Before subjecting a new formulation (ingredient or wall material) to this process, informations about drying kinetics and shrinkage parameters, which are crucial to 100 del the spray drying process, can be obtained via single-droplet drying experiments. In this study, a glass filament method was adopted to measure the changes in droplet size, weight, and temperature during the drying of emulsion droplets containing DHA at specific solid-liquid ratios under hot air convection. The Reaction Engineering Approach (REA) could then be adopted to describe the drying behavior of the emulsion droplets, and correlate the shrinkage coefficients against the solids content. The heat transfer and mass transfer models of s~cific types of emulsion were also established. The REA model in this thesis has provided an accurate description of drying behaviour of the tested emulsion systems. Significant differerres could be found when comparing the present master curves with previous reJX>rted master curves. The early shell formation process was assumed to be the reason and was confirmed by the further studies. In addition, when an emulsion droplet was dried, the pro~rties of different dissolved solids could lead to different behaviors, for example, different shell formation process. Such phenomena could make droplet drying a very complex process to understand and also would affect the functionality of tre final dried particles. Thus, the surface phenomena of DHA-containing emulsion during convective droplet drying, with the associated functionality changes, were analyzed by the extended glass-filament single droplet drying approach to understand the mechanisms behind these changes. The in situ analysis of particle surface formation allowed changes in the dissolution behavior of tre semi-dried/dried particle to be monitored while droplet drying was in progress. By comparing the changes in dissolution behavior with different shell materials during drying, the possible material migration behavior during the DHA-containing emulsion droplet drying was examined and generated. Discussion based on visual observations of the emulsion morphologies, droplet drying behaviors <b>and</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>process</b> was presented. The quick crust formation processes of tre DHA-containing emulsion droplets during drying were verified. The surface characterization for DHA containing particle before and after surface oil extraction were also carried out to detect tre influence of different wall materials on the surfa:e formation and surface com}X) sition. The modified-starch showed a better protective property of tre oil than protein. The knowledge developed from this thesis will provide theoretical and technical support for the industrial-scale production of DHA-oil micro-capsule...|$|E
50|$|The aquifer {{is largely}} {{composed}} of hard ferruginous sandstone with great shale and clay intercalation, having a thickness that ranges between 140-230 meters. Groundwater type varies from fresh to slightly brackish (salinity ranges from 240-1300 ppm). The ion dominance ordering shows that sodium cation is most commonly predominating over calcium and magnesium - whereas chloride is predominant over sulfate and bicarbonate. The groundwater is of meteoric origin (the term meteoric water refers to water that originated as precipitation; most groundwater is meteoric in origin). High concentrations of sodium, chloride, and sulfates reflect the leaching <b>and</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>processes</b> of gypsiferous shales and clay, {{in addition to}} a lengthy duration of water residence.|$|R
40|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} (LIBs) {{have some}} serious safety problems, such as lithium dendrite formation during charging/discharging cycles that may cause internal short-circuiting, fires, and even explosions. A new double-scale in situ experimental setup, which can record all phenomena during the electrochemical testing, was developed. Lithium dendrite growth behavior of commercial LIBs during small-current-density charging {{at room temperature}} was observed in situ. The formation, growth, <b>and</b> <b>dissolution</b> of lithium dendrites, and dead lithium residue were all observed and recorded using this new experimental test system. A detailed model of lithium electrodeposition <b>and</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>processes</b> was proposed. The electrode structures were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The surface morphologies were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The texture and surface morphology of the graphite active layer affected lithium dendrite initiation {{as well as its}} growth processes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the electrolyte influence on deposition <b>and</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>processes</b> of Cu nanoparticles on boron doped diamond electrodes (BDD). Morphological, structural and electrochemical analysis showed BDD films with good reproducibility, quality and reversible {{in a specific}} redox system. Electrodeposition of Cu nanoparticles on DDB electrodes in three different solutions was influenced by pH and ionic strength of the electrolytic medium. Analyzing the process as function of the scan rate, it was verified a better efficiency in 0, 5 mol L- 1 Na 2 SO 4 solution. Under {{the influence of the}} pH and ionic strength, Cu nanoparticles on DDB may be obtained with different morphologies and it was important for defining the desired properties. Pages: 1 -...|$|R
40|$|This paper deals {{first with}} recent {{experimental}} data on equilibrium step flucuations on metal electrodes {{in contact with}} an electrolyte. The dynamics of steps on Cu(1 1 1) and Ag(1 1 1) electrodes is Studied {{as a function of}} the electrode potential and temperature. From the Arrhenius-like temperature dependence of the fluctuations we deduce pre-exponential factors and activation energies for surface diffusion <b>and</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>processes.</b> In the second part of the paper we discuss new results on island dynamics on Au(1 0 0) electrodes. From the time dependence of the island edge fluctuations and from the islands equilibrium shape we determine kink and step energies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
