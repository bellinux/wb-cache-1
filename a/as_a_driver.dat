5|$|Drivers can {{get away}} with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based log books. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>driver</b> records their time spent behind the wheel, there is very little to stop them from forging their log books. There is very {{superficial}} oversight and some drivers take advantage of this fact. Surveys indicate that between 25% and 75% of drivers violate the HOS. Other drivers maintain more than one log book, showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|E

5|$|NASCAR, {{and stock}} car racing in general, {{has its roots}} in bootlegging during Prohibition.

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939, Bessie left her union post and joined G Division of the Liverpool Ambulance Service, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>driver.</b> Initially her main job was to train other drivers, mostly young women. She became a section leader and then a deputy leader of G Division, an administrative post that should have kept her at headquarters. However, she records that she drove her ambulance through all the 68 major air raids that struck Liverpool during the war years. It was dangerous work; on a single day, 3May 1941, 14 drivers lost their lives. Bessie remained with the ambulance service almost {{until the end of}} the war in 1945.|$|E

5|$|Hill {{started his}} Grand Prix career during the 1991 {{season as a}} test driver with the championship-winning Williams team while still {{competing}} in the F3000 series. However, midway through 1992 Hill broke into Grand Prix racing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>driver</b> with the dying Brabham team. The formerly competitive team was in serious financial difficulties. Hill started the season only after three races, replacing Giovanna Amati after her sponsorship had failed to materialise. Amati {{had been unable to}} get the car through qualifying but Hill matched his team-mate, Eric van de Poele, by qualifying for two races, the mid-season British and Hungarian Grands Prix. Hill continued to test for the Williams team that year and the British Grand Prix saw Nigel Mansell win the race for Williams, while he finished last in the Brabham. The Brabham team collapsed after the Hungarian Grand Prix and did not complete the season.|$|E

5|$|Holden {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force on 26 May 1915, and was posted to the 4th Light Horse Brigade as a private. He {{departed}} for Egypt aboard the transport A29 Suevic on 13 June. Serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>driver</b> first in the Middle East {{and then on the}} Western Front, his mechanical ability and sense of adventure led him to volunteer for the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) in December 1916. After qualifying as a pilot in England, he was commissioned a lieutenant and posted to No.2 Squadron. Commanded by Major Oswald Watt, No.2 Squadron's personnel included many former Lighthorsemen, as well as mechanics from the AFC's first combat formation, the Mesopotamian Half Flight. The force trained extensively in England commencing in January 1917, before deploying to the Western Front that September. Holden was involved in the AFC's first day of combat in France; just after noon on 2 October, in the vicinity of Saint-Quentin, he and his wingman engaged a German two-seater that managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|In humans, {{cells with}} location-specific firing {{patterns}} {{have been reported}} during a study of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. They were undergoing an invasive procedure to localize {{the source of their}} seizures, with a view to surgical resection. The patients had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their hippocampus and then used a computer to move around in a virtual reality town. Similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown the hippocampus to be active. A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London’s black cab drivers need to learn the locations {{of a large number of}} places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of the hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that a positive correlation exists between the length of time served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>driver</b> and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the hippocampus was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the chairman, Lord Alexander of Weedon, {{announced}} a merger with Legal & General {{in a friendly}} £10.7billion deal, the first between a bank and an insurance company in UK history. The move was poorly received in the London financial markets and NatWest's share price fell substantially. Seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>driver</b> of the ill-advised investment banking expansion, Derek Wanless {{was forced to resign}} as chief executive following the appointment of Sir David Rowland (who became executive chairman). Also in 1999, in response to the much reduced NatWest market capitalisation, the much smaller Bank of Scotland made a hostile takeover bid for NatWest. The Bank of Scotland's aim was to break up the NatWest Group and dispose of its non-retail assets. NatWest was forced to abandon its merger, but refused to agree to a takeover by a rival bank. The Royal Bank of Scotland tabled another hostile offer and trumped the Bank of Scotland with a £21billion bid. The takeover of NatWest in early 2000 was the biggest in UK history. National Westminster Bank, once Britain's most profitable bank, was delisted from the London Stock Exchange and became, with its subsidiaries, component parts of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The outcome of this bitter struggle set the tone for a round of consolidation in the financial sector as it prepared for a new age of fierce global competition. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group became the second largest bank in the UK and Europe (after HSBC) and the fifth largest in the world by market capitalisation. According to Forbes Global 2000, it was then the 13th largest company in the world. NatWest was retained as a distinct brand with its own banking licence, but many back office functions were merged with those of the Royal Bank, leading to over 18,000 job losses.|$|E
