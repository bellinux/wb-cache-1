40|$|We discuss {{analytical}} and numerical tools for the statistical {{characterization of the}} anisotropic strain energy density of soft hyperelastic materials embedded with fibers. We consider spatially distributed orientations of fibers following a tridimensional or a planar architecture. We restrict our analysis to material models dependent on the fourth pseudo-invariant I 4 of the Cauchy-Green tensor, and to exponential forms of the fiber strain energy function Ψ aniso. Under different loading conditions, we derive the closed-form expression of the probability density function for I 4 and Ψ aniso. In view of bypassing the cumbersome extension-contraction switch, commonly adopted for shutting down the contribution of contracted fibers in models based on generalized structure tensors, for significant loading conditions we identify analytically {{the support of the}} fibers in pure extension. For uniaxial loadings, the availability of the probability distribution function and the knowledge of the support of the fibers in extension yield to the analytical expression of average and variance of I 4 and Ψ aniso, and to the direct definition of the average second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor. For generalized loadings, the dependence of I 4 on the spatial orientation of the fibers can be analyzed through <b>angle</b> <b>plane</b> diagrams. <b>Angle</b> <b>plane</b> diagrams facilitate the assessment of the influence of the pure extension condition on the definition of the stable support of fibers for the statistics related to the anisotropic strain energy density. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It turns out the comoving TMF pulse increases the wall velocity under the same axial driving field.

40|$|Abstract—A {{modified}} {{genetic algorithm}} (GA) is presented for subsonic wing design using an N-S flow solver with B-L turbulence model. With the feature of revolution in-subsection, the algorithm {{takes advantage of}} binary coding system, and overcomes the large search space problem of requiring continuous sampling. The modified genetic algorithm remarkably improves computational efficiency by coupling with robustness, crossing-over and mutation operators. The resulting optimized subsonic wing has a higher lift-drag ratio than the initial shapes do. By this optimal design method, the algorithm introduced more parameters (twisted angles) for aerodynamic configuration design, and thus demonstrates better of feasibility, robustness, and design outcome for subsonic wing configuration. The resulting outcomes confirm that the method shows quicker in convergence, {{in comparison to the}} traditional genetic algorithms.
