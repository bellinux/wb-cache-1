40|$|NOAA’s Coral Reef Conservation program (CRCP) {{develops}} {{coral reef}} management priorities by bringing together various partners {{to better understand}} threats to coral reef ecosystems {{with the goal of}} conserving, protecting and restoring these resources. Place-based and ecosystem-based management approaches employed by CRCP require that spatially explicit information about benthic habitats and fish utilization are available to characterize coral reef ecosystems and set conservation priorities. To accomplish this, seafloor habitat mapping of coral reefs around the U. S. Virgin Islands (USVI) and Puerto Rico has been ongoing since 2004. In 2008, fishery <b>acoustics</b> <b>surveys</b> were added to NOAA survey missions in the USVI and Puerto Rico to assess fish distribution and abundance in relation to benthic habitats in high priority conservation areas. NOAA’s National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) have developed fisheries <b>acoustics</b> <b>survey</b> capabilities onboard the NOAA ship Nancy Foster to complement the CRCP seafloor habitat mapping effort spearheaded by the Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment Biogeography Branch (CCMA-BB). The integration of these activities has evolved on the Nancy Foster over the three years summarized in this report. A strategy for improved operations and products has emerged over that time. Not only has the concurrent operation of multibeam and fisheries <b>acoustics</b> <b>surveys</b> been beneficial in terms of optimizing ship time and resources, this joint effort has advanced an integrated approach to characterizing bottom and mid-water habitats and the fishes associated with them. CCMA conducts multibeam surveys to systematically map and characterize coral reef ecosystems, resulting in products such as high resolution bathymetric maps, backscatter information, and benthic habitat classification maps. These products focus on benthic features and live bottom habitats associated with them. NCCOS Centers (the Center for Coastal Fisheries and Habitat Research and the Center for Coastal Environmental Health and Biomolecular Research) characterize coral reef ecosystems by using fisheries acoustics methods to capture biological information through the entire water column. Spatially-explicit information on marine resources derived from fisheries <b>acoustics</b> <b>surveys,</b> such as maps of fish density, supports marine spatial planning strategies and decision making by providing a biological metric for evaluating coral reef ecosystems and assessing impacts from pollution, fishing pressure, and climate change. Data from fisheries <b>acoustics</b> <b>surveys</b> address management needs by providing a measure of biomass in management areas, detecting spatial and temporal responses in distribution relative to natural and anthropogenic impacts, and identifying hotspots that support high fish abundance or fish aggregations. Fisheries <b>acoustics</b> <b>surveys</b> conducted alongside multibeam mapping efforts inherently couple water column data with information on benthic habitats and provide information on the heterogeneity of both benthic habitats and biota in the water column. Building on this information serves to inform resource managers regarding how fishes are organized around habitat structure and the scale at which these relationships are important. Where resource managers require place-based assessments regarding the location of critical habitats along with high abundances of fish, concurrent multibeam and fisheries <b>acoustics</b> <b>surveys</b> serve as an important tool for characterizing and prioritizing coral reef ecosystems. This report summarizes the evolution of fisheries <b>acoustics</b> <b>surveys</b> onboard the NOAA ship Nancy Foster from 2008 to 2010, in conjunction with multibeam data collection, aimed at characterizing benthic and mid-water habitats in high priority conservation areas around the USVI and Puerto Rico. It also serves as a resource for the continued development of consistent data products derived from <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys.</b> By focusing on the activities of 2010, this report highlights the progress made to date and illustrates the potential application of fisheries data derived from <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> to the management of coral reef ecosystems...|$|R

Comparison between survey estimates in previous years and the back calculated figures from the VPA showed rather good agreement for age groups 5 - 7. The younger age groups were underestimated by the surveys whilc the older fish appeared to be overestimated. The underestimation of the young (small) fish is explained by lower availability, but the overestimation of the old cod is unexplained.

40|$|Diurnal {{fluctuations}} in total integrated echo abundance and in vertical density profiles were examined {{using data from}} the Norwegian combined <b>acoustic</b> and bottom-trawl <b>survey</b> for demersal fish during winter in the Barents Sea. The total echo abundance was about 40 %– 50 % higher at day than at night. An unknown amount of fish was lost close to the seabed in the acoustic dead zone, but the systematic changes in the near-bottom vertical density profiles did not indicate that migration {{in and out of the}} dead zone was the major reason for the large diurnal differences in echo abundance. A more plausible explanation could be that diurnal changes in fish behaviour affect the mean acoustic target strength. Based on the present study, we recommend that the time series of <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> should be reanalysed, taking the diurnal bias into account. Any comparison of the fish densities indicated by trawl and <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> will suffer if this bias is not corrected.

40|$|Abstract The diurnal {{cycle in}} density {{measured}} during <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> {{is difficult to}} investigate quantitatively from the data set of a single survey because the signal depends mainly on the spatial variability andlor horizontal fish migrations.

A diurnal cycle is observed, with the highest values during the night and the lowest during the day. The transition periods are very short (less than one hour). Different hypotheses relative to fish behaviour or to acoustic biases are discussed. Among these hypotheses the lateral avoidance of schools by day and the diumal change in patchiness seem predominant.

40|$|Indices of {{abundance}} for capelin in the Newfoundland area collected {{since the early}} 1980 s include biomass estimates from offshore <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys,</b> school surface area near spawning beaches from aerial surveys, and catch rates from the inshore commercial fishery. During the 1990 s, the offshore acoustic estimates declined dramatically but the inshore in-dices remained stable. This divergence was coincident with below nor-mal water temperatures and changes in capelin biology.

The dichotomy in the trends {{of abundance}} indices has never been fully reconciled. However, based on data from several sources, it appears that the <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> were underestimating the true population abundance of capelin offshore.

Walleye pollock density distributions were also compared {{with those in the}} five nearest daytime survey transects. We found that horizontal density distributions did not change at temporal scales ≤ 4 h and that spatial vari-ance remained consistent at scales ≤ 2. 5 km. Spatial variance density patterns were similar in transects sampled during the day compared with those sampled at night and were also similar in along-shore compared with cross-shore transects. Transects that contained two biological scattering layers could be vertically separated into zooplankton and fish. Spatial variance patterns in the upper zooplankton layer mimicked those of passive tracers, while patterns in the lower layer were consistent with those previously observed for mobile nekton.
