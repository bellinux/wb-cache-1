30|$|The {{results showed}} that in all 21 {{augmented}} sites, a significant ridge augmentation was achieved, with a mean vertical <b>augmentation</b> <b>of</b> 6.5  ±  1.7  mm and a mean horizontal <b>augmentation</b> <b>of</b> 5.5  ±  1.9  mm. To our best knowledge, {{this is the first}} study investigating these parameters in individualized CAD-CAM-produced titanium meshes. For conventional titanium meshes, several studies were published. Torres et al. investigated the effectiveness of anorganic bovine bone in alveolar bone augmentation with the titanium mesh technique [32]. The average bone height gained was 3.3  ±  0.2  mm and the average bone width 3.9  ±  0.2  mm. Corinaldesi et al. indicated in 24 patients with 27 micromeshes a mean vertical bone <b>augmentation</b> <b>of</b> 5.4  ±  1.81  mm [23]. Pieri et al. examined the clinical and radiographic parameters of implants placed in augmented ridges using a 70 : 30 mixture of autogenous bone and bovine bone mineral in association with titanium meshes [21]. Radiographic assessment showed a mean vertical <b>augmentation</b> <b>of</b> 3.71  ±  1.24  mm and mean horizontal <b>augmentation</b> <b>of</b> 4.16  ±  0.59  mm. Proussaefs and Lozada applied a titanium mesh for localized alveolar ridge augmentation with an equal mixture of autogenous bone and bovine bone mineral [22]. Radiographic evaluation indicated a mean vertical ridge <b>augmentation</b> <b>of</b> 2.56  ±  1.32  mm and a mean horizontal ridge <b>augmentation</b> <b>of</b> 3.75  ±  1.33. In total, the mesh technique is a predictable procedure with sufficient horizontal and vertical bone gain.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Sensory neurons in the {{dorsal root}} {{ganglion}} express two kinds of tetrodotoxin resistant (TTX-R) isoforms of voltage-gated sodium channels, NaV 1. 8 and NaV 1. 9. These isoforms play key roles in the pathophysiology of chronic pain. Of special interest is NaV 1. 9 : our previous studies revealed a unique property of the NaV 1. 9 current, i. e., the NaV 1. 9 current shows a gradual and notable up-regulation of the peak amplitude during recording (“spontaneous <b>augmentation</b> <b>of</b> NaV 1. 9 ”). However, the mechanism underlying the spontaneous <b>augmentation</b> <b>of</b> NaV 1. 9 is still unclear. In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} protein kinases A and C (PKA and PKC), on the spontaneous <b>augmentation</b> <b>of</b> NaV 1. 9. The spontaneous <b>augmentation</b> <b>of</b> the NaV 1. 9 current was significantly suppressed by activation of PKA, whereas activation of PKA did not affect the voltage dependence of inactivation for the NaV 1. 9 current. On the contrary, the finding that activation of PKC can affect the voltage dependence of inactivation for NaV 1. 9 in the perforated patch recordings, where the augmentation does not occur, suggests that the effects of PMA are independent <b>of</b> the <b>augmentation</b> process. These results indicate that the spontaneous <b>augmentation</b> <b>of</b> NaV 1. 9 was regulated directly by PKA, and indirectly by PKC...|$|R

The theme identified was how midwives managed to ‘navigate’ these factors, which provided midwives with a decisive influence during the decision-making process. Key conclusions and implications midwife job satisfaction can result {{from a sense of}} professional power over the possibility of navigating factors that influence decision-making during <b>augmentation</b> <b>of</b> labour.
