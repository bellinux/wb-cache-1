The two-dimensional steady differential equations for conservation of mass and momentum are solved for the Reynolds number (Re) ranging from 50 to 350, the expansion length (Lexp) ranging from 1 to 20 and aspect ratio (AR) of 2. The effect of Reynolds number and expansion length on <b>average</b> static <b>pressure,</b> <b>average</b> stagnation <b>pressure</b> drop, wall pressure and pattern of velocity distribution has been studied in detail. From the study, it is revealed that all the above investigated parameters except <b>average</b> stagnation <b>pressure</b> drop are increased with increase in Reynolds number.

30|$|One of the {{significant}} parameters which {{play a vital role}} in the permeability measurements is external borders pressure. External reservoir borders at different depths have various pressures. It obtains the more appropriate quantities which they matched with core analysis, and the <b>average</b> <b>pressure</b> is assumed in the calculations. The accurate and efficient way to measure <b>average</b> <b>pressure</b> is selecting inflow performance (henceforth; SIP). Also, <b>average</b> <b>pressure</b> has an adverse effect on the permeability, and by increasing <b>average</b> <b>pressure,</b> permeability would decrease. Due to the results of SIP, it is evident that when the productivity index (PI) is very low, the PLT is not preferable for permeability measurements and core analysis would be the best choice. The second significant parameter is the bottom hole pressure, which exercises a dominant influence on the permeability; to dramatically increase the permeability by raising the bottom hole pressure. Hence, this parameter should be taken into account throughout the logging procedures, and its changes should be recorded accurately. The other parameters such as fluid properties (e.g., viscosity, oil formation volume factor, etc.) except pressure gradient and fluid velocity have less impact on the permeability measurements and should be negligible.|$|R

We have found that the intrinsic phase-volume <b>average</b> <b>pressure</b> results in a gradient in the total phase potential, i. e., the above criterion is violated. In fact, only the centroid-corrected operator satisfies this criterion. However, at high saturations, use of the centroid-corrected average can give rise to negative values of the difference between the average nonwetting and wetting phase pressures. For main drainage, differences among various averaging operators are significantly less because both phases are present initially, such that the difference between the centroids of phases, and the middle of the domain are relatively small.
