25|$|Stiglitz made early {{contributions}} to {{a theory of}} public finance stating that an optimal supply of local public goods can be funded entirely through capture of the land rents generated by those goods (when population distributions are optimal). Stiglitz dubbed this the 'Henry George theorem' {{in reference to the}} radical classical economist Henry George who famously advocated for land value tax. The explanation behind Stiglitz's finding is that rivalry for public goods takes place geographically, so competition for access to any beneficial public good will increase land values by <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> its outlay cost. Furthermore, Stiglitz shows that a single tax on rents is necessary to provide the optimal supply of local public investment. Stiglitz also shows how the theorem could be used to find the optimal size of a city or firm.|$|E

25|$|For the {{two years}} {{following}} his graduation from college he studied law at Yale, at Harvard, and in his father's office. In 1863 he {{was admitted to the}} bar and began the practice of law. His seventeen years of service as an associate justice and chief justice of the supreme court of his state and his four years as governor, coming {{as they did in the}} latter part of his life, may have had a tendency to obscure for his later contemporaries the fact that he was <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> anything else an eminently successful lawyer. In the practice of the law he won distinction both in his own state and outside, and with it the financial emoluments that usually accompany success at the bar. He was keenly alive to the practical side of the lawyer's work and never lost his zest for it. Till almost the very end of his life he maintained a law office, which he visited daily as long as his health would permit, and kept adding to his law library. As late as 1919 his book The Young Man and the Law revealed him still at heart a lawyer. In 1878, he was one of the founders of the American Bar Association and served as President of the American Bar Association from 1890-1891. For twelve years (1907–1919) he was the director of the American Bar Association's Comparative Law Bureau (as well as its Annual Bulletins editor for general jurisprudence).|$|E
