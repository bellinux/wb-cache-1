5|$|Helene Bresslau Schweitzer {{was born}} to the Bresslau family on January 25, 1879 in Berlin.

5|$|In {{efficiency}} wage models, {{workers are}} paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market. For example, in developing countries, firms might {{pay more than}} a market rate to ensure their workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive. Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale, possibly leading to better productivity. Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking. Shirking models were particularly influential. Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz (1984) created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking employees with unemployment. If the economy is at full employment, a fired shirker simply moves to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>job.</b> Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market rate to ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having to move to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>job.</b> Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages, the aggregated labor market fails to clear. This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired. Workers not only risk a lower wage, they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed. Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed.|$|E

He was linked with the managerial vacancy at League Two Peterborough United, but eventually took over as manager of Stevenage Borough on 28 May, and led the club to an eighth-place finish in the Conference National in his first season in charge. Stevenage also defeated Stimson's former club Grays to reach the FA Trophy final, and beat Kidderminster Harriers 3–2 at the new Wembley Stadium in the final, giving Stimson a third consecutive Trophy win as a manager.|$|E
