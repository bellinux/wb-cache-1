5|$|By {{the time}} Musidora was exhibited, Etty's health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, {{it was not}} unusual for passers-by to accuse him of {{drunkenness}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> wheezing through the London streets, and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E
5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on {{despite the fact that}} it was signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the timer's bench. As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the ice to the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E
5|$|Though ancient {{rules of}} {{hospitality}} had protected the expedition, {{they knew that}} once {{they were out of}} the Emir's lands, the Anglo-Russian forces as well as the marauding tribesmen of Persia would chase them mercilessly. The party split up into several groups, each independently making its way back to Germany. Niedermayer headed west, attempting to run the Anglo-Russian Cordon and escape through Persia, while von Hentig made for the route over the Pamir Mountains towards Chinese Central Asia. Having served in Peking before the war, von Hentig was familiar with the region and planned to make Yarkand a base from which to make a last attempt to create local Muslim unrest against Anglo-Russian interests in the region. He later escaped over the Hindu Kush, avoiding his pursuers for 130 days <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> on foot and horseback through Chinese Turkestan, over the Gobi Desert, and through China and Shanghai. From there, he stowed away on an American vessel to Honolulu. Following the American declaration of war, he was exchanged as a diplomat. Travelling via San Francisco, Halifax, and Bergen, he finally reached Berlin on 9 June 1917. Meanwhile, Niedermayer escaped towards Persia through Russian Turkestan. Robbed and left for dead, a wounded Niedermayer was at times reduced to begging before he finally reached friendly lines, arriving in Tehran on 20 July 1916. Wagner left Herat on 25 October 1917, making his way through northern Persia to reach Turkey on 30 January 1918. At Chorasan, he tried to rally Persian democratic and nationalist leaders, who promised to raise an army of 12,000 if Germany provided military assistance.|$|E

5|$|John Cena and Chris Jericho were {{involved}} in the main rivalry on the Raw brand over the World Heavyweight Championship. At WWE's November Survivor Series, Cena returned to the WWE after a legitimate neck injury (that he sustained at SummerSlam) and defeated Jericho to win the championship. On the November 24 episode of Raw, Jericho defeated Randy Orton and Batista in a Triple Threat match to earn a title match against Cena at Armageddon. Later that night, Chris Jericho attempted to steal Cena's thunder, claiming that he plans on winning back the title at Armageddon. When World Champion, John Cena could even make his much anticipated return to Raw, he then gave Jericho an opportunity to confront him face-to-face, Cena explained the difference between himself and Jericho, stating that he actually cares about the many members of the WWE Universe. After Jericho once again stated his intention to beat Cena at Armageddon and continued to belittle the WWE Universe, Cena snapped. He proceeded to brutalize Jericho, throwing him against the announce table, bludgeoning him with the steel stairs and locking him into an STFU. On the following week's episode of Raw, Jericho made his presence known {{in much the same way}} as Cena did the week before, addressing the audience <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> through the crowd down to the ring. The difference however, was that while Cena welcomed his fans, Jericho made pains to ignore them. He then went on to explain his resentment toward Cena, stating that while away from the WWE since August 2005, Jericho's son grew to be a fan, not of his father, but of John Cena. Now, Jericho hopes to show his son and all of the WWE what a real hero is, by beating Cena for the World Heavyweight Title at Armageddon. Later that night, Cena fought Kane in Raw's main event. Though Jericho attempted to become involved, Cena managed to fight off and then go on to defeat Kane. After the match, Cena chased Jericho, who was attempting to escape. The tables turned, however, when Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Manu emerged to attack Cena, allowing Jericho to lock Cena in the Walls of Jericho.|$|E

25|$|In the 12th {{inning of}} Game 6 of the 1975 World Series at Fenway Park, Fisk hit a pitch off of Cincinnati Reds pitcher Pat Darcy {{that went down}} the left field line and {{appeared}} to be heading into foul territory.

25|$|The late 13th-century {{was a time}} of {{profound}} upheaval for Scotland. On 19 March 1286, King Alexander III died after being thrown from his horse <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to Kinghorn, in Fife, from Edinburgh Castle to be with his young Flemish queen, Yolande. Although the king had previously been married to Joan, an English princess and sister of the future King Edward I, his children from that marriage had predeceased him. At the time of the king's death, there was no issue from his latest marriage. In the aftermath of Alexander’s death, the Crown passed to his three-year-old granddaughter, Margaret, Maid of Norway. The child-queen was never enthroned, dying during the sea-passage to Scotland.|$|E

25|$|The {{match between}} Kent Spitfires and Somerset Sabres at St Lawrence Ground was {{shortened}} to 16 overs owing to bad weather. Kent were sent in to bat, and lost three early wickets, two to Andy Caddick {{and one to}} Richard Johnson, for only 11 runs. Robert Key and Justin Kemp both made 17, and James Tredwell smacked two sixes for his nine-ball 22 as Kent came back to 90 for 6, which was still below six runs an over. Tredwell also took two for 19 with his off breaks, but Graeme Smith hit nine fours <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to an unbeaten 56, and James Hildreth won the match for Somerset with a six off Tredwell, with 20 balls potentially remaining in their chase.|$|E
25|$|Ganteaume had got his fleet {{ready for}} sea by 24 March, but Brest was being closely {{blockaded}} by Vice-Admiral Cotton's 17 ships of the line. Ganteaume had orders to avoid battle, {{and waited until}} conditions seemed favourable on 26 March, when a fog came down that would help him to slip past the British. But <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> out the weather changed suddenly, blowing away the fog and {{making it difficult to}} return to the anchorage. Temporarily trapped outside the port Ganteaume reluctantly prepared for battle as Cotton's force approached. Cotton did not however risk an engagement with night closing, many shoals and with the enemy fleet under the guns of French shore batteries, and chose to merely observe and blockade Ganteaume. The following day the wind changed, allowing Ganteaume to return to port, where he {{spent the rest of the}} campaign.|$|E
25|$|Surrey captain John Edrich won the toss {{and decided}} to bat first. Openers Edrich, and Alan Butcher {{got off to a}} solid start, taking them to 48 for the first wicket. Their {{partnership}} was broken when Butcher was caught behind by Rod Marsh off the bowling of Len Pascoe for 23. Lonsdale Skinner contributed 17, but then Edrich was joined by Pakistan Test batsman Younis Ahmed, and the pair added 66 for the third wicket. Their stand was broken by the medium bowling of Max Walker who had Ahmed caught by Kim Hughes for 40, and dismissed Edrich caught behind for 70 soon after. Walker then dismissed David Smith for a duck, and at 165 for 5 the tourists were in a commanding position. New batsman Graham Roope had other ideas though, and was in commanding form. He formed lower order partnerships with Intikhab Alam (16), Robin Jackman (16), and Geoff Arnold (11) who all supported him ably <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to 107 not out, guiding Surrey to a respectable 327 for 8. Not {{for the first time in}} the match, play was abandoned early on the second day due to rain, and no play occurred on the third day, with the match ending in a draw.|$|E

On the June 20 episode of Raw, during the storyline wedding of Edge and Lita, Hardy's entrance music and video were played when the priest asked if anyone had a reason why Edge and Lita should not be wed. On the July 11 episode of Raw, Hardy made his return, attacking Edge <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the ring. On the July 13 episode of WWE's webcast Byte This!, which featured Lita as its guest, one of the callers was Hardy himself.|$|E
