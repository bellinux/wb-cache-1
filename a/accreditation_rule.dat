5000|$|Suit {{filed against}} the American Bar Association (ABA) on behalf of legally blind school {{applicant}} Angelo Binno, a resident of West Bloomfield, Michigan in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division. The complaint alleges that by pushing law schools to use the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) in its <b>accreditation</b> <b>rules,</b> the ABA imposes an inequitable test requiring [...] "spatial reasoning {{and the ability to}} diagram" [...] that discriminates against blind and visually impaired students. The suit alleges that the ABA is thereby failing to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.|$|R
5000|$|During the 2015 European Games Azerbaijani channel Lider TV {{interviewed a}} local man who posed as a {{foreigner}} {{in order to}} create a [...] "provocation". After Meydan TV identified the interviewee as Seymur Seferov, a displaced Azerbaijani citizen from the Jabrayil Rayon, the Lider TV report on purported foreigner went viral in Azerbaijani social media. In 2015 it was reported that several Meydan TV journalists were prosecuted, arrested or received travel bans (including Aynura Ismayil, Shirin Abbasov, Ayten Farhadova and Aysel Umudova). According to Ali Hasanov, Meydan TV website and several other media outlets were not following the <b>accreditation</b> <b>rules</b> for foreign media representatives in Azerbaijan approved on 18 March 2015.|$|R
40|$|Information Systems {{programs}} in Business Colleges are often constrained {{in the number}} of classes they can offer majors by both university and <b>accreditation</b> <b>rules.</b> Some programs attempt to get around these constraints by combining things like application and web page development tools and techniques in a single class with broader system development and project management concepts. While this may work in a semester based system, it can severely push the limits of what is possible for quarter based programs. This paper describes the evolution and current, or near future, state of one possible solution to this problem, the use of Microsoft’s ASP as a development tool. The paper focuses on features in the forthcoming ASP. NET 2. 0 and Visual Studio 2005 that simplify the development/programming environment while permitting students to create more sophisticated, more robust applications in less time than was previously possible. The time saved on development efforts can provide students with more time for requirements analysis, risk assessment, testing, documentation, project management and other aspects of the full development cycle...|$|R
50|$|Like United States and Canada, {{there is}} no central {{authority}} for <b>accreditation</b> as <b>rules</b> and regulations in many Caribbean countries differ greatly. CAAM-HP is a local accreditation body, while ACCM is invited by some countries to accredit on their behalf. Although a US state board accreditation is not necessary for {{students to participate in}} residency matching, some school seek such accreditation as it is required for attractive residency destinations such as California or New York.|$|R
40|$|All lawyers 2 ̆ 7 {{codes of}} {{professional}} ethics in the United States expect {{members of the}} bar to perform legal services for low-income persons. In practice, as we all know, many lawyers perform {{a great deal of}} such service while others do little or none. By much the same token, the <b>accreditation</b> <b>rules</b> of the American Bar Association urge all law schools to provide students with opportunities to do pro bono legal work; by much the same token, some schools in the United States have extensive programs for their students but many do not. In 1998, the Association of American Law Schools created a Commission on Pro Bono and Public Service Opportunities to help law schools improve their pro bono programs. The Commission began its work by reviewing available research and by surveying all law schools to learn the current extent of pro bono services by law students. The Commission learned that nearly all law schools offer clinical programs through which students can eam credit for providing legal services to low-income clients, but that schools were much more varying in {{the extent to which they}} gave students the opportunity to provide voluntary services without credit...|$|R

40|$|Capacity {{building}} in rural and remote areas is {{hampered by the}} lack of availability of trained supervisors for clinical psychology and other mental health students in rural and remote locations. Difficulties also exist with the current mental health workforce who are qualified to practice yet are unable to access a supervisor to provide the support required to deal with often complex and clinically challenging mental health issues. Training {{to improve the quality of}} supervision and the number of appropriately trained supervisors has the potential to reduce burnout and declining retention rates. The Codes and guidelines paper issued by the Psychology Board of Australia indicated that, under the National <b>Accreditation</b> <b>rules</b> which took effect in July 2010, there will be an increased emphasis on student supervision. More flexible rules will allow increased use of distance methods including teleconference quality video to assist training for those in remote settings. Notably, supervision will now be required for all practising psychologists, no longer just for students, thus the demand for supervision training is expected to increase significantly. For the Mental Health Nursing profession, participation in clinical supervision is an essential requirement for completion of the Credentialing process, as specified by the Australian College of Mental Health Nurses, and is regarded as a benchmark to maintain standards of practice. Work to date has included the development of a self-directed supported training syllabus to prepare mental health professionals for the role of clinical student supervision. Aspect of this work and an outline of research plans are described...|$|R
50|$|Together {{with the}} Canadian Medical Association (CMA), the AFMC carries out <b>accreditation</b> surveys and <b>rules</b> on the <b>accreditation</b> status {{of all of}} the {{undergraduate}} medical programs in Canada, as well as all university-based continuing medical education. The Liaison Committee on Medical Education, jointly administered by the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association, also accredits Canadian medical schools. The M.D. and M.D.C.M medical degrees are the only medical degrees offered in Canada listed in the WHO/IMED list of medical schools.|$|R
5000|$|In general, {{the names}} of U.S. {{post-secondary}} institutions and their degree titles do not indicate whether the institution is accredited or the type of <b>accreditation</b> it holds. <b>Rules</b> on this topic {{vary from state to}} state. For example, Tennessee Higher Education Commission regulations require that post-secondary institutions in the state of Tennessee must be regionally accredited to use the word [...] "university" [...] in their names, and that a school lacking regional accreditation may not use the word [...] "college" [...] in its name without adding a qualifier such as [...] "career", [...] "vocational", [...] "business", [...] "technical", [...] "art", [...] "Bible", or [...] "Christian". Tennessee rules also specify that only regionally accredited schools can issue [...] "liberal arts" [...] degrees or degree titles such as Associate of Arts or Science and Bachelor of Arts or Science.|$|R
40|$|This article {{makes the}} case for the value – and the feasibility, under current <b>accreditation</b> and related <b>rules</b> {{governing}} law schools - of a clinical rotation for law students, modeled on the rotations that are a key part of medical school education. The “clinical year,” which would engage students in almost full-time practice/study for their third year of law school, could be a significant step in building the complete apprenticeship that the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has urged. It would also rely to a large extent on the supervision, and teaching, that adjunct law school faculty – supervisors at the rotation settings – would provide. In that respect, the “clinical year” differs from in-house clinical education. The article addresses the differences in students’ experience that this approach to bridging the gap between theory and practice would generate, and argues that this model is worth exploring, despite – and in some respects because of – these features...|$|R
40|$|The {{intricacies of}} {{international}} land-use change and forestry policy reflect the temporal, technical and political difficulty of integrating biological systems {{and climate change}} mitigation. The plethora of co-existing policies with varied technical <b>rules,</b> <b>accreditation</b> requirements, accounting methods, market registries, etc., disguise the unequal efficacies of each mechanism. This work explores the co-evolution and convergence of Australian voluntary and mandatory climate-related policies at the biosequestration-bioenergy interface. Currently, there are temporal differences between the fast-evolving and precise climate-change mechanisms, and the long-term 'permanence' sought from land use changes encouraged by biosequestration instruments. Policy convergence that favours the most efficient, appropriate and scientifically substantiated policy mechanisms is required. These policies must recognise the fundamental biological foundation of biosequestration, bioenergy, biomaterial industrial development and other areas such as food security and environmental concerns. Policy mechanisms that provide administrative simplicity, project longevity and market certainty are necessary for rural and regional Australians to cost-effectively harness the considerable climate change mitigation potential of biological systems...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the recent reforms of Italian National {{services}} (SSN), focusing on opportunities for a development of complementary health funds. We {{have seen how}} the development of complementary health fund schemes could represent a chance to bypass financing problem deriving from the limits in the public budget. At the same time, we must observe that, up to now, full growth of the sector didn't occurred. We have gone deeper {{in the analysis of}} the new regulation, arguing that lack of specific set of <b>rules,</b> <b>accreditation</b> of the delivering firms, federalism, and some other technical short comings deriving from the coexistence by Italian law of two typoligies of funds ("doc" and "non doc") could explain the weak development of the sector. Furthermore, the compulsory integrative nature of the funds could not fully meet the houseold needs. In conclusion, we belive that some useless inflexibility in the regulations should be remuved; besides this, we suggest that deeper analysis of demand for health insurance should becam the first issue in the agenda of the health policy makers...|$|R
