40|$|Abstract. SDAMS is the {{ensemble}} of database + software packages aimed to the archiving, quick-look analysis, off-line analysis, network accessibility and plotting of the SPOrt produced data. Many of the aspects related to data archiving, analysis and distribution {{are common to}} almost all the astronomical experiments. SDAMS ambition is to face and solve problems like accessibility and portability of the data on any hardware/software platform in a way <b>as</b> <b>simpler</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> though effective. The system is conceived {{in a way to}} be used either by the scientific community interested in background radiation studies or by a wider public with low or null knowledge of the subject. The user authentication system allows us to apply different levels of access, analysis and data retrieving. SDAMS will be accessible through any Web browser though {{the most efficient way to}} use it is by writing simple programs. Graphics and images useful for outreach purposes will be produced and put on the Web on a regular basis...|$|R

25|$|It is {{important}} that edges have shapes that are <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> {{to make it easier}} for the eye to follow them. In polyline drawings, the complexity of an edge may be measured by its number of bends, and many methods aim to provide drawings with few total bends or few bends per edge. Similarly for spline curves the complexity of an edge may be measured by the number of control points on the edge.|$|E
25|$|This {{ship was}} {{conceived}} {{as an intermediate}} step between the expensive fleet carriers and the limited-capability escort carriers. The design had to be <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> so construction time was {{kept to a minimum}} and so more shipyards (particularly those with no naval construction experience) could be used. However, the ships had to be capable of operating in fleet actions. Originally designated the 'Intermediate Aircraft Carrier', the ships were reclassified as 'Light Fleet Carriers'. Because naval design staff were overworked, the carrier was primarily designed by shipbuilders at Vickers-Armstrong.|$|E
25|$|The VP-1 was {{designed}} specifically to utilize a modified VW Type 1 automotive engine from the VW Beetle. The fuselage is built in a warren truss arrangement where the exterior plywood takes the diagonal stress loads, therefore eliminating the diagonal members to maintain simplicity. The vertical and upright members are staggered to keep the joints <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> The wing is of a forward and aft blank spar design which uses stack-cut plywood ribs of equal size {{in order to keep}} construction time down. The ailerons are hinged directly behind the aft spar. For simplicity no flaps are provided. The wings and tail surfaces are fabric covered.|$|E

40|$|Today, it is {{impractical}} work modelling {{the dynamics}} of failure, given the high complexity of the systems involved. As soon, {{it is important to}} identify models, <b>as</b> <b>simples</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> with qualitatively similar to the failures. The first model introducing is it the mechanical block-spring model, given by Burrigde-Knopoff [1]. In this work the subject was treated by experimental means. For that purpose it was developed and designed a mechanical system similar it that used in the numerical modulations, the so called earthquake machine (shown in Figure 1). We have equipped the springs of the machine with a set of force sensors connected to a data acquisition system (DAQ), linked in turn to a computer. The data recorded in the mechanical prototype consists of temporal series of tensions measured by the sensors that correspond to the sequence of tension accumulation and drop taking place in the springs. Data processing followed two distinct methodologies. The first treated the data according to the techniques used in seismology with field measurements. In the second methodology, we tried to use the series recorded in the context of chaos theories to investigate the behaviour of prototype...|$|R
40|$|E-voting systems – the {{combination}} of vote-casting, ballot transmission and counting, auditing and monitoring systems – have been gaining much attention {{from the international community}} as a suitable solution for preventing errors issued from human reliability on vote counting. Whilst many reports have said about currently available pilots and proposals are sensible, some fundamental issues remain unresolved such as {{the fact that most of}} systems are unverifiable by voters, candidates and returning officers. In most proposals, votes disappear into the machine so that it is impossible to audit votes without removing the secrecy of votes. In more recent years, an electronic voting system called Prêt à Voter has been developed to allow verification of individual casts and audit elections. Prêt à Voter combines paper trail for recounts and a sophisticated cryptography mechanism to ensure secrecy of votes and vote verification. However, as any other e-voting system, the user adoption and the user acceptance of Prêt à Voter not only depend on how technically sound the system is but also how voters perceive the system as trusted. Despite the fact Prêt à Voter has been designed to make the voting process <b>as</b> <b>simpler</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> the introduction of onlin...|$|R
25|$|After {{designing}} the un-built Ro I twin-engined flying boat, Rohrbach developed the Rohrbach Ro II flying boat as an all-metal shoulder winged monoplane flying boat with two tractor engines mounted in nacelles, above the wings, on struts. Planforms and profiles were kept <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> with rectangular section fuselage frames (with vee planing bottoms), constant chord wings, tailplane and fin with square cut tips and distinctive protruding servo/trim/balance tabs at wing and fin tips. The two-seat open cockpit sat between the engines at the wing leading edge, {{with an open}} gunner/bosun's position at the extreme nose. A very unusual feature of several of Rohrbach's flying-boats was the provision {{of a pair of}} masts and sails to be rigged in the event of engine failure to allow the aircraft to be sailed back to safety.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{laboratory}} did not employ any revolutionary measurement techniques, it was unique {{because of the}} simple logistics of constructing such a demonstration within a limited space and have it quickly and efficiently be able to gather all the necessary data. The laboratory itself was a see-through (lattice-walled) fenced off gallery measuring 36 feet long by 6 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton {{had to make the}} process <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> for people to understand. As a result, subjects were taken through {{the laboratory}} in pairs so that explanations could be given to two at a time, also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative to go through all the tests first, encouraging the other. With this design, the total time spent in the exhibit was fourteen minutes for each pair.|$|E
25|$|The work of Lorentz was mathematically perfected by Henri Poincaré who {{formulated}} on {{many occasions}} the Principle of Relativity and tried to harmonize it with electrodynamics. He declared simultaneity only a convenient convention which depends on the speed of light, whereby the constancy {{of the speed of}} light would be a useful postulate for making the laws of nature <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> In 1900 and 1904 he physically interpreted Lorentz's local time as the result of clock synchronization by light signals. And finally in June and July 1905 he declared the relativity principle a general law of nature, including gravitation. He corrected some mistakes of Lorentz and proved the Lorentz covariance of the electromagnetic equations. However, he used the notion of an aether as a perfectly undetectable medium and distinguished between apparent and real time, so most historians of science argue that he failed to invent special relativity.|$|E

[...] "Hollywood" [...] is a dance-pop and folk rock song that lyrically discusses American culture and greed, focusing on Hollywood, California, {{as a place of}} pop stars and illusory dreams. Madonna's vocals in the song was noted as that of a little-girl's; during the song she also raps, with the repeated phrase [...] "Push the button".

500|$|Changeling was {{director}} of photography Tom Stern's sixth film with Eastwood. Despite the muted palette, the film is more colorful than some previous Stern–Eastwood collaborations. Stern referenced a large book of period images.

Stern said the challenge was to make Changeling <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> to shoot. To focus more on Jolie's performance, he tended to avoid the use of fill lighting. Eastwood did not want the flashbacks to Northcott's ranch to be too much like a horror film—he said the focus of the scene was the effect of the crimes on Sanford Clark—so he avoided graphic imagery in favor of casting the murders in shadow.|$|E

Feeling disillusioned by the heavy detuned rock popular in the Seattle grunge scene upon which Sub Pop had built its image, Cobain—inspired by his contemporary listening habits—began writing songs that were more melodic. A key development was the single [...] "Sliver", released on Sub Pop in 1990 (before Grohl joined the band), which Cobain said [...] "was like a statement in a way. I had to write a pop song and release it on a single to prepare people for the next record. I wanted to write more songs like that."

Thus Washington, D.C. as depicted in the movie keeps well-known buildings such as the Capitol and the Washington Monument, {{as well as a}} section of modern buildings {{on the other side of}} the Potomac River. Production designer Alex McDowell was hired based on his work in Fight Club and his storyboards for a film version of Fahrenheit 451 which would have starred Mel Gibson.

The new environment had a productive effect on the writing process as the band wrote enough for a double album, but they discarded one hour's worth of songs that sounded too similar to their past albums. Banks said a conscious {{effort was made to}} keep melodies <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> which signalled further changes in their direction.
