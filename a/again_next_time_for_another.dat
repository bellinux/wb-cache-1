40|$|A test {{aiming to}} measure calves' {{responses}} to humans ("approach test") {{was conducted in}} two steps: during the first step (approach phase) the calves' reaction to the appearance of an unknown person (withdrawal or not) was observed during milk provision, during the second step (touch phase) the calves' reaction to the outstretching of the arm and touching on the head was measured qualitatively {{on a scale from}} I (no withdrawal) to 4 (strong withdrawal). The repeatability of the withdrawal test was determined by performing the test twice with a 2 -day interval on 150 calves. The reliability of the test was determined by comparing the responses of 22 calves to the approach test with their behaviour to humans during a longer test in an arena. For the approach phase, a high consistency was found between repetitions: calves that withdrew from the unknown person during the first observation, withdrew <b>again</b> the <b>next</b> <b>time.</b> <b>For</b> the touch phase, calves with either score I or 4 had the same score the following observation. However, responses of score 2 or 3 were not very consistent over time. The scores obtained in both the approach and touch phase of the test were strongly related with the calves' responses to a person in an arena: calves who withdrew from the unknown person at the approach test showed a longer latency to interact, interacted less often and shorter with the unknown person when observed in the arena than did calves who did not withdraw. In conclusion, the approach test can be considered to be repeatable and reliable. Therefore, {{it can be used to}} determine the animal's responsiveness to humans.

50|$|Hydraulic dashpots or hydraulic-action timers {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} and operation to pneumatic timers. Hydraulic-action timers work by energizing the solenoid coil which pulls the hollow core {{into the center of}} the coil. Fluid in the hollow core is then forced to go through an orifice at the top, a one way check valve at the bottom of the hollow core prevents the fluid from escaping through the bottom. After the fluid is expelled, the core completes its upward movement and closes an air gap in the core, which in turn increases its electromagnetic field strength. When the coil becomes de-energized, it releases the core, and fluid is forced back into the hollow area of the core through the check valve, so the fluid is used <b>again</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> the coil is energized. Hydraulic action timers are usually designed <b>for</b> a specific <b>time,</b> which is set in the factory during their manufacture. These timers are also very reliable.|$|R
