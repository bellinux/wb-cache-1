5|$|Thanks to its {{appearance}} in the Orange Bowl and a revenue-sharing agreement with other Big East schools, Virginia Tech earned $3.981 million for playing in the 1996 Orange Bowl. $3.5 million of that total came directly from the bowl, while the remaining $481,000 came from the revenue-sharing pool generated by <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> East teams that participated in bowl games. The almost-$4 million payout made Virginia Tech's football team the wealthiest of the 36 schools that participated in bowl games after the 1996 season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the three}} games {{following}} {{the loss to}} Syracuse, Tech lost two, taking it to a final regular-season record of 9–4 overall and a Big East conference record of 3–4, meaning Tech was the fourth ranked team in the Big East that season. Prior to the season, the Big East had {{signed an agreement with}} the new San Francisco Bowl, giving that bowl the fifth pick of bowl-eligible teams in the Big East. But with the Gator Bowl (second pick of Big East teams) selecting Notre Dame instead of a Big East team, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> East's selections were pushed back one slot. Second-place West Virginia University was pushed to the Continental Tire Bowl (third pick) and third-place Pittsburgh was selected by the Insight Bowl (fourth pick), leaving Virginia Tech to be selected by the San Francisco Bowl with the fifth pick.|$|E

25|$|A {{large scale}} survey of {{residents}} of Great Britain found that average levels of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Five, including conscientiousness, vary across regional districts in England, Wales and Scotland. High levels of conscientiousness were found {{throughout much of}} Southern England, scattered areas of the Midlands, {{and most of the}} Scottish Highlands. Low levels of conscientiousness were observed in London, Wales, and parts of the North of England. Higher mean levels of regional conscientiousness were positively correlated with voting for the Conservative Party, and negatively correlated with voting for the Labour Party, in the 2005 and 2010 elections, and also correlated with a higher proportion of married residents, with higher life expectancy for men and women, fewer long-term health problems, and with lower rates of mortality from stroke, cancer, and heart disease. Higher regional conscientiousness was also correlated with lower median annual income in 2011.|$|E
25|$|The {{club was}} {{purchased}} by Calabrese entrepreneur Aldo Spinelli in 1985 and despite no longer having Simoni as manager, Genoa were finishing in {{the top half of}} Serie B. After a slip in form during 1987–88 (failing to be promoted by a mere point in 1986–87, then having to struggle not to be retroceded the following season, being spared that fate again by a mere point), Genoa refocused their energy and were able to achieve promotion back into Serie A in 1988–89, finishing as champions ahead of Bari. Genoa, with an experienced trainer as Osvaldo Bagnoli who knew how to make the best out of underdog teams (he managed to win a championship at the helm of Hellas Verona in the eighties) and with a team sporting the talents of Carlos Aguilera and Tomáš Skuhravý among others achieved highs during the 1990–91 season where they finished fourth, remaining undefeated at home for the entire campaign, winning games against <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> sides including Juventus, Inter, Milan, Roma, Lazio, Fiorentina, Napoli, as well as their local rivals Sampdoria who won the title that season.|$|E

25|$|On 2 May 2008, US President George W. Bush said he {{was asking}} Congress to approve an extra $770million funding for {{international}} food aid. On 16 October 2008, in a speech at a United Nations gathering on World Food Day, former US president Bill Clinton criticized the bipartisan coalition in Congress that blocked efforts to make some aid donations in cash rather than in food. Referring in part to policies that had pressured African governments to reduce subsidies for fertilizer and other agricultural inputs, Clinton also said:We need the World Bank, the IMF, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> foundations, and all the governments to admit that, for 30 years, we all blew it, including me when I was President. We were wrong to believe that food was like some other product in international trade, {{and we all have}} to go back to a more responsible and sustainable form of agriculture.The release of Japan's rice reserves onto the market may bring the rice price down significantly.

25|$|For {{the first}} time, {{large amounts of}} federal money went to public schools. In {{practice}} ESEA meant helping all public school districts, with more money going to districts that had large proportions of students from poor families (which included <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> cities). For the first time private schools (most of them Catholic schools in the inner cities) received services, such as library funding, comprising about 12percent of the ESEA budget. Though federal funds were involved, they were administered by local officials, and by 1977 {{it was reported that}} {{less than half of the}} funds were actually applied toward the education of children under the poverty line. Dallek further reports that researchers cited by Hugh Davis Graham soon found that poverty had more to do with family background and neighborhood conditions than the quantity of education a child received. Early studies suggested initial improvements for poor children helped by ESEA reading and math programs, but later assessments indicated that benefits faded quickly and left pupils little better off than those not in the schemes. Johnson's second major education program was the Higher Education Act of 1965, which focused on funding for lower income students, including grants, work-study money, and government loans.|$|E

For the 1896 tour, Trott was elected captain by his team-mates. [...] Despite England winning the series two Tests to one and {{retaining}} The Ashes, Trott's ability as a captain was highly regarded. In the return series in Australia during the 1897–98 season, Trott's team was more successful, winning the five-Test series 4–1 and regaining The Ashes.

[...] In reply to complaints about leave granted to Trott to play cricket, his proud employers at the Post office responded [...] "Harry Trott is a national institution."
