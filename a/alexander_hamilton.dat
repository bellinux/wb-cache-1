5|$|<b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton</b> {{was born}} and spent part of his {{childhood}} in Charlestown, {{the capital of the}} island of Nevis in the Leeward Islands (then part of the British West Indies). Hamilton and his older brother James Jr. (1753–1786) were born out of wedlock to Rachel Faucette, a married woman of half-British and half-French Huguenot descent, and James A. Hamilton, a Scotsman who was the fourth son of Laird <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton</b> of Grange, Ayrshire. Speculation that Hamilton's mother was of mixed race, though persistent, is not substantiated by verifiable evidence.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} 32nd Street Visual and Performing Arts Magnet in Los Angeles (LAUSD) and <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton</b> High School, {{although he}} received {{most of his}} education from tutors. In an interview, LaBeouf said that, looking back on his childhood, he feels grateful and considers some of those memories scars.|$|E

5|$|A famous story, {{possibly}} apocryphal, {{states that}} during the Battle of Princeton, when <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton,</b> then the commander of an artillery battery, ordered his cannons to fire upon the British soldiers taking refuge in Nassau Hall, one of the cannonballs was shot through {{the head of the}} portrait of King George II that hung in the chapel, which was subsequently replaced with a portrait of George Washington.|$|E
5|$|At Hamilton's birthplace in Charlestown, Nevis, the <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton</b> Museum {{is located}} in Hamilton House, a Georgian-style {{building}} rebuilt on {{the foundations of the}} house where Hamilton {{is believed to have been}} born and to have lived during his childhood. The second floor of Hamilton House hosts the offices and meeting place of the island's legislature, the Nevis Island Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Columbia University, Hamilton's alma mater, has {{official}} memorials to Hamilton on its {{campus in}} New York City. The college's main classroom {{building for the}} humanities is Hamilton Hall, and a large statue of Hamilton {{stands in front of}} it. The university press has published his complete works in a multivolume letterpress edition. Columbia University's student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates is named the <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton</b> Society.|$|E

5|$|In proposing {{his plan}} for a mint and a coinage system, Secretary of the Treasury <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton</b> in 1791 {{proposed}} that the one-dollar denomination be struck both as a gold coin, and as one of silver, representative of the two metals which he proposed be made legal tender. Congress followed Hamilton's recommendation only in part, authorizing a silver dollar, but no coin of that denomination in gold.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Hamilton's early life. He was the third son of Alexander (died 1768) and Margaret Hamilton (died 1742). His two older {{brothers}} were Alexander (died 1783) and Gavin Hamilton (1723–1798), the latter a painter and archeologist in Rome. Inglis {{was added to the}} family name in 1719 as a condition of the will by which Alexander Inglis bequeathed Murdostoun to his nephew <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton,</b> James's father.|$|E
5|$|Born in Litchfield County, Connecticut, James Morris {{spent his}} early life hoping and {{training}} to be a minister. However, after graduating from Yale College, Morris accepted a commission of First Lieutenant from the Continental Army and joined the fight for American Independence. Morris was captured during the Battle of Germantown {{and spent most of}} the remaining war in captivity. Upon his release, Morris was promoted to the rank of Captain and supported <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton</b> in the Siege of Yorktown. When he returned from the war, Morris began and ran an academy that trained both boys and girls together, a rarity at the time.|$|E

5|$|Chernow, {{a former}} {{business}} journalist, {{was inspired to}} write the book while researching another biography on Washington's long-time aide <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton.</b> Washington: A Life took six years to complete and makes extensive use of archival evidence. The book was released to wide acclaim from critics, several of whom called it the best biography of Washington ever written. In 2011, the book won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, as well as the New-York Historical Society's American History Book Prize.|$|E
5|$|Gore's {{windfall}} was realized when in 1790 the United States Congress, {{acting on}} a proposal made by <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton</b> and supported by Gore's friend Rufus King, passed legislation that exchanged Continental and state paper for new U.S. paper at face value. Not only did Gore win on this exchange, but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it. The exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents: John Quincy Adams wrote that Gore's speculations made him the wealthiest lawyer in the country.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton Fish {{was born}} on August 3, 1808 at what {{is now known as}} the Stuyvesant–Fish House in Greenwich Village, New York City, to Nicholas Fish and Elizabeth Stuyvesant (a {{descendant}} of New Amsterdam's Peter Stuyvesant), and his parents named him after their friend <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton.</b> Nicholas Fish (1758–1833) was a leading Federalist politician and notable figure of the American Revolutionary War. Col. Fish was active in the Yorktown Campaign that resulted in the surrender of Lord Cornwallis. Peter Stuyvesant was a prominent founder of New York, then a Dutch Colony, and his family owned much property in Manhattan.|$|E
50|$|In August 1986, <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamiltons</b> crew {{learned that}} her {{refueling}} overhaul would be conducted by the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Bremerton, Washington. She departed Groton on 1 October 1986 to begin the voyage to Bremerton. Steaming {{by way of the}} Panama Canal, she arrived at Bremerton late in November 1986.

5|$|In 1791, {{following}} {{a study by}} <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton,</b> Congress passed a joint resolution calling {{for the establishment of}} a national mint. Later that year, in his third State of the Union address, President George Washington urged Congress to provide for a mint, which was officially authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. Despite the authorization, silver and gold coins were not struck until 1794. The Flowing Hair dollar, designed by Robert Scot, was initially produced in 1794, and again in 1795. In October 1795 the design was replaced by the Draped Bust dollar.|$|E
5|$|Keyes {{earned his}} Ph.D. in {{government}} affairs from Harvard University in 1979, having written a dissertation on <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton</b> and constitutional theory, under Harvey C. Mansfield. Due to student deferments {{and a high}} draft number, Keyes was not drafted {{to serve in the}} Vietnam War. Keyes and his family were staunch supporters of the war, in which his father served two tours of duty. Keyes was criticized by opponents of the war in Vietnam, but he says he was supporting his father and his brothers, who were also fighting in the war.|$|E
5|$|Some {{location}} shooting {{took place}} in New York City. The <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton</b> U.S. Custom House served as the exterior for NYPD headquarters, and an apartment house at 15 West 81st Street, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, {{was used as the}} exterior for the home of Gwen Stacy and her family.

5|$|The Federalist Papers (specifically Federalist No. 84) are {{notable for}} their {{opposition}} to what later became the United States Bill of Rights. The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was originally controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or {{protect the rights of}} the people, rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained to the states and the people. <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton,</b> the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the only rights that people had.|$|E
5|$|The United States Coast Guard {{was formed}} in 1915 when its {{predecessors}} – the United States Life-Saving Service and the United States Revenue Cutter Service, which was established in 1790 by Secretary of the Treasury <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton</b> as an armed maritime law enforcement service – were merged. According to Dr. William H. Thiesen, Ph.D., Atlantic Area Historian of the United States Coast Guard, the following events involving Hispanics occurred {{in the early years}} of the Coast Guard its predecessor services.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of 1796 {{was the first}} contested American presidential election. Twice, George Washington had been elected to office unanimously; however, during his presidency, deep philosophical {{differences between the two}} leading figures in the administration – <b>Alexander</b> <b>Hamilton</b> and Thomas Jefferson – regarding domestic economic policy and U.S. foreign policy caused a rift between them, and led to the founding of the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party. Thus, when Washington announced {{that he would not be}} a candidate for a third term, an intense partisan struggle for control of Congress and the presidency began.|$|E
