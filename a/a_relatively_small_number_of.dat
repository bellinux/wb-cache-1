5|$|Greece's mountainous terrain {{favored a}} {{defensive}} strategy {{and the high}} ranges of the Rhodope, Epirus, Pindus and Olympus mountains offered many defensive opportunities. However, air power was required to protect defending ground forces from entrapment in the many defiles. Although an invading force from Albania could be stopped by <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> troops positioned in the high Pindus mountains, the northeastern {{part of the country}} was difficult to defend against an attack from the north.|$|E

Old Saybrook had previous had only a single side platform serving <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Amtrak trains; the rebuilt has two platforms serving three tracks, to allow Amtrak trains in both directions to stop or pass even while a SLE train is at the station.|$|E

5|$|In Europe and the Americas, <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> DPB {{cases have}} been {{reported}} in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Virtually all {{microbes}} {{can trigger}} an antibody response. Successful recognition and eradication {{of many different}} types of microbes requires diversity among antibodies; their amino acid composition varies allowing them to interact with many different antigens. It has been estimated that humans generate about 10billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen. Although a huge repertoire of different antibodies is generated in a single individual, the number of genes available to make these proteins is limited {{by the size of the}} human genome. Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that allow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> antibody genes.|$|E
5|$|Romney soon {{switched}} Bain Capital's {{focus from}} startups {{to the relatively}} new business of leveraged buyouts: buying existing companies with money mostly borrowed from banking institutions using the newly bought companies' assets as collateral, then taking steps to improve the companies' value, and finally selling those companies once their value peaked, usually within a few years. Bain Capital lost money in many of its early leveraged buyouts, but then found deals that made large returns. The firm invested in or acquired Accuride Corporation, Brookstone, Domino's Pizza, Sealy Corporation, Sports Authority, and Artisan Entertainment, {{as well as some}} lesser-known companies in the industrial and medical sectors. Much of the firm's profit was earned from <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> deals; Bain Capital's overall success-to-failure ratio was about even.|$|E

5|$|Some rodent {{species are}} serious {{agricultural}} pests, eating {{large quantities of}} food stored by humans. For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia {{was estimated to be}} enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> species, chiefly rats and mice. In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers.|$|E
5|$|Despite the orders, <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> people {{evacuated}} for the hurricane. According to {{a telephone}} {{survey conducted by}} the United States Department of Commerce, the highest participation rate was for residents in the Northern Neck in areas potentially affected by the storm surge from a Category2 hurricane, of which 41% in the survey stated they left their houses for a safer location. In Surry, only 9% of those in a Category2 hurricane storm surge zone left. 30% who participated in the survey along the Eastern Shore left. The primary reasons for the choice whether to evacuate or not were due to the track of Isabel, its strength, or influence from the media. Most participants in the survey stated they did not hear any sort of evacuation notice from public officials in their location, however. Of those who evacuated, about 64% left for the house of a friend or a relative, with about 24% evacuating to a hotel or a motel. Most of those in Hampton and Norfolk left for elsewhere in the state, while the majority of those in the Northern Neck evacuated to destinations in their own neighborhood or community. The evacuation destinations on the Eastern Shore of Virginia were varied, with 23% leaving for Maryland and 46% staying in their own neighborhood or community. The length of the evacuation process varied between a few hours to two days, with the worst evacuation problems being closed or flooded roads. The Virginia Army National Guard and State Police troopers assisted in the evacuations. In all, more than 160,000 residents in southeastern Virginia were told to evacuate, including 11,000 in vulnerable locations along the Chesapeake Bay and all residents in mobile home parks in Chesapeake and Newport News. A total of about 16,325people evacuated to 67 shelters. Some of the reported problems were shortages of supplies, unanticipated medical issues, overcrowding, and lack of security.|$|E
