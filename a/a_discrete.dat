5|$|If {{the state}} space is the {{integers}} or natural numbers, then the stochastic process is called <b>a</b> <b>discrete</b> or integer-valued stochastic process.

If the state space is -dimensional Euclidean space, then the stochastic process is called a -dimensional vector process or -vector process.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1760s in Paris the first Parisian neoclassical chairs were made, {{even before the}} {{accession}} of Louis XVI, whose name {{is attached to the}} first phases of the style. Straight tapering fluted legs joined by a block at the seat rail and architectural mouldings, characterize the style, in which each element is <b>a</b> <b>discrete</b> entity.

Most revisions of the original system contain <b>a</b> <b>discrete</b> YM2612 and a separate YM7101 VDP; the functionality of these two chips was later integrated into a single custom ASIC (FC1004) for the model 2 and later revisions.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} different, but equivalent, axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic. While some axiomatizations, {{such as the}} one just described, use a {{signature}} that only has symbols for 0 and the successor, addition, and multiplications operations, other axiomatizations use the language of ordered semirings, including an additional order relation symbol. One such axiomatization begins with the following axioms that describe <b>a</b> <b>discrete</b> ordered semiring.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{the drug}} {{has a unique}} effect on dental health has been {{questioned}} by a few academics, who note that the long-term use of several other drugs sometimes causes dental problems. Several academic reviews have contradicted this perspective, affirming meth mouth's status as <b>a</b> <b>discrete</b> condition. In favor of its unique status, these reviews cite the differences between methamphetamine-caused caries and those that occur for other reasons, such as cocaine use, {{as well as the}} scope of the tooth decay found in some long-term methamphetamine users.|$|E
5|$|With about 750 species, Ficus (Moraceae) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{angiosperm}} genera (David Frodin of Chelsea Physic Garden ranked it as the 31st largest genus). Ficus aurea is classified in the subgenus Urostigma (the strangler figs) and the section Americana. Recent molecular phylogenies have shown that subgenus Urostigma is polyphyletic, but have strongly supported the validity of section Americana as <b>a</b> <b>discrete</b> group (although its exact relationship to section Galoglychia is unclear).|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} ideal {{structure}} of reduced crossed product of topological dynamical systems of <b>a</b> countable <b>discrete</b> group. More concretely, for a compact Hausdorff space X with an action of <b>a</b> countable <b>discrete</b> group Γ, {{we consider the}} absence of a non-zero ideals in the reduced crossed product C(X) _r Γ which has a zero intersection with C(X). We characterize this condition by a property for amenable subgroups of the stabilizer subgroups of X in terms of the Chabauty space of Γ. This generalizes Kennedy's algebraic characterization of the simplicity for a reduced group C^*-algebra of <b>a</b> countable <b>discrete</b> group. Comment: 16 page...|$|R

5|$|The main or primary bronchi {{enter the}} lungs at the hilum and {{initially}} branch into secondary bronchi {{also known as}} lobar bronchi that supply air to each lobe of the lung. The lobar bronchi branch into tertiary bronchi also known as segmental bronchi and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as bronchopulmonary segments. Each bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus and arterial supply. Segments for {{the left and right}} lung are shown in the table. The segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localising disease processes in the lungs.

5|$|The {{nucleolus}} is <b>a</b> <b>discrete</b> densely stained structure {{found in}} the nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a suborganelle. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions (NOR). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.|$|E
