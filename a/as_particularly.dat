5|$|English jurist Jeremy Bentham was {{a critic}} of Blackstone's {{theories}}. Others saw Blackstone's theories as inaccurate statements of English law, using the Constitutions of Clarendon, the Tractatus of Glanville and the 1689 Bill of Rights <b>as</b> <b>particularly</b> obvious examples of laws Blackstone omitted.|$|E
5|$|The season's {{activity}} {{can be quantified}} in an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 61. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of the}} power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed; therefore, storms that last a long time, as well <b>as</b> <b>particularly</b> strong hurricanes, have high ACE ratings.|$|E
5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted <b>as</b> <b>particularly</b> detrimental.|$|E

5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler <b>as</b> <b>particularly</b> unfair. Paul {{does not believe in}} legalizing the recreational use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine, but does not support jailing marijuana users. He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E
5|$|Edward had a {{reputation}} for a fierce temper, and he could be intimidating; one story tells of how the Dean of St Paul's, wishing to confront Edward over the high level of taxation in 1295, fell down and died once he was in the King's presence. When Edward of Caernarfon demanded an earldom for his favourite Gaveston, the King erupted in anger and supposedly tore out handfuls of his son's hair. Some of his contemporaries considered Edward frightening, particularly in his early days. The Song of Lewes in 1264 described him as a leopard, an animal regarded <b>as</b> <b>particularly</b> powerful and unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the launch}} of British Airways Concorde services, Britain's other major airline, British Caledonian (BCal), set up a task force headed by Gordon Davidson, BA's former Concorde director, to {{investigate}} the possibility of their own Concorde operations. This was seen <b>as</b> <b>particularly</b> viable for the airline's long-haul network as there were two unsold aircraft then available for purchase.|$|E

5|$|Reviews of {{the game}} were {{generally}} positive. Critics focused primarily on the visuals, music and atmosphere <b>as</b> <b>particularly</b> praiseworthy. Additional positive comments were made about the controls and gameplay, while critiques centered on the map system and a limited variety of objectives.

5|$|The season's {{activity}} {{was reflected in}} a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 32. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of the}} power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well <b>as</b> <b>particularly</b> strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34knots (39mph, 63km/h) or tropical storm strength.|$|E
5|$|The season's {{activity}} was reflected {{with a low}} accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 41. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of the}} power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well <b>as</b> <b>particularly</b> strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34knots (39mph, 63km/h) or tropical storm strength. Although officially, subtropical cyclones, such as the unnamed storm, are excluded from the total, the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase.|$|E

5|$|The season's {{activity}} was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 230, the fourth highest value on record, behind only the 1893, 2005, and 1933 seasons.

It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39mph (63km/h), which is tropical storm strength.|$|E
