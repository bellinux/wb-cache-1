5|$|Marie Thursby {{has used}} an {{extended}} {{version of the}} model to examine international trade in wheat, 60% of which is produced by the United States and Canada. Thursby includes marketing boards, possibility of a monopsony, {{and a variety of}} government policies in the analysis. She finds that while there are significant economies of scale in the industry, the barriers to entry are not high <b>and</b> <b>regardless</b> of the extent of market power that US firms have in the industry, the optimal policy is actually an export tax, rather than a subsidy.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court {{rejected}} that argument, essentially ruling that under {{federal income tax}} law all the future income earned by Mr. Earl was taxable {{to him at the}} time he earned the income, even though he had already assigned part of the income to his wife, <b>and</b> <b>regardless</b> of the validity of the assignment agreement under state law. The Court in Lucas v. Earl did not rule that wages are not taxable.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} and sound of The Guardian Legend have been influential. Robert Dewar and Matthew Smosna {{of the open}} computing magazine Open Systems Today cited the game {{as an example of}} how graphics co-processors such as those in the NES can compensate for inadequate CPU speed in graphics-intensive computer applications. They noted that the fast-paced action seen in the game could not be replicated on a personal computer at that time (1992) without an expensive graphics board <b>and</b> <b>regardless</b> of CPU speed. The music of the game, composed by Masatomo Miyamoto and Takeshi Santo, has remained popular years after the game's release. Samantha Amjadali of the Melbourne-based newspaper The Herald Sun reported that a remixed tune from the game was rated as the second most popular track on the website OverClocked ReMix in March 2002. Video game cover band The Advantage's 2006 album Elf Titled featured a cover version of music from one of the game's dungeon levels.|$|E

5|$|South of {{the river}} Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, {{commander}} of XXX Corps and Lieutenant-General Frederick Browning of I Airborne Corps, decided not to reinforce the position north of the Rhine. Instead they ordered the Corps staff to prepare a plan to withdraw the division (Operation Berlin). The evacuation of the surviving 2,500men {{able to make the}} crossing was to begin at 20:45. The evacuation would be from north to south, and was modelled on the evacuation from Gallipoli in the First World War. During the day's fighting, some units had become isolated and never received the order to evacuate. Those capable of taking part were formed into groups of fourteen (the maximum capacity of the boats) and guided to the river by men from the Glider Pilot Regiment who during the day had reconnoitred and marked out two routes to the river. Under cover of an artillery barrage the evacuation started at 22:00. German infiltration of the perimeter caused problems during the withdrawal and some groups got into fire fights or were captured. When they reached the river, priority was given to the wounded <b>and</b> <b>regardless</b> of rank the soldiers waited in line for their turn to get into the boats.|$|E
5|$|The US forces made further {{attempts}} to secure Hill 206 on 13March, but several attacks were defeated after the American troops crested the South Knob. As casualties mounted, McCulloch resolved {{to abandon the}} direct approach, instead deciding that he would seek to wear down the defenders on the South Knob after patrols discovered that the Japanese had no reserves left to reinforce the position. From this it was assessed that their effort in the sector had been spent <b>and</b> <b>regardless</b> of whether they managed to hold the South Knob, they {{would be unable to}} exploit the position further. For their own part, the Japanese had also reached a similar conclusion and had begun transferring troops from this sector north to reinforce the Magata Unit around the northern perimeter in an effort to concentrate enough force in order to achieve a break in. Consequently, they had left only a small force on the South Knob. Over the following days this force was subjected to heavy bombardment and flame attacks, which lasted until the Japanese counterattack petered out on the northern perimeter and the Japanese withdrew from the position on 27March. Casualties in the Hill 206 sector amounted to 98 US servicemen killed, 24 missing, and 581 wounded. A total of 560 Japanese dead were found on top of the South Knob when the US forces reoccupied it on 28March.|$|E
