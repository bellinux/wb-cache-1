40|$|Spirituality {{and meaning}} in life are {{important}} pathways to well-being. Research has conceptually and empirically linked spirituality, religiousness {{and meaning in}} life. The present study was concerned with investigating presence of meaning (MLQ-P) and search for meaning (MLQ-S) as mediators between spirituality (religious <b>and</b> existential <b>well-being)</b> <b>and</b> hedonic <b>and</b> eudaimonic <b>well-being.</b> A multi-cultural sample of 326 South African students completed the Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ), Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS), Questionnaire for Eudaimonic Well-Being (QEWB) and the Mental Health Continuum Short-Form (MHC-SF). Structural equation modelling in Mplus was used to study direct and indirect effects. Findings show {{that the presence of}} meaning in life explains more paths between spirituality <b>and</b> psychological <b>well-being</b> than search for meaning. MLQ-P mediated the paths between existential <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> four of the five indices of psychological well-being.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{present study}} aimed: (1) {{to test the}} {{associations}} of overall physical fitness <b>and</b> subjective <b>well-being</b> with fibromyalgia severity and (2) {{to determine whether the}} combination of overall physical fitness <b>and</b> subjective <b>well-being</b> is associated with fibromyalgia severity among adult women patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 424 participants from Andalusia, southern Spain. Overall physical fitness and the components of subjective well-being (positive affect, negative affect <b>and</b> cognitive <b>well-being),</b> <b>and</b> fibromyalgia severity were assessed using the Functional Senior Physical Fitness Test Battery, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the Satisfaction With Life Scale, and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS: Overall physical fitness (β = -. 23), positive affect (β = -. 18), negative affect (β =. 26), <b>and</b> cognitive <b>well-being</b> (β = -. 18) were all associated with fibromyalgia severity. The patients with the highest overall physical fitness <b>and</b> increased subjective <b>well-being</b> reported ~ 15 % lower fibromyalgia severity than those with the lowest fitness <b>and</b> poorest subjective <b>well-being</b> (Cohen's d > 1. 0). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that higher levels of overall physical fitness <b>and</b> subjective <b>well-being</b> are independently associated with lower fibromyalgia severity. Moreover, patients with higher overall physical fitness <b>and</b> increased subjective <b>well-being</b> (high positive affect, low negative affect, or high cognitive well-being) reported lower fibromyalgia severity than those with low levels of overall physical fitness <b>and</b> subjective <b>well-being...</b>|$|R

The Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS) and Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWBS) were administered. Also frequency of church attendance was assessed. Canonical Analysis was used to investigate the data from 425 participants to determine if there is relationship between religious/spiritual <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> psychological <b>well-being.</b> A statistically significant relationship was found between religious/spiritual <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> psychological <b>well-being.</b> The following describes the nature of the relationship. First, participants who experience existential well-being tend to be self-accepting and to a lesser extent have mastery of their environment and a purpose in life. Second, participants who experience existential <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> to a lesser degree, religious well-being tend to accept themselves, have a purpose in life, possess mastery of their environment, positively relate to others, feel they are growing personally, and are autonomous.

40|$|Abstract Researchers often {{debate about}} {{whether there is a}} {{meaningful}} differentiation between psychological <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> subjective <b>well-being.</b> One view argues that psy-chological <b>and</b> subjective <b>well-being</b> are distinct dimensions, whereas another view pro-poses that they are different perspectives on the same general construct and thus are more similar than different. The purpose of this investigation was to examine these two com-peting views by using a statistical approach, the bifactor model, that allows for an examination of the common variance shared by the two types of <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> the unique variance specific to each. In one college sample and one nationally representative sample, the bifactor model revealed a strong general factor, which captures the common ground shared by the measures of psychological <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> subjective <b>well-being.</b> The bi-factor model also revealed four specific factors of psychological <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> three specific factors of subjective well-being, after partialling out the general well-being factor. We further examined the relations of the specific factors of psychological <b>and</b> subjective <b>well-being</b> to external measures. The specific factors demonstrated incremental predictive power, independent of the general well-being factor. These results suggest that psycho-logical <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> subjective <b>well-being</b> are strongly related at the general construct level, but their individual components are distinct once their overlap with the general construct of well-being is partialled out. The findings thus indicate that both perspectives have merit, depending on the level of analysis...|$|R

5|$|The zoo {{provides}} sanctuary to {{many animals}} that {{need a place}} to live for various reasons. Some (like the Arabian oryx, Bali mynah, rhinoceros hornbill, Mexican gray wolf, and white rhinoceros) participate in captive breeding programs, some (such as the African spotted dogs) have retired from such programs and need a home, some have behavioral problems, and some are being rehabilitated to return to the wild. Animals that are in sanctuary are treated somewhat differently from other animals by the zoo. While normal exhibits balance the needs of the animals with those of visitors (for example, incorporating large viewing areas), the sanctuary exhibits are almost completely focused on the comfort <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> of the animals.|$|E

5|$|His {{behaviour}} {{on campaign}} {{can only be}} described as perfectly honourable and at times humane, a trait which was illustrated during the French Revolutionary Wars, when he spared no effort to protect captured émigrés from the wrath of the Revolutionary radicals in the army.

As a sign a gratitude, he was offered gifts several times but he was often seen refusing and sending them back. While on campaign in Tyrol, he was recorded to have accepted a large sum of money but he immediately distributed it to the local hospitals. Further evidence of his humanity was the care that he displayed for the lives <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> of his men, whom he was always reluctant to sacrifice for the sake of glory.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, have {{control over their own}} health <b>and</b> <b>well-being.</b> They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E

Among the concerned monarchs were the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, who feared for the life <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> of his sister, the Queen of France, Marie Antoinette. In August 1791, in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, in which they declared {{the interest of the}} monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis XVI and his family.

5|$|Though not {{resident}} {{in the two}} boys' household, Edward I had taken great interest in the princes' upbringing <b>and</b> <b>well-being.</b> Before he died, the king had promised to provide Edmund with substantial grants of land. In August 1306, Edward I signed a charter promising Edmund land worth 7000 marks a year, and in May 1307, 1000 marks was added to this. He probably intended to give the earldom of Norfolk to Thomas, while Edmund would receive the earldom of Cornwall, which had been left vacant after Edward I's cousin Edmund died without children in 1300. When Edward II came to the throne, however, he went against his father's wishes by granting the earldom of Cornwall to his favourite Piers Gaveston. According to the chronicle Vita Edwardi Secundi, this act was a grave insult to the king's younger brothers. Edward II nevertheless took steps to provide his half-brother with an income; grants made in 1315 and 1319 secured Edmund 2000 marks a year. In May 1321, Edmund received the strategically important Gloucester Castle, and further grants followed his creation as Earl of Kent on 28 July 1321.|$|E
