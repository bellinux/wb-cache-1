5|$|After the war, the Grand Fleet was dissolved, and Benbow was {{assigned}} to the 4th Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet, where she served until March 1926. In 1919, Captain Charles Douglas Carpendale took command of the ship, a position he held until 1921. During this period, from April 1919 to June 1920, the ship took part in anti-communist operations in the Black Sea. Benbow and other elements of the Mediterranean Fleet supported the White Russians in the Russian Civil War. In late January 1920, Benbow was sent from Constantinople to Novorossiysk. There, the ship relieved Iron Duke, and shortly thereafter rescued a group of 150 Russian soldiers and their British adviser, who had been attacked by bandits. On 1 February, Rear Admiral Michael Culme-Seymour hoisted his flag aboard Benbow. Shortly thereafter, men from the ship were sent to inspect White positions in the Kerch Peninsula. Benbow was ordered to return to Constantinople in June, where the Mediterranean Fleet was concentrating to begin supporting Greek forces during the Greco-Turkish War; she arrived there on 19 June. On 5 July, Benbow and several other vessels left Constantinople to land a force at Gemlik to secure the harbor in order to hand it over to Greek forces that would <b>arrive</b> <b>later.</b> Benbows men returned to the ship on 16 July after a Greek battalion reached the town.|$|E

25|$|Good yield {{management}} maximizes (or at least significantly increases) revenue production {{for the same}} number of units, by taking advantage of the forecast of high demand/low demand periods, effectively shifting demand from high demand periods to low demand periods and by charging a premium for late bookings.

50|$|There are {{two basic}} types: {{inhibitory}} priority effects occur when a species that arrives first at a site negatively impacts a species that <b>arrives</b> <b>later</b> by reducing the availability of space or resources. Facilitative priority effects occur when a species that arrives first at a site alters abiotic or biotic conditions in ways that positively impact a species <b>arriving</b> <b>later.</b> Priority effects are a central and pervasive element of ecological community development. These effects {{have important implications for}} natural systems as well as ecological restoration efforts.|$|R

25|$|The Russian {{army was}} divided into foreign {{mercenary}} regiments on the right (north-west) flank, and the main Russian army on the center and left (south-east) flank. The Russian battle line consisted of infantry (pikemen, musketeers, arquebusiers), mostly behind the village fences, with a second line of cavalry to the rear and on the left wing (where there were fewer fences). The Russian artillery, left in the camp, played {{no role in the}} battle. Polish units consisted primarily of cavalry, primarily the Polish hussars, with about 400 Cossack infantry on the left wing. Another 200 infantry and two cannons would <b>arrive</b> <b>later,</b> and did not participate {{in the first part of}} the battle.|$|E
25|$|The third book {{provides}} more {{details of the}} love triangle that has erupted between Fyodor, his son Dmitri, and Grushenka.

This book also introduces Smerdyakov and his origins, as well as the story of his mother, Reeking Lizaveta. At the conclusion of this book, Alyosha is witness to Grushenka's bitter humiliation of Dmitri's betrothed Katerina, resulting in terrible embarrassment and scandal for this proud woman.|$|E
500|$|Lost Luggage was {{developed}} by Games by Apollo, a video game studio based in Richardson, Texas, which targeted the game at people who traveled regularly, believing {{that they would like}} its content. At the time of Lost Luggages development, the company employed five people. The game was conceived by programmer Ed Salvo. He had been at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport after a meeting with Apollo founder Pat Roper and was waiting at the carousel for his luggage to <b>arrive.</b> <b>Later,</b> Salvo discussed the concept of the game with Roper, and they {{came up with the idea}} to have the carousel [...] "spewing unmentionables." ...|$|E

500|$|Among {{prolonged}} breeders, males usually {{arrive at}} the breeding site first and remain there for some time whereas females tend to <b>arrive</b> <b>later</b> and depart soon after they have spawned. This means that males outnumber females at the water's edge and defend territories from which they expel other males. They advertise their presence by calling, often alternating their croaks with neighbouring frogs. Larger, stronger males tend to have deeper calls and maintain higher quality territories. Females select their mates at least partly {{on the basis of}} the depth of their voice. [...] In some species there are satellite males who have no territory and do not call. They may intercept females that are approaching a calling male or take over a vacated territory. Calling is an energy-sapping activity. Sometimes the two roles are reversed and a calling male gives up its territory and becomes a satellite.|$|E
2500|$|Synthesiomyia nudiseta is {{a species}} that {{is found to be}} quite necrophilous. Like other Muscidae species, it prefers to {{surround}} itself in a wide range from garbage to human and animal remains. S. nudiseta will pupate slowly and in a restricted environment, and prefer not to migrate far away from the resource. [...] Therefore, in stages of decomposition of forensic importance it is essential to verify all areas in close proximity to the corpse. Pupa have typically been found in victims’ clothing in places such as the elastic waistbands of pants, the inner surfaces of the victim’s clothing, and even in the space in between the body and the ground. In the life cycle during stages of decomposition, S. nudiseta will be inclined to pupate with other species of flies when they <b>arrive</b> <b>later</b> in different waves. Depending on where S. nudiseta happens to be located geographically can affect how delayed the fly will take to pupate. For instance, in Hawaii, S. nudiseta is apt to feed on carrion as a food source and pupation invades similar to the flesh fly genus Sarcophaga, which is the second general decomposition wave.|$|E
2500|$|After the Mexican-American War, Henry Wayne befriended George H. Crosman. Crossman {{brought up}} {{his idea of}} using camels for {{transportation}} of people and supplies in the newly conquered American Southwest. Wayne relayed this idea to Senator Jefferson Davis; and when Davis became Secretary of War on 1853, he urged Congress {{to pass a bill}} to experiment with the camels. Wayne was chosen to lead an expedition to the Middle East to purchase $30,000 worth of camels. The group sailed to London on the USS Supply to examine camels in zoos. They then journeyed to Italy and met Grand Duke Leopold II to see his 250 camels that were said {{to be able to do}} the work of 1000 horses. They then purchased thirty-three camels: three in Tunisia, nine in Egypt, and twenty-one in Turkey. When the group arrived back, they experimented with the animals in the deserts of the western United States. Forty-one more camels would <b>arrive</b> <b>later</b> to join the corps. Congress, on the request of the Department of War, proposed a bill to buy 1,000 more camels, but the start of the Civil War quickly ended the debate [...] The experiments were also ended with the start of the Civil War, and the remaining camels were either sold or released into the wild.|$|E

2500|$|After his victory, Blake {{advanced}} on Zaragoza with 20,000 men {{divided into}} three divisions. He advanced down the Huerva River with one division on the right bank and two divisions on the left bank. Leaving Laval and a 2,000-man brigade to observe the Spanish right bank division, Suchet confronted Blake in the Battle of María on 15 June 1809. The French general deployed Musnier on his right and General of Brigade Pierre-Joseph Habert's 1st Division brigade on his left. Suchet expected some troops to <b>arrive</b> <b>later</b> {{in the day and}} planned to stall for time. Blake struck at Musnier's division but the 114th Line beat back the attack with help from a Polish lancer regiment. Suchet ordered a counterattack but the combat was halted by a hail storm. [...] At length, the French reinforcements arrived and Suchet launched Habert and Pierre Watier's cavalry at Blake's right wing. The Spanish line crumbled, but Blake was able to withdraw in relatively good order, though he lost 16 of his 25 guns. The French and Poles lost 700 or 800 casualties out of 10,000 infantry, 800 cavalry, and 12 guns. The Spanish suffered losses of 1,000 killed, 3,000 to 4,000 wounded, and hundreds captured out of 14,000 foot soldiers and 1,000 horsemen. Musnier's division was the same as at Zaragoza, with the addition of one battalion of the 2nd Reserve Legion.|$|E
60|$|It was in {{this order}} that {{we arrived at the}} St. Leonards'. Veronica, under an awning, sipping iced sherbet, {{appeared}} to be the centre of the party.

It is not likely that I shall ever, {{on this side of}} the grave, plant onion seed again. All these things I have with me. My vegetables are to come after me by freight. They are booked from Simcoe County to Montreal; at present they are, I believe, passing through Schenectady. But they will <b>arrive</b> <b>later</b> all right. They were seen going through Detroit last week, moving west. It is the first time that I ever sent anything by freight anywhere. I never understood before the wonderful organization of the railroads. But they tell me that there is a bad congestion of freight down South this month. If my vegetables get tangled up in that there is no telling when they will arrive.|$|E
