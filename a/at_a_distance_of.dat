5|$|HD 154672 b is {{a closely}} {{orbiting}} planet that {{is larger than}} Jupiter. Its mass was estimated as 5.02 that of Jupiter. HD 154672 b also orbits its host star <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> 0.6 AU every 163.91 days. Earth, in comparison, orbits the Sun <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> 1 AU every 365.25 days. However, HD 154672 b has an orbital eccentricity of 0.61, which indicates a very elliptical orbit. Because HD 154672 b has such an eccentric orbit, the equilibrium temperature of the planet varies between 300 K and 600 K, which is significantly {{higher than that of}} Jupiter (124 K). If liquid water is present in the atmosphere of HD 154672 b, it could possibly convert between gaseous and liquid phases as the planet moves along its orbit.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{establish}} simple formulas of the {{outage probability}} in cellular networks, while considering path-loss, shadowing and fast fading. Using FWBM approach, we {{take into account}} path-loss and shadowing to first express the inverse of the SIR of <b>a</b> mobile located <b>at</b> <b>a</b> given <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> its serving BS as a log-normal random variable. We then consider both path-loss, shadowing and fast fading and give an analytical expression of the outage probability <b>at</b> <b>a</b> given <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> the serving BS. Using CLCFM approach, we take into account path-loss and fast fading to express the SIR of <b>a</b> mobile located <b>at</b> <b>a</b> given <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> its serving BS. We then consider path-loss, fast fading and shadowing and give an analytical expression of the outage probability <b>at</b> <b>a</b> given <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> the serving BS. The fluid model allows us to obtain formulas that only depend on {{the distance to the}} serving BS. The analytical model that we propose is validated by comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations. The formulas derived in this paper allow to obtain performances results instantaneously.|$|R
