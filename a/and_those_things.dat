2500|$|During the 2012 {{presidential primary}} campaign, {{when asked what}} the federal government’s role should be in {{responding}} to natural disasters, Romney suggested that responsibility for handling disasters should be taken from FEMA, the federal agency dedicated to disaster relief, and given to the states, or outsourced to the private sector: [...] "Every time you have an occasion to take something {{from the federal government}} and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further, and send it back to the private sector, that's even better. Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep? We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? <b>And</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> we've got to stop doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in." [...] Asked whether by that he specifically meant disaster relief, he replied, “we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off. It makes no sense at all.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Dravid was {{a picture}} of calm and patience, as he played yet another {{important}} innings to turn around India's fortunes. His 92 however, lacked in the polish that was exhibited in his two knocks in Adelaide, as he played and missed sometimes. But he retained an excellent control over almost all bowlers, and played a lot of dot balls, and put away the bad deliveries for the boundaries, explaining his high boundary rate. Dravid was dismissed by Lee, edging a delivery to Adam Gilchrist behind the stumps. Dravid was dismissed when the score was 253, and was the fifth man out. After his dismissal for a gritty 92, the Indian innings came to an end rather rapidly, as only a further 33 runs were added for the loss of five wickets, including that of Ganguly's who was dismissed for 73. Brad Williams {{turned out to be the}} chief destroyer of the Indian innings with a haul of 4 wickets, and constantly troubled Ganguly. Williams, who was a surprise pick over Andy Bichel, expressed his joy on being able to scalp four against the Indian batting order. He also praised Dravid for his batting. Dravid himself commented that it had been an uphill struggle for most of the day, [...] "It was never comfortable. When me and Sourav were going well, there was a bit of hope. But to be honest, we needed something special to happen, an Eden Gardens or an Adelaide. <b>And</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> don't happen everyday.". India's spectacular collapse left Australia needing only 95 runs for a victory.|$|E
