25|$|Also {{important}} were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing {{the national}} purpose and his skill {{in keeping the}} border states committed to the Union cause. The Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers. The Confederate government failed {{in its attempt to}} get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly Britain and France. Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities. Lincoln's naval blockade was 95 percent effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and Britain's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> either Britain or France would enter the war.|$|E
25|$|The Polish nobles {{gathered}} at the rebellion formed a council and outlined their demands in 67 articles. They demanded the dethronement of Sigismund III for breaching the Henrician Articles and the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. They further demanded that the Sejm was to appoint state officials instead of the king; that local officials should be elected and not appointed; and that the rights of Protestants should be expanded and protected. The 1607 Parliament rejected the demands. Meanwhile, the rebel nobles gathered {{in the town of}} Guzów. In 1607 the Polish Royal Army, led by Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, was sent to pacify the rebels. A full-scale battle ensued on 5 July, with 200 casualties, which resulted in the victory of the Royalist forces. By 1609 the rebellion was over. Two years after the start of the revolt, the rebellious nobles formally surrendered to the king at the 1609 meeting of the Sejm, which became known as the Pacification Sejm. In return for their surrender the rebels were granted leniency. Many royal supporters, including Hetman Chodkiewicz, had successfully argued for amnesty for the rebels. Despite the failure of the rebellion, it nevertheless ruined <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> Sigismund III had to strengthen his role in the government.|$|E

Is there <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> this young man could send me the symphony so that I might take a look at it? I should also like to know whether he completed it, either conceptually or practically, with your or Rimsky-Korsakov's help." [...] Balakirev replied, [...] "You ask about Glazunov. He is a very talented young man who studied for a year under Rimsky-Korsakov. When he composed his symphony, he did not need any help." [...] Tchaikovsky studied the score for Glazunov's First String Quartet, and wrote his brother Modest, [...] "Despite its imitation of Korsakov ... a remarkable talent is discernible." [...] Glazunov later sent Tchaikovsky a copy of his Poème lyrique for orchestra, about which Tchaikovsky had written enthusiastically to Balakirev, and had recommended for publication to his publisher P. Jurgenson.|$|E
500|$|The Army of the Rhine and Moselle {{experienced}} excruciating command {{problems in}} its early operations, and these were especially problematic in campaign failures of 1795.

Once Jourdan was eliminated from support and withdrew to {{the west bank of the}} Rhine, Charles could focus his attention on Moreau. By October, they were fighting on the western slope of the Black Forest and by December, Charles had the French forces under siege at the principal river crossings of Kehl and Hüningen.

500|$|In 1833 Davis was {{encouraged}} by National Republican Party leaders to run for Governor of Massachusetts, against former President John Quincy Adams, who was running on the Anti-Masonic ticket, and Democrat Marcus Morton. [...] His political support came from textile interests and a faction of the National Republicans (later Whigs) led by Abbott Lawrence, as well as outgoing Governor Levi Lincoln, Jr. [...] In the election Davis gained a plurality of votes, but not the majority that was then required. [...] As a result, the state legislature decided the election, choosing Davis when Adams withdrew, preferring him over Morton. [...] The Whig-controlled legislature did nothing to reward the Anti-Masons for Adams' move, breaking up <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> the two parties would form a working relationship. [...] Davis was reelected in 1834, aided by a general dislike in Massachusetts for President Jackson's attacks on the Second Bank of the United States. [...] During these two terms, Davis made no particular initiatives of his own, continuing Lincoln's business-friendly fiscal and economic policies.

Martin also said expenses paid to Mr Ahern in his capacity as a former taoiseach were too high and should be reduced. He was commenting on reports that Mr Ahern had claimed €265,000 for [...] "secretarial services" [...] and €7,500 on mobile phone bills since he stepped down in May 2008.
