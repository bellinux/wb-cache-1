500|$|The 1998 song [...] "Believe" [...] has an {{electronic}} vocal effect proposed by Cher, {{and was the}} first commercial recording to feature Auto-Tune—an <b>audio</b> <b>processor</b> originally intended to disguise or correct off-key inaccuracies in vocal music recordings—as a deliberate creative effect. After the success of the song, the technique became known as the [...] "Cher effect" [...] and has since been widely used in popular music.

500|$|Widely {{considered}} by music critics and listeners alike {{to be the}} most radio-friendly track on Graduation, West defines the studio album's third single [...] "Good Life" [...] as the song with the most [...] "blatant hit-recordness". The track features vocals from R singer T-Pain, who utilizes the voice <b>audio</b> <b>processor</b> technology of Auto-Tune. West had previously experimented with the technology on his debut album The College Dropout for the background vocals on the songs [...] "Jesus Walks" [...] and [...] "Never Let Me Down". During his brief stay in Sweden, West sent through sixteen different mixes of [...] "Good Life" [...] over to their recording studio for the audio mastering process. West admitted that he actually did not really care for the single, but he was pressured into releasing it by his record label Def Jam Recordings. However, West has since clarified that he doesn't retain any lingering animosity whatsoever towards his record label in regards to this.|$|E

500|$|In Paris, Ahmadzaï worked obsessively to {{complete}} the recording of [...] "Impressive Instant", applying his characteristic sound mangling. He used the Antares Auto-Tune plug-in set for the pitch correction. Explaining that the <b>audio</b> <b>processor</b> kept the characteristic of the voice, he recalled that Madonna was not afraid to use it, unlike other artists; she just had to sing {{a little out of}} tune and vibrato. The song had LFO sweeps at its beginning, panning from its left and right, which created the backdrop of the track. To achieve this, Ahmadzaï used a Nord Lead synthesizer, passed through an audio filter. The bass used in the song was subdued, and did not contain any music in high or mid-range. Instead of using a Minimoog synthesizer, Ahmadzaï used a Korg Prophecy analog-modelling synthesizer which added a different texture to the song. Audio filters were used for the first appearance of a melody and Madonna's voice was processed through an Eventide 3000 harmonizer, finally adding effects from filters and E6400 emulator. Also, Ahmadzaï added his characteristic stuttering sounds to the song, explaining: ...|$|E
500|$|West's life took a {{different}} direction when his mother, Donda West, died of complications from cosmetic surgery involving abdominoplasty and breast reduction in November 2007. Months later, West and fiancée Alexis Phifer ended their engagement and their long-term intermittent relationship, which had begun in 2002. The events profoundly affected West, who set off for his 2008 Glow in the Dark Tour shortly thereafter. Purportedly because his emotions could not be conveyed through rapping, West decided to sing using the voice <b>audio</b> <b>processor</b> Auto-Tune, which would become {{a central part of}} his next effort. West had previously experimented with the technology on his debut album The College Dropout for the background vocals of [...] "Jesus Walks" [...] and [...] "Never Let Me Down." [...] Recorded mostly in Honolulu, Hawaii in three weeks, West announced his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak, at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, where he performed its lead single, [...] "Love Lockdown". Music audiences were taken aback by the uncharacteristic production style and the presence of Auto-Tune, which typified the pre-release response to the record.|$|E
500|$|The album makes {{prominent}} use of {{the voice}} <b>audio</b> <b>processor</b> technology of Auto-Tune. West had previously experimented with the technology on The College Dropout for the background vocals of [...] "Jesus Walks" [...] and [...] "Never Let Me Down", {{but he had not}} used it for lead vocals until 2008. [...] "We were working on the remixes for Lil Wayne's 'Lollipop' and Young Jeezy's 'Put On' and {{he fell in love with}} the Auto-Tune", producer Mike Dean explained. Towards the end, West enlisted T-Pain for coaching on how to utilize the technology. West himself openly stated that he loved using Auto-Tune and was dismayed that the term has been commonly associated with being [...] "wack". He considers the technology [...] "the funnest thing to use" [...] and compared the situation to when he was a child and thought the color pink was cool until someone told him [...] "it was gay", producing an analogy of how the views of society can rob people of their confidence and self-esteem. He later went on to state that he enjoyed the electronic feel produced by Auto-Tune and sought out to juxtapose the mechanical sounds with the traditional sounds of taiko drums and choir monks.|$|E

In 1980 Eno developed an interest in altered guitar tunings, which led to Guitarchitecture discussions with Chuck Hammer, former Lou Reed guitarist. Recorded in France and Germany, the spacey effects on Low were largely created by Eno, who played a portable EMS Synthi A synthesizer.
