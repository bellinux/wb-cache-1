Titania's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 8.7 days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Titania is a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always pointing toward the planet.|$|E

Roy shot 1-for-8 the first 2 games, {{including}} a Game 2 where he saw only 8 minutes of playing time and went scoreless. The Blazers lost both games and trailed 0–2 in the series. He expressed his frustration <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> last substitution during the first 2 quarters, and playing for 8 minutes after getting 26 minutes in Game 1. The series then went to Portland, and Roy scored 16 points in 23 minutes off the bench to boost the Blazers to a 97–92 Game 3 win.|$|E

Later, Miz {{was confronted by}} Apollo Crews {{with the help of}} comedian Gabriel Iglesias backstage, and then participated in a fatal 4-way {{elimination}} match involving Ziggler, Ambrose and Luke Harper, where he was eliminated by Ambrose. The following week, Miz successfully defended the championship against Crews. After the match, Miz was interviewed by Renee Young, where Miz sarcastically responded by revealing Young and Ambrose's real life relationship, prompting her to slap Miz. On the January 3, 2017 episode of SmackDown, Miz lost the Intercontinental Championship to Ambrose despite interference from Maryse. On the January 10 episode of SmackDown, Miz announced his participation in the 2017 Royal Rumble match at Royal Rumble pay-per-view. On January 29, after entering the match at number 15, Miz lasted 32 minutes until he was eliminated by The Undertaker.|$|E

5|$|Umbriel orbits Uranus at the {{distance}} of <b>about</b> , <b>being</b> <b>the</b> third farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Umbriel's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 4.1Earth days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Umbriel is a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always pointing toward its parent planet. Umbriel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere (like Umbriel) are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet. This bombardment {{may lead to the}} darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Umbriel also serves as a sink of the magnetospheric charged particles, which creates a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit as observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.|$|E

25|$|On August 2, 2007, {{after much}} {{independent}} investigation, {{it was revealed}} that discredited South Korean scientist Hwang Woo-Suk unknowingly produced the first human embryos resulting from parthenogenesis. Initially, Hwang claimed he and his team had extracted stem cells from cloned human embryos, a result later found to be fabricated. Further examination of the chromosomes of these cells show indicators of parthenogenesis in those extracted stem cells, similar to those found in the mice created by Tokyo scientists in 2004. Although Hwang deceived the world <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> first to create artificially cloned human embryos, he did contribute a major breakthrough to stem cell research by creating human embryos using parthenogenesis. The truth was discovered in 2007, long after the embryos were created by him and his team in February 2004. This made Hwang the first, unknowingly, to successfully perform the process of parthenogenesis to create a human embryon and, ultimately, a human parthenogenetic stem cell line.|$|E
25|$|As King Zheng grew older, Lü Buwei became {{fearful that}} the boy king would {{discover}} his liaison with his mother Lady Zhao. He decided to distance himself {{and look for a}} replacement for the queen dowager. He found a man named Lao Ai. According to The Record of Grand Historian, Lao Ai was disguised as a eunuch by plucking his beard. Later Lao Ai and queen Zhao Ji got along so well they secretly had two sons together. Lao Ai then became ennobled as Marquis Lào Ǎi, and was showered with riches. Lao Ai's plot was supposed to replace King Zheng with one of the hidden sons. But during a dinner party drunken Lào Ǎi was heard bragging <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> young king's step father. In 238 BC the king was travelling to the ancient capital of Yōng (雍). Lao Ai seized the queen mother's seal and mobilized an army in an attempt to start a coup and rebel. When King Zheng found out this fact, he ordered Lü Buwei to let Lord Changping and Lord Changwen attack Lao Ai and their army killed hundreds of the rebels at the capital, although Lao Ai succeeded in fleeing from this battle.|$|E

"Wake Up Dead" [...] {{features}} lyrics which {{describe a}} man who has been cheating on his wife or girlfriend and is sneaking into his house, knowing that if his wife finds out about his other lover, she will kill him.

Unfortunately, {{he was in love with}} another girl and thought the one he lived with would be mad because he was cheating on her. He had to leave her because he thought she had intentions to kill him. [...] "The Conjuring", according to author Bob Larson, simulates a Satanic ceremony, and makes references <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> devil's advocate and his salesman. Mustaine explained the song is about black magic and contains instructions for hexes. However, because the subject matter appears incompatible to his conversion to Christianity, the song has not been played live since 2001.|$|E

He scored the All-Stars' only touchdown with a dive {{into the end zone}} from the one-foot line in the third quarter. The Bears scored their only touchdown later that quarter on a 5-yard run by Bronko Nagurski. Mickal had a chance to tackle Nagurski before the goal line. [...] "A lot of things flashed through my mind," [...] explained Mickal. [...] "There was nothing between him and the goal line but me.

The extra point, however, was blocked by Bob Reynolds, and the game ended 7–6 in favor of the All-Stars.

500|$|Upon Louds release, {{multiple}} music critics {{wrote about}} [...] "Fading" [...] {{as part of}} their review, many of whom praised the production of the song. Emily Mackay of NME wrote about the song as part of an overall review of the album, writing [...] "A weird baroque pop opening, violin stabs and treated vocals, builds slowly into a rolling and shuddering beat and soft, sad-toned piano. Mesfin Fekadu of The Boston Globe called the track [...] "exceptional" [...] and compared the lyrical content to that of one of Rihanna's previous singles [...] "Take A Bow", writing that Rihanna is skilled at putting out songs <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> woman in a relationship who leaves the man, as she does in [...] "Fading". Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised Polow da Don's production of the song, writing [...] "Fading' strategizes with long and short elements—sustained choruses and staccato verses, edgeless keyboard chords and notes that are suddenly truncated—to capture the ambivalence of a failing romance." [...] Melissa Maerz of Rolling Stone commented that the singer manages to remain [...] "serene" [...] on the song, even with the sampling of Enya's [...] "One by One", and added that [...] "maybe the good girl gone bad is getting better?", in reference to Rihanna's third studio album title, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007).|$|E

The lyrics are half-terrible — almost too {{realistic}} as teenage thoughts — but {{the best of them}} transmit the desired message ... It’s a lackluster album, floated by two or three strong singles." [...] Josh Timmermann of PopMatters believed Breakout was [...] "a just-okay teenpop record with audible suggestions of said singer-songwriter aspirations. To be sure, it’s a stronger collection of songs than Moms and Dads with upturned noses ... would probably expect." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine rated the album two and half stars out of five, being disappointed and deeming the songs not to be a [...] "worthy follow-up" [...] to [...] "See You Again".

She's a rare talent; now she only has to survive until adulthood." [...] Ash Dosanjh of Yahoo!
