5|$|Bodily {{and spiritual}} needs were {{balanced}} symmetrically within the mansion: the kitchen (16) and the chapel (7) were both large two-storied halls, {{rising from the}} semi-basement to the first floor. This design not only provided <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>and</b> lofty space, but also allowed the servants to worship in the chapel without leaving the service floor, while their employers would worship from a private gallery, complete with fireplace, overlooking the chapel on the first floor.|$|E

5|$|Falstaff, Shallow and Silence sit {{in front}} of a warm fire, {{continuing}} from the first scene of the film. They receive news of Henry IV's death and that Hal's coronation will be held that morning. Falstaff becomes ecstatic and goes directly to the castle, thinking that he will become <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>and</b> powerful nobleman under King Henry V. At the coronation, Falstaff cannot contain his excitement and interrupts the entire ceremony, announcing himself to Hal. Hal turns his back on Falstaff and proclaims that he is now finished with his former lifestyle. As Falstaff looks up at Hal with a mixture of pride and despair, the new king banishes Falstaff. The coronation continues into the castle as Falstaff walks away, stating that he will be sent for that evening. That night, Falstaff dies at the Boar's Head Tavern, and his friends mourn him, saying that he died of a broken heart. The narrator explains that Hal {{went on to become a}} good and noble king.|$|E
5|$|The Haram Area (Noble Sanctuary) lies in {{the eastern}} part of the city; and through the bazaar of this (quarter) you enter the Area by <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>and</b> {{beautiful}} gateway (Dargah)... After passing this gateway, you have on the right two great colonnades (Riwaq), each of which has nine-and-twenty marble pillars, whose capitals and bases are of colored marbles, and the joints are set in lead. Above the pillars rise arches, that are constructed, of masonry, without mortar or cement, and each arch is constructed of no more than five or six blocks of stone. These colonnades lead down to near the Maqsurah (enclosure).|$|E
5|$|Throughout <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>and</b> open area, {{not only}} {{will there be a}} greater chance of {{favourable}} variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important role in the changing history of the organic world.|$|E

5|$|Emperor Shenzong died in 1085, {{an abrupt}} death {{since he was}} in his mid 30s. His {{successor}} Emperor Zhezong of Song was only ten years old when he ascended to the throne, so his powerful grandmother served as regent over him. She disliked Wang's reforms from the beginning, and sought to appoint more Conservative officials at court who would agree to oppose the Reformists. Her greatest political ally was Sima Guang (1019–1086), who was made the next Chancellor. Undoing what Wang had implemented, Sima dismissed the New Policies, and forced the same treatment upon Reformers that Wang had earlier meted out to his opponents: dismissal to lower or frontier posts of governance, or even exile. However, there was still mounted opposition to Sima Guang, as many had favored some of the New Policies, including the substitution of tax instead of forced labor service to the state. Sure enough, when Emperor Zhezong's grandmother died in 1093, Zhezong was quick to sponsor the Reformists like his predecessor Shenzong had done. The Conservatives once more were ousted from political dominance at court. When Zhezong suddenly died in his twenties, his younger brother Emperor Huizong of Song (r. 1100–1125) succeeded him, and also supported the Reformers at court. Huizong banned the writing of Sima Guang and his lackeys while elevating Wang Anshi to near revered status, having a statue of Wang erected in a Confucian temple alongside a statue of Mencius. To further this image of Wang as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>and</b> honorable statesman, printed and painted pictures of him were circulated throughout the country. Yet this cycle of revenge and partisanship continued after Zhezong and Huizong, as Reformers and Conservatives continued their infighting. Huizong's successor, Emperor Gaozong of Song, abolished once more the New Policies, and favored ministers of the Conservative faction at court.|$|E

Once the Siege was over, the fortifications were rebuilt and, in the following century, the walls were lined with Portland limestone. Such stone gave the walls their present white appearance.|$|E

25|$|Zeng was a voluminous writer.

Zeng enjoyed reading greatly, and held {{a special interest in}} the 23 Histories, and other Chinese classics. He was also a dedicated poet and a diary author.|$|E
25|$|Cerball {{is remembered}} in {{historical}} sources as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>and</b> heroic king, possessed of victorious and daring exploits with many colourful anecdotes written about him. He is mentioned {{in all the}} major Irish annals, bringing the Osraige into military prominence during his reign, securing a very strong marriage alliance with the high king and gaining political independence away from Munster. Irish, Scandinavian and Welsh sources record his existence; several annals in particular contain unique information about him.|$|E
25|$|Arwa al-Sulayhi {{is still}} remembered as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>and</b> much loved sovereign, as attested in Yemeni historiography, literature, and popular lore, {{where she is}} {{referred}} to as Balqis al-sughra ("the junior queen of Sheba"). Although the Sulayhids were Ismaili, they never tried to impose their beliefs on the public. Shortly after Queen Arwa's death, the country was split between five competing petty dynasties along religious lines. The Ayyubid dynasty overthrew the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt. A few years after their rise to power, Saladin dispatched his brother Turan Shah to conquer Yemen in 1174.|$|E

25|$|Taking applause as a criterion, {{the success}} of Almina was triumphant. After the first act, the {{principal}} singers were recalled, and then Signor Campana was compelled to appear, {{when he was not}} merely received with tumultuous acclamations, but fêted with bouquets and laurel-wreaths. At the fall of the curtain, too, he was summoned to the foot-lights twice, when the demonstrations were renewed, and no doubt the composer left the theatre perfectly satisfied that his opera had achieved <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>and</b> legitimate triumph. First nights, however, are not always precedents—the Barbiere of Rossini to witness.|$|E
25|$|In 1818, The History of British India was published, and {{obtained}} <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>and</b> immediate success. It {{brought about a}} change in the author's fortunes. The year following he was appointed an official in the India House, in the important department of the examiner of Indian correspondence. He gradually rose in ranks until he was appointed, in 1830, head of the office, with a salary of £1900, raised in 1836 to £2000. His great work, the Elements of Political Economy, appeared in 1821 (3rd and revised ed. 1825).|$|E
