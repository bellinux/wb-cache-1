5|$|Frawley, {{who also}} served as cinematographer for the film, had a relaxed {{approach}} to making films; he did not use screenplays and never numbered the scenes. During the assembling of Frawley's films, the sole material for editors to rely on was <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> with notes scrawled in it. The identities of the cast of The Bold Bank Robbery are unrecorded. The film, silent and shot in black-and-white, was filmed in Philadelphia. It was shot using a camera that company creator Siegmund Lubin had built back in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Solitary {{places are}} the best venues for yoga. A matha (hut) in a forest is ideal, but any private place that is free from distractions, high winds or intense {{sunshine}} is a good location for yoga. Either <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> made of kusha grass or a solid ground with deer skin mat on it, is desirable. Yoga can be learned, {{with the help of}} a teacher, within three to four months if practiced six times a day. If frequent practice is not possible, yoga can be mastered over a period of three to four years.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} for {{the first}} few months of development was for the game to be an on-rails shooter similar to Sega's light gun game Virtua Cop; GoldenEyes gas plant location was modelled by Karl Hilton with a predetermined path in mind. Although GoldenEye is controlled with <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> rather than a light gun, Hollis credited Virtua Cop as an influence on the developers' adoption of features such as gun reloading, position-dependent hit reaction animations, penalties for killing innocent characters, and an alternative aiming system that is activated upon pressing the R button of the Nintendo 64 controller.|$|E

5|$|In most of {{the class}} Enopla ("armed"), the {{proboscis}} exits from a common orifice of the rhynchocoel and mouth. A typical member of this class has a stylet, a calcareous barb, with which the animal stabs the prey many times to inject toxins and digestive secretions. The prey is then swallowed whole or, after partial digestion, its tissues are sucked into the mouth. The stylet is attached about one-third of distance {{from the end of}} the ed proboscis, which extends only enough to expose the stylet. On either side of the active stylet are sacs containing back-up stylets to replace the active one as the animal grows or an active one is lost. Instead of one stylet, the Polystilifera have <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> that bears many tiny stylets, and these animals have separate orifices for the proboscis and mouth, unlike other Enopla. The Enopla can only attack after contacting the prey.|$|E
5|$|The first egg {{is often}} laid when the nest {{is little more}} than <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> of grass, and a further egg is laid on each {{subsequent}} day. Both sexes incubate the eggs, which start hatching after about 14days; all hatch with 48hours despite the extended laying period. The black, downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected by the parents. Fledging occurs after four to six weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether the African crake has a second brood, but the corn crake usually does. Where grass is not tall enough {{at the start of the}} season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill.|$|E

When the player presses a key, <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> either covers a hole or lifts off a hole, lowering or raising the pitch, respectively.|$|E

25|$|In 1663, the German {{physicist}} Otto von Guericke {{created the}} first electric generator, which produced static electricity by applying friction in the machine. The generator was made of a large sulfur ball cast inside a glass globe, mounted on a shaft. The ball was rotated {{by means of a}} crank and an electric spark was produced when <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> was rubbed against the ball as it rotated. The globe could be removed and used as source for experiments with electricity.|$|E
25|$|Even at Second Ypres, Germany, still {{unsure of}} the weapon's effectiveness, only issued {{breathing}} masks to the engineers handling the gas. At Ypres a Canadian medical officer, {{who was also a}} chemist, quickly identified the gas as chlorine and recommended that the troops urinate on a cloth and hold it over their mouth and nose. The first official equipment issued was similarly crude; <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> of material, usually impregnated with a chemical, tied over the lower face. To protect the eyes from tear gas, soldiers were issued with gas goggles.|$|E
25|$|Muffling {{the bass}} can be {{achieved}} with the same muffling techniques as the snare, but bass drums in a drum kit are more commonly muffled by adding pillows, a sleeping bag or another soft filling inside the drum, between the heads. Cutting a small hole in the resonant head can also produce a more muffled tone, and allows manipulation in internally placed muffling. The Evans EQ pad places <b>a</b> <b>pad</b> against the batterhead and, when struck, the pad moves off the head momentarily, then returns to rest against the head, thus reducing the sustain without choking the tone.|$|E
