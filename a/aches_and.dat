40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} and compare the interaction of caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid on acetylcholinesterase (<b>AChE)</b> <b>and</b> butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and some pro-oxidants (FeSO 4, sodium nitroprusside and quinolinic acid) induced oxidative stress in rat brain in vitro. The result revealed that caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid inhibited <b>AChE</b> <b>and</b> BChE activities in dose-dependent manner; however, caffeic acid had a higher inhibitory effect on <b>AChE</b> <b>and</b> BChE activities than chlorogenic acid. Combination of the phenolic acids inhibited <b>AChE</b> <b>and</b> BChE activities antagonistically. Furthermore, pro-oxidants such as, FeSO 4, sodium nitroprusside and quinolinic acid caused increase in the malondialdehyde (MDA) contents of the brain which was significantly decreased dose-dependently by the phenolic acids. Inhibition of <b>AChE</b> <b>and</b> BChE activities slows down acetylcholine and butyrylcholine breakdown in the brain. Therefore, one possible mechanism through which the phenolic acids exert their neuroprotective properties is by inhibiting <b>AChE</b> <b>and</b> BChE activities as well as preventing oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration. However, esterification of caffeic acid with quinic acid producing chlorogenic acid affects these neuroprotective properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} {{and distribution of}} acetylcholinesterase (<b>AChE)</b> <b>and</b> cholineacetyl transferase activities (Chat) were examined in the bronchusassociated lymphoid tissue (BALT) of juvenile, adult and old rats. Histoenzymatic and immunochemical methods were used in association with quantitative analysis of images and statistical analysis of the data. Our results showed that both <b>AChE</b> <b>and</b> Chat activities were primarily confined to the BALT lymphoid cells. Only {{a low level of}} activity was observed in the sub-pleural parenchyma of the lung and in the wall of the bronchus. Moreover, both <b>AChE</b> <b>and</b> Chat activities in the BALT are specifically located in the lymphoid cells.

Finally, the intensity of histoenzymatic staining for <b>AChE</b> <b>and</b> of immunochemical staining for Chat in BALT of rats strongly decreases with age. On the basis of our results we hypothesize that both <b>AChE</b> <b>and</b> Chat activities may {{play an important role in}} BALT and both these enzymes undergo specific age-related changes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the protective effect of N-benzoyl-D-phenylalanine (NBDP), an antidiabetic compound, on the activities of acetylcholinesterase (<b>AChE)</b> <b>and</b> butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic cataract in wistar rats. Cholinesterases activities were significantly decreased with significant increase in lipid peroxidation as reflected by Thiobarbituric Acids Reactive Substances (TBARS) in the diabetic rats. This, in turn, could lead to alterations associated with diabetes complications. Treatment with NBDP appears to have reversed this effect. The decreased activity of cholinesterases observed in diabetes may be due to lack of insulin, which causes specific alterations in neurotransmitter, thus causing retinal dysfunction. NBDP could protect against direct action of lipid peroxidation on retina <b>AChE</b> <b>and</b> BChE and in this way it might be useful in the prevention of cholinergic retinal dysfunction in diabetes.

In our study, a series of novel DL 0410 derivatives were evaluated for inhibitory activities towards <b>AChE</b> <b>and</b> BuChE. Among these derivatives, compounds 6 - 1 and 7 - 6 showed stronger <b>AChE</b> <b>and</b> BuChE inhibitory activities than DL 0410.

25|$|Due to the {{cultural}} implications {{and the importance of}} bearing children, infertility in Ghana can be devastating. Throughout the years, Ghanaians have believed that both physical and spiritual ailments are the cause of infertility. Some people believe that a womb could be too hot or too cold to support a developing baby. Others believe that the cause of their infertility is witchcraft, and this belief is often supported by traditional priests who assert that the woman can be rid of a witch's curse and be allowed to conceive if the priest performs a rite in which he asks fertility gods how they can be appeased. Other spiritual beliefs involving infertility include the belief that infertility {{is the result of a}} woman's disobedience to God, in which the remedy is prayer and repentance. Women who consult a tradition birth attendant are likely to be told that prayer is the medicine for infertility, although they acknowledge that infertility is sometimes caused by a physical ailment.

25|$|Stressful working {{conditions}} {{can lead to}} three types of strains: Behavioral (e.g., absenteeism or poor performance), physical (e.g., headaches or coronary heart disease), and psychological (e.g., anxiety or depressed mood). Physical symptoms that may occur because of occupational stress include fatigue, headache, upset stomach, muscular <b>aches</b> <b>and</b> pains, weight gain or loss, chronic mild illness, and sleep disturbances. Psychological and behavioral problems that may develop include anxiety, irritability, alcohol and drug use, feeling powerless and low morale. The spectrum of effects caused by occupational stress includes absenteeism, poor decision making, lack of creativity, accidents, organizational breakdown or even sabotage. If exposure to stressors in the workplace is prolonged, then chronic health problems can occur including stroke. An examination was of physical and psychological effects of workplace stress was conducted {{with a sample of}} 552 female blue collar employees of a microelectronics facility. It was found that job-related conflicts were associated with depressive symptoms, severe headaches, fatigue, rashes, and other multiple symptoms. Studies among the Japanese population specifically showed a more than 2-fold increase in the risk of total stroke among men with job strain (combination of high job demand and low job control). Those in blue-collar or manual labor jobs are more likely to develop heart disease compared to those in white-collar jobs. Along with the risk of stroke, stress can raise the risk of high blood pressure, immune system dysfunction, coronary artery disease. Prolonged occupational stress can lead to occupational burnout. Occupational stress can also disrupt relationships.|$|E
