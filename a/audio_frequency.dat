5|$|The {{design of}} the RP-77D made {{extensive}} use of glass-polyester plastic materials. The drone was launched using a rocket-assisted take-off system consisting of four Loki rockets, and was fitted with a radio control apparatus that, {{with the assistance of}} radar tracking, allowed the drone to be operated at a considerable distance from its launching point. In addition to equipment typically carried by target drones, the RP-77D could be equipped with reconnaissance or meteorological sensors, or with air sampling equipment. The RP-77D utilised the RPTA tracking system, developed by Radioplane, using <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> tones for control. Tip tanks allowed for carriage of additional fuel to extend the aircraft's range, and recovery {{at the end of the}} flight was by parachute.|$|E
5|$|The iPad 2 has a 25W·h {{rechargeable}} {{lithium-ion polymer battery}} {{that lasts}} 10 hours, like the original iPad. It is charged via USB or included 10 W, 2 A power adapter. The battery is 2.5mm thick, 59% smaller than the original and has three cells instead of two. The improvements allowed the injection-molded plastic support frame to be omitted. The 10 W USB power adapter provides 4x {{the power of a}} conventional USB port. The tablet has an <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> response of 20 Hz to 20kHz. Without third-party software it can play the following audio formats: HE-AAC, AAC, Protected AAC, MP3, MP3 VBR, Audible formats (2, 3, 4, AEA, AAX, and AAX+), ALAC, AIFF, and WAV.|$|E

25|$|The {{audio quality}} in the airband {{is limited by the}} RF {{bandwidth}} used. In the newer channel spacing scheme, the largest bandwidth of an airband channel might be limited to 8.33kHz, so the highest possible <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> is 4.165kHz. In the 25kHz channel spacing scheme, an upper <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> of 12.5kHz would be theoretically possible. However, most airband voice transmissions never actually reach these limits. Usually, the whole transmission is contained within a 6kHz to 8kHz bandwidth, corresponding to an upper <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> of 3kHz to 4kHz. This frequency, while low compared {{to the top of the}} human hearing range, is sufficient to convey speech. Different aircraft, control towers and other users transmit with different bandwidths and audio characteristics.|$|E

50|$|The <b>audio</b> <b>frequencies</b> (20 Hz to 15 kHz), often {{referred}} to as the sum channel, would contain the sum of the left front plus left back signals in the left channel and the sum of the right front plus the right back signals in the right channel. In other words, when observing the <b>audio</b> <b>frequencies</b> only, the record appeared to have an ordinary stereo recording.|$|R

25|$|Since it is {{designed}} to turn on and off rapidly, amplifiers that use it often synthesize complex waveforms with pulse-width modulation and low-pass filters. In switching applications modern devices feature pulse repetition rates well into the ultrasonic range—frequencies which are at least ten times the highest <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> handled by the device when used as an analog audio amplifier.|$|E
25|$|By {{compressing}} {{both the}} video and audio streams, a VCD is able to hold 74 minutes of picture and sound information, nearly the same duration as a standard 74 minute audio CD. The MPEG-1 compression used records mostly the differences between successive video frames, rather than write out each frame individually. Similarly, the <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> range is limited to those sounds most clearly heard by the human ear.|$|E
25|$|In December 1919, Major E. H. Armstrong gave {{publicity}} to {{an indirect}} {{method of obtaining}} short-wave amplification, called the super-heterodyne. The idea {{is to reduce the}} incoming frequency, which may be, say 1,500,000 cycles (200 meters), to some suitable super-audible frequency that can be amplified efficiently, then passing this current through a radio frequency amplifier and finally rectifying and carrying on to one or two stages of <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> amplification.|$|E

50|$|Random noise has a {{triangular}} spectral distribution in an FM system, with {{the effect that}} noise occurs predominantly at the highest <b>audio</b> <b>frequencies</b> within the baseband. This can be offset, to a limited extent, by boosting the high frequencies before transmission and reducing them by a corresponding amount in the receiver. Reducing the high <b>audio</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the receiver also reduces the high-frequency noise. These processes of boosting and then reducing certain frequencies are known as pre-emphasis and de-emphasis, respectively.|$|R

25|$|SSTV uses analog {{frequency}} modulation, {{in which}} every different value of brightness in the image gets a different <b>audio</b> <b>frequency.</b> In other words, the signal frequency shifts up or down to designate brighter or darker pixels, respectively. Color is achieved by sending the brightness of each color component (usually red, green and blue) separately. This signal can be fed into an SSB transmitter, which in part modulates the carrier signal.|$|E
25|$|Alternating {{current is}} used to {{transmit}} information, as {{in the cases of}} telephone and cable television. Information signals are carried over a wide range of AC frequencies. POTS telephone signals have a frequency of about 3 kHz, close to the baseband <b>audio</b> <b>frequency.</b> Cable television and other cable-transmitted information currents may alternate at frequencies of tens to thousands of megahertz. These frequencies are similar to the electromagnetic wave frequencies often used to transmit the same types of information over the air.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{signalling}} {{system is a}} fixed-block cab {{signalling system}} called HKT which transmits data to the trains through low-bandwidth <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> induction loops between the rails. Different frequency combinations encode different target speeds; when a train enters a block with a lower target speed than its current speed it will initiate service braking until the two match. This allows blocks to be much shorter than the full-speed braking distance, but as the braking profile is encoded in the transmitted target speed it only works where all trains have similar braking characteristics.|$|E

25|$|In the Earth's {{magnetic}} field, NMR frequencies {{are in the}} <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> range, or {{the very}} low frequency and ultra low frequency bands of the radio frequency spectrum. Earth's field NMR (EFNMR) is typically stimulated by applying a relatively strong dc magnetic field pulse to the sample and, {{after the end of}} the pulse, analyzing the resulting low frequency alternating magnetic field that occurs in the Earth's magnetic field due to free induction decay (FID). These effects are exploited in some types of magnetometers, EFNMR spectrometers, and MRI imagers. Their inexpensive portable nature makes these instruments valuable for field use and for teaching the principles of NMR and MRI.|$|E
25|$|The codec's {{bit stream}} syntax was frozen {{at the first}} version, WMA 9 Pro. Later {{versions}} of WMA Pro introduced low-bit rate encoding, low-delay <b>audio,</b> <b>frequency</b> interpolation mode, and an expanded range of sampling rate and bit-depth encoding options. A WMA 10 Pro file compressed with frequency interpolation mode comprises a WMA 9 Pro track encoded at half the original sampling rate, which is then restored using a new compression algorithm. In this situation, WMA 9 Pro players which have not been updated to the WMA 10 Pro codec can only decode the lower quality WMA 9 Pro stream. Starting with WMA 10 Pro, eight channel encoding starts at 128kbit/s, and tracks can be encoded at the native audio CD resolution (44.1kHz, 16-bit), previously the domain of WMA Standard.|$|E
25|$|The modem is {{sometimes}} called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to {{one or the other}} of a pair of <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the mark condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the mark or space input state. In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.|$|E

500|$|While {{the meaning}} of {{mechanical}} filter {{in this article is}} one that is used in an electromechanical role, it is possible to use a mechanical design to filter mechanical vibrations or sound waves (which are also essentially mechanical) directly. For example, filtering of <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> response in the design of loudspeaker cabinets can be achieved with mechanical components. [...] In the electrical application, in addition to mechanical components which correspond to their electrical counterparts, transducers are needed to convert between the mechanical and electrical domains. [...] A representative selection of the wide variety of component forms and topologies for mechanical filters are presented in this article.|$|E
500|$|The word [...] "constant" [...] can be misleading. It {{means that}} they are {{material}} constants; but they may vary with frequency. In particular, R is heavily influenced by the skin effect. [...] Furthermore, while G has virtually no effect at <b>audio</b> <b>frequency,</b> it can cause noticeable losses at high frequency {{with many of the}} dielectric materials used in cables due to a high loss tangent. [...] Avoiding the losses caused by G is the reason many cables designed for use at UHF are air-insulated or foam-insulated (which makes them virtually air-insulated). [...] The actual meaning of constant in this context is that the parameter is constant with distance. [...] That is the line is assumed to be homogenous lengthwise.

500|$|Each Adcock range station {{had four}} [...] antenna towers erected on {{the corners of}} a 425× 425ft square, with an {{optional}} extra tower in the center for voice transmission and homing. The stations emitted directional electromagnetic radiation at 190 to 535 kHz and 1,500watts, into four quadrants. The radiation of one opposing quadrant pair was modulated (at an <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> of 1,020Hz) with a Morse code for the letter A (·—), and the other pair with the letter N (—·). The intersections between the quadrants defined four course lines emanating from the transmitting station, along four compass directions, where the A and N signals were of equal intensity, with their combined Morse codes merging into a steady 1,020Hz audio tone. These course lines (also called [...] "legs"), where only a tone could be heard, defined the airways.|$|E
