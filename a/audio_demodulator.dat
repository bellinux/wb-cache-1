It features a separate guard receiver for monitoring 243 MHz while simultaneously monitoring the active channel selected, an ECCM slice capable of storing multiple Word-of-Day patterns for Havequick operation, and can {{also serve as a}} channel selector and <b>audio</b> <b>demodulator</b> for separate UHF DF systems. There are 2 common installations: remote and panel. With a remote installation, the R/T is in a remote location, while the panel installation features an all-in-one R/T and control panel.|$|E

[...] Analog feeds were discontinued, and instead uplinked {{digitally}} (but still in SCPC fashion and on 2 satellite transponders) using Musicam encoding, and received using ComStream ABR-700 digital <b>audio</b> satellite <b>demodulators,</b> which tapped off the 70 MHz IF bus of a Satellite System Corporation Model 4421 downconverter, which was in essence the main satellite receiver for the system, taking in the L-band input from the dish's LNB.|$|R
