5|$|All {{members of}} the Junta Grande {{assisted}} to Alberti's funeral, even his political enemy Gregorio Funes. Domingo Matheu was the most affected one by his death, {{to the point of}} crying for it. Alberti was replaced in the Junta by Nicolás Rodríguez Peña, <b>a</b> <b>decided</b> morenist. Saavedra and Funes did not like him, but with the social commotion generated by Alberti's death, they avoided to offer resistance to his nomination.|$|E
5|$|Due to ill health, Blackburn {{could not}} take {{an active part in}} the {{campaign}}. He sought relief from his ailments at Crab Orchard Springs, while much of the campaign oratory was delivered on his behalf by fellow Democrats Boyd Winchester, Parker Watkins Hardin, W. C. P. Breckinridge, and others. Republicans, who had nominated Walter Evans, had fewer speakers with which to canvass the state, and were at <b>a</b> <b>decided</b> disadvantage. Democrats attacked the administrations of Republican Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, cited the alleged abuses perpetrated in the South by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, and leveled charges that Republicans favored capitalists over the state's working class. Republican orators, led by William O'Connell Bradley, charged Democrats with financial extravagance, citing a $3million surplus in the state treasury in 1865 compared with a $1million debt in 1878. Bradley claimed that Democrats had maintained their power in the state through gerrymandering election districts. He cited poor conditions at the state penitentiary and inadequate funding of public education as evidence of Democratic mismanagement of the state.|$|E
5|$|From his {{earliest}} involvement in politics, Cleveland {{aligned with the}} Democratic Party. He had <b>a</b> <b>decided</b> aversion to Republicans John Fremont and Abraham Lincoln, and {{the heads of the}} Rogers law firm were solid Democrats. In 1865, he ran for District Attorney, losing narrowly to his friend and roommate, Lyman K. Bass, the Republican nominee. In 1870, with the help of friend Oscar Folsom, Cleveland secured the Democratic nomination for Sheriff of Erie County, New York. He won the election by a 303-vote margin and took office on January 1, 1871 at age 33. While this new career took him away from the practice of law, it was rewarding in other ways: the fees were said to yield up to $40,000 (US$ today) over the two-year term.|$|E

5|$|Vahan and his Byzantine commanders did {{not manage}} {{to deal with}} this mounted force and use the sizable {{advantage}} of their army effectively. Their own Byzantine cavalry never {{played a significant role in}} the battle and were held in static reserve for most of the six days. They never pushed their attacks and even when they obtained what could have been a decisive breakthrough on the fourth day, they were unable to exploit it. There appeared to be <b>a</b> <b>decided</b> lack of resolve among the Imperial commanders, though this may have been caused by difficulties commanding the army because of internal conflict. Moreover, many of the Arab auxiliaries were mere levies, while the Muslim Arab army consisted for a much larger part of veteran troops.|$|E

25|$|Another area {{in which}} there is {{extensive}} corruption in Argentina is political financing.

Incumbents also enjoy <b>a</b> <b>decided</b> advantage.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1980, Seymour {{was given}} the role of young theatre actress Elise McKenna in the period romance Somewhere in Time.

25|$|Beginning in the 1960s, Anglo-American Hegel {{scholarship}} {{has attempted to}} challenge the traditional interpretation of Hegel as offering a metaphysical system: this has also been the approach of Z.

25|$|Some {{asserted}} that Rachmaninoff's music was derivative, {{perhaps because he}} was a Romantic at heart and eschewed much of the contemporary revolution in musical thought which was emerging in the early 20th century.

25|$|From the {{beginning}} of his public career, Sallust operated as <b>a</b> <b>decided</b> partisan of Julius Caesar, to whom he owed such political advancement as he attained. In 50 BC, the censor Appius Claudius Pulcher removed him from the Senate on the grounds of gross immorality (probably really because of his opposition to Milo and Cicero). In the following year, perhaps through Caesar's influence, he was reinstated.|$|E

As such, it was <b>a</b> <b>decided</b> escalation in the war. It was also an exceptional rainy season offensive by PAVN, which usually withdrew during the wet season.|$|E
