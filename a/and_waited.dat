On 16 February 1839 plans which had been prepared by Roe were submitted by the committee's chairman to Henry Trigg, the Superintendent of Public Works. Trigg called for other plans and prepared estimates. At a meeting of the committee on 27 February 1839, Trigg submitted a plan designed by Major Frederick Irwin, which was estimated to cost £2,300.

5|$|After {{a series}} of Russian retreats at the {{beginning}} of the campaign, the nobility grew alarmed about the advancing French troops and forced the Czar to dismiss the army's commander, Barclay de Tolly. Mikhail Kutuzov was appointed as his replacement. In a final attempt to save Moscow, the Russians made a stand near the village of Borodino, west of the town of Mozhaysk. They fortified their positions <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> for the French to attack. The Russian right wing occupied ideal defensive terrain, so the French tried to press the Russian left for much of the battle.|$|E

40|$|Delay Tolerant Networks or Disruption Tolerant Networks are {{intermittent}} {{networks that}} may lack continuous connectivity {{as most of}} the time there does not exist a direct link between source and destination for message transmission.

40|$|Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) are mobile ad-hoc {{networks}} in which connections are often disruptive or discontinuous. Data forwarding using an appropriate routing strategy {{is a highly}} confronting issue in such networks. The traditional ad-hoc routing protocols which require end-to-end connectivity fail to function here due to frequent occurrences of network partitions. Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> (SaW) routing algorithm is a popular controlled replication based DTN protocol which provides a better delivery performance balancing the average delay and overhead ratio. An empirical analysis of various spray based approaches that have been proposed for DTN has been performed in this paper to compare and evaluate the basic Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> algorithms (Source Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> <b>and</b> Binary Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait)</b> with some of its major improvements (Spray and Focus, Average Delivery Probability Binary Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> <b>and</b> Composite methods to improve Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait).</b> The main aim of this comparative study is to verify the effect of utility metrics in spray based routing protocols over simple spray based approaches. The ONE simulator {{has been used to}} provide a simulation environment to evaluate these algorithms and generate results. The performance metrics used are delivery ratio (DR), overhead ratio (OR) and average latency (ALat). The simulation results show that in terms of delivery ratio and average latency, Composite methods to improve Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> which incorporates delivery predictability metric in the <b>wait</b> phase <b>and</b> also acknowledgements to delete already delivered messages from a node’s buffer, outperforms all the other variants compared...|$|R

Although two warships, the frigate Lizard (26 guns) and the sloop-of-war Hunter (16 guns), kept up a constant patrol to prevent a river crossing, Arnold was able to procure sufficient watercraft for his men, and crossed to the Quebec City side on November 11.

5|$|After {{defeating}} the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17, 1776, commander-in-chief General George Washington brought the Continental Army {{to defend the}} port city of New York, then limited to the southern end of Manhattan Island.

In July, the British under the command of General William Howe landed a few miles across the harbor from Manhattan on the sparsely-populated Staten Island, where they were slowly reinforced by ships in Lower New York Bay during the next month and a half, bringing their total force to 32,000 troops. Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city with the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at the Narrows, and he moved the bulk of his forces to Manhattan, believing that {{it would be the first}} target.|$|E

5|$|After {{the militia}} {{advanced}} about 200yards (200m), the Kickapoo suddenly let loose a loud yell from their hidden {{position on the}} bank of an oxbow lake along the river.

Dodge did not hesitate and ordered his men to charge, they obeyed <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> until they were within six feet of the Kickapoo before discharging their weapons. The fight, after the initial charge and volley, descended into a hand-to-hand struggle with tomahawks, bayonets, muskets and spears the weapons of choice. The fighting only lasted a few minutes: nine Kickapoo were killed on the spot and the other two were felled while fleeing across the lake. During the hand-to-hand combat a fourth member of the militia, Thomas Jenkins, was wounded.

40|$|Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) {{is a type}} of {{challenge}} network, which relies on intermittent nodes to communicate. Vehicular Delay Tolerant Network (VDTN) is type of DTN where the network has an unstable topology and high node mobility. These features cause congestion issues in the network leading to a greater number of message drops. To mitigate the congestion issues in VDTN, a Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> V 2 routing protocol in implemented in the ONE simulator by extending the default Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> protocol. Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> V 2 involved the use of Utility functionality, making the protocol more efficient comparatively. Experiment on the implemented protocols and other default protocols were conducted in two parts. Part 1 focused on creating a real world VDTN scenario and the number of nodes (cars) was varied. Part 2 focused on creating a near perfect scenario and evaluated how well the protocols performed in almost perfect scenarios. The buffer size was varied for Part 2. Results from Part 1 displayed Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> V 2 has the best delivery probability, best overhead ratio and the least amount of message drops. Results from Part 2 showed that MaxProp performed the best in near perfect configurations however Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> V 2 still performed superior to Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait.</b> Hence, Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> V 2 has considerable improvement in terms of message drops and delivery probability and can be implemented in VDTN. This will significantly improve the protection of the drivers as they are more probable to receive critical messages, refining their safety on the road...|$|R

Sometime after midnight, Scott heard a commotion from Beauchamp's room. When he investigated, he found the door latch open and the room unoccupied. Beauchamp, clad in a disguise, buried a set of his clothes near the Kentucky River, then proceeded to Sharp's house. Sharp was not at home, but Beauchamp soon found him at a local hotel.

He replied to her, saying he would visit at the time appointed. Beauchamp and Cooke awaited the visit, but Sharp never arrived. When Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green to investigate, he learned that Sharp had left for Frankfort two days earlier, leaving substantial unfinished business. Beauchamp concluded that Sharp would eventually have to return to Bowling Green to finish his business there. Determined to await Sharp's return, Beauchamp opened a legal practice in the city.

The Rwandan forces in the area were taken by surprise and were mostly unable to defend against the invasion, although the Rwandan police and army did succeed for a while in repelling the invasion in some areas, killing a number of rebel fighters in the process. It is likely the FAR forces were assisted by French troops, as the French government later rewarded around fifteen French paratroopers for having taken part in the rearguard. By noon, however, the defending forces were defeated, and the RPF held the whole of the city.|$|E
