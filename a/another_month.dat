5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>month</b> of {{discussion}} and relatively minor refinement followed, during which several {{attempts were made}} to alter the Rutledge draft, though few were successful. Some wanted to add property qualifications for people to hold office, while others wanted to prevent the national government from issuing paper money. Madison in particular wanted to push the Constitution back in the direction of his Virginia plan.|$|E

5|$|For the 2006–07 season, Danny Wilson was {{appointed}} the new manager, Wilson had previously managed Humphreys at Sheffield Wednesday. On 22 August 2006, Humphreys was dropped for Hartlepool's match against Hereford United. After making 230 consecutive appearances, {{this was the}} first time Humphreys had not played since October 2001. Shortly after that match, Humphreys joined Port Vale on a month's loan. This was the third time that Danny Wilson had loaned Humphreys out during his career, the only times Humphreys had ever been loaned out. Port Vale tried to extend Humphreys' loan deal by at least <b>another</b> <b>month,</b> but Hartlepool refused and Humphreys returned. Humphreys later stated that he had no intentions of leaving Hartlepool.|$|E
5|$|He joined Conference Premier club Northwich Victoria on a one-month loan on 31 August 2007 {{to provide}} {{cover for the}} injured Lee Steele. He made his debut on 4 September 2007 in a 2–0 defeat at home to Burton Albion, in which he came close to scoring but goalkeeper Kevin Poole and defender John Brayford blocked his efforts on goal. His first goal for Northwich came with the team's only goal in a 3–1 home defeat to Histon, before being {{substituted}} in the 79th minute with calf strain. Coulson returned to Barnsley after the loan expired on 30 September 2007, despite caretaker manager Paul Warhurst having convinced him to stay at Northwich for <b>another</b> <b>month.</b> He finished the loan with two goals in six appearances.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring flew to Sicily {{himself on}} 12 July {{to survey the}} {{situation}} and decided that {{no more than a}} delaying action was possible and that the island would eventually have to be evacuated. Nonetheless, he intended to fight on and he reinforced Sicily with the 29th Panzergrenadier Division on 15 July. Kesselring returned to Sicily by flying boat on 16 July to give the senior German commander, General der Panzertruppe Hans-Valentin Hube, his instructions. Unable to provide much more in the way of air support, Kesselring gave Hube command of the heavy flak units on the island, although this was contrary to Luftwaffe doctrine. In all, Kesselring managed to delay the Allies in Sicily for <b>another</b> <b>month</b> and the Allied conquest of the Sicily was not complete until 17 August.|$|E

5|$|The sister {{trains in}} service with NSB were prone to {{technical}} failures, {{since they have}} to operate on hundred-year-old infrastructure on cross-mountain services. The Class 71 has more lenient operating conditions thanks to better infrastructure, and therefore has not been prone to as much malfunction. The only incident to ground all the Class 71 trains occurred on 17 June 2000, after a Class 73-train operated by NSB derailed at Nelaug Station owing to stress on the axles. The Oslo Airport Express Trains were back in service the next day, while the 73-series had to wait <b>another</b> <b>month</b> before returning to service. On 24 January 2004, a Class 71 unit {{had to be taken}} out of service due to smoke from a stressed bearing, causing the replacement of the bearings on all units within days.|$|E
5|$|Wallwork was loaned out to Huddersfield Town on 27 September 2007, joining up {{once more}} with manager Andy Ritchie, {{who had brought}} him to Barnsley the season before. He made his Huddersfield debut in a 2–0 home win over Luton Town on 29 September 2007. On 20 October, he scored his first goal for Town in a match against Oldham Athletic, which {{finished}} 1–1. His loan was extended by <b>another</b> <b>month</b> on 29 October. He was also given permission by West Bromwich Albion to play in Town's FA Cup first round tie against Accrington Stanley on 10 November. Wallwork's loan was extended on 22 November until 29 December, the maximum loan period of 93 days permitted under league rules, {{when he returned to}} West Bromwich Albion.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{month of}} the cabal's formation, the other team members started {{detailed}} game development, and within <b>another</b> <b>month,</b> began playtesting through Sierra. The cabal were intimately involved with playtesting, monitoring the player but otherwise not interacting, as to take the player's feedback, including any confusion or inability to solve a game's puzzle, into action items to be fixed on the next iteration of a game. Later, {{with most of the}} main adjustments made, the team included means to benchmark players' actions which they then collected and interpreted statistically to further fine-tune levels. Between the cabal and playtesting, Valve identified and removed parts that proved unenjoyable. Birdwell said that while there were struggles at first, the cabal approach was critical for Half-Lifes success, and was reused for Team Fortress 2 from the start.|$|E

5|$|Anne refused {{initially}} {{to appoint a}} new Lord High Admiral, and insisted on carrying out {{the duties of the}} office herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. She burst into tears on the first occasion she was brought papers to sign in George's stead. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of Lord Orford, a member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Admiral Churchill retired, and Anne appointed the moderate Tory Lord Pembroke to lead the Admiralty, instead of a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, however, were appointed to the Cabinet in Pembroke's vacated posts of Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The Whigs were still dissatisfied, and continued to pressure Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. <b>Another</b> <b>month</b> of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.|$|E
5|$|Dmitrii Donskoi {{began her}} second foreign cruise on 3 October 1891 when she sailed for the Mediterranean, visiting Brest, France en route. She was {{reclassified}} as a cruiser {{of the first}} rank on 13 February 1892 and remained in the Mediterranean for <b>another</b> <b>month</b> or so. The ship reached Vladivostok on 29 June, stopping at Aden, Singapore, and Hong Kong en route. Dmitrii Donskoi served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Tirtov {{several times during the}} year. She spent the winter in Yokosuka and Nagasaki before she sailed in early 1893 to America for a goodwill visit to mark the 400 anniversary of America's discovery. In Algiers in March, the ship picked up Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia and became flagship of Rear Admiral Kaznakov who commanded all the Russian ships at the exhibition. Dmitrii Donskoi reached New York City on 25 April and participated in the Presidential Review two days later. She made port visits to Philadelphia, Boston and Newport, Rhode Island before she arrived back at Kronstadt in early September.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{that their}} {{fortunes}} were dwindling, Ferdinand's rivals tried {{to settle for}} peace with Francisco Sforza. Ferdinand sent Skanderbeg as an intermediary where Giovanni Orsini and Piccinino offered peace if paid 150,000 and 110,000 ducats respectively, something that Ferdinand refused. This was one of Skanderbeg's last personal actions in Italy. He stayed in Apulia for <b>another</b> <b>month</b> until January 1462 {{when he returned to}} Albania, leaving his soldiers in Italy. His reason for leaving Italy is not clear, but it is believed that at that time Mehmed was preparing his campaign against Hungary, something which could be turned against Albania. On his return route, he again visited Ragusa, where he was likewise welcomed as a hero. He wanted to set off for Albania immediately, but bad weather forced him to stay. He was offered supplies by the Ragusan Rectors, suggesting that he wished to continue to Albania via land, but instead, after ten days in Ragusa, he sailed by ship to Albania. Before leaving, he purchased grain from Sicily for his soldiers in Apulia.|$|E

5|$|The Whigs used George's {{death to}} their own advantage. The {{leadership}} of the Admiralty was unpopular among the Whig leaders, who had blamed Prince George and his deputy George Churchill (who was Marlborough's brother) for mismanagement of the navy. With Whigs now dominant in Parliament, and Anne distraught {{at the loss of}} her husband, they forced her to accept the Junto leaders Lords Somers and Wharton into the cabinet. Anne, however, insisted on carrying out the duties of Lord High Admiral herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of the Earl of Orford, another member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Anne appointed the moderate Earl of Pembroke, on 29 November 1708. Pressure mounted on Pembroke, Godolphin and the Queen from the dissatisfied Junto Whigs, and Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. <b>Another</b> <b>month</b> of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved to}} Cardiff City in August 1924, where his friend George Latham {{was working on}} the {{training}} staff. Signed as cover Joe Clennell, Beadles was forced to wait until 27 September 1924 to make his debut for the club, covering for the injured Clennell in a 1–1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur. He was forced to wait <b>another</b> <b>month</b> to make his second appearance for the club, playing in place of Jimmy Gill during a 2–1 victory over Everton on 18 October 1924. With Gill injured, Beadles was handed a run of games in the first-team and responded by scoring five goals in four matches during November 1924, including a brace during a 4–1 victory over Bury. His prolific form saw Clennell unable to regain his place in the side as Beadles scored four more goals for the club in December, including scoring in consecutive matches against West Ham United on Christmas Day and Boxing Day 1924. However, he was unable to maintain his form and a goal drought, failing to score in ten matches in January and early February 1925, led to manager Fred Stewart dropping Beadles from the side. He appeared sporadically for the side during the remainder of the 1924–25 season, eventually breaking his goal drought during a second 2–1 victory over Everton, as Stewart offered chances to other players, including Clennell, Alfie Hagan and Paddy McIlvenny.|$|E
5|$|Later, Dylan's father's (Steve Gagnon) {{condition}} worsens, and Dylan {{brings him}} to Genoa City {{so he can}} {{keep an eye on}} him while working on Sharon's kitchen. His father dies, and he finishes Sharon's kitchen, and decides to leave town. However, he has a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), who is already pregnant and considering finding a fake father for her child, as she was divorcing the child's real father, Adam Newman (Michael Muhney). Dylan comforts Avery when she is being followed by men working for Marcus Wheeler (Mark Pinter), as a result of a dangerous case she is working on. Later, Dylan gets into a fight at Jimmy's Bar and is arrested. Avery pays his bail, but he can't leave town for <b>another</b> <b>month</b> until his hearing date, angering Nick. Chelsea then decides to pass her child off as Dylan's, and the two begin a genuine relationship despite Adam's suspicions that the child is actually his. Dylan later moves Chelsea into his new loft and proposes to her, to which she accepts, and he then arranges an impromptu wedding. Following the ceremony, Chelsea goes into labor and Dylan delivers the child, whom they name Terrence Connor McAvoy, after Dylan's father. However, the marriage ends when Dylan learns that Connor is Adam's son, not his. He also gets another shock when he discovers that he was adopted, and that his birth mother is none other than Nick's mother, Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott).|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{commissioned}} on 22 November {{and became the}} flagship of Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall, commander of the naval defenses of Georgia. Under pressure from Mallory to engage the blockading ships, Tattnall attempted to engage them before any ironclads arrived on 5 January 1863, but army engineers could not clear the obstacles blocking the channel in a timely manner, despite early coordination being made by Tattnall to do so. It took <b>another</b> <b>month</b> to actually clear the obstacles and two monitors arrived {{before the end of}} January. Nonetheless Tattnall attempted to pass through the obstructions during high tide on 3 February, but high winds prevented the water from rising enough to allow the ship to do so. After Atlanta successfully passed through them on 19 March, Tattnall planned to attack the Union base at Port Royal, South Carolina while the monitors were attacking Charleston. Deserters revealed Tatnall's plan while he was waiting at the head of Wassaw Sound and he was forced to retreat when three monitors augmented the defenses at Port Royal. Dissatisfied with Tattnall's perceived lack of aggressiveness, Mallory replaced Tattnall as commander of the Savannah squadron later that month with Commander Richard L. Page. Page, in his turn was relieved in May by Commander William A. Webb; Atlanta remained the squadron flagship throughout this time.|$|E
