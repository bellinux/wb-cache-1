40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{occurrence}} {{and potential}} orthodontic causes of cervical invasive root resorption (CIRR) are unknown. We aimed {{to identify the}} occurrence <b>of</b> <b>CIRR</b> in molar teeth of orthodontic patients treated with fixed appliances. METHODS: All patients invited for final orthodontic recall between November 2009 and March 2011 were included. From 175 patients, 108 (46 men/ 62 women; mean age, 25 ± 5 years; mean time after bracket removal, 8 ± 2 years) were available. The first and second molar teeth (N = 858) of these patients were investigated for clinical and radiographic signs <b>of</b> <b>CIRR.</b> Patients identified with such signs were asked to have limited-volume cone-beam computed tomography scans performed. RESULTS: No clinical signs <b>of</b> <b>CIRR</b> were detected. CIRR could {{not be ruled out}} on bite-wing radiographs in 18 patients. CIRR was thus identified in 1 patient in whom a second maxillary molar was affected. All first molars had been extracted in this patient, and the second molars had been moved mesially over a long distance. The 3 other second molars showed surface resorption. CONCLUSIONS: CIRR in molar teeth of orthodontic patients have a low mid-term occurrence (0. 9 %; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 2 %- 5. 2 %). Long movement distances and/or long treatment duration {{may be related to the}} development of these lesions...|$|R

50|$|As {{construction}} progressed in Shaker Heights, the Van Sweringens {{realized that}} the connection to Cleveland Railway's streetcar system through Cleveland Heights resulted in a slow trip to downtown. They planned for a grade-separated right-of-way {{all the way to}} downtown that could significantly reduce travel times for commuters, and thus increase the desirability of their suburb. In 1915 they acquired a majority interest in the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (the Nickel Plate Road), mainly to allow for a line next to a relocated NYC&StL. The next section <b>of</b> <b>CIRR</b> opened in April 1920, running west from Coventry Road down the median of the new Shaker Boulevard to Woodhill Road, then across the Cleveland Short Line Railway (New York Central Railroad) and alongside a CSL branch to East 55th Street. West of East 55th Street, where the CSL branch crossed over the parallel Nickel Plate, the new streetcar line also crossed the Nickel Plate, continuing west between the branch and Nickel Plate, then up a ramp to the intersection of the Kingsbury Viaduct (East 34th Street) and Broadway. From there, the CIRR cars traveled along the tracks of Cleveland Railway's Broadway line, using street-running {{for the remainder of the}} trip downtown.|$|R

Using a cross-sectional data set obtained via computer simulation, this study calculated the error with which the accounting rate of return (ARR) and conditional estimate of internal rate <b>of</b> return (<b>CIRR)</b> estimate IRR. The study compared the error with which both surrogates measure IRR, as well as the ability of growth in unit demand (gD), inventory cost flow assumption (INV) and depreciation method (DEP) to explain the measurement error in both surrogates.

50|$|The Van Sweringen {{brothers}} {{purchased the}} land {{of what is now}} Shaker Heights in 1906 intending to create a planned suburban community. They knew that the success of their plans depended upon the availability of streetcar service to downtown Cleveland, so they organized the Cleveland and Youngstown Railroad, later known as the Cleveland Interurban Railroad (CIRR). On October 27, 1911, with a population of only 200, the Village of Shaker Heights was incorporated, and two years later on December 17, 1913 the first section <b>of</b> the <b>CIRR</b> opened, 1.6 mi from Coventry Road east down the median of the future Shaker Boulevard (then part of Coventry Road) to Fontenay Road (west of Eaton Road). The line connected to downtown Cleveland via a line along Coventry Road to the north to an existing streetcar line on Fairmount Boulevard in Cleveland Heights. On May 20, 1915 the eastern terminus was extended from Fontenay Road to Courtland Boulevard.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with solving large-scale eigenvalue problems by algebraic sub-structuring and contour integral. We combine Algebraic Sub-structuring (AS) method and the Contour Integral Rayleigh-Ritz (CIRR) method. The AS method calculates approximate eigenpairs fast and {{has been shown to}} be efficient for vibration and acoustic analysis. However, the <b>application</b> areas <b>of</b> this method have been limited because its accuracy is usually lower than other methods. On the other hand, if the appropriate domains are chosen, the CIRR method produces accurate solutions. However, it is difficult to choose these domains without the information of eigenvalue distribution. We propose a combination <b>of</b> AS and <b>CIRR</b> such as the AS method is used as a method for profiling a distribution of eigenvalues, and the accurate solutions are produced by the CIRR method using the information of eigenvalue distribution provided by AS. We show our method is effective from the result of applying this method to the molecular orbital calculations. 1...|$|R

Since the main ingredient of oyster shells is calcium carbonate, it may be thought that the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> oyster shells is effective in suppressing Cd absorption by plants in soil contaminated by Cd, {{but there are many}} points which are not understood about this effect. In this study, combinations of {{the presence or absence of}} added Cd (1 μgg- 1) in commercial loamy soil (total Cd; 0. 38 μgg- 1) and <b>application</b> <b>of</b> calcium carbonate or of oyster shells were made, and the effects <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> oyster shells on the growth of pak choi (qinggengcai), Chinese cabbage and cabbage, and on their absorption of Cd, Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn were investigated. With the soil without added Cd, the growth of 3 species of plants was less with <b>application</b> <b>of</b> oyster shells compared to <b>application</b> <b>of</b> CaCO 3. The Cd concentrations in the leaf were 0. 01 ～ 0. 04 μg DW g- 1, and there was no significant difference between <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> oyster shells and CaCO 3. With the soil with added Cd, the dry weight of the leaves of the 3 species was about the same with <b>application</b> <b>of</b> oyster shells as with <b>application</b> <b>of</b> calcium carbonate. The Cd concentration in the leaf <b>of</b> cabbage with <b>application</b> <b>of</b> oyster shells was 1. 9 μg DW g- 1, and the Cd content was 2. 5 μg plant- 1, indicating that it is significantly lower than with <b>application</b> <b>of</b> CaCO 3.
