40|$|A {{new method}} for {{designing}} wind turbine airfoils {{is presented in}} this paper. As a main component in the design method, <b>airfoil</b> <b>profiles</b> are expressed in a trigonometric series form using conformal transformations and series of polynomial equations. The characteristics of the coefficient parameters in the trigonometric expression for <b>airfoils</b> <b>profiles</b> are first studied. As a direct consequence, three generic <b>airfoil</b> <b>profiles</b> are obtained from the expression. To validate and show the generality of the trigonometric expression, the profiles of the NACA 64418 and S 809 airfoils are expressed by the present expression. Using the trigonometric expression for <b>airfoil</b> <b>profiles,</b> a so-called integrated design method is developed for designing wind turbine airfoils. As airfoil shapes are expressed with analytical functions, the airfoil surface can be kept smooth in a high degree. In the optimization step, drag and lift force coefficients are calculated using the XFOIL code. Three new airfoils CQ-A 15, CQ-A 18, and CQ-A 21 with a thickness of 15 %, 18 %, and 21 %, respectively, are designed with the new integrated design method...|$|R

50|$|Airplane wing {{performance}} has a substantial effect on {{not only the}} runway length, approach speed, climb rate, cargo capacity, and operation range but also the community noise and emission levels. The wing performance is often degraded by flow separation, which strongly depends on the aerodynamic design of the <b>airfoil</b> <b>profile.</b> Furthermore, non-aerodynamic constraints are often in conflict with aerodynamic restrictions, and flow control is required to overcome such difficulties. Techniques {{that have been developed}} to manipulate the boundary layer, either to increase the lift or decrease the drag, and separation delay are classified under the general heading of flow control. Flow control methods are divided into passive, which require no auxiliary power and no control loop, and active, which require energy expenditure. Passive techniques include geometric shaping, the use of vortex generators, and the placement of longitudinal grooves or riblets on airfoil surfaces. Examples of active flow control methods include steady suction or blowing, unsteady suction or blowing, and the use of synthetic jets.|$|E
