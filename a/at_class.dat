25|$|Initially, R relied {{primarily}} on trained intelligence {{officers who were}} recruited directly. These belonged to the external wing of the Intelligence Bureau. In times of great expansion, many candidates {{were taken from the}} military, police and the Indian Revenue Service. Later, R began directly recruiting graduates from universities. However owing to allegations of nepotism in appointments, in 1983 R created its own service cadre, the Research and Analysis Service (RAS) to absorb talent from other Group A Civil Services, under the Central Staffing Scheme. Direct recruitment <b>at</b> <b>Class</b> I executive level is from Civil services officers undergoing Foundation course at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration. At the end of the course, R conducts a campus interview. Based on a selection of psychological tests and the interview, candidates are inducted into R for a lien period of one year. During this period, they have an option of rejoining their parent service (if they wish to) after which they can be permanently absorbed into the Research and Analysis Service. Delhi-based security think tank Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses noted in one of its reports that R suffered from the 'tail-end syndrome' where the 'bottom of the entrance lists' of those qualifying the UPSC examinations were offered jobs. Additionally, recruitment is also by lateral deputation from the Officer corps of Armed Forces or Group A Civil Service Officers. The Civil and Defence Service Officers permanently resign their cadre and join the RAS. However, according to recent reports, officers can return to their parent cadre after serving a specific period in the agency if they wish to. Most of the secretaries have been officers from the IPS and other posts are held by IRS and IFS officers. R also employs a number of linguists and other experts in various fields. The service conditions of R officers are governed by the Research and Analysis Wing (Recruitment, Cadre and Service) Rules, 1975.|$|E

The students are introduced to the new technological advancement of the cage, which will keep Animals controlled, so that they never learn to speak. Elphaba's outrage cannot be contained, and in the ensuing chaos, she and Fiyero grab the Lion cub ("Cowardly Lion") in the cage and escape.|$|E

[...] Mike Reiss and Al Jean, then dual showrunners of The Simpsons, called O'Brien and offered him a job. The series was notorious in the writing community at the time; O'Brien recalls [...] "everyone wanted to be on that show, but they never hired." [...] O'Brien {{was one of the first}} hires after the show's original crew. With the help of old Groundlings friend Lisa Kudrow, O'Brien purchased an apartment in Beverly Hills. He and Kudrow became involved as well, and Kudrow believed he should begin performing rather than writing. O'Brien disagreed, feeling that Kudrow was being overly flattering and that asserting he was happy as a writer. In his speech given <b>at</b> <b>Class</b> Day at Harvard in 2000, O'Brien credited The Simpsons with saving him, a reference to the career slump he was experiencing prior to his being hired for the show.|$|E
