5|$|A {{century later}} he was already a legendary figure; William of Tyre {{believed}} that it was Peter who had planted the idea for the crusade in Urban's mind (which was taken as fact by historians until the 19th century). It is commonly believed that Peter's followers consisted of a massive group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did not even have <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> where Jerusalem was, but indeed there were many knights among the peasants, including Walter Sans Avoir, who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Household Cavalry, the {{officers}} of the Royals and Inniskillings found {{it very difficult to}} rein back their troops, who lost all cohesion. Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor and {{his companions}} Amy Pond and her husband Rory find themselves trapped in {{what appears to be}} a 1980s hotel with constantly changing corridors. They meet Rita, Howie, Joe, and Gibbis, who have also appeared in the hotel, without <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> how they arrived. The Doctor learns that each hotel room contains the greatest fear of someone who has been in the hotel, and that a minotaur-like creature is feeding off their fear.|$|E

5|$|The loyalists {{reached the}} home of Ma Tuyen in the Chinese {{business}} district of Cholon. Ma Tuyen was a Chinese merchant and friend who {{was reported to be}} Nhu's main contact with the Chinese syndicates which controlled the opium trade. The brothers sought asylum from the embassy of the Republic of China, but were turned down and stayed in Ma Tuyen's house as they appealed to ARVN loyalists and attempted to negotiate with the coup leaders. Nhu's secret agents had fitted the home with a direct phone line to the palace, so the insurgent generals believed that the brothers were still besieged inside Gia Long. Neither the rebels nor the loyalist Presidential Guard had <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> that at 21:00 they were about to fight for an empty building. Minh was reported to be mortified when he realised that Diệm and Nhu had escaped during the night.|$|E
5|$|As Wing Commander Kellett {{was taking}} off, Schumacher was dismissing <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> that the British would attempt a bombing raid in clear weather. On {{the island of}} Wangerooge, Leutnant Hermann Diehl of Regiment 3, battery LN-Vers was demonstrating the Freya set to a visiting naval officer. Diehl was using Falck's 2./ZG 76 to test the set. After some demonstration, he swung the set north, {{pointing}} to the Heliogoland Bight. As soon {{as he did so}} he picked up an echo. He telephoned Schumacher's Geschwader at Jever. They were told that the naval radar reported nothing, and that it was ridiculous to think the British would attack in such clear skies. Diehl spoke to von Bülow-Bothkamp. No one wanted to know. Some 20 minutes later, naval Freyas also picked up the formation, but still no fighters were scrambled. German radar was just as efficient as its British counterpart, the problem lay in communication. The British married their radar to an efficient fighter control system. The Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine had poor communication and their areas of responsibility overlapped, creating confusion over who was responsible. Added to this was the German disbelief that RAF Bomber Command would expose itself on a day when conditions favoured the fighter. Only when observers on the ground confirmed that the formation existed were fighters scrambled. The observers described a formation of 44 British aircraft, twice its actual strength.|$|E
5|$|While {{talking about}} Chris's {{situation}} with Lois, Peter is suddenly {{confronted by the}} Giant Chicken. This is the third fight between the two. Their epic battle ranges from the Griffin house, through the sewers, onto a subway train, over the girders of a high-rise construction site, and then up into a biplane, crashing into a giant Ferris wheel, which is dislodged from its platform and rolls through the streets. The fight continues atop the rolling wheel until it demolishes a ten-story apartment building. Emerging from the wreckage, Peter and the Chicken realize that neither has <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> what they are fighting about. They apologize to each other, and the Chicken invites Peter to join him and his wife, Nicole, for dinner. At the restaurant, the three have just finished a lovely meal when the check arrives, and both Peter and the Chicken (named Ernie) insists on paying the tab--Peter insists on paying since his order was kind of expensive while Ernie insists on paying {{as a way of}} apologizing to Peter. As they face off, the fight resumes and leads them into the restaurant kitchen. Peter subdues Ernie with a pot of boiling water and beats him unconscious. Peter staggers home, and back in the kitchen, Ernie lies lifeless on the floor, but in a sudden close-up, Ernie's left eye opens as dramatic music plays, foreshadowing another chicken fight. Peter goes home and resumes his conversation with Lois.|$|E
