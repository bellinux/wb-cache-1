25|$|Clone {{phishing}} {{is a type}} of {{phishing attack}} whereby a legitimate, and previously delivered, email containing an <b>attachment</b> or <b>link</b> has had its content and recipient address(es) taken and used to create an almost identical or cloned email.

It may claim to be a resend of the original or an updated version to the original. This technique could be used to pivot (indirectly) from a previously infected machine and gain a foothold on another machine, by exploiting the social trust associated with the inferred connection due to both parties receiving the original email.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{associations}} among women’s emotional and cognitive responses to infant fear and anger and to identify <b>attachment</b> <b>linked</b> predictors of these responses. Four hundred and forty Caucasian and African American undergraduate college women viewed video clips of two crying infants, one displaying anger and the other displaying fear. They identified what the infants were feeling, made causal attributions about the cause of crying, rated their own emotional reactions to the crying infants, and reported on the extent to which their parents met their emotional needs in childhood and their current adult attachment patterns. Emotional and cognitive responses to infant fear and anger were interrelated. Consistent with prediction, a history of parental emotional rejection and adult attachment anxiety and avoidance correlated negatively with accurate identification of emotions and positively with negative attributions, amusement, and neutral responses to infant distress. Adult attachment security moderated the effects of early parental rejection on emotional and cognitive responses to infant distress, and these results varied based on race and parent gender.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{theoretical}} work is {{to assess}} {{the relation between the}} capacity to experiment positive emotions and the process of resilience throughout childhood. Our interest arises from two research works being carried out in the province of Mendoza, in Argentina (INCIHUSA-CRICYT-CONICET), directed by Dr Mirta Ison. One the so called “Assessment of resilience in childhood maltreatment”, and the other “ Positive emotions as psycological tools for fostering mental health throughout childhood within vulnerable social contexts”. Resilience is always associated to risky or vulnerable social situations.   Positive emotions constitute a resource favorable to the development of resilience. This working hypothesis is based on previous studies which hold that positive emotions favor creative thinking for the solution of interpersonal problems, promote cognitive flexibility, reduce risks at decision making, promote replies to generosity and altruism, increase intelectual resources and counteract depressive tendencies among others. Other authors support the fact that the features a resilient child holds are closely connected to cognitive flexibility, to creative capacity, to the capacity for solving interpersonal problems, to self esteem and <b>attachment</b> <b>links</b> among others. Thus, positive emotions are believed {{to be one of the}} psycological resources and tools needed for the development of resilience throughout childhood.   </div...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} model for growing {{networks}} based on a finite memory of the nodes. The model shows stylized features of real-world networks: power law distribution of degree, linear preferential <b>attachment</b> of new <b>links</b> and a negative correlation between the age of a node and its <b>link</b> <b>attachment</b> rate. Notably, the degree distribution is conserved even though only the most recently grown part of the network is considered. This feature is relevant because real-world networks truncated {{in the same way}} exhibit a power-law distribution in the degree. As the network grows, the clustering reaches an asymptotic value larger than for regular lattices of the same average connectivity. These high-clustering scale-free networks indicate that memory effects could be crucial for a correct description of the dynamics of growing networks. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|The cuticle {{is a major}} barrier {{prohibiting the}} {{infection}} of nematodes against micro-organisms. The attachment of bacterial spores of the nematode hyperparasite Pasteuria penetrans (PPI) to field populations of root-knot nematodes (RKN, Meloidogyne spp.) from Burkino Faso, Ecuador, Greece, Malawi. Senegal and Trinidad and Tobago were assayed in standard attachment tests. The attachment of spore population PP 1 to different field populations of root-knot nematode showed that the rates of attachment differed between countries. Similar tests were also undertaken on f. penetrans spores from these countries against 2 species of RKN, M. incognita and M. arenaria. The results show ed {{a high degree of}} variability in spore attachment with no clear distinction between the 2 species of nematode.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The spinal dura is {{anchored}} within the vertebral canal by connective {{tissue in the}} epidural space {{as well as the}} spinal roots. Inadvertent disruption of these dural attachments may lead to durotomy and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks. We observed well-developed connective tissue ligaments connecting the lumbar dura to the spinal column and examined these tissues microscopically. METHODS: Intraoperative images were obtained during lumbar laminectomy procedures. They demonstrated connective tissue <b>attachments,</b> <b>linking</b> the lumbar dura to the spinal column in the dorsal midline and dorsolaterally. Tissue samples were obtained and examined microscopically. We then conducted a search of the literature to find references to dural attachments to the spinal column. RESULTS: Histological examination of the samples showed minimal cellular fibrous tissue. To date no references to these attachments have been made in neurosurgical literature. Previous studies, including live, cadaveric, and radiographic examinations, have demonstrated a dorsomedian fold of dura attached to the junction of the ligamentum flavum, and dorsolateral ligaments that divide the dorsal epidural space into an anterior and posterior compartment. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural fibrous connections or ligaments between the dura and the lumbar spinal column may be of clinical importance to the neurosurgeon. Care should be taken during lumbar procedures not to disrupt or tear these ligaments as this may cause dural tears and CSF leaks. Identifying these ligaments and cutting them sharply may prevent inadvertent durotomies...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{networks}} {{describe a}} wide range of systems and structures in the world. Any real network can be modeled as graph, expressed by an adjacency matrix or list. In many complex networks, when a graph of a certain type grows in size, its properties are expected to change. Each complex network presents specific topological features which characterize its individual properties and are influenced by the dynamics of processes executed on the network. The analysis of complex networks therefore relies on the use of measurements capable of expressing the most relevant topological features. Therefore, understanding and analyzing the properties of different sized graphs is a challenging topic in the research field. The objective of the thesis is to understand the evolving properties of growing networks. Therefore it focuses on comparison of topological metrics with different number of nodes and links. Growing graphs will be approached by two different schemes: preferential <b>link</b> <b>attachment</b> and random <b>link</b> <b>attachment.</b> Several common types of graph models are involved in the thesis. And we also consider different real-world network examples. With the analysis and comparison of numerical simulation results, we want to understand the changing tendency of topological metrics for evolving networks. In final, the thesis reveals different crucial factors affecting the evolving properties of growing network and concludes evolving properties based on both empirical and analytical results.

40|$|In {{this review}} article, we outline the {{evidence}} <b>linking</b> <b>attachment</b> adversity to psychosis, from the premorbid {{stages of the}} disorder to its clinical forms. To better understand the neurobiological mechanisms through which insecure attachment may contribute to psychosis, we identify at least five neurobiological pathways <b>linking</b> <b>attachment</b> to risk for developing psychosis. Besides its well documented influence on the hypothalamic-pituary-adrenal (HPA) axis, insecure attachment may also contribute to neurodevelopmental risk through the dopaminergic and oxytonergic systems, as well as bear influence on neuroinflammation and oxidative stress responses. We further consider the neuroscientific and behavioral studies that underpin mentalization as a suite of processes potentially moderating the risk to transition to psychotic disorders. In particular, mentalization may help the individual compensate for endophenotypical impairments in the integration of sensory and metacognitive information. We propose a model where embodied mentalization would lie {{at the core of}} a protective, resilience response mitigating the adverse and potentially pathological influence of the neurodevelopmental cascade of risk for psychosis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStereocilin is {{defective}} in a recessive form of deafness, DFNB 16. We {{studied the}} distribution of stereocilin in the developing and mature mouse inner ear and analyzed the consequences of its absence in stereocilin-null (Strc(-/-)) mice that suffer hearing loss starting at postnatal day 15 (P 15) and progressing until P 60. Using immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy, stereocilin was detected in association with two cell surface specializations specific to outer hair cells (OHCs) in the mature cochlea: the horizontal top connectors that join the apical regions of adjacent stereocilia within the hair bundle, and the <b>attachment</b> <b>links</b> that attach the tallest stereocilia to the overlying tectorial membrane. Stereocilin was also detected around the kinocilium of vestibular hair cells and immature OHCs. In Strc(-/-) mice the OHC hair bundle was structurally and functionally normal until P 9. Top connectors, however, did not form and the cohesiveness of the OHC hair bundle progressively deteriorated from P 10. The stereocilia were still interconnected by tip links at P 14, but these progressively disappeared from P 15. By P 60 the stereocilia, still arranged in a V-shaped bundle, were fully disconnected from each other. Stereocilia imprints on the lower surface of the tectorial membrane were also not observed in Strc(-/-) mice, thus indicating that {{the tips of the}} tallest stereocilia failed to be embedded in this gel. We conclude that stereocilin is essential to the formation of horizontal top connectors. We propose that these links, which maintain the cohesiveness of the mature OHC hair bundle, are required for tip-link turnover...|$|R
