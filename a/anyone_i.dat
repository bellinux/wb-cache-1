In Branco's opinion, the push toward the storyline was the reason Howarth eventually left OLTL for As the World Turns. By contrast, at a fan gathering in 2008, St. John joked about Todd and Marty bonding during the Carlivati storyline, stating, [...] "I'm all for gang rape."

500|$|Enid Blyton {{was born}} on 11 August 1897 in East Dulwich, South London, the eldest of three children, to Thomas Carey Blyton (1870–1920), a cutlery salesman, and his wife Theresa Mary ( [...] Harrison; 1874–1950). Enid's younger brothers, Hanly (1899–1983) and Carey (1902–1976), were born after the family had moved to a semi-detached villa in Beckenham, then a village in Kent. A few months after her birth Enid almost died from {{whooping}} cough, but was nursed back to health by her father, whom she adored. Thomas Blyton ignited Enid's interest in nature; in her autobiography she wrote that he [...] "loved flowers and birds and wild animals, and knew more about them than <b>anyone</b> <b>I</b> had ever met". He also passed on his interest in gardening, art, music, literature and the theatre, and the pair often went on nature walks, much to the disapproval of Enid's mother, who showed little interest in her daughter's pursuits. Enid was devastated {{when he left the}} family shortly after her thirteenth birthday to live with another woman. Enid and her mother did not have a good relationship, and she did not attend either of her parents' funerals.|$|E

I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team."

It was subsequently reported that the teams had only been given the option of retaining the elimination format or adopting a hybrid of the elimination and pre-2016 formats, and that an outright reversion to the 2006-2015 format was never discussed. Mercedes' motorsport director Toto Wolff remained adamant that the format needed to be reverted, saying that he did not expect qualifying to be more entertaining than it had been two weeks before. Drivers were equally critical of the retention of the changed format: Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel told the press that he was [...] "as disappointed as probably <b>anyone</b> <b>I</b> know", while Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton called the decision [...] "strange , particularly because {{the most important thing is}} the fans were unhappy".

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{was directed by}} Carey's husband, Nick Cannon.

In the back of my mind, I felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey before I even put out my album.’ Then, when it came out, I think it was the #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you in that. I feel like she liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But I told her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E

500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to <b>anyone.</b> <b>I</b> can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E
