Martin and Hewlett have since spoken negatively of their experiences creating the film. Talalay blamed some of the film's negative reception on studio edits over which she had no control. Despite the negative critical reception and box office failure of the film, it has been cited <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comic book film with a cult following, and it is noted for its feminist themes.|$|E

5|$|In his Poetics, Aristotle {{points to}} the ″voice of the shuttle″ in Sophocles′ tragedy Tereus <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> poetic device that aids in the ″recognition″—the change from ignorance to knowledge—of what has {{happened}} earlier in the plot. Such a device, according to Aristotle, is ″contrived″ by the poet, and thus is ″inartistic.″. The connection between the nightingale's song and poetry is evoked by Aristophanes in his comedy The Birds and in the poetry of Callimachus. Roman poet Virgil compares the mourning of Orpheus for Eurydice to the “lament of the nightingale”.|$|E
5|$|Rocco Landesman, {{chairperson}} of the National Endowment for the Arts, has used Citygarden <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful foundation-funded art venture. Landesman—a former resident of St. Louis—said that such projects can help urban areas economically, but they cannot be funded solely by the federal government, thus requiring assistance from both {{the private sector and}} foundations. Michael Van Valkenburgh, principal of a Brooklyn landscape architecture firm, said he was drawn to St. Louis partly because of Citygarden's design and success. Van Valkenburgh was selected in 2010 to renovate the grounds of the Gateway Arch.|$|E
5|$|The Fire Station Number 4 is architecturally {{significant}} <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> late 19th-century Queen Anne-style firehouse.

The boundary for the property is listed as Plat 7B, lot 164 and includes the surrounding area, totaling less than one acre. Fire Station Number 4 was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 18, 1983.|$|E

5|$|The Petition {{caused a}} flurry of {{broadside}} satires, poems and ballads on the subject through the following year. The historian James Turner identifies this event <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new carnivalisation of sexuality in Restoration England, where genuine political attack, satire, street commentary and bawdy theatre came together. Two years after the riots, a mob gathered once more and again swore they would raze Cresswell's cathouse to the ground, though protection from the local beadles prevented the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} Chaoyong was advertised by its designer, British naval {{architect}} Sir George Wightwick Rendel, <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> low-cost cruiser {{able to withstand}} larger ironclad warships. The design was later seen as an intermediate concept between his flat-iron gunboats and the protected cruiser. In theory, the ship would rely on its small size and higher speed, along with a higher muzzle velocity main battery to attack larger, less maneuverable ships.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus is {{regarded}} as senior synonym of the genera Creosaurus, Epanterias, and Labrosaurus. Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of A. fragilis, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is Labrosaurus ferox, named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is now regarded <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> fragilis.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{life was}} {{depicted}} {{in a series}} of contemporary illustrations sketched and water-coloured by the chronicler Matthew Paris, mostly drawn in the margins of the Chronica majora. Paris first met Henry in 1236 and enjoyed an extended relationship with the King, although Paris disliked many of Henry's actions and the illustrations are frequently unflattering. Henry was also shown in the poetry of his Italian contemporary Dante, who depicted Henry in the Divine Comedy <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> negligent ruler, sitting alone in Purgatory {{to one side of the}} other failed kings. It is unclear why he is shown separately from his contemporaries; possible explanations include that this is a code by Dante to show that England was not part of the Holy Roman Empire, or that it is a favourable comment on Henry himself, highlighting his unusual piety. Unlike many other medieval kings, Henry did not feature significantly in the works of William Shakespeare, and in the modern period he has not been a prominent subject for films, theatre or television, having only a minimal role in modern popular culture.|$|E
5|$|In November 1947, {{he made a}} {{surprise}} move to Third Division South club Notts County for a British record transfer fee of £20,000. He helped the club to win promotion as champions in 1949–50, before {{he moved on to}} Brentford in March 1952 for a club record £16,000. In January 1953, Brentford appointed him player-manager, though he would only remain in charge for nine months. He joined Arsenal as a player in November 1953 for £10,000, where he saw out the remainder of his playing career. He had a promising start to his managerial career by leading Kettering Town to the Southern League title in 1956–57, but then only had two more seasons as manager, getting relegated with Notts County in 1957–58 and then relegated with Kettering Town in 1963–64. During the 1970s he struggled with debt and related legal problems, which were reported in the media <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> celebrated person having fallen from grace.|$|E
5|$|On 20 April 2005, the Norwegian Ski Federation's board supported, with 13 against 1 vote, {{to build}} both a normal {{and a large}} hill at Rødkleiva and to close Vikersundbakken. However, the {{following}} day Svarstad Haugland stated that the government supported keeping Vikersundbakken rather than building a new venue in Rødkleiva. Clas Brede Bråthen responded that the federation hoped to build the venue with grants from the private sector, such as naming rights, and used Color Line Stadion in Ålesund <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> venue that had generated significant funding from corporate sponsors. A majority of the county chapters supported Vikersundbakken, with only 4 of 19 chapters supporting Rødkleiva. The Norwegian Ski Federation's national convention voted on 28 May with a large majority to place first a normal hill and then a ski flying hill at Rødkleiva.|$|E

5|$|Rosenborg started laying {{plans for}} further {{construction}}, at first looking at {{construction of a}} new grandstand on the east end. In May 1998, Lerkendal Eiendom AS, owned 44% by Rosenborg, was established to build three new grandstands, including removing the running track to make it a football-only stadium. An alternative was to move and build an all-new stadium at Ranheim. Following the announcement of the Ranheim plans, Mayor Anne Kathrine Slungård stated that {{she did not want to}} sell Lerkendal, as she wanted public ownership of cultural infrastructure. In April 1999, Trondheim Municipality's chief of administration, Knut Sæther, recommended that the municipality sell Lerkendal to Rosenborg, who would then along with private investors be free to construct the necessary facilities. At the time, the municipality estimated the value of Lerkendal to between NOK50 and 100 million. The football district stated they were in favor of conversion of Lerkendal, and that they feared that if Rosenborg moved Lerkendal would incur high costs on the municipality, giving Granåsen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> little used skiing facility which used half the municipal funding for sports venues.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are {{commonly}} cited <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> keystone species; because, they limit {{the density of}} sea urchins that feed on kelp. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure. Hunting of sea otters, for example, {{is thought to have}} led indirectly to the extinction of the Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas). While the keystone species concept has been used extensively as a conservation tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that keystone species may not be common, so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be applied.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{members of}} Giraffidae {{first appeared in}} the Early Miocene in Africa, having diverged from the superficially deer-like climacoceratids. Giraffids spread into Europe and Asia by the middle Miocene in a first radiation. Another radiation began in the Pliocene but was terminated by a decline in diversity in the Pleistocene. Several important primitive giraffids existed more or less contemporaneously in the Miocene (23-10 million years ago), including Canthumeryx, Giraffokeryx, Palaeotragus and Samotherium. According to palaeontologist and author Kathleen Hunt, Samotherium split into Okapia (18 million years ago) and Giraffa (12 million years ago). However, another author J. D. Skinner argued that Canthumeryx gave rise to the okapi and giraffe through the latter three genera and that the okapi is the extant form of Palaeotragus. The okapi is sometimes referred to <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> living fossil, as it has existed as a species over a long geological time period, and morphologically resembles more primitive forms (e.g. Samotherium).|$|E
