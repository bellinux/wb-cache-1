5|$|By early April 1917, there {{remained}} three German-held outpost villages—Boursies, Demicourt and Hermies—between {{the area}} {{to the south of}} the I Anzac Corps position and the Hindenburg Line.

5|$|During {{the years}} {{preceding}} {{the siege of}} Venice, {{it was believed that}} the Ottoman Empire had preparations underway to attack Malta. This suspicion became stronger when a well-groomed man, who had approached the Order to serve as engineer and offer his wealth of knowledge about fortifications, disappeared shortly after having surveyed Malta's fortifications. Consequently, the Order began its preparations to counter any possible <b>attack</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman army.|$|E

5|$|General Walker and the Eighth Army began {{preparing}} a counteroffensive, the first {{conducted by the}} UN in the war, for 6 August. It would kick off with an <b>attack</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> U.S. reserve units on the Masan area to secure Chinju from the North Korean 6th Division, followed by a larger general push to the Kum River {{in the middle of}} the month. One of Walker's goals was to break up a suspected massing of North Korean troops near Taegu by forcing the diversion of some North Korean units southward. On 6 August, the Eighth Army issued the operational directive for the <b>attack</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> task force. The plan of attack was to move west from positions held near Masan, seize the Chinju Pass, and secure the line as far as the Nam River, and depended on the arrival of the entire U.S. 2nd Infantry Division, as well as three more battalions of American tanks which were en route from the United States.|$|E
