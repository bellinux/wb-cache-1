25|$|The islands' {{physical}} characteristics <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of mountain-forming and volcanic forces that occurred between 60 and 70 million years ago, {{typical of many}} of the islands of Macaronesia. The islands were created during the late Miocene period, from a large submarine volcano and shaped by erosion and marine sedimentation. The larger islands and islet (Grande, Pequena and Fora, respectively) are the remnants of the peaks of these submarine mounts, and although located north of the Canaries, they were never connected to the African continent. The islands themselves are crossed by many calcareous faults, some marbleized, and made of basaltic rock, ash, and other volcanic materials. On many of the islands there are remnants of extinct cones, such as Atalaia (Selvagem Grande), Tornozelos and Veado. Other areas are sand covered from extensive aeolian, fluvial and marine erosion; headlands include Atalaia and Leste on Selvagem Grande, and Norte, Oeste, Leste and Garajaus on Selvagem Pequena.|$|E

500|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica ( [...] ), is a {{skeletal}} disorder {{resulting in}} a loss of bone mass, a weakening of the bones as their calcified supporting structures are replaced with fibrous tissue (peritrabecular fibrosis), and the formation of cyst-like brown tumors in and around the bone. Osteitis fibrosis cystica, abbreviated OFC, also known as osteitis fibrosa, osteodystrophia fibrosa, and von Recklinghausen's disease of bone (not to be confused with von Recklinghausen's disease, neurofibromatosis type I), is caused by hyperparathyroidism, which is a surplus of parathyroid hormone from over-active parathyroid glands. This surplus stimulates the activity of osteoclasts, cells that break down bone, in a process known as osteoclastic bone resorption. The hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by a parathyroid adenoma, hereditary factors, parathyroid carcinoma, or renal osteodystrophy. Osteoclastic bone resorption releases minerals, including calcium, from the bone into the bloodstream, causing both elevated blood calcium levels, and the structural changes which weaken the bone. The symptoms of the disease <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of both the general softening of the bones and the excess calcium in the blood, and include bone fractures, kidney stones, nausea, moth-eaten appearance in the bones, appetite loss, and weight loss.|$|E

He was critical of fathers who do not fulfill this role: [...] "We have dads today that are interested in sports, business, and sex. They've forgotten their God-given assignments to teach the Ten Commandments [...]" [...] He {{went on to say that}} social problems, such as gun violence, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of fathers avoiding this responsibility.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, if {{a person}} has several options, you can {{calculate}} the opportunity cost of choosing one. But can we calculate a universal opportunity cost, which would include all the options? The prevailing opinion was that the opportunity cost could not be applied outside of cases of limited resources. This led some economists to limit the object of economics to [...] "exceptional" [...] resource situations (an idea still present in all economics textbooks).

These laws and this system <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of a {{fundamental}} reality grasped by the novelists, which Girard called [...] "the mimetic character of desire." [...] This is {{the content of}} his first book, Deceit, Desire and the Novel (1961). We borrow our desires from others. Far from being autonomous, our desire for a certain object is always provoked by the desire of another person—the model—for this same object. This means {{that the relationship between}} the subject and the object is not direct: there is always a triangular relationship of subject, model, and object. Through the object, one is drawn to the model, whom Girard calls the mediator: it is in fact the model who is sought. Girard calls desire [...] "metaphysical" [...] in the measure that, as soon as a desire is something more than a simple need or appetite, [...] "all desire is a desire to be", it is an aspiration, the dream of a fullness attributed to the mediator.|$|E

Clean platina, {{by which}} I mean such {{as has been}} made the {{positive}} pole of a pile (570.), or has been treated with acid (605.), and has then been put into distilled water for twelve or fifteen minutes, has a peculiar friction when one piece is rubbed against another. It wets freely with pure water, even {{after it has been}} shaken and dried by the heat of a spirit-lamp; and if made the pole of a voltaic pile in a dilute acid, it evolves minute bubbles from every part of its surface. But platina in its common state wants that peculiar friction: it will not wet freely with water as the clean platina does; and when made the positive pole of a pile, it for a time gives off large bubbles, which seem to cling or adhere to the metal, and are evolved at distinct and separate points of the surface.
