5|$|Academic {{criticism}} of Inseminoid has {{concentrated on the}} film's treatment of the female sex and female sexualities {{in the context of}} corruption by an alien source. In addition to its depiction of the abject Sandy, who is rendered a distorted Other in the aftermath of her unnatural impregnation, the film has been seen to incorporate <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> the patriarchal and the maternal towards its climax, as the new mother kills her former friends one by one. Complementing the film's successful VHS run, a novelisation of Inseminoid was written by Larry Miller.|$|E
5|$|The {{third season}} sparked controversy, namely Mel B's {{attitude}} towards the other judges, labeling them dishonest and boring. Controversy also occurred between Sebastian and contestant Mitchell Callaway; Sebastian took aim at Callaway's attitude to the competition following his performance on the third live performance show. There were also claims of <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> Callaway and contestant Declan Sykes. The grand final decider was watched by 1.99 million people, making it the highest rated television episode of the season.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at Painted Springs, Dr. Steven Monroe witnesses <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> sheep herders and cattle breeders. As Monroe starts {{to investigate the}} cause of the conflict, he finds out about Fred Burns' diabolical scheme– he intends to steal John Richards' cattle and frame sheep rancher Ed Gordon for the deed. After a series of fights, during which Burns and his men kidnap Richards' daughter Nancy, Monroe rescues Nancy and manages to get Burns to confess. With his evil intentions revealed, the two camps cease battling, and Monroe quietly leaves Painted Springs.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> local Torajan {{leaders and}} the South Sulawesi provincial {{government}} (as a tourist developer) broke out in 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages and burial sites as traditional tourist attractions. Consequently, zoning restrictions were applied to these areas, such that Torajans themselves were barred from changing their tongkonans and burial sites. The plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as they felt that their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders. As a result, in 1987, the Torajan village of Kété Kesú and several other designated tourist attractions closed their doors to tourists. This closure lasted only a few days, as the villagers found it too difficult to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|Free {{from their}} loyalties to the pharaoh, local rulers began {{competing}} {{with each other}} for territorial control and political power. By 2160BC, rulers in Herakleopolis controlled Lower Egypt in the north, while a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family, took control of Upper Egypt in the south. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055BC the northern Theban forces under Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands. They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the Middle Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the same}} day Haldane ordered US 1/28th Battalion to closely explore the tunnels in their area of operations, {{uncovering}} a number chambers and trapdoors defended by grenades and booby traps. A Company subsequently located another tunnel system after an American {{was killed by a}} Viet Cong soldier who suddenly appeared out of a large anthill. Later, as the 1/503rd continued to search its area with platoon-size patrols during the afternoon of 13 January, <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> Company C and a Viet Cong platoon developed into a heavy contact. An air-strike was successfully called in by the Americans however, and a search of the area recovered 10 dead Viet Cong, while blood trails and human remains indicated that perhaps another 20 were also killed.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} the facility, some of the prisoners were {{selected}} for beatings or execution.

One surviving prisoner later reported that he witnessed the killing of one prisoner in the camp itself, when Serbian paramilitaries slit the victim's throat in front of detainees. Other prisoners were beaten during interrogations, were shot and wounded, or were otherwise abused. On 19 November, gradual transfer of the detainees to Sremska Mitrovica prison in Serbia started. These transfers caused <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> Vujić and the Croatian Serb TO, as the latter wanted to keep the detainees under their control.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetically, {{the game}} used Fire Emblem {{elements}} as motifs, but took its setting and premise of <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> worlds from Shin Megami Tensei. The battle system was originally {{going to be}} similar to a Fire Emblem game, but while it did incorporate elements such as the Weapon Triangle, it ultimately became a turn-based RPG battle system. After Atlus was made primary developer, the story was set in modern-day Tokyo and written around a group of young people facing challenges together. Its upbeat focus on character drama was a deliberate shift away from the dark scenarios of the Megami Tensei series. The game takes place in multiple locations around Tokyo, including Shibuya and Harajuku. The modern setting provided challenges for incorporating Fire Emblem characters, as characters in medieval armor just dropping into a modern setting would have looked strange. Among the considered possibilities were introducing Fire Emblem characters as human party members. In the end, it was decided to make them summoned helpers similar to the demons of Shin Megami Tensei, drawn into the real world from their Idolosphere dimension.|$|E

5|$|Aged 17, Brooks swam 51.91s in Perth in January 1980, {{breaking}} Tonelli's Australian {{record in}} the 100m freestyle. As a result, {{he was invited to}} his first national training camp under Bill Sweetenham for prospective Olympic swimmers. He had the first of his many clashes with sporting administrators, first claiming that the officials did not want him to board with Tonelli's family and then stating that Sweetenham had only coached him two or three times, which he felt was insufficient. Brooks walked out of the camp and returned to Perth to train under Duff. At the Australian Championships, the 100m was seen as <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> Tonelli and Brooks. The latter came second in the 100m freestyle, outsprinted in the dying stages by Tonelli, who reclaimed his national record in a time of 51.80s. As a result, Brooks was selected in both the individual event and the 4100m medley relay.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{physical}} isolation, the islanders maintained a lively community. A school {{had been established}} in 1723 by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SPCK), with sixty children on its initial attendance roll. The demands of island life conflicted to some extent with those of schooling. The SPCK's inspector found only eighteen out of seventy pupils present when he visited in 1824. He found {{that many of the}} children were fully occupied helping their families in summer and only attended school in winter. Two places of worship were built within a couple of years of each other, a Baptist chapel in 1877 and a Church of Scotland church in 1878 (at a cost of £900). Although they soon became focal elements of community life, there seems to have been some bad blood between the two congregations, perhaps due to <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> the missionary zeal of local Baptists and the Calvinism of the Presbyterian Kirk.|$|E

As in the Prince of Wales's Stakes, Dettori settled Fantastic Light in the early stages before moving him out to challenge in the straight. Galileo had already taken the lead but Fantastic Light moved up and went level a furlong out. The two horses raced side-by-side for several strides, but Galileo then pulled ahead to win by two lengths.|$|E

5|$|On 25 January, <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> {{agitating}} {{students and}} Congress party workers in Madurai {{went out of}} control and became a riot. Rioting soon spread {{to other parts of the}} State. Police responded with lathi charges and firing on student processions. Acts of arson, looting and damage to public property became common. Railway cars and Hindi name boards at railway stations were burned down; telegraph poles were cut and railway tracks displaced. The Bhaktavatsalam Government considered the situation as a law and order problem and brought in para military forces to quell the agitation. Incensed by police action, violent mobs killed two police men. Several agitators committed suicide by self-immolation and by consuming poison. In two weeks of riots, around 70 people were killed (by official estimates). Some unofficial reports put the death toll as high as 500. A large number of students were arrested. The damage to property was assessed to be ten million rupees.|$|E
5|$|Scotland and Wales, {{having been}} drawn {{together}} in the same qualifying group for the 1986 World Cup, had been evenly matched throughout the competition, although Wales had secured a 1–0 win over Scotland in {{what turned out to be}} a controversial and bad-tempered game at Hampden Park in March 1985. This game, Wales' first win at Hampden for 34 years, saw Scottish complaints over what appeared to be a foul by Welsh striker Mark Hughes on defender Alex McLeish in the buildup to the goal scored by Ian Rush, and <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> Scotland captain Graeme Souness and Welsh midfielder Peter Nicholas, for which both were booked, and which led to a number of the Welsh team surrounding the Scottish player. This booking would prove expensive as Souness was subsequently booked in Scotland's next qualifying game against Iceland, which led to him being suspended for the final qualifying game away to Wales.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate {{back and forth from the}} doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E

5|$|While pre-dreadnoughts {{were adopted}} worldwide, {{there were no}} clashes between pre-dreadnought battleships {{until the very end}} of their period of dominance. The First Sino-Japanese War in 1894–95 {{influenced}} pre-dreadnought development, but this had been <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> Chinese battleships and a Japanese fleet consisting of mostly cruisers. The Spanish–American War of 1898 was also a mismatch, with the American pre-dreadnought fleet engaging Spanish cruisers. Not until the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 did pre-dreadnoughts engage on an equal footing. This happened in three battles: the Russian tactical victory during the Battle of Port Arthur on 8–9 February 1904, the indecisive Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August 1904, and the decisive Japanese victory at the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905. These battles upended prevailing theories of how naval battles would be fought, as the fleets began firing at one another at much greater distances than before; naval architects realized that plunging fire (explosive shells falling on their targets largely from above, instead of from a trajectory close to horizontal) was a much greater threat than had been thought.|$|E
5|$|A North Indian shopkeeper {{was killed}} in Bhandup, Mumbai after he refused to shut down his shop when MNS activists protesting Raj's arrest forced him to do so. Four persons were killed and another seriously injured in a village near Kalyan. Deputy {{commissioner}} of police (rural) Sanjay Shintre said two North Indians, {{a member of the}} Agri community and an MNS worker were killed in <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> the two communities in Pisavali, 10km from Kalyan. Earlier, curfew had been imposed in the entire Kalyan area. The situation in Kalyan worsened in the evening as Raj was driven there to a police station lock-up where he was to spend the night before being presented in a court on 22 October. Five outdoor broadcast vans belonging to media houses were damaged by MNS supporters. A cameraman from ETV was injured and had to be admitted to a private hospital. One Kalyan-Dombivli municipal transport bus was set on fire while five bikes were reduced to ashes. Transport services across Kalyan were paralysed. A jewellery shop was also ransacked by MNS supporters. In all one hundred and twenty-five cases of arson, rioting and stonepelting were registered across the state, including in Pune and Marathwada, by early evening, and 2,085 people were arrested, state director general of police A N Roy said.|$|E
5|$|Griffiths {{sought a}} {{historical}} origin for the Horus–Set rivalry, and he posited two distinct predynastic unifications of Egypt by Horus worshippers, similar to Sethe's theory, {{to account for}} it. Yet the issue remains unresolved, partly because other political associations for Horus and Set complicate the picture further. Before even Upper Egypt had a single ruler, two of its major cities were Nekhen, in the far south, and Naqada, many miles to the north. The rulers of Nekhen, where Horus was the patron deity, are generally believed to have unified Upper Egypt, including Naqada, under their sway. Set was associated with Naqada, so {{it is possible that}} the divine conflict dimly reflects an enmity between the cities in the distant past. Much later, at the end of the Second Dynasty (c. 2890–2686 BCE), King Peribsen used the Set animal in writing his serekh-name, in place of the traditional falcon hieroglyph representing Horus. His successor Khasekhemwy used both Horus and Set in the writing of his serekh. This evidence has prompted conjecture that the Second Dynasty saw <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>between</b> the followers of the Horus-king and the worshippers of Set led by Peribsen. Khasekhemwy's use of the two animal symbols would then represent the reconciliation of the two factions, as does the resolution of the myth.|$|E
