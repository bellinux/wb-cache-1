5|$|The {{cholesterol-lowering}} drugs, the statins, {{were initially}} produced by fungi including Penicillium. The first commercial statin, lovastatin, was fermented by the mould <b>Aspergillus</b> terreus.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} Spanish {{research}} study to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of mushrooms, Rhodotus palmatus was one of 204 species screened against a panel of human clinical pathogens and laboratory control strains. Using a standard laboratory method to determine antimicrobial susceptibility, the mushroom was shown to have moderate antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, and weak antifungal activity against both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and <b>Aspergillus</b> fumigatus.|$|E
5|$|Charles Thom (November 11, 1872 – May 24, 1956) was an American {{microbiologist}} and mycologist. Born {{and raised}} in Illinois, he received his PhD from the University of Missouri, the first such degree awarded by that institution. He was {{best known for his}} work on the microbiology of dairy products and soil fungi, and in particular his research into the genera <b>Aspergillus</b> and Penicillium. His work influenced the establishment of standards for food handling and processing in the USA. He pioneered the use of culture media to grow microorganisms, and, with food chemist James N. Currie, developed a process to mass-produce citric acid using <b>Aspergillus.</b> Thom {{played an important role in}} the development of penicillin in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Fungi {{affecting}} the roots include Nectria radicicola (Cylindrocarpon destructans), {{a cause of}} root rot and Rosellinia necatrix causing white root rot, while others affect root and bulb, such as <b>Aspergillus</b> niger (black mold), and species of Trichoderma, including T. viride and T. harzianum (=T. narcissi) responsible for green mold.|$|E
5|$|Penicillium moulds cause {{soft rot}} such as of apples, while <b>Aspergillus</b> moulds create patches {{on the surface}} of old bread, yoghurt and many other foods. Yeasts spoil sugary foods such as plums and jams, fermenting the sugars to alcohol. Scientific {{understanding}} of spoilage began in the 19th century with works such as Louis Pasteur's 1879 Studies on Fermentation, which investigated the spoilage of beer.|$|E
5|$|The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{has been}} an {{important}} model organism in modern cell biology for much of the twentieth century, {{and is one of the}} most thoroughly researched eukaryotic microorganisms. It was the first eukaryote whose genome was sequenced. In the twentyfirst century, the filamentous mould <b>Aspergillus</b> has been adopted for genome studies.|$|E
5|$|Thom's {{work with}} the food chemist James N. Currie in 1916–17 enabled them to develop a process to mass-produce citric acid using <b>Aspergillus,</b> {{and a few years}} later, the first {{large-scale}} mold fermentation factory had been established in Brooklyn, New York. This early work ultimately led to the Department of Agriculture's establishing four Regional Research Laboratories in 1938 that were devoted to industrial mold fermentations.|$|E
5|$|Various Cyathus {{species have}} {{antifungal}} activity against human pathogens such as <b>Aspergillus</b> fumigatus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Extracts of C.striatus have inhibitory effects on NF-κB, a transcription factor responsible for regulating {{the expression of}} several genes involved in the immune system, inflammation, and cell death.|$|E
5|$|Besides regular sexual {{reproduction}} with meiosis, certain fungi, {{such as those}} in the genera Penicillium and <b>Aspergillus,</b> may exchange genetic material via parasexual processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and plasmogamy of fungal cells. The frequency and relative importance of parasexual events is unclear and may be lower than other sexual processes. It is known {{to play a role in}} intraspecific hybridization and is likely required for hybridization between species, which has been associated with major events in fungal evolution.|$|E
5|$|Chromobacterium violaceum and Pseudomonas fluorescens {{can both}} {{mobilize}} solid copper as a cyanide compound. The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi associated with Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium can grow in metalliferous soils containing copper. The ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus protects young pine trees from copper toxicity. A {{sample of the}} fungus <b>Aspergillus</b> niger was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of such metals as gold, silver, copper, iron, and zinc. The fungus also {{plays a role in}} the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides.|$|E
5|$|Inflammatory {{conditions}} of the lung tissue are pneumonia, of the respiratory tract are bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and of the pleurae surrounding the lungs pleurisy. Inflammation is usually caused by infections due to bacteria or viruses. When the lung tissue is inflamed due to other causes it is called pneumonitis. One major cause of bacterial pneumonia is tuberculosis. Chronic infections often occur in those with immunodeficiency and can include a fungal infection by <b>Aspergillus</b> fumigatus {{that can lead to}} an aspergilloma forming in the lung.|$|E
5|$|Pathogenic fungi cause {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} in humans and livestock. Aspergillosis, most commonly caused by <b>Aspergillus</b> fumigatus, kills some 600,000 people per year, mostly those with already weakened immune systems. Pneumocystis causes pneumonia, again mainly in people with weakened immune systems. Candida yeasts are the agents of Candidiasis, causing infections of the mouth, throat, and genital tract, and more seriously of the blood. Ringworm is a skin infection that infects some 20% of the human population; it is caused by some 40 different fungi.|$|E
5|$|Some fungi {{can cause}} serious {{diseases}} in humans, several {{of which may}} be fatal if untreated. These include aspergillosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, mycetomas, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Furthermore, persons with immuno-deficiencies are particularly susceptible to disease by genera such as <b>Aspergillus,</b> Candida, Cryptoccocus, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis. Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin, the so-called dermatophytic and keratinophilic fungi, and cause local infections such as ringworm and athlete's foot. Fungal spores are also a cause of allergies, and fungi from different taxonomic groups can evoke allergic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Baker's yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a {{unicellular}} fungus, {{is used to}} make {{bread and}} other wheat-based products, such as pizza dough and dumplings. Yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces are also used to produce alcoholic beverages through fermentation. Shoyu koji mold (<b>Aspergillus</b> oryzae) is an essential ingredient in brewing Shoyu (soy sauce) and sake, and the preparation of miso, while Rhizopus species are used for making tempeh. Several of these fungi are domesticated species that were bred or selected according to their capacity to ferment food without producing harmful mycotoxins (see below), which are produced by very closely related Aspergilli. Quorn, a meat substitute, is made from Fusarium venenatum.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at the USDA, Thom became a world {{authority}} on the genera <b>Aspergillus</b> and Penicillium. Thom pioneered the technique of using defined, reproducible culture media to grow microorganisms; most of the taxa he described are still valid today. Together with Margaret B. Church, Thom maintained collections of fungus cultures for the American Type Culture Collection, established in 1925. In 1929, a year after discovering penicillin, Alexander Fleming published a well-known paper in which he identified the mold Penicillium rubrum as the one responsible for creating the drug. Harold Raistrick succeeded in growing the organism on a simple culture medium, but could not isolate the penicillin produced by the mold when grown this way. With Thom's assistance, they correctly identified the organism as Penicillium notatum and, in 1941, developed a method to scale up production at the Department of Agriculture's Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois, which ultimately resulted in an inexpensive supply of the drug.|$|E
5|$|Fungi create harm by spoiling food, {{destroying}} timber, and by causing {{diseases of}} crops, livestock, and humans. Fungi, mainly moulds like Penicillium and <b>Aspergillus,</b> spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause {{the majority of}} plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the Great Irish Famine of 1845–1849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by Phytophthora, result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi are similarly {{the main cause of}} economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; Aspergillosis kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened immune systems.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi produce biologically active compounds, {{several of}} which are toxic to animals or plants and are {{therefore}} called mycotoxins. Of particular relevance to humans are mycotoxins produced by molds causing food spoilage, and poisonous mushrooms (see above). Particularly infamous are the lethal amatoxins in some Amanita mushrooms, and ergot alkaloids, which {{have a long history}} of causing serious epidemics of ergotism (St Anthony's Fire) in people consuming rye or related cereals contaminated with sclerotia of the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea. Other notable mycotoxins include the aflatoxins, which are insidious liver toxins and highly carcinogenic metabolites produced by certain <b>Aspergillus</b> species often growing in or on grains and nuts consumed by humans, ochratoxins, patulin, and trichothecenes (e.g., T-2 mycotoxin) and fumonisins, which have significant impact on human food supplies or animal livestock.|$|E
5|$|Mould fungi are {{the source}} of the meaty (umami) flavour of the soybean {{products}} tempeh, miso and soy sauce. Tempeh has been produced in Java since the 13th century. Like tofu, it is made into protein-rich blocks, but these have a firm texture and earthy flavour, since (unlike tofu) the whole beans are retained, providing a higher content of dietary fibre and vitamins. Miso too is rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. It is fermented from a mixture of soybeans and cereals, forming a soft paste used to flavour soups and other Japanese dishes. Soy sauce has been used in China since the 2nd century AD, and is now widespread in Asia. Like miso, it is made by fermenting a mixture of soybeans and cereals with moulds such as <b>Aspergillus</b> oryzae.|$|E
5|$|Several pivotal {{discoveries in}} biology {{were made by}} {{researchers}} using fungi as model organisms, that is, fungi that grow and sexually reproduce rapidly in the laboratory. For example, the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis was formulated by scientists using the bread mold Neurospora crassa to test their biochemical theories. Other important model fungi are <b>Aspergillus</b> nidulans and the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, each of which {{with a long history}} of use to investigate issues in eukaryotic cell biology and genetics, such as cell cycle regulation, chromatin structure, and gene regulation. Other fungal models have more recently emerged that address specific biological questions relevant to medicine, plant pathology, and industrial uses; examples include Candida albicans, a dimorphic, opportunistic human pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea, a plant pathogen, and Pichia pastoris, a yeast widely used for eukaryotic protein production.|$|E
5|$|Several steroid {{derivatives}} {{have been}} isolated and identified from fruit bodies of L.perlatum, including (S)-23-hydroxylanostrol, ergosterol α-endoperoxide, ergosterol 9,11-dehydroendoperoxide and (23E)-lanosta-8,23-dien-3β,25-diol. The compounds 3-octanone, 1-octen-3-ol, and (Z)-3-octen-1-ol are the predominant {{components of the}} volatile chemicals that give the puffball its odor and flavor. Extracts of the puffball contain relatively high levels of antimicrobial activity against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with an efficiency {{comparable to that of}} the antibiotic ampicillin. These results corroborate an earlier study that additionally reported antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Extracts of the puffball have also been reported to have antifungal activity against Candida albicans, C.tropicalis, <b>Aspergillus</b> fumigatus, Alternaria solani, Botrytis cinerea, and Verticillium dahliae. A 2009 study found L.perlatum puffballs to contain the phenolic compound cinnamic acid at a concentration of about 14milligrams per kilogram of mushroom. The fruit bodies contain the pigment melanin.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{are less}} likely to be {{attacked}} by parasites than bees, wasps and ants, as they are usually well protected in their mounds. Nevertheless, termites are infected by a variety of parasites. Some of these include dipteran flies, Pyemotes mites, and a large number of nematode parasites. Most nematode parasites are in the order Rhabditida; others are in the genus Mermis, Diplogaster aerivora and Harteria gallinarum. Under imminent threat of an attack by parasites, a colony may migrate to a new location. Fungi pathogens such as <b>Aspergillus</b> nomius and Metarhizium anisopliae are, however, major threats to a termite colony as they are not host-specific and may infect large portions of the colony; transmission usually occurs via direct physical contact. M.anispliae is known to weaken the termite immune system. Infection with A.nomius only occurs when a colony is under great stress.|$|E
5|$|The Ascomycota, {{commonly}} known as sac fungi or ascomycetes, constitute the largest taxonomic group within the Eumycota. These fungi form meiotic spores called ascospores, which are enclosed in a special sac-like structure called an ascus. This phylum includes morels, a few mushrooms and truffles, unicellular yeasts (e.g., of the genera Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, and Candida), and many filamentous fungi living as saprotrophs, parasites, and mutualistic symbionts (e.g. lichens). Prominent and important genera of filamentous ascomycetes include <b>Aspergillus,</b> Penicillium, Fusarium, and Claviceps. Many ascomycete species have only been observed undergoing asexual reproduction (called anamorphic species), but analysis of molecular data has often been able to identify their closest teleomorphs in the Ascomycota. Because the products of meiosis are retained within the sac-like ascus, ascomycetes {{have been used for}} elucidating principles of genetics and heredity (e.g., Neurospora crassa).|$|E
25|$|The fungi <b>Aspergillus</b> flavus, <b>Aspergillus</b> fumigatus, <b>Aspergillus</b> niger, <b>Aspergillus</b> parasiticus, <b>Aspergillus</b> tamarii, <b>Aspergillus</b> sulphureus, <b>Aspergillus</b> repens, Mucor hiemalis (not a human pathogen), Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium italicum and Rhizopus nigrans {{have been}} found in moldy cannabis. <b>Aspergillus</b> mold species can infect the lungs via smoking or {{handling}} of infected cannabis and cause opportunistic and sometimes deadly aspergillosis. Some of the microorganisms found create aflatoxins, which are toxic and carcinogenic. Researchers suggest that moldy cannabis should thus be discarded to avoid these serious risks.|$|E
25|$|The fungus <b>Aspergillus</b> fumigatus {{effectively}} degrades plasticized PVC. Phanerochaete chrysosporium {{was grown}} on PVC in a mineral salt agar. Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Lentinus tigrinus, <b>Aspergillus</b> niger, and <b>Aspergillus</b> sydowii can effectively degrade PVC.|$|E
25|$|The fungus <b>Aspergillus</b> fumigatus {{effectively}} degrades plasticized PVC. Phanerochaete chrysosporium {{has been}} grown on PVC in a mineral salt agar. Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Lentinus tigrinus, <b>Aspergillus</b> niger, and <b>Aspergillus</b> sydowii can also effectively degrade PVC. Phanerochaete chrysosporium was grown on PVC in a mineral salt agar.|$|E
25|$|At least 14 {{different}} aflatoxins {{are produced}} in nature. Aflatoxin B1 {{is considered the}} most toxic and is produced by both <b>Aspergillus</b> flavus and <b>Aspergillus</b> parasiticus. Aflatoxin M1 {{is present in the}} fermentation broth of <b>Aspergillus</b> parasiticus, but it and aflatoxin M2 are also produced when an infected liver metabolizes aflatoxin B1 and B2.|$|E
25|$|The {{antifungal}} {{efficacy of}} copper {{was compared to}} aluminium on the following organisms that can cause human infections: <b>Aspergillus</b> spp., Fusarium spp., Penicillium chrysogenum, <b>Aspergillus</b> niger and Candida albicans. An increased die-off of fungal spores was found on copper surfaces compared with aluminium. <b>Aspergillus</b> niger growth occurred on the aluminium coupons; growth was inhibited on and around copper coupons.|$|E
25|$|Allergic bronchopulmonary {{aspergillosis}} (ABPA) is {{a condition}} characterised by an exaggerated response {{of the immune system}} (a hypersensitivity response) to the fungus <b>Aspergillus</b> (most commonly <b>Aspergillus</b> fumigatus). It occurs most often in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis. <b>Aspergillus</b> spores are ubiquitous in soil and are commonly found in the sputum of healthy individuals. A. fumigatus is responsible for a spectrum of lung diseases known as aspergilloses.|$|E
25|$|The colonial {{appearance}} of A.fulvescens generally mimics that of {{species in the}} genus Trichophyton and Chrysosporium while under the microscope the {{appearance of}} the organism resembles that of the genus <b>Aspergillus.</b> The differentiation of A.fulvescens from <b>Aspergillus</b> spp. is based on their conidial states.|$|E
25|$|Like {{other members}} of the genus <b>Aspergillus,</b> the A.ustus group is {{affiliated}} with the family Trichocomaceae. A phylogenetic study of <b>Aspergillus</b> section Usti using morphology, secondary metabolite chemistry and gene sequencing (beta-tubulin and calmodulin) revealed 21 distinct species and showed an affiliation of the section with two teleomorph genera, Emericella and Fennellia.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{and copper}} alloy {{surfaces}} have demonstrated a die-off of <b>Aspergillus</b> spp., Fusarium spp., Penicillium chrysogenum, <b>Aspergillus</b> niger and Candida albicans fungal spores. Hence, {{the potential to}} help {{prevent the spread of}} fungi that cause human infections by using copper alloys (instead of non-antifungal metals) in air conditioning systems is worthy of further investigation.|$|E
25|$|Several statin {{cholesterol-lowering}} drugs (such as lovastatin, from <b>Aspergillus</b> terreus) {{are derived}} from molds.|$|E
25|$|Aflatoxins are {{produced}} by both <b>Aspergillus</b> flavus and <b>Aspergillus</b> parasiticus, which are common forms of 'weedy' molds widespread in nature. The presence of those molds does not always indicate that harmful levels of aflatoxin are present, but does indicate a significant risk. The molds can colonize and contaminate food before harvest or during storage, especially following prolonged exposure to a high-humidity environment, or to stressful conditions such as drought.|$|E
25|$|As {{concentrations}} of <b>Aspergillus</b> proteases increase, the immunological effect switches from pro-inflammatory to inhibitory, and further reduces phagocytic ability to clear <b>Aspergillus.</b> Ultimately, repeated acute episodes lead to wider scale damage of pulmonary structures (parenchyma) and function via irreversible lung remodelling. Left untreated, this manifests as progressive bronchiectasis and pulmonary fibrosis {{that is often}} seen in the upper lobes, and can {{give rise to a}} similar radiological appearance to that produced by tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} {{involves}} exposing {{the skin to}} <b>Aspergillus</b> fumigatus antigens; an immediate reaction is hallmark of ABPA. The test should be performed first by skin prick testing, and if negative followed with an intradermal injection. Overall sensitivity of the procedure is around 90%, though up to 40% of asthmatic patients without ABPA can still show some sensitivity to <b>Aspergillus</b> antigens (a phenomenon likely linked to a less severe form of ABPA termed severe asthma with fungal sensitization (SAFS)).|$|E
25|$|Significant {{research}} is ongoing into fungal P450s, {{as a number}} of fungi are pathogenic to humans (such as Candida yeast and <b>Aspergillus)</b> and to plants.|$|E
