5|$|God is {{not lost}} to Eliezer entirely. During the hanging of a child, which the camp is forced to watch, he hears someone ask: Where is God? Where is he? Not heavy enough for {{the weight of his}} body to break his neck, the boy dies slowly. Wiesel files past him, sees his tongue still pink <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> clear.|$|E
5|$|Fellow revolutionary Panayot Hitov later {{described}} the adult Levski as being of medium height and having an agile, wiry appearance—with light, greyish-blue eyes, blond hair, {{and a small}} moustache. He added that Levski abstained from smoking and drinking. Hitov's memories of Levski's appearance are supported by Levski's contemporaries, revolutionary and writer Lyuben Karavelov and teacher Ivan Furnadzhiev. The only differences are that Karavelov claimed Levski was tall rather than of medium height, while Furnadzhiev noted that his moustache was light brown <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> appeared hazel.|$|E
5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup {{in order to get}} the right effect <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> were colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still, giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created a slice of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E

5|$|Quinton, {{a student}} at the school {{mentioned}} before, calls his father after he sees the legless beggar man in his room at night. His father tells him that it was his imagination, goes back downstairs, but then screams. Quinton rushes down to find his father dead <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> turned red with blood. Doggett and Scully investigate this latest death after the police tell them about the strange man the boy saw. While discussing the lack of any damage to the body except the broken blood vessels in the eyes, Scully comes {{to the conclusion that the}} man is still inside the latest victim. She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy’s father with a distended belly. She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the scalpel incision. After being temporarily knocked over, she follows a bloody trail, opens a door at the end of the trail, and finds no one there. Unbeknownst to her, however, the beggar is watching her.|$|E
25|$|The second work, {{with his}} body {{slightly}} turned aside <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> looking down, {{appears to be a}} sad young man. Even the angle of the hat seems to indicate sadness. Both museum paintings were made on large canvas, 65 x 54cm.|$|E

He was bound with duct tape <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> were gouged out. At the time of his death, he {{was having an affair with}} porn actress Rebecca Bliss. He was also the heir to a multi-million dollar estate.|$|E

25|$|As the {{conflict}} finally draws to a close, Estinien offers to seal away Nidhogg's eyes so their power {{could no longer}} be used for evil. However, Nidhogg's rage proves too great <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> overwhelm Estinien's psyche, possessing him and transfiguring his body into that of the great wyrm. With that, Nidhogg's shade escapes to rally his horde anew. Returning to Ishgard, the Warrior of Light receives a hero's welcome as Aymeric pledges to reconcile Ishgard's true past with the peace promised by the present. As Thordan's illegitimate son, he assumes temporary rule of Ishgard. Under this uneasy accord, Ishgard rejoins the Eorzean Alliance.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 February 1942, lookouts on Christmas Island spotted an object out at sea, which on closer inspection {{turned out to be}} a carley float carrying the body of a Caucasian man wearing a blue boilersuit that had been sun-bleached white. The flesh of his right arm had been eaten away by fish, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and nose consumed by birds. Shrapnel was embedded in the float's outer covering, while the proliferation of marine growth indicated that it had been adrift for some time. As the island was under threat of Japanese invasion, after a brief examination, the body was buried in an unmarked grave near Flying Fish Cove. Evacuation began on 17 February with Japanese forces occupying the island on 23 March.|$|E
25|$|Ed Harris did not {{actually}} breathe the fluid. He held his breath inside a helmet full of liquid while being towed 30 feet (10 m) {{below the surface of}} the large tank. He recalled that the worst moments were being towed with fluid rushing up his nose <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> swelling up. Actors played their scenes at 33 feet (11 m), too shallow a depth for them to need decompression, and rarely stayed down for more than an hour at a time. Cameron and the 26-person underwater diving crew sank to 50 feet (17 m) and stayed down for five hours at a time. To avoid decompression sickness, they would have to hang from hoses halfway up the tank for as long as two hours, breathing pure oxygen.|$|E

25|$|After the movie, {{as seen in}} , Cobra Commander {{is still}} in his snake form and kept as a pet by Serpentor. However, Baroness restores him partly to a semi-human form—through {{exposure}} to an ancient primordial energy called Dragonfire, which {{is the focal point}} of the first five episodes of the new series. The basic shape of his body is humanoid, his skin and features are reptilian and he retains a taste for flies that he catches with his prehensile tongue. His intellect is fully restored, and upon being outfitted with his battle armor, Cobra Commander once again appears to be a humanoid male. He regains control of Cobra, and even dispatches Serpentor, using the new found Dragonfire energy to turn him into an oversize iguana. Cobra Commander's inhuman origins are never mentioned again, and he is never shown to have reptilian features again. In Season 2, he resumes wearing his original cloth mask, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> appear to be completely human.|$|E
25|$|Goya depicts Saturn feasting {{upon one}} of his sons. His child's head {{and part of the}} left arm have already been consumed. The right arm has {{probably}} been eaten too, though it could be folded in front of the body and held in place by Saturn's thumbs. The titan is on the point of taking another bite from the left arm; as he looms from the darkness, his mouth gapes <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> bulge whitely. The only other brightness in the picture comes from the white flesh, the red blood of the corpse, the white knuckles of Saturn as he digs his fingers {{into the back of the}} body. There is evidence that the picture may have originally portrayed the titan with a partially erect penis, but, if ever present, this addition was lost due to the deterioration of the mural over time or during the transfer to canvas; in the picture today the area around his groin is indistinct. It may even have been overpainted deliberately before the picture was put on public display.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 1861, Chase and an aide, Captain Ebenezer Farrand, {{formerly}} {{second in}} command at the Pensacola Navy Yard, appeared at Fort Pickens to demand the surrender of the fort and garrison. Slemmer and his {{second in command}}, Second Lieutenant J. H. Gilman, met Chase outside the fort. Slemmer refused to allow Chase and Farrand in the fort, even though Chase said he had built the fort and would learn nothing from entering it. Slemmer replied that Chase {{did not know what}} preparations he had made and Chase proceeded to state his business. Lieutenant Gilman reported that Chase said he wanted to avoid bloodshed and that he had written his demand in proper form and would read it. Lieutenant Gilman reported that Chase's voice shook <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> filled with tears as he began his demand that the U.S. Army surrender Fort Pickens, a structure that he had designed and built as a captain with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Chase handed the paper to Farrand to read but Farrand could not see it well at night without his glasses so Gilman had to read it aloud.|$|E

25|$|In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Voldemort is {{initially}} only heard, possessing the scratchy, weak voice {{heard in the}} first film. By the film's climax, however, he appears in his physical form for the first time, played by Ralph Fiennes. As in the book, Voldemort is shown clad in dark black robes, being tall and emaciated, with no hair and yellowish teeth; his wand has a white tone and the handle appears {{to be made of}} bone; his finger nails are long and pale blue while his toe nails appear to be infected. Unlike in the book, his pupils are not cat-like <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> are blue, because producer David Heyman felt that his evil {{would not be able to}} be seen and would not fill the audience with fear (his eyes do briefly take on a snake-like appearance when he opens them after turning human, but quickly turn normal). As in the book, the film version of Voldemort has snake-like slit nostrils with the flesh of his nose significantly pressed back. Ralph Fiennes' nose was not covered in makeup on the set, but was digitally removed in post-production. In this first appearance, Voldemort also has a forked tongue, but this element was removed for the subsequent films.|$|E
500|$|Ellis {{admitted}} {{not being}} {{very familiar with}} the character, saying: [...] "All I remember of the Norman Osborn character was from the Spider-Man reprints my parents used to buy me when I was very young, and Norman Osborn was this guy with a weird rippled crewcut who was always sweating <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> were always bulging out of his head. That guy as a Donald Rumsfeld-like public governmental figure... talked me into writing the book while I was still laughing."" ...|$|E
500|$|While English {{newspapers}} suppressed {{mention of}} the Prince's name {{in association with the}} case, Welsh-language, colonial, and American newspapers were less inhibited. The New York Times ridiculed him as a [...] "dullard" [...] and [...] "stupid perverse boy", who would [...] "never be allowed to ascend the British throne". According to one American press report, when departing the Gare du Nord in Paris in May 1890, Albert Victor was cheered by a waiting crowd of English, but hissed and catcalled by some of the French; one journalist present asked him if he would comment [...] "as to the cause of his sudden departure from England". According to the report, [...] "The Prince's sallow face turned scarlet <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> seemed to start from their orbits," [...] and he had one of his companions upbraid the fellow for impertinence.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the performance, {{according}} to Ted Shaffrey, [...] "Before he emerged from the phone-booth sized contraption of clear plastic and steel, Angel yanked out the air hose that allowed him to breathe. Then assistants pulled a black curtain over the 220-gallon (832-liter) chamber to block the view of television cameras and about 100 people gathered outside the window in which he was displayed. Under cover, Angel apparently escaped from the shackles that bound his arms, legs and neck, before pulling himself from the watery chamber with a celebratory scream." [...] Upon successfully completing the trick, he was described as having [...] "skin crinkled <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> bloodshot", and upon emerging from the tank he was taken to St. Clare's Hospital and treated for severe dehydration. He reported afterwards that he had suffered from overheating, jaw fatigue, and semi-consciousness while in the tank.|$|E
500|$|... tall, slim boy, {{straight}} as an arrow. His {{face was a}} perfect oval, his hair was as black as a raven's wing, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> were large and of that peculiar soft, melting blackness, which excites pity when one is in distress. His skin was a clear, dark olive, bordering on the swarthy, and this, with his high cheek bones, would have led us to suppose that his nationality was different from our own, had we not known that his name was plain Henry P. There was an air of good breeding and refinement about him, that, with his small hands and feet, would have set us to thinking, {{had it not been}} that in our youth and intensely enthusiastic natures, we gave no thought to our comrades' personal appearance. We can look back now and see the shy, reserved nature of the boy, the dark, melancholy eyes, the sad smile, the sensitive twitching of the lips.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard's {{military}} career has attracted comment {{from a number}} of journalists and writers over the years. The claims made by the Church of Scientology were not challenged by some early writers; C.H. Rolph quoted without comment a 1968 Scientology biographical sketch circulated to British Members of Parliament in which Hubbard's war service was summarized, and in 1971 Paulette Cooper described as [...] "true" [...] the claim that Hubbard [...] "was severely injured in the war (and in fact was in a lifeboat for many days, badly injuring his body <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> in the hot Pacific sun)." [...] Others were more skeptical. George Malko attempted to verify Hubbard's [...] "revealing, anonymously authored, and totally unsubstantiated biography" [...] in 1970 but reported that [...] "I was unable to confirm a single one of [...] critical claims: that he had been crippled and blind, the nature of his 'discoveries,' and the medical records stating he had 'twice been pronounced dead.'" [...] His inquiries were frustrated by the Navy's refusal to provide Hubbard's service record [...] "without the written consent of the person whose records are concerned." ...|$|E
