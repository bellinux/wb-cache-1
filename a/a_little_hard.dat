500|$|After the races, {{there was}} {{continued}} discussion about overheating engines in high temperatures. Harvick said the temperatures of around [...] had affected the racing, [...] the grills were [...] "too tight" [...] and competitors chose {{to remain in}} a single-file formation because of overheating. Smith said he believed there was no efficient method of tackling the problem. McMurray advocated the widening of the grille, saying, [...] "it was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> to race because you got too hot". One day after the second race, NASCAR announced that no further changes would be made.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{of their}} {{strained}} relationship {{during an interview}} with Hot 97.5, Minaj said: [...] "It gets <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> {{to have a real}} connection when people are on different sides of the world, working on different things. You just never know who people got in their ear or what they're feeling or maybe they felt wronged in some way. I don't know. I just know that Drake is my baby, and Wayne is my everything." [...] However, Drake said their relationship has improved, and credited the song as opening up a new dialogue, saying: [...] "I think the dialogue actually between us was already opened up, I had already solved that issue. I wrote that a while ago, and I kinda felt guilty changing it. It was a sentiment that I had when I started this album and felt like that's how it should be. The album should start one place and end in another...I haven't talked to her since it's been out. I'm not sure. I haven't spoke to her." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "a solid example of the show’s mid-period form". However, {{he noted that the}} episode {{is not one of the}} series bests, unlike the way many fans portray it—due largely to the fact that [...] "it allows us to see what it would be like if Mulder and Scully were a happily married couple"—and that [...] "the episode’s monster is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> to figure out". Other reviews were more mixed. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a more mixed review, writing [...] "after {{watching}} 'Arcadia', I feel like I just had a couple slices of pizza for dinner on Thanksgiving. Not bad, but hardly the feast I have come to expect." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris, despite praising David Duchovny's performance during the scenes wherein he [...] "rebels against the rules", called the episode's main villains [...] "stereotypes of self-indulgent, insulated suburbanites." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon the video's release, several {{media outlets}} noticed a {{resemblance}} between the colorful aesthetics of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] {{and those of}} British singer-songwriter and rapper M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz". Melina Matsoukas responded to the allegations that she had copied the idea, and said, [...] "Afterward I was like, 'Oh, this sucks. They tore down my video... video's great too. It definitely wasn't trying to rip anybody off at all, it was just our approach and the animation stuff, it had a similar vibe." [...] Matsoukas explained that {{the inspiration for the}} video did not come from one particular source, but from a variety of pop culture icons. She concluded, [...] "We're all inspired by similar elements and it came together in that way." [...] Several critics noticed the differences between Rihanna's previous singles, [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "Hard", and that [...] "Rude Boy" [...] had adopted a care-free and brighter image. Becky Bain of Idolator also noticed the similarities between M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy", and wrote, [...] "We're digging the reggae-inflected jam, although the Bob Marley-meets-M.I.A. color explosion becomes <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> on the eyes after awhile." [...] Bain said the video [...] "is colorful, loud, vibrant, and a complete departure from the mostly depressing captivity scenarios and over-the-top war imagery of the previous videos from her Rated R singles." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly also commented on the vibrancy of the video and its resemblance to M.I.A.'s video, [...] "It's a wild explosion of clashing colors, bold block lettering, and shaky camerawork. As many observers instantly pointed out, it all owes more than a little to the aesthetic of M.I.A.which, if you ask me, is not a bad thing at all." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV commented on the change of visual direction in the video, calling it [...] "a colorful departure from the dark fare previously released from her Rated R album." [...] Vena also wrote about the stylization of the video's content with regard to Rihanna's heritage. She wrote that the video is infused with [...] "a kaleidoscope of prints and colors, embracing her roots in Caribbean dance-hall-inspired costumes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Proponents {{with the}} law have {{rejected}} such criticism, and argued that the law was reasonable, limited, and carefully crafted. [...] Stewart Baker, a former Homeland Security official in the George W. Bush administration, said, [...] "The coverage of this law and {{the text of the}} law are <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> to square. There's nothing in the law that requires cities to stop people without cause, or encourages racial or ethnic profiling by itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|An FBI {{recording}} of Black's hotel suite in April 1963 recorded him saying of Levinson to columnist Jack Anderson, [...] "Jack, some day when Eddie comes here for dinner or something, I {{want you to}} meet him. He's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> to describe. I know his whole background. He was probably the biggest bookmaker Detroit ever had. I know he was the biggest gambler Miami ever had. Then he went to Las Vegas. He came under the granddaddy law; it excused him for anything he ever did as long as he stayed working in Nevada. He told us all those things." ...|$|E
5000|$|After the judgment, Hinse used {{a copy of}} Edvard Munch's {{painting}} The Scream {{to illustrate}} his psychological condition in prison.

2500|$|Time {{reviewer}} Josh Tyrangiel praised guitarist Buck's [...] "resurgence" [...] and [...] "propulsive riffs," [...] {{but also}} wrote, [...] "R.E.M.'s 14th album never quite generates the moody atmospherics {{of their first}} 10; it's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> to lose yourself in something that doesn't pause long {{enough for you to}} get lost." [...] Uncut gave the album three out of five stars. Reviewer John Mulvey stated, [...] "Accelerate is a simple, pragmatic record built on an uncomfortable truth: sometimes, even the best bands have to retrace their steps, if only to remind themselves what they're really good at." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both Bajo and Hex from Good Game {{gave the}} game 10/10, the only such score they handed out in 2014. Both hosts praised the game's writing, voice acting, graphics, and gameplay, with Hex saying that [...] "the writing and voice acting is just excellent" [...] and that [...] "Those sword and board hits though Bajo! So rewarding! It's classic dungeon {{crawling}} combat isn't it?". Bajo praised the game's challenge, stating that [...] "where the combat truly shines is when you're in trouble" [...] {{as well as}} offering a minor criticism that [...] "The crafting system is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> to get your head around". They also awarded it [...] "Game of the Year" [...] in their annual Christmas special.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most popular}} {{structure}} {{at the site}} is the tzat tun tzat (sometimes written Satunsat, but most commonly called [...] "The Labyrinth"). [...] The Satunsat group is an outlier. It’s a single building, {{a sort of a}} maze or labyrinth, built to replicate a cave complex. There’s no real guess as to what it was built for, though there was a recent discovery that most the ventilation shafts line up with specific positions of the sun, so some think it was a maze used for initiation and practice of religion but there’s nothing conclusive. So it’s <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> to place Satunsat into any one phase, but sources continuously point to a probability that this structure was built in the early Oxkintok phase.|$|E

2500|$|That September, Gaye {{approached}} Gordy {{with the}} [...] "What's Going On" [...] song while in California where Gordy had relocated. Gordy took a profound dislike to the song, calling it [...] "the worst thing I ever heard in my life". Gaye, {{who had also}} begun recording some songs that would later be featured on his later album, Let's Get It On, responded by going on strike from recording anything else for the label unless Gordy relented. Motown executive Harry Balk later recalled that {{he had tried to}} get Gordy to release the song to which Gordy replied to Balk, [...] "that Dizzy Gillespie stuff in the middle, that scatting, it's old." [...] Most of Motown's Quality Control Department team also turned the song down, with Balk later stating that [...] "they were used to the 'baby baby' stuff, and this was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> for them to grasp." [...] Gordy also felt the song was too political to be a hit on radio and too unusual compared with what was considered a part of the popular music sound of that time to be commercially successful.|$|E
2500|$|The {{salmonella}} {{attack was}} noted {{as the first}} confirmed instance of chemical or biological terrorism to {{have occurred in the}} United States. Rajneesh stated that because he was in silence and isolation, meeting only with Sheela, he was unaware of the crimes committed by the Rajneeshpuram leadership until Sheela and her [...] "gang" [...] left and sannyasins came forward to inform him. A number of commentators have stated that they believe that Sheela was being used as a convenient scapegoat. Others have pointed to the fact that although Sheela had bugged Rajneesh's living quarters and made her tapes available to the US authorities as part of her own plea bargain, no evidence has ever come to light that Rajneesh had any part in her crimes. Nevertheless, Gordon (1987) reports that Charles Turner, David Frohnmayer and other law enforcement officials, who had surveyed affidavits never released publicly and who listened to hundreds of hours of tape recordings, insinuated to him that Rajneesh [...] as guilty of more crimes than those for which he was eventually prosecuted. Frohnmayer asserted that Rajneesh's philosophy was not [...] "disapproving of poisoning" [...] and that he felt he and Sheela had been [...] "genuinely evil". Nonetheless, US Attorney Turner and Attorney General Frohnmeyer acknowledged that [...] "they had little evidence of (Rajneesh) being involved in any of the criminal activities that unfolded at the ranch". According to court testimony by Ma Ava (Ava Avalos), a prominent disciple, Sheela played associates a tape recording of a meeting she had had with Rajneesh about the [...] "need to kill people" [...] in order to strengthen wavering sannyasins resolve in participating in her murderous plots: [...] "She came back to the meeting and [...] began to play the tape. It was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>hard</b> to hear what he was saying. [...] And the gist of Bhagwan's response, yes, {{it was going to be}} necessary to kill people to stay in Oregon. And that actually killing people wasn't such a bad thing. And actually Hitler was a great man, although he could not say that publicly because nobody would understand that. Hitler had great vision." [...] Sheela initiated attempts to murder Rajneesh's caretaker and girlfriend, Ma Yoga Vivek, and his personal physician, Swami Devaraj (Dr. George Meredith), because she thought that they were a threat to Rajneesh. She had secretly recorded a conversation between Devaraj and Rajneesh [...] "in which the doctor agreed to obtain drugs the guru wanted to ensure a peaceful death if he decided to take his own life".|$|E
