40|$|Since Saarni (1979) {{began to}} {{research}} on children's understanding of social display rules, some developmental research on regulation of emotional expression was reported. This paper reviewed these studies from <b>a</b> social <b>developmental</b> {{point of view}} and <b>a</b> cognitive <b>developmental</b> point of view. First, from <b>a</b> social <b>developmental</b> point of view, children's acquisition of social display rules by socialization or social learning was suggested. Second, from <b>a</b> cognitive <b>developmental</b> point of view, the development of knowledge about strategy of emotion regulation, distinction between real and apparent emotion, and cognitive abilities was demonstrated. Finally, directions for continued research were shown. Especially the importance of consideration of social context and the influence of emotion regulation on interpersonal relationship were pointed out...|$|R
