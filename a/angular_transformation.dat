While commonly used for statistical analysis of proportional data, the arcsine square root transformation is not recommended because logistic regression or a logit transformation are more appropriate for binomial or non-binomial proportions, respectively, especially due to decreased type-II error.|$|E

This transformation {{has to be taken}} into account, when planning and executing movement and its existence may affect performance. In the present study we investigated how <b>angular</b> gain <b>transformations</b> between movement and visual feedback during circling movements affect coordination performance. Participants coordinated the visual feedback (feedback dot) with a continuously circling stimulus (stimulus dot) on a computer screen in order to produce mirror symmetric trajectories of them. The movement angle was multiplied by a gain factor (0. 5 to 2; 9 levels) before it was presented on the screen. Thus, the <b>angular</b> gain <b>transformations</b> changed the spatio-temporal relationship between the movement and its feedback in visual space, and resulted in a non-constant mapping of movement to feedback positions. Coordination performance was best with gain = 1. With high gains the feedback dot was in lead of the stimulus dot, with small gains it lagged behind. Anchoring (reduced movement variability) occurred when the two trajectories were close to each other. Awareness of the transformation depended on the deviation of the gain from 1. In conclusion, the size of an <b>angular</b> gain <b>transformation</b> as well as its mere presence influence performance in {{a situation in which the}} mapping of movement positions to visual feedback positions is not constant.

We investigated how <b>angular</b> shift <b>transformations</b> between circling movements and their visual feedback affect the coordination of this feedback with visual events in the environment. We used a task that required participants to coordinate the visual feedback of a circular hand movement (presented on the right side of a screen) with a circling stimulus (presented on the left side of a screen). Four stimulus-visual feedback relations were instructed: same or different rotations of stimulus and visual feedback, either in same or different y-directions. Visual speed was varied in 3 levels (0. 8 Hz, 1 Hz, and 1. 2 Hz). The movement-visual feedback relation was manipulated using 8 angular shifts: (- 180 °, - 135 °, - 90 °, - 45 °, 0 °, 45 °, 90 °, and 135 °). Participants were not able to perform the different rotation/different y-direction pattern, but instead fell into the different rotation/same y-direction pattern. The different rotation/same y-direction pattern and the same rotation/same y-direction pattern were performed equally well, performance was worse in the same rotation/different y-direction pattern. Best performance was observed with angular shifts 0 ° and - 45 ° and performance declined with larger angular shifts. Further, performance was better with negative angular shifts than with positive angular shifts. Participants did not fully take the <b>angular</b> shift <b>transformation</b> into account: when the angular shifts were negative the visual feedback was more in advance, and when angular shifts were positive the visual feedback was less in advance of the stimulus than in 0 ° angular shift.

40|$|Abstract—The {{rapid growth}} of e-Commerce {{services}} is significantly observed in the past decade. However, the method to verify the authenticated users still widely depends on numeric approaches. A new search on other verification methods suitable for online e-Commerce is an interesting issue. In this paper, a new online signature-verification method using <b>angular</b> <b>transformation</b> is presented. Delay shifts existing in online signatures are estimated by the estimation method relying on angle representation. In the proposed signature-verification algorithm, all components of input signature are extracted by considering the discontinuous break points on the stream of angular values. Then the estimated delay shift is captured by comparing with the selected reference signature and the error matching can be computed as a main feature used for verifying process. The threshold offsets are calculated by two types of error characteristics of the signature verification problem, False Rejection Rate (FRR) and False Acceptance Rate (FAR). The level of these two error rates depends on the decision threshold chosen whose value is such as to realize the Equal Error Rate (EER; FAR = FRR). The experimental results show that through the simple programming, employed on Internet for demonstrating e-Commerce services, the proposed method can provide 95. 39 % correct verifications and 7 % better than DP matching based signature-verification method. In addition, the signature verification with extracting components provides more reliable results than using a whole decision making.

40|$|Clustering {{techniques}} {{have been widely}} used in the analysis of microarray data to group genes with similar expression profiles. The similarity of expression profiles and hence the results of clustering greatly depend on how the data has been transformed. We present a method that uses the relative expression changes between pairs of conditions and an <b>angular</b> <b>transformation</b> to define the similarity of gene expresion patterns. The pairwise comparisons of experimental conditions can be chosen to reflect the purpose of clustering allowing control the definition of similarity between genes. A variational Bayes mixture modeling approach is then used to find clusters within the transformed data. The purpose of microarray data analysis is often to locate groups genes showing particular patterns of expression change and within these groups to locate specific target genes that may warrant further experimental investigation. We show that the <b>angular</b> <b>transformation</b> maps data to a representation from which information, in terms of relative regulation changes, can be automatically mined. This information can then be used to understand the "features" of expression change important to different clusters allowing potentially interesting clusters to be easily located.

This enables to obtain the spin and orbital angular momentum representations which are valid everywhere in the transformed beam space. Simple analytical results are available for the transversely homogeneous circularly polarized incident beam limited only by the circular aperture. Behavior of the spin and orbital angular momenta of the output beam and their dependences on the focusing strength (aperture angle) are analyzed.
