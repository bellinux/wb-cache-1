5|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> is a {{national}} symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru and {{plays an important role}} in the folklore and mythology of the Andean regions. The <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> is considered near threatened by the IUCN. It is threatened by habitat loss and by secondary poisoning from carcasses killed by hunters. Captive breeding programs have been instituted in several countries.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> is a {{national}} symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuelan Andes states. It is the national bird of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador. It {{plays an important role}} in the folklore and mythology of the South American Andean regions, and has been represented in Andean art from c. 2500 BCE onward, and they are a part of indigenous Andean religions. In Andean mythology, the <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> was associated with the sun deity, and was believed to be the ruler of the upper world. The <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> is considered a symbol of power and health by many Andean cultures, and it was believed that the bones and organs of the <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> possessed medicinal powers, sometimes leading to the hunting and killing of condors to obtain its bones and organs. In some versions of Peruvian bullfighting, a condor is tied to the back of a bull, where it pecks at the animal as bullfighters fight it. The condor generally survives and is set free.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> is {{the only}} {{accepted}} living species of its genus, Vultur. Unlike the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), which is known from extensive fossil remains and some additional ones of , the fossil record of the <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> recovered to date is scant. Presumed Plio-Pleistocene species of South American condors were later recognized to be not different from the present species, although one known only from a few rather small bones found in a Pliocene deposit of Tarija Department, Bolivia, {{may have been a}} smaller palaeosubspecies, V. gryphus patruus.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the animals}} living here are guanacos, vicunas, foxes, mice, <b>Andean</b> <b>condors,</b> lechuzos, chimangos, partridges, martinetas, hares and wild rabbits.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to the capture of all the wild individuals of the California condor, in 1988 the US Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive <b>Andean</b> <b>condors</b> into the wild in California. Only females were released to prevent it becoming an invasive species. The experiment was a success, and all the <b>Andean</b> <b>condors</b> were recaptured and re-released in South America before the reintroduction of the California condors took place.|$|R

5|$|In Peru, {{they are}} {{occasionally}} shot, {{but more often}} revered and used for ceremonial purposes. The Yawar Fiesta is a celebration, the pinnacle {{of which is the}} tying of an <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> to the back of a bull, allowing the condor to kill the bull with its talons before being released. This ceremony is a symbolic representation {{of the power of the}} Andean peoples (the condor) over the Spanish (the bull). There is also a ceremony known as the arranque del condor in which a live <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> is suspended from a frame and is punched to death by horsemen as they ride by.|$|E
5|$|More than 120 {{bird species}} have been {{reported}} in this area including the <b>Andean</b> <b>condor,</b> the torrent duck, the puna tinamou, the brown pintail, the Andean crested duck, the giant hummingbird, the yanavico, the white-tufted grebe, the giant coot, the chiguanco thrush and the Andean gull.|$|E
5|$|Like other New World vultures, the <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through {{evaporation}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a reason for}} this behavior, but it does not make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, local {{authorities}} of the Ancasmarca region rescued two <b>Andean</b> <b>condors</b> that were caged and {{displayed in a}} local market as an attraction for tourists.|$|R

5000|$|The organisms living in/around {{the lake}} are river otters , deer , foxes , cougars , and guanacos {{and the birds}} that fly around there are ducks , geese , swans , Austral parakeets , cormants and <b>Andean</b> <b>condors.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> is {{a popular}} figure on stamps in many countries, {{appearing}} on one for Ecuador in 1958, Argentina in 1960, Peru in 1973, Bolivia in 1985, Colombia in 1992, Chile in 2001, and Venezuela in 2004. It has also appeared on the coins and banknotes of Colombia and Chile. The condor is featured in several coats of arms of Andean countries {{as a symbol of}} Andes mountains.|$|E
5|$|Fauna is {{similarly}} distributed, with distinct altitudinal zonation present. The highest altitudes support the endangered mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), cougar (Puma concolor), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), and Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus). Lower down, the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), brocket deers (Mazama sp.), vulnerable northern pudú (Pudu mephistophiles), and endangered giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) {{can all be}} found. Bird species common in the area include the <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> (Vultur gryphus), Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas), torrent duck (Merganetta armata), king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), and swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus).|$|E
5|$|Today's California condor is {{the sole}} {{surviving}} member of Gymnogyps and has no accepted subspecies. However, there is a Late Pleistocene form that is sometimes regarded as a palaeosubspecies, Gymnogyps californianus amplus. Current opinions are mixed regarding the classification of the form as a chronospecies or a separate species Gymnogyps amplus. Gymnogyps amplus occurred {{over much of the}} bird's historical range – even extending into Florida – but was larger, having about the same weight as the <b>Andean</b> <b>condor.</b> This bird also had a wider bill. As the climate changed during the last ice age, the entire population became smaller until it had evolved into the Gymnogyps californianus of today, although more recent studies by Syverson query that theory.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to these exhibit, the zoo {{is also home to}} a pair of <b>Andean</b> <b>condors</b> which can be found by the entrance of the zoo, as well as free-roaming Indian peafowl, West African helmeted guineafowl, and ocellated turkeys.|$|R
5|$|As {{the number}} of condors grew, {{attention}} {{began to focus on}} releasing some back into the wild. In 1988, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive <b>Andean</b> <b>condors</b> into the wild in California. Only females were released, to eliminate the possibility of accidentally introducing a South American species into the United States. The experiment was a success, and all the <b>Andean</b> <b>condors</b> were recaptured and re-released in South America. California condors were released in 1991 and 1992 in California, and again in 1996 in Arizona near the Grand Canyon. Though the birth rate remains low in the wild, their numbers are increasing steadily through regular releases of captive-reared adolescents.|$|R
5|$|The exact taxonomic {{placement}} of the <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors {{in different parts of}} the world and are not closely related. Just how different the two families are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead described them as incertae sedis, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible.|$|E
5|$|Other hunting traditions then follow, again {{rooted in}} religion. The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act {{in which they}} copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt, and a stag hunt in France, rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the Gauls, is blessed by a mass before the hunt takes place, during which the hunters and dogs chase and {{ultimately}} kill a fleeing stag. In a fox hunt, the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with a laxative to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an Afghan bitch in heat. Their efforts are then connected to species conservation, and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation, Argentine hunters capture an <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> to sell to a zoo. A collage of other conservation efforts is shown, including the tagging of white rhinoceroses, grizzly bears and elephants, which are shot with morphine darts. Argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked. Tourists on Africans safaris then come to view the conservation efforts, which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals' violent instincts. This deception is demonstrated with the mauling of a tourist named Pit Dernitz by lions.|$|E
5|$|Although it locates food by vision, {{the role}} smell has {{in how it}} {{specifically}} finds carrion has been debated. Consensus has been {{that it does not}} detect odours, and instead follows the smaller turkey and greater yellow-headed vultures, which do have a sense of smell, to a carcass, but a 1991 study demonstrated that the king vulture could find carrion in the forest without the aid of other vultures, suggesting that it locates food using an olfactory sense. The king vulture primarily eats carrion found in the forest, though it is known to venture onto nearby savannas in search of food. Once it has found a carcass, the king vulture displaces the other vultures because of its large size and strong bill. However, when it is at the same kill as the larger <b>Andean</b> <b>condor,</b> the king vulture always defers to it. Using its bill to tear, it makes the initial cut in a fresh carcass. This allows the smaller, weaker-beaked vultures, which can not open the hide of a carcass, access to the carcass after the king vulture has fed. The vulture’s tongue is rasp-like, which allows it to pull flesh off of the carcass’s bones. Generally, it only eats the skin and harder parts of the tissue of its meal. The king vulture has also been recorded eating fallen fruit of the moriche palm when carrion is scarce in Bolívar state, Venezuela.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 Leden's {{autobiography}} Flying with Condors was published. This {{title was}} also used for a BBC 1 Natural World documentary in which Leden and her husband Chris Dawes travelled to Patagonia to fly with <b>Andean</b> <b>condors</b> using hang gliders, paragliders and paramotors.|$|R
50|$|Legends of the Wild is the Akron Zoo's largest exhibit. It {{includes}} a 25-foot waterfall and over 15 animal exhibits. The displays in Legends of the Wild’s exhibit include Humboldt penguins, lemurs, snakes, llamas, <b>Andean</b> <b>condors,</b> jaguars, capybara, snow leopards, and flamingos.|$|R
50|$|The zoo has <b>Andean</b> <b>condors,</b> {{a variety}} of felines such as bobcat and serval It {{features}} numerous animals from Central and South America, such as llamas, capybara, toucans, a two-toed sloth, parrots, and more. Some animals are not on exhibit in the winter.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> is {{considered}} near {{threatened by the}} IUCN. It was first placed on the United States Endangered Species list in 1970, a status which is assigned to an animal that {{is in danger of}} extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Threats to its population include loss of habitat needed for foraging, secondary poisoning from animals killed by hunters and persecution. It is threatened mainly in the northern area of its range, and is extremely rare in Venezuela and Colombia, where it has undergone considerable declines in recent years. Because it is adapted to very low mortality and has correspondingly low reproductive rates, it is extremely vulnerable to human persecution, most of which {{stems from the fact that}} it is perceived as a threat by farmers due to alleged attacks on livestock. Education programs have been implemented by conservationists to dispel this misconception. Reintroduction programs using captive-bred Andean condors, which release birds hatched in North American zoos into the wild to bolster populations, have been introduced in Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. The first captive-bred Andean condors were released into the wild in 1989. When raising condors, human contact is minimal; chicks are fed with glove puppets which resemble adult Andean condors in order to prevent the chicks from imprinting on humans, which would endanger them upon release as they would not be wary of humans. The condors are kept in aviaries for three months prior to release, where they acclimatize to an environment similar to that which they will be released in. Released condors are tracked by satellite in order to observe their movements and to monitor whether they are still alive.|$|E

50|$|Wildlife Trails is a 0.5 mi {{trail that}} takes {{visitors}} past {{animals such as}} caribou, blue cranes, markhor goats, Amur tigers, owls, bald eagles, red wolf, Thorold's deer, elephants, red pandas, Humboldt penguins, spectacled bears, <b>Andean</b> <b>condors,</b> Reeve's muntjacs, Asian elephants, Siberian lynx, fishers, grey wolves, and snow leopards.|$|R
50|$|The zoo {{has also}} sent animals in their {{collection}} to be reintroduced {{into the wild}} to help boost wild populations. Species the zoo {{has contributed to the}} reintroduction of include red wolves, golden lion tamarins, <b>Andean</b> <b>condors,</b> and brook trout. The zoo hopes to soon breed and reintroduce Mexican wolves as well.|$|R
25|$|Among the fauna {{that can}} be {{observed}} on the páramo are <b>Andean</b> <b>condor,</b> black agouti, eastern cottontail, frogs, mountain paca, spectacled bear, white-tailed deer. The spectacled bear is very rare and possibly extinct. The white tailed deer, the main ingredient of the diet of the Muisca and pre-Muisca, has been extensively hunted and captured over time.|$|E
25|$|Birds of Prey is {{a row of}} cages for {{multiple}} raptor species. The exhibit is home to bald eagles, snowy owls, European eagle-owls, a barred owl, an <b>Andean</b> <b>condor,</b> cinereous vultures, and king vultures. In February 2011, the zoo received two bald eagles rescued in Wyoming. Nearby is a small pond for black-necked swans, American white pelicans, and brown pelicans.|$|E
25|$|The Legend of the Condor Heroes is a wuxia {{novel by}} Jin Yong (Louis Cha). It {{is the first}} part of the Condor Trilogy and is {{followed}} by The Return of the Condor Heroes and The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber. It was first serialised between 1 January 1957 and 19 May 1959 in Hong Kong Commercial Daily. Jin Yong revised the novel twice, first in the 1970s and later in the 2000s. The English title is a mistranslation since both species of the condor, the <b>Andean</b> <b>condor</b> and Californian condor, are not native to China. A more accurate translation is Story of the Eagle Shooting Hero.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} how <b>Andean</b> <b>Condors</b> (Vultur gryphus) segregate by sex and age {{in summer and}} autumn at a communal roost in the Patagonian Andes. Preferred roosting places received earlier sun at sunrise (summer) and later sun at sunset (autumn); sheltered crevices were also selected. Individuals strongly competed for preferred places: adults dominated juveniles and within each age class males dominated females. Although individuals preferred roosting places independent of their dominance status, fighting and subsequent relocating led to a defined social structure at the roost. Sunny exposures may allow occupants to maximize time available for foraging, plumage care, and maintenance, and to avoid cold stress. Irregularity in the spatial distribution and aggregation patterns of <b>Andean</b> <b>Condors</b> {{may be the result}} of requirements for roosting. Availability of adequate roost places should be considered in conservation programs. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2002. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
