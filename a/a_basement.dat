5|$|An old {{belief is}} that the {{southwest}} corner of <b>a</b> <b>basement</b> provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in <b>a</b> <b>basement,</b> under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|East of {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} was a two-storey building with <b>a</b> <b>basement.</b> The basement was probably used for storage while the above two floors provided accommodation. The purpose of the buildings along {{the west end of}} the north range is uncertain. The sparse arrangement, with little provision for lighting, has led to suggestions that it was used as stables, however there are no drains which are usually associated with stables. The tower in the northwest corner of the castle had a garderobe and fireplace on each of the three above-ground floors, and there was <b>a</b> <b>basement</b> underneath.|$|E
5|$|In September 1992 {{the museum}} {{was the target of}} a Provisional Irish Republican Army attack against London tourist attractions. Two {{incendiary}} devices were found in <b>a</b> <b>basement</b> gallery, but were extinguished by staff before the arrival of the fire brigade, and caused only minor damage.|$|E

50|$|Inside {{the house}} is <b>a</b> barrel-vault <b>basement,</b> <b>a</b> tower room with star vault, and a {{fireplace}} from the renaissance. By 1800, the basic structure had been significantly reduced, and the fortification, except for the main wing, was dismantled.|$|R
5000|$|In a [...] "look-out" [...] {{basement}}, {{the basement}} walls extend sufficiently {{above ground level}} {{that some of the}} basement windows are above ground level. Where the site slopes gently and is insufficient for <b>a</b> walk-out <b>basement,</b> <b>a</b> look-out <b>basement</b> tends to result. Sometimes, <b>a</b> look-out <b>basement</b> is deliberately constructed even on a flat site. The advantage is that the basement windows are all above grade. The disadvantage is that the main floor entry is above grade as well, utilizing stairs to access the main floor. The raised Bungalow design (known as a split-entry home in much of the US) solves this by lowering the entry halfway between the main floor and <b>basement</b> to make <b>a</b> dramatic, high-ceiling foyer. It is a very economical design because the basement is shallower, and excavation costs are reduced.|$|R

5|$|Most of the {{northern}} towers stand had four-storeys including a basements. The Eagle Tower at the western corner of the castle was the grandest.

5|$|The {{refinery}} {{was large}} and old, featuring outdated construction methods, and these factors {{are believed to have}} contributed to the fire's severity.

Investigations conducted by the Department of Justice ruled out deliberate criminal activity in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Though tornadoes {{can strike}} in an instant, there are {{precautions}} and preventative measures {{that people can}} take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to <b>a</b> <b>basement</b> or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.|$|E
5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) hesitates {{to take a}} new {{murder case}} because he fears it will be too {{difficult}} to solve, so it is taken on by his partner Howard (Melissa Leo), who has recently experienced a perfect streak of solving 11 consecutive cases. They investigate the body of a man dead in <b>a</b> <b>basement,</b> and much to Felton's bewilderment, Howard solves the case easily. The owner of the house, Jerry Jempson (Jim Grollman), literally calls her at the house while she is investigating and agrees to a police interview, during which he acts extremely nervous and is eventually charged with the murder.|$|E

Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the man has the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry that was right under the access hatch.|$|E
