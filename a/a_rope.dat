5|$|A {{downline}} is <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> {{leading from}} the surface down to the underwater workplace.

5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} and risk of meeting the Huaorani on the ground, the missionaries chose to drop gifts to the Huaorani by fixed-wing aircraft. Their drop technique, developed by Nate Saint, involved flying around the drop location in tight circles while lowering the gift from the plane on <b>a</b> <b>rope.</b> This kept the bundle in roughly {{the same position as}} it approached the ground. On October 6, 1955, Saint made the first drop, releasing a small kettle containing buttons and rock salt. The gift-giving continued during the following weeks, with the missionaries dropping machetes, ribbons, clothing, pots, and various trinkets.|$|E
50|$|Static ropes {{have some}} {{applications}} in climbing, though lead climbing, for instance, is always done with <b>a</b> dynamic <b>rope,</b> since <b>a</b> fall on <b>a</b> static <b>rope</b> is stopped too quickly and {{may lead to}} serious injury. Abseiling, however, is best done with <b>a</b> static <b>rope</b> or, alternately, with <b>a</b> dynamic <b>rope</b> with low elasticity.|$|R

5|$|California {{sea lions}} {{are used in}} {{military}} applications by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, including detecting naval mines and enemy divers. In the Persian Gulf, the animals {{have been trained to}} swim behind divers approaching a U.S. naval ship and attach a clamp with <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> to the diver's leg. Navy officials say that the sea lions can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like PETA believe that such operations put the animals in danger. The Navy insists that the sea lions are removed once their mission is complete.|$|E
5|$|During a LARP, player {{actions in}} the real world {{represent}} character actions in an imaginary setting. Game rules, physical symbols and theatrical improvisation are used to bridge differences between the real world and the setting. For example, <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> could signify an imaginary wall. Realistic-looking weapon props and risky physical activity are sometimes discouraged or forbidden for safety reasons. While the fictional timeline in a tabletop RPG often progresses in game-time, which may be much faster or slower than the time passing for players, LARPs are different in that they usually run in real-time, with game-time only being used in special circumstances.|$|E

While there, he became part owner of <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> and bagging factory with Benjamin H. Buckner.|$|E

5|$|Roope, who drowned when {{he could}} no longer hang on to <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> whilst being pulled {{up the side of the}} cruiser, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, thus {{becoming}} the first VC recipient of the Second World War. The award was justified, in part, by the recommendation of Heye, who wrote to the British authorities via the Red Cross, giving a statement of the valiant courage Roope had shown when engaging a much superior ship in close battle. Ramsay was also awarded the DSO. Both awards were made after the end of the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{first case}} against Acton, before Mr. Baron Carter, {{was for the}} murder in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a {{carpenter}} and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left with so little to eat that {{he had tried to}} escape by throwing <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, stamped on his stomach, placed him in the hole (a damp space under the stairs), then in the strong room.|$|E

The gallows operated via <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> tied around a beam, over a trap door, on the upper level. Opening the trap door would cause the condemned prisoner fall, and thus be hanged.|$|E

While the Coast Guard went to recover the second body, a call came in about a third, which was seen floating 200 yards to the east. All three female {{bodies were found}} face down, bound with <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> around the neck, and naked below the waist.|$|E
5|$|A {{shot line}} is <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant {{to support the}} weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the line is all taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E

A Jonline may be used to fasten a diver to a shotline during a decompression stop.|$|E
