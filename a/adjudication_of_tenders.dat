40|$|Magister Legum - LLMBlack Economic Empowerment (BEE) {{has been}} a topic of {{discussion}} {{since the dawn of}} democracy in April 1994. Due to the entrenched inequalities of the past, economic empowerment is very important for the economic growth of the majority of South Africa’s citizens. However, significant economic enrichment of black people has not been made, despite, economic success, legislation, state policies and programme interventions. This economic growth is to be realised through the use of preferential procurement as a policy tool for BEE. Whilst sufficient legislation has been enacted to regulate preferential procurement, to favour black people, much still seems to be lacking in the enforcement of the laws in public procurement. Central to the challenges of preferential procurement is the disharmony between the Framework legislation governing preferential procurement and BEE. This discord has seen two visions being followed for preferential procurement; the Procurement Act refers to the beneficiaries of BEE as historically disadvantaged individuals (HDI; s) and the goals for BEE are measured through specific goals which promotes narrow empowerment; the BBBEE Act on the other hand defines black people as the recipients of BEE and through the BEE Codes broad-based empowerment is promoted through seven core elements. This congruency has not served the promotion of preferential procurement, it has created a hindrance that frustrates economic growth for those it is intended. The other quandary that undermines the success of preferential procurement is willful practices engaged by both tenderers and public officials; skills deficiency in the <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenders</b> and self-interest. The success of BEE through preferential procurement is dependent on a coherently legislated procurement environment fortified by perceptive public officials. The objective of this thesis is to analyse the impact of these challenges on the success of preferential procurement. The study will highlight the main practices that defeat the use of preferential procurement. This will include an analysis of the various legislation and the amendments thereto. In addition the enquiry will examine the proficiency of public officials in the adjudication of public tendering. Recommendations for a successful preferential public procurement environment will be made. The proposed thesis will utilise, inter alia, relevant legislation, case law, theses, journals, books and policy documents. South Afric...|$|E
40|$|Thirteen {{years in}} the new {{democratic}} South Africa, South Africa is still faced with socio-economic problems such as high rates of unemployment, shortage of housing, crime and HIV/Aids. Buffalo city falls within the Amathole District Municipality (ADM). ADM population is estimated at + 1, 67 million, being predominantly rural and living in low socio-economic conditions. The demographic trends of ADM population depict high poverty, illiteracy and unemployment rates, rendering them prone to high morbidity and mortality (www. amathole. gov. za, 2007). The aim {{of this research was}} to assess the role of the SMMEs in the socio-economic development of Buffalo City. This study is based on exploratory quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. Using a convenience sampling technique structured questionnaires were used to collect data amongst 28 SMMEs in Buffalo City. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} SMMEs play a vital role in the socio-economic development of Buffalo City. The SMMEs create employment and incomes; provide human capital investment in form of training programs and HIV/Aids programs; make donations to community structures; give sponsors to various sports clubs and food to the homeless. Finally SMMEs contribute towards tax revenues that in turn help reduce poverty and redistribute wealth. However, SMMEs in Buffalo City face a number of constraints, namely, lack of access to funding, lack of operating space, and high cost of property to lease and difficulty in finding trained competent staff. Further, the perceptions of the SMMEs about the <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenders</b> was some biasness in the adjudication of tender in favour of those who were close to the public officials. There was no accountability and professionalism amongst the adjudicating officials. Finally the government was not doing enough to encourage SMME development in Buffalo City. In view of the socio-economic benefits of the SMMEs in Buffalo city, it is recommended that support programmes to the SMMEs should be enhanced. On the basis of the findings in this study, it is suggested that assistance to the SMMEs should go beyond institutional support such as Ntsika, Khula, DTI and/or SEDA but should be targeted to funding opportunities for the SMMEs. Commercial banks should be involved in ensuring that SMMEs obtain access to funding. Infrastructural facilities such as affordable business premises should be provided for the SMMEs. Affordable premises will reduce the overhead costs of the SMMEs and in turn increase the profits of these SMMEs. Increase the profits of the SMMEs will ensure the survival of the SMMEs and will in turn contribute towards the upliftment of the socio-economic status of the people who would have otherwise been unemployed, destitute and poo...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} the goods or {{services}} that government procures is obviously a very important consideration in deciding which supplier should be awarded a particular public tender. It follows that in the regulation of public procurement, particular attention {{should be given to}} the role of quality (also called functionality) in the <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> public <b>tenders</b> and the final award decision. In South African public procurement law, the role of functionality in public tender adjudication has been a fairly controversial issue that has resulted in a continuing interaction between courts and law-makers on how and when quality should be assessed and should impact on the final award decision within the framework for public procurement found in section 217 of the Constitution. This contribution tracks the development of the role of functionality in public tender adjudication as prescribed by public procurement regulation since the enactment of the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act 5 of 2000, which spearheaded the development of contemporary public procurement regulation in South Africa. The analysis shows how the role of functionality has constantly changed since the enactment of the PPPFA and remains uncertain. This uncertainty relates to different interpretations of the constitutional requirements for public procurement primarily contained in section 217 (1) of the Constitution. Whether functionality is used as a qualification criterion, an award criterion or both holds particular practical implications for both suppliers and contracting authorities. It is accordingly important to have certainty on this question. However, it cannot be said that the Constitution and section 217 in particular dictates one approach rather than another. The issue should thus be resolved with reference to the statutory scheme adopted under the PPPFA...|$|R

40|$|Conditions for <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> {{bankruptcy}} The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyse conditions for <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> bankruptcy. My thesis {{is composed of}} nine chapters, each of them dealing with {{different aspects of the}} conditions for adjudication bankruptcy. Chapter One is an introduction and defines my motivation for writing about conditions for <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> bankruptcy. I have chosen this topic because I'm interested in the issue of insolvency law. In my opinion, this is really an up to date topic, as there are recently more and more people and companies which are in financial trouble. Chapter Two is subdivided into two subchapters. Subchapter One defines the term of bankruptcy and the development of its meaning over the years. Subchapter Two describes the systematic of the Insolvency Act (Act No. 182 / 2006 Coll. On Insolvency and its Settlement Methods) and explains the classification of bankruptcy within the Act. Chapter Three covers the historical development of the conditions, starting in 1781 with Josephine Bankruptcy Act. It provides a short illustration of the transformation in the conditions for <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> bankruptcy over the past years. Chapter Four characterises the conditions for <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> bankruptcy and enumerates them. This chapter generally divides the conditions to the substantive [...] ...|$|R
