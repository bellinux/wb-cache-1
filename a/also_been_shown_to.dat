5|$|A {{specific}} {{example of}} an RNA thermometer motif is the FourU thermometer found in Salmonella enterica. When exposed to temperatures above 45°C, the stem-loop that base-pairs opposite the Shine-Dalgarno sequence becomes unpaired and allows the mRNA to enter the ribosome for translation to occur. Mg2+ ion concentration has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> affect the stability of FourU. The most well-studied RNA thermometer {{is found in the}} rpoH gene in Escherichia coli. This thermosensor upregulates heat shock proteins under high temperatures through σ32, a specialised heat-shock sigma factor.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus stercoreus {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for its ability to}} break down lignin and cellulose in agricultural byproducts, like wheat straw or grasses. It selectively breaks down lignin, leaving much of the cellulose intact, which increases the amount of digestible carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its biodegradability. The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have industrial applications for lignin degradation and removal in the pulp and paper industry. Liquid cultures of C.stercoreus have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> biodegrade the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).|$|E

5|$|It may be {{possible}} to exploit RNA interference in therapy. Although it is difficult to introduce long dsRNA strands into mammalian cells due to the interferon response, the use of short interfering RNA has been more successful.

5|$|Several {{measures}} {{can be taken}} to control infection in aquaculture once an S.iniae outbreak has been confirmed. Decreasing the quantity of feed given to fish has been shown to reduce mortality rates, as the uptake of bacteria in water is expedited by feeding. Decreasing the density of the fish stock increases survival by reducing injury to fish and lowering the general stress level in the population. Lowering the water temperature and keeping optimal oxygen levels has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> reduce stress to fish and inhibit bacterial growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} {{produces}} {{a variety of}} vocalizations, {{the most common of}} which are the tremolo, the yodel, the wail, and the hoot. Each of these calls communicates a distinct message. The frequency at which it vocalizes has been shown to vary based on time of day, weather, and season. It is most vocally active between mid-May and mid-June. The wail, yodel, and tremolo calls are sounded more frequently at night than during the day; calls have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> occur more frequently in cold temperatures and when there is little to no rain.|$|E

5|$|Trillium grandiflorum {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} by ecologists due {{to a number of}} unique features it possesses. It is a representative example of a plant whose seeds are spread through myrmecochory, or ant-mediated dispersal, which is effective in increasing the plant's ability to outcross, but ineffective in bringing the plant very far. This has led ecologists to question how it and similar plants were able to survive glaciation events during the ice ages. The height of the species has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be an effective index of how intense foraging by deer is in a particular area.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> reduce the risk of death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E
5|$|Suillus sibiricus {{has been}} {{recorded}} in parts of Europe, North America and Siberia. The fungus forms strict ectomycorrhizal associations with pines of the subgenus Strobus. These include Swiss pine (Pinus cembra) in the Alps and Tatras of central Europe, Macedonian pine (P.peuce) in the Balkans, western white pine (P.monticola) and limber pine (P.flexilis) in the Pacific Northwest of North America, P.banksiana in Quebec, Canada, and Siberian pine (P.sibirica) and Siberian dwarf pine (P.pumila) in Siberia and the Russian Far East. The range of the fungus is hence limited by {{the distribution of the}} host tree. S.sibiricus has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be able to form ectomycorrhizae with the Himalayan species P.wallichiana in pure culture conditions in the laboratory.|$|E

5|$|Ailanthus {{produces}} an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits {{the growth of}} other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings {{with the exception of}} velvetleaf, which showed some resistance. Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Mups {{are members}} of a large family of low-molecular weight (~19kDa) {{proteins}} known as lipocalins. They have a characteristic structure of eight beta sheets arranged in an anti-parallel beta barrel open on one face, with alpha helices at both ends. Consequently, they form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a cup-like pocket that binds small organic chemicals with high affinity. A number of these ligands bind to mouse Mups, including 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (abbreviated as SBT or DHT), 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone (HMH) and 2,3 dihydro-exo-brevicomin (DHB). These are all urine-specific chemicals that have been shown to act as pheromones—molecular signals excreted by one individual that trigger an innate behavioural response in another member of the same species. Mouse Mups have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> function as pheromone stabilizers, providing a slow release mechanism that extends the potency of volatile pheromones in male urine scent marks. Given the diversity of Mups in rodents, it was originally thought that different Mups may have differently shaped binding pockets and therefore bind different pheromones. However, detailed studies found that most variable sites are located {{on the surface of the}} proteins, and appear to have little effect on ligand binding.|$|E
5|$|Suillus collinitus is {{the most}} {{frequent}} fungus associating with Aleppo pine – a hardy tree utilised for reforestation schemes and soil conservation against erosion in the Mediterranean region. A study performed {{in the south of}} France discovered that S.collinitus and S.mediterraneensis are multi-stage ectomycorrhizal fungi, associating with both young and mature stands of Aleppo pine. These two species may {{play a key role in}} the survival and adaptation of this species of pine on disturbed calcareous sites. Roots mycorrhizal with S.collinitus were found capable of surviving successive disturbances by fire or ploughing. Moreover, the fungus retained its viability to propagate via its mycelial network which helped the recolonisation effort of newly introduced trees. The fungus has <b>also</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> improve the growth of Mediterranean pines grown in greenhouses and nurseries. Unlike other Suillus species that grow in wet climates, such as S.grevillei and S.spraguei, S.collinitus does not typically produce fruit bodies in young plantations. This fruiting behaviour may be attributed to the typically nutrient-poor xeric Mediterranean environment in combination with a lack of tree canopy. The absence of above-ground indicators of fungal presence makes analysis of underground populations difficult; molecular markers have been developed to assist in monitoring fungal growth and ectomycorrhizal formation and persistence in young plantations.|$|E
