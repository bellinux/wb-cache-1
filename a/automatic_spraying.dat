50|$|Three main {{techniques}} are employed over a 3- to 5-year period: pheromone traps for detection, cultural practices {{to reduce the}} weevil’s food supply, and malathion treatments. During the first year, applications of malathion are made every five to seven days starting in late summer. The frequency is reduced to every 10 days during the later part of the growing season until the first frost. The cotton stalks are shredded and plowed into the ground to eliminate their use as a winter shelter. During years 2 through 5, the <b>automatic</b> <b>spraying</b> is supplemented by an intensive trapping program (one trap per 1-2 acres), and malathion applications are made only in those fields where weevils are detected. This phase begins in late spring and continues until the first killing frost. The final phase of the program involves monitoring and trapping at a density of one trap per 10 acre, with spot spraying as required. The program has become more high-tech in recent years, employing GPS mapping technology and bar code readers that transmit trap data electronically.|$|E
40|$|Single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWNTs) {{have been}} introduced as compliant electrodes for dielectric elastomers (DEs) due to fault tolerance. To acquire a better electrostrictive strain and longer lifetime, {{it is essential to}} obtain a certain and uniform width of the SWNT electrode. To ensure uniform width manually, a small flux and longer time are necessary. Moreover, it is difficult to control the width of the electrode for the randomness of manual spraying. Therefore, a new type of <b>automatic</b> <b>spraying</b> process is presented in this paper. The width and homogeneity of the electrode can be easily controlled by certain parameters of the process. Two methods for detecting the homogeneity of the electrode are introduced in this paper: Measurement of surface resistance and luminosity.

Significance The product surface coating is a very essential working procedure, especially the surface coating thickness even directly influences the outward appearance and the quality of products. Some factory operators grasp the spray gun to carry on the spraying to the hemisphere surface object,this operation causes the surface distance of spray gunis large to the hemisphere surface object. The rotation of the spray gun makes surfacecoating non-uniform. It is easy to cause the phenomenon of missing spraying,this causes the defective rate to stay at a high level, spray coating efficiency is low, it influences productivity seriously. In this design,we use the chain drive to lead the rising and rotaing mechanism that makes the waiting spraying hemispheresurface objects pass the spray gun work area, in two rows along the straight line, at the uniform speed.

40|$|Abstract. The Rapid Prototyping (R. P.) {{technology}} {{which is}} used in manufacturing a three-dimensional solid part {{is based on the}} layer forming method. Currently, the main streams of commercially available machines use the point or line forming method to create the solid part. A thin polymeric material layer is delivered by a roller or scraper to form a thin material layer for further layer forming. This process won’t be able to control the size of the forming part. In this paper, “Liquid Spray Process ” is proposed to use a spray pen to spread a thin layer of polymeric material on the forming bed for further layer forming in a rapid prototyping system. It will decrease time and cost of the current R. P. machines by spreading proper size of thin forming bed.

Furthermore, the Taguchi Methods were applied to find the optimal spray forming parameters including height, velocity, acceleration, control air pressure, atomizing air pressure, fluid flow of spray, material pressure and speed of gear pump. Finally, the minimum uniform coating thickness could reach as low as 25 µm with “Liquid Spray Process ” when the optimal parameters were used. The uniformity could be well maintained for both sprays in cross or in parallel directions to form an area of 120 mm × 150 mm with the optimal parameters...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{elucidate}} the effects of the important spray characteristics on the surface morphology and light absorbance of spray-on P 3 HT:PCBM thin-films, used as an active layer in polymer solar cells (PSCs). Spray coating or deposition is a viable scalable technique for the large-scale, fast, and low-cost fabrication of solution-processed solar cells, and has been widely used for device fabrication, although the fundamental understanding of the underlying and controlling parameters, such as spray characteristics, droplet dynamics, and surface wettability, is still limited, making the results on device fabrication not reproducible and unreliable. In this paper, following the conventional PSC architecture, a PEDOT:PSS layer is first spin-coated on glass substrates, followed by the deposition of P 3 HT:PCBM using an <b>automatic</b> ultrasonic <b>spray</b> coating system, with a movable nozzle tip, to mimic an industrial manufacturing process. To gain insight, the effects of the spray carrier air pressure, the number of spray passes, the precursor flow rate, and precursor concentration are studied on the surface topography and light absorbance spectra of the spray-on films. Among the results, it is found that despite the high roughness of spray-on films, the light absorbance of the film is satisfactory. It is also found that the absorbance of spray-on films is a linear function of the number of spray passes or deposition layers, based on which an effective film thickness is defined for rough spray-on films.

50|$|Fog nozzles play an {{important}} part in firefighting tactics due to their versatility. The wide variety of fog nozzle manufacturers allows them to accommodate different sizes of fire hose- most often attack hand line- and streams and are capable in both fire protection and attack. With regard to flow rate, it is imperative to be sure that each fog nozzle be able to handle the flow rate of its water supply because the master stream devices to which they are sometimes attached can expel up to 2000 gal per minute. Nevertheless, as with almost all fog nozzles, those on master stream devices come with either <b>automatic</b> or manual <b>spray</b> pattern and stream adjustments. However, one significant disadvantage of fog nozzles is that Compressed Air Foam (CAF) bubbles' ratio of surface area to volume (which are formed by mixing air into a solution of water and foaming agents at the pump) exceeds that of fog nozzles' water droplets; therefore, the mechanical deflection in the nozzles themselves causes a loss of bubble structure, thereby reducing the CAF's ability to absorb heat. Despite this drawback, provided an appropriate nozzle pressure and water supply, fog nozzles are effective for any ground fire situation.|$|R

HPCI is designed to inject substantial quantities of water into the reactor while it is at high pressure so as to prevent the activation of the <b>automatic</b> depressurization, core <b>spray,</b> and low-pressure coolant injection systems. HPCI is powered by steam from the reactor, and takes approximately 10 seconds to spin up from an initiating signal, and can deliver approximately 19,000 L/min (5,000 US gal/min) to the core at any core pressure above 6.8 atm (690 kPa, 100 psi). This is usually enough to keep water levels sufficient to avoid automatic depressurization except in a major contingency, such as a large break in the makeup water line. HPCI is also able to be run in [...] "pressure control mode", where the HPCI turbine is run without pumping water to the reactor vessel. This allows HPCI to remove steam from the reactor and slowly depressurize it without the need for operating the safety or relief valves. This minimizes the number of times the relief valves need to operate, and reduces the potential for one sticking open and causing a small LOCA.|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of weeds in agriculture {{is a time}} consuming and expensive activity, including in Australia where the predominant strategy is blanket spraying of herbicides. This approach wastes herbicide by applying it in areas {{where there are no}} weeds. Discrimination of different plant species can be performed based on the spectral reflectance of the leaves. This thesis describes the development of a sensor for <b>automatic</b> spot <b>spraying</b> of weeds within crop rows. The sensor records the relative intensity of reflected light in three narrow wavebands using lasers as an illumination source. A prototype weed sensor which had been previously developed was evaluated and redesigned to improve its plant discrimination performance. A line scan image sensor replacement was chosen which reduced the noise in the recorded spectral reflectance properties. The switching speed of the laser sources was increased by replacing the laser drivers. The optical properties of the light source were improved to provide a more uniform illumination across the viewing area of the sensor. A new opto-mechanical system was designed and constructed with the required robustness to operate the weed sensor in outdoor conditions. Independent operation of the sensor was made possible by the development of hardware and software for an embedded controller which operated the opto-electronic components and performed plant discrimination. The first revised prototype was capable of detecting plants at a speed of 10 km/h in outdoor conditions with the sensor attached to a quad bike. However, it was not capable of discriminating different plants. The final prototype included a line scan sensor with increased dynamic range and pixel resolution as well as improved stability of the output laser power. These changes improved the measurement of spectral reflectance properties of plants and provided reliable discrimination of three different broadleaved plants using only three narrow wavelength bands. A field trial with the final prototype demonstrated successful discrimination of these three different plants at 5 km/h when a shroud was used to block ambient light. A survey of spectral reflectance of four crops (sugarcane, cotton, wheat and sorghum) and the weeds growing amongst these crops was conducted to determine the potential for use of the prototype weed sensor to control spot-spraying of herbicides. Visible reflectance spectra were recorded from individual leaves using a fibre spectrometer throughout the growing season for each crop. A discriminant analysis was conducted based on six narrow wavebands extracted from leaf level spectral reflectance measured with a spectrometer. The analysis showed the potential to discriminate cotton and sugarcane fro...|$|R
40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsTerry GriffinLarge acreage {{farms and}} even {{moderate}} sized farms employing custom applicators and harvesters have multiple {{machines in the}} same field {{at the same time}} conducting the same field operation. As a method to control input costs and minimize application overlap, these machines have been equipped with automatic section control (ASC). For nearly all these multiple-vehicle operations, over application is a concern especially for more irregularly shaped fields; however modern technology including automated guidance combined with automatic section control allow reduced doubling of input application including seeds, fertilizer, and <b>spray.</b> <b>Automatic</b> section control depends on coverage maps stored locally on each vehicle {{to determine whether or not}} to apply input products and up to now, there has not been a clear method to share these maps between vehicles in the same field. Without sharing coverage maps, an individual ASC planting unit only has location data where it has applied individually and no location data for where other planting units have applied seed in that same field. Automatic section control relies upon shared coverage maps to be continually updated between each planting unit and utilizes existing machine telematics infrastructure for map data sharing. Telematics utilizes a cloud computing platform and cellular connectivity which in rural areas is known to have limited service levels. Planting operations were simulated for two 16 -row planters, each using two John Deere GreenStar 3 2630 monitors, simulated GPS location data stream, electronic rate control units, and individual row unit clutches to have control at the finest granularity. Each simulated planting unit is equipped with automatic section control and telematics gateways to share coverage map data from the first planting unit to JDLink cloud infrastructure then out to the second. This study evaluates the impact that field size and shape have on using multiple ASC planters and coverage map sharing, and estimates seed cost savings from reducing over application because coverage maps are shared between planting units. The impact of sharing coverage maps with both planting units using field boundaries with automatic section control and without using field boundaries were evaluated. Guidance line headings were determined using AgLeader SMS’s mission planning feature to minimize the number of passes across each field based on the field boundary and implement width. Each field was run twice using parallel tracking, once each with and without coverage map sharing to observe the extent of over application. The field level data were then taken to examine a fictious 3, 000 acre farming operation where the field level data was used as a partial composition of the farm operation. An embedded Microsoft Excel macro was used to create 8, 008 different composition scenarios to determine farm level savings. The average farm savings was $ 58, 909 per year. Additionally, using the 8, 008 scenarios, time value of money was examined to determine the the minimum area required annually for five years for this technology to pay back. The average was 133 acres each year for five years. Equipment manufacturers and farmers have interest in these results. In general, equipment manufacturers desire to create a service-based product to be sold such that continual revenue path provides value added services after the precision agriculture hardware is sold. In this study, the existing telematics product offerings are tied to shared coverage maps to provide a value-add to an existing service. Farmers want to ensure this is a sound equipment investment with payback in a relatively short time period. As farm input costs continue to rise especially relative to crop prices, reducing over application will be critical to limit waste...|$|R
