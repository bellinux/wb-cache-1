40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} effect of {{straight}} debt issuance announcements on credit default swap (CDS) spreads. As leverage-increasing capital structure decisions, debt issuances should result in increases <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> risk, and thus in CDS and credit spreads. Leverage is, after all, both theoretically and empirically an important determinant <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> risk. However, previous literature fails to show {{a significant effect on}} credit spreads around debt issuances. When does price <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> risk occur if not around the announcement? In order to increase understanding on the issue, this study has two main objectives: to examine the debt issuance announcement effect on CDS spreads, and to identify potential debt and company specific determinants on these effects. The data set used in this study consists of daily spread data of 182 CDSs of 83 companies, and 377 straight debt issuances of these companies. The time period covered spans from January 2008 to December 2013. The announcement effects are sought after with event study methodology. The observed CDS spread changes are compared with predictions of a normal spread change model built on reduced form models <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> risk. Non-parametric statistical tests are used for assessing the significance of the results. Additionally, to see whether announcement effects can be explained with debt- and company-specific factors, a linear regression model is built. The main factors studied are company sector and asset-based solvency, and relative issue size and maturity. The analysis indicates that straight debt issuance announcements have a statistically significant positive effect on CDS spreads. This effect results in an increase of 5. 5 %, on average, over the selected event window, [- 20, 20]. The announcement effects are significantly larger for subordinated CDSs than they are for senior CDSs. The effect occurs gradually over the event window, and suggests a lasting increase in CDSs. Debt issuances are clearly anticipated, but price adjustment in CDS markets seems slow and inefficient. The dynamics <b>of</b> CDS price <b>adjustment</b> are <b>of</b> great interest for future research. The tested linear regression models performed poorly in explaining the announcement effects, as {{only a small fraction of}} the variation in these effects could be explained with the model. However, some implications can be extracted from estimated coefficients. Announcement effects increase with issue size for non-financial companies issuing short-term debt. Additionally, the effects decrease with asset-based solvency for financial companies...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} {{crisis and the}} bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008 lead to harder regulations for the banking industry which included larger capital reserves for the banks. One of the parts that contributed to this increased capital reserve was the the credit valuation adjustment capital charge which can be explained as {{the market value of}} the counterparty default risk. The purpose <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> valuation <b>adjustment</b> capital charge is to capitalize the risk of future changes in the market value of the counterparty default risk. One financial contract that had {{a key role in the}} {{financial crisis}} was the credit default swap. A credit default swap involves three different parts, a contract seller, a contract buyer and a reference entity. The credit default swap can be seen as an insurance against a credit event, a default for example of the reference entity. This thesis focuses on the study and calculation <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> valuation <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> default swaps. The credit valuation adjustment on a credit default swap can be implemented with two different assumptions. In the first case, the seller (buyer) of the contract is assumed to be default risk free and then only the buyer (seller) contributes to the default risk. In the second case, both the seller and the buyer of the contract is assumed to be default risky and therefore, both parts contributes to the default risk. Finanskrisen och Lehman Brothers konkurs 2008 ledde till hårdare regleringar för banksektorn som bland annat innefattade krav på större kapitalreserver för bankerna. En del som bidrog till denna ökning av kapitalreserverna var kreditvärdighetsjusteringens kapitalkrav som kan förklaras som marknadsvärdet av motpartsrisken. Syftet med kreditvärdighetsjusteringens kapitalkrav är att kapitalisera risken för framtida förändringar i marknadsvärdet av motpartsrisken. Ett derivat som hade en nyckelroll under finanskrisen var kreditswappen. En kreditswap innefattar tre parter, en säljare, en köpare och ett referensföretag. Kreditswappen kan ses som en försäkring mot en kredithändelse, till exempel en konkurs på referensföretaget. Detta arbete fokuserar på studier och beräkningar av kreditvärdesjusteringen på kreditswappar. Kreditvärdesjusteringen på en kreditswap kan implementeras med två olika antaganden. I det första fallet antas säljaren (köparen) vara riskfri och då bidrar bara köparen (säljaren) till konkursrisken. I det andra fallet antas både säljaren och köparen bidra till konkursrisken...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{number of}} {{bankruptcy}} announcements means that even greater attention {{is being paid}} to the correct evaluation of the probability of default (PD) and decisions {{made on the basis}} of it. Reli-able estimation of the likelihood of a company’s bankruptcy reduces risk, not only for the company itself but also for all co-operating companies and financial institutions. The financial crisis has led to a tightening up of the conditions for gaining finance from banks. However, it is not only the evalua-tion of PD itself that is so important but also the correct classification of companies according to their PD level (“good ” or “bad ” companies). There is very little consideration about possible <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> risk scale, as usually the American scale is adopted with no changes which seems incor-rect. This paper stresses the importance of correct calibration <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> rating scale. It should not be assumed (as it was in the past) that once a scale is defined it remains fixed and independent of the country. Therefore, the research carried out on Polish companies shows that the credit rating scale should be changed and the default point (i. e. “cut-off ” point) should be higher than in the past. The author uses a modified classification matrix based on the probability of default. The paper compares the classification of quoted Polish companies according to their credit risk level (PD) with the actual occurrence of default when various default “cut-off ” points are used.

The model is consistent with empirical evidence that documents the important role of substitution effects between different sources <b>of</b> external <b>credit.</b> Producers respond to financial shocks by switching the type of finance.

Housebanks obtain more collateral and provide more finance. Caused by money illusion in times of high market interest rates loan rate premiums are relatively small whereas in times of low market interest rates they are relatively high.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} problem <b>of</b> {{computing}} <b>adjustments</b> for bilateral counterparty {{risk for a}} standard Credit Default Swap (CDS) in a three-factor first passage time default risk model. Extending the existing literature that gives analytical expression for the transition probability density function for two-dimensional Brownian motions absorbed at the boundaries in the positive quadrant, a method to obtain a semi-analytical expression for the transition probability density function of a three-dimensional Brownian motion absorbed at first exit time from the positive octant is developed. This is done by separating the problem into a radial and an angular part, of which the latter depends only on the correlation matrix. The solution to the angular part is obtained through the finite element method. These mathematical results are then used to provide semi-analytical expressions for bilateral Credit Value Adjustment (CVA) and Debit Value <b>Adjustments</b> (DVA) <b>of</b> a <b>credit</b> default swap. An example of market data is analysed in detail and it is shown that these value adjustments can be non-negligible. An approximation commonly used by practitioners for the computation <b>of</b> bilateral value <b>adjustments</b> {{is to use the}} sum of the unilateral ones as a proxy. The framework developed here allows for an analysis on the precision of this approximation to be performed in the case <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> default swap, when wrong-way risk is present.

The available literature on the subject is scanty, controversial and inconclusive. The paper holds that credit creation per se is not un-Islamic; the essential point is how credit is generated and used. It argues that credit creation cannot be banished; it is an imperative for frictionless <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> money supply to unavoidable fluctuations in its demand in modern economies. It seeks to correct the misunderstanding in the literature that banks create credit ex nihilo. Demand for money apart, fiscal policies and foreign exchange transaction erode the <b>credit</b> controlling power <b>of</b> the central banks. The paper blames major difficulties including those <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> creation and control {{on the evolution of}} Islamic banking on the same pattern as its mainstream counterpart and suggests some structural modifications. Finally, it finds the conventional weapons <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> control inefficacious for use in an interest free banking system and suggests the inclusion of a ratio of cash to bank advances among them.
