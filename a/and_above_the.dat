5|$|Compared {{to earlier}} works of this type, Christ's body is more {{physically}} corporeal, {{depicted as a}} real object, and his anatomy more closely rendered. His hands and feet seem to extend beyond the pictorial space, which is delineated by the flat, coloured borders of the cross, in turn made up of at least six boards. Both Christ's body and his semi-circular nimbus are placed at angles which rise outwards <b>and</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> level of the cross.|$|E
5|$|The Gatehouse {{is reached}} across a wooden bridge, {{incorporating}} a drawbridge. Burges intended {{the bridge to}} copy those of medieval castles, which he believed were designed to be easily set on fire {{in the event of}} attack. The Gatehouse was fitted with a wooden defensive bretache <b>and,</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> entrance, Burges sited a portcullis and a glazed statue of the Madonna and Child sculpted by Ceccardo Fucigna.|$|E
5|$|At street level, three arched entranceways line Broad Street. The central arch is {{slightly}} larger than the others to indicate {{the entrance to the}} main banking hall. Carved into the facade above the center arch is the building's name. Inside the arches <b>and</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> doorways are windows designed by d'Ascenzo Studios. Leaded panes of glass of various shades of amber are surrounded by a Renaissance-style border. Below the windows are bronze doors, each with 24 high-relief panels depicting the history of commerce and civilization. Bas-relief figures decorate each of the arches' spandrels. A male figure with a hammer representing industry and a female figure with a beehive representing thrift decorate the center arch. The arch closest to Sansom Street is decorated by two figures with cornucopias to represent abundance. The arch nearer to Walnut Street is decorated by a painter and a sculptor to represent art.|$|E

5|$|From October 1928 onward, Mufti Amin al-Husayni {{organised}} {{a series}} of measures to demonstrate the Arabs' exclusive claims to the Temple Mount and its environs. He ordered new construction next to <b>and</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> Western Wall. The British granted the Arabs permission to convert a building adjoining the Wall into a mosque and to add a minaret. A muezzin was appointed to perform the Islamic call to prayer and Sufi rites directly next to the Wall. These were seen as a provocation by the Jews who prayed at the Wall. The Jews protested and tensions increased.|$|E
5|$|Grove lists {{more than}} thirty works by Vaughan Williams for {{orchestra}} or band over <b>and</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> symphonies. They include two of his most popular works—the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis (1910, revised 1919), and The Lark Ascending, originally for violin and piano (1914); orchestrated 1920. Other works that survive in the repertoire in Britain are the Norfolk Rhapsody No 1 (1905–06), The Wasps, Aristophanic suite—particularly the overture (1909), the English Folk Song Suite (1923) and the Fantasia on Greensleeves (1934).|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{north of}} Regent Street is the BBC's headquarters, Broadcasting House, whose front {{entrance}} is in Langham Place. Several national radio stations are broadcast from this building. The site had formerly been a {{building on the}} gardens of Foley House designed by James Wyatt and called Wyatt's House. It was demolished in 1928 (with much of the fixtures ending up in the Victoria and Albert Museum) to construct Broadcasting House. Construction was challenging because the building had to be visually similar to other properties on Regent Street, yet also contain over twenty soundproofed studios. The exterior is built of Portland stone <b>and</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> front entrance is a sculpture by Eric Gill.|$|E

In Santa Beatriz, he took off piloting the first aircraft flight in Peru, flying over Lima, Callao <b>and</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean coast. The flight was witnessed by the President of Peru Augusto B. Leguía and other dignitaries. On 29 January he completed a 20-minute flight from Lima to Ancón, a day {{before he became a}} flight instructor in the first flying school in South America. In early 1911 he became Peruvian Aviation Corps (PAC) colonel and {{returned to}} France as an air force envoy.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians sent 8,000 hoplites, led by Aristides, {{along with}} 600 Plataean exiles {{to join the}} Allied army. The army then marched in Boeotia across the passes of Mount Cithaeron, {{arriving}} near Plataea, <b>and</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> Persian position on the Asopus. Under {{the guidance of the}} commanding general, Pausanias, the Greeks took up position opposite the Persian lines but remained on high ground. Knowing that he had little hope of successfully attacking the Greek positions, Mardonius sought to either sow dissension among the Allies or lure them down into the plain. Plutarch reports that a conspiracy was discovered among some prominent Athenians, who were planning to betray the Allied cause; although this account is not universally accepted, it may indicate Mardonius' attempts of intrigue within the Greek ranks.|$|E

5|$|The {{gatehouse}} in {{the centre}} of the south curtain wall mostly dates from the 13thcentury. It was originally accessed via a drawbridge and visitors had to pass through two gates, one {{at either end of the}} passage, and a portcullis. The semi-octagonal projections on either side of the gate passage are considered ornamental. Between the projections <b>and</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> gate were machicolations, openings for missiles to be hurled at attackers. The rooms on either side of the passage were guardrooms. The only remaining openings on the front are slits at ground level. Slits on the other sides of the gatehouse, and along the entrance passage, allowed the gatekeeper to watch people approaching and entering the castle. The structure underwent later alterations in the 19th and 20thcenturies when it housed the castle's custodian; slits in the gatehouse's front may have been filled in.|$|E
5|$|The lungs of {{lungfish}} {{are similar}} to those of amphibians, with few, if any, internal septa. In the Australian lungfish, there is only a single lung, albeit divided into two lobes. Other lungfish and Polypterus, however, have two lungs, which are located in the upper part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around <b>and</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> esophagus. The blood supply also twists around the esophagus, suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body, as in other vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} position of eyes is highly variable within the species. For example, eye location ranges from being completely within the antennal scrobes to completely outside the scrobes. In {{some cases the}} eye itself is located outside the antennal scrobe, but the eye's fossa is well marked and confluent with the antennal scrobe. In most specimens, the antennal carina (ridge extending along the dorsal antennal region) bifurcates from the antennal scrobes and lies straight above the eyes. However, in specimens from Nicaragua, a strongly impressed antennal carina is present. In these specimens about 40% of the eye's area lies within the antennal scrobes. In the gyne, only ~1/6 of the eye lies within the antennal scrobes. A depression sometimes forms in the integument in {{the sides of the}} propodeum, below the propodeal spiracle <b>and</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> metapleural gland. The depth of this depression varies among specimens and tends to be deepest in larger specimens.|$|E

5|$|The south (front) face of {{the eastern}} wing has seven bays, with a balustraded parapet at eaves level. The central bay is set forward to form a stone centrepiece around the arched main {{entrance}}, which is flanked by fluted Ionic columns. Immediately above the entrance are doubled tapering pilasters flanking a three-light window, all surmounted by a large cartouche decorated with strapwork. On {{the first floor of}} the central bay is a triple-mullion window, <b>and</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> parapet is a coat of arms. Flanking the centrepiece are two bays with diapered brickwork and single-mullion windows. The two ends of the south face are also set forward; they have canted, triple-mullion bay windows and are surmounted above the parapet by shaped gables with attic windows. All the main windows of this face are double transomed.|$|E
5|$|There {{are reasons}} that seamounts are biologically important. They rise {{high in the}} water column, {{creating}} complex current patterns that support life on, around, <b>and</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> seamount. The surface of the seamount also provides a substrate upon which organisms can attach themselves and grow. This in turn supports the species that feed on them, in turn supporting the whole ecological food web. Scientists have found that seamounts often provide a habitat for endemic species that are not found anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|To {{either side}} of the {{pedestal}} are matching panels onto which are inscribed the names of the village's war dead. At the same height are flanking walls of coarsed, squared rubble from the nearby Doulting Stone Quarry, set back at the ends and topped with a yew hedge. In front of each wall is a small stone bench that protrudes across the base of the column, <b>and</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> benches, fixed to the wall, are round plaques bearing the dates of the Second World War and the names of the village's dead from that conflict. The statue and the inscriptions are both the work of Eric Gill, who also carved the memorial to Raymond Asquith. Colin Amery, who chaired an exhibition of Lutyens' works after his death, describes the memorials at Mells as among Lutyens' finest.|$|E
