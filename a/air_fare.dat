25|$|John Casey {{expanded}} Braniff's capacity {{during the}} summer of 1981. An unforeseen strike by the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) caused delays and a decrease in traffic that created large losses for Braniff. Casey then implemented the Braniff Strikes Back Campaign in the fall of 1981, streamlining the carrier's <b>air</b> <b>fare</b> structure into a simplified two-tier fare system. As part of this campaign, some Boeing 727s were divided into Braniff Premier Service (traditional First Class service) and Coach Class. The remainder of the 727s were all-Coach Class with reduced fares. The campaign was not successful, pushing Braniff's bread-and-butter business travelers over to traditional airlines with First Class on all flights.|$|E

2500|$|Thaksin {{was accused}} of [...] "policy corruption", such as {{infrastructure}} and liberalisation policies that, while legal and a potential benefit to society, also aided companies that were owned by his family members. Supannee Chai-amporn and Sirinthip Arun-rue of the National Institute of Development Administration claimed that policy corruption caused the state to spend nearly 30 per cent more than it otherwise should have spent, costing the state an additional 400billion baht. Other examples cited were the Board of Investment's granting tax breaks worth a total of THB16.4billion to Shin Satellite for its iPSTAR project in 2003, and the Transport Ministry's decision the same year to abolish the minimum <b>air</b> <b>fare</b> of THB3.8 /km when Shin Corp was about {{to enter into a}} joint venture with low-cost carrier AirAsia to open a Thai subsidiary.|$|E

40|$|A {{spate of}} recent fare {{increases}} has {{focused attention on}} the airline industry's competitiveness. Many analysts are concerned about continuing changes in the industry {{in the wake of}} its consolidation in the last few years. The authors examine the competitiveness issue by developing a model for the determinants of <b>air</b> <b>fares.</b> They find that, controlling for other important factors, <b>air</b> <b>fares</b> are lower on routes that have more caniers offering service, although most of the decrease in fares is achieved once two or three carriers offer service...|$|R

40|$|This article investigates to {{what extent}} an airline's {{financial}} distress impacts its pricing behavior. While prior research suggests that, on average, distressed airlines sell at lower fares, it is hypothesized that {{the magnitude of this}} effect may depend on certain firm and market specific contingencies. A large-scale empirical analysis using panel data from the US airline industry is conducted. The results indicate that firm financial distress and <b>air</b> <b>fares</b> are generally negatively related. It is further shown that the magnitude of the effect of distress on fares decreases with the magnitude of operating costs and firm's market shares and increases with firm size and the level of market concentration. Implications for policy makers and managers are discussed. US airline industry Financial distress <b>Air</b> <b>fares</b> Contingency approach...|$|R
