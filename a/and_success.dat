5|$|Patton's {{colorful}} image, hard-driving personality <b>and</b> <b>success</b> as {{a commander}} were at times overshadowed by his controversial public statements.

His strong emphasis on rapid and aggressive offensive action proved effective. While Allied leaders held sharply differing opinions on Patton, he was regarded highly by his opponents in the German High Command. A popular, award-winning biographical film released in 1970 helped transform Patton into an American hero.|$|E

5|$|Rocco Landesman, {{chairperson}} of the National Endowment for the Arts, has used Citygarden {{as an example of}} a successful foundation-funded art venture. Landesman—a former resident of St. Louis—said that such projects can help urban areas economically, but they cannot be funded solely by the federal government, thus requiring assistance from both the private sector and foundations. Michael Van Valkenburgh, principal of a Brooklyn landscape architecture firm, said he was drawn to St. Louis partly because of Citygarden's design <b>and</b> <b>success.</b> Van Valkenburgh was selected in 2010 to renovate the grounds of the Gateway Arch.|$|E
3000|$|Above we {{have argued}} that {{subjective}} career success has to be distinguished for self-referent <b>and</b> other-referent <b>success.</b> We have further reported findings that correlations between objective <b>success</b> <b>and</b> other-referent <b>success</b> are always positive, whereas the empirical correlation between objective <b>success</b> <b>and</b> self-referent <b>success</b> (job satisfaction) is equivocal. Our second research question therefore concerns the interrelationship of objective career success with self-referent vs. other-referent subjective success. We expect stronger correlations between other-referent subjective career <b>success</b> <b>and</b> objective career <b>success</b> than between self-referent subjective career <b>success</b> <b>and</b> objective career <b>success.</b> Besides the above-mentioned empirical findings we base this assumption on the following reasoning: Comparing own attainments with others' attainments needs [...] a comparison standard that can be externally inferred, for instance salary or promotion. The assessment of one's own satisfaction, on the other hand, can be based on many standards, and salary {{is only one of}} them.|$|R
