In a letter to Liliuokalani, Kalākaua described how his romantic boyhood dreams of sailing the Red Sea were dashed by the tedium of <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water with no land in sight. All was not lost, since he and the estimated 70 other passengers passed the week playing games and dancing.|$|E

He self-published {{the book on the}} advice of Emerson, using Emerson's publisher, Munroe, who did little to publicize the book.|$|E

When Lorca's brother-in-law, Manuel Fernández-Montesinos, agreed to accept the position, he was assassinated within <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> same day he was shot, 18 August, Lorca was arrested.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} {{redundancy}} {{is based on}} a length of service calculation and age. For each year you have worked while you were under 21 years old, you get half a week's pay. For each year between ages 21 and 40, one week's pay. For each year over 40, one and a half week's pay (s.162). However, there is an upper limit set on what can be considered a week's pay, which is approximately the same as <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> minimum wage (if you were made redundant on or before 31 January 2011, it was £380 per week - from 1 February 2011 to 31 January 2012, it was £400 - currently it is £450, before tax).|$|E
25|$|In early 2005, Farage {{requested}} that the European Commission disclose where the individual Commissioners had spent their holidays. The Commission did not provide the information requested, {{on the basis that}} the Commissioners had a right of privacy. The German newspaper Die Welt reported that the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, had spent <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> yacht of the Greek shipping billionaire Spiros Latsis. It emerged soon afterwards that this had occurred a month before the Commission under Barroso's predecessor Romano Prodi approved 10.3 million euros of Greek state aid for Latsis's shipping company. It also became known that Peter Mandelson, then the British EU Commissioner, had accepted a trip to Jamaica from an unrevealed source.|$|E

The company has subsequently added password protection to its site.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Die Welt {{reported}} that Barroso had spent <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> yacht of the Greek shipping billionaire Spiro Latsis. It emerged soon afterwards {{that this had}} occurred only {{a month before the}} Commission approved 10million euros of Greek state aid for Latsis's shipping company – though the state aid decision had been taken by the previous European Commission before Barroso took up his post. In response to this revelation, Nigel Farage MEP of the UK Independence Party persuaded around 75 MEPs from across the political spectrum to back a motion of no confidence in Barroso, so as to compel him to appear before the European Parliament to be questioned on the matter. The motion was tabled on 12 May 2005, and Barroso appeared before Parliament as required at a debate on 26 May 2005. The motion itself was heavily defeated.|$|E

500|$|The final {{writer on}} the film was Christopher Fry. Charlton Heston has claimed that Fry was Wyler's first choice as screenwriter, but that Zimbalist forced him to use Vidal. Whether Fry worked on the script before Vidal or not, sources agree that Fry arrived in Rome in early May 1958 and spent six days <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set, writing and {{rewriting}} lines of dialogue as well as entire scenes, until the picture was finished. In particular, Fry gave the dialogue a slightly more formal and archaic tone without making it sound stilted and medieval. A highly publicized bitter dispute later broke out over screenplay credits to the film, involving Wyler, Tunberg, Vidal, Fry and the Screen Writers' Guild. In 1996, the Los Angeles Times published a brief letter from Charlton Heston taking issue with Vidal's claims which, he wrote, [...] "irritates {{the hell out of}} me". Three months later the paper published a 1,200 word response from Vidal, which included the statement that, with regard to the controversial scene's subtext, he had been delegated to inform Boyd (who was [...] "delighted"), but that Wyler had warned [...] "don't tell Chuck because he'll fall apart".|$|E
