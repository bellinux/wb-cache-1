Prior studies examined provisional balloting <b>at</b> <b>Indiana’s</b> 2008 primary and 2008 general elections. This article presents results from the 2012 primary and proceeds in two parts. Part I briefly discusses the details of Indiana’s photo identification law, the various methods used to measure the impact of photo identification laws generally, and the research methods employed for this study.
