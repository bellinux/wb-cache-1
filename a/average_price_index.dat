This paper estimates the evolution of equilibrium real home prices in the United States and finds that despite recent declines, single-family homes remained 8 to 20 percent overvalued as of the first quarter of 2008. In the short run, the gap between actual and equilibrium prices does not exert powerful influence over price dynamics.

Calculation of price and quantities indexes of procured oncology medicines via centralized tenders for the period 2000 - 2003. RESULTS : The tenders are organized in Macedonia by the Health insurance fund for all levels of health care and all medicines included in the procurament list while in Bulgaria Ministry of health is organizing a central drug procurament for 121 INN life - saving and expensive medicines dispensed via specialized clinics.

40|$|Aim of study: To {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to defining rotation ages on the basis of productive and technological aspects and to present an example of application of the methodology to natural Pinus sylvestris stands in relation to silvicultural treatment (light or heavy thinning) and site index. Area of study: Central Spain. Material and methods: We assumed that the price per m 3 of logwood suitable for veneer is four times higher than logwood not apt for veneer. Considering the yield distribution for different technological and commercial classes, a model of diameter distributions and yield tables, the variation in an <b>average</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> for different age classes, site indexes and silvicultural treatments was calculated. The age at which the price index rises by less than 3 %, the proportion of trees with d. b. h. higher than 40 cm, and other aspects such as the possible presence of fungal decay in old-growth stands were also taken into account to establish three criteria for defining rotation ages. Main results: The proposed methodology generates a wide range of rotation ages between 100 and 140 years for lightly thinned stands, and between 90 and 140 years for heavily thinned stands, depending on the site index. Research highlights: The proposed approach is based on technological and productive criteria, with the limitations imposed by sanitary risks. The methodology can be applied to generate rotation ages in relation to different site indexes and silvicultural treatments, provided that the timber market prices and the yield distribution for different technological and commercial classes are known, and that a model of diameter distributions and yield tables are available...|$|E

40|$|The {{index of}} {{agricultural}} goods output comprises weighted changes of prices of agricultural commodities whereas {{the index of}} intermediate consumption describes fluctuations of outlays’ prices such as seeds and planting stock, energy, fertilizers, soil improvers, plant protection products or feedingstuffs. The relation of these two indices is defined as “price gap” or “price scissors”. There {{is a lot of}} price models for agricultural goods investigated in the subject literature. However, the issue of modeling drivers for the price gap has been rarely explored. For that reason authors aim to estimate long-term regression models of the agricultural price gap for different European countries that represent varied agrarian structures. The analysis entails few stages. In the first stage, the long-term <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> (from 1980 to 2014) were computed basing on EUROSTAT and FAOSTAT agricultural prices data for all available agricultural products and outlays in the EU- 27 countries. Then, the aggregated indices were weighted with a volume of production or intermediate consumption {{on the basis of the}} <b>average</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> for the respective outputs or inputs. In the second stage, a cluster analysis was performed with regard to the utilization of a land factor by individual farms in the subsequent European countries. In the third stage, three countries were chosen for case studies from the each of the distinguished clusters and the econometric models of price gap were estimated where the indices of outputs and inputs are independent variables. An interesting finding was discovered that marginal effects for price gap drivers are much stronger in the countries of an intensive and large scale agriculture (as France, Great Britain and Denmark) than in the countries of fragmented agrarian structures such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland...|$|R

40|$|In {{empirical}} economic research, individual {{prices are}} often aggregated into <b>average</b> <b>prices</b> of sub-aggregates. Then, these <b>average</b> <b>prices</b> are aggregated {{to produce the}} <b>average</b> <b>price</b> of the total aggregate. Often, such two stage procedures help to illuminate the underlying forces driving the overall result. Since price data are usually published as price changes, this two stage aggregation is typically based on some <b>price</b> <b>index</b> formula.

It is argued that testing for weak consistency in aggregation is a particularly important screening device.

40|$|The {{consumer}} <b>price</b> <b>index</b> commonly computed {{by national}} statistical agencies {{can be interpreted}} as a weighted <b>average</b> of <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> for individual households, with the weights proportional to the total consumption expenditure of each household. In other words, the aggregate consumer <b>price</b> <b>index</b> is usually not a perfect indicator of the inflation experience of individual households. The extent to which household-specific inflation rates diverge from headline inflation generally depends on three things: 1) the divergence of consumption patterns across consumer units; 2) the divergence of expenditure budgets across households; and 3) the divergence of price developments across expenditure items. To estimate the divergence of groupspecific consumer <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> across Austrian households, we construct group-specific inflation rates for the period from 2000 to October 2008 and evaluate consumption patterns across household groups. Households were grouped using a mix of two characteristics: a) household composition (i. e. male/female singles; two adults; three or more adults; lone parents; three or more persons, including children); b) low, medium or high household income. The study finds households with lower total spending to have experienced a higher inflation rate than the “average” consumer in the period under review. The average gap was about – 0. 1 percentage points annually. Second, the inflation contribution of housing and food (including nonalcoholic beverages) was higher for lower-income groups. Third, higher-income households usually have a higher inflation share of transport than lower-income households.

We generalize earlier work by incorporating simultaneously the time, age and vintage effects of computer models into a fully saturated parameterization, and then develop a corresponding specification test procedure. While the simple arithmetic mean of prices of models by year reveals a price decline of about 11 % per year, use of a matched model procedure similar to that commonly used by government statistical agencies generates a much larger rate of price decline [...] about 20 % per year. Since the matched model procedure holds quality constant, it ignores quality change embodied in new models. When data on new and surviving models {{are used in the}} estimation of hedonic price equations, a variety of quality-adjusted <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> can be calculated, with varying interpretations. Although there are some differences, we find that on <b>average</b> these quality-adjusted <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> decline at about 30 % per year, with a particularly large price drop occurring in 1992. Parameters in hedonic price equations for desktop PC models differ from those for mobile PCs. Moreover, quality-adjusted prices fall at a slightly lower AAGR for mobile models (24 %) than for desktops (32 %).
