25|$|A devadasi's {{life after}} {{dedication}} was obviously very different centuries ago. Nowadays After dedication {{of a girl}} to the temple, she has to take bath every day {{early in the morning}} and should present herself at the temple during morning worship of Yellamma. She is not allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum. But she will bow to the deity from outside. Thereafter she sweeps compound of the temple. Every Tuesday and Friday she goes for yoga along with senior jogatis (yoga teachers). During this period she learns innumerable songs in praise of Yellamma and her son Parashurama. If she shows some aptitude to learn playing instruments she will be given training by her elder jogatis. In Yellampura and other villages Devadasis do not dance but this is performed by eunuch companions.

They form a small group <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> joga, from house to house on every Tuesday and Friday (Jogan Shankar, 1990).|$|E
