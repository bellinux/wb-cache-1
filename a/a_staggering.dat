5|$|Although she was {{a pioneer}} in the white-line woodcut {{technique}} and {{played a role in the}} development of abstract art in the United States, Lazzell's work faded into obscurity for a time. With a resurgence of interest in the modern print, and especially the white-line woodcut, Lazzell's popularity has surged lately.

5|$|A {{contract}} {{to build the}} ship that would become Agincourt was signed on 3June 1911, and its keel was laid on 14September 1911. The design called for <b>a</b> <b>staggering</b> fourteen 12-inch guns, something historian David Topliss attributed to political necessity: the ship had to appear more powerful to the Brazilian populace than her predecessors (with twelve 12-inch guns) but, without increasing the gun size, the only option left was increasing {{the total number of}} guns.|$|E
40|$|This paper revisits the {{association}} between firm value (as proxied by Tobin’s Q) and whether the firm has <b>a</b> <b>staggered</b> board. <b>As</b> is well known, in the cross-section firms with <b>a</b> <b>staggered</b> board {{tend to have a}} lower value. Using a comprehensive sample for 1978 – 2011, we show an opposite result in the time series: firms that adopt <b>a</b> <b>staggered</b> board increase in firm value, while de-staggering is associated with a decrease in firm value. We further show that the decision to adopt <b>a</b> <b>staggered</b> board seems endogenous, and related to an ex ante lower firm value, which helps reconciling the existing cross-sectional results to our novel time series results. To explain our new results, we explore potential incentive problems in the shareholder-manager relationship. Short-term oriented shareholders may generate myopic incentives for the firm to underinvest in risky long-term projects. In this case, <b>a</b> <b>staggered</b> board may helpfully insulate the board from opportunistic shareholder pressure. Consistent with this, we find that the adoption of <b>a</b> <b>staggered</b> board has <b>a</b> stronger positive association with firm value for firms where such incentive problems are likely more severe: firms with more R&D, more intangible assets, more innovative and larger and thus likely more complex firms...|$|R

5|$|Following Juventus's {{return to}} Serie A, Del Piero {{was locked in}} months of fractious {{negotiations}} over the signing of a new contract with Juventus' new management.

5|$|After the Third Battle of Ypres petered out in late 1917, the Western Front {{fell into}} its usual lull {{over the winter}} months. In early 1918, it became {{apparent}} to the Allies that a large German offensive was pending. This Spring Offensive commenced on 21 March 1918, with over one million men in three German armies striking hard near the junction between the French and British armies. The main effort of this offensive hit the British Fifth Army, which formed the right flank of the British front line. Struck <b>a</b> <b>staggering</b> blow, it began a rapid and at times panicked withdrawal. The key railway junction at Amiens was soon threatened.|$|E
5|$|China {{was also}} catapulted into {{the status of}} a major {{military}} power following the victory at Chosin, but the victory came with <b>a</b> <b>staggering</b> cost. With the escape of the US X Corps and the ROK I Corps, Mao's vision for Chosin was not realized, and the failure caused Song Shi-Lun to offer his resignation. At the same time, heavy casualties caused by both combat and poor logistical support destroyed much of the eight elite divisions under the 20th and the 27th Corps. Of those eight divisions, two divisions were forced to disband, and not until March 1951 did the 9th Army return to its normal strength and become combat effective. With the absence of nearly 40 percent of the Chinese forces in Korea in early 1951, the heavy Chinese losses at Chosin ultimately enabled the UN forces to maintain a foothold in Korea.|$|E

5|$|The early 2000s {{were seen}} as a time of {{transition}} in tennis, with older players retiring and a few players breaking through {{at the very top}} of the game. Roger Federer had first played on the ATP Tour aged 17 in 1998, finishing his first full ATP season the following year before finishing 2002 ranked sixth in the world, his first year-end ranking in the top 8. His breakthrough came in 2003 when he won his first Grand Slam tournament, and finished the year as world number 2 behind Andy Roddick. The following two years, he almost completely dominated, winning five of eight majors and losing just ten matches in 2004 and 2005. Between Wimbledon in 2005 and the US Open in 2007, Federer captured 8 of 10 majors with <b>a</b> <b>staggering</b> record of 67–2 in those tournaments.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{situation}} in Hungary had begun to deteriorate as the tide of the war began to turn decisively against Germany and its allies. Following the catastrophic Axis defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad (in which Hungarian troops fighting alongside German forces suffered <b>a</b> <b>staggering</b> 84% casualty rate) the regime of Miklos Horthy began secretly pursuing peace talks with the United States and the United Kingdom. Upon learning of Horthy's duplicity, Adolf Hitler ordered the occupation of Hungary by German troops in March 1944. The Wehrmacht quickly {{took control of the}} country and placed Horthy under house arrest. A pro-German puppet government was installed in Budapest, with actual power resting with the German military governor, SS-Brigadeführer Edmund Veesenmayer. With the Nazis now in control, the relative security from the Holocaust enjoyed by the Jews of Hungary came to an end. In April and May 1944 the Nazi regime and its accomplices began the mass deportation of Hungary's Jews to extermination camps in Nazi-occupied Poland. Under the personal leadership of SS-Obersturmbannführer Adolf Eichmann, who would later be tried and hanged in Israel for his major role in the implementation of the Nazis' Final Solution, deportations took place at a rate of 12,000 people per day.|$|E
5|$|After rejoining the Emperor at Champaubert, Nansouty {{took part}} to the Battle of Montmirail, where he was at first {{instructed}} to protect the artillery. He then joined in the attack of the Guard infantry on the farm of Ėpine-au-Bois, where he suddenly wheeled left with his men and fell upon unprepared enemy infantry, charging home, routing these troops and subsequently pursuing the fugitives. This combined attack of the Guard resulted in {{a great number of}} prisoners and captured enemy guns, with Nansouty receiving a light wound in the process. A part of his men then took {{part to the}} Battle of Château-Thierry, where the Emperor ordered the Guard cavalry to make a turning move against the enemy left, and where Nansouty's subordinates General Letort and Colonel Curély brilliantly broke several enemy squares. Then, on 14 February, Nansouty personally led a brilliant charge at the Battle of Vauchamps, where he supported Grouchy in a cavalry action that decided the battle. Charging Blücher's men from the front, Nansouty allowed Grouchy to magnificently fall behind the enemy columns, which they both then sabred and crushed, with the Guard cavalry subsequently participating in a highly successful pursuit. Enemy losses reached <b>a</b> <b>staggering</b> 9,000-10,000 casualties, with 25 cannons lost. The Emperor was radiant following this battle, but, by nightfall, his mood changed when he found out of the loss of some Guard horse artillerymen. These men had been captured during their march and it was reported that their capture resulted from General Guyot (one of Nansouty's subordinates) failing to provide an escort and a guide for them. In Nansouty's presence, a fuming Napoleon summoned Guyot and then chastised him for the repeated losses in cannon during the previous battles, as well as for various other shortcomings, such as failing to properly escort the Emperor. After an angry tirade, Napoleon promptly axed Guyot and announced to Nansouty that General Exelmans would replace Guyot at the helm of his Old Guard heavy cavalry. This episode apparently strained relations between Emperor Napoleon and General Nansouty.|$|E

40|$|The exact factorized {{ground state}} of a {{heterogeneous}} (ferrimagnetic) spin model which {{is composed of}} two spins (ρ, σ) has been presented in detail. The Hamiltonian is not necessarily translational invariant and the exchange couplings can be competing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic arbitrarily between different sub-lattices to build many practical models such as dimerized and tetramerized materials and ladder compounds. The condition to get a factorized ground state is investigated for non-frustrated spin models {{in the presence of}} a uniform and <b>a</b> <b>staggered</b> magnetic field. According to the lattice model structure we have categorized the spin models in two different classes and obtained their factorization conditions. The first class contains models in which their lattice structures do not provide a single uniform magnetic field to suppress the quantum correlations. Some of these models may have a factorized ground state {{in the presence of a}} uniform and <b>a</b> <b>staggered</b> magnetic field. However, in the second class there are several spin models in which their ground state could be factorized whether <b>a</b> <b>staggered</b> field is applied to the system or not. For the latter case, in the absence of <b>a</b> <b>staggered</b> field the factorizing uniform field is unique. However, the degrees of freedom for obtaining the factorization conditions are increased by adding <b>a</b> <b>staggered</b> magnetic field.
