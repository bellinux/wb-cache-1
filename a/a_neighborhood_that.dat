5|$|The {{majority}} of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in Morningside Heights on Seth Low's late-19th century {{vision of a}} university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts principles by architects McKim, Mead, and White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or , in Morningside Heights, New York City, <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>that</b> contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive underground tunnel system {{more than a century}} old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.|$|E
5|$|The tower sits at 401 North Wabash Avenue in the River North Gallery District, {{part of the}} Near North Side {{community}} area of Chicago. The building {{occupies the}} site vacated by the Chicago Sun-Times, one of the city's two major newspapers, and its location within the River North Gallery District places it in <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>that</b> has had {{a high concentration of}} art galleries since the 1980s. The site, at the foot of Rush Street, is {{on the north side of}} the Chicago River just west of the Wrigley Building and the Michigan Avenue Bridge, and just east of Marina City and 330 North Wabash. The building is close to numerous Chicago landmarks; it borders the Michigan-Wacker District, which is a Registered Historic District. Parts of the building are visible throughout the city, and the entire length of the building is visible from boats on the river, as well as from locations to the east along the river, such as the mouth of Lake Michigan, the Lake Shore Drive Overpass, and the Columbus Drive Bridge.|$|E

25|$|Gouverneur Hospital {{opened in}} 1885, in a three-story {{building}} in Manhattan's Financial District. It was New York City's 19th municipal hospital, serving {{residents of the}} Lower East Side, <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>that</b> {{was at the time}} expanding with European immigration. It was the first public hospital in the United States to create a tuberculosis clinic, and the first to employ a female ambulance surgeon, Dr. Emily Dunning Barringer. When the hospital opened in 1885, its sole intent was to treat accident cases. Any patient needing to stay overnight was sent to nearby Bellevue Hospital. This soon changed – about two years after opening, the hospital had 40 beds in use. An 1894 article in the New York Times stated that Gouverneur did not have the resources or the space to properly serve the growing community.|$|E

25|$|A low {{socioeconomic}} status in a deprived neighborhood may include exposure to “environmental stressors and risk factors.” Socioeconomic inequalities are commonly {{measured by the}} Cartairs-Morris score, Index of Multiple Deprivation, Townsend deprivation index, and the Jarman score. The Jarman score, for example, considers “unemployment, overcrowding, single parents, under-fives, elderly living alone, ethnicity, low social class and residential mobility.” In Vos’ meta-analysis these indices are used to view the effect of low SES neighborhoods on maternal health. In the meta-analysis, data from individual studies were collected from 1985 up until 2008. Vos concludes that a correlation exists between prenatal adversities and deprived neighborhoods. Other {{studies have shown that}} low SES is closely associated with the development of the fetus in utero and growth retardation. Studies also suggest that children born in low SES families are “likely to be born prematurely, at low birth weight, or with asphyxia, a birth defect, a disability, fetal alcohol syndrome, or AIDS.” Bradley and Corwyn also suggest that congenital disorders arise from the mother’s lack of nutrition, a poor lifestyle, maternal substance abuse and “living in <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>that</b> contains hazards affecting fetal development (toxic waste dumps).” In a meta-analysis that viewed how inequalities influenced maternal health, it was suggested that deprived neighborhoods often promoted behaviors such as smoking, drug and alcohol use. After controlling for socioeconomic factors and ethnicity, several individual studies demonstrated an association with outcomes such as perinatal mortality and preterm birth.|$|E

500|$|In Manhattan, a [...] "cup handle" [...] branch, {{also known}} as the Lower East Side Loop or Route 103-B, of the IND Sixth Avenue Line would diverge east of the Second Avenue station under Houston Street, turn north under Avenue C with an {{intermediate}} stop at Eighth Street, turn west at 14th Street, and merge with the BMT 14th Street–Canarsie Line to Eighth Avenue. This branch would have served Alphabet City, <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>that</b> was underserved by public transit. This [...] "Avenue C Cuphandle" [...] was proposed because many of the Alphabet City's residents were working-class poor, and the SAS would not come close enough to serve the residents of Alphabet City. This route was approved by the Board of Estimate on March 19, 1970.|$|E
500|$|When Fischer was 16, {{his mother}} {{moved out of}} their {{apartment}} to pursue medical training. Her friend Joan Rodker, who had met Regina when the two were [...] "idealistic communists" [...] living in Moscow in the 1930s, believes that Fischer resented his mother for being mostly absent as a mother, a communist activist and an admirer of the Soviet Union and that this led to his hatred for the Soviet Union. In letters to Rodker, Fischer's mother states her desire to pursue her own [...] "obsession" [...] of training in medicine and writes that her son would {{have to live in}} their Brooklyn apartment without her: [...] "It sounds terrible to leave a 16-year-old to his own devices, but he is probably happier that way". The apartment was on the edge of Bedford-Stuyvesant, <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>that</b> had one of the highest homicide and general crime rates in New York City. Despite the alienation from her son, Regina, in 1960, protested the practices of the American Chess Foundation and staged a five-hour protest in front of the White House, urging President Dwight D. Eisenhower to send an American team to that year's chess Olympiad (set for Leipzig, East Germany, behind the Iron Curtain) and to help support the team financially.|$|E

2500|$|Navy's {{doctoral}} thesis, [...] "Nonparacompactness in Para-Lindelöf Spaces", {{was important}} {{in the development of}} metrizability theory. The paper examines the properties of para-Lindelöf topological spaces, which are a generalization of both Lindelöf spaces and paracompact spaces. In a para-Lindelöf space, every open cover has a locally countable open refinement, that is, one such that each point of the space has <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>that</b> intersects only countably many elements of the refinement. The spaces constructed by Navy are counterexamples to the conjecture that all para-Lindelöf spaces are paracompact. Some of her spaces are even normal Moore spaces under suitable set-theoretic assumptions. Since every metrizable space is paracompact, these are counterexamples to the normal Moore space conjecture.|$|E

Following his tour of the Archdiocese, O'Brien lamented the large presence of poverty and violence in Baltimore, saying, [...] "I think anybody who wants to take a walk can find areas with very nice homes, well-kept lawns, good streets and sidewalks, and maybe 15 minutes later find themselves in <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>that</b> is just racked, torn apart, as if a war had just been fought." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{has often}} been the pattern in Manhattan, <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>that</b> is [...] "discovered" [...] by artists and bohemians and then becomes [...] "hip" [...] will often begin to attract more {{affluent}} residents, which drives {{up the price of}} housing, and begins to drive out the residents who [...] "turned over" [...] the neighborhood. This is one theory of gentrification, and some argue that it has also occurred in the New York City neighborhoods SoHo and Tribeca in Manhattan, as well as Williamsburg in Brooklyn. Over the course of time, this demographic shift begins to change the essential character of the neighborhood: it becomes safer, more comfortable, less tolerant of noise, and less [...] "edgy".
