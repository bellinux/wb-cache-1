25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me <b>and</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E

2500|$|According to the BBC, at one time, Heaney's books made up {{two-thirds of}} the sales of living poets in the UK. His work often deals with the local {{surroundings}} of Ireland, particularly in Northern Ireland, {{where he was born}} and lived until young adulthood. Speaking of his early life and education, he commented, [...] "I learned that my local County Derry experience, which I had considered archaic and irrelevant to 'the modern world', was to be trusted. They taught me that trust <b>and</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> to articulate it."

In a 2011 interview, she gave credit to her coaches for noticing her aptness for skating, stating, [...] "My coaches have told me my muscles and body structure are perfect for skating. I was born with a good instrument, maybe more so than the talent. I was lucky my coaches noticed early on <b>and</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> develop that.

Bjelland commented on the event, saying: “I don’t know how I’ve progressed musically as such but a major influence in my writing was dealing with my whole schizophrenia episode. I actually haven’t spoken to anyone much about this. Dealing with multiple personalities was extremely difficult because some days I didn't know who I was or where I was at. I was very lucky that Adrian stuck by <b>and</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> through it all. So obviously {{that was going to}} affect some of what I wrote about."

2500|$|Javed Akhtar narrates: [...] "Kamal sahab {{gave me a}} job <b>and</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me.</b> My {{salary was}} Rs.50 {{and even in the}} 60s, you could not rent a house with that amount of money. I used to sleep {{in a corner of the}} studio. I started living in the costume room of the studio. I didn't have enough money to even go out to have a meal. In the evenings I would just potter around in the drawers. There were many {{cupboards}} filled with costumes of Pakeezah; sherwanis, dresses, shoes. One day I opened a drawer and found amid the clutter, three Filmfare trophies. I dusted them and realized they were Meena Kumari's Filmfare trophies. I had never held a trophy and a Filmfare trophy was akin to the Oscar in India. There were big mirrors in the room. In the evenings I would come back and lock myself in the costume room and hold the trophies in front of the mirror, acting how I would accept it if I were to receive it. The first trophy I held in my hand was that of Meena Kumari! I was an eighteen-year-old boy who had no home, no money, no food, but these trophies encouraged me to achieve my dreams, and for this, I will be always thankful to Meena-ji." ...|$|E
