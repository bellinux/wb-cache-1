5|$|Brolgas are gregarious creatures; {{the basic}} social unit {{is a pair}} or small family group of <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> birds, usually parents {{together}} with juvenile offspring, though some of such groups are unrelated. In the non-breeding season, they gather into large flocks, which appear to be many self-contained individual groups rather than a single social unit. Within the flock, families tend to remain separate and to coordinate their activities with one another rather than with the flock as a whole.|$|E
5|$|It {{was assumed}} {{at first that}} the lake existed in a single long {{interval}} between 1000-1500; however, later a succession of wet and dry phases was determined from radiocarbon dating. Each phase was stable for prolonged times. <b>About</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> highstands were identified in the lake, one theory assumes four highstands between 695-1580. One chronology assumes these highstands occurred 100 BC - 600 AD, 900-1250 and 1300-1500. Six or five different cycles are documented in Coachella. At Superstition Mountain five lake cycles from 817-964, 1290-1330, 1440-1640, 1480-1660, 1638-1689 and 1675-1687 are documented; the 1440-1640 cycle may have consisted of four sub-cycles that occurred within short time distances from each other. An older highstand was observed at East Mesa and dated to 3,850 years before present. At least 12 different cycles of lake growth and lake shrinkage occurred over the last 2,000 - 3,000 years. Radiocarbon dates of the highstands range 300 ± 100 to 1,580 ± 200 before present. The basin was probably not entirely dry between the last three highstands. The Colorado River Delta shows evidence of reduced sedimentation while the river drained into Lake Cahuilla.|$|E
5|$|The skins or {{heads of}} taiko are {{generally}} made from cowhide from Holstein cows aged <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> years. Skins also come from horses, and bull skin is preferred for larger drums. Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins {{are used for}} larger ones. On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance. Before fitting it to the drum body the hair {{is removed from the}} hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal. To stretch the skin over the drum properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several hydraulic jacks underneath it. The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead. Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden dowels or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension. Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes. Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin has dried, tacks, called byō, are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; chū-daiko require about 300 of them for each side. After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.|$|E

25|$|Caffeine is {{a central}} nervous system {{stimulant}} that reduces fatigue and drowsiness. At normal doses, caffeine has variable effects on learning and memory, but it generally improves reaction time, wakefulness, concentration, and motor coordination. The amount of caffeine needed to produce these effects varies from person to person, depending on body size and degree of tolerance. The desired effects arise approximately one hour after consumption, and the desired effects of a moderate dose usually subside after <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> hours.|$|E

25|$|The nobility, {{including}} the upper {{levels of the}} clergy, who were closely connected with them by family ties, numbered only <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> percent of the population; their number was estimated by modern historians at about twenty thousand men, women and children.

Below them were about a hundred families with incomes between 10,000 and 50,000 livres a year, including many high-ranking military men, magistrates, and financiers. The old nobility received their income from their estates, while newer nobles depended upon payments they received from the royal government in Versailles for various government positions and titles they held.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{during the}} nineteenth {{and most of the}} twentieth century, new plesiosaurs were {{described}} at a rate of three or four genera each decade, the pace suddenly picked up in the 1990s, with seventeen plesiosaurs being discovered in this period. The tempo of discovery accelerated in the early twenty-first century, with <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> plesiosaurs being named each year. This implies that about half of the known plesiosaurs are relatively new to science, a result of a far more intense field research. Some of this is taking place away from the traditional areas, e.g. in new sites developed in New Zealand, Argentina, Norway, Japan, China and Morocco, but the locations of the more original discoveries have proven to be still productive, with important new finds in England and Germany. Some of the new genera are a renaming of already known species, which were deemed sufficiently different to warrant a separate genus name.|$|E

500|$|On 13 August, after {{sighting}} a small patrol boat, three abandoned merchant {{ships were}} passed, {{some of them}} close by with boats showing flares. The convoy was sighted early in the morning, with the destroyer leading the tanker in astern of the line. The destroyer then informed the Convoy Commander of the tanker's condition. Torpedo planes flew in to distract attention from Junkers 88s which were coming in from a height. The convoy had detected these by R.D.F but could not sight them and the escorts were slow in opening fire on them. [...] was hit, probably by <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> bombs, and blew up with a tremendous explosion leaving [...] "a great pylon of flame on the sea". Ashanti signalled Ledbury to pick up survivors. The destroyer went to the scene, but it was originally thought impossible that anyone could survive such a terrific explosion and mass of flames, but on approaching, men were seen in the water. The destroyer entered the inferno, and after manoeuvring around the debris field the destroyer picked up forty-four survivors, and one body was buried that evening with military honours. Some time later {{it was discovered that}} Ledbury had on board survivors from both Waimarama and Melbourne Star. This happened because when Waimarama blew up it happened so suddenly that Melbourne Star passed right through the flames. Those aft on board Melbourne Star thought that their own ship had gone up and had jumped over the side. By half past-nine Ledbury had completed the recovery of survivors. By this time the Commander estimated that the destroyer was about thirty miles astern of the convoy, which meant that they had to speed up in order to reach the ships. Captain Hill then sent a message to Admiral Burrough, 'Interrogative STOP rejoin or go home'. When the signal rating brought in Burrough's reply it became apparent that the signal groups had been received corruptly, since the admiral was apparently ordering Ledbury to [...] "proceed to the Orkney and Shetland Islands". After considering the signal, Captain Hill assumed that it plainly intended the destroyer to return to Gibraltar, however that he might be forgiven for not interpreting it correctly, and so Ledbury ignored the signal and set course for Ohio.|$|E
