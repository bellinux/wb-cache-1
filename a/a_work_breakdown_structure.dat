The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to conduct a risk assessment and analysis for the M 109 l 55 mm Self Propelled Howitzer (SPH) Fleet Management Pilot Program.

50|$|The {{first step}} is to define the work.

In either case, {{it is important that the}} WBS or list be comprehensive.

50|$|Before {{a project}} {{schedule}} can be created, the schedule maker should have <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> (WBS), an effort estimate for each task, and a resource list with availability for each resource.

50|$|If the <b>work</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> {{designer}} {{attempts to}} capture any action-oriented {{details in the}} WBS, the designer will likely include either too many actions or too few actions. Too many actions will exceed 100% of the parent's scope and too few will fall short of 100% of the parent's scope. The best way {{to adhere to the}} 100% rule is to define WBS elements in terms of outcomes or results, not actions. This also ensures that the WBS is not overly prescriptive of methods, allowing for greater ingenuity and creative thinking {{on the part of the}} project participants. For new product development projects, the most common technique to ensure an outcome-oriented WBS is to use a product <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure.</b> Feature-driven software projects may use a similar technique which is to employ a feature <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure.</b> When a project provides professional services, a common technique is to capture all planned deliverables to create <b>a</b> deliverable-oriented WBS. <b>Work</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structures</b> that subdivide <b>work</b> by project phases (e.g. preliminary design phase, critical design phase) must ensure that phases are clearly separated by a deliverable also used in defining entry and exit criteria (e.g. an approved preliminary or critical design review).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the importance of}} the actions to be taken before the project planning phases begin. The approach taken stems from the production planning paradigm, with emphasis on the product, rather than on the process. It is argued that a complete part list or product <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> (PBS) is the absolute prerequisite for the design of <b>a</b> successful <b>work</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> (WBS) for <b>a</b> project. This process requires the definition of the design and configuration disciplines during the engineering phase. These critical issues of concurrent engineering and product development are also emphasized in the paper. The WBS is, in turn, needed to establish a suitable organizational <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> (OBS or organigram) for the project. Finally, the assembly sequence and the related assembly <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> (ABS) of the end product is required before commencing the project planning phase, which provides the schedules, resource allocation, progress control, and the like for the project management. Detailed definition of the product enables the definition of the work packages within the WBS, which combined with the installation information provide the means to structure the layout for the project organization. The result of the entire process, that begins with the product definition phase and ends with the completion of the planning phase, is called the project management plan. The procedure described in the paper will be used to design the project management plan for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a ten-year "ordeal" commencing {{at the beginning of the}} 1995, at CER...|$|R
40|$|Many shipyards today {{contract}} vessels {{based on}} the traditional Lump Sum Fixed Price (LSFP) contract. Even though the construction of vessels from contract to delivery lasts from a year to longer, there are limited mechanisms available to mitigate for risk during the project evolution, {{especially in the case}} of prototype vessels, which are being built by the shipyard for the first time and include much uncertainty with regards to project drawings, detailed material lists and man-hours. Shipbuilding is definitely a large engineering construction project (LECP). Therefore it is logical to analyse how LECPs are contracted and managed in other industries which successfully minimize contract risk and constantly ensure profit in its business. In this paper two new shipbuilding-contracting models are presented and applied in a generic case study of contracting the newbuilding of a prototype vessel. The Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) and the Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract models are demonstrated as improving the contracting process while yielding positive results for production, both in relation to the core capabilities of the shipyard as well as the sub-contracted activities in vessel production. Likewise <b>a</b> product <b>work</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> PWBS is shown as the model for shipyard business that very well complements the advanced contracting models.
