2500|$|After the 2012 Summer Olympics Campaign, Liz {{was due to}} {{head back}} to the United States to {{complete}} her season with Tulsa Shock in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), but announced on the morning her flight was due to leave, 27 August 2012, that she would not be returning to the States to finish the 2012 season with Tulsa Shock. Her agent released a statement saying [...] "Over the past 6 months Liz has been involved with the Australian National Team as they prepared for the 2012 London Olympics. She has returned from the Olympic campaign physically exhausted and is in need of some recovery time. Unfortunately this will make her unavailable for the remaining few weeks of the WNBA season. We are aware that this is an unfortunate situation <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>appreciate</b> and thank Tulsa Shock for their understanding." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{have not}} {{mentioned}} Shakespeare, because his works come {{under a different}} category. Though they mark the very highest level of human genius, they yet represent no special epoch {{in the history of}} the individual mind. The man of Shakespeare is always the man of actual life as he is acted upon by the worlds of sense and of spirit under certain definite conditions. We all of us may be in the position of Macbeth or Othello or Hamlet, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>appreciate</b> their sayings and deeds potentially, so to speak, rather than actually, through the sympathy of our common nature and not of our experience. But with the four books I have mentioned our relation is a very different one. We all of us grow up through the Homeric period of the senses; we all feel, at some time, sooner or later, the need of something higher, and, like Dante, shape our theory of the divine government of the universe; we all with Cervantes discover the rude contrast between the ideal and real, and with Goethe the unattainableness of the highest good through the intellect alone. Therefore I set these books by themselves. I do not mean that we read them, or for their full enjoyment need to read them, in this light; but I believe that this fact of their universal and perennial application to our consciousness and our experience accounts for their permanence, and insures their immortality.|$|E

40|$|In otorhinolaryngologist's {{experience}} the nasal out-breath of people affected by chronic nasal or paranasal infections may {{be characterized by}} peculiar odours. In a previous study we showed that an electronic nose (EN), examining nasal out breath was able to distinguish subjects affected by chronic rhinosinusitis from healthy subjects. The present study is aimed at analysing the intensity {{and the quality of}} the odorous components present in the air expired by patients affected by rhinosinusitis, using a new EN based on gas-chromatography and surface acoustic wave analysis. In the gas-chromatographic tracings of the pathologic subjects there were six peaks, which were not present in control group cases. These peaks correspond to odorous components, whose chemical composition ranges from C 6 to C 14. Peaks obtained were compaired with other tracings revealed from specific bacterial and fungal cultures analyses <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>appreciated</b> some analogies...|$|R
