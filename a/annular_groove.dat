25|$|A {{lockbolt}} is {{a fastener}} {{similar to a}} bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to a nut using a turning motion, a lockbolt has <b>annular</b> <b>grooves</b> around the shaft of the bolt (pin). After placing the lockbolt in a hole, a threadless collar is forced at high pressures around the <b>annular</b> <b>grooves,</b> deforming the collar and permanently locking it into place around the grooves. Swaging is the generic term for setting a lockbolt and collar assembly. During the installation cycle of a lockbolt, the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into the grooves of the harder pin. As the force required for swaging increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off.|$|R

A clinical study was planned to evaluate the effects of different anterior points of reference and two different articulator systems on condylar guidance. Materials and Methods: Total 15 subjects were selected. Six sets of maxillary casts were obtained.

The emergence of spiral gravitational instabilities (GI) is predicted via a generalized eigenvalue code that performs a linear analysis, and confirmed with hydrodynamical simulations. We find the presence of a groove drives a fast-growing two-armed mode in moderately massive disks, and extends the importance of self-gravitating instabilities down to lower disk masses than for which they would otherwise occur.

A unique water test facility is used to acquire leakage resistance measurements for two-dimensional, planar models of multi-cavity, stepped seal geometries. The test-section includes a series of 100 : I scale, acrylic models of actual rotor and stator elements. Adjustable external controls allow individual positioning of the seal elements to the desired radial and axial position. Flow-visualization techniques are also used to assist in identification and understanding of the turbulence generating flow patterns which promote improved leakage resistance. Seal geometries are examined over a range of flow Reynolds numbers, and axial rotor positions, for fixed restrictor clearance and stator step height values. Four separate flow path regions of interest, within the seal cavity, are identified. Each region of interest is comprised of a series of acrylic components which can be interchanged to construct a wide range of advanced seal geometries. The effects of isolated, geometric alterations in each region of interest are investigated and used in conjunction with flow-visuahzation studies to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} labyrinth flow field and seal performance. Additionally, complicated coupling mechanisms goveming the relationship between seal leakage resistance and seal geometry are identified and the influence of axial distance-tocontact is addressed. Experimental results imply that leakage resistance can be improved through the development of opposing flow recirculation zones in the upsmm portion of the seal cavity. Also, contoured surfaces and restrictor leading-edge extensions of proper dimensions can be introduced in the seal cavity to reduce ovemu seal leakage. Addition of <b>annular</b> <b>grooves</b> to the geometries provided no improvement in leakage resistance, and in some instances proved detrimental to seal performance.
