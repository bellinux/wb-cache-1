5|$|Alan Eagleson was not repentant for his <b>actions</b> during game eight.

5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and <b>actions</b> took place before that date. These <b>actions,</b> often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early <b>actions</b> have been credited with preparing the gay community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} statistic {{tracked by}} {{the game is}} Karma which {{is affected by the}} decisions and <b>actions</b> the character performs during the game. Positive <b>actions</b> to Karma include freeing captives and helping others, while negative <b>actions</b> towards this include killing good characters and stealing. <b>Actions</b> vary in the level of karma change they cause; thus, pickpocketing produces less negative karma than the killing of a good character. Karma can have tangible effects to the player, beyond acting as flavor for the game's events, in that it can affect the ending the player gets, alter dialogue with non-player characters (NPCs) or give off unique reactions from other characters, while also granting access to certain perks that require a specific Karma level. However, the player's relationships with the game's factions are distinct, so any two groups or settlements may view the player in contrasting ways, depending on the player's conduct.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{is almost}} {{identical}} to the previous game's version of the series' Active Time Battle (ATB) system, called the Command Synergy Battle system. Under this system, the player selects an action from the menus, such as Attack, Abilities, or Item. Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills at a constant rate to a set maximum number of slots. The kinds of attack <b>actions</b> available are close-range melee attacks or ranged magical attacks, {{but there are also}} other magical <b>actions</b> that evoke healing or shielding abilities. The ATB bar can be increased in size throughout the game from three slots to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible <b>actions</b> or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many <b>actions</b> as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with <b>actions</b> chosen automatically. <b>Actions</b> cannot be performed outside of combat, and the characters' health is fully restored after each fight. Players have the option of restarting a battle while {{in the middle of a}} fight. During some skirmishes, players are put through quick time events called Cinematic <b>Actions</b> that allows them to deal higher damage to foes and end certain battles.|$|E

It includes martial arts <b>action,</b> extreme sports <b>action,</b> car chases and vehicles, suspense <b>action,</b> and <b>action</b> comedy, with each focusing in more detail on its own type and flavour of <b>action.</b> It is usually possible to tell from the creative style of an <b>action</b> sequence, the emphasis of an entire work, so that, for example, the style of a combat sequence will indicate whether the entire work can be classified as <b>action</b> adventure, or a martial work. <b>Action</b> is mainly defined by a central focus on any kind of exciting movement.|$|R

5|$|In another Buddhist text Majjhima Nikāya, the Buddha criticizes Jain {{emphasis}} on the destruction of unobservable and unverifiable types of karma {{as a means to}} end suffering, rather than on eliminating evil mental states such as greed, hatred and delusion, which are observable and verifiable. In the Upālisutta dialogue of this Majjhima Nikāya text, Buddha contends with a Jain monk who asserts that bodily <b>actions</b> are the most criminal, in comparison to the <b>actions</b> of speech and mind. Buddha criticises this view, saying that the <b>actions</b> of mind are most criminal, and not the <b>actions</b> of speech or body. Buddha also criticises the Jain ascetic practice of various austerities, claiming that he, Buddha, is happier when not practising the austerities.|$|E
5|$|Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd list {{four main}} methods of {{creating}} machinima.
