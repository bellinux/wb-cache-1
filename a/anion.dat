40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{anomalous}} <b>anions</b> (e. g., NO 3, SCN) potentiate the twitch, the potassium contracture (K-contracture) and the caffeine contracture in skeletal muscles of the frog. However, some problems concerning the sites of action of anomalous <b>anions</b> and the mechanism of potentiation of various contractions by these <b>anions</b> have not yet been satisfactorilly clarified. In this review, we have summarized the present available knowledge including our results and considerations regarding the sites of action of anomalous <b>anions</b> and the mechanism of potentiation of twitch, K-contracture and caffeine contracture by these <b>anions</b> and have obtained the following conclusions. Descriptions are confined to twitch muscle fibers of the frog, since there is no avilable data on slow muslce fibers of the frog. 1. The potentiation of twitch, K-contracture and caffeine contracture by anomalous <b>anions</b> is caused mainly by the direct action of these <b>anions</b> on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in twitch muscle fibers. The <b>anions</b> enter mainly through the membrane of the transverse tubules. 2. The potentiation of twitch by anomalous <b>anions</b> is ascribed to the prolongation of the duration of the active state, which is due to the increased Ca release from SR and/or the delayed Ca reaccumulalion by SR caused by these <b>anions.</b> 3. The mechanism of the potentiation of K-contracture and caffeine contracture by anomalous <b>anions</b> is due to the enhancement of the intensity of the active state by these <b>anions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Photostimulated {{electron}} {{detachment from}} aqueous inorganic <b>anions</b> is the simplest example of solvent-mediated electron transfer. Here we contrast {{the behavior of}} halide <b>anions</b> with that of small polyatomic <b>anions,</b> such as pseudohalide <b>anions</b> (e. g., HS-) and common polyvalent <b>anions</b> (e. g., SO 32 -). Geminate recombination dynamics of hydrated electrons generated by 200 nm photoexcitation of aqueous <b>anions</b> (I-, Br-, OH-, HS-, CNS-, CO 32 -, SO 32 -, and Fe(CN) 64 -) have been studied. Prompt quantum yields {{for the formation of}} solvated, thermalized electrons and quantum yields for free electrons were determined. Pump-probe kinetics for 200 nm photoexcitation were compared with kinetics obtained at lower photoexcitation energy (225 nm or 242 nm) for the same <b>anions,</b> where possible. Free diffusion and mean force potential models of geminate recombination dynamics were used to analyze these kinetics. These analyses suggest that for polyatomic <b>anions</b> (including all polyvalent <b>anions</b> studied) the initial electron distribution has a broad component, even at relatively low photoexcitation energy. There seem to be no well-defined threshold energy below which the broadening of the distribution does not occur, as is the case for halide <b>anions.</b> Direct ionization to the conduction band of water is the most likely photoprocess broadening the electron distribution. Our study suggests that halide <b>anions</b> are in the class of their own; electron photodetachment from polyatomic, especially polyvalent, <b>anions</b> follows a different set of rules.

40|$|A new coated {{capillary}} {{has been}} introduced for capillary electrophoretic separation of <b>anions</b> by using a positively charged diazacrown ether with a 12 -membered ring. A positive charge spread over the inner capillary surface led to a substantial anodic electroosmotic flow (EOF) over the range of migrating buffer of pH 2 - 11. Under the optimum conditions of 25 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7, the diazacrown-coated capillary showed a successful simultaneous separation of 7 inorganic <b>anions</b> and 13 aromatic <b>anions</b> (including positional isomers) in less than 15 min. The migration times of the sample <b>anions</b> and EOF marker for consecutive runs on a single column were highly reproducible, giving a relative standard deviation of 1 %. Theoretical treatment of the migration behavior clearly demonstrated that ion association between the diazacrown and analyte <b>anions</b> {{is strongly dependent on}} the nature of the functional groups of <b>anions</b> (e. g., sulfonate groups > carboxyl groups) and the number of negative charges (e. g., trivalent <b>anions</b> > divalent <b>anions</b> > monovalent <b>anions)</b> on the analyte...|$|R
30|$|The Chadha diagram (Chadha 1999) {{was used}} to define the major water types in the areas. It is a {{modified}} version of the Piper (1944) diagram and plots the difference in milliequivalent percentage between alkaline earths (Ca + Mg) and alkali metals (Na + K) expressed as percentage and plotted on the x-axis. The difference in milliequivalent percentage between weak acidic <b>anions</b> (CO 3  + HCO 3) and strong acidic <b>anions</b> (Cl + SO 4) is plotted on the y-axis. The rectangular field resulting from this is similar to the diamond-shaped field in the Piper diagram and describes the overall character of the water. Thus, there are eight fields in the rectangular plot which represent eight different water types as in the case of Piper diagram. Those eight water types are: (1) alkaline earths exceed alkali metals; (2) alkali metals exceed alkaline earths; (3) weak acidic <b>anions</b> exceed strong acidic anions; (4) strong acidic <b>anions</b> exceed weak acidic anions; (5) alkaline earths and weak acidic <b>anions</b> exceed both alkali metals and strong acidic <b>anions,</b> respectively (such water has temporary hardness); (6) alkaline earths exceed alkali metals and strong acidic <b>anions</b> exceed weak acidic <b>anions</b> (such water has permanent hardness); (7) alkali metals exceed alkaline earths and strong acidic <b>anions</b> exceed weak acidic anions; (8) alkali metals exceed alkaline earths and weak acidic <b>anions</b> exceed strong acidic <b>anions</b> (Chadha 1999).|$|R

A bench-scale spiral wound configuration of sulphonated polysulphone low pressure reverse osmosis membrane (LPROM) was used to remove heavy metals at various operating conditions, i. e. operating conditions, solute concentrations and temperature. The results show that the higher the operating pressure the greater will be the permeate flux for heavy metals from both mono- and divalent <b>anions.</b> At low operating pressure however, metals from the divalent <b>anions</b> give a higher permeate flux than did the monovalent <b>anions.</b> Permeate flux in both mono- and divalent <b>anions</b> is shown to be subsequently increased by a decrease of the concentration of feed solution.

Evalua-tion of nucleation mode of zinc {{in the presence}} and absence of oxalate <b>anions</b> showed that the instantaneous nucleation is predomi-nant in both cases. From the AFM images, the nuclei densities for zinc deposition were 3. 5 109 and 2 109 cm 2 in the absence and presence of oxalate <b>anions,</b> respectively.

However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including poisoning from methanol, salicylates, iron, isoniazid, paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as uremia or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning. Finally, many commercial radiator antifreeze products have fluorescein added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine which can help to diagnose poisoning.|$|E
