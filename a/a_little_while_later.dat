When the Governor of Marie-Galante, which the British had just occupied a month earlier, informed him that Goree was engaged, Captain William Robillard immediately came to Gorees assistance.

After being cured by Slughorn, he then consumes poisoned mead (which Draco Malfoy actually intended for Dumbledore).

While sitting by his bed, Hermione, Harry, Ginny and the twins hear Ron mutter Hermione's name in his delirium, although they do not hear {{what he is saying}} and ignore it. Conversely, Ron feigns sleep when Lavender visits him. Upon recovering, Ron and Hermione reconcile, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>later,</b> Ron and Lavender break up. Rowling in an interview said that she [...] "really enjoyed writing the Ron/Lavender business, and the reason that was enjoyable was Ron up to this point has been quite immature compared to the other two, and he kind of needed to make himself worthy of Hermione....he had to grow up emotionally and now he's taken a big step up." ...|$|E
2500|$|The CIA welcomed Fidel Castro on {{his visit}} to DC, {{and gave him a}} face to face briefing. [...] The CIA hoped that Castro would bring about a {{friendly}} democratic government, and planned to curry his favor with money and guns. [...] On December 11, 1959, a memo reached the DI's desk recommending Castro's [...] "elimination". [...] Dulles replaced the word [...] "elimination" [...] with [...] "removal", and set the wheels in motion. [...] By mid August 1960, Dick Bissell sought, with the blessing of the CIA, to hire the Mafia to assassinate Castro. [...] At the same time, his men were working on a parallel plan, recruiting a Cuban exile to assassinate him. [...] <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>later,</b> the FBI advised the CIA that {{it would be impossible to}} overthrow Castro with these chatty Cuban exiles.

2500|$|In late November, the brigade, {{under the}} command of Brigadier Ivan Dougherty who had {{replaced}} Potts in controversial circumstances following the withdrawal from Kokoda, was committed to the fighting around Gona. The 2/14th Battalion, consisting of only 350 men, arrived at Popondetta in the evening of 25 November and began the advance towards Gona at dawn the following day. [...] They were followed shortly afterwards by the 2/27th, while the 2/16th arrived <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>later,</b> after the two battalions had launched an attack around Basabua on 29 November. Further engagements followed on 30 November when clearing operations were undertaken between Basabua and Gona and on 1 December the brigade, operating as a composite battalion due to heavy casualties, attacked Gona itself. They were able to enter the village and remained {{for a short period of}} time before being forced out by a Japanese counterattack. Another unsuccessful attack was launched on 6 December. On 8 December, however, supported by a heavy artillery barrage, the 21st Brigade attacked the village from the west while the 39th Battalion attacked from the south-east. This time the attack was successful and Gona was captured with the last Japanese resistance being overcome the following afternoon amidst fierce hand-to-hand fighting. The brigade had suffered heavily over the previous 11 days, with 750 Australians being killed or wounded.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1803-1804, a group of Federalist congressmen plotted to {{establish}} a [...] "Northern Confederacy" [...] consisting of New Jersey, New York, New England, and Canada, to be established {{with the support of}} Britain, John Adams, [...] and Alexander Hamilton. When traction was not found with the Adams and Hamilton the conspirators turned to Vice President Aaron Burr. With Burr on trial for Burr Conspiracy they would loose the support of New York, New Jersey, and Maryland. In Massachusetts the scheme started in Ipswich but quickly moved to Salem by the Essex Junto headed by Timothy Pickering who had served for Washington and Adams as Secretary of State. Along with Daniel Webster, George Cabot, William Prescott Jr., [...] and Nathan Dane Pickering made loud threats that were noticed by Samuel Adams, [...] Thomas Jefferson, and Joseph Story in their various letters. During the War of 1812 Massachusetts pulled all military and financial support from the war and built their own standing forces with the threat of siding with the British who already took over what was then territory of Massachusetts, Maine. In Salem they re-outfitted the old hill fort and rename it Fort Pickering in preparation for the defense of the British once they ventured south of Maine. Webster, Pickering, Prescott, and Cabot headed south to Hartford Connecticut for a convention with threats of secession. The Hartford Convention ended up to be a comedy of errors for in Ghent the treaty was signed that ended the War. Also by the time they arrived in Washington D.C. news had arrived that Jackson and Lafitte had defeated Wellington's army in New Orleans. This could have been a serious wound to the new country, but President Monroe did a tour of New England in 1817 to heal the wounds of the Hartford Convention as the Federalist Party dissolved, for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>later</b> reforming as the Whig Party, but for a short time Monroe succeeded in unifying the country into a one party system and removed the specter of the collapse of the country.|$|E

5000|$|In her memoirs written {{many years}} later, the suffragist Hannah Mitchell {{provides}} {{a number of}} glimpses of Hansen during the 1906-10 period. Mitchell remembers her campaigning during a by-election at Huddersfield in November; <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>later,</b> <b>while</b> leading <b>a</b> series of meetings, Mitchell caught a chill: [...] "I became so ill that my hostess, Mrs Coates-Hanson, put me to bed at once ... Thanks to her kindness I managed to get through all the meetings, and she insisted on my staying {{a few days to}} rest. The Hanson home was lovely, {{and it was the first}} time in my life I had ever been waited on, and nursed, while the beautiful courtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Hanson to each other, and to their guests, made those few days like a glimpse of Paradise".|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>later,</b> <b>while</b> Bert was {{off on a}} fresh diatribe, Billy {{became aware}} that he was making comparisons. This house was not like his house. Here was no {{satisfying}} atmosphere. Things seemed to run with a jar. He recollected that when they arrived the breakfast dishes had not yet been washed. With a man's general obliviousness of household affairs, he had not noted details; yet it had been borne in on him, all morning, in a myriad ways, that Mary was not the housekeeper Saxon was. He glanced proudly across at her, and felt the spur of an impulse to leave his seat, go around, and embrace her. She was a wife. He remembered her dainty undergarmenting, and on the instant, into his brain, leaped the image of her so appareled, only to be shattered by Bert.|$|R
50|$|Juliette is {{rushed to}} the hospital, where the doctor tells her {{that she has to}} cancel the tour immediately. Avery shows up at the hospital, but leaves when Noah comes in. Juliette, though, tracks him down and tells him if he wants to be the baby's father, he'll need to let her be a part of his life as well. Avery, though, tells Juliette that he will get to be the baby's father on his terms. Juliette later reveals her {{pregnancy}} to the media as why she's cancelling her tour, and admits that Avery is the father when a reporter asks. Around the one-year anniversary of her mother's death, Juliette has flashbacks of her childhood. At the CMA's Juliette meets Avery's parents; his mom adores her while his father doesn't. When walking back to her seat she overhears his dad saying that he doesn't think that she and Avery will make good parents and brings up her past. Avery vows that they won't be like their parents. Juliette tells him that they are having a girl. Weeks after the CMA's, Juliette asks Avery to move in with her after the baby is born just for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while.</b> Avery <b>later</b> asks Juliette to marry him, she says yes, and they have a judge marry them. After canceling her baby shower, Juliette's water breaks while arguing with Rayna. She is {{rushed to the}} hospital where she has her baby girl, Cadence. After having Cadence, Juliette is more focused on her career than the baby and neglects her. Emily is concerned and informs Avery.

5000|$|He was {{involved}} {{in the aftermath of the}} Paris disputation of 1240, and subsequent condemnation of the Talmud. After the disputation a tribunal was appointed to pass judgment upon the Talmud, among its members being Eudes de Chateauroux, Chancellor of the University of Paris; Guillaume d'Auvergne, Bishop of Paris; and the Inquisitor Henri de Cologne. After the same rabbis had been heard a second time, the Talmud was condemned to be burned. Two years after (in the middle of 1242) twenty-four cartloads of Hebrew books were solemnly burned at Paris. ... <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>later,</b> <b>while</b> at Lyons, the pope listened to the complaints of the Jews, and in 1247 he asked Eudes de Chateauroux to examine the Talmud from the Jewish standpoint, and to ascertain whether it might not be tolerated as harmless to the Christian faith, and whether the copies which had been confiscated might not be returned to their owners. The rabbis had represented to him that without the aid of the Talmud they could not understand the Bible or the rest of their statutes. Eudes informed the pope that the change of attitude involved in such a decision would be wrongly interpreted, and on 15 May 1248 the Talmud was condemned for the second time. [...] A long list of errors and blasphemies contained the Talmud was compiled by Eudes de Chateauroux, much in the same manner as philosophical errors would also be condemned. He was made cardinal-bishop of Frascati (1244). He is given also as bishop of Toulouse and bishop of Maguelonne and legate, and was sent to preach crusade in France by Pope Innocent IV. He accompanied Louis IX of France on the Seventh Crusade, and is mentioned by Joinville, returning in 1254, via Cyprus.
