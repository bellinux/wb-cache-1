Based on identified thermal bridges calculations were carried out with programs TEDI and TOST {{in accordance with the}} methodology specified in the <b>applicable</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis.</b> The significance of thermal bridges was shown with a comparison of calculations made with and without acknowledging the thermal bridges. Results have shown that thermal bridges can have an impact of 15, 4 % to 17, 4 % on the energy consumption in the present building. The thesis demonstrates the importance of connecting IR photos and calculations and presents practical options of using this method...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} {{calculated and}} measured energy certificates of a building, which were calculated and measured {{for the building}} of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geodesy in Ljubljana - the FGG building. The necessary calculations of the energy provided for functioning of the building were performed in accordance with the methodology specified in the <b>applicable</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis.</b> The thesis provides measures for improving the thermal envelope of the building and presents an example of monitoring the consumed energy in the building, which would enable the building's manager and its users consistent monitoring of the information on energy consumption. In combination with the suggestion on automatisation of heating and lighting, higher energy efficiency and consequently more rational use of energy could be achieved in the building...|$|E

Na podlagi identificiranih toplotnih mostov so bili izvedeni izračuni s programoma TEDI in TOST, ki temeljita na veljavni zakonski podlagi. Nato so bile izvedene primerjave izračunov z upoštevanjem in brez upoštevanja toplotnih mostov. Primerjave so pokazale, da imajo toplotni mostovi od 15, 4 % do 17, 4 % vpliva na porabo energije v obravnavani stavbi. Diplomsko delo dokazuje pomembno povezavo med IR posnetki in izračuni in navaja praktični možnosti uporabe te metodologije.

40|$|The {{choice of}} the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for a given measure can {{influence}} the procedure by which legislation is adopted, and thereby the scope and content of EU policy. The ambiguity surrounding the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental acts based in Articles 130 s and 100 a {{opened the way for}} a 'legal-basis game', where EU institutions chose the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> partly on the basis of political considerations. In the period 1987 - 93, the two most important legal bases for environmental acts (Articles 130 s and 100 a) were subject to very different procedures for adoption (unanimity and qualified majority voting, respectively). From 1993 onwards, both articles were subject to qualified majority voting. After a general discussion of the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> and its significance for policy, this paper examines the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental legislation during the period 1987 - 99. I conclude that, although the legal-basis game is played out with respect to certain acts, {{there is little evidence that}} it is a regular and systematic feature of the policy process in the EU. ...|$|R
