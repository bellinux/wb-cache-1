Rents were generally reduced and 50% or more of <b>outstanding</b> <b>arrears</b> were cancelled.

50|$|In April 1760, the Jamaican {{government}} {{called upon}} the maroons to honor their treaties {{and come to}} their assistance during the major slave uprising led by the Fante leader, Tacky. The Windward Maroons were first to be mobilized. Their intervention often appeared half-hearted: the Scott's Hall Maroons began by claiming <b>outstanding</b> <b>arrears</b> in bounty, while those of Down's Cove simply took cover when attacked by the rebels. In the end, it was a Scott's Hall Maroon, Lieutenant Davy, who killed Tacky during a skirmish. Although the loss of Tacky's leadership essentially ended the rebellion, by October, related uprisings broke out on the leeward side of the island. Cudjoe's well-trained forces were also mobilized to help deal with them, apparently to good effect.|$|R

50|$|His {{foreign policy}} {{was guided by}} a desire to reduce the nominal {{independence}} of the larger native states, and to avoid extending the political relations of his government with foreign powers outside India. Pressed to intervene in Hyderabad, he refused to do so, claiming on this occasion that interference was only justified if the administration of native princes tends unquestionably to the injury of the subjects or of the allies of the British government. He negotiated in 1853 a treaty with the nizam, which provided funds for the maintenance of the contingent kept up by the British in support of that princes' authority, by the assignment of the Berars in lieu of annual payments of the cost and large <b>outstanding</b> <b>arrears.</b> The Berar treaty, he told Sir Charles Wood, is more likely to keep the nizam on his throne than anything that has happened for 50 years to him, {{while at the same time}} the control thus acquired over a strip of territory intervening between Bombay and Nagpur promoted his policy of consolidation and his schemes of railway extension. The same spirit induced him to tolerate a war of succession in Bahawalpur, so long as the contending candidates did not violate British territory.|$|R
50|$|The Act {{applied to}} croft tenure {{in an area}} which is now {{recognisable}} as a definition of the Highlands and Islands: that of the ancient counties of Argyll, Inverness-shire, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland, Caithness, Orkney and Shetland. (The name is used now as a name for an electoral area of the Scottish Parliament: please see Highlands and Islands). The Act granted security of tenure of existing crofts and established the first Crofters Commission (The same name was given to a different body in 1955). The Crofters Commission had rent-fixing powers. Rents were generally reduced and 50% or more of <b>outstanding</b> <b>arrears</b> were cancelled. The Act failed however {{to address the issue}} of severely limited access to land, and crofters renewed their protest actions. At the same time there was a shift in the political climate: William Gladstone's Liberal government fell from power; the new Conservative government was much less sympathetic to the plight of crofters and much more willing to use troops to quell protests. The Liberal Party appeared to adopt and champion Land League objectives and, as a distinct parliamentary force, the Land League fragmented during the 1890s. On the issue of access to land, therefore, little real progress was to be made until after the First World War.|$|R

Preparing Gabon for the post-oil era requires strengthening {{the efficiency of the}} public sector and providing a framework for private sector development to raise the productivity of the Gabonese economy. In the public sector, improving expenditure management, especially of public investment, is essential.

Sectoral contributions to high growth included a rebound in the livestock sector from harsh winter shocks of 2000 – 01 and strong mining exploration and exports, boosted by a favorable environment of unusually high copper and gold prices. After several years of moderation, however, inflation has accelerated, reaching 17 Â½ percent through June 2005, as prices of fuels and meat have increased sharply in the past twelve months.

40|$|Thesis (M. Env. Dev.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2005. A common {{strategy}} {{in dealing with}} housing shortages is the provision of loans to low-income groups. Tried in many countries {{for a very long}} time, this approach has produced a common phenomenon - poor servicing of loans. Thus, an empirical study was undertaken in Namibia, using the country's Build Together Programme as a case study. The aim {{of the study was to}} understand how the livelihood circumstances of the beneficiaries might be contributing to their inability to meet their loan obligations. The BTP's beneficiaries and the housing officers at both local and national level constituted the study's respondents. Housing officers responded to questions in an interview schedule while the beneficiaries were engaged using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. All beneficiaries were purposefully identified on account of <b>outstanding</b> <b>arrears</b> on their loans. Reviewing of literature covered the challenge of urban housing and strategies used to address it at both global and national level, documentary analysis on government documents to provide information on establishment of BTP and lastly, the direct observation of the concerned sites. The study focused on BTP in Windhoek (WHK) particularly in two settlements, Katutura (a formal settlement) and Goreangab (an informal settlement). Poor servicing of loans was shown to be closely associated with the socio-economic circumstances of the beneficiaries. This suggests the importance to recognise that housing is not just about the physical structure called a house, but there are other more subtle but equally important considerations that need to be met. Issues such as reliance on wage labour and large household sizes combined in ways that placed limitations on their ability to service the loans. An important conclusion from the study is that understanding beneficiary' constraints and their livelihood strategies might be a very important step in future housing policy actions in Namibia. The study also highlighted concerns about the programme such as inadequate communication. Some recommendations are provided, prominent among them being the need to strengthen the training component so as to assist the beneficiaries with some of the issues, The study consists of two components: A and B. Component A comprises the study background, the problem statement, aim, objectives, literature review and methodology. Component B is presented as a research paper for publication purposes and complies with the requirements of the selected journal (Appendix six). For the purposes of the paper, relevant information from component A on the purpose of the study and methodology are incorporated in Component B...|$|R
