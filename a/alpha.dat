We have designed a G <b>alpha(s)</b> minigene that retains the signals required for G <b>alpha(s)</b> alternative splicing in vivo. Employing transient transfection of human myometrial smooth muscle cells and HeLa cells, {{as well as in}} vitro splicing assays, we have provided evidence that the antagonistic splicing factors SF 2 /ASF and hnRNPA 1 act as potent regulators of G <b>alpha(s)</b> isoform expression in these cells. Both SF 2 /ASF and hnRNPA 1 control the selection of competing 5 '-splice sites and respectively promote inclusion or skipping of the small cassette-type exon 3 of G <b>alpha(s)</b> transcripts, resulting in the generation of G <b>alpha(s)</b> -long and G <b>alpha(s)</b> -short mRNA isoforms. We have also provided evidence that SF 2 /ASF and hnRNPA 1 play a role in 3 '-splice site selection involving the use of a non-canonical TG 3 '-splice site preceding exon 4. Using a score-matrix analysis to identify putative exonic enhancer sequences (ESEs), we found multiple high score ESE motifs for SF 2 /ASF, SC 35, and SRp 40 in exon 3 of G <b>alpha(s).</b> These results suggest that tissue-specific expression of SF 2 /ASF and hnRNPA 1 governs the expression of alternative isoforms of G <b>alpha(s)</b> in these different cells types...|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms of}} interaction between G(s) and the A(2 A) adenosine receptor were investigated using synthetic peptides corresponding to various segments of the G <b>alpha(s)</b> carboxyl terminus. Synthetic peptides were tested {{for their ability to}} modulate binding of a selective radiolabeled agonist, [H- 3] 2 -[4 -(2 -carboxyethyl) phenylethylamino]- 5 '-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine ([H- 3]CGS 21680), to A(2 A) adenosine receptors in rat striatal membranes. The G <b>alpha(s)</b> peptides stimulated specific binding both in the presence and absence of 100 mu M guanosine- 5 '-O-(3 -thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S). Three peptides, G <b>alpha(s)</b> (378 - 394) C(379) A, G <b>alpha(s)</b> (376 - 394) C(379) A, and G <b>alpha(s)</b> (374 - 394) C(379) A, were the most effective. In the presence of GTP gamma S, peptide G <b>alpha(s)</b> (374 - 394) C(379) A increased specific binding in a dose-dependent fashion. However, the peptide did not stabilize the high-affinity state of the A(2 A) adenosine receptor for [H- 3] CGS 21680. Binding assays with a radiolabeled selective antagonist, [H- 3] 5 -amino- 7 -(2 -henylethyl) - 2 -(2 -furyl) pyrazolo[4, 3 -e]- 1, 2, 4 -triazolo[1, 5 -c]pyrimidine ([H- 3]SCH 58261), showed that the addition of the G <b>alpha(s)</b> peptide modified the slope of the 5 '-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) competition curve, suggesting modulation of receptor affinity states. In the presence of GTP gamma S, the displacement curve was right-shifted, whereas the addition of G <b>alpha(s)</b> (374 - 394) C(379) A caused a partial left-shift. Both curves were fitted by one-site models. This same G <b>alpha(s)</b> peptide was also able to disrupt G(s) -coupled signal transduction as indicated by inhibition of the A(2 A) receptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity without affecting either basal or forskolin-stimulated enzymatic activity in the same membrane preparations. Shorter peptides from G <b>alpha(s)</b> and G alpha(i 1 / 2) carboxyl termini were not effective. NMR spectroscopy showed the strong propensity of peptide G <b>alpha(s)</b> (374 - 394) C(379) A to assume a compact carboxyl-terminal alpha-helical conformation in solution. Overall, our results point out the conformation requirement of G <b>alpha(s)</b> carboxyl-terminal peptides to modulate agonist binding to rat A(2 A) adenosine receptors and disrupt signal transduction...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCaprine <b>alpha(s</b> 1) -casein {{polymorphism}} {{is one of}} the {{key factors}} which determines important technological properties of milk, such as rennetability and cheese yield. The indigenous Norwegian goat breed is characterized by a remarkably high frequency (> 70 %) of a "null" variant of <b>alpha(s</b> 1) -casein unique to this population. This mutation, referred to as the exon 12 D allele, involves a single base deletion in exon 12 of the <b>alpha(s</b> 1) -casein gene. The aim of this study was to provide more detailed information on how <b>alpha(s</b> 1) -casein polymorphism affects composition and rennet coagulation properties of milk from Norwegian dairy goats. Class of <b>alpha(s</b> 1) -casein significantly affected milk composition; crude protein, casein and pH.

40|$|The calcified {{proteinaceous}} deposits, or corpora amylacea, of bovine {{mammary tissue}} often comprise {{a network of}} amyloid fibrils, the origins of which have not been fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate by transmission electron microscopy, dye binding assays, and X-ray fiber diffraction that bovine milk <b>alpha(s</b> 2) -casein, a protein synthesized and secreted by mammary epithelial cells, readily forms fibrils in vitro. As a component of whole <b>alpha(s)</b> -casein, <b>alpha(s</b> 2) -casein was separated from <b>alpha(s</b> 1) -casein under nonreducing conditions via cation-exchange chromatography. Upon incubation at neutral pH and 37 degrees C, the spherical particles typical of <b>alpha(s</b> 2) -casein rapidly converted to twisted, ribbon-like fibrils similar to 12 nm in diameter, which occasionally formed loop structures. Despite. their irregular morphology, these fibrils possessed a P-sheet core structure {{and the ability to}} bind amyloidophilic dyes such as thioflavin T. Fibril formation was optimal at pH 6. 5 - 6. 7 and was promoted by higher incubation temperatures. Interestingly, the protein appeared to be less prone to fibril formation upon disulfide bond reduction with dithiothreitol. Thus, (<b>alpha(s</b> 2) -casein is particularly susceptible to fibril formation under physiological conditions. However, our findings indicate that <b>alpha(s</b> 2) -casein fibril formation is potently inhibited by its natural counterparts <b>alpha(s</b> 1) -casein, while is Only partially inhibited by beta-casein.
