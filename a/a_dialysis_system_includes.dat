40|$|Background: Biofilms are {{bacterial}} communities ubiquitous to moist environments. Biofilm {{formation is}} a factor in the development and persistence of infectious diseases. In clinical nephrology, biofilms influence the development of kidney stones and affect <b>dialysis</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>including</b> peritoneal and central venous catheters. Biofilms also play critical roles in persistent and resistant renal and urinary tract infections. Objective: To describe the physiology of biofilms and potential effects of biofilms upon infectious diseases, focusing on the role of biofilms in kidney stones, indwelling catheters and <b>dialysis</b> equipment. Methods: <b>A</b> literature search with Medline to identify pertinent English language articles published up to early 2008 using the keywords biofilm, nephrology, renal, calculi and infection.

Studies using this system indicated that only traces of NH 4 -N were present as impurities in organic nitrogen compounds such as urea, aspartic acid, lysine and histidine. Positive and negative interferences in the NH 4 -N determination were attributed to hydrolysis or participation of the organic nitrogen compounds in the colorimetric reaction. These positive and negative interferences were eliminated by gas dialysis.

40|$|Specific dietary requirements, e. g. celiac disease, {{as well as}} {{increased}} consumer demand for products of high nutritional value, makes the production of pasta from alternative cereals interesting. Raw material characterisation showed that the utilisation of oat and teff flour is beneficial as these ingredients contain higher levels of fibre and mineral composition is superior to that of wheat. Starch properties significantly influence pasta quality and therefore damaged starch levels, amylase activity, pasting properties and gelatinisation temperatures of the flours were investigated. Fresh egg pasta based on wheat, oat and teff flour was produced. Sensory properties of oat spaghetti {{were found to be}} very close to that of wheat pasta but improvement of smoothness and aroma is necessary, while teff spaghetti showed reduced sensory quality. An invitro enzymatic digestion was performed using <b>a</b> <b>dialysis</b> <b>system</b> to mimic the behaviour of pasta as eaten and make predictions on the glycemic index (GI). The predicted GI was highest for wheat pasta, followed by teff and oat.

40|$|Detection of endotoxin-like interleukin- 1 -inducing {{activity}} during in vitro dialysis. In order {{to study the}} integrity of dialysis membranes to pyrogens, the dialysate side of a closed loop hemodialysis (HD) circuit was challenged with E. coli microfiltrate containing 500 ng/ml endotoxin. Three solutions, a) tissue culture medium/saline, b) 5 % human serum albumin, and c) 10 % fresh human plasma, were circulated in the blood loop for five hours. Samples drawn from the blood side were assayed for interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) -inducing activity on human mononuclear cells (MNC) in vitro. No IL- 1 -inducing substances were detected when saline or culture medium was circulated in the blood loop. Circulating 5 % human serum albumin revealed IL- 1 -inducing activity in the samples drawn only after five hours of HD. However, the addition of 10 % fresh human plasma to the blood side resulted in the appearance of an IL- 1 -inducing substance(s) after 15 minutes of HD. After 30 minutes, maximum IL- 1 -inducing activity was observed (control stimulation index, 3. 30 ± 0. 67 SEM VS. 7. 59 ± 1. 50, (P < 0. 02). The IL- 1 -inducing activity of the samples was completely inhibited by polymyxin B, a cationic antibiotic which blocks the IL- 1 -inducing activity of endotoxin. Additional experiments demonstrated that in vitro MNC IL- 1 -production induced by the same E. coli microfiltrate is enhanced {{in the presence of}} 10 % plasma. These studies demonstrate that: (a) in the presence of plasma, IL- 1 -inducing factors pass into the blood compartment of <b>a</b> <b>dialysis</b> <b>system</b> challenged with bacterial pyrogen; and (b) MNC production of IL- 1 is enhanced in the presence of plasma.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{processing}} treatments on {{the rate of}} starch digestibility in three legumes, viz., bengal gram (Cicer arietinum L.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and green gram (Vigna radiata) was studied using <b>an</b> in vitro <b>dialysis</b> <b>system.</b> The processes studied were fermentation, germination, pressure cooking and roasting. The released sugars measured as glucose equivalents after 3 h digestion were expressed as digestibility index (DI).

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>a</b> gas <b>dialysis</b> <b>system</b> proved that ammonium-N recovery was inversely proportion to acceptor flow rate. The relationship between amonia trapping and acceptor flow rate {{was considered a}} crucial parameter and the best flow rate for donor and acceptor streams was chosen {{for the analysis of}} water and extract samples. The Technicon silicon gas dialysis membrane showed very low ammonia transference. Polytetrafluoroethene (PTFE) membranes allowed higher amounts of ammonia to be transferred through them. Recovery of ammonia using the standard 6 inch dialyser was 56. 7 percent. Analysis at 20 samples per hour showed adequate peak separation and good peak shapes. The standard deviation of the results was between 0. 002 and 0. 004 for a 1 mg l - 1 ammonium-N solution. Calibration curves were linear (y= 4. 14 + 15. 7 x, r 2 = 0. 99 and y= 5. 11 + 42. 82 x, r 2 = 0. 98).

During SCD therapy, citrate is administered to lower ionized calcium levels in blood for anticoagulation and inhibition of leukocyte activation. Historically, citrate has been known to interfere with sorbent <b>dialysis,</b> therefore, posing <b>a</b> potential issue for the use of SCD therapy with <b>a</b> portable <b>dialysis</b> <b>system.</b> This sorbent <b>dialysis</b> SCD (sorbent SCD) would be well suited for battlefield and natural disaster applications where the water supply for standard dialysis is limited, and the types of injuries in those settings would benefit from SCD therapy.

The hypothesis to be assessed was whether the citrate load required by the SCD could be metabolized prior to recirculation from systemic blood back into the therapeutic circuit. Despite the fact that the sorbent SCD maintained urea clearance without any adverse hematologic events, citrate load for SCD therapy caused an interaction with the sorbent column resulting in elevated, potentially toxic aluminum levels in dialysate and in systemic blood. Alternative strategies to implement sorbent‐SCD therapy will be required, including development of alternate urease‐sorbent column binding chemistry or further changes to the sorbent‐SCD therapeutic circuit along with determining the minimum citrate concentration required for efficacious SCD treatment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of {{biopolymer}} encapsulation on the digestion of total lipids and cholesterol in egg yolk using an in vitro human digestion model. Egg yolks were encapsulated with 1 % cellulose, pectin, or chitosan. The samples were then passed through an in vitro human digestion model that simulated the composition of mouth saliva, stomach acid, and the intestinal juice of the small intestine by using <b>a</b> <b>dialysis</b> tubing <b>system.</b> The change in digestion of total lipids was monitored by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The digestion rate of total lipids and cholesterol in all egg yolk samples dramatically increased after in vitro human digestion. The digestion rate of total lipids and cholesterol in egg yolks encapsulated with chitosan or pectin was reduced compared to the digestion rate of total lipids and cholesterol in other egg yolk samples. Egg yolks encapsulated with pectin or chitosan had lower free fatty acid content, and lipid oxidation values than samples without biopolymer encapsulation. Moreover, the lipase activity decreased, after in vitro digestion, in egg yolks encapsulated with biopolymers.

40|$|Background: Hemodialysis is {{complicated}} by {{a high incidence of}} intradialytic hypotension and disequilibrium symptoms caused by hypovolemia and a decrease in extracellular osmolarity. Automatic adaptive <b>system</b> <b>dialysis</b> (AASD) is <b>a</b> proprietary <b>dialysis</b> <b>system</b> that provides automated elaboration of dialysate and ultrafiltration profiles based on the prescribed decrease in body weight and sodium content. Study Design: A noncontrolled (single arm), multicenter, prospective, clinical trial. Setting & Participants: 55 patients with intradialytic hypotension or disequilibrium syndrome in 15 dialysis units were studied over a 1 -month interval using standard treatment (642 sessions) followed by 6 months using AASD (2, 376 sessions). Intervention: AASD (bicarbonate dialysis with dialysate sodium concentration and ultrafiltration rate profiles determined by the automated procedure). Outcomes: Primary and major secondary outcomes were the frequency of intradialytic hypotension and symptoms (hypotensive events, headache, nausea, vomiting, and cramps), respectively. Results: More stable intradialytic systolic and diastolic blood pressures with lower heart rate were found using AASD compared with standard treatment. Sessions complicated by hypotension decreased from 58. 7 % +/- 7. 3 % to 0. 9 % +/- 0. 6 % (P < 0. 001). The incidence of other disequilibrium syndrome symptoms was lower in patients receiving AASD. There were no differences in end-session body weight, interdialytic weight gain, or presession natremia between the standard and AASD treatment periods. Limitations: A noncontrolled (single arm) study, no crossover from AASD to standard treatment. Conclusions: This study shows the long-term clinical efficacy of AASD for intradialytic hypotension and disequilibrium symptoms in a large number of patients and dialysis sessions.

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>dialysis</b> {{cultivation}} <b>system</b> {{was used}} to enrich slow-growing moderately thermophilic anaerobic bacteria at high cell densities. Bicarbonate buffered mineral salts medium with 5 mM glutamate as the sole carbon and energy source was used and the incubation temperature was 55 degrees C. The reactor inoculum originated from anaerobic methanogenic granular sludge bed reactors. The microbial population was monitored {{over a period of}} 2 years using the most probable number (MPN) technique. In the reactor glutamate was readily degraded to ammonium, methane, and carbon dioxide. Cell numbers of glutamate-degrading organisms increased 400 -fold over the first year. In medium supplemented with bromoethane sulfonic acid (BES, an inhibitor of methanogenesis), tenfold lower cell numbers were counted, indicating the syntrophic nature of glutamate degradation. After 2 years of reactor operation the predominant organisms were isolated and characterized. Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (strain R 43) and a Methanosaeta thermophila strain (strain A) were the predominant hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens, respectively. The numbers in which the organisms were present in the reactor after 24 months of incubation were 8. 6 x 10 (9) and 3. 8 x 10 (7) mL(- 1) sludge, respectively. The most predominant glutamate-degrading organism (8. 6 x 10 (7) mL(- 1) sludge), strain Z, was identified as a new species, Caloramator coolhaasii.

The Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) is <b>an</b> albumin-based <b>dialysis</b> <b>system</b> designed to enhance the excretory function of a failing liver. MARS has been successfully used in patients affected by advanced liver disease and presenting with severe cholestasis. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of MARS in patients with liver dysfunction after OLT. Seven patients (primary nonfunction, 2 patients; graft dysfunction, 5 patients) fulfilled the inclusion criteria of serum bilirubin level > 15 mg/dL and least 1 of the following clinical signs: hepatic encephalopathy (HE) > or = grade II, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and intractable pruritus. Graft and patient survival rates at 6 months were 42. 8 % and 57. 1 %, respectively. All patients tolerated MARS treatment, with no adverse event. In all patients, a decrease in serum bilirubin (P <. 05), bile acids (P <. 05), serum creatinine, and ammonia levels was observed after treatment with MARS. A considerable improvement of HE, as well as renal and synthetic liver functions, was observed in 4 of 5 patients with graft dysfunction, but not among those with primary nonfunction. The patients with intractable pruritus showed significant improvement of this symptom after MARS therapy. Thus, MARS is a safe, therapeutic option for the treatment of liver dysfunction after OLT.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to produce a fully {{automated}} prototype system {{for the treatment of}} premature babies who are suffering from renal failure or metabolic disorders. These patients are difficult or impossible to treat conventionally, due to their very small total blood volume and their intolerance to donated blood. There was a strong case for developing <b>a</b> <b>dialysis</b> <b>system</b> specifically designed for the treatment of such patients. The system is based on a manually operated device developed at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle Upon Tyne. It differs from conventional dialysis methods in several ways. Blood access to the patient is via a single venous catheter. Only a very small amount of blood is needed to prime the extracorporeal circuit - this can be as little as 6. 8 ml in the smallest patients. This compares very favourably with the volumes needed in conventional circuits, which are in the range of 15 - 40 ml. This small priming volume means that donated blood is not needed to prime the circuit. The clearance and ultrafiltration rates that can be achieved are independent of the rate that blood can be accessed from the patient, since the same blood passes back and forth through the haemofilter several times. The clearances that have been obtained experimentally are consistently above 40 % of the mean blood flow rate through the system. The largest mean blood flow rate available is 5 ml/min, so the maximum clearance is approximately 2 ml/min. The maximum ultrafiltration rate that can be obtained is 50 ml/h. The new system is more effective at treating premature babies than conventional dialysis circuits. The hand driven system was tested in vivo and found to work well, so the automated system was developed on a solid foundation. A prototype system has been successfully developed and tested. This thesis details both the development and the testing. The new system uses stepper motors and DC servo motors for actuation, and is controlled by Labwindows/CVI and NIDAQ software running on a standard PC platform. The interface between the PC and the machine is provided by a National Instruments data acquisition board. A comprehensive single fault analysis of the safety of the <b>system</b> was undertaken, <b>including</b> both software and hardware. In vitro testing covered several areas of operation. The accuracy of the ultrafiltration process was established. The clearance rates that could be achieved were determined. The amount of damage caused to the blood by the system was also tested. This was found to be well within acceptable clinical limits. In vivo testing established the feasibility of using a computer algorithm to control the withdrawal of blood from the patient. Finally, the system was successfully used to treat a patient with an in-born metabolic disorder. In summary, a new system has been developed that is superior to any other treatment method currently available for neonates with these types of disorders...|$|R

The bioaccessibility of OTA from the spiked red wine (1. 0, 2. 0 and 4 µg/l) was high in the gastric compartment (102. 8, 128. 3 and 122. 3 %, respectively), whereas in the simulated intestine, it did not exceed 26 %, and the amount of OTA that crossed the dialysis membrane was very low (< 3. 3 %). The amount of OTα in gastric chyme ranged from 5. 1 to 19. 1 % of the spiked OTA, whereas in the intestinal compartment it did not exceed 5 %.

Our data showed that cells tended to adhere with more efficiency to CU than to the synthetic dialyzers. Circulation in the in vitro dialysis circuit resulted in the rapid (5 min) formation of [3 H]DAG (CU 1. 95 -; PS 1. 34 -; PAN 1. 24 -fold increase over untreated cells). The DAG level peaked at 15 to 30 minutes and remained constant thereafter (CU 1. 70; PS 1. 96; PAN 1. 66). When we measured DAG formation in cells that had been kept in the dialyzers without circulation, we found that cells exposed to CU showed a much higher and rapid activation than those exposed to PS or PAN, as if CU per se was able to activate early cell signaling (CU 1. 95 -; PS 0. 97 -; PAN 1. 09 -; DAG, -fold increase over control). These data indicate that exposure to, and circulation through dialyzers activated early transmembrane signaling in human leukocytes, and that different dialysis membranes showed distinct effects on cell adhesion and stimulation...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{molecular}} adsorbent {{recirculating system}} (MARS) is <b>an</b> extracorporeal liver <b>dialysis</b> <b>system</b> that allows selective removal of bilirubin and other albumin-bound toxins. We reported here our {{experience with the}} use of this technique for management of liver failure at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. Methods: From December 2002 to 2004, a total of 74 MARS sessions were performed on 22 patients. The cause of liver failure included acute liver failure (n = 2), acute on chronic liver failure (n = 12), posthepatectomy liver failure (n = 4), and posttransplantation allograft failure (n = 4). Results: MARS treatment showed significant reduction in total bilirubin level, serum ammonia level and blood urea, and nitrogen (P< 0. 001 for all three parameters). Five patients (22. 7 %) were able to bridge to transplantation and one patient (4. 5 %) made a spontaneous recovery. The 30 -day mortality rate was 72. 7 %. Conclusions: Our results indicated that MARS can effectively improve serum biochemistry and is suitable for temporarily supporting patients with liver failure where transplantation is not immediately available. There is, however, no clear evidence showing that MARS can increase survival, improve the chance of transplantation or assist liver regeneration. Future studies in the form of randomized-controlled trials are crucial to characterize the true potential of this treatment. © 2006 Blackwell Munksgaard. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of calcium}} at 300 and 1500 µM on P {{nutrition}} were assessed in eight strains of Rhizobium meliloti in defined liquid medium. Evaluations included: P storage from "luxury " external concentration (1000 µM P); utilization of stored P after transfer to unreplenished low-P medium (0. 06 µM); and growth at low concentrations of P buffered at 5, 0. 5, and 0. 06 µM with <b>an</b> iron oxide <b>dialysis</b> <b>system.</b> The strains stored P in luxury medium, but unlike other rhizobia, they needed high Ca {{to utilize the}} stored P. They either grew or died following transfer to low-P medium, depending on the Ca concentration and the Ca concentration at which they had grown previously. Ability to grow in media buffered at low P concentrations also contrasted with that of other rhizobia, in two respects: no strain of R. meliloti grew at 0. 06 µM P, regardless of Ca concentration; and some strains needed high Ca to grow at 0. 5 and 5 µM P. Two isolates from Medicago rugosa and Melilotus indica were less Ca-demanding than six isolates from Medicago sativa. Previous reports that R. meliloti has low calcium requirements may be correct only for the luxury P levels that are conventional in defined media. Our evidence for high Ca requirement at realistic P concentrations agrees with data from soil experiments...|$|R
40|$|Different {{models of}} {{isolated}} and perfused livers and precision cut liver slices {{have been developed}} for studies on liver toxicology the past years. As most of these models were limited by nonphysiologi c settings, a new model of normothermic hemoperfused isolated porcine slaughterhouse livers to examine hepatotoxicity was established encompassing the advantages of slaughterhouse organs to reduce animal experiments and autologous blood as an optimal perfusate. As model compound, the analgesic substance diclofenac was used and the effects of this drug on organ function parameters were compared to an untreated control group. Using an amount of 2, 000 ml, the organs were perfused over 180 minutes, metabolically controlled via <b>a</b> <b>dialysis</b> and oxygenation <b>system</b> and various hematological and hepatic parameters were examined. In contrast to the untreated control organs, signi cant differences were found in the diclofenac group for parameters such as lactate, creatinine, ALT, bicarbonate, or bile ow. In summary, the presently established model of isolated hemoperfused slaughterhouse livers displays a useful new approach to assess hepatotoxicity of different substances on the organ level. As a major economic advantage in comparison to setups using laboratory animals, the new model can be run with blood and organs obtained from slaughterhouse animals...|$|R
40|$|Given that liver failure {{continues}} to pose an enormous clinical challenge, {{the concept of}} hepatic dialysis has enjoyed significant interest. In particular, many investigations have examined the therapeutic mechanisms and efficacy of artificial albumin <b>dialysis</b> based <b>systems</b> in acute on chronic liver failure, the results {{of which have been}} conflicting. Albumin <b>dialysis</b> <b>systems</b> do not appear to significantly decrease serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in severe acute on chronic liver failure. Thus, if these treatments do result in clinical improvement, then other therapeutic mechanisms must be involved. In a previous issue of Critical Care, Stadlbauer and colleagues [1] examined the effects of two artificial albumin <b>dialysis</b> <b>systems</b> on the removal of cytokines in the setting of acute on chronic liver failure.

40|$|This {{long-term}} {{study on}} the outcome of permanent silicone single-lumen dialysis catheters consisted of 43 surgically inserted catheters in 33 patients. All catheters were attached to <b>a</b> pressure-pressure single-cannula <b>dialysis</b> <b>system.</b> Technique and catheter survival were 80 and 59 % at 1 year, and 63 and 50 % at the 3 rd year respectively. These parameters were not different in older patients (greater-than-or-equal-to 70 years, n = 12). Factors corresponding to a less successful outcome were placement in the left jugular vein (3 -month actuarial survival of 44 %) and absence of distal side holes (1 -year actuarial survival of 44 %). Insertion in both subclavian veins was not different to the classical right jugular vein. Infectious complications (incidence of 0. 72 per 1000 catheter,days) often caused simultaneous catheter and technique failure (14 versus 15 %), whereas inadequate flow (incidence of 2 per 1000 catheter days) caused catheter rather than technique failure (30 versus 12 %). The incidence of both complications declined significantly with time after insertion during the follow-up period. The first 3 months after insertion were more predisposed to the occurrence of inadequate flow than catheter-related infections. The general performance of these permanent single-lumen catheter devices justifies their long-term application in haemodialysis, even as a first choice of vascular access, especially in the elderly. Insertion in the left jugular vein and use of catheters without side holes should be avoided, providing a better catheter survival...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background End-stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) confers a large health-care burden for the United States, and the {{morbidity}} associated with vascular access failure has stimulated research into detection of vascular access stenosis and low flow prior to thrombosis. We present data investigating {{the possibility of}} using differential pressure (ΔP) monitoring to estimate access flow (Q) for dialysis access monitoring, with the goal of utilizing micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) pressure sensors integrated within the shaft of <b>dialysis</b> needles. Methods <b>A</b> model of the arteriovenous graft fluid circuit was used to study the relationship between Q and the ΔP between two dialysis needles placed 2. 5 – 20. 0 cm apart. Tubing was varied to simulate grafts with inner diameters of 4. 76 – 7. 95 mm. Data were compared with values from two steady-flow models. These results, and those from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of ΔP as a function of needle position, were used to devise and test a method of estimating Q using ΔP and variable dialysis pump speeds (variable flow) that diminishes dependence on geometric factors and fluid characteristics. Results In the fluid circuit model, ΔP increased with increasing volume flow rate and with increasing needle-separation distance. A nonlinear model closely predicts this ΔP-Q relationship (R 2 > 0. 98) for all graft diameters and needle-separation distances tested. CFD modeling suggested turbulent needle effects are greatest within 1 cm of the needle tip. Utilizing linear, quadratic and combined variable flow algorithms, dialysis access flow was estimated using geometry-independent models and <b>an</b> experimental <b>dialysis</b> <b>system</b> with the pressure sensors separated from the dialysis needle tip by distances ranging from 1 to 5 cm. Real-time ΔP waveform data were also observed during the mock dialysis treatment, which may be useful in detecting low or reversed flow within the access. Conclusion With further experimentation and needle design, this geometry-independent approach may prove to be a useful access flow monitoring method. </p...|$|R
