5|$|Because of the {{hazardous}} nature of lead(II) nitrate, {{there is a}} preference for using alternatives in industrial <b>applications.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> formerly major application of lead paints, it has largely been replaced by titanium dioxide. Other historical applications of lead(II) nitrate, such as in matches and fireworks, have declined or ceased as well. Current applications of lead(II) nitrate include use as a heat stabiliser in nylon and polyesters, as a coating for photothermographic paper, and in rodenticides.|$|E

The main biological functions of lipids include storing energy, signaling, and acting as structural components of cell membranes.

40|$|The topic {{chosen for}} this project is 2 ̆ 2 The Necessity and Use of <b>Application</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Expository Sermon. 2 ̆ 2 It is this writer 2 ̆ 7 s {{contention}} that application is the least understood, least used and most abused element of the expository sermon. Application {{is one of the}} most necessary elements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> expository sermon, yet remains one of the most overlooked and ignored features of the preaching event. This project will first establish <b>the</b> need for <b>application</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> expository sermon, examine methods of application and give comprehensive recommendations for using <b>application</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> expository sermon. The writer 2 ̆ 7 s intent is clear; to point out <b>the</b> value of <b>application</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of the preaching event and to discover and discern the most valuable and practical tools available to use <b>application</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most effective manner. This project will be of valuable use to this preacher as well as all those who desire to connect the never-changing biblical truth to the ever-changing modern world. The project will begin with a clear description of <b>application</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> expository sermon. Definitions will be offered and examples will be given to clearly define <b>the</b> meaning of <b>application</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> expository sermon. Next, the Bible will be used to support the use of and call for <b>application</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> expository sermon. After a biblically based mandate for application, different methods of application will be studied. A broad sample of preachers from different churches, denominations, areas and levels will be studied to determine the different types of application. Finally, the writer will offer a preferred model for application and point to its value to the preacher and to the hearer...|$|R

5|$|Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg {{released}} the first coated electrodes. Strohmenger used clay and lime coating {{to stabilize the}} arc, while Kjellberg dipped iron wire into mixtures of carbonates and silicates to coat the electrode. In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity. In 1927, {{the development of an}} extrusion process reduced the cost of coating electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex coating mixtures designed for specific <b>applications.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, manufacturers introduced iron powder into the flux coating, making it possible to increase the welding speed.|$|E
5|$|Biogeography has a {{long history}} in the natural {{sciences}} concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical <b>applications</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.|$|E
5|$|Cooperative {{multitasking}} {{made its}} Macintosh debut in March 1985 {{with a program}} called Switcher by Andy Hertzfeld, which allowed the user to launch multiple applications and switch between them. Many programs and features did not function correctly with Switcher. Also, Switcher did not display windows of other applications beside the selected one. It was not included with the operating system, but was available from Apple for purchase separately. Both System 5 and System 6 had a feature called MultiFinder instead, which was much more mature and widely used in System 6. MultiFinder could be enabled or disabled, with a reboot. If disabled, the Finder would quit when the user launched another application, thus freeing RAM for it. If enabled, the system behaved as in the nowadays familiar multitasking tradition, with the desktop and windows of other <b>applications</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> screen's background.|$|E

5|$|Seaborg was the {{principal}} or co-discoverer of ten elements: plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and element 106, which, {{while he was still}} living, was named seaborgium in his honor. He also discovered more than 100 atomic isotopes and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the Manhattan Project where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the second atomic bomb. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and discovered isotopes of elements with important <b>applications</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diagnosis and treatment of diseases, most notably iodine-131, which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease. In addition to his theoretical work {{in the development of the}} actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series.|$|E

5|$|The all-pairs widest path {{problem has}} <b>applications</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Schulze method for {{choosing}} {{a winner in}} multiway elections in which voters rank the candidates in preference order. The Schulze method constructs a complete directed graph in which the vertices represent the candidates and every two vertices are connected by an edge. Each edge is directed from the winner to the loser of a pairwise contest between the two candidates it connects, and is labeled with the margin of victory of that contest. Then the method computes widest paths between all pairs of vertices, {{and the winner is}} the candidate whose vertex has wider paths to each opponent than vice versa. The results of an election using this method are consistent with the Condorcet method – a candidate who wins all pairwise contests automatically wins the whole election – but it generally allows a winner to be selected, even in situations where the Concorcet method itself fails. The Schulze method has been used by several organizations including the Wikimedia Foundation.|$|E
