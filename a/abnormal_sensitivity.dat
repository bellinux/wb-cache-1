As an administrator {{he was one of the}} greatest public servants in British history; in politics he was a principal architect of the modern conservative tradition. By insisting on changes unpalatable to many of his party, he helped to preserve the flexibility of the parliamentary system and the survival of aristocratic influence. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 won him immense prestige in the country, and his death in 1850 caused a national demonstration of sorrow unprecedented since the death of William Pitt in 1806.|$|E

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{identify}} a cut-off value for self-reported, <b>abnormal</b> cold <b>sensitivity</b> and {{to identify}} cold sensitivity predictors after hand injuries. The Cold Intolerance Symptom Severity (CISS) questionnaire and a VAS question concerning discomfort on exposure to cold were investigated in 94 normal people and 88 patients. A CISS score > 450 was defined as <b>abnormal</b> cold <b>sensitivity.</b> Multiple injured digits, an increased number of injured vessels, complete nerve injury and replantation were variables associated with high VAS scores. Factors linked to both abnormality and worse CISS or VAS scores were: the presence of bone injury; {{a larger number of}} repaired vessels; the use of vascular grafts and a high Hand Injury Severity Score (HISS). The causes of abnormality and severity suggest a multifactorial aetiology with bony, vascular and neural components.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: TDD and vibration detection were examined on the dorsum of the feet in 43 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and clinical signs and symptoms indicating mild neuropathy, and abnormal results for neurography, temperature detection, or heart rate variability. Test-retest examination of TDD was performed in nine of the patients. RESULTS: Twenty-six of the patients had <b>abnormal</b> TDD (<b>sensitivity</b> 0. 60) and 20 had <b>abnormal</b> vibration detection (<b>sensitivity</b> 0. 46). Ten of the patients had abnormal TDD and normal vibration detection. Four of the patients had abnormal vibration detection and normal TDD.

40|$|Abstract Background Cold {{sensitivity}} is {{a common}} and disabling complaint following hand injuries. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to describe self-reported consequences of cold sensitivity and the association with disability and health-related quality of life in patients with hand injuries or hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) and in normal subjects. Methods Responses to the Cold Intolerance Symptom Severity (CISS) questionnaire, Potential Work Exposure Scale (PWES), Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and Short-Form 36 questionnaire (SF- 36) were investigated in normal subjects (n = 94), hand injured patients (amputation and nerve injuries, n = 88) and patients with HAVS (n = 30). The results are presented as median (range), percent and mean deviation from norms. The Kruskal Wallis Test or Mann-Whitney U-Test were used to identify significant differences between multiple groups or subgroups. The Spearman rank correlation was used to study the relationship between cold sensitivity and disability. Results <b>Abnormal</b> cold <b>sensitivity</b> (CISS score > 50) was seen in 75 % and 45 % of patients with HAVS and a traumatic hand injury, respectively. Patients were significantly more exposed to cold in their work environment than the normal population, with a consequently negative effect on work ability due to cold <b>sensitivity.</b> Patients with <b>abnormal</b> cold <b>sensitivity</b> were more seriously disabled and had a poorer health-related quality of life than patients with normal cold sensitivity [higher DASH scores and e. g. significantly larger mean deviation from norms in the subscales Role Physical and Bodily Pain (SF- 36) ]. Conclusion Severe and <b>abnormal</b> cold <b>sensitivity</b> may have a profound impact on work capacity, leisure, disability and health-related quality of life.

Tyrosine aminotransferase is {{the first in a series}} of five enzymes that converts tyrosine to smaller molecules, which are excreted by the kidneys or used in reactions that produce energy. This form of the disorder can affect the eyes, skin, and mental development. Symptoms often begin in early childhood and include excessive tearing, <b>abnormal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to light (photophobia), eye pain and redness, and painful skin lesions on the palms and soles. About half of individuals with type II tyrosinemia are also mentally challenged. Type II tyrosinemia occurs in fewer than 1 in 250,000 individuals.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} nerve types can be {{subjected}} to neurapraxia and therefore symptoms of the injury range in degree and intensity. Common symptoms of neurapraxia are disturbances in sensation, weakness of muscle, vasomotor and sudomotor paralysis {{in the region of}} the affected nerve or nerves, and <b>abnormal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the nerve at the point of injury. It has been observed that subjective sensory symptoms include numbness, tingling, and burning sensations {{at the site of the}} injury. Objective sensory symptoms are generally minimal in regards to touch, pain, heat, and cold. In cases of motor neuron neurapraxia, symptoms consist of flaccid paralysis of the muscles innervated by the injured nerve or nerves.Symptoms are often transient and only last for a short period of time immediately following the injury. However, in severe cases of neurapraxia, symptoms can persist for weeks or months at a time.|$|E
40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{sphingolipids}} {{are essential for}} cell growth. Inactivation of sphingolipid biosynthesis, such as by disrupting the serine palmitoyltransferase gene (LCB 2), is lethal, but cells can be rescued by supplying an exogenous LCB (long-chain base) like PHS (phytosphingosine) or DHS (dihydrosphingosine). In the present study, supplying SPH (sphingosine), an unnatural LCB for yeast, similarly rescued the Δlcb 2 cells, but only when SPH 1 -phosphate production was inhibited by deleting the LCB kinase gene LCB 4. Exogenously added SPH was adequately converted into phosphoinositol-containing complex sphingolipids. Interestingly, cells carrying SPH-based sphingolipids exhibited a defect in the association of Pma 1 p with Triton X- 100 -insoluble membrane fractions, and displayed sensitivities to both Ca 2 + and hygromycin B. These {{results suggest that the}} SPH-based sphingolipids in these cells have properties that differ from those of the PHS- or DHS-based sphingolipids in regard to lipid microdomain formation, leading to <b>abnormal</b> <b>sensitivities</b> towards certain environmental stresses. The present paper is the first report showing that in sphingolipid-deficient S. cerevisiae, the requirement for LCB can be fulfilled by exogenous SPH, although this supplement results in failure of lipid microdomain formation...|$|R
40|$|In {{skeletal}} muscle excitation–contraction (E–C) coupling, the depolarization signal is converted from the intracellular Ca 2 + store into Ca 2 + release by functional coupling between the cell surface voltage sensor and the Ca 2 + release channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The signal conversion {{occurs in the}} junctional membrane complex known as the triad junction, where the invaginated plasma membrane called the transverse-tubule (T-tubule) is pinched from both sides by SR membranes. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} junctophilins (JPs) contribute to the formation of the junctional membrane complexes by spanning the intracellular store membrane and interacting with the plasma membrane (PM) in excitable cells. Of the three JP subtypes, both type 1 (JP- 1) and type 2 (JP- 2) are abundantly expressed in {{skeletal muscle}}. To examine the physiological role of JP- 1 in skeletal muscle, we generated mutant mice lacking JP- 1. The JP- 1 knockout mice showed no milk suckling and died shortly after birth. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that triad junctions were reduced in number, and that the SR was often structurally abnormal in the skeletal muscles of the mutant mice. The mutant muscle developed less contractile force (evoked by low-frequency electrical stimuli) and showed <b>abnormal</b> <b>sensitivities</b> to extracellular Ca 2 +. Our results indicate that JP- 1 contributes to the construction of triad junctions and that it is essential for the efficiency of signal conversion during E–C coupling in skeletal muscle...|$|R

5000|$|Diphenhydramine is {{a potent}} {{anticholinergic}} agent. This activity {{is responsible for the}} side effects of dry mouth and throat, increased heart rate, pupil dilation, urinary retention, constipation, and, at high doses, hallucinations or delirium. Other side effects include motor impairment (ataxia), flushed skin, blurred vision at nearpoint owing to lack of accommodation (cycloplegia), <b>abnormal</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to bright light (photophobia), sedation, difficulty concentrating, short-term memory loss, visual disturbances, irregular breathing, dizziness, irritability, itchy skin, confusion, increased body temperature (in general, in the hands and/or feet), temporary erectile dysfunction, and excitability, and although {{it can be used to}} treat nausea, higher doses may cause vomiting. Some side effects, such as twitching, may be delayed until the drowsiness begins to cease and the person is in more of an awakening mode. [...] Acute poisoning can be fatal, leading to cardiovascular collapse and death in 2-18 hours, and in general is treated using a symptomatic and supportive approach. Diagnosis of toxicity is based on history and clinical presentation, and in general specific levels are not useful. Several levels of evidence strongly indicate diphenhydramine (similar to chlorpheniramine [...] ) can block the delayed rectifier potassium channel and, as a consequence, prolong the QT interval, leading to cardiac arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes.No specific antidote for diphenhydramine toxicity is known, but the anticholinergic syndrome has been treated with physostigmine for severe delirium or tachycardia. Benzodiazepines may be administered to decrease the likelihood of psychosis, agitation, and seizures in patients who are prone to these symptoms.|$|E

40|$|Tolerance to the {{analgesic}} {{effects of}} an opioid occurs after its chronic administration, a pharmacological phenomenon that {{has been associated with}} the development of <b>abnormal</b> pain <b>sensitivity</b> such as hyperalgesia. In the present study, we examined the role of spinal glutamate transporters (GTs) in the development of both morphine tolerance and associated thermal hyperalgesia. Chronic morphine administered through either intrathecal boluses or continuous infusion induced a dosedependent downregulation of GTs (EAAC 1 and GLAST) in the rat’s superficial spinal cord dorsal horn. This GT downregulation was mediated through opioid receptors because naloxone blocked such GT changes. Morphine-induced GT downregulation reduced the ability to maintain in vivo glutamate homeostasis at the spinal level, because the hyperalgesic response to exogenous glutamate was enhanced, including an increase...|$|R
