5|$|Thrombophilia (sometimes {{hypercoagulability}} or a prothrombotic state) is an abnormality {{of blood}} coagulation {{that increases the}} risk of thrombosis (blood clots in blood vessels). Such abnormalities can be identified in 50% of people who have an episode of thrombosis (such <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> vein thrombosis in the leg) that was not provoked by other causes. A significant proportion of the population has a detectable abnormality, but most of these only develop thrombosis in the presence of an additional risk factor.|$|E

5|$|By 1830, {{because of}} {{difficult}} economic conditions in Britain that reduced {{the demand for}} fossils, coupled with long gaps between major finds, Anning was having financial problems again. Her friend the geologist Henry De la Beche assisted her by commissioning Georg Scharf to make a lithographic print based on De la Beche's watercolour painting, Duria Antiquior, portraying life in prehistoric Dorset that was largely based on fossils Anning had found. De la Beche sold copies of the print to his fellow geologists and other wealthy friends and donated the proceeds to her. It became the first such scene from what later became known <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> time to be widely circulated. In December 1830 she finally made another major find, a skeleton of {{a new type of}} plesiosaur, which sold for £200.|$|E
5|$|Carter was {{interested}} in the possibility that extraterrestrials were involved in ancient mass extinctions on Earth and used these themes in the episode. Much of the episode was also inspired by Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ, and a scene showing an operation on Mulder has been thematically compared to the Crucifixion of Jesus. For the dream sequences, casting director Rick Millikan brought back many actors and actresses who had been absent from the show for several years, including Jerry Hardin <b>as</b> <b>Deep</b> Throat, Rebecca Toolan as Teena Mulder, and Megan Leitch as Samantha Mulder.|$|E
5|$|Chemical peels {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{appearance}} of acne scars. Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentrations (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30–40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect skin <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> as the papillary dermis. Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels. Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars, but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as milia.|$|E

Like his previous films, Emmanuel Lubezki did not use prior footage as the starting point of his work on Gravity. Instead, he carried out a search of images from NASA and Roscosmos. He and his team put together a large collection of photographs and picked what was best for the movie. Lubezki said that they based the visuals on descriptions from astronauts, with some artistic license in depicting how the stars looked during the daytime in space. He wanted to incorporate the stars as much as possible to feel <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> as possible and avoid plain darkness and two dimensional feeling.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying (also {{referred}} to <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, {{rather than the}} shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong southerly shear {{exposing the}} LLCC, Bonnie {{intensified}} slightly {{to reach its}} initial peak intensity with winds of 45mph (75km/h) as it turned towards the north. However, the continued effects of high wind shear and dry air caused the cyclone's appearance to significantly degrade early on May29, <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> convection dissipated due to more than 46mph (74km/h) of southerly shear. Bonnie weakened back to tropical depression strength {{about half an hour}} prior to its landfall just east of Charleston, South Carolina. Caught in weak steering currents, the depression meandered over South Carolina for over a day before degenerating to a remnant low over the northeastern portion of the state at 12:00UTC on May30.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Omar was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that took an unusual southwest to northeast track through the eastern Caribbean Sea during mid-October of 2008. Forming out of a tropical disturbance on October13, Omar initially moved slowly in the eastern Caribbean Sea. By October15, Omar began to quickly intensify <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> convection developed around the center of circulation. Later that day, an eye developed and the storm began to accelerate to the northeast. Early on October16, Omar reached its peak intensity with maximum winds of 130mph (215km/h) and a barometric pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg). Shortly after, the hurricane rapidly weakened to Category 1 intensity. After slightly re-strengthening the next day, Omar weakened to a tropical storm before degenerating into a non-convective low pressure area. The remnants of Omar persisted until October21 at which time it dissipated {{to the west of}} the Azores.|$|E
5|$|On August14, roughly 24hours after degenerating into {{a remnant}} low, {{convection}} began to redevelop over the system. Later that day, a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance plane deployed dropsondes into the system. They {{found that the}} system was regenerating and shortly after, the NHC began re-issuing advisories on the depression when it was located roughly 1,075mi (1,735km) east of the Leeward Islands. The depression continued to track westward {{in response to an}} upper-level high over the north Atlantic. Early on August15, the NHC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, giving it the name Ana <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> convection developed around the center of circulation. Later that day, wind shear caused convection to become displaced from the circulation, exposing the center of Ana again.|$|E

5|$|The East Pacific's Tropical Depression Eleven-E {{moved across}} Mexico and {{degenerated}} into a remnant low on September4. The mid-level circulation {{associated with the}} remnant storm entered the southern Bay of Campeche and formed a new tropical depression by 18:00UTC on September5. Steered north to north-northwest, the newly formed cyclone quickly strengthened <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> convection fired over its center; it intensified into Tropical Storm Hermine by 06:00UTC on September6 and attained peak winds of 70mph (110km/h) by 02:00UTC the following day as it made landfall near Matamoros, Mexico. Despite being well inland, Hermine continued to maintain an inner core and only slowly weakened. It fell to tropical depression status over central Texas by 00:00UTC on September8 and ultimately dissipated over southeastern Kansas by 06:00UTC on September10.|$|E
5|$|The {{drawing up}} {{of a regular}} season {{schedule}} had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league's inception. The crux {{of the problem was}} the scheduling of games meant weighing the interest of owners who, early in the season, wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their team's win-loss record. The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell the sole discretion in developing the league's schedule. He utilized this responsibility to, early in the season, pit the weaker teams against other weak teams, and the strong teams against other strong teams. His goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team standings to a minimum <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> into the season as possible.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Tam {{originated}} out {{of tropical}} depression while located about 370km (230mi) to the north-northeast of Fiji on January6. The system, designated 04F by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji tracked slowly towards the west. Although the depression was located within {{an area of}} low wind shear, little intensification occurred, {{as a lack of}} low-level moisture hindered the development of deep convection. By January9, shower and thunderstorm activity associated with the disturbance increased as it began to interact with the South Pacific Convergence Zone. Another tropical depression, 05F, also became increasingly organized and at one point was forecast to absorb 04F. Following the weakening of Tropical Depression 05F, 04F intensified. Around 2000UTC on January11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert <b>as</b> <b>deep</b> convection persisted around the center of circulation for several hours.|$|E
