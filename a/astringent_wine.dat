25|$|Grenache {{is often}} used as a {{blending}} component, adding body and sweet fruitiness to a wine. The grape can be troublesome for the winemaker due to tendency to oxidize easily and lose color. To compensate for the grape's naturally low tannins and phenolic compounds, some producers will use excessively harsh pressing and hot fermentation with stems to extract the maximal amount of color and phenols from the skins. This can backfire to produce green, herbaceous flavors and coarse, <b>astringent</b> <b>wine</b> lacking the grape's characteristic vibrant fruitiness. To maintain those character traits, Grenache responds best to a long, slow fermentation at cooler temperatures followed by a maceration period. To curb against oxidation, the wine should be racked as little as possible. The use of new oak barrels can help with retaining color and preventing oxidation but too much oak influence can cover up the fruitiness of Grenache.|$|E

A group of Barolo producers, led by the house of Ceretto, Paolo Cordero di Montezemolo, Elio Altare, and Renato Ratti, started making more modern, international styles of Barolos by using shorter periods for maceration (days as opposed to weeks) and fermentation (usually 4872 hours or at most 810 days), less time aging in new small oak barrels and {{an extended period of}} bottle aging prior to release. By using modern technology, including specialized tanks that allow the wine to be pumped out from underneath the cap of skins and then pumped over, they found ways to maximize color extraction and minimize harsh tannins. Prior to this [...] "modernist" [...] movement, Nebbiolo was often harvested slightly unripe and at high yields which left the grapes with harsh green tannins that had not had time to fully polymerize. To maximize color extraction, producers would subject the wine to extended periods of maceration, taking up to several weeks, and then several years aging in large oak casks to soften the wine. Through the long slow process of oxidation, the perception of tannins would lessen (such as occurs when decanting wine), but the fruit would also fade and become oxidized. The decline in fruit would {{no longer be able to}} balance the remaining harsh tannins, leaving a bitter, <b>astringent</b> <b>wine</b> with withered fruit. To counter this change, some producers would blend in other grape varieties such as Arneis and Barbera to add color, fruit or softness to the wine.|$|E
50|$|In the {{alcoholic}} drinks industry, congeners are substances produced during fermentation. These substances include {{small amounts of}} chemicals such as occasionally desired other alcohols, like propanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol, but also compounds that are never desired such as acetone, acetaldehyde and glycols. Congeners are {{responsible for most of}} the taste and aroma of distilled alcoholic drinks, and contribute to the taste of non-distilled drinks. It has been suggested that these substances contribute to the symptoms of a hangover. Tannins are congeners found in wine in the presence of phenolic compounds. Wine tannins add bitterness, have a drying sensation, taste herbaceous and are often described as <b>astringent.</b> <b>Wine</b> tannins adds balance, complexity, structure and makes a wine last longer, so they {{play an important role in}} the aging of wine.|$|E

5000|$|According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Bianchetta Trevigiana {{tends to}} produce [...] "ordinary" [...] and <b>astringent</b> <b>wines</b> {{which is why}} it is rarely seen as a varietal and is more often {{incorporated}} into blends.

25|$|In {{white wine}} production, {{pressing}} usually takes place immediately after crushing or/and before primary fermentation. In red wine production, the grapes are also crushed but pressing usually doesn't take place till after {{or near the}} end of fermentation with the time of skin contact between the juice and grapes leaching color, tannins and other phenolics from the skin. Approximately 60-70% of the available juice within the grape berry, the free-run juice, can be released by the crushing process and doesn't require the use of the press. The remaining 30-40% that comes from pressing can have higher pH levels, lower titratable acidity, potentially higher volatile acidity and higher phenolics than the free-run juice depending on the amount of pressure and tearing of the skins and will produce more <b>astringent,</b> bitter <b>wine.</b>|$|R

40|$|At ripening, Vitis vinifera cv Raboso Piave grapes {{have high}} acidity, {{which results in}} an <b>astringent</b> <b>wine</b> that {{is not easy to}} drink. To {{overcome}} this limitation, several researches have attempted to alter the polyphenols profile mainly by applying different harvest techniques. The aim of this work was to investigate sensorial, biochemical, and molecular changes in Raboso Piave grape berries subjected to delayed harvests as Late Harvest (LH) and "Double Maturation Raisonn√©e" (DMR) techniques. At the molecular level, a microarray study was conducted comparing Traditional Harvest berries (TH) to LH and DMR ones. Gene ontology enrichment analysis pointed out that LH and DMR techniques affected metabolism of acids, sugars and polyphenols. A Principal Component Analysis, performed on transcriptomic data, pointed out that malate catabolism as well as some branches of flavonoids biosynthesis are significantly affected by DMR. In DMR grape berries, the flavonol and catechin accumulations were induced and depressed, respectively. In parallel, the transcription of flavonol synthase and leucoanthocyanidin-reductase 2, the main genes responsible for flavonol and catechin biosynthesis, were similarly induced and down-regulated. These changes resulted in a brighter colored wine with lower astringency. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of white grapes in Australia are machine harvested. Machine harvesting inevitably results in berry breakage as grapes are shaken from vines. Contact between the expressed juice and grape skins prior to winery draining and pressing results in extraction of phenolic compounds from grape skins. These compounds can persist throughout the winemaking process and produce inferior bitter and <b>astringent</b> white <b>wines</b> {{with a greater}} tendency to brown. In this work laboratory studies of phenolic extraction were performed with three different batches of grapes, over a range of relevant temperatures, times, potassium metabisulfite additions (an additive commonly used with machine harvested grapes in vineyards) and degrees of berry breakage. Specific experiments were performed using full factorial designs with three levels of temperature, six levels of time, and either three levels of potassium metabisulfite addition or berry breakage. Two different juice fractions (corresponding with different yields) were collected for phenolic analysis. Time, temperature, potassium metabisulfite addition and berry breakage all significantly increased phenolic extraction. The relationship between phenolic extraction and the explanatory variables differed for the two juice fractions. Plots of phenolic extraction are presented together with results from multiple regression analysis. Simon Nordestgaard, Brian O'Neill[URL]...|$|R
2500|$|Widely grown {{throughout}} Abruzzo {{and central}} Italy (and believed by some ampelographers to be indigenous to the region), Montepulciano {{is the fifth}} most widely planted red grape variety in Italy ‚Äì behind Sangiovese, Barbera, Merlot, and Negroamaro. In Abruzzo, it is the principal grape behind the DOC wine Montepulciano d'Abruzzo where the grape is noted for producing darkly colored, tannic wines with low acidity, and some aging potential. According to wine expert Matt Kramer, well made examples from favorable vintages can be inky-black with [...] "fjord-like depth of fruit" [...] and soft, sweet tannins that are never <b>astringent,</b> unless the <b>wine</b> extracted too many tannins from prolong exposure to oak. Jancis Robinson notes that some examples of Montepulciano can exhibit a reductive character likely due to {{the high levels of}} phenolics in the grape variety.|$|R
2500|$|The {{astringency}} {{associated with}} wine is usually {{derived from a}} wine's tannins. Tannins add a gritty texture and chalky, astringent taste. It can enhance the perception of [...] "body" [...] or weight in the wine. Tannins are normally derived from the skins, seeds, and stems of the grapes themselves (leeched out during the maceration process) or from contact with oak during barrel aging. Tannins react with proteins. When paired with dishes that are high in proteins and fats (such as red meat and hard cheeses), the tannins will bind to the proteins and come across as softer. In the absence of protein from the food, such as some vegetarian dishes, the tannins will react with the proteins on the tongue and sides of the mouth‚Äîaccentuating the astringency and having a drying effect on the palate. Various cooking methods, such as grilling and blackening can add a bitter [...] "char" [...] component to the dish that will allow it to play well with a tannic wine. While fish oils can make tannic wines taste metallic or off. <b>Astringent</b> tannic <b>wines</b> like Barolo and Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm a lot of foods but can be soften by fatty foods {{with a lot of}} proteins such as hard cheeses or meats. The dry tannins also serve as a cleansing agent on the palate by binding to the grease and oils left over in the mouth. Spicy and sweet foods can accentuate the dry, bitterness of tannins and make the wine seem to have off flavors.|$|R
