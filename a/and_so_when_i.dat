2500|$|Edith Grossman, {{who wrote}} and {{published}} a highly acclaimed English {{translation of the}} novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, {{on the verge of}} both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:The question is that Quixote has multiple interpretations [...] and how do I deal with that in my translation. I'm going to answer your question by avoiding it [...] so when I first started reading the Quixote I thought it was the most tragic book in the world, and I would read it and weep [...] As I grew older [...] my skin grew thicker [...] <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was working on the translation I was actually sitting at my computer and laughing out loud. This is done [...] as Cervantes did it [...] by never letting the reader rest. You are never certain that you truly got it. Because as soon as you think you understand something, Cervantes introduces something that contradicts your premise.|$|E
60|$|I was silent, but I did {{not accept}} the explanation. <b>And</b> <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had the chance, I asked old man Sellers, who browsed daily on my exchanges.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{will take}} {{advantage}} of my absence," [...] said he, [...] "and invade my dominions, <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> return, I shall find that I have been robbed of half my provinces." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nene: [...] "Why be <b>so</b> nasty <b>and</b> <b>so</b> rude <b>when</b> <b>I</b> can be <b>so</b> fierce <b>and</b> <b>so</b> successful." ...|$|R
60|$|I was at {{the edge}} of the upper wood, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> now, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> halted <b>and</b> looked back, I saw all the open part of the hill below me.|$|R
5|$|You {{were scared}} <b>and</b> <b>so</b> was <b>I</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> gave myself to you...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I've been {{hungry and}} cold, but I always looked after my horse, <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> struck a cow country I could whirl in and earn some money. It don't {{take much to}} keep me when I'm on the trail." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dusky {{shook his}} head. [...] "No," [...] said he, [...] "but I learned {{long ago that}} where there is one terrible gun there {{is likely to be}} more, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard that one bang, I led my flock away from here in a hurry. We didn't want to take any chances." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{called up}} my groom; {{he made the}} rascal put on all my clothes, and, giving him a guinea and four cigars, bade him lock himself into the little pantry and smoke them WITHOUT TAKING THE CLOTHES OFF. John did so, and was very ill in consequence, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came to B---- House, my clothes were redolent of tobacco, and I lost lovely Mary M'Alister.|$|E
60|$|On my map I would {{register}} so many paces south, so many east, <b>so</b> many west, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> on. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> {{was ready}} to return I would then do so by any route that I might choose.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Canning did {{not come}} to {{business}} until very late, as he lived twenty-five miles out of the city, in New Jersey. There were no clerks but Gus <b>and</b> myself; <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> arrived at the office I found Mr. Stillwell still alone.|$|R
60|$|Of course I regard {{your time}} as valuable, <b>and</b> {{consider}} it <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{ask you if}} you could devote any of it to this purpose.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's because I thought Macinnery was chiefly {{to blame}} that I sent him back alone. I {{determined}} {{to give you}} another chance. It struck me that the feeling of authority might have some influence on you, <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had to build a boma to guard the road down to the coast, I put the chief part of the stores in your care and left you in command. I need not remind you what happened there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed! Then I owe {{him another}} debt of gratitude--in fact, {{he told me}} that one of his flock, meaning Biddy, had spoken to him honourably of me. [...] "Well," [...] said I, [...] "the {{greatest}} service you could do me, sir, would be to introduce me to Mademoiselle Belmarche; I have a young lady's commission for her." [...] "From my little Genevieve," [...] he said, [...] "the darling that she is. Did you leave the child well?" [...] <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> said it was a present for her saint's day, and that your heart was set on it--' ...|$|E
60|$|I don't wish to digscribe the marridge seminary--how the embasy chapling jined {{the hands}} of this loving young couple--how one of the embasy footmin {{was called in to}} witness the marridge--how Miss wep and fainted as usial--and how Deuceace carried her, fainting, to the brisky, and drove off to Fontingblo, where they were to pass the fust weak of the honey-moon. They took no servnts, because they wisht, they said, to be privit. <b>And</b> <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had shut up the steps, and bid the postilion drive on, I bid ajew to the Honrabble Algernon, and went off strait to his exlent father.|$|E
6000|$|I was sleepy <b>and</b> tired, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got to {{the hotel}} I hurriedly paid it the fifty cents it demanded (with {{approximate}} lagniappe, I assure you). I knew its habits; and I {{did not want to}} hear it prate about its old [...] "marster" [...] or anything that happened [...] "befo' de wah." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{the life}} at Nid de Merle was very peaceful. Just as exquisitely happy {{it was in}} spite of alarms, anxieties, perplexities, <b>and</b> discomforts, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{contemplate}} my three years in Anjou I {{see that they were}} full of peace, though the sunshine of my life was over and Cecile had never come.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can hear}} a bell that's ringing; [...] I can feel some people's singing; [...] But a {{mountain}} isn't sensible of what goes on, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> [...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> hear a blizzard blowing [...] Or it's raining hard, or snowing, [...] I tell it to the mountain and the mountain seems to know.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{what they}} said," [...] Alderling crowed. [...] "And Marion has {{always thought that}} if she had {{believed}} that way, she could have kept me up to it; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> died I should have lived again. It is perfectly logical, though it isn't capable of a practical demonstration. If Marion had come of a believing family, she could have brought me back into the fold. Her great mistake was in being brought up by an uncle who denied that he was living here, even. The poor girl could not do a thing {{when it came to the}} life hereafter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lord, captain Willoughby, I was {{altogether}} dumbfounded, {{when the}} truth came upon me of a sudden! I {{never should have}} known the major in that dress, in the world, {{or out of the}} world either; but he walks so like the captain, that as I followed a'ter him, I said to myself, who can it be?--and then the walk came over me, as it might be; and then I remembered last night, and the stranger that was out with the captain, and how he occupied the room next to the library, and them things; <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come to look in his face, there was the major sure enough!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See, auntie, all nice scarlet flannel, and a gay little petticoat, {{and long}} stockings, oh, so warm! Phebe and I nearly died {{laughing}} when I put this rig on, but I like it ever so much. The dress is so comfortable, and doesn't need any belt or sash, and I can sit without rumpling any trimming, that's such a comfort! I {{like to be}} tidy, <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wear fussed-up things, I'm thinking of my clothes all the time, and that's tiresome. Do say you like it. I resolved I would, just to please uncle, for he does know more about health than anyone else, I'm sure, and I'd wear a bag if {{he asked me to}} do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{you liked}} him, {{and he is}} not really nice, Nuttie. Mark knows all about him; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> did <b>I</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> lived with the Delmars.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I pray {{you to say}} no {{more about}} it, mademoiselle. I deem it a most {{fortunate}} circumstance, that I was {{able to come to}} your assistance, <b>and</b> especially <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found that the lady I had rescued was one whose disappearance had made so great a stir; but I should have been glad to render such service to one in the poorest condition." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> 'twill be <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am gone [...] That tuneful peal {{will still}} ring on; [...] While other bards shall walk these dells, [...] And sing your praise, sweet evening bells.|$|R
6000|$|STEVE. 'It's a come down. Ass, ass, ass! But I say, Alice, I'm awfully glad it's I {{who have}} been the ass and not you. I really am, Colonel. You see the tragedy of my life is I'm such an {{extraordinarily}} ordinary sort of fellow that, though every man I know says some lady has loved him, there never in all my unromantic life {{was a woman who}} cared a Christmas card for me. It often makes me lonely; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> thought such a glorious woman as you, Alice--I lost touch of earth altogether; but now I've fallen back on it with a whack. But I'm glad--yes, I'm glad. You two kindest people Steve Rollo has ever known.--Oh, I say good-night. I suppose you can't overlook it, Alice.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, sir, {{you never}} {{let me know that}} you were going to leave, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found that you did not come back, I made bold to speak to Mr. Arnelm when he came home from hunting; but I could not get enough breath out of him to stop a {{ladybird}} on a rose-leaf. I did not much like it, your honour, for I was among strangers, and so were you, you know. Well, then, I went to Master Rodolph: he was very kind to me, and seeing me in low spirits, and thinking me, I suppose, in love, or in debt, or that I had done some piece of mischief, or had something or other preying on my mind, he comes to me, and says, 'Essper,' said he; you remember Master Rodolph's voice, sir?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have already}} {{observed}} how I brought all my goods into this pale, {{and into the}} cave which I had made behind me: but I must observe too that at first this was a confused heap of goods, which as they lay in no order, so they took up all my place: I had no room to turn myself; so I set myself to enlarge my cave, and work farther into the earth; for it was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed on it: <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the right hand into the rock; and then, turning to the right again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out, {{on the outside of}} my pale or fortification.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes indeed; all the 'patter,' {{and some}} of the guile. For instance, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> want to use 'those who have passed on' <b>I</b> do <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> don't I invent means to deceive them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait!" [...] {{said the}} ape-man to his captive. [...] "This gentleman wishes you, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> do <b>I.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> am through with you, {{he may have}} you. Tell me what has become of my wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I can't sing to-day, Fritz. I am very unhappy about mamma. She looks <b>so</b> anxious <b>and</b> <b>so</b> ill; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> ask what is troubling her, she puts me {{off with an}} excuse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But the jemadar {{laughed at}} me. 'I tell you,' he said, 'this {{rebellion}} is all child's play. For I have myself been {{across the water}} once, as an officer's servant, and have been to England, and to their great town, London. It {{is so great that}} a man can hardly walk across it from end to end in a day; and if you were to put Allahabad or Cawnpore down in its midst, the people would not know that any new thing had come about. They have ships in their rivers as thick as the canes in a sugar-field; and iron roads with cars drawn by steam horses. They have so many men that they could overrun all India as easily as the people of Cawnpore could overrun Bihtoor. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> hear their guns outside the town, I will run away to them, and I advise you to do so too.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have already}} {{observed}} how I brought all my goods into this pale, {{and into the}} cave which I had made behind me.

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it was a back way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to store my goods.|$|E
6000|$|... "There was a morbid {{sensitiveness}} and acuteness {{of feeling}} in me on all possible subjects, {{of which he}} {{and my father had}} no kind of understanding, and with which they could have no possible sympathy. But mother did; <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had quarreled with Alfred, and father looked sternly on me, I used to go off to mother's room, and sit by her. I remember just how she used to look, with her pale cheeks, her deep, soft, serious eyes, her white dress,--she always wore white; and I used to think of her whenever I read in Revelations about the saints that were arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. She {{had a great deal of}} genius of one sort and another, particularly in music; and she used to sit at her organ, playing fine old majestic music of the Catholic church, and singing with a voice more like an angel than a mortal woman; and I would lay my head down on her lap, and cry, and dream, and feel,--oh, immeasurably!--things that I had no language to say! ...|$|E
60|$|Dear old Freddie, don't you know, {{has been}} a dear old pal of mine for years <b>and</b> years; <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> went into the club one morning and found him sitting alone in a dark corner, staring glassily at nothing, and {{generally}} looking like the last rose of summer, you can understand I was quite disturbed about it. As a rule, the old rotter is the life and soul of our set. Quite the little lump of fun, and {{all that sort of}} thing.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Eli {{rose and}} {{stood with his}} back to the fire. [...] "I didn't think of that," [...] he said, [...] "but <b>I</b> guess it's <b>so.</b> <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come to think of it, a Christmas isn't much of a Christmas, anyway, without children." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was thrilled}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{received}} the call {{the second time}} to feature in The Perfect Picture. I had no idea I was going to act alongside big names in movies like Chris Attoh, Jackie Appiah <b>and</b> Adjetey Anang <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was given the script I gave it my best shot. It was quite challenging" [...] she revealed.|$|R
