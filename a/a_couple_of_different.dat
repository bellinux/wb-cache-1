500|$|Dr.Dre {{has said}} that his primary {{instrument}} in the studio is the Akai MPC3000, a drum machine and sampler, and that he often uses {{as many as four}} or five to produce a single recording. He cites 1970s funk musicians such as George Clinton, Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield as his primary musical influences. Unlike most rap producers, he tries to avoid samples as much as possible, preferring to have studio musicians re-play pieces of music he wants to use, because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo. In 2001 he told Time magazine, [...] "I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but I'd rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it. I can control it better." [...] Other equipment he uses include the E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and other keyboards from such manufacturers as Korg, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Moog, and Roland. Dr. Dre also stresses the importance of equalizing drums properly, telling Scratch magazine in 2004 that he [...] "used the same drum sounds on <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> songs on one album before but you'd never {{be able to tell the}} difference because of the EQ."

500|$|Population {{frequencies}} of common APOA5 alleles exhibit large interethnic differences. For example, {{there are about}} 15% of carriers of the -1131C allele among Caucasians, but the frequency could reach even between 40% and 50% among Asians. In contrast, the Trp19 allele is very rare in the Asian population (less than 1% of carriers) but is common in Caucasians (about 15% of carriers). Vice versa, important SNP (rs2075291, G553T, Gly185˃Cys) with a population frequency of about 5% has been detected among Asians, but it is extremely rare among Caucasians. Sporadic publications refer to some other common polymorphisms, e.g. Val153˃Met (rs3135507, G457A) and also suggest significant sex-dependent associations with plasma lipids. [...] Rare variants within the APOA5 gene have been described in <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> populations.

Originally detected in patients with extreme TG levels over 10 mmo/L, it was also found in about 0.7% of the general population (mostly in individuals with normal TG values), which suggests a low penetrance of this variant. More than twenty other rare variants (mutations) have been described within the human APOA5 gene. They cover a wide spectrum that includes preliminary stop codons, amino acid changes as well as insertions and deletions. These mutations are generally associated with hypertriglyceridaemia, but penetration is usually not 100%. Individual mutations have been found mostly in one pedigree only.|$|E

500|$|However, as is {{most often}} the case with film adaptations, {{differences}} do exist between the film and source material. Certain scenes from the book were cut from the film, such as a biology room scene where Bella's class does blood typing. Hardwicke explains, [...] "Well [...] almost 500 pages—you do have to do the sweetened condensed milk version of that.... We already have two scenes in biology: the first time they're in there and then the second time when they connect. For a film, when you condense, you don't want to keep going back to the same setting over and over. So that's not in there." [...] The settings of certain conversations in the book were also changed to make the scenes more [...] "visually dynamic" [...] on-screen, such as Bella's revelation that she knows Edward is a vampire—this happens in a meadow in the film instead of in Edward's car as in the novel. A biology field trip scene is added to the film to condense the moments of Bella's frustration at trying to explain how Edward saved her from being crushed by a van. The villainous vampires are introduced earlier in the film than in the novel. Rosenberg said that [...] "you don't really see James and the other villains until to {{the last quarter of the}} book, which really won't work for a movie. You need that ominous tension right off the bat. We needed to see them and that impending danger from the start. And so I had to create back story for them, what they were up to, to flesh them out a bit as characters." [...] Rosenberg also combined some of the human high school students, with Lauren Mallory and Jessica Stanley in the novel becoming the character of Jessica in the film, and a [...] "compilation of <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> human characters" [...] becoming Eric Yorkie. About these variances from the book, Mooradian stated, [...] "I think we did a really judicious job of distilling [...] Our greatest critic, Stephenie Meyer, loves the screenplay, and that tells me that we made all the right choices in terms of what to keep and what to lose.

40|$|The full point group {{symmetry}} of a crystal {{can be broken}} due to internal or external effective fields. In the study of excitons, such symmetry breaking can lead to <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> exciton states and if a system is prepared in an exciton state with a defined total angular momentum (pseudospin), spin beating is obtained. Looking at the fluctuations of these fields, we use the invariant expansion of an effective Hamiltonian to investigate exciton-spin-relaxation dynamics in a model two-band bulk semiconductor and discuss the respective importance <b>of</b> the <b>different</b> spin-flip processes. We find that interaction terms leading to an electron or hole spin flip {{give rise to a}} pure transverse dephasing. Terms where the electron and hole spins are simultaneously reversed lead to transitions between the spin states, which are characterized by the longitudinal relaxation time. Similar to motional narrowing in the case of free carriers, the latter process can lead to an increase in the exciton-spin-relaxation times if extrinsic electric, magnetic, or strain fields rapidly fluctuate in the sample. This effect is shown to be due to the electron-hole exchange interaction...|$|R
