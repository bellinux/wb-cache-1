25|$|Anaximander was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to consider the Sun as a huge mass, and consequently, to realize how far from Earth it might be, {{and the first to}} present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances. Furthermore, according to Diogenes Laertius (II, 2), he built a celestial sphere. This invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the obliquity of the Zodiac as the Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder reports in Natural History (II, 8). It is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>early</b> to use the term ecliptic, but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the Earth to explain the seasons. The doxographer and theologian Aetius attributes to Pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, {{the time}} of day or night in Paris was largely {{announced}} by the church bells; in 1789 there were 66 churches, 92 chapels, 13 abbeys and 199 convents, all of which rang their bells for regular services and prayers; sometimes <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>early,</b> sometimes a little late. A clock had also been installed in a tower of the palace on the Île de la Cité by Charles V in about 1370, and it also sounded the hour. Wealthy and noble Parisians began to have pocket watches, and needed a way to accurately set the time, so sundials appeared around the city. The best known-sundial was in the courtyard of the Palais-Royal. In 1750, the Duke of Chartres had a cannon installed there which, following the sundial, was fired precisely at noon each day.|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>early</b> to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose. We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We talk a lot about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>early</b> ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E

2500|$|Skinner {{advocated}} {{the use of}} teaching machines for {{a broad range of}} students (e.g., preschool aged to adult) and instructional purposes (e.g., reading and music). For example, one machine that he envisioned could teach rhythm. He wrote:A relatively simple device supplies the necessary contingencies. The student taps a rhythmic pattern in unison with the device. [...] "Unison" [...] is specified very loosely at first (the student can be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>early</b> or late at each tap) but the specifications are slowly sharpened. The process is repeated for various speeds and patterns. In another arrangement, the student echoes rhythmic patterns sounded by the machine, though not in unison, and again the specifications for an accurate reproduction are progressively sharpened. Rhythmic patterns can also be brought under the control of a printed score.The instructional potential of the teaching machine stemmed from several factors: it provided automatic, immediate and regular reinforcement without the use of aversive control; the material presented was coherent, yet varied and novel; the pace of learning could be adjusted to suit the individual. As a result, students were interested, attentive, and learned efficiently by producing the desired behavior, [...] "learning by doing." ...|$|E
