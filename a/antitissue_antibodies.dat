40|$|Much of our {{information}} and prejudice regarding {{the action of}} host nutoanfibodies to tissue-fixed antigens is based on experience with heterologons <b>antitissue</b> <b>antibodies,</b> particularly antikidney antibodies. The interaction of heterologous antikidney antibodies with the renal antigens, largely in the glomerular capillary walls, and with antigens of other vascular tissues such as lung, adrenal, and placenta {{has been the subject}} of numerous reports (1 [...] 4). The rapid clearance of these antibodies from the circulation and their fixation to tissues has been determined (5 - 7). The pathologic consequences of this antigen-antibody reaction and some of the mediators of the injury are also recognized (8, 9). However, whether some autologons <b>antitissue</b> <b>antibodies</b> might have capabilities for inducing tissue injury similar to those of heterologous antibodies is still not certain. Since quantitative studies of autoantibodies are virtually impossible beeanse of ever present antigens capable of removing antibody from the circulation, critical observations on the autoantibody-tissue antigen interaction are difficult.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of celiac disease among blood donor volunteers based on screening by IgA <b>antitissue</b> transglutaminase <b>antibody,</b> followed by a confirmatory small intestine biopsy. Methods: the transversal study involved 3000 potential blood donors, residing {{in the city of}} São Paulo, Brazil. the participants were gender divided into 1500 men and 1500 women, with an average age 34. 4 +/- 10. 8 years, and included blood donor volunteers who could be turned down owing to anemia. All participants answered a questionnaire concerning the presence of diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain during the 3 months before the study. Each participant with human recombinant IgA <b>antitissue</b> transglutaminase <b>antibody</b> level above 10 U/ml was invited to undergo a small intestine biopsy by means of an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. the presence of villous atrophy and a positive antibody test were suggestive of possible celiac disease. Results: <b>Antitissue</b> transglutaminase <b>antibody</b> was positive in 1. 5 % (45 / 3000) of the study population. Among the anti body-positive group, 21 (46. 6 %) agreed to have a biopsy performed, and within them the histological pattern of villous atrophy was confirmed in 66. 7 % (14 / 21). Consequently, the suggestive prevalence of celiac disease was at the minimum, one per 214 of the potential blood donor volunteers. A significant association was found between celiac disease and the symptoms of diarrhea, constipation and abdominal pain. Conclusions: {{the prevalence of}} celiac disease in São Paulo city is high and comparable to that observed in European countries.

Objective: To summarize evidence {{on the performance of}} diagnostic tests for identifying celiac disease in adults presenting with abdominal symptoms in primary care or similar settings. Data Sources: A literature search via MEDLINE (beginning in January 1966) and EMBASE (beginning in January 1947) through December 2009 and a manual search of references for additional relevant studies. Study Selection: Diagnostic studies were selected if they had a cohort or nested case-control design, enrolled adults presenting with nonacute abdominal symptoms, the prevalence of celiac disease was 15 % or less, and the tests used included gastrointestinal symptoms or serum antibody tests. Data Extraction: Quality assessment using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool and data extraction were performed by 2 reviewers independently. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated for each study and pooled estimates were computed using bivariate analysis if there was clinical and statistical homogeneity. Data Synthesis: Sixteen studies were included in the review (N= 6085 patients). The performance of abdominal symptoms varied widely. The sensitivity of diarrhea, for example, ranged from 0. 27 to 0. 86 and specificity from 0. 21 to 0. 86. Pooled estimates for IgA antiendomysial antibodies (8 studies) were 0. 90 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 80 - 0. 95) for sensitivity and 0. 99 (95 % CI, 0. 98 - 1. 00) for specificity (positive likelihood ratio [LR] of 171 and negative LR of 0. 11). Pooled estimates for IgA <b>antitissue</b> transglutaminase <b>antibodies</b> (7 studies) were 0. 89 (95 % CI, 0. 82 - 0. 94) and 0. 98 (95 % CI, 0. 95 - 0. 99), respectively (positive LR of 37. 7 and negative LR of 0. 11).

40|$|Celiac {{disease is}} a {{permanent}} intolerance to dietary gluten. Its well known features are abdominal symptoms, malabsorption of nutrients, and small-bowel mucosal inflammation with villous atrophy, which recover on a gluten-free diet. Diagnosis is challenging in that patients often suffer from subtle, if any, symptoms. The risk of clinically silent celiac disease is increased in various autoimmune conditions. The endocrinologist, especially, should maintain high suspicion and alertness to celiac disease, {{which is to be}} found in 2 – 5 % of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or autoimmune thyroid disease. Patients with multiple endocrine disorders, Addison’s disease, alopecia, or hypophysitis may also have concomitant celiac disease. Similar heredity and proneness to autoimmune conditions are considered to be explanations for these associations. A gluten-free diet is essential to prevent celiac complications such as anemia, osteoporosis, and infertility. The diet may also be beneficial in the treatment of the underlying endocrinological disease; prolonged gluten exposure may even contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases. The diagnosis of celiac disease requires endoscopic biopsy, but serological screening with antiendomysial and <b>antitissue</b> transglutaminase <b>antibody</b> assays is an easy method for preliminary case finding. Celiac disease will be increasingly detected provided the close association with autoimmune endocrinological diseases is recognized. (Endocrine Reviews 23 : 464 – 483, 2002...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: One of the coeliac disease(CD) {{symptoms}} is infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, {{we are not}} {{cognizant of}} any CD reports in pregnancy in Iran. Therefore, this study aims to prospectively estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed CD in a population of pregnant {{women as well as}} its complications in pregnancy. Methods: 796 pregnant women with mean age of 26 years(SD= 26) and mean pregnancy duration of 5. 4 months participated in this descriptive study from 2007 to 2008. Total IgA test and <b>antitissue</b> transglutaminase(tTGA) <b>antibodies</b> were measured. Those with positive TGA underwent histological biopsy specimens according to modified Marsh classification. Results: A positive CD serology for tTGA was obderved in 17 (2. 1 %) out of 796 pregnant women. Out of the 17 seropositive patients, 10 had abnormal histology compatible with CD(Marsh I-IIIc) symptoms. Two pregnant women had already experienced miscarriage. Moreover, 3 patients had born low birth weight babies. Conclusion: In this study, there was no significant relationship between CD and high incidence of adverse outcomes. Overall, 1 out of 66 pregnant women(1. 5 % rate of prevalence) suffered from CD. Celiac disease shows different severity in different individuals.

Patients referred to two outpatient gastroenterology clinics in Isfahan (IRAN) were categorized into those with typical or atypical symptoms of CD. IgA <b>antitissue</b> transglutaminase <b>antibody</b> was assessed and followed by duodenal biopsy. In patients for whom endoscopy was indicated (independent of the serology), duodenal biopsy was taken. Histopathological changes were assessed according to the Marsh classification. Results. During the study period, 151 and 173 patients with typical and atypical symptoms were evaluated (mean age = 32. 8 ± 12. 6 and 35. 8 ± 14. 8 years, 47. 0 % and 56. 0 % female, resp.). Frequency of CD in patients with typical and atypical symptoms was calculated, respectively, as 5. 9 % (9 / 151) and 1. 25 % (3 / 173) based on positive serology and pathology. The overall frequency was estimated as at least 9. 2 % (14 / 151) and 4. 0 % (7 / 173) when data of seronegative patients were also considered. Conclusions.

40|$|Objective. The {{prevalence}} of Celiac Disease (CD) {{is high in}} Iran, and evaluation of CD {{is not part of}} the routine screening procedure for dyspeptic patients; therefore, cases of occult CD may be missed. This study aimed to investigate the {{prevalence of}} occult CD among dyspeptic patients who presented at a gastroenterology clinic in the Western region of Iran. Methods. In this descriptive, cross-sectional prospective study, patients who had a history of at least 12 weeks of upper abdominal discomfort were eligible to participate in the study during a 14 -month recruitment period. Patients with a clinical or paraclinical data in favor of organic causes were excluded from the study. Enrolled patients were screened for IgA antiendomysium antibody (EMA) and IgA <b>antitissue</b> transglutaminase <b>antibody</b> (tTG). Those who screened positive for EMA/tTG received a confirmatory diagnostic biopsy for Marsh classification of CD. Results. From 225 potential participants with dyspepsia, 55 patients were excluded due to having explainable organic causes. The study sample included 170 patients with “functional dyspepsia. ” Mean age of participants was 31 years and 55. 8 % were female. Twelve patients (7 %) had positive tests (EMA/tTG), of which 10 were female (83. 4 %).

40|$|The {{functional}} structure of gamma globulins and antibodies has recently come under intensive investigation {{through the use}} of reduction and alkylation of disulfide bonds (1). This method has revealed the great similarity in fundamental polypeptide chain structure among many species as well as between the different classes of immunoglobulins (2). By contrast, reduction of disulfide bonds affects immunological properties of different antibodies to varying degrees.

40|$|Up-regulation {{of tissue}} factor {{activity}} on human proximal tubular epithelial cells {{in response to}} Shiga toxin. BackgroundThe pathophysiology of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is incompletely established. Based on clinical studies demonstrating the presence of prothrombotic plasma markers in patients with HUS, we hypothesized that Shiga toxin might cause activation of the coagulation pathway by augmenting tissue factor, the major initiator of coagulation. MethodsHuman proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) [human kidney- 2 (HK- 2 cells) ] were exposed to Shiga toxin- 1, and expression of tissue factor, cell detachment, protein synthesis, caspase- 3 activity, and Shiga toxin- 1 binding were examined. ResultsHK- 2 cells expressed constitutive surface tissue factor activity and increased their tissue factor expression upon exposure to Shiga toxin- 1. Shiga toxin- 1 bound to HK- 2 cells and inhibited protein synthesis. The up-regulation of tissue factor was dose- and time-dependent and strongly correlated with cell detachment and increase in caspase- 3 activity caused by Shiga toxin- 1 exposure. A general caspase inhibitor simultaneously inhibited HK- 2 cell detachment and tissue factor up-regulation while mutant Shiga toxin- 1 neither caused cell detachment, protein synthesis inhibition, nor increase in tissue factor activity. Tissue factor activity elicited by Shiga toxin- 1 was abrogated by a monoclonal <b>antitissue</b> factor <b>antibody.</b> Calphostin C, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, partially blocked tissue factor up-regulation, indicating possible involvement of PKC-dependent mechanism. ConclusionThese data, taken together, suggest a strong link between Shiga toxin–induced up-regulation of tissue factor activity, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis in HK- 2 cells. The proximal tubule is a target of Shiga toxin in HUS, and it seems plausible that injured proximal tubular cells trigger the activation of the coagulation system, the formation of intrarenal platelet-fibrin thrombi, {{and the development of}} acute renal failure in HUS...|$|R

Duodenal biopsy was not considered feasible by the ethics committee for pregnant women near delivery. Results: Fifty one of 5055 patients had confirmed positive results. We added to these 12 women with known coeliac disease, giving a prevalence rate for coeliac disease of 1 : 80 (exactly the value observed during the first study). Comparing the 51 TGASE positive with 4997 negative women, we did not observe an excess risk of abortion, premature delivery, small birth weight, or intrauterine growth retardation. Anaemia was more frequent in cases than controls. Conclusions: Undiagnosed coeliac disease is frequent among pregnant women (> 1 %) but is not associated with an unfavourable outcome of pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the value of}} serum <b>antitissue</b> transglutaminase IgA <b>antibodies</b> (IgA-TTG) and IgA antiendomysial antibodies (IgA-EMA) in the diagnosis of coeliac disease in cohorts from different geographical areas in Europe. The setting allowed a further comparison between the antibody results and the conventional small-intestinal histology. METHODS: A total of 144 cases with coeliac disease [median age 19. 5 years (range 0. 9 - 81. 4) ], and 127 disease controls [median age 29. 2 years (range 0. 5 - 79. 0) ], were recruited, {{on the basis of}} biopsy, from 13 centres in nine countries. All biopsy specimens were re-evaluated and classified blindly a second time by two investigators. IgA-TTG were determined by ELISA with human recombinant antigen and IgA-EMA by an immunofluorescence test with human umbilical cord as antigen. RESULTS: The quality of the biopsy specimens was not acceptable in 29 (10. 7 %) of 271 cases and a reliable judgement could not be made, mainly due to poor orientation of the samples. The primary clinical diagnosis and the second classification of the biopsy specimens were divergent in nine cases, and one patient was initially enrolled in the wrong group. Thus, 126 coeliac patients and 106 controls, verified by biopsy, remained for final analysis. The sensitivity of IgA-TTG was 94 % and IgA-EMA 89 %, the specificity was 99 % and 98 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Serum IgA-TTG measurement is effective and at least as good as IgA-EMA in the identification of coeliac disease. Due to a high percentage of poor histological specimens, the diagnosis of coeliac disease should not depend only on biopsy, but in addition the clinical picture and serology should be considered.
