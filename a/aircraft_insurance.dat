40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the <b>aircraft’s</b> <b>insurance</b> market, {{and more specifically}} the variables that affect the premium paid by the airlines. From {{the development of an}} econometric model, we aim to provide an understanding of the dependence of the price charged by insurance companies with the parameters set by them for risk analysis of each airline. The results show that the unit cost of <b>insurance</b> <b>aircraft</b> per hour is well correlated with the exchange rate, ie the higher the exchange rate, the higher the cost of insurance, in addition, the size of the company was also relevant in the amount paid by safe, that is, the smaller the company, the largest aviation insurance expenditures. Finally after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 one sees an increase in unit cost of <b>insurance</b> <b>aircraft</b> per hour...|$|R

NTSB officials will routinely seize portions of wrecked aircraft for further analysis. Most of the time, after their study is complete, the sequestered debris is returned to the owners' representation - most often the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>insurance</b> company. However, examples like the reconstructed wreckage of TWA Flight 800 are held in perpetuity by the NTSB to education the public and future investigators on the NTSB's role in transportation safety.|$|R

50|$|After the war, Chambers, {{along with}} Rickenbacker, founded Florida Airways, which in 1926 {{received}} the first private airmail contract awarded by the U.S. Government. After the airline's uninsured aircraft suffered {{a series of}} accidents and damage caused by hurricanes, the airline declared bankruptcy in 1927. As {{a result of this}} loss, Chambers teamed with David Beebe and the two founded the United States <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Insurance</b> Group, the nation's first aviation insurance company. The security provided by this company ensured the development and testing of such pioneering aircraft as the Douglas DC-3, the Boeing 707, the B-52 jet bomber, and the General Dynamics F-111A.|$|E
40|$|The paper aims {{to analyze}} the Romanian {{insurance}} market in 2011 {{from the perspective of}} gross written premiums on non-life insurance classes, using principal component analysis technique (PCA) and cluster analysis in order to classify the 30 insurance companies by the most important components obtained by PCA. The empirical results showed that <b>aircraft</b> liability <b>insurance,</b> accident and sickness insurance, liability insurance for ships, insurance of legal expenses and the general liability insurance and surety ship insurance explain best the evolution of the insurance market. Grouping companies after the first two principal components, <b>aircraft</b> liability <b>insurance,</b> accident and sickness insurance, which recovers about 53 % of the total variance of the original variables, can highlight three classes of companies: Astra, Allianz-Tiriac and Omniasig. The cluster analysis indicates the existence of four classes of companies: City Insurance, Astra, Groupama Insurances and the rest...|$|R

40|$|The {{insurance}} industry is underdeveloped in most developing countries {{because of low}} levels of income and wealth and because restrictive regulations inhibit the supply of insurance services. But several countries have begun to reform their insurance industries. To help those countries, the authors offer an overview of insurance regulation in the United States - and discuss the economics and market structure of nonlife insurance in entry and exit barriers, economies of scale, and conduct and performance studies. They conclude that the U. S. nonlife {{insurance industry}} exhibits low concentration at both national and state market levels. Concentration is low even on a line-by-line basis. The primary concern of regulators has been to protect policyholders from insolvency, but regulation has also often been used to protect the market position of local insurance companies against the entry of out-of-state competitors. Regulation has worked best when based on solvency monitoring, with limited restrictions on entry. It has been more harmful when it involved controls on premiums and products and on the industry's level of profitability. Over the years the industry has shown a remarkable degree of innovation, although it has also faced many serious and persistent problems. The problems include the widespread crisis in liability (including product liability and medical malpractice), the crisis in automobile insurance, the volatility of investment income, the effects of market-driven pricing and underwriting cycles, {{and the difficulty of}} measuring insurance solvency. The long-tailed lines of insurance - those that entail long delays in final settlements - are exposed to the vagaries of inflation and rising costs. Two mandatory lines - third party automobile insurance and workers'compensation (for work accidents) - account for nearly 55 percent of premiums. These two lines - plus medical malpractice, other liability, and <b>aircraft</b> <b>insurance</b> - had combined ratios well over 125 percent in 1989. The industry has some ability to collude and to set prices, but seems to be competitive and to earn profits below similarly situated financial firms. Insurance profitability is not consistently above or below normal returns, although earnings for mandatory and strictly regulated lines of automobile insurance and workers'compensation appear to be below-adequate for long-term viability.

50|$|Civil {{aviation}} authorities, {{and model}} <b>aircraft</b> association <b>insurance</b> rules, restrict operations of radio-controlled aircraft, including multicopter-carrying cameras, to {{line of sight}} (LOS) operation. For all practical purposes, the range of operation of a multicopter, carrying a camera, {{is limited to a}} few hundred meters from the operator who is holding the radio control unit. The operational range of the most common, electric-powered multicopters are well-below the operational altitude and range of commercial aircraft, which are capable of conventional aerial photography using a larger, professional cameras that are hand-held by a camera operator, or, mounted inside a gyro-stabilized platform, which are mounted {{on the outside of the}} aircraft.|$|R

50|$|This {{coverage}} {{is similar to}} ground risk hull insurance not in motion, but provides coverage while the aircraft is taxiing, but not while taking off or landing. Normally, coverage ceases {{at the start of}} the take-off roll and is in force only once the aircraft has completed its subsequent landing. Due to disputes between <b>aircraft</b> owners and <b>insurance</b> companies about whether the accident aircraft was taxiing or attempting to take-off, this type of coverage has been discontinued by many insurance companies.|$|R

The scope of the research involves the obligation of the airlines company, <b>aircraft</b> producer, and <b>insurance</b> company in settling the indemnification to passengers who die, are injured, or disabled due to flight accident in Indonesia using liability theory. This research uses normative law method with qualitative approach which is explanatory and evaluative in form to find the {{solution to a problem}} by applying descriptive analysis. The result of the research concludes that, first, the indemnification to the passengers who die, are injured, or disabled due to flight accident is based on the principles of absolute liability.

5000|$|USSIC Aviation writes General Aviation and Special Risk {{insurance}}. The General Aviation insurance provides insurance through {{brokers and}} agents and represents {{a portfolio of}} commercial operations insurance including charter, cargo, aerial photography and many other [...] "for hire purposes" [...] aviation insurance. It provides coverage for commercial aircraft as well as private aircraft {{owned and operated by}} individuals. It offers coverage for rotor wing aircraft flown both for private and commercial purposes. In addition to hull and liability, General Aviation issues policies for airports which includes overages for premises, non-critical products, completed operations and hangar-keeper's legal liability. The Special Risks insurance offers coverage for aircraft that do not fit the typical definition of general aviation. These aircraft include antiques, classics, seaplanes, experimental aircraft, and warbirds. Pilots who wish to transition to more complex <b>aircraft</b> can obtain <b>insurance</b> through Special Risks. USSIC Aviation is a market leader for air show liability, insuring a majority of the nation's air shows each year. USSIC Aviation is the largest insurer of war-birds (that is, propeller and jet driven military surplus aircraft owned individually or held by aircraft museums). These aircraft are unique - often one of a kind - and obtaining the right insurance can be challenging. USSIC Aviation partners with aircraft owners and pilots to provide the coverage they need and to ensure the aircraft are operated and maintained in a safe manner.|$|R
