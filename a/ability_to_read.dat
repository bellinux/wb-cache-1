5|$|Australian openside David Pocock, who {{was also}} shortlisted for the IRB award, admires the way he reads the game {{as well as his}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the referee. One of McCaw's {{strengths}} is his ability to re-invent himself. For example, he adapted quickly to changes in the breakdown laws (e.g., the 2008 the Experimental Law Variations (ELVS) and the 2010 New IRB Law Interpretations) and, over time, other areas of his game.|$|E
5|$|Many top {{professional}} poker players {{got their}} start working in casinos. 1998 WSOP Main Event Champion and five time bracelet winner, Scotty Nguyen's first job {{was as a}} dealer.

50|$|Estimates {{show that}} {{approximately}} 15 to 20% of our nation's children have reading difficulties. These children have the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> {{but have a}} specific skill deficit that prevents them from accomplishing this important task. Research indicates that most reading disabled children have a deficiency in phonological processing skills. The IIP was designed to identify and remediate this deficit before it handicaps the child's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>read.</b>|$|R

5|$|Quackenbush was an {{offensive}} defenceman who carried the puck up the ice, {{making use of}} his stick handling, passing skills and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the play. Over {{the course of his}} career, he was considered one of the elite rushing defenceman in the NHL. He was a solid checker, but relied more on positioning and discipline than physical play. This is evident by his low yearly average of penalty minutes {{and the fact that he}} was assessed only one major penalty throughout his NHL career.|$|E
5|$|A young {{traveling}} Romani {{girl who}} Edward saves from being {{sold to the}} Thule Society. On the surface, she is proud of her heritage and lifestyle, but is unable to bear being discriminated for it. She has the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the minds of others, and becomes fascinated with Edward's world after witnessing his memories of it. Believing she wouldn't be discriminated in Edward's world, Noah assists the Thule Society in opening the Gate based on information from Edward's memories, but relents once Edward points out that his home is no utopia, and leaves Munich together with the Elric brothers. She is also similar in appearance to Rose, a character from the original anime.|$|E
5|$|Although Bax won a Macfarren Scholarship for {{composition}} {{and other important}} prizes, and {{was known for his}} exceptional <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> complex modern scores on sight, he attracted less recognition than his contemporaries Benjamin Dale and York Bowen. His keyboard technique was formidable, but he had no desire for a career as a soloist. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he had private means that made him free to pursue his musical career as he chose, without the necessity of earning an income. The Times considered that Bax's independence and disinclination to heed his teachers ultimately damaged his art, because he did not develop the discipline to express his imagination to the greatest effect.|$|E

5|$|In {{science as}} in everything, {{small-scale}} synthesizers usually get credit from all constituent parties, but truly great synthesizers can fall between {{the cracks in}} the cycle of scientific credit. Ledyard Stebbins was in the latter category; neither fish nor fowl, he frequently failed to receive credit for work in some areas, usually at the hands of narrower colleagues. Few, however, have challenged his contributions to plant evolutionary biology, nor questioned his ability to synthesize disparate literature into a coherent framework. His <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> quickly, recognize novel insights, digest new material, and then integrate the knowledge were the hallmarks of his scientific work style. He was a masterful synthesizer and master of the review essay or synthetic thought piece.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland {{underwent}} a Protestant Reformation that rejected Papal authority and {{many aspects of}} Catholic theology and practice. It created a predominately Calvinist national church, known as the kirk, which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook, severely reducing the powers of bishops, although not initially abolishing them. This gave considerable power within the new kirk to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy and would be important in establishing and funding schools. There was also a shift from emphasis on ritual to one on the word, making the Bible, and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the Bible, fundamental to Scottish religion.|$|E
5|$|The birth {{certificates}} and wills of Roman citizens {{had to be}} written in Latin until the time of Alexander Severus (reigned 222–235). Illiterate Roman subjects would have someone such as a government scribe (scriba) read or write their official documents for them. Laws and edicts were posted in writing as well as read out. Public art and religious ceremonies were ways to communicate imperial ideology regardless of language spoken or <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> An early form of story ballet (pantomimus) was brought to Rome by Greek performers and became popular throughout the multilingual Empire {{in part because it}} relied on gesture rather than verbal expression.|$|E

5|$|Widely {{regarded}} as Canada's greatest soccer player of all time, {{and as one}} of the greatest ever women soccer players, Sinclair is a fast, well-rounded, physically strong, and intelligent forward, known for her ball skills, athleticism, and technique. An accurate finisher, and a highly prolific goalscorer, she is a versatile and hard-working player, who is capable of playing both as a striker, and also as an advanced playmaker in midfield, due to her passing accuracy, <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the game, link-up with other midfielders, and create chances for teammates. Sinclair is also capable of scoring from free-kicks and penalties. In addition to her footballing abilities, she has stood out for her leadership and defensive work-rate throughout her career.|$|E
5|$|Damned to the Netherealm {{after her}} death, Mileena swears fealty to its ruler Shinnok. During {{the events of}} Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), Shao Kahn decides to resurrect Mileena so her skills as a vicious fighter would help him defeat Earth's chosen warriors, also magically {{granting}} her the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Kitana's thoughts. Shinnok sees {{this as an opportunity}} to covertly monitor the events unfolding in Earthrealm and so he allows her to return to life. After Kahn is defeated, Mileena is summoned back to the Netherealm. In Mortal Kombat Gold (1999), she assists in Shinnok's invasion of Edenia, but allows her sister to escape from a dungeon. Following Shinnok's defeat, Mileena comes to Kitana's palace and demands the power over Edenia be shared with her. Kitana refuses and, when attacked, traps Mileena and locks her away in a dungeon.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-first century AD, Christianity {{took root}} in Egypt {{and it was}} {{originally}} seen as another cult that could be accepted. However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from Egyptian Religion and Greco-Roman religion and threatened popular religious traditions. This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of Diocletian starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out. In 391 the Christian Emperor Theodosius introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples. Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed. As a consequence, Egypt's native religious culture was continually in decline. While the native population certainly continued to speak their language, the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> hieroglyphic writing slowly disappeared as {{the role of the}} Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.|$|E

These were spread roughly uniformly over the island: {{the largest number of}} speakers was in Douglas, with 566 people professing an <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> speak, <b>read</b> or write Manx. Peel had the second-largest number of speakers, with 179 people professing an <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> speak, <b>read</b> or write Manx.

5|$|Rodríguez {{featured}} in nine of ten World Cup qualifying matches for the Swiss, totaling 810 minutes, as they {{qualified for the}} World Cup with a game to spare, thanks to a 2–1 win over Albania on 11 October 2013. On 13 May 2014, Rodríguez was named in Switzerland's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In their opening group game against Ecuador on 15 June, he took the corner which was headed by Admir Mehmedi for the equaliser, as well as crossing for Haris Seferović to score the winner in a 2–1 victory. During the tournament finals in Brazil, he averaged 5 tackles and 2.5 interceptions per game, earning plaudits for his strong tackling {{as well as his}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the game.|$|E
5|$|Spending on Edward's {{personal}} household {{increased as}} he grew older, and in 1293 William of Blyborough took over as its administrator. Edward was probably given a religious education by the Dominican friars, whom his mother invited into his household in 1290. He was assigned one of his grandmother's followers, Guy Ferre, as his magister, {{who was responsible for}} his discipline, training him in riding and military skills. It is uncertain how well educated Edward was; there is little evidence for his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write, although his mother was keen that her other children were well educated, and Ferre was himself a relatively learned man for the period. Edward likely mainly spoke Anglo-Norman French in his daily life, in addition to some English and possibly Latin.|$|E
5|$|A complete, consistent, hardworking and {{versatile}} midfielder, Alonso {{is regarded as}} one of the best players of his generation, and is effective both creatively and defensively. Gifted with good technique, excellent vision, and varied passing range, he excels in the centre in a deep-lying playmaking role, where he can best use his accurate long passing ability to create goal scoring chances for teammates; he also possesses a powerful and accurate shot from distance, and he is an effective set-piece and penalty kick taker. Due to his height, positioning, and physical characteristics, Xabi Alonso is also effective in the air, often contributing with headed goals from set pieces when advancing into more offensive positions. In addition to his creative attributes, he is also capable of excelling as a defensive midfielder due to his strength and powerful physique, combined with his tenacity, tactical intelligence, aggressive tackling and his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the game. He has at times been criticised, however, for occasionally committing rash challenges and for his tendency to lose his composure and pick up unnecessary cards for particularly hard fouls.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to his field research on primates {{and the study of}} biomechanics, one of his research interests was the origin of language and writing, with investigation into communication amongst anthropoid apes. He {{was one of those who}} regarded facial expressions and gestures as a precursor of human writing skills. In brief, his thesis was that the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write are biologically older than those of language, because such visual communication was later supplemented by vocal and acoustic signals.|$|R

The research was conducted by working with a student one-on-one, using questionnaires, direct instruction, modeling expected behaviors, and allowing the student to complete tasks independently. The finding suggest that using strategies, such as predicting, help students not only {{gain a better understanding of}} what they are reading, but help build confidence in their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>read...</b>|$|R
5|$|Abra uses various extrasensory powers, {{even when}} sleeping. With the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> minds, they can sense danger, teleporting {{when it does}} and can do so quickly enough to create visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This {{behavior}} ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. These waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it evolves into Alakazam, it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become too heavy for its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. Able to remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has an IQ that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's mental abilities become even more pronounced due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam can engage in precognition, while all three Pokémon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected.|$|E
5|$|Although not gifted with pace, stamina, physicality or notable {{defensive}} skills, work-rate, or tackling abilities, Pirlo {{was known}} for his composure in possession, and drew praise for his touch, technique, balance, close control, and dribbling ability, as well as his flair and creativity in beating players with feints during one-on-one situations, in order to retain the ball and create space. As a playmaker, he is highly regarded by pundits for his outstanding vision, awareness, and football intelligence, as well as his movement, inventive play, anticipation, <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the game, and his wide range of distribution, which enabled him to play the ball first time and rarely relinquish possession, even when put under pressure; in addition to being capable of playing precise, short exchanges to teammates, he was also known for frequently attempting riskier and more difficult passes and is renowned in particular for his extremely accurate long-range passing, both on the ground or in the air, with either foot, despite being naturally right footed. He is considered {{to be one of the}} best passers in the history of the sport, and is also known for his accurate striking ability from distance. These characteristics allowed him to contribute to his team's offensive play with goals and assists.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years at Marseille, Nasri was {{deployed}} in several positions, most notably as a deep-lying midfielder and a wide midfielder primarily {{on the right side}} as he was deemed too small to play {{in the middle of the}} park. After two years of developing his physical traits, in the 2006–07 season, manager Albert Emon inserted Nasri into the playmaker role, where his vision, technical skill and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and understand the game suited him. Since that season, Nasri has been primarily deployed in the position or as a central attacking midfielder at both club and international level. The player has personally admitted that playing centrally is his preference. However, as a result of his versatility, Nasri can also function on the wing and spent the majority of his career at Arsenal occupying the role in the team's 4–3–3 formation. His close control with the ball, speed, dribbling, crossing, and ability to use both feet suits the position well, which has resulted in former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club. Nasri often featured centrally for Arsenal in the absence of former club captain Cesc Fàbregas.|$|E
50|$|The Gorgon is an {{extraordinary}} hand-to-hand combatant, even before his resurrection, trained in multiple forms of martial arts. He is an expert swordsman and typically prefers to use a katana during combat. Also, he typically uses his psionic <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the minds of his opponents during combat situations (even highly trained minds like Wolverine's and Elektra's), enabling him to predict and counter their every move. He has used swords and a personal teleportation device. He currently wields Godkiller, a sword that has killed many kings, emperors, and also made a god bleed.|$|R

However, as intelligent as she might have been, most of her intelligence was a result of past experiences and conflicts.
