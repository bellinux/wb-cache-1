500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Fascinated" [...] {{was released on}} October 25, 2011 via Nettwerk's official YouTube channel. The visual was directed by Schlesinger's close friend Adam Neustadter, who helped in creating a [...] "colorful" [...] and [...] "vaguely disorienting clip" [...] for the band. The video begins with Durand peering below a camera as flashing stills of a faceless man playing the keyboards appear. Three dancers, including a mime, a woman with sunglasses, and a ballerina, perform various choreography as the visual gradually zooms {{in and out of}} focus, achieving a 3D effect. As the first verse continues, Chase and Schlesinger are shown playing their respective instruments behind Durand, who sings the song's lyrics into a microphone. A similar process is carried out {{for the rest of the}} clip, and concludes by displaying the faceless individual using the keyboard. Commenting on the project's final result, Schlesinger insisted that it successfully matches the song's [...] "synth-pop vibe" [...] through the use of [...] "robot dancing, some vintage synths, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> with no face".|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{song and}} third single [...] "Break the Ice" [...] opens with Spears singing the lines [...] "It's {{been a while}} / I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting / But I'm here now".

Hilson explained the song is about [...] "two people, a girl <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy,</b> [...] and the girl is saying, 'You're a little cold. Let me warm things up and [...]'" [...] After the chorus, the bridge begins with Spears saying [...] "I like this part" [...] mimicking Janet Jackson in [...] "Nasty" [...] (1986). The album's fifth track, [...] "Heaven on Earth", is a Euro disco love song with new wave influences. It is inspired by Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love" [...] (1977), with three vocal lines taking place over the beat. Nicole Morier commented that the song was written from a very dark place, saying, [...] "I was thinking of someone and thinking they were so perfect and that I have all these imperfections. [...] I think what's touching {{about it is that}} it's from the perspective of someone who feels like they really need this person just to feel safe and feel good." [...] Spears named the song her favorite from Blackout. The sixth track, [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)" [...] is an uptempo R song about sex. It is a duet between Spears and Danja, who sings the chorus with his voice distorted to sound like a decaying moan. Spears contributes a series of gasps, sighs and chants and her voice is also distorted.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} years of its existence, prior to the opening of the fourth canal, {{navigation}} was only possible to {{the east side of the}} bridge. Electrical power to operate the bridge was supplied via an overhead cable from the west shore. [...] With the opening of the fourth canal, there was navigable water on both sides making an overhead wire impossible. [...] Since the bridge was designed to have the power fed from overhead and not beneath, an underwater cable was run from the shore to the more northerly concrete fender (which protected the ends of the bridge from ships when it swung). [...] A pole was erected on each [...] fender, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> wire run between them directly over the bridge. [...] The power cable was suspended from this guy wire to reach the top-hat-shaped device in the middle of the bridge which transferred the power to the rotating bridge. [...] This top-hat, and the two poles on the fenders, are still visible today. [...] This is a relatively unusual method of providing power to a swing bridge.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{idea for}} the film was conceived by Don Bluth after finishing work on The Secret of NIMH.

The character of a shaggy German Shepherd was designed specifically for Burt Reynolds. However, Bluth's first studio, Don Bluth Productions, {{was going through a}} period of financial difficulty, ultimately having to declare bankruptcy, and the idea never made it beyond rough storyboards. The concept was revived by Bluth, John Pomeroy, and Gary Goldman, and rewritten by David N. Weiss, collaborating with the producers from October through December 1987. They built around the title All Dogs Go to Heaven and drew inspiration from films, such as It's a Wonderful Life, Little Miss Marker, <b>and</b> <b>A</b> <b>Guy</b> Named Joe. The film's title came from a book read to Bluth's fourth-grade class, and he resisted suggestions to change it, stating he liked how [...] "provocative" [...] it sounded, and how people reacted to the title alone.|$|E

2500|$|When CNN {{presenter}} Jeff Greenfield {{was asked}} why Chomsky was never on his show, {{he claimed that}} Chomsky might [...] "be {{one of the leading}} intellectuals who can't talk on television.

Greenfield described this need to [...] "say things between two commercials" [...] as the media's requirement for [...] "concision". Chomsky has elaborated on this, saying that [...] "the beauty of [...] is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts. If you repeat conventional thoughts, you require zero evidence, like saying Osama Bin Laden is a bad guy, no evidence is required. However, if you say something that is true, although not a conventional truth, like the United States attacked South Vietnam, people are going to rightfully want evidence, {{and a whole lot of}} it, as they should. The format of the shows do not allow this type of evidence which is one of the reasons concision is critical." [...] He's continued that if the media were better propagandists they would invite dissidents to speak more often because the time restraint would stop them from properly explaining their radical views and they [...] "would sound like they were from Neptune." [...] For this reason, Chomsky rejects many offers to appear on TV, preferring the written medium.|$|E
2500|$|Although Bill and I {{performed}} {{at a very}} young age, and Bill, I, Barry and John did a lot of frat parties at Brown University and clubs in Newport ... the most memorable performance of what I would view as the precursor of what The Cowsills would be was at Kings Park in Newport (right at the foot of Halidon Hall) at some carnival.

2500|$|In {{the season}} 6 premiere, it is {{discovered}} that the person whom Lucas called is Peyton. She goes {{to the airport and}} they hop on a plane to Vegas to get married. Once they get there, the chapel is too trashy, and so they do not get married. Instead, they drive to L.A. and Lucas proposes to her in the same hotel room he did years before. The two are still in L.A. during Brooke's attack. After Brooke calls Peyton and sounds weird, Lucas and Peyton decide to head back to Tree Hill and have the wedding there instead. Peyton sees that Brooke is beaten up, but Brooke lies and says she fell down the stairs, and Peyton believes her, not knowing that Brooke was attacked. Peyton meets a famous musician named Mick Wolf, who used to know Ellie. He is the one who asked Mia about Peyton during the tour. He keeps dodging around the subject of Peyton's real father, but says a little more about him each time Peyton brings him up. Peyton continues to get to know Mick and continues to ask about her real father. When she asks him why her parents gave her up and, he replies, [...] "We... I mean they, had a tough decision." [...] Mick accidentally lets the truth slip out, and suddenly Peyton realizes this is her father. She invites him over for a nice dinner together, he instead goes and gets drunk at a bar after being sober for a year (as shown by a sobriety chip in his pocket). She and Lucas have also set a date for their wedding, which causes conflict between Lucas and Lindsey with regards to the book tour for his second book. Peyton closes herself off emotionally with regard to Mick and is angry with him for not being upfront with her about who he is. She tells him to leave. Not long afterward, during a visit to Brooke's, Brooke tells Peyton the truth about how she got all the bruises on her body. Peyton is later seen on the phone with Larry, her adoptive father. She tells him how much she loves him. Though initially concerned about moving in together, Lucas and Peyton eventually decide to accept their differences and reside in the same house. Peyton reconnects with her biological brother Derek, who has returned from the war. Later, she goes to TRIC to meet up with Lucas <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> named Julian, who is interested in making a movie out based on Lucas's first novel.
