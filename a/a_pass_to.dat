5|$|Tech's post-touchdown kickoff bounced to the Clemson two-yard line {{before it}} was {{returned}} to the Clemson 12-yard line. An incomplete pass on first down {{was followed by a}} first-down pass to Gardner at the 22-yard line. Dantzler then completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Watts at the 34-yard line for another first down. After an incomplete pass, Dantzler scrambled for a first down at the Clemson 47-yard line, where he completed a 17-yard pass to Robinson as time ticked below one minute remaining. From the Tech 36-yard line, Dantzler completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Gardner at the Tech 29-yard line. After a time out with 33 seconds remaining, Dantzler threw an incomplete pass. This was followed by another incomplete pass, and Clemson converted the first down with <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> the Tech 24-yard line. An incomplete pass on first down was followed by another on second down. Following the play, there was only eight seconds left on the clock, and coach Bowden ordered Hunt into the game to attempt a 41-yard field goal. The kick was short and to the right, and Clemson turned the ball over with two seconds remaining. Vick took a knee to run the final seconds off the clock, and Virginia Tech entered halftime with a 2110 lead.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Tennessee in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a first-and-10 at the Virginia Tech 37-yard line after a long punt return. Stewart ran twice for six yards, then Manning completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Kent at the 20-yard line for a first down. Manning then completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Nash for another first down at the Tech five-yard line. Two plays later, Stewart scored his third touchdown of {{the game with a}} five-yard run to {{the right side of the}} field. The extra point was good, and with 13:17 remaining in the game, Tennessee took a 4216 lead.|$|E
25|$|Tech {{returned}} the kickoff {{to its own}} 17-yard line, but a holding penalty forced Tech to start on its own nine-yard line. Wilson begane the drive with an eight-yard run. Thomas advanced the ball 41 yards in two plays, with <b>an</b> 11-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Davis and <b>a</b> 30-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Coale. After <b>a</b> Wilson one-yard run, Thomas completed <b>a</b> 12-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Coale, giving Tech a first down at the Michigan 31-yard line. Following <b>an</b> incomplete <b>pass</b> intended for Davis, Thomas completed <b>a</b> 15-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Chris Drager. Wilson rushed for no gain, but Thomas completed <b>an</b> eight-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Coale, giving Tech a third-and-two on the Michigan eight-yard line. Tech committed a false start penalty, making it third-and-seven from the 13-yard line. Thomas completed <b>an</b> eight-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Boykin, but settled for the tying 25-yard field goal from Myer after a timeout from each team. The game went to overtime with the score tied at 20.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Tampa Bay struck first with Quarterback Jay Gruden {{completing}} <b>a</b> 12-yard touchdown <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> OL/DL Lynn Rowland, yet the Barnstormers {{took the lead}} with Quarterback Kurt Warner completing <b>a</b> 16-yard touchdown <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR/LB Chris Spencer and <b>a</b> 30-yard touchdown <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> OS Lamont Cooper. The Storm would wrap up the period with Gruden completing <b>a</b> 30-yard touchdown <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> OS George LaFrance (with a failed PAT).|$|R
50|$|On the Packers next drive, Aaron Rodgers {{and company}} moved {{the ball down}} to the Cleveland 48-yard line with <b>a</b> short <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Donald Lee, <b>a</b> 13-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Donald Driver and <b>a</b> 6-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Greg Jennings. The drive was capped off with <b>a</b> short right <b>pass</b> from Aaron Rodgers to linebacker turned tight end Spencer Havner. Havner pulled in the pass {{and ran down the}} right {{sideline}} 45 yards for a touchdown to claim a 7-3 Packers lead.|$|R
5|$|To begin {{its first}} {{series of the}} second half, Boise State {{returned}} the post-touchdown kickoff 55yards. Two quick plays later, Boise quarterback Taylor Tharp completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Jeremy Avery for a touchdown, cutting East Carolina's lead to 17points, 38–21.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, and Shyrone Stith returned the opening kickoff from the end zone to the Tech 44-yard line. On the first play of the game, Tech quarterback Al Clark completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Angelo Harrison, but Alabama committed a five-yard offsides penalty, setting up the Hokies at their 49-yard line. After the penalty, running back Lamont Pegues ran straight ahead for a gain of four yards then picked up a first down with a short gain on the next play. Clark completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Harrison at the 43-yard line, then Clark broke free of the Alabama defense on an improvised run, scrambling 43 {{yards for a touchdown}} and the game's first points. Kicker Shayne Graham kicked the extra point, and Virginia Tech took a 70 lead over Alabama with 12:25 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Maryland {{advanced}} to the Oklahoma 20-yard line, and Tatum elected for a field goal attempt. Now against the wind, the kick failed, with the ball going wide right. The Sooners took over on downs and halfback Jack Ging completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> end Max Boydston for a five-yard gain. Ging then rushed for threeyards. On the next play, Calame pitched to Grigg who ran {{to the left and}} picked up 12yards for a first down. Calame then completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> back Bob Burris for sixyards. Grigg faked a pass and ran to the right for a gain of 12yards and a first down on the Maryland 39-yard line. The Terrapins stopped two Sooner rushing attempts before Calame connected with Burris again for an 11-yard gain. Burris then rushed for threemore yards to advance to the Maryland 25. Tatum called a time-out. On third down with oneyard to go, Calame faked a handoff to Ging and executed an option run to the left. He pitched to Grigg and threw a block. Grigg was tackled at the goal-line but managed to extend his body into the endzone. Buddy Leake made the extra point. Shortly before halftime, Calame suffered a separated collarbone. With back-up Pat O'Neal also injured, only third-string quarterback Jack Van Pool remained, and he had little game experience.|$|E
50|$|South Carolina {{maintained}} possession to {{open the}} second quarter, but after a sack by LB A.J. Hilliard for −2 yards on third down, the Aggies got the ball back. Their possession had several explosive plays, including an 11-yard run by Trey Williams, <b>a</b> 21-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Ricky Seals-Jones, and <b>a</b> 15-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Edward Pope before being capped off by <b>a</b> 3-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Ricky Seals-Jones for the TD, making the score 17-7. The Gamecocks answered this score too, on <b>a</b> long 46-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Damiere Byrd for a touchdown, cutting the game to 17-14. Texas A&M’s offense proved difficult to stop, however, and their next possession contained more big-yardage plays, including <b>a</b> 19-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Ricky Seals-Jones, <b>a</b> 16-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> RB Tra Carson, and the 14-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Edward Pope for the touchdown. South Carolina could not answer that score, giving the ball back to A&M with 3:35 {{to go in the}} half. Spurred on by <b>a</b> 21-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> senior WR Malcome Kennedy, the Aggies made a quick 2 minute, 19 second drive for another TD by Tra Carson, putting the game at 31-14. South Carolina’s final drive of the half was highlighted by two big defensive plays from A&M. The first was a big hit from freshman safety Armani Watts <b>to</b> dislodge <b>a</b> touchdown <b>pass</b> on 2nd-and-10, followed directly by an 11-yard sack from freshman DE Myles Garrett. Facing a 4th-and-21, Carolina attempted and missed a 54-yard Field Goal.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Pittsburgh tried to recover with Roethlisberger {{completing}} <b>a</b> 13-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR Santonio Holmes, but the Broncos answered with Cutler completing <b>a</b> 1-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> TE Tony Scheffler. In the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh managed {{to tie the}} game with Roethlisberger completing <b>a</b> 13-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> rookie TE Matt Spaeth, along with <b>a</b> 12-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Miller. Unfortunately, Denver managed to get kicker Jason Elam to nail a last-second 49-yard field goal.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the Ravens {{increased}} their lead as RB Willis McGahee got a 1-yard TD run. Houston responded as Rosenfels completed <b>a</b> 60-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR Kevin Walter. However, {{in the fourth}} quarter, Baltimore greatly pulled away as Flacco completed <b>a</b> 1-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> TE Todd Heap (with <b>a</b> 2-point conversion <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR Derrick Mason), QB Troy Smith completed <b>a</b> 14-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Heap, and McGahee getting a 4-yard TD run.|$|R
5|$|Kendrick {{returned}} Clemson's post-score kickoff to the Tech 23-yard line. A two-yard run by Suggs {{was followed}} by <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Davis at the Tech 39-yard line for a first down. Two running plays set up third down and two, then Vick completed a 50-yard pass to Kendrick, who picked up a first down at the Clemson four-yard line. From there, it took Suggs two rushes to pass the goal line for Virginia Tech's third touchdown of the game. The extra point was good, and Tech extended its lead to 2110 with 2:26 before halftime.|$|E
5|$|On Tech's first {{offensive}} {{play of the}} game, a pass by Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller was dropped. During {{the next}} play, Tech picked up four yards on a running play. On third down, Druckenmiller completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> wide receiver Bryan Still, but the play fell one foot short of a first down. Tech punted after three plays, just as Texas had done. Texas returned the kick to its 22-yard line, and with 11:49 remaining in the quarter, the Longhorns began their second possession of the game.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland offense had {{difficulty}} converting third downs, and managed only four on 13attempts, while their defense allowed 226passing yards and 201rushing yards. Late {{in the first}} quarter, Virginia quarterback Marc Verica completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> receiver Kevin Ogletree for a 51-yard touchdown, the Cavs' first passing score of the season. Virginia was able to score twice more before half, to put the Terrapins into a 21–0 deficit. With {{seconds left in the}} second quarter, in a desperate gambit to recoup some points, quarterback Chris Turner attempted a hook and ladder play with <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Isaiah Williams who then lateraled to Darrius Heyward-Bey, who in turn lateraled to Da'Rel Scott. The maneuver picked up 45yards before Scott was shoved out of bounds, and a flag was thrown for a late hit by Virginia. Since a half cannot end on a defensive penalty, time would {{have been added to the}} clock, but it was ruled that the foul occurred after time had expired. Therefore, the penalty was assessed after the kick-off, and the Terrapins' trick play was for naught.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} quarter, the Firebirds took flight first with QB Mike Pawlawski {{completing}} <b>a</b> 12-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR-DB Eddie Brown. The Predators responded with QB Connell Maynor completing <b>a</b> 22-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR-DB Barry Wagner. Albany would reply with a 1-yard TD run by FB/LB Jon Krick. Orlando bounced back with Maynor completing <b>a</b> 37-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR-LB Ty Law. The Firebirds answered again with Pawlawski completing <b>a</b> 2-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR-DB Van Johnson.|$|R
5|$|Receiving {{the ball}} at their own 8-yard line {{following}} a penalty on the kickoff return, Buffalo began to move down the field, with Drew Willy completing <b>a</b> 38-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> wideout Brett Hamlin and <b>a</b> 29-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Naaman Roosevelt. On 3rd-and-4 from the Connecticut 19-yard line, Willy completed <b>a</b> ten-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> James Starks, giving the Bulls a 1st-and-goal. Starks rushed for fouryards on firstdown; on seconddown, Willy threw <b>an</b> incomplete <b>pass</b> intended for Roosevelt. On 3rd-and-goal from the Husky 5-yard line, Willy attempted <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> that was deflected and intercepted by UConn safety Dahna Deleston, who returned the ball 100yards for the game-sealing touchdown. UConn won the game 38–20.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the Ravens {{increased}} their lead as RB Willis McGahee got a 1-yard TD run. Houston would answer as QB Sage Rosenfels completed <b>a</b> 60-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR Kevin Walter. In the fourth quarter, Baltimore steamrolled {{their way to}} victory with Flacco completing <b>a</b> 1-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> TE Todd Heap (with <b>a</b> 2-point conversion <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR Derrick Mason), QB Troy Smith completing <b>a</b> 14-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Heap, and McGahee rushing four yards for a TD.|$|R
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball with a first down at its 30-yard line. The Hokie drive fizzled, as had most of the offense in the third quarter, after DeShazo was sacked for a big loss on third down. Indiana returned the Tech punt to its 43-yard line, and Indiana brought in its backup quarterback, Chris Dittoe, to lead the offense. After being sacked on his first play, Dittoe completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> near midfield, making up the yardage that had been lost on the sack. Despite that gain, Indiana couldn't make up the yardage lost to the sack {{and appeared to be}} ready to punt the ball. Instead, the Hoosiers faked the punt and threw <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> an undefended Indiana player who dropped the ball. Following the turnover, Virginia Tech's offense started work at the Indiana 49-yard line. After being stopped short on two rushes, DeShazo completed a 42-yard pass to Antonio Freeman, who raced down the field and into the end zone. The extra point was good, and with 9:37 remaining in the game, Tech took a 3513 lead.|$|E
5|$|With 4:50 {{remaining}} on the clock, and the ball on their own eight-yard line, Maryland drove 89yards to the Wolfpack three-yard line, which included <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Davin Meggett for 31yards. This set up a 20-yard field goal attempt by Obi Egekeze with eightseconds on the clock. The kick was good and put Maryland ahead for good, 27–24.|$|E
5|$|A one-yard rush was {{followed}} by <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> running back Ken Oxendine that lost three yards. Following the negative-yardage play, North Carolina committed a five-yard penalty that gave the Hokies a third down and seven. Despite the extra yardage provided by the penalty, Clark's pass attempt on third down was incomplete and the Hokies again prepared to punt. During the kick, however, North Carolina defender Quinton Savage broke through the Virginia Tech offensive line and blocked the punt by Jimmy Kibble. Tar Heels' defender Dre Bly picked up the loose ball {{and ran into the}} end zone for North Carolina's second touchdown of the game. Following the play, North Carolina was penalized 15 yards for excessive celebration and the resulting 35-yard extra point kick was no good. Despite the missed kick, North Carolina extended its lead to 160 with 1:03 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the Steelers {{tried to come}} back with Roethlisberger {{completing}} <b>a</b> 13-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR Santonio Holmes. Fortunately, Denver answered with Cutler completing <b>a</b> 1-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> TE Tony Scheffler. In the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh managed to tie the game with Roethlisberger completing <b>a</b> 13-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> TE Matt Spaeth and <b>a</b> 12-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Miller. Fortunately, kicker Jason Elam came through for the third time this year as he nailed the game-winning 49-yard field goal.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} quarter, the Bears drew first blood as QB Kyle Orton {{completed}} <b>a</b> 19-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> TE Greg Olsen. The Eagles responded with McNabb completing <b>a</b> 22-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR DeSean Jackson. In the second quarter, Chicago responded with Orton completing <b>a</b> 23-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR Marty Booker. Philadelphia responded with RB Correll Buckhalter getting a 1-yard TD run. The Bears closed out the half with Orton completing <b>a</b> 20-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR/KR Devin Hester.|$|R
5000|$|The coach tosses {{balls to}} the setter (or <b>a</b> <b>passer</b> <b>passes</b> <b>to</b> the setter).|$|R
5|$|After {{the fight}} at Taejon, UN forces were pushed back {{repeatedly}} before finally halting the North Korean advance {{in a series}} of engagements in the southern section of the country. Forces of the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, opening <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> the Pusan area from the west. Soon after, North Korean forces took Chinju, east of Hadong, pushing back the US 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to Pusan open to direct North Korean attacks. The UN formations were subsequently able to defeat the North Koreans in the Battle of the Notch on August 2, halting their advance from the west. Suffering mounting losses, the KPA force withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|After {{upsetting}} second-ranked Michigan State, 34–7, Maryland {{climbed to}} an AP Poll ranking of {{eighth in the}} nation and then defeated Georgetown. The following game they met N.C. State at Byrd Stadium for Homecoming weekend. In the first quarter, a Maryland fumble rolled out of the end zone for a safety, and soon after, another fumble set up a touchdown rush by NC State. Maryland advanced inside the N.C. State five-yard line three times but was unable to score. In the third quarter, NC State scored again to expand their lead, 0–16. Maryland scored on a 21-yard pass from Jack Scarbath to Bob Shemonski. With three minutes remaining, Shemonski connected with <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Pete Augsburger for another touchdown. A 47-yard drive into Wolfpack territory ended with an interception in the end zone with seconds remaining. The loss effectively ended the Terrapins' hopes for a bowl game bid. The second loss dropped them out of the AP Poll {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{continued}} their scoring {{into the third}} quarter with touchdowns on their first two possessions of the half. The first came on a 38-yard McCarron pass to Amari Cooper on a drive that also saw McCarron complete <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> his brother Corey McCarron. The second came on a 31-yard Chris Black run that made the score 42–0. With the Crimson Tide significantly up, mostly back-up players completed the fourth quarter. After a long drive stalled at the Mocs' 23-yard line, Eddie Jackson returned a C. J. Board fumble caused by Jonathan Allen to the Chattanooga six-yard line. On the next play, Dee Hart made the final score 49–0 with his six-yard touchdown run. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Mocs to 12–0.|$|E
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Baltimore {{increased}} its lead with QB Troy Smith completing <b>a</b> 15-TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR Devard Darling {{for the only}} score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh tried to rally as QB Charlie Batch completed <b>a</b> 59-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR Santonio Holmes and <b>a</b> 7-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR Cedric Wilson. However, the Ravens managed to hold on for the win.|$|R
50|$|Anderson {{completed}} <b>a</b> 30-yard scoring <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Cody Slate with 12:30 left in {{the second}} quarter, then hit Chuck Walker with <b>a</b> 15-yard <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> give Marshall <b>a</b> 17-0 lead with 1:43 {{left in the}} first half.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Cincinnati tried to rally as QB Carson Palmer {{completed}} <b>an</b> 18-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh. In the fourth quarter, the Bengals got closer as Graham got a 40-yard field goal, yet the Cowboys answered with Romo completing <b>a</b> 57-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR Terrell Owens. Cincinnati {{tried to come}} back as Palmer completed <b>a</b> 10-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Houshmandzadeh (with <b>a</b> failed 2-point conversion), but Dallas pulled away with Romo completing <b>a</b> 15-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR Patrick Crayton.|$|R
5|$|American forces finally {{halted the}} North Korean advance {{in a series}} of engagements in the {{southern}} section of the country. Forces of the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, opening <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> the Pusan area. Soon after, North Korean forces took Chinju to the west, pushing back the US 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the Pusan open for more North Korean attacks. US formations were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the KPA force in the west withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|At the interval, Liverpool defender Mark Wright was {{replaced}} by Steve Harkness. Nine minutes into the second-half, Liverpool scored their goal; Jason McAteer played the ball towards McManaman, running at the Newcastle defence in their penalty box and picking out <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Fowler, who scored his second goal of the match. Liverpool's advantage only lasted for two minutes; Asprilla, put through by Robert Lee, scored with the outside of his right boot. Newcastle began to dominate territorially and missed a chance to increase their lead shortly after Asprilla's goal: Ginola's misplaced final ball failed to reach an incoming Ferdinand. Liverpool continued to press forward and in the 65th minute levelled the score again; McAteer's curling cross confused the Newcastle defence and reached Collymore, who took a shot past goalkeeper Pavel Srníček.|$|E
5|$|Because NC State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Tech received NC State's kickoff and returned it to the 10-yard line, where the Hokie offense began work. Tech began working down the field, running the ball for short gains and throwing passes for longer gains. Tech picked up three first downs, then reached NC State territory on <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> Donnelly. Once on the NC State side of the field, Tech picked up another first down, but Tech's quarterback was sacked on third down for a loss, and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball away. The ball landed at the NC State 12-yard line where the Wolfpack began a drive.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} quarter, St. Louis drew first blood as Frerotte {{completed}} <b>a</b> 1-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> TE Randy McMichael and <b>a</b> 31-yard TD <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> WR Torry Holt.
