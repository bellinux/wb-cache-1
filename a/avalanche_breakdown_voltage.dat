40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on low voltage (∼ 1 kV) 4 H-SiC power DMOSFET design. The {{objective of the}} thesis is to achieve the smallest possible specific onresistance for 1 kV blocking voltage. 4 H-SiC is a wide bandgap (Eg = 3. 3 eV) semiconductor with high critical electric field, which makes it suitable for high voltage, high power applications. The main problem for the 4 H-SiC MOS devices is the low inversion channel mobility, which makes the channel resistance the most dominant component of the total on-resistance. The exceptionally low inversion channel mobility (∼ 20 cm 2 /V-s) is attributed to the high interface state densities near the conduction band edge and the surface roughening caused by high temperature implant annealing. As channel resistance is linearly proportional to both channel mobility and channel length, a self-aligned technology was used to reduce the channel length below 0. 5 μm. The fabricated device on 6 μm epilayer produced a specific on-resistance of 9. 95 mohm-cm 2 for an <b>avalanche</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>voltage</b> of 900 V. The problem with these devices was the high gate oxide field (6 MV/cm), which implied a poor reliability. To overcome this problem {{as well as to}} reduce the specific on-resistance further, an exhaustive simulation study was done and an optimized DMOSFET structure was proposed. The new design includes a novel highly doped current spreading layer and a highly-doped JFET region to reduce the total on-resistance, and a JFET length of 1 μm was used to reduce the gate oxide field at the onset of avalanche breakdown. Moreover, an alignment tolerance of 0. 5 μm was used to reduce the cell pitch and thereby the specific on-resistance. Electron beam lithography was used to implement these short features. The fabricated device produced a specific on-resistance of 6. 95 mohm-cm 2 for a blocking voltage of 1050 V. The specific on-resistance of the fabricated devices was slightly higher than the simulated result (4. 0 mohm-cm 2) due to unexpectedly high contact resistivities. ...|$|E

This thesis focuses on the APD design and fabrication component of the sensing capability required by smart-lighting systems. Silicon CMOS compatible APDs are expected to provide high-speed and high-sensitivity sensors in terms of simplicity of design, low power consumption and cost-effectiveness for smart-lighting applications.

The recursive dead-space multiplication theory (DSMT), {{is applied to the}} recently fabricated thin Si n+p APDs to predict the avalanche and breakdown properties including low excess noise factor. The low excess noise factor is due to the presence of dead space effect and the initiation of avalanche process by the photogenerated electron in the depletion region of Si APDs.
