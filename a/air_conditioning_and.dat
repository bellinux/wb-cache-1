5|$|Before its studio's second production, Oriental began renting {{the studios}} of Algemeen Nederlandsch Indisch Filmsyndicaat (ANIF) in Molenvliet, Batavia, for 1,500 gulden a month.

A large adjacent plot of land was also included. By renting the ANIF complex, Oriental became {{the largest and most}} modern studio in the Indies.|$|E
5|$|For ease of {{training}} and fleet conversion, de Havilland designed the Comet's flight deck layout {{with a degree of}} similarity to the Lockheed Constellation, an aircraft that was popular at the time with key customers such as BOAC. The cockpit included full dual-controls for the captain and first officer, while a flight engineer controlled various key systems, including fuel, <b>air</b> <b>conditioning,</b> <b>and</b> electrical systems. The navigator occupied a dedicated station with a table across from the flight engineer.|$|E

5|$|At some U.S. {{international}} airports, such as O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, some {{seating and}} waiting areas are {{located away from}} the terminal building, with passengers being shuttled to terminals. These areas may {{be referred to as}} ground transportation centers or intermodal centers. Amenities at ground transportation centers typically include restrooms and seating, and may also provide ticket counters, food and beverage sales and retail goods such as magazines. Some ground transportation centers have heating and <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>and</b> covered boarding areas (to protect passengers from the elements).|$|E
5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four {{hydraulic}} systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin <b>air</b> <b>conditioning,</b> <b>and</b> the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working even if only a single engine was active. The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay. A pressurised refuelling system, developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.|$|E

5|$|The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) had an {{ownership}} {{stake in}} the complex ever since Centre Square was constructed and in 1992 became the sole owner. Wolgin sold his {{stake in the}} complex in the early 1980s, and a partnership led by Metropolitan Life of Virginia {{took control of the}} complex around 2000. In 2002 MetLife put the property up for sale, and in October of that year HRPT Properties Trust bought Centre Square for US$183.5 million plus closing costs. With the acquisition of Centre Square, HRPT Properties Trust (now called Equity Commonwealth) began an improvement and renovation plan for the complex. Improvements included modernization of its elevator, <b>air</b> <b>conditioning,</b> <b>and</b> safety systems. Architectural firm Daroff Design Inc.'s plans included cleaning the structures and a redesign of parts of the atrium and the plaza in front of the building.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1959, Mona Best decided to open a club in her cellar, and offered the Les Stewart Quartet a {{residency}} if they would help convert the cellar. Harrison and fellow Quartet guitarist Ken Brown, however, missed a show, causing Les Stewart to fire the two and drop the residency. This caused distress to Best, but Harrison offered a solution: he recruited Lennon and McCartney to play, and they returned to calling themselves the Quarrymen. After helping Best finish converting the cellar, the new four guitarist line-up of the Quarrymen (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Brown) opened the Casbah Coffee Club on 29 August 1959. The opening night performance was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>and</b> people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe. The Quarrymen were afforded the use of Brown's three input amplifier (which, along with McCartney's Elpico, meant that all four guitarists were electric), and sang through one microphone connected to the club's small PA system.|$|E

25|$|<b>Air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>and</b> heating in {{buildings}} and motor vehicles {{are two of}} the largest applications for heat exchangers. While copper tube is used in most <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>and</b> refrigeration systems, typical air conditioning units currently use aluminium fins. These systems can harbor bacteria and mold and develop odors and fouling that can make them function poorly. Stringent new requirements including demands for increased operating efficiencies and the reduction or elimination of harmful emissions are enhancing copper's role in modern HVAC systems.|$|E
