COMIGAL worked {{in cooperation with the}} United States Operations Mission, the non-military wing of the American presence and the Military Assistance Advisory Group. Although COMIGAL was purely dedicated to refugee issues, there was a constant turnover of public servants through their staff, and the benefits of continuity did not materialize. After only a few months in the job, Luong was replaced by Pham Van Huyen on December 7, 1954. COMIGAL were supplemented by <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> aid agencies and an advisory group from Michigan State University, where Diem had stayed while in self-imposed exile in the early 1950s. There were three phases in the resettlement program. With more than 4,000new arrivals per day, the northerners were housed in Saigon and Vũng Tàu in 42 makeshift reception centers. These consisted of existing schools, vacated French barracks, churches and tent cities on the grounds of Tan Son Nhut Air Base and Phú Thọ Racecourse. These could not be used indefinitely as the grounds needed to be used for their preexisting purpose, and furthermore, such ad hoc areas were vulnerable to outbreaks of fire and disease.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 243 - 251) John Paul's epic {{visit to}} the United States in 1987 was viewed by <b>American</b> <b>Catholics</b> with both joy and frustration. By rhetorically analyzing the discourse from John Paul's 1987 {{visit to the}} United States, I answered two questions: (1) What {{is the relationship between}} John Paul and <b>American</b> <b>Catholics?</b> and (2) How is that relationship constructed through the rhetoric of both John Paul and <b>American</b> <b>Catholics</b> from the 1987 United States visit? To answer these questions, I did an emic analysis of five speeches given by John Paul to <b>American</b> <b>Catholics</b> during the visit and three speeches given to John Paul by <b>American</b> <b>Catholics</b> during the visit. I then did a rough content analysis of the 20 remaining speeches given by John Paul to <b>American</b> <b>Catholics</b> and the 11 remaining speeches given to John Paul by <b>American</b> <b>Catholics.</b> In my analysis, I looked for rhetorical devices used in the speeches. The relationship between John Paul and <b>American</b> <b>Catholics</b> is strained; however, this conclusion is not surprising given the tense situation existing between John Paul and <b>American</b> <b>Catholics</b> prior to the visit. John Paul sees himself as having complete authority over <b>American</b> <b>Catholics.</b> He is concerned about them, and he shows his affection for them, but he will accept no deviation from church doctrine. <b>American</b> <b>Catholics</b> are loyal to the church, but they want a more even distribution of the authority. They want dialogue with Rome. In addition to determining the relationship between John Paul and <b>American</b> <b>Catholics,</b> I confirmed the importance of the speaker-audience relationship, for the rhetorical construction of the relationship affects the success of the communication. The rhetorical critic can use the method I developed to study the speaker-audience relationship. The rhetor can also use knowledge of the speaker-audience relationship to construct more effective rhetoric. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R
