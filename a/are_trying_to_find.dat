5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Rich Moore. Barney's apartment, which Homer spends the night in when he is kicked out by Marge, is partly based on an apartment Jim Reardon, Moore, {{and a few other}} animators of The Simpsons shared in college. One of the strip clubs Homer and Bart visit when they <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Princess Kashmir is based on the Seventh Veil Strip Club in Los Angeles, California. The staff went around Hollywood taking pictures of strip clubs so that they could get inspiration for the interior design of the strip club buildings in Springfield. The character designer designed over fifty different international showgirl costumes for the showgirls in the burlesque show sequence. Carl Carlson made his first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode.|$|E
5|$|The game then jumps {{five years}} forward. Nier {{and the others}} <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the parts to a key that they believe will help them locate the Shadowlord and Grimoire Noir. After {{defeating}} five Shades and assembling the key, the team go to defeat the Shadowlord. There, Devola and Popola, characters who have been guiding Nier on his quest, appear {{to try to stop}} them. They explain that over 1300 years prior, humanity faced extinction due to an incurable disease. In an attempt to survive, they separated their souls from their bodies using Grimoire Noir and Weiss. They created clones resistant to the disease, Replicants, and intended to recombine the souls, or Gestalts, with the Replicant bodies once it had died out; Devola and Popola were androids set to oversee the project. Over time, the Replicants had begun to form their own identities; while the Gestalts, or Shades, had grown aggressive to them.|$|E

25|$|Calculus is used {{in every}} branch of the {{physical}} sciences, actuarial science, computer science, statistics, engineering, economics, business, medicine, demography, and in other fields wherever a problem can be mathematically modeled and an optimal solution is desired. It allows one to go from (non-constant) rates of change to the total change or vice versa, and many times in studying a problem we know one and <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the other.|$|E

They still take much caution, however, {{as they can be}} subject to fines and have the additional risk of the complete shutdown of their business following multiple offenses. Smoking customers themselves are subject to fines up to around $44.|$|E

25|$|There {{are limits}} to electrophoretic techniques. Since passing current through a gel causes heating, gels may melt during electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is {{performed}} in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution. There are also limitations in determining the molecular weight by SDS-PAGE, especially if you <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the MW of an unknown protein. There are certain biological variables that are difficult or impossible to minimize and can affect the electrophoretic migration. Such factors include protein structure, post-translational modifications, and amino acid composition. For example, tropomyosin is an acidic protein that migrates abnormally on SDS-PAGE gels. This is because the acidic residues are repelled by the negatively charged SDS, leading to an inaccurate mass-to-charge ratio and migration. Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.|$|E
25|$|The {{immune system}} must balance between being {{sensitive}} {{enough to protect}} against infection, and become sensitized to attack the body's own proteins (autoimmunity). During an immune reaction to a foreign stimulus, such as bacteria, virus, or allergen, immune cells that would normally be deactivated due to their affinity for self-tissues can be abnormally activated by signaling sequences of antigen-presenting cells. Thus triggers may include viruses, bacteria, allergens (IgE and other hypersensitivity), and can be aggravated by environmental stimulants such as ultraviolet light and certain drug reactions. These stimuli begin a reaction that leads to destruction of other cells {{in the body and}} exposure of their DNA, histones, and other proteins, particularly parts of the cell nucleus. The body's sensitized B-lymphocyte cells will now produce antibodies against these nuclear-related proteins. These antibodies clump into antibody-protein complexes which stick to surfaces and damage blood vessels in critical areas of the body, such as the glomeruli of the kidney; these antibody attacks are the cause of SLE. Researchers are now identifying the individual genes, the proteins they produce, and their role in the immune system. Each protein is a link on the autoimmune chain, and researchers <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> drugs to break each of those links.|$|E
25|$|This {{version of}} Light is {{different}} to his manga counterpart {{in the fact}} that he never loses sight of his goal to make the world better for the innocent. Unlike Light Yagami, Light Turner never kills any police officers and never truly lets the power of the Death Note overtake him. Instead, his ruthless qualities are transferred to Mia, who uses the notebook in secret to kill police and innocents that <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Light and, by association, herself. In the end, she writes Light's name in the notebook to make him transfer ownership of the notebook to her, showing her true nature and calling the death note her notebook. However, Light creates a plan that will result in his survival and her death if she attempts to take the notebook, which she does despite how much he tries to convince her to let it go and be with him instead, having truly fallen in love with Mia by writing her name in it as well. In the end, through using two criminals that he controlled using the Death Note, Light manages to trick the police into believing that he wasn't Kira with the exception of his father, who worked out the truth after finding newspaper articles about his mother's murder. The film ends with his father asking Light, in response to what he said, if he was truly {{the lesser of two evils}} when compared to Mia while L finds a page of the death note, and wonders whether to write Light's name.|$|E

500|$|The {{story is}} set in a fictional world, in a barren and poverty-stricken region called the Uplands, some of whose {{inhabitants}} have hereditary magical gifts. The story follows the narrator Orrec, son of the leader of the domain of Caspromant, whose hereditary gift is the ability to [...] "unmake", and Gry, the daughter of a neighboring domain, who can communicate with animals. Orrec's gift manifests late, and seems uncontrollable, and so he is blindfolded. Their families are caught up in the cycle of violent feuds and retribution that characterize Upland society in which the children <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their place.|$|E
500|$|In her director's notes, Burshtein wrote, [...] "I love Jane Austen. She's romantic, intelligent, {{and full}} of humor. … The {{parallel}} is also quite obvious in that 'Fill the Void' {{takes place in a}} world where the rules are rigid and clear. The characters are not looking for some way to burst out of that world. Instead, they <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way to live within it." [...] Critics noted the similarities between Austen's characters and those in Fill the Void, and Stephanie Merry from The Washington Post likened the character of Frieda to Charlotte Lucas from Pride and Prejudice. Frieda, like Charlotte, has never had any marriage prospects and is the subject of others' pity as a result.|$|E
500|$|By April 2000, Columbia dropped Doctor Strange, {{which then}} had Michael France {{attached}} {{to write a}} script and interest from Chuck Russell and Stephen Norrington to direct. By June 2001, Dimension Films acquired the film rights, with Goyer back on board as writer and director. Goyer hinted scheduling conflicts might ensue with a film adaptation of Murder Mysteries, and promised not to be highly dependent on computer-generated imagery. However, by August 2001, Miramax acquired the film rights from Dimension, and by March 2002, Goyer {{had dropped out of}} the project. A 2005 release date was announced the next March, while in June 2004, a script still had yet to be written. Marvel Studios CEO Avi Arad stated, [...] "We are nowhere with that. That's a tough one to write, but we are working on it. We <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the real Jerry Garcia of the writing community." [...] In April 2005, Paramount Pictures acquired Doctor Strange from Miramax, as part of Marvel Studios' attempt to independently produce their own films. At the time, the film was projected to have a budget of no more than $165 million.|$|E

2500|$|As the EU's fifth largest economy, Spain {{remains a}} large concern. In 2011 Mariano Rajoy {{took over the}} {{government}} with his conservative views, pushing out José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and his left-wing views. [...] Trying to get Spain out of the highest unemployment rate in the European Union was proven to be harder than expected. The bailout for Spain has been estimated to {{not be enough to}} restore the economy. [...] There is a serious debt in the country, and substantial cuts would have to be put in place to restore the economy at this point. The recession has been a concern for a while and shows no sign of lifting any time soon as Spain has yet to meet budget cuts and shows no sign of changing. [...] Many youths <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> jobs abroad, creating a problem for the future domestic economy and job market.

[...] Ruzanna Bagratunyan, spokesperson for the center, stated that the movie [...] "is a huge load of work, and {{we are trying to do}} it in time; all of us understand what this date [...] means for the whole Armenian nation." ...|$|E

Adams traveled to Melbourne, Australia in December 2009 for the World Religions Conference. In an appearance on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program hosted by Tony Eastley, AM, Adams stated, [...] "From one church in 1954 to ... we're in 165 nations now; we have 8,000 churches, missions and groups right across this fair earth of ours." [...] Adams disputed assertions of abuse within Scientology publicized {{on the floor of}} the Australian Senate by Senator Nick Xenophon and commented, [...] "It's not that the allegations aren't serious charges; the fact of the matter is that they are unsubstantiated rumours. Many of these so-called charges, so-called allegations are very old. I mean, 12 or 15 years ago, these incidents occurred, were thoroughly reviewed." [...] Regarding statements by Senator Xenophon that women within Scientology who became pregnant were pressured into having abortions, Adams said, [...] "That's someone's statement of... it's totally false. There's no proof whatsoever; no one has ever made... no one has come forward and said here's the proof." [...] Adams asserted to The Age that all of the critical statements made by Senator Xenophon about Scientology in the Australian Senate were [...] "meritless". He commented, [...] "One way to measure that is how law enforcement responds to any of these allegations. There has been no interest because there has been no evidence.
