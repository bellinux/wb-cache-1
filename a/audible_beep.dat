2500|$|The pendant Electronic Row Counter was {{produced}} in the early 21st century and was sold in the United States at least until 2010. [...] Its LCD display counts up to 4 digits, whereas all foregoing knitting row counters were limited to 2 digits. It has add- and subtract-buttons which allow the user to count forwards and backwards in increments of one with an <b>audible</b> <b>beep</b> at each press, and the on-off button {{can be used to}} reset the count to zero. [...] Because there is no memory facility, the counter must be left turned on if the count is to be maintained; however the gadget's instructions say that the battery will last for over seven months. There is no lock so that the maintained count is vulnerable to playing children. The more complex version of this counter, the Electronic Row Counter Plus, has ceased manufacture.|$|E

5000|$|The use of profanity and {{offensive}} language on free-to-air broadcasts in the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Japan is sometimes censored by replacing the profane {{word or phrase}} with an <b>audible</b> <b>beep(s),</b> often accompanied by obscuring the speaker's mouth to prevent lip-reading. If there is a closed captioning, the word is commonly replaced by asterisks, used as a mixture of letters and asterisks, or [...] "bleep" [...] is used.|$|R
5000|$|Avalanche Transceivers — {{known as}} beacons, [...] "beepers", peeps (pieps), ARVAs (Appareil de Recherche de Victimes en Avalanche, in French), LVS (Lawinen-Verschütteten-Suchgerät, Swiss German), or various other trade names, are {{important}} for {{every member of the}} party. They emit a [...] "beep" [...] via 457 kHz radio signal in normal use, but may be switched to receive mode to locate a buried victim up to 80 meters away. Analog receivers provide <b>audible</b> <b>beeps</b> that rescuers interpret to estimate distance to a victim. To use the receiver effectively requires regular practice. Some older models of beepers operated on a different frequency (2.275 kHz [...] ) and a group leader should ensure these are no longer in use.|$|R

50|$|A {{rotary laser}} level {{is a more}} {{advanced}} laser level in that it spins the beam of light fast enough to give {{the effect of a}} complete 360 degree horizontal or vertical plane, thus illuminating not just a fixed line, but a horizontal plane. The laser beam projector employs a rotating head with a mirror for sweeping the laser beam about a vertical axis. If the mirror is not self-leveling, it is provided with visually readable level vials and manually adjustable screws for orienting the projector. A staff carried by the operator is equipped with a movable sensor, which can detect the laser beam and gives a signal when the sensor is in line with the beam (usually an <b>audible</b> <b>beep).</b> The position of the sensor on the graduated staff, also known as a grade rod, or story pole, allows comparison of elevations between different points on the terrain. Most laser levels are used in the construction industry.|$|E
50|$|SunPass {{portable}} (hard case) transponders can {{be transferred}} between vehicles without damaging the transponder. The original transponders operate on battery power to communicate with toll barrier equipment and to operate audible and visual indications of toll paid, toll low, battery low, and so forth. The Type IIe transponder, {{an updated version of}} the SunPass portable, requires no batteries, but does not have indicator lights or <b>audible</b> <b>beeps.</b> SunPass portable transponders are sold for $19.99 to customers who prefer the portability offered by the transponder. Customers must establish a minimum opening account of $10.00 to fund their tolls. Unused toll fees are only refunded if the user closes the account or takes advantage of a money-back guarantee.|$|R
5000|$|Beat {{frequency}} oscillator (BFO) - This is an electronic oscillator {{which is only}} found in communications receivers, used in the reception of radiotelegraph (CW) or single-sideband modulation (SSB). It produces a fixed frequency offset from the IF which is mixed with the IF in the demodulator. The IF and BFO frequencies produce a heterodyne (beat) in the audio range which sounds like a musical tone in the speaker. In CW the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] of the Morse code are <b>audible</b> as <b>beeps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Metox was the German {{answer to}} the British radar. Metox sets {{received}} the transmitted pulses from the ASV and rendered them as <b>audible</b> <b>beeps.</b> It enjoyed the usual advantage of radar detectors over radar in that the signal is direct and only had to travel one way whereas the radar has to detect the very weak reflection from the submarine. Most radars {{increase the number of}} pulses and decrease the width of the pulses when switched to a shorter range, the shorter pulse widths allow the radar to look at closer objects. The Metox exploited the fact that once the radar operator changed the range indication from 36 mi to 9 mi, the pulse repetition frequency of the radar's transmitter doubled. Radar cannot detect any reflections returned earlier than half a pulse width so when the U-boat was closer than 9 mi the operator would change to the shorter scale. If the Metox set started beeping at twice the rate, the U-boat knew that they had been detected. By the time the aircraft was close enough to the U-boat's position to energise the Leigh light, the U-boat was well under the water. As a bonus, the Metox set would also provide warning in excess of visual range in daylight.|$|R

Following insertion of the pre-lubricated balloon into the endometrial cavity, the treatment trigger is depressed for 5  s ending with an <b>audible</b> <b>beep</b> indicating that the system has been activated and the treatment cycle initiated. A 15 -s balloon leak check is automatically carried out following which the hot liquid is pumped through the catheter into the balloon.|$|E

40|$|A {{proposed}} wireless-communication and data-processing {{system would}} exploit {{recent advances in}} radio-frequency identification devices (RFIDs) and software to establish information lifelines between firefighters in a burning building and a fire chief at a control station near but outside the building. The system would enable identification of trails that firefighters and others could follow {{to escape from the}} building, including identification of new trails should previously established trails become blocked. The system would include a transceiver unit and a computer at the control station, portable transceiver units carried by the firefighters in the building, and RFID tags that the firefighters would place at multiple locations as they move into and through the building (see figure). Each RFID tag, having a size of the order of a few centimeters, would include at least standard RFID circuitry and possibly sensors for measuring such other relevant environmental parameters as temperature, levels of light and sound, concentration of oxygen, concentrations of hazardous chemicals in smoke, and/or levels of nuclear radiation. The RFID tags would be activated and interrogated by the firefighters and control-station transceivers. Preferably, RFID tags would be configured {{to communicate with each other}} and with the firefighters units and the control station in an ordered sequence, with built-in redundancy. In a typical scenario, as firefighters moved through a building, they would scatter many RFID tags into smoke-obscured areas by use of a compressed-air gun. Alternatively or in addition, they would mark escape trails by dropping RFID tags at such points of interest as mantraps, hot spots, and trail waypoints. The RFID tags could be of different types, operating at different frequencies to identify their functions, and possibly responding by emitting <b>audible</b> <b>beeps</b> when activated by signals transmitted by transceiver units carried by nearby firefighters...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "heterodyne" [...] or [...] "beat" [...] {{receiver}} has a {{local oscillator}} {{that produces a}} radio signal adjusted to be close in frequency to the incoming signal being received. When the two signals are mixed, a [...] "beat" [...] frequency equal {{to the difference between}} the two frequencies is created. By adjusting the local oscillator frequency correctly, the beat frequency is in the audio range, and can be heard as a tone in the receiver's earphones whenever the transmitter signal is present. Thus the Morse code [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] are <b>audible</b> as <b>beeping</b> sounds. This technique is still used in radio telegraphy, the local oscillator now being called the beat frequency oscillator or BFO. Fessenden coined the word heterodyne from the Greek roots hetero- [...] "different", and dyn- [...] "power" [...] (cf. δύναμις or dunamis).|$|R
40|$|Coaches {{and sport}} {{scientists}} {{tend to agree}} that it is important for team sports players to be fast. This view is based on the notion that a fast player has a greater chance of getting to the ball or moving into space before a slower opponent, especially during critical periods of a match such as goal- or try-scoring opportunities. There is also evidence from soccer that shows that sprinting speed increases with the standard of the player (Dunbar and Power, 1997 : In Science and Football III, edited by T. Reilly, J. Bangsbo and M. Hughes. London: E & FN Spon), such that professionals are faster than semi-professionals and amateurs. Although the value of speed is recognized for these reasons, there is very little information available on the changes in sprint speed during team sport play. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the changes in peak sprint speed over the course of a prolonged high-intensity intermittent exercise protocol that simulated team sport play. After receiving ethical approval from the relevant body at the Central Queensland University, five male recreational team sport players (age 20 + 3 years, body mass 75 + 12 kg, maximal oxygen uptake 56 + 7 ml×kg 71 ×min 71; mean+s) provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Drawing on several published time and motion studies, an activity profile representative of team sport play was developed. The activity profile entailed six 15 min periods of intermittent standing (18 % of total time, 0 % of maximal speed), walking (37 % of total time, 20 % of maximal speed), jogging (24 % of total time, 35 % of maximal speed), running (14 % of total time, 50 % of maximal speed), fast running (4 % of total time, 70 % of maximal speed) and sprinting (3 % of total time, 100 % of maximal speed). In total, there were 1866 s sprints and 1863 s sprints over the 90 min protocol. A nonmotorized treadmill (Woodway) was instrumented to allow the measurement of speed and distance. Data were collected at 5000 Hz using an AMLAB data acquisition system and then averaged to provide 20 Hz samples. The players followed the activity profile on a monitor placed at eye level that displayed a target speed together with their current speed. A series of computergenerated <b>audible</b> <b>beeps</b> and verbal commands was used to instruct the players to change speed. The players completed two 45 min periods seperated by an interval of 15 min. The mean and standard deviation peak sprint speeds for each of the six 15 min periods were calculated and analysed by repeated-measures analysis of variance with contrast analysis. The players covered a mean distance of 10, 196 + 403 m; mean peak sprint speed was 24. 2 + 0. 8 km×h 71 over the 90 min protocol. The mean peak sprint speed for each of the 15 min periods was 25. 3 + 1. 0, 24. 7 + 0. 8, 24. 6 + 1. 2, 24. 1 + 0. 9, 23. 3 + 0. 7 and 23. 3 + 1. 0 km×h 71, respectively. Mean peak sprint speed decreased from the first to each of the second (2. 4 %), fourth (4. 7 %), fifth (7. 9 %) and sixth (7. 9 %) 15 min periods (all P 50. 05). The results of this study suggest that peak sprint speed decreases progressively during prolonged high-intensity intermittent exercise. This could result from a progressive reduction in phosphocreatine concentration and/or the glycogenolytic rate...|$|R
