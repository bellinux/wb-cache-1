50|$|In {{all types}} of {{aircraft}} used, the weather officer sat in the nose where the bombardier {{would be in a}} combat airplane. The glazing gave good views of the sky, and, when flying at low, the sea. The weather officer's task was to observe and record both the visible conditions outside the airplane and the indications on the instruments. The psychrometer and <b>aerograph</b> indicated the relative humidity. The free air thermometer and <b>aerograph</b> gave the air temperature. The radio altimeter gave the altitude, and the pressure altimeter and <b>aerograph</b> gave the air pressure. By using both altimeters, the weather officer determined and recorded the air pressure at standard altitudes, such as 5,000 and 10,000 feet. Wind speed and direction were determined from the aircraft's drift off course. By watching for sharp changes in temperature and humidity on the <b>aerograph</b> chart, the weather officer noted the strength and locations of cold fronts. By having the airplane fly along a constant pressure altitude, the weather officer could map an isobaric surface.|$|E

30|$|Seeds were inoculated 1  h before sowing by {{thoroughly}} coating them {{to provide}} a final concentration of 1.6  ×  105 cells seed− 1. For leaf-spray inoculation, an <b>aerograph</b> atomizer was employed to mimic the action of a spraying apparatus. The soil surface was covered with aluminum foil to prevent the inoculant reaching it. The final volume of liquid for leaf-spray inoculation was 1  mL (water + inoculant) per pot containing a single plant, and inoculants were diluted with sterile distilled water at 1 : 1000 (v:v) for spraying, to achieve an application rate of 1.6  ×  105 cells plant− 1. For leaf spray of metabolites, bacterial exudate corresponding to the same cell concentration as the seed inoculant used for leaf spray was used, with the application of 1  mL per plant corresponding to 1.6  ×  105 cells plant− 1. Foliar-spray inoculations of pots containing maize plants were performed 7  days after transplanting.|$|E

Here it is worth mentioning that although the dilution with water might not be ideal in terms of osmotic effect for the bacterium, we wanted to follow what the farmer does under field conditons, where he mixes the inoculant with water. For leaf and soil surface spray inoculation, an <b>aerograph</b> atomizer was employed to mimic the action of a spraying equipment. For leaf spray inoculation, the soil surface was covered with aluminum foil in order to avoid that the inoculant reached the soil. For soil surface spray inoculation, plant shoots were covered with plastic bags to make sure that the inoculant reached only the soil surface.|$|E
40|$|Five gas chromatographic liquid phases (25 % Carbowax 20 M plus 4 % H 3 PO 4, 17. 5 % {{dioctyl sebacate}} plus 7. 5 % sebacic acid, 17. 5 % dioctyl sebacate plus 7. 5 % docosanoic acid, 5 % Tween 80, and 20 % LAC- 296 [poly (diethylene glycol adipate) ] plus 2 % H 3 PO 4) were studied {{with respect to}} their utility in the {{separation}} and quantitation of steam-volatile organic acids commonly produced in fermentation. Optimal operating conditions and column stability for routine analysis were established. An <b>Aerograph</b> Hy-Fi gas chromatograph was used for all work, except the studies with Tween 80 in which an <b>Aerograph</b> A- 90 -C was employed. Chromatographic traces are presented of volatile fatty acid analyses with each of the liquid phases. Complete separation of all isomers of the fatty acids from C 2 to C 5 was accomplished by the Carbowax 20 M plus H 3 PO 4, dioctyl sebacate plus sebacic acid, and dioctyl sebacate plus docosanoic acid columns. The latter two liquid phases were extremely unstable and proved to be unsatisfactory for analysis of aqueous samples. A column of Carbowax 20 M + H 3 PO 4 separated steam-volatile organic acids completely. The volatile fatty acid isomers were separated by 5 % Tween 80 somewhat less completely, and the peak shapes were not as sharp and symmetrical as that desired for good quantitative work. LAC- 296 (20 %) plus 2 % H 3 PO 4 proved to be the most satisfactory of the liquid phases for routine analysis of deproteinated in vitro rumen fermentation media. The column has been used for routine analysis of rumen fermentation fluid and in vitro rumen incubation fluid. All the organic acids from C 2 to C 5, except isobutyric, could be quantitated with this column. Stability of the column with the aqueous solutions was extremely good. The standard deviation of the analysis of each volatile acid component in a fermentation fluid was less than 0. 5 molar per cent. The short-chain organic acids (C 2 to C 5) were shown to be extremely stable in aqueous solution for as long as 6 months after preparation for gas chromatographic analysis by protein precipitation with metaphosphoric acid-H 2 SO 4 and refrigeration at 4 C in stoppered tubes...|$|E
40|$|A project {{student in}} our {{laboratory}} obtained inexplicable results whilst using the acetylene reduction method (Stewart et al., 1967; Hardy et al., 1968). All her data showed consistently high values for ethylene when {{a range of}} values had been expected. It was noted that during this experiment, which required transfer of cultures using aseptic procedures, she was using a blue, but partially vented, Bunsen flame. When the experiment was repeated using a fully vented Bunsen flame during aseptic transfer, the predicted range of data was ob-tained. This led to {{an investigation into the}} transfer of ethylene during aseptic procedures and the implications for acetylene reduction assays. METHODS The tops were removed from Bijou bottles (7 cm 3, with tops drilled to expose rubber liners to facilitate transfer of gas with a syringe) and the necks of the bottles were heated in a Bunsen flame using a standard aseptic procedure. The tops were immediately replaced. During exposure to the flame the bottles were held at 45 " to avoid spillage of contents and to prevent abnormal amounts of gas entering the bottles. Ethylene was measured by injecting 1 cm 3 of the atmosphere from the bottle into a Varian <b>Aerograph</b> Series 1400 gas chromatograph.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Many {{different}} {{strains of}} yeast have been isolated from the natural microflora on fruits. It {{has been known for}} some time that these {{strains of yeast}} have distinct fermentation characteristics and, when used in the production of wine, impart these characteristics to the wine. These characteristics may be evidenced in the flavor or aroma of the wine, the speed of the fermentation, the amount of ethanol produced and many other ways. It was reasoned that these fermentation characteristics were involved with or were a result of the metabolic system of a particular yeast strain. Since fermentation products result from the metabolic pathways, these products were studied in the hope that {{a better understanding of the}} fermentation products would lead to a better understanding of the metabolic pathways and, in turn, of the fermentation characteristics of yeast strains. The fermentations were conducted on blackberries with four strains of yeast, chosen because of their different fermentation characteristics: Saccharomyces oviformis, Saccharomyces bayanus, Saccharomyces ellipsoideus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ethyl chloride was used to extract the wines after the fermentations were completed. The solvent was removed and the sample concentrated on a low temperature distillation apparatus, after which it was analyzed using gas chromatography. The gas chromatograph employed was a Wilken's <b>Aerograph</b> Hy-Fi with a hydrogen flame ionization detector. An eight foot X 1 / 8 inch stainless steel column packed with five percent Carbowax 400 on 80 / 100 mesh Celite 545 was used for the analyses. Peak heights were determined by measuring the recorder response (in millivolts), and the percent contribution of each peak was calculated with the greatest percent deviation within a sample being less than four percent. The initial five peaks, excluding ethanol and the solvent, accounted for approximately 99 percent of the sample and demonstrated significant differences between the yeast strains. The later peaks also aided in the differentiation although not in as pronounced a manner. A tentative identification was made, using the enrichment technique, of peaks two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, ten, thirteen and fourteen. These were believed to be ethyl acetate, ethanol, propanol, isobutanol, butanol, isoamyl alcohol and active amyl alcohol, glycerol, 2, 3 -butylene glycol or ethyl octanoate, linalool and ethyl decanoate...|$|E
40|$|Tubular SOFC {{have the}} {{advantage}} over planar SOFC of the low temperature sealing and more resistance to thermal shock. On the other hand the volumetric power density of tubular Fuel Cells goes with the inverse of the tube diameter which added to the faster warm-up kinetics makes low diameter tubular SOFC favorable for low power applications. Anode supported tubular SOFC of 3 mm diameter and 150 mm length with YSZ electrolyte were fabricated and tested by V-I measurements using H 2 -Ar (5, 10, 100 vol%) as fuel and air for the cathode. The NiO-YSZ tubes of about 400 μm thickness were produced by hydrostatic pressure and then coated with an YSZ film of 15 - 20 μm. The electrolyte was deposited using a manual <b>aerograph.</b> After sintering either Pt paste or LSF (with YSZ or SDC) coatings of about 20 - 50 μm thickness were deposited for the cathode. The OCV of the cells were excellent, {{very close to the}} expected Nernst law prediction indicating that there were not gas leaks. The maximun electrical power of the cell was near to 500 mW/cm 2 at 850 ºC operation temperature. Complex impedance measurements of the cells were performed {{in order to determine the}} resistance of the different cell components. La principal ventaja de las SOFC tubulares frente a las planares es el sellado de la cámara anódica y catódica a bajas temperaturas. Además la densidad de energía volumétrica de las pilas tubulares es inversamente proporcional al diámetro del tubo, que añadido a los tiempos cortos de encendido y apagado hacen que las mini-tubulares sean interesantes para usos de baja potencia. Se han fabricado y caracterizado SOFC tubulares soportadas en ánodo de 3 mm de diámetro y de 150 mm de longitud, 400 μm de espesor, con electrolito de YSZ depositado por spray de 15 - 20 μm. Los tubos de NiO-YSZ son producidos por prensado isostático. La caracterización eléctrica se ha realizado empleando H 2 -Ar como combustible anódico (5, 10, 100 %vol) y aire para el cátodo. Los cátodos empleados son pintura de Pt o capas de LSF (con YSZ o SDC) de entre 20 - 50 μm. Los OCV medidos ajustan con la predicción prevista de la ley de Nernst lo que indica que las capas de YSZ son estancas al paso de gas. Las curvas I-V muestran una corriente eléctrica máxima próxima a 500 mW/cm 2 operando a 850 ºC. También se han realizado medidas de impedancia compleja para determinar la resistencia de los diversos componentes de la pila...|$|E
