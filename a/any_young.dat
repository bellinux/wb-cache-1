In another book, the Wilis are said to be jilted young women who have died and become vampires. This is assumed to be the reason that they hate men.|$|E

Rovers are not necessarily adult leaders of Scout Troops, although there is often some overlap. The Rover section has historically been open to young men and women, even prior to Cubbing and Scouting being opened to girls.|$|E

5|$|Golden jackals are {{abundant}} in valleys and beside rivers and their tributaries, canals, lakes, and seashores. They are rare in foothills and low mountains, and they avoid waterless deserts and snow areas. The golden jackal {{is a social}} species, the basic social unit of which consists of a breeding pair and <b>any</b> <b>young</b> offspring. It is very adaptable, {{with the ability to}} exploit food ranging from fruit and insects to small ungulates. They will attack domestic fowl and domestic mammals up to the size of domestic water buffalo calves. The jackal's competitors are the red fox, wolf, jungle cat, forest wildcat, and the raccoon in the Caucasus, and the steppe wildcat in Central Asia. In Europe, jackals will not occupy the same areas as wolves, with the jackal's expansion being attributed to their occupying those areas where wolves are few or non-existent.|$|E

In March Melville published in the Albany Microscope two polemical letters about issues in the debating societies he was engaged in; it is not entirely clear what the polemic was about.

25|$|The {{passenger}} pigeon was hunted in Northern Michigan {{as a source}} of food, but by the 1870s, a combination of increased population and economic scarcity led to over-hunting and eventual extinction. The massive flocks of {{passenger pigeon}}s stopped darkening the skies of Northern Michigan, especially after the last large scale nestings and subsequent slaughters of millions of birds in 1874 and 1878. By this time, large nestings only took place in the north, around the Great Lakes. The last large nesting was in Petoskey, Michigan, in 1878 (following one in Pennsylvania a few days earlier), where 50,000 birds were killed each day for nearly five months. The surviving adults attempted a second nesting at new sites, but were killed by professional hunters before they had a chance to raise <b>any</b> <b>young.</b> Scattered nestings were reported into the 1880s, but the birds were now weary, and commonly abandoned their nests if persecuted.|$|E

25|$|Another myth of {{the origin}} of the games is the story of Pelops, a local Olympian hero. The story of Pelops begins with Oenomaus, the king of Pisa, Greece, who had a {{beautiful}} daughter named Hippodamia. According to an oracle, the king would be killed by her husband. Therefore, he decreed that <b>any</b> <b>young</b> man who wanted to marry his daughter was required to drive away with her in his chariot, and Oenomaus would follow in another chariot, and spear the suitor if he caught up with them. Now, the king's chariot horses were a present from the god Poseidon and were therefore supernaturally fast. Pelops was a very handsome young man and the king's daughter fell in love with him. Before the race, she persuaded her father's charioteer Myrtilus to replace the bronze axle pins of the king's chariot with wax ones. Naturally, during the race, the wax melted and the king fell from his chariot and was killed. At the same time, the king's palace was struck by lightning and reduced to ashes, save for one wooden pillar that was revered in the Altis for centuries, and stood near what was to be the site of the temple of Zeus. Pelops was proclaimed the winner and married Hippodamia. After his victory, Pelops organized chariot races as thanksgiving to the gods and as funeral games in honor of King Oenomaus, in order to be purified of his death. It was from this funeral race held at Olympia that the beginnings of the Olympic Games were inspired. Pelops became a great king, a local hero, and he gave his name to the Peloponnese.|$|E

500|$|Currently {{as many as}} 50,000 {{visitors}} {{gather on}} the last Wednesday in July to watch mounted riders bring the Virginia herd from Assateague and swim them across the channel to Chincoteague Island. The swim takes five-ten minutes, with both the rider and the observers on hand to assist horses, especially foals, who may {{have a hard time}} with the crossing. Before the swim, the herd is evaluated and mares in the late stages of pregnancy and those with very young foals are removed from the herd to be trailered between the islands. During the swim, some lactating mares become affected with hypocalcemia, which is treated by on-site veterinarians. Larger foals are auctioned the next day and the majority of the herd, including <b>any</b> <b>young</b> foals, are returned to Assateague on Friday. As of 2015, the highest price paid for a pony was $25,000 and the lowest price was $500.

Although Beiste's physical appearance {{was used as}} comedy in the episode, Jones was not offended; she called it hysterical, said [...] "it serves a purpose for the message" [...] and hoped [...] "maybe it will make people think outside of the show." [...] Murphy intended her storyline to highlight the fact that bullying can be damaging without necessarily being overt. He stated: [...] "Th episode is completely about accountability.

500|$|Particularly {{after his}} fastball slowed, Young relied upon his control.

The curve is merely an accessory to control." [...] In addition to his exceptional control, Young was also a workhorse who avoided injury. For nineteen consecutive years, from 1891 through 1909, Young was in his leagues' top ten for innings pitched; in fourteen of the seasons, he was in the top five. Not until 1900, a decade into his career, did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games. By habit, Young restricted his practice throws in spring training. [...] "I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it", said Young, [...] "and there wasn't any use wasting them." [...] Young once described his approach before a game: ...|$|E
