25|$|The {{third most}} {{abundant}} constituent of the Uranian atmosphere is methane , {{the presence of}} which has been known for some time {{as a result of the}} ground-based spectroscopic observations. Methane possesses prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared, making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour. Below the methane cloud deck at 1.3bar methane molecules account for about 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction; about 10 to 30 times that found in the Sun. The mixing ratio is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to the extremely low temperature at the tropopause, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out. Methane appears to be undersaturated in the upper troposphere above the clouds having a partial pressure of only 30% of the saturated vapor pressure there. The concentration of less volatile compounds such as <b>ammonia,</b> <b>water</b> and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere is poorly known. However, as with methane, their abundances are probably greater than solar values by a factor of at least 20 to 30, and possibly by a factor of a few hundred.|$|E

60|$|I {{turn to the}} {{experimental}} side to see what evidence we have there.

That, nobody has done as yet, and I suspect it will be a long while before anybody does do it. But the thing is by no means so impossible as it looks; for the researches of modern chemistry have shown us--I won't say the road towards it, but, if I may so say, they have shown the finger-post pointing to the road that may lead to it.|$|E

50|$|There is {{debate about}} the {{effectiveness}} of methane and other hydrocarbons as a solvent for life compared to water or <b>ammonia.</b> <b>Water</b> is a stronger solvent than the hydrocarbons, enabling easier transport of substances in a cell. However, water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the threat of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way. Also, the water molecule's tendency to form strong hydrogen bonds can interfere with internal hydrogen bonding in complex organic molecules. Life with a hydrocarbon solvent could make more use of hydrogen bonds within its biomolecules. Moreover, the strength of hydrogen bonds within biomolecules would be appropriate to a low-temperature biochemistry.|$|E

5000|$|The use of {{the term}} kompot or compote refers euphemistically to kompot, a {{traditional}} compote-like dessert popular in Central and Eastern European countries made of stewed fruit, spices, and sugar. The so-called kompot method of making a crude opiate [...] "cocktail" [...] intended for injection involves stewing the pods of the opium poppy in nearly boiling water and an acid, and using the strained liquid (essentially like kompot is produced from the raw ingredients). However, in 1976 two Polish students from Gdańsk discovered a simple way of making it by extracting opiate alkaloids from poppy straw by using ion exchange resin, acetone, <b>ammonia</b> <b>water</b> and a few other chemicals used in the last step of production. In this method, opium poppy pods and stems are boiled in water for a few hours without adding acid, and then filtered. Strongly acidic ion exchange resin is then added. The resin is filtered and the opiates are recovered with the addition of <b>ammonia</b> <b>water.</b> The resulting liquid is evaporated using a chemical condenser, then when dry (it is then called glazura - glaze) it is acetylated using acetic anhydride in an anhydrous environment of a non-polar solvent, for example toluene, diethyl ether, chloroform, or most commonly acetone. After acetylation, the solvent is evaporated to remove the acetic anhydride, and finally water is added. The amount of water added depends on the amount of plant material used {{in the beginning of the}} process, most often 30 milliliters per kilogram of dry plant material. Although the drug is primarily intended for intravenous injection, kompot extraction as described here produces an end product containing residual plant matter, waste chemicals, impure water, and other contaminants, making this dangerous substance to inject since such impurities can lead to abscesses or anaphylactic shock.|$|E
