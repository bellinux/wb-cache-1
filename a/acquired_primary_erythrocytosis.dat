40|$|The role of serum {{erythropoietin}} {{levels in}} diagno-sis and classification of erythrocytosis/ polycythemiaHaematologica 2005; 90 :(4) e 44 -e 45 I read {{with great interest}} the recent paper of Gordeuk et al. 1 on congenital polycythemias/erythrocytoses, in which a diagnostic algorithm based on serum erythropoi-etin (Epo) concentration in non-phlebotomized patients is presented. As a first step the authors propose classifica-tion into <b>primary</b> <b>erythrocytosis</b> (increased red cell mass due to intrinsically abnormal bone marrow erythro-poiesis) versus secondary erythrocytosis (excessive ery-throid proliferation in response to pathological events outside the progenitor cells) according to whether the serum Epo level is below or above 5 IU/L. Primary erythrocytoses are further distinguished into primary familial and congenital polycythemia (PFCP) and polycythemia vera (PV), the latter being acquired but occasionally occurring in a familial or juvenile context, whereas secondary congenital polycythemias can be sub-divided into disorders of hypoxia sensing, conditions of increased affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen (hemoglobin mutants, 2, 3 -bisphosphoglycerate deficiency, methemo-globinemia) and congenital cyanotic heart or lung dis-ease. The use of a unique clear-cut serum Epo level as classification criterion for primary versus secondary ery-throcytosis, however, does not correspond to observa-tions {{in a number of}} studies evaluating the discriminating value of serum Epo levels in polycythemic patients. Low serum Epo values have high specificity and moderate sen-sitivity for diagnosis of primary polycythemia compared with other erythrocytoses (Table 1). Table.

40|$|Secondary erythrocytosis of cyanotic {{congenital}} {{heart disease}} (CCHD) is pathologically different from <b>primary</b> <b>erythrocytosis</b> of polycythemia vera (PV). An association between elevated hematocrit and thrombosis {{has been established in}} PV patients, and treatment guidelines recommend maintaining hematocrit < 45 %. Although an association between elevated hematocrit and thrombosis has not been established in CCHD and secondary erythrocytosis, the current clinical practice is to phlebotomize these patients to hematocrit < 65 %. We report a 21 -year-old woman with CCHD who presented with symptomatic erythrocytosis with numbness and tingling with hemoglobin 25. 2  g/dl and hematocrit 75. 8 %. Her symptoms resolved with IV hydration. Other factors, including dehydration and iron deficiency, may precipitate hyperviscosity symptoms. The treatment is volume replacement and low-dose iron therapy, not phlebotomy. Repeated phlebotomy causes iron deficiency with microcytic erythrocytes, which increases the whole blood viscosity and, therefore, can potentially accentuate rather than decrease the risk for a cerebrovascular accident...|$|R

40|$|Erythropoietin {{regulates the}} {{proliferation}} and differentiation of erythroid precursor cells. Its effect is {{mediated by the}} erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), {{a member of a}} large family of cytokine receptors. The EPOR gene has recently been cloned, sequenced, and characterized. As shown experimentally, its intracellular C-terminal part contains a domain exerting negative control on erythropoiesis. Here we describe a G to A transition in nucleotide 6002 of the EPOR gene that converts a TGG codon for tryptophan into a TAG stop codon, predicting the truncation of the 70 C-terminal amino acids of the EPOR molecule. The mutation occurs in heterozygous form in the germ-line DNA of members of a large kindred in which <b>primary</b> <b>erythrocytosis</b> is segregating as a mild autosomal dominant trait. The mutation cosegregates with the disease phenotype in all 29 affected family members studied; it occurs in no unaffected family members or unrelated controls. This appears to be an example of a human condition caused by an EPOR mutation. Striking similarities exist between the human phenotype described here and phenotypes of cell lines expressing similarly truncated EPOR molecules produced experimentally. By analogy with these in vitro studies, one can hypothesize that the truncated EPOR molecules are activated by suppression of phosphorylation leading to loss of the down-modulation exerted by intact EPOR molecules. Experimental modifications of the EPOR gene may eventually have therapeutic applications...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{document}} and analyze the ossicular chain preservation rate in patients affected by <b>acquired</b> <b>primary</b> cholesteatoma with epitympanic involvement and with preoperative intact ossicular chain. Study Design: A retrospective case series in a tertiary university referral center. Methods: From January 2006 to February 2010, at the Otolaryngology Department of the University Hospital of Modena, 68 patients affected by <b>acquired</b> <b>primary</b> cholesteatoma with attic involvement underwent exclusive endoscopic transcanal tympanoplasty. In April 2010, we performed a retrospective chart and video review of these patients. Patients in whom the ossicular chain was found to be intact and not involved by the pathology {{at the beginning of the}} operation were included in the study. A cholesteatoma staging was introduced based on tympanic subsite involvement by pathology. Results: Out of 68 patients affected by <b>acquired</b> <b>primary</b> cholesteatoma and who underwent exclusive endoscopic transcanal tympanoplasty, 23 had intraoperative integrity of the ossicular chain (17 male and 6 female subjects; mean age, 40 yr) and were included in the study. An inverse correlation was found between number of subsites involved and chain preservation (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, r = - 1; p = 0. 017). Medial attic involvement was the factor that most negatively influenced the likelihood of chain preservation. Conclusion: Middle ear endoscopic techniques may increase the likelihood of ossicular chain preservation during cholesteatoma surgery. Medial attic involvement and a high number of subsites involved represent the most significant negative factors for chain preservation. The rate of residual disease requires more thorough evaluation in the future to validate the results...|$|R

We describe a rare case of a small primary iris cyst in a 39 -year-old patient, associated with unusual signs of irritation. Ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrated iris stromal cyst measuring 3 × 2 mm. A neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser cystotomy was engaged as the least invasive treatment approach. However, the cyst recurred soon after repeated laser treatment and sector iridectomy with excision of the cyst was performed. Five years after surgery {{there was no evidence}} of recurrence. Conclusion. Although more benign clinical course of primary stromal iris cyst is generally assumed in adults as compared to children, complete cyst removal seems to be mandatory for preventing cyst recurrence regardless of the cyst size or patient age.

The frequency of occurrence in pediatric transplant recipients was 4 % (10 / 253), while in adults it was 0. 8 % (10 / 1214) (P <. 0005). The frequency of LPS in adults declined after 1983 coincidental with the introduction of cyclosporine monitoring. However there was no apparent decline of LPS in children. We describe these ten pediatric cases and one additional case of LPS in a child who received her transplant before 1981. The frequency of EBV infection in 92 pediatric liver recipients was 63 %. Of these subjects, 49 % were sero-negative and 77 % of those <b>acquired</b> <b>primary</b> infection. Of 11 cases of pediatric EBV-associated LPS, 10 were in children who had primary infection shortly before or after transplantation. These results reinforce the impor-tance of primary EBV infection in producing LPS, which was previously shown in adults. Children are at greater risk because {{they are more likely to}} be seronegative for EBV and to <b>acquire</b> <b>primary</b> infection. Three clinical types of LPS were recognized in children. The first (5 cases) was a self-limited mononucleo-sislike syndrome.
