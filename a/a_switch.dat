5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} can be {{seen from}} a variety of viewpoints. A synthesized research definition of cognitive flexibility is <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> in thinking, whether that is specifically based on <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> in rules or broadly based on a need to switch one’s previous beliefs or thoughts to new situations. Moreover, it refers to simultaneously considering multiple aspects of thought at once, whether they be two aspects of a specific object, or many aspects of a complex situation. Other terms for and components of cognitive flexibility include mental flexibility, mental set shifting, cognitive shifting, task switching/shifting, and attention switching/shifting.|$|E

Some puzzles require Kratos to move a box on top of <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> (thus activating it), or moving a box {{to use it as}} a jumping-off point to reach a pathway unreachable with normal jumping.

5|$|Although the {{full-size}} mock-up inspection in April 1949 {{was generally}} favorable, range again became a concern since the J40s and early model J57s had excessive fuel consumption. Despite talk of another revision of specifications {{or even a}} full design competition among aircraft manufacturers, General LeMay, {{now in charge of}} Strategic Air Command, insisted that performance should not be compromised due to delays in engine development. In a final attempt to increase range, Boeing created the larger 464-67, stating that once in production, the range could be further increased in subsequent modifications. Following several direct interventions by LeMay, Boeing was awarded a production contract for thirteen B-52As and seventeen detachable reconnaissance pods on 14 February 1951. The last major design change—also at General LeMay's insistence—was <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> from the B-47 style tandem seating to a more conventional side-by-side cockpit, which increased the effectiveness of the copilot and reduced crew fatigue. Both XB-52 prototypes featured the original tandem seating arrangement with a framed bubble-type canopy.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, Nova {{decided to}} launch a British reprint of the American {{magazine}} Science Fiction Adventures, under the same title. The British Science Fiction Adventures lasted until May 1963, when it was felled by declining sales. New Worlds, Nova's flagship title, and Science Fantasy were also suffering from poor sales, with circulation estimated at about 5,000, though <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> from bimonthly to a monthly schedule was also considered that year for Science Fantasy. In September Nova decided to close down both remaining titles, and {{in preparation for the}} change Carnell signed a contract in December 1963 to edit an original anthology series, New Writings in SF, for publisher Dennis Dobson. Readers' responses to news of the planned demise of the magazines included a letter from Michael Moorcock, published in the April 1964 New Worlds, asking how the British market would now be able to train writers to sell to the higher-paying U.S. magazines.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis, <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic tap water.|$|E
5|$|North of the station, tracks 7 and 6 {{merge into}} one track (with <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> from track 7 to track 8), tracks 5 through 2 merge into another track, and tracks 1 and 8 stay separate, {{so that there}} is a four-tracked {{structure}} when the BMT West End Line and BMT Sea Beach Line cross the Coney Island Creek. Before the structure crosses the creek, all four tracks have switches that connect the tracks to each other, before the West End and Sea Beach Lines split. Tracks from these lines then lead into Coney Island Yard. South of the station, tracks 4, 5, and 6 stay separate from the other tracks (with a pair of switches between tracks 5 and 6) and tracks 1, 2, and 3 merge and have a diamond crossover with track 4. Tracks 3 and 4 (the Brighton Line tracks) are above tracks 5 and 6 (the Culver Line tracks) at this point.|$|E
