In free-ranging animals, ammonia treatment induced {{a brief period of}} precoma (10 - 15 min) that progressed into deep, anesthetic coma lasting for several hours and was associated with a high mortality. In paralyzed, artificially ventilated animals that were lightly anesthetized with nitrous oxide, acute <b>ammonia</b> <b>intoxication</b> caused major disturbances of cerebral carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolism that correlated in time with the change in functional state. At 10 min after injection (precoma), the concentrations of most glycolytic intermediates were increased, as was the lactate/pyruvate ratio. Citrate declined, despite a twofold rise in pyruvate, suggesting that the conversion of pyruvate to citrate had been impaired. Concentrations of phosphocreatine, and of the putative neurotransmitters, glutamate and aspartate, declined during precoma, but the concentrations of the adenine nucleotides in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and brain stem remained within normal limits. At 60 min after injection (coma), ATP declined in all regions of brain; the reduction in total high-energy phosphates was most notable in the brain stem. The findings indicate that cerebral dysfunction in chronic, relapsing <b>ammonia</b> <b>intoxication</b> is not due to primary energy failure. Rather, it is suggested that ammonia-induced depletion of glutamic and aspartic acids, and inhibition of the malate-asparate hydrogen shuttle are the dominant neurochemical lesions...|$|E

Patients with these conditions have extremely high blood and CSF levels of ammonia, frequently much higher than in hepatic coma.

40|$|Acute <b>ammonia</b> <b>intoxication</b> {{leads to}} rapid death, which is {{prevented}} by blocking N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The subsequent mechanisms leading to death remain unclear. Brain edema seems an important step. The {{aim of this}} work was to {{study the effects of}} acute <b>ammonia</b> <b>intoxication</b> on different cerebral parameters in vivo using magnetic resonance and to assess which effects are mediated by NMDA receptors activation. To assess edema induction, we injected rats with ammonium acetate and measured apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in 16 brain areas. We also analyzed the effects on T 1, T 2, and T 2 * maps and whether these effects are prevented by blocking NMDA receptors. The effects of acute <b>ammonia</b> <b>intoxication</b> are different in different brain areas. T 1 relaxation time is reduced in eight areas. T 2 relaxation time is reduced only in ventral thalamus and globus pallidus. ADC values increased in hippocampus, caudate-putamen, substantia nigra and cerebellar cortex, reflecting vasogenic edema. ADC decreased in hypothalamus, reflecting cytotoxic edema. Myo-inositol increased in cerebellum and substantia nigra, reflecting vasogenic edema. N-acetyl-aspartate decreased in cerebellum, reflecting neuronal damage. Changes in N-acetyl-aspartate, T 1 and T 2 are prevented by blocking NMDA receptors with MK- 801 while changes in ADC or myo-inositol (induction of edema) are not. © 2007 The Authors.

40|$|EDITORIAL SYNOPSIS The {{relation}} between <b>ammonia</b> <b>intoxication</b> and liver disease is not clear. Ammonia {{appears to be}} relatively non-toxic to normal individuals, whereas some patients with liver disease appear to be exquisitely sensitive to dietary protein, ammonia-releasing substances, and ammonium salts. In an attempt to elucidate this relationship the intravenous LD 50 ofammonium chloride was determined in both normal mice and in those with liver disease produced {{by a variety of}} means. Parenchymal damage was created by acute and chronic carbon tetrachloride intoxication, a low-protein, lipotrope-deficient diet, and mouse hepatitis virus. Mice in which the portal vein had been partially ligated and those infected with Schistosoma mansoni developed portal-systemic collateral circulation. Groups of these mice were placed on high-protein diets and ammonia drinking water for periods as long as two months. A combination of both parenchymal damage and col-lateral circulation was induced in mice either by bile duct ligation or by a combination of schisto-somiasis and acute carbon tetrachloride intoxication. When the above groups of mice with liver disease were compared with normal control mice in the same weight range, the LD 50 of ammonium chloride showed no striking change.

40|$|Objective: {{to define}} the role and place of {{hyperbaric}} oxygenation (HBO) in the treatment and prevention of liver cell failure. Material and methods. The results of the author&# 8217;s own studies and the data available {{in the literature on}} the impact of HBO on the functional state of the liver and the whole organism in liver cell failure were analyzed. Results: The therapeutic and preventive effects of HBO during therapy for liver cell failure were due to the ability of hyperbaric oxygen to regulate metabolic processes in the sick organism. By eliminating the impaired hepatic neutralization of ammonia, hyperbaric oxygen corrects its extrahepatic reactions in rendering harmless various toxic substances, which become active in response to the ammonia-neutralizing dysfunction of hepatocytes. This prevents the development of endogenous <b>ammonia</b> <b>intoxication.</b> In liver cell failure, HBO concurrently stimulates hepatic protein synthesis function and the cell link of the body&# 8217;s antimicrobial protection. The therapeutic effect of HBO is not always attended by the elimination of hepatic hypoxia and the sick organism&# 8217;s hypoxemia, but it persists long in the posthyperoxic period.

40|$|The {{effects of}} ammonia in {{pathophysiological}} concentrations were studied on the electrophysiology of putative glutamatergic synapses in the rat hippocampal formation; experiments {{were done in}} vitro and in vivo. Exposure of hippocampal slices to 5 mM ammonium chloride reduced the orthodromic population spike evoked in CA 1 and CA 3 pyramidal cell layer and in granule cell layer, following stimulation of their respective main afferent system. However, antidromic responses evoked in these groups of neurons were not affected by ammonia. In vitro, measures of the spike integral gave a better estimate {{of the extent of}} neuronal firing than did measures of the amplitude of the spikes. In vivo, perfusing the ventricular space with higher concentrations of ammonium salts (10 to 30 mM) produced similar effects to those shown in vitro on synaptic and non-synaptic responses in CA 1 and CA 3 regions. The sensitivity of pyramidal neurons to iontophoretic application of glutamate, aspartate and gamma-aminobutyric acid was not changed by ammonia. Experiments that used a paired pulse test showed an early effect of ammonia to cause disinhibition; this was attributed to a depression of the excitatory synapses on the inhibitory interneurons. It is concluded that hyperammonemia interferes with the release of glutamate, probably because ammonia inhibits glutaminase activity. The results suggest a deficiency of excitatory transmission as a possible mechanism {{in the development of the}} encephalopathy due to <b>ammonia</b> <b>intoxication</b> and the encephalopathies associated with hyperammonemia, e. g. hepatic encephalopathy...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the etiology of hyperammonemia associated with hyperlysinemia and massive homocitrullinuria. An 18 -year-old mentally and physically retarded male with periodic hyperammonemia is described. Levels of lysine and citrulline in his serum and those of blood ammonia were elevated and daily excretions of homocitrulline in his urine were strikingly high on an ordinary diet. With a decrease in protein intake to 1. 5 g/kg of body weight/day, only urinary homocitrulline excretion remained about ten times higher than the normal values while the other amino acids in his serum and urine appeared to be within the normal range. After an oral load of lysine on a normal protein intake, several abnormal findings were observed. That is, clinically he had episodes of irritability, vomiting, and coma caused by <b>ammonia</b> <b>intoxication.</b> Biochemically, levels of citrulline and arginine in his serum and the urinary homocitrulline excretion rate went on increasing and arginase in the blood cells was markedly depressed. Blood cell arginase, which showed lower activity than controls peculiary on a normal protein intake, was extremely inhibited by lysine in the vitro experiment. The blood cells contained much higher concentrations of lysine and homocitrulline than those of control subjects. Citrulline tolerance curve after the load of L-citrulline was found to be normal. Lysine : NAD-oxido-reductase activity in the liver was near the lower limits of the control values. The activity of argininosuccinate synthetase was reduced to 22 % of the control values. Arginase activity was also reduced. The partial defect of argininosuccinate synthetase as well as reduced arginase in the liver of the patient may be due to disorder of lysine metabolism and may play an important role in the etiology of hyperammonemia...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} (p < 0. 001) {{difference was}} found in the rate of ammonia forma-tion and theamountformed in heparinized dogand human blood at 4 #{ 176 }C. The initial ammonia concentration and the increase in ammonia formation with time were correlated for human blood. This in vitro ammonia formation was not prevented by certain enzyme inhibitors, but it continued after cells and plasma were exhaustively dialyzed against water or saline, sug-gesting that it originates from enzyme action. BLOOD AMMONIA CONCENTRATION increases rap-idly during storage. While studying ammonia metabolism in man and dogs (1, 2), we noticed that the blood ammonia concentration of dogs did not increase as rapidly on storage as did that of human blood. Whemi large amounts of blood are used during blood transfusions the concentration of ammonia in such blood can be critical, especially in patients with cirrhosis undergoing portocaval shunts. The cause of increase in ammonia during storage is not explained. Tobe (3) showed that the concen-tration of ammonia in shed whole blood steadily and spontaneously increased, and that the maxi-mum amount of ammonia was formed after seven days. Both plasma and erythrocytes contributed to this formation. There are compounds present in both plasma and erythrocytes that increase anirnonia in stored blood (4), possibly adenine and adenylic acid derivatives. The addition of a small amount of zinc bromide partially prevented this ammonia in-crease. Itin (5) presented evidence that the ammonia level in blood increased on storage to as much as 790 Mg/i 00 ml. They also indicated that blood transfusions were accompanied by an in-crease in the concentration of ammonia in patient sera. Materials and Methods Heparinized blood submitted to the laboratory for ammonia determination was allowed to stand at 4 #{ 176 }Cbefore blood ammonia was determined after 1, 3, and 7 days.

40|$|Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) is an X-linked, liver-specific {{enzyme that}} catalyzes {{the second step}} of the urea cycle. In humans, {{inherited}} deficiency of OTC in hemizygous affected males usually results in severe <b>ammonia</b> <b>intoxication</b> and early death. To characterize mutations responsible for OTC deficiency, we used the PCR to amplify cDNAs prepared from patient livers which demonstrated no OTC enzyme activity and no OTC cross-reacting material on western blots. In three of seven cases, smaller than normal products were observed. Sequencing of these cDNAs revealed that two were missing exon 7 of the OTC gene and that the other was missing the first 12 bp of exon 5. Sequencing of genomic DNA from these three patients revealed that one mutant missing exon 7 had a T-to-C substitution in the 5 ' splice donor site of intron 7. The other mutant missing exon 7 had an A-to-G change in the third position of intron 7. It is interesting that both of these mutations resulted in skipping the preceding exon rather than in inclusion of {{some or all of}} the affected intron. In the third mutant, an A-to-T substitution was found in the 3 ' splice acceptor site at the end of intron 4. Here, a cryptic splice acceptor site within exon 5 was used. Northern blotting of liver RNA from these patients demonstrated (a) reduced, but significant, amounts of OTC mRNA in one of the patients who had a deleted exon 7 but (b) very little OTC mRNA in the other two patients. We propose that these point mutations, which result in aberrant splicing of the OTC pre-mRNAs, lead to OTC deficiency through either decreased efficiency of mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytosol or synthesis of enzyme subunits that are unstable and rapidly degraded. We speculate that abnormal mRNA splicing may represent a relatively common mechanism in the pathogenesis of this disease...|$|E

İnsan kan serumunda ya da idrarında bulunan bazı organik asitlerin konsantrasyonu ile bağlantılı olarak birçok hastalığın teşhisinin mümkün olduğu bilinmektedir. Orotik asit, de nova pirimidin sentezinin dördüncü ara ürünüdür. Bu sentez, glutamin, 2 mol ATP ve CO 2 den meydana gelen karbomil fosfat ile başlar. Merkez bileşik üridin 5 ’-monofosfat (UMP) ’ dır. Bu bileşik iki enzim ile katalizlenir; orotat fosforibozil transferaz (OPRT) ve oratat monofosfat dekarboksilaz (OPD). Orotik asit B 13 vitamini olarak bilinir. Birçok deneysel çalışma orotik asidin karsigonesis, böbreklerde yağ depolanması ile ilgili olduğunu gösterdiği için orotik asidin biyolojik etkisi üzerine odaklanılmıştır. Orotik asidin tekrarlanan dozlarının tümör formlarının gelişmesini tetiklediği kabul edilmiştir. Orotik asidin idrar ile atılması söz konusu olduğundan kan plazmasında tayin edilmesindense idrarda tayin edilmesi daha olasıdır. Orotik asidin aşırılığının orotik asudüri denilen rahatsızlığa sebep olduğu bilinmektedir. Yetişkinlerde üre döngüsünde aksamaya sebep olur. Çocuklarda ise DNA ve RNA sentezinde kısıtlamaya yol açarak fiziksel ve sinirsel hasara sebep olabilir. Bu önemli hastalıkların teşhisinde güvenilir ve hassas bir metod geliştirilmesi gereklidir. Bu çalışmada, iyon kromatografi/suppressorlü iletkenlik dedektörü cihazı kullanarak insan idrarındaki orotik asidin miktarının tayini için seçici, güvenilir ve hassas bir yöntem geliştiriImesine çalışılmıştır.

In {{the latest}} decade, a growing interest {{has been noted}} for the determination of organic acids in biological, clinical and food samples. Some of organic acids found in human serum or urine have known {{in relation to their}} concentrations in biological fluids, since they are intermediates formed at various stages of amino acid as indicators of a variety of disease. Orotic acid (1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydro- 2, 6 -dioxo- 4 -pyrimidinecarboxylic acid; uracil- 6 -carboxylic acid) is a minor component of the diet. It is found in whey and root vegetables, such as carrots and beets. In contrast to sheep’s and goat’s milk, cow’s milk contains a relatively large amount of orotic acid, while human milk lacks this compound. The biological effects of orotic acid have been focus on considerable attention, because recent experimental studies have demonstrated that it has effects of carcinogenesis, hepatic lipid storage and renal toxicity. Several studies have shown that repeated dosing of orotic acid promotes the formation of tumours initiated by various known carcinogenic substances. Because renal excretion of orotic acid is very efficient and urinary values integrate changes over time, orotic acid measurements are more relevant in urine than in plasma. Orotic acid is an intermediate product in pyrimidine biosynthesis. It is a heterocyclic compound and an acid; it is also known as pyrimidinecarboxylic acid It was originally introduced as a vitamin, called vitamin B 13, but essentiality has not been demonstrated. It is not actually a vitamin, but was originally classified as such after being added to the diets of laboratory animals in the 1960 s. The addition of it to their food encouraged heart health and showed other vitamin-like benefits. Orotic acid is a very important substance but difficult to analyze in biological samples. New insights into the importance of pyrimidine biosynthesis and metabolism in humans followed the recognition of the first genetic defect, hereditary orotic aciduria. Orotic acid is an intermediary metabolite in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. The acid is present in healthy adults urine only at trace concentrations in urine. However, at the deficiency of enzyme uridine monophosphate synthase, which participates in the synthesis of uridylic acid from orotic acid, the excretion of orotic acid into urine increases (orotic aciduria). It may be about 1000 times higher in urine of patients having orotic acid as a diagnostic metabolite. To diagnose inborn error of organisms, it is important to use a method enabling for determination of both increased and normal levels of OA. Organic acidemias, also known as organic acidurias, are a group of disorders characterized by increased excretion of organic acids in urine. A spectrum of disorders characterized by enzymatic defects in biochemical pathways leading to toxic accumulations of molecules normally metabolized and safely excreted from the body. Numerous types of organic acidemias exist, with methylmalonic aciduria, propionic acidemia and isovaleric acidemia among the most prevalent forms. They result primarily from deficiencies of specific enzymes in the breakdown pathways of amino acids or from enzyme deficiencies in beta oxidation of fatty acids or carbohydrate metabolism. Children with an organic acidemia are susceptible to metabolic decompensation during episodes of increased catabolism, such as intercurrent illness, trauma, surgery, or prolonged episodes of fasting. Defects of pyrimidine methobolism can be lead to a variety of symptoms. The determination of the urinary orotic acid is very important to diagnose some inborn errors of metabolic pathways such as pyrimidine synthesis and urea cycle. Pyrimidines and purines are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidines also function as intermediates in synthesis of energy sources and essential elements of cell surface structures Pyrimidines are heterocyclic, six-membered, nitrogencontaining carbon ring structures, with uracil, cytosineand thymine being the basal structures of ribose-containing nucleosides (uridine, cytidine and thymidine respectively), or deoxyribose-containing deoxynucleosides, and their corresponding ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides Pyrimidines serve essential functions in human metabolism as ribonucleotide bases in RNA (uracil and cytosine), and as deoxyribonucleotide bases in DNA (cytosine and thymine), and are linked by phosphodiester bridges to purine nucleotides in double-stranded DNA, in both the nucleus and the mitochondria. Pyrimidines, similarly to purines, are synthesized de novo from simple precursors. Synthesis occurs in six steps, with cellular compartmentalization of specific steps in the cytosol or mitochondria, enabling changes in metabolic rate with need. Pyrimidine synthesis differs from purine synthesis, in that the single pyrimidine ring is assembled first and is then linked to ribose phosphate to form UMP. This gene encodes a uridine 5 -monophosphate synthase. The encoded protein is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the final two steps of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. The first reaction is carried out by the N-terminal enzyme orotate phosphoribosyltransferase which converts orotic acid to orotidine- 5 -monophosphate. The terminal reaction is carried out by the C-terminal enzyme OMP decarboxylase which converts orotidine- 5 -monophosphate to uridine monophosphate. Defects in this gene are the cause of hereditary orotic aciduria. The enzymes that catalyse UMP synthesis, CAD [carbamoylphosphate synthetase II (CPSII), aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) and dihydroorotase (DHOase) ], dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) and uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS), are encoded by only three genes – CAD, DHODH and UMPS are encoded by only three genes. An excess of orotic acid leads to a condition known as orotic aciduria. This condition can be hereditary or brought on by excessive consumption. In adults, it causes an interruption of the urea cycle. In children, it can cause inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis leading to mental or physical damage. Increased urinary orotic acid has been observed in patients and heterozygotes with hereditary metabolic disease. Severe trauma, pregnancy and a number of drugs have also increased the excretion of urinary orotic acid. The biological effects of orotic acid have been the focus of considerable attention, because recent experimental studies have demonstrated that it has effects of carcinogenesis, hepatic lipidstorage and renal toxicity. Orotic aciduria results from deficiency of either or both of the last two enzymes: oratate phosphoribosyl transferase and OMP decarboxylase as mentiones before, both these enzyme activities are present on a single protein as domains. Mutation in the phosphoribosyl transferase impairs its association with the other domain, resulting in loss of activity of both. This produces type I situation (orotic aciduria type I). This deficiency is treated by taking supplements of the compound uridine. In the type II, mutation in the decarboxylase occurs, but it does not effect its aggregation with phosphoribosyl transferase. In this case, only decarboxylase is inactive, whereas activity of phosphoribosyl transferase is not affected. This deficiency has been successfully treated with chronic uridine therapy. Orotic aciduria is a rare disease that is characterized by megaloblastic anemia. A devastating response to what is usually mild infection may be seen in any of the megaloblastic anemias of early life. The feature which led to the original recognition of the condition was crystalluria. Crystals of orotic acid have caused urethral and ureteral obstructions hematuria and azotemia. Disorder related to pyrimidine synthesis is hereditary orotic aciduria caused by deficiency of uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS), a bifunctional protein having two catalytic activities: orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) and orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase (ODC). A defect in both the activities is classified as orotic aciduri type I while ODC defect is denoted orotic aciduria type II. In most cases, orotic aciduria arises from inherited defects of enzymes involved in the urea cycle after synthesis of intramitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate. Excessice production of OA may also occur in defiency of ornithine transcarbomolayse, a urea cycle enzyme. It leads to accumulation of carbomyl phosphate, which is diverted for enhanced synthesis of OA. Increased urinary excretion of this compound follows, hence this defect is considered as a secondary orotic aciduria. Orotic acid excretion is also elevated by <b>ammonia</b> <b>intoxication,</b> during feeding of diets high in protein and in patients treated with diets high in protein and in patients treated with allopurinol or 6 -azauridine. Suitable chromatographic conditions and pre-treatment method was developed for reliable analysis of orotic acid in urine in this study. Samples were analyzed by ion chromatography / conductivity detector equipped with a Dionex Ion Pac® AS 20 analytical coluomn (2 x 250 mm) and a Dionex Ion Pac® AG 20 guard column (2 x 50 mm) using gradient and isocritic NaOH elution. Interferences from matrix in urine were removed by strongly cation exchange resin and solid-phase extraction after centrifugation and dilution. The calibration curves showed good linearity in the ranges of 10 - 10000 µg/L with the r 2 values of 0. 999. Significant results were obtained for various spiked urine samples with % recovery in the range of 85 - 95 %. The method was applied to urine samples collected from both healthy volunteers and patients with orotic aciduria. The value of urinary OA excretion, expressed in µmol/mmol of creatinine are reported in both healty volunteers and patient with orotic aciduria. The advantages of the method described herein are: (i) it allows determining trace amount of orotic acid from human urine samples, (ii) the sample preparation is overly simple, inexpensive, and (iii) the test is not time demanding and could be employed in routine analysis.
