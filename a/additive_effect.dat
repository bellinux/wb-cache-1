Therefore, patients receiving an opioid analgesic, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, or other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with Nalbuphine may exhibit an <b>additive</b> <b>effect.</b> When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol has an <b>additive</b> <b>effect</b> when {{combined}} with zopiclone, enhancing the adverse effects including the overdose potential of zopiclone significantly. Erythromycin appears to increase the absorption rate of zopiclone and prolong its elimination half-life, leading to increased plasma levels and more pronounced effects. Itraconazole has a similar effect on zopiclone pharmacokinetics as erythromycin. The elderly may be particularly sensitive to the erythromycin and itraconazole drug interaction with zopiclone. Temporary dosage reduction during combined therapy may be required, especially in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|Kapton tape {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used tapes and methods for TC and TC {{conductor}} attachment. When several layers are applied, each layer has an <b>additive</b> <b>effect</b> on the insulation and may negatively impact a profile. A disadvantage of this tape is that the PCB has to be very clean and smooth to achieve an airtight cover over the thermocouple weld and conductors. Another disadvantage to Kapton tape is that at temperatures above 200°C the tape becomes elastic and, hence, the TCs have a tendency to lift off the substrate surface. The result is erroneous readings characterized by jagged lines in the profile.|$|E
25|$|Though all of {{the above}} {{mentioned}} XSEs act to reduce xol-1 expression, experimentally reducing expression levels of these individual XSEs has been shown to have a minimal effect on sex determination and successful dosage compensation. This could be in part because these genes encode different proteins that act cooperatively rather than in an isolated fashion; for example, SEX-1 is a nuclear hormone receptor, while FOX-1 is an RNA-binding protein with properties capable of inducing post-transcriptional modifications in the xol-1 target. However, reducing the level of more than one XSE in different combinational permutations seems to have an <b>additive</b> <b>effect</b> on ensuring proper sex determination and resultant dosage compensation mechanics. This supports the hypothesis that these XSEs act together to achieve the desired sex determination and dosage compensation fate. Thus, in this model organism, the achieved level of X-chromosome expression is directly correlated to the activation of multiple XSEs that ultimately function to repress xol-1 expression in a developing worm embryo. A summary of this C. elegans mechanism of dosage compensation is illustrated below.|$|E

500|$|Water has {{different}} acoustic properties {{from those of}} air. Sound from an underwater source can propagate relatively freely through body tissues where there is contact with the water as the acoustic properties are similar. When the head is exposed to the water, some sound is transmitted by the eardrum and middle ear, but a significant part reaches the cochlea independently, by bone conduction. Some sound localisation is possible, though difficult. [...] Human hearing underwater, {{in cases where the}} diver’s ear is wet, is less sensitive than in air. Frequency sensitivity underwater also differs from that in air, with a consistently higher threshold of hearing underwater; sensitivity to higher frequency sounds is reduced the most. [...] The type of headgear affects noise sensitivity and noise hazard depending on whether transmission is wet or dry. Human hearing underwater is less sensitive with wet ears than in air, and a neoprene hood causes substantial attenuation. When wearing a helmet, hearing sensitivity is similar to that in surface air, as it is not greatly affected by the breathing gas or chamber atmosphere composition or pressure. Because sound travels faster in heliox than in air, voice formants are raised, making divers' speech high-pitched and distorted, and hard to understand for people not used to it. The increased density of breathing gases under pressure has a similar and <b>additive</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

In contrast to most studies, this study examines disinfection of municipal water in a pilot-scale system using a mixed bacterial suspension, which enables a better simulation of the conditions encountered in actual industrial environments.

40|$|Dominance {{may be an}} {{important}} source of non-additive genetic variance for many traits of dairy cattle. However, nearly all prediction models for dairy cattle have included only <b>additive</b> <b>effects</b> because of the limited number of cows with both genotypes and phenotypes. The role of dominance in the Holstein and Jersey breeds was investigated for eight traits: milk, fat, and protein yields; productive life; daughter pregnancy rate; somatic cell score; fat percent and protein percent. Additive and dominance variance components were estimated and then used to estimate <b>additive</b> and dominance <b>effects</b> of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The predictive abilities of three models with both <b>additive</b> and dominance <b>effects</b> and a model with <b>additive</b> <b>effects</b> only were assessed using ten-fold cross-validation. One procedure estimated dominance values, and another estimated dominance deviations; calculation of the dominance relationship matrix was different for the two methods. The third approach enlarged the dataset by including cows with genotype probabilities derived using genotyped ancestors. For yield traits, dominance variance accounted for 5 and 7 % of total variance for Holsteins and Jerseys, respectively; using dominance deviations resulted in smaller dominance and larger additive variance estimates. For non-yield traits, dominance variances were very small for both breeds. For yield traits, including <b>additive</b> and dominance <b>effects</b> fit the data better than including only additive effects; average correlations between estimated genetic effects and phenotypes showed that prediction accuracy increased when both effects rather than just <b>additive</b> <b>effects</b> were included. No corresponding gains in prediction ability were found for non-yield traits. Including cows with derived genotype probabilities from genotyped ancestors did not improve prediction accuracy. The largest <b>additive</b> <b>effects</b> were located on chromosome 14 near DGAT 1 for yield traits for both breeds; those SNPs also showed the largest dominance effects for fat yield (both breeds) as well as for Holstein milk yield...|$|R
