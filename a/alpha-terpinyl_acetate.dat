50|$|Bay leaves {{have been}} used in {{entomology}} as the active ingredient in killing jars. The crushed, fresh, young leaves are put into the jar under a layer of paper. The vapors they release kill insects slowly but effectively, and keep the specimens relaxed and easy to mount. The leaves discourage the growth of molds. They are not effective for killing large beetles and similar specimens, but insects that have been killed in a cyanide killing jar can be transferred to a laurel jar to await mounting. There is confusion in the literature about whether Laurus nobilis is a source of cyanide to any practical extent, but {{there is no evidence that}} cyanide is relevant to its value in killing jars. It certainly is rich in various essential oil components that could incapacitate insects in high concentrations; such compounds include 1,8-cineole, <b>alpha-terpinyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> and methyl eugenol. It also is unclear to what extent the alleged effect of cyanide released by the crushed leaves has been mis-attributed to Laurus nobilis in confusion with the unrelated Prunus laurocerasus, the so-called cherry laurel, which certainly does contain dangerous concentrations of cyanogenic glycocides together with the enzymes to generate the hydrogen cyanide from the glycocides if the leaf is physically damaged.|$|E
40|$|Leaves of Bay (Laurus nobilis L.) were {{collected}} in different phonological stages and air-dried. Volatile oil of the leaves were obtained using hydro- and steam distillation and the chemical composition were analyzed by GC and GC/Mass and identified in comparison with authentic compounds. The yield of essential oil were 0. 8 to 1. 5 v/w% and the major compounds were; 1, 8 Cineol, <b>alpha-terpinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and Sabinene. Because of the interesting yield of the oil and presence of 1, 8 -Cineol as the major compounds, the bearing ripe fruit stage in the mid of September {{is the best time}} for harvesting the Bay leaves in Iran...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} essential oils of Salvia desoleana Atzei & Picci and Salvia sclarea L. from Sardinia (Italy) was analysed by GC and CC/MS. S. desoleana oil had a high content of monoterpenic esters (linalyl acetate and <b>alpha-terpinyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> and a lower amount of the corresponding alcohols while S. sclarea oil was characterised by a higher content of alcohols and lower quantity of esters. We studied the antimicrobial activity of these oils concerning their use in pharmaceutical preparations for local application. Only weak microbiostatic inhibitory activity was seen against S. aureus, E. coli, S. epidermidis and C. albicans, but since inhibition increased progressively with contact time, better results could be obtained by using these oils in bioadhesive formulations that would also have anti-inflammatory and peripheral analgesic action at a local level, as demonstrated in experimental animals following systemic application...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBay leaves (Laurus nobilis L.) {{are widely}} used as a {{condiment}} and their therapeutic benefits are well known. These biological properties were attributed to a plethora of highly bioactive secondary metabolites namely essential oils and phenolics. However, their recovery from plant matrix is generally limited {{by the presence of}} physical barrier (cell wall). Thus, the use of novel extraction procedures to enhance their release is particularly important. Therefore, the aim of this work is to assess the potential use of enzyme treatment (cellulase, hemicellulase, xylanase end the ternary mixture of them) as a tool to improve the extraction efficiency of bioactive compounds from bay leaves. Results showed that enzyme pre-treatment resulted in 243, 227, 240. 54 and 0. 48 % increase in the essential oil yields in samples treated with cellulase, hemicellulase, xylanase and the ternary mixture, respectively. Compositional analysis by GC and GC MS revealed remarkable enrichment of the essential oils derived from enzyme-treated samples with oxygenated monoterpenes, leading hence to better antioxidant activity as revealed by the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and azino-bis-(3 -ethylbenzothiolzoline 6 -sulphonic acid) (ABTS) assays. The 1, 8 -cineole, <b>alpha-terpinyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> methyl eugenol, linalool, a-pinene, sabinene and beta-pinene were found as the most prominent components in all essential oils. Most importantly, enzyme treatment did not induce transformation of the volatile components, but it contributes to the liberation of some glycosidically bound volatiles. Moreover, it significantly enhances the release of phenolic compounds from the hydro distilled residual leaves and consequently their antioxidant activity. These results suggest that enzyme pre-treatment could be useful for extracting valuables components, and hold good potential for use in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries...|$|E
