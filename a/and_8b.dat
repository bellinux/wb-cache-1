Keck Observatory confirmed the planetary {{nature of the}} transit event and established a mass estimate for the planet.

5|$|Route 18 {{begins at}} a partial-cloverleaf {{interchange}} with New Jersey Route 138 in Wall. At {{the southern end}} of the interchange, the right-of-way and unused pavement for the southern extension is visible along with the former on-ramp from Route 138 to Route 18 northbound. The highway heads northward as a four-lane freeway, crossing under Route 138. Route 18 interchanges with Route 138 westbound and Monmouth Boulevard, a local road in New Bedford. Route 18 then crosses under Monmouth Boulevard and County Route 18 (Belmar Boulevard) in the community of Glendola. The route continues through Glendola, and interchanges with Brighton Avenue (southbound Interchanges 7A and 7B). The freeway continues south of the Shark River Golf Course, through Neptune, paralleling Brighton Avenue, and interchanges with Route 33 and County Route 17 at exit 8. Although signed as exit 8 northbound, the interchange is divided into exits 8A <b>and</b> <b>8B</b> heading southbound. The roadway crosses into Ocean Township and crosses under County Route 17 (West Bangs Avenue). In Ocean Township, there are exits for Route 66 and Asbury Avenue, Deal Road, and West Park Avenue. Farther north, the highway enters Eatontown.|$|E
25|$|The {{power plant}} is {{connected}} to the 330kV and 750kV electrical grid. The block has two electrical generators connected to the 750kV grid by a single generator transformer. The generators are connected to their common transformer by two switches in series. Between them, the unit transformers are connected to supply power to the power plant's own systems; each generator can therefore be connected to the unit transformer to power the plant, or to the unit transformer and the generator transformer to also feed power to the grid. The 330kV line is normally not used, and serves as an external power supply, connected by a station transformer to the power plant's electrical systems. The plant can be powered by its own generators, or get power from the 750kV grid through the generator transformer, or from the 330kV grid via the station transformer, or from the other power plant block via two reserve busbars. In case of total external power loss, the essential systems can be powered by diesel generators. Each unit transformer {{is connected to}} two 6kV main power boards, A and B (e.g. 7A, 7B, 8A, 8B for generators 7 and 8), powering principal non-essential drivers and connected to transformers for the 4kV main power and the 4kV reserve busbar. The 7A, 7B, <b>and</b> <b>8B</b> boards are also connected to the three essential power lines (namely for the coolant pumps), each also having its own diesel generator. In case of a coolant circuit failure with simultaneous loss of external power, the essential power can be supplied by the spinning down turbogenerators for about 45–50 seconds, during which time the diesel generators should start up. The generators are started automatically within 15 seconds at loss of off-site power.|$|E

500|$|The highway {{enters the}} city of Baltimore and curves to the east over Patapsco Avenue before Exit 7 with MD 2 (Potee Street), which {{includes}} a loop ramp to southbound MD 2 and a ramp from the intersection of MD 2 and MD 173 (Patapsco Avenue). I-895 parallels CSX's Curtis Bay Branch as the highway passes along {{the northern edge of}} the Brooklyn neighborhood. The highway crosses the Curtis Bay Branch on a steel K truss bridge ahead of Exits 8A <b>and</b> <b>8B.</b> Exit 8A includes a loop ramp to and a flyover ramp from Shell Road, which heads toward the Curtis Bay, Baltimore neighborhood. Exit 8B includes ramps from eastbound Frankfurst Avenue and to westbound Frankfurst Avenue; that street leads to Hanover Street and downtown Baltimore. I-895 passes through the 14-booth toll plaza for the tunnel; immediately to the east of the toll plaza is Exit 9, a half-diamond interchange with Childs Street for traffic to and from the toll plaza.

50|$|There {{are various}} types of {{difficulty}} settings in this game, and specifics vary from game to game. Usually {{there are at least}} Arcade, Mission and Freestyle options available. During Arcade and Freestyle, the player has the option of choosing which button layout to follow. Button layouts scale from just two buttons up to a maximum of eight buttons. Which button layouts are available for the player depends on the type of game. For example, original DJMAX Portable features button layouts 4B, 6B <b>and</b> <b>8B,</b> while DJMAX Portable 2 features button layouts 4B, 5B, 6B <b>and</b> <b>8B.</b> Button layouts offer first selection of difficulty for player. 4B being the easy mode <b>and</b> <b>8B</b> being hard mode. Every song in the DJMAX Portable series and Trilogy has a rating which indicates the difficulty of the song. Some songs are available in more difficult formats. For example, the player can try to play an 8B song fitted for a 6B layout. These are marked usually with HD (Hard), MX (Maximum) or SC (Super Crazy) as opposed to NM (Normal) of the 6B layout default difficulty. It significantly increases difficulty from the 6B NM mode when player plays 6B MX instead. It allows player to have higher score in 6B layout mode.|$|E
