2500|$|She {{wrote it}} with American {{songwriter}} and producer Dan Wilson. It {{was one of}} the last written for 21. The track, which epitomizes the lyrical content of 21, summarizes the now defunct relationship that the record is all about. Adele has openly discussed the genesis of it saying, [...] "Well, I wrote that song because I was exhausted from being such a bitch, with 'Rolling in the Deep' or 'Rumour Has It' ... I was really emotionally drained from the way I was portraying him, because even though I'm very bitter and regret some parts of it, he's still the most important person that's ever been in my life, and 'Someone like You,' I had to write it to feel OK with myself and OK with the two years I spent with him. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it, I felt so freed." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Scotland {{had lost}} both Tests against the All Blacks {{earlier in the}} season but the second, in Auckland, had been close: the Blacks just sneaked home by 21-18. Perhaps that persuaded people that, in the light of our Test series win over the French, we were favourites. Whoever made public that {{sentiment}} did us scant favour. We were lulled into {{a false sense of security}} and yet, on the day, we were also intimidated because we didn't play our natural game, preferring instead to sit back and wait for them to come at us. Also, we didn't kick well that day, particularly Michael Lynagh. I hardly saw the ball, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> I was clobbered. Not feeling the ball in my hands destroys me anyway; I cannot take it. That day we were more afraid of making a mistake, worrying about who we were playing against, rather than getting on with our own game. And when we did run it we were totally predictable. The Blacks knew the ball would head out to me when it was shifted, and so whenever I got it they hammed me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 and 2012, Plunkett {{struggled}} with form and played just three Championship matches for Durham. In October 2012, Plunkett signed {{to play for}} Yorkshire. He stated, [...] "At this stage of my career, I believe that a fresh challenge would benefit me and I feel this is required to help me reach my goal of representing my country again". In his first season at Yorkshire, Plunkett played in 12 of the club's 16 matches in the County Championship, managing to take 36 wickets. He credits Jason Gillespie, Yorkshire's coach and former Australia international fast bowler, with helping him regain his confidence and felt that his problems had been exacerbated by over-coaching. In an interview in June 2014 Plunkett explained [...] "Different coaches told me different things and when you're a youngster you're like a sponge and {{take a lot of}} things in.... When I came to Yorkshire, Jason Gillespie just told me to run it and bowl quick. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that I backed myself, bowled in my good areas and started picking up wickets." [...] Under the tutelage of Yorkshire coach and former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie, Plunkett's fortunes improved and he was awarded his county cap in 2013. The following year, Plunkett was recalled to the England Test team.|$|E

2500|$|As the taped {{conversation}} continued, {{the jury}} heard Saldívar's {{reaction to the}} news of Selena's death after her phone picked up a local radio station's signal. In an angry voice, Saldívar asked Young why he had kept the singer's condition from her, since she wanted to visit Selena at the hospital, believing she was still alive. Young told Saldívar not to believe the radio announcement, {{and that he did}} not know about Selena's current condition. The conversation then switched to Saldívar blaming Quintanilla, Jr. for the murder claiming that he threatened to kill her. She explained to Young that she bought the gun for protection after finding her car tires deliberately slashed. She also told him how Quintanilla, Jr. sexually abused her by [...] "sticking a knife" [...] in her vagina, threatening to murder her if she went to the police. When asked about what happened in her motel room, Saldívar exclaimed: [...] "I bought this gun to kill myself, not her, and she told me, 'Yolanda, I don't want you to kill yourself.' And we were talking about that when I took it out and pointed it to my head, and when I pointed it to my head, she opened the door. I said 'Selena, close that door,' <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that gun went off." ...|$|E
