5|$|In 1974 the {{commission}} was reopened and issued a supplementary report, which remained classified for 25 years until published by the magazine India Today. The report said that 26,000 people were killed, rapes numbered in the hundreds, and that the Mukti Bahini rebels engaged in widespread rape and other human rights abuses. Sumit Ganguly, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>scientist,</b> believes that the Pakistani establishment has yet {{to come to terms}} with the atrocities carried out, saying that, in a visit to Bangladesh in 2002, Pervez Musharraf expressed regret for the atrocities rather than accepting responsibility.|$|E

Liu Shanying, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>scientist</b> at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who used to work for CCTV, speculated that the showing indicated that Chinese film censorship might be being loosened.|$|E
5|$|Yoseph Yapi Taum, a {{lecturer}} at Sanata Dharma University in Yogyakarta, views Tini's aloof {{nature as a}} major force driving Tono to Yah; her lifestyle, of which Tono is not a part, alienates him and drives him to find a more traditional woman. Tham Seong Chee, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>scientist</b> from Singapore, views her as a weak-willed character, unwilling to act before meeting Hartono again and even then unable to solve her marital difficulties with Tono. He also sees her as being fettered by her own values, which are incompatible with those held by the general Indonesian populace. The Indonesian writer and literary critic Goenawan Mohamad views her as driven {{in part by the}} stress placed on her by her husband's expectations.|$|E

25|$|In 1946, {{economist}} George Bach {{was hired}} by the Carnegie Institute of Technology (predecessor of Carnegie Mellon University) to restart the school’s economics department.

Cooper from the field of Operations Research (which had increased its visibility during the war) and Herbert A. Simon, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>scientist</b> who was to direct the undergraduate business program. The beginnings of the Cold War were applying pressure on the academic community to increase US managerial ability, and when William Larimer Mellon gave a $6 million grant to found a school of industrial administration, Bach became the first dean, bringing along the entire economics department.|$|E
25|$|Interactions between {{ethnic groups}} in formal {{settings}} can also help countries torn apart by ethnic violence to recover and break down ethnic divisions. Paula Pickering, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>scientist,</b> who studies peace-building efforts in Bosnia, finds that formal workplaces are often the site where inter-ethnic ties are formed. She claims that mixed workplaces lead to repeated inter-ethnic interaction where norms of professionalism compel everyone to cooperate and to treat each other with respect, {{making it easier for}} individuals belonging to the minority group to reach out and form relationships with everyone else. Nevertheless, Giuliano's research in Russia has shown that economic grievances, even in a mixed workplace, can be politicized on ethnic lines.|$|E

25|$|Willard E. Hotchkiss became Armour Institute's third {{president}} {{at a time}} when the school was still feeling the effects of the Depression. <b>A</b> <b>political</b> <b>scientist</b> and economist, he had been serving as dean of the graduate school of business at Stanford University. With considerable experience in dealing with business economic problems, he was considered the right choice at an important time in Armour Institute's history. Under his leadership, a department of social sciences, fifth-year courses in architecture and in chemical and civil engineering were established. While graduate-level courses had long been offered, few advanced degrees had been awarded. Hotchkiss led the expansion of study programs leading to Master of Science degrees. In his last year as president, the Research Foundation of Armour Institute of Technology was established to develop technological innovation for industry. Two years later, the famous Snow Cruiser vehicle was engineered for use in Admiral Richard Byrd's South Pole expedition.|$|E

25|$|As in the 2005 {{election}}s, the Red-Green Coalition won {{the election}} with less votes (this time 47.9%) than the opposition parties (49.5%). Peter N. Myhre of the Progress Party complained that this meant eight years with a government that had not truly won an election, and called for an overhaul of an electoral system that, he claimed, disproportionately favours the Norwegian periphery. Hanne Marthe Narud, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>scientist</b> at the University of Oslo, identified the result {{as a consequence of}} deliberate political planning, and in particular of a 2001 compromise in the Storting that balanced proportionality against an intent to over-represent rural areas. She explained to Dagbladet that this trend could be dated as far back as 1917, when it was argued that Oslo's status as the national capital inherently gave it greater influence, so that it should have less representation in parliament compared with rural areas. Electoral researcher Bernt Aardal stated that he had calculated the results of the election without the rural skewness. His results showed that the Labour Party and Progress Party would both lose a representative, while Red and the Liberal Party would each gain one, still giving a majority to the Red-Green Coalition.|$|E
500|$|According to Peter Tomsen, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>scientist,</b> Pakistan's {{secret service}} the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, in {{conjunction}} with the political party Jamaat-e-Islami, formed militias such as Al-Badr ("the moon") and the Al-Shams ("the sun") to conduct operations against the nationalist movement. These militias targeted non-combatants and committed rapes as well as other crimes. Local collaborators known as Razakars also took part in the atrocities. The term has since become a pejorative akin to the western term [...] "Judas".|$|E
500|$|Robert Ford, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>scientist</b> at the University of Manchester, {{reported}} on a YouGov survey on partisan reactions to the Downing Street cats. Participants in the survey were shown a picture of Humphrey, the Chief Mouser appointed by Margaret Thatcher, and told that he was either Thatcher's cat or Tony Blair's cat. Affinity for the cat divided along partisan lines: Conservative voters liked the cat far more when they were told he was Thatcher's and Labour voters liked the cat far more when they were told he was Blair's. Ford concludes that partisanship shapes reactions to everything a politician does, however trivial, similar to the halo effect (and a reverse [...] "forked tail effect") observed by psychologists.|$|E
