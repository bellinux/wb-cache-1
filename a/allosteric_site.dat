5|$|A mixed {{inhibitor}} binds to an <b>allosteric</b> <b>site</b> and {{the binding}} of the substrate and the inhibitor affect each other. The enzyme's function is reduced but not eliminated when {{bound to the}} inhibitor. This type of inhibitor does not follow the Michaelis-Menten equation.|$|E
5|$|In mixed inhibition, the {{inhibitor}} {{can bind to}} {{the enzyme}} {{at the same time}} as the enzyme's substrate. However, the binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate, and vice versa. This type of inhibition can be reduced, but not overcome by increasing concentrations of substrate. Although it is possible for mixed-type inhibitors to bind in the active site, this type of inhibition generally results from an allosteric effect where the inhibitor binds to a different site on an enzyme. Inhibitor binding to this <b>allosteric</b> <b>site</b> changes the conformation (i.e., tertiary structure or three-dimensional shape) of the enzyme so that the affinity of the substrate for the active site is reduced.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are also}} {{important}} in metabolic control. Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition. A good example is the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic pathway. This catabolic pathway consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate. A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an <b>allosteric</b> <b>site</b> in PFK1 to decrease {{the rate of the}} enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} to note that while all non-competitive inhibitors bind the enzyme at <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites</b> (i.e. locations other than its active site)—not all inhibitors that bind at <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites</b> are non-competitive inhibitors. [...] In fact, allosteric inhibitors may act as competitive, non-competitive, or uncompetitive inhibitors.|$|R
40|$|AbstractStaurosporine {{and four}} {{staurosporine}} derivatives were docked on the rhodopsin-based homology {{model of the}} M 1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in order to localize the possible <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites</b> of this receptor. It was {{found that there were}} three major <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites,</b> two of which are located at the extracellular face of the receptor, and one in the intracellular domain of the receptor. In the present study, the localization of these binding sites is described for the first time. The present study confirms the existence of multiple <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites</b> on the M 1 muscarinic receptor, and lays the ground for further experimental and computational analysis to better understand how muscarinic receptors are modulated via their <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites.</b> These findings will also help to design and develop novel drugs acting as allosteric modulators of the M 1 receptor, which can be used in the treatment of the Alzheimer’s disease...|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} explain this phenomenon, {{researchers}} from Lundbeck proposed that escitalopram enhances its own binding via an additional interaction with another <b>allosteric</b> <b>site</b> on the transporter.|$|E
25|$|Ketamine {{acts as a}} {{selective}} antagonist of the NMDA receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor. It binds specifically to the dizocilpine (MK-801) site of the NMDA receptor, near the channel pore, and is an uncompetitive antagonist. Ketamine may also interact with and inhibit the NMDAR via another <b>allosteric</b> <b>site</b> on the receptor. Its full mechanism of action is not well-understood as of 2017.|$|E
25|$|Further {{research}} by the same group showed that (R)-citalopram also enhances binding of escitalopram, and therefore the allosteric interaction cannot explain the observed counteracting effect. In the most recent paper, however, the same authors again reversed their findings and reported that (R)-citalopram decreases binding of escitalopram to the transporter. Although allosteric binding of escitalopram to the serotonin transporter is of unquestionable research interest, its clinical relevance is unclear since the binding of escitalopram to the <b>allosteric</b> <b>site</b> is at least 1000 times weaker than to the primary binding site.|$|E

40|$|Natural ligands of G-protein-coupled receptors {{interact}} with the orthosteric ligand binding site, as {{do most of the}} classical synthetic ligands. The discovery of ligands targeting different, <b>allosteric</b> binding <b>sites</b> considerably expanded the repertoire of G-protein-coupled receptor ligands.

25|$|Regulation of RNR is {{designed}} to maintain balanced quantities of dNTPs. Binding of effector molecules either increases or decreases RNR activity. When ATP binds to the allosteric activity site, it activates RNR. In contrast, when dATP binds to this site, it deactivates RNR. In addition to controlling activity, the allosteric mechanism also regulates the substrate specificity and ensures the enzyme produces {{an equal amount of}} each dNTP for DNA synthesis. In all classes, binding of ATP or dATP to the <b>allosteric</b> <b>site</b> induces reduction of cytidine 5’-diphosphate (CDP) and uridine 5’-diphosphate (UDP); 2’-deoxyguanosine 5’-triphosphate (dGTP) induces reduction of adenosine 5’-diphosphate (ADP); and 2’-deoxythymidine 5’-triphosphate (dTTP) induces reduction of guanosine 5’-diphosphate (GDP) (Figure 1).|$|E
500|$|The second form of [...] "non-competitive antagonists" [...] act at an <b>allosteric</b> <b>site.</b> These antagonists bind to a {{distinctly}} separate binding site from the agonist, exerting their action to that receptor via the other binding site. They [...] do {{not compete with}} agonists for binding at the active site. The bound antagonists may prevent conformational changes in the receptor required for receptor activation after the agonist binds. [...] Cyclothiazide {{has been shown to}} act as a reversible non-competitive antagonist of mGluR1 receptor.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of small chemical inhibitors of human Kinesin-5 through a pioneering in vitro phenotypic screening on cancer cell lines {{has led to}} both {{the development of new}} anticancer therapeutic agents, and to novel tools to probe the mechanism of microtubule motor proteins. [...] This toolkit of allosteric inhibitors has been used to probe the specific role of Kinesin-5 in mitotic spindle assembly [...] as well as fine dissection of motor domain function. [...] Through this work it was found that, in mammalian cells, Kinesin-5 is required for the initial assembly of the mitotic spindle during prophase and prometaphase, but is dispensable to traverse subsequent anaphase during a round of mitosis. [...] Also, the binding of the Kinesin-5 inhibitors to an <b>allosteric</b> <b>site</b> on the motor interrupts the mechanism by which this enzyme converts the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into the mechanical work of moving microtubules, thus providing insight on how this enzyme works.|$|E
40|$|Small {{molecule}} docking to protein targets {{was developed}} as a drug discovery tool {{at a time when}} drug discovery was focused predominantly on enzyme active <b>sites</b> rather than <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites.</b> However, as early as 1963, Monod and coworkers astutely pointed out that protein function can be regulated allosterically by small molecules that need not be structurally related to a protein’s target (e. g. substrate) because they bind somewhere other than the active <b>site</b> [1]. Some <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites</b> are similar to active sites, which are often located in deep grooves, somewhat buried in the protein structure, and contain a limited set of residues that provide a well defined binding <b>site.</b> Other <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites</b> are more like protein-protein interfaces (PPIs), which have less rigid binding requirements, frequently have species-specific variations in composition, and have overall greater structural flexibility. Application of computational docking to <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites</b> or PPIs has been done successfully [2 – 5] despite the fact that most related software has been developed and benchmarked with active sites in mind [6]. Oftentimes targeting PPIs is undertaken to find small molecules that will interfere with oligomer assembly. Alternatively, one can target a specific cleft formed at a PPI with the notion of stabilizing a particular assembly. We have undertaken a series o...|$|R
40|$|The site {{of action}} of four metals (copper, lead, nickel and zinc) on the aminolevulinic acid dehydratase of human {{erythrocytes}} was studied. Data obtained after denaturation of <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites</b> with heat treatment and after simultaneous incubation with two metals suggest the following conclusions: copper acts on the catalytic site, whereas lead, nickel and zinc act on the allosteric sites; zinc and nickel act on the same allosteric (metallic) site; zinc and lead only partially act on the same metallic site; nickel and lead act on different <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R
50|$|Phencyclidine {{and related}} {{drugs such as}} benocyclidine, tenocyclidine, ketamine, and {{dizocilpine}} (MK-801), {{have been shown to}} inhibit the reuptake of the monoamine neurotransmitters. They appear to exert their reuptake inhibition by binding to vaguely characterized <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites</b> on each of the respective monoamine transporters. Benztropine, mazindol, and vanoxerine also bind to these sites and have similar properties. In addition to their high affinity for the main site of the monoamine transporters, several competitive transporter substrates such as cocaine and indatraline have lower affinity for these <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites</b> as well.|$|R
500|$|A {{receptor}} antagonist {{is a type}} of [...] receptor ligand or {{drug that}} blocks or dampens a biological response by binding to and blocking a receptor rather than activating it like an agonist. They are sometimes called blockers; examples include alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. In pharmacology, antagonists have affinity but no efficacy for their cognate receptors, and binding will disrupt the interaction and inhibit the function of an agonist or inverse agonist at receptors. Antagonists mediate their effects by binding to the active site or to the <b>allosteric</b> <b>site</b> on a receptor, or they may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor's activity. Antagonist activity may be reversible or irreversible depending on the longevity of the antagonist–receptor complex, which, in turn, depends on the nature of antagonist–receptor binding. The majority of drug antagonists achieve their potency by competing with endogenous ligands or substrates at structurally defined binding sites on receptors.|$|E
500|$|Biochemical receptors {{are large}} protein {{molecules}} {{that can be}} activated by the binding of a ligand such as a hormone or a drug. Receptors can be membrane-bound, as cell surface receptors, or inside the cell as intracellular receptors, such as nuclear receptors {{including those of the}} mitochondrion. Binding occurs as a result of non-covalent interactions between the receptor and its ligand, at locations called the binding site on the receptor. [...] A receptor may contain one or more binding sites for different ligands. Binding to the active site on the receptor regulates receptor activation directly. The activity of receptors can also be regulated by the binding of a ligand to other sites on the receptor, as in allosteric binding sites. Antagonists mediate their effects through receptor interactions by preventing agonist-induced responses. This may be accomplished by binding to the active site or the <b>allosteric</b> <b>site.</b> In addition, antagonists may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor's activity to exert their effects.|$|E
500|$|A non-competitive {{antagonist}} {{is a type}} of insurmountable antagonist {{that may}} act in one of two ways: by binding to the active site of the receptor or by binding to an <b>allosteric</b> <b>site</b> of the receptor; in the latter case, the antagonist is called an allosteric antagonist. [...] While the mechanism of antagonism is different in both of these phenomena, they are both called [...] "non-competitive" [...] because the end-results of each are functionally very similar. Unlike competitive antagonists, which affect the amount of agonist necessary to achieve a maximal response but do not affect the magnitude of that maximal response, non-competitive antagonists reduce the magnitude of the maximum response that can be attained by any amount of agonist. This property earns them the name [...] "non-competitive" [...] because their effects cannot be negated, no matter how much agonist is present. [...] In functional assays of non-competitive antagonists, depression of the maximal response of agonist dose-response curves, and in some cases, rightward shifts, is produced. The rightward shift will occur {{as a result of a}} receptor reserve (also known as spare receptors) and inhibition of the agonist response will only occur when this reserve is depleted.|$|E

However, for most allosteric proteins identified to date the mechanistic details of allosteric modulation are not yet well understood. Uncovering common mechanistic patterns underlying allostery would allow not only a better academic understanding of the phenomena, but it would also streamline the design of novel therapeutic solutions.

In this article, we describe a simple computational approach, based on the effect allosteric ligands exert on protein flexibility upon binding, to predict the existence and position of <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites</b> on a given protein structure. Results: By querying the literature and a recently available database of <b>allosteric</b> <b>sites,</b> we gathered 213 allosteric proteins with structural information that we further filtered into a non-redundant set of 91 proteins.
