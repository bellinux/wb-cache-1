500|$|Not all reviews were negative, however. Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a more {{positive}} review, writing [...] "Perhaps I am alone in sensing the off-beat love story I found {{to be at the}} heart of 'Alpha'. But it reached out and grabbed me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> to be touching, interesting and worthy of analysis." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with NME magazine, frontman Alex Turner cited John Lennon {{as a major}} influence lyrically. When speaking about Lennon, Turner said; [...] "I remember when I first started writing songs, and writing lyrics, I {{really wanted to be}} able to write an [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] type song, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> very difficult. You listen to that and it sounds like it's all nonsense, but it's difficult to write that sort of thing and make it compelling. Lennon definitely had a knack for that".|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Terry-Thomas {{was offered}} the role of Lt-Colonel J. Algernon Hawthorne in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, and turned down the {{opportunity}} before leaving for the UK. By the time his flight arrived in London he had changed his mind, so he telephoned producer Stanley Kramer {{from the airport to}} signal his acceptance, and [...] "popped back on a plane to be fitted for the part" [...] the same day. He was not comfortable with many of the other actors on set, later commenting that [...] "I was the only non-American, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> exhausting and embarrassing because they never relaxed. They were always 'on'." [...] One of the American stars was Spencer Tracy, whom Terry-Thomas considered [...] "an extra-special man"; Tracy and Buster Keaton—who also appeared in the film—were described by Terry-Thomas as [...] "the only two people who ever produced in me this awe of greatness".|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Cyprus Avenue" [...] is a three chord blues {{composition}} and served {{for many years}} as the closing song for most of Morrison's live shows. [...] Along with [...] "Madame George", it {{is the centerpiece of}} the album and both songs are Belfast related and highly impressionistic. [...] The song is told {{from the point of view}} of an outsider watching from inside an automobile and getting tongue-tied as the refined school girl he fantasizes about appears and he imagines her a fine lady with [...] "rainbow ribbons in her hair" [...] in a carriage drawn by six white horses and [...] "returning from a fair". Van Morrison described Cyprus Avenue as [...] "a street in Belfast, [...] a place where there's a lot of wealth. [...] It wasn't far from where I was brought up and it was a very [...] different scene. [...] To me it was a very mystical place. [...] It was a whole avenue lined with trees <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> a place where I could think." ...|$|E
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by television critics. Ology writer Josh Harrison gave the episode a {{nine out of}} ten rating, and opined that the episode was a [...] "home run episode" [...] for the series. Harrison continued: [...] "Its central conflict is intense, its action is solid, and its new arrivals are engaging characters in their own right. Light on the gore and heavy on the drama—just how I like my Sunday night zombie adventures." [...] Scott Meslow from The Atlantic gave the episode a positive review, deeming it as an improvement from the previous episode, and appreciated that the episode had opened up new plot points for future episodes to come. Meslow wrote, [...] "At the bare minimum, The Walking Dead should be exciting, and the final moments of [...] "Bloodletting" [...] provides more than enough action." [...] Echoing similar sentiments, Catherine Gee of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars, and compared it to the second season premiere, opining: [...] "It may have been a calmer episode but there was no shortage of story to chew on." [...] Joe Oesterle of Mania.com commended the opening sequence of the episode, and praised the performances of Lincoln and Bernthal. Oesterle wrote, [...] "Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal [...] gave a fine bit of acting, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> interesting how the character Rick started looking and walking a little bit zombish after giving blood. The scenes between the two men were moving, and if you listened close you could decipher the main differences between these two cowboy cops. Rick is bound and determined to get back to his wife and let her know their son is in mortal danger, without ever doubting his own ability to successfully complete the mission, while Shane on the other hand is not quite as automatically selfless and heroic." [...] In conclusion, Oesterle gave [...] "Bloodletting" [...] a 'B' grade. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8.5 out of ten, signaling a [...] "great" [...] response. Goldman stated that it was an improvement over the last episode, and that it had a great scare moment and cliffhanger. Similarly, Paste Josh Jackson gave the episode an 8.3 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Steve West of Cinema Blend expressed that [...] "Bloodletting" [...] was superior to the previous episode, opining that it was [...] "a character strengthening episode." [...] He continued: [...] "Even those throwaway threads are immensely important to what’s about to go down at the Green farm." ...|$|E

500|$|Longtime scout Charlie Metro {{remembered the}} havoc caused by Henderson: '"I {{did a lot}} of study <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> that <b>it's</b> {{impossible}} to throw Rickey Henderson out. I started using stopwatches <b>and</b> everything. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> was impossible to throw some other guys out also. They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Iranian deputy culture minister, Javad Shamaqdari, offered effusive {{praise of}} the poem {{in a letter to}} Grass: [...] "I have read your {{literary}} work, highly responsible both from a human and historical point of view, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> extremely timely. Telling the truth in such a way may truly awaken the west's silent and dormant conscience". And Iran's state-owned Press TV said: [...] "Never before in Germany's postwar history has a prominent intellectual attacked Israel in such a courageous way. Metaphorically speaking, the poet has launched a deadly lyrical strike against Israel." ...|$|E
2500|$|A guitar-dominated album, its {{musical styles}} range from thrash, art pop and power pop to {{psychedelic}} folk featuring acoustic guitar. Pitchfork described Red Barked Tree as a [...] "shrewdly sequenced album", a necessity {{arising from the}} variety of different styles represented on it: [...] "its 11 songs {{are more or less}} positioned along a logical arc, where a sense of ominous unease gives way to violent release before simmering into a peaceful comedown". Grey stated in an interview with The Quietus, [...] "I was asked to propose a track sequence for the album, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> difficult initially. Then I realised that if I thought of the tracks as a series of scenes in a play or a film, it made it easier. I like the idea of the tracks telling a story: the story was the album from beginning to end." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Rob Liefeld, one of Image's co-founders, {{split from}} the {{publisher}} and formed his own company Awesome Entertainment, he hired Moore {{to create a new}} universe for the characters he had brought with him from Image. Moore's [...] "solution was breathtaking and cocky – he created a long and distinguished history for these new characters, retro-fitting a fake silver and gold age for them." [...] Moore began writing comics for many of these characters, such as Glory and Youngblood, as well as a three-part mini-series known as Judgment Day to provide a basis for the Awesome Universe. Moore was not satisfied with Liefeld, saying [...] "I just got fed up with the unreliability of information that I get from him, that I didn't trust him. I didn't think that he was respecting the work <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> hard to respect him. And also by then I was probably feeling that with the exception of Jim Lee, Jim Valentino – people like that – that a couple of the Image partners were seeming, to my eyes, to be less than gentlemen. They were seeming to be not necessarily the people I wanted to deal with." ...|$|E

2500|$|I was {{operated}} on that afternoon. As soon as I woke the surgeon, John Bartlett, {{was sitting on}} the end of my bed to tell me the bi-op was malignant... John found it hard to tell me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> hard to accept... I had to ring Mum and Dad in Deniliquin to tell them there was some bad news. Somehow you float through it even though you are scared s---less... The hardest part is the initial part, once you know what's in front of you it gets better. I don't want to trivialise cancer in any way. You have to let the emotion out then sit down and become realistic ... I never asked if my life was in the balance. My parents taught me, my school taught me, sport taught me but in particular cancer taught me that trust is the most powerful emotion we have. I trusted my doctors and nurses implicitly. It was amazing what I learnt about the power of the mind and how important trust is... There were the [...] "how in the hell did I get it?" [...] moments. No one knows, it could have been getting hit in a footy game or a cricket ball 10 years earlier.|$|E

I had been superciliously pushed aside, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>I</b> was angry. Something {{was about to be}} torn from me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>I</b> loved <b>it.</b>|$|R
