40|$|Rwanda has {{experienced}} an impressive increase in contraceptive use and fertility decline {{during the last}} decade. Between 2005 and 2010, the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) has risen from 17 % to 52 %, reducing unmet need and the total fertility substantially (from 6. 1 to 4. 6 children per women). This sharp increase has raised many questions. Which barriers to contraceptive use have been removed? Did the demand for modern contraceptive change as well? To what extent were the conditions for this change specific for Rwanda, and could other countries learn from the Rwandan experience? To respond to these questions, this thesis has examined the demand for and the barriers to family planning in Rwanda in 2005, a period of low contraceptive use and high unmet need. It analysed the progress made between 2005 and 2010 {{with the aim of}} informing and guiding policymakers to design and implement efficient future family planning policies enabling to sustain and accelerate the ongoing change. Data from the 2005 and 2010 Rwanda Demographic and Health Surveys are analysed by applying quantitative methods. Results have shown that in 2005, excess fertility was substantial in Rwanda indicating a high level of demand for family planning compared to that in neighbouring countries (Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya). This lower fertility preference stems principally from poverty. Contrary to couples in many other agrarian African societies, Rwandan parents see a large offspring as a burden rather than as <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> <b>workforce.</b> Pressure on resources resulting from land scarcity and high population density, has reduced the expected benefits from children. Awareness of excess fertility was found among all segments of the population, irrespective of educational level, economic status or religious affiliation. As the demand for contraception was high and the contraceptive use was low, unmet need for family planning was the highest found in Africa. This huge unmet need was associated with various factors: attitudes towards family planning (insufficient knowledge, lack of discussion between partners on the topic, fear for negative side effects, religious objections), poverty among {{the majority of the population}} (financial constraints), and low access to family planning services as the infrastructure for reproductive health services was badly damaged during the 1990 - 1994 civil war, genocide and its aftermath. The impressive increase in contraceptive use - explaining the ongoing fertility transition in Rwanda – did not arise from socio-economic development, but is linked more to poverty and deprivation that offered a fertile soil to family planning sensitizing campaigns. The study recommends further improvement in reproductive health services and continued advocacy to avoid the remaining unwanted pregnancies and to accelerate the socio-economic development that the government aspires for...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} based on an {{innovative}} demonstration project which trialled the implementation of the Finnish ‘workability’ framework and research measures. It aimed, firstly, to test the applicability of the Workability Index (WAI) to the Australian residential aged care workforce, focusing on personal care assistants (PCAs), and secondly, to assess the effectiveness of actions aimed at improving workability. The facility manager implemented multidimensional ‘actions’ according to the workability framework. The Workability Survey (WAS) and WAI and intervention instruments were administered (n = 64). Completed responses to ‘pre’ and ‘post’ instruments formed matched pairs (n = 15) which were analysed. The WAI increased by 3 points after all ‘actions’ were implemented, providing a statistically significant result. The only significant ‘action’ was increasing the number of PCAs in high care. Workability provides <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> research <b>workforce</b> development instrument measuring interactions between aged care workers and organisational demands and the outcomes of ‘actions’...|$|R
30|$|According to this perspective, the {{dividing}} line between a peripheral and core workforce developed in particular after World War II. This assessment is controversial, as other authors point out that firm-centered labor market segmentation set in at a much earlier stage. Schmiede (1986) and Schudlich (1994) both emphasize that a personnel policy at company level, aiming at keeping a certain workforce within the firm, existed already {{since the beginning of}} the industrialization process. They argue that already during the time of early factories, the owners attempted to keep their master craftsmen. Similarly, as Pierenkemper (1981) states, the segmentation of the (internal) labor market of large companies constituted a permanent problem, arising already decades before the World War I (Pierenkemper 1981, p.  5). Likewise, Littler (1982) points to the existence of this personnel policy during the very beginning of capitalist societies. Thereafter, the assessment made by Lutz is highly questionable. However, after the loss of territory, many displaced people fled to West Germany. Additionally, due to the emergence of a communist government in East Germany, known as the German Democratic Republic (DDR), many parts of West Germany attracted series of refugees. Those people were grown up in urban areas and often were more educated than people from rural areas. Owing to their experiences within the industrial production and organization processes, they formed a pool of <b>a</b> highly <b>useful</b> <b>workforce</b> by taking on nearly every workplace they could get (Lutz 1987, p.  204 – 205).|$|R

40|$|The New Zealand Government Railways Department {{undertook}} {{a wide range}} of reforms in the 1920 s as a result of concerns about the threat of road competition and the longevity of New Zealand’s railway infrastructure. Some of these reforms were structural and financial, but many were motivated by desires to create a more efficient, modern and <b>useful</b> <b>workforce.</b> Unmarried men made up a third of the NZGRD’s workforce in 1927 and this thesis is an investigation of how the management of the NZGRD attempted to mould them.

The complexity of care, budgetary restraints {{and demand for}} high-quality patient care have ignited the need for transparent hospital workforce planning. Nurses from 12 wards of two university hospitals were trained to test {{the reliability of the}} OPCq by investigating the absolute agreement of nursing care intensity (NCI) measurements among nurses. Validity was tested by assessing whether optimal NCI/nurse ratio, as calculated by a regression analysis in RAFAELA, was realistic. System feasibility was investigated through a questionnaire among all nurses involved. Almost 67 000 NCI measurements were performed between December 2013 and June 2014. Agreement using the OPCq varied between 38 % and 91 %. For only 1 in 12 wards was the optimal NCI area calculated judged as valid. Although the majority of respondents was positive about the applicability and user-friendliness, RAFAELA was not accepted as <b>useful</b> <b>workforce</b> planning system.
