5|$|<b>A</b> <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> {{suggests}} that self-control {{is akin to}} a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact {{that can be a}} source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E

2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> {{has found}} key {{points of the}} {{biological}} argument to be groundless. [...] For example, it was asserted {{for over a century}} that women were not as intellectually competent as men because they have slightly smaller brains on average. However, no substantiated significant difference in average intelligence has been found between the sexes. However men have a greater variability in intelligence and except in tests of reading comprehension, perceptual speed, and associative memory, males typically outnumber females substantially among high-scoring individuals. Furthermore, no discrepancy in intelligence is assumed between men of different heights, even though on average taller men have been found to have slightly larger brains. Feminists assert that although women may excel in certain areas and men in others, women are just as competent as men.|$|E
2500|$|Bullying is abusive social {{interaction}} between peers which can include aggression, harassment, and violence. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted {{by those who}} are in a position of power over the victim. <b>A</b> <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a set of abilities related to the understanding, use and management of emotion as it relates to one's self and others. Mayer et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: [...] "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion". The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes. Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems {{to play an important role}} in both bullying behavior and victimization in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.|$|E

He has written that “products of biotechnology are being rammed into our food, onto our fields and into our medicines, without any public participation in discussions and with the complicity, indeed, the active support and funding of governments. But there are profound health, ecological and economic ramifications of this activity.” In a 1999 CP Wire article, Suzuki is quoted as saying: [...] "Any politician or scientist who tells you these products are safe is either very stupid or lying." [...] In an interview with CBC TV, Suzuki argues that the science showing GMOs are safe is [...] "very, very bad science" [...] and that the commercialization of GMOs is “driven by money.” His foundation’s website includes an “Understanding GMO” page which claims, “the safety of GMO foods is unproven and <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> connects these foods with health concerns.” ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{limitation}} of any land management {{system is that}} economically and politically powerful users can easily quantify and argue their needs. It is harder to define the economic value of ecosystem services and, therefore, the ecosystems and people most dependent on them for their subsistence become voiceless and often neglected users. In theory Holistic Management framework addresses this issue, {{but it is not}} always seen in the field. Another common criticism of holistic planned grazing is that while farmers and ranchers around the world believe that it works for them and they have even received awards, the majority of range scientists {{have not been able to}} experimentally confirm that intensive grazing systems similar to those at the center of holistic management show a benefit, and claim that [...] managers' reports of success are anecdotal.

2500|$|The {{doctrine}} {{was stated}} again by Clinton in the culminating chapter of Hard Choices, her 2014 memoir {{of her time}} as secretary:...

This was a point lost on many of the men working across Washington's foreign policy establishment, but over the years I came to view it {{as one of the most}} compelling arguments for why standing up for women and girls was not just the right thing to do but also smart and strategic ... the correlation was undeniable, and <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> showed that improving conditions for women helped resolve conflicts and stabilize societies. [...] "Women's issues" [...] had long been relegated to the margins of U.S. foreign policy and international diplomacy, considered at best a nice thing to work on but hardly a necessity. I became convinced that, in fact, this was a cause that cut to the heart of our national security.|$|E

2500|$|Fluoxetine {{has been}} {{detected}} in aquatic ecosystems, especially in North America. There is <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> addressing {{the effects of}} fluoxetine (among other SSRIs) exposure on non-target aquatic species. [...] As of 2003 there was little research on environmental effects; the research showed little effects on aquatic plants at relevant exposure levels; toxicological studies had been done on the model fish, Medaka and found little effect on adult behavior or physiology, but developmental abnormalities were observed more frequently in spawn of fish that {{had been exposed to}} relevant doses. [...] Studies had also been conducted on mesocosms that included sunfish, that were exposed to three dose ranges of the combination of fluoxetine, ibuprofen, and ciprofloxacin, with the highest dose range set well beyond environmental exposures; [...] almost all the fish died at the doses in the highest ranges and half the fish died in the middle dose ranges, while almost none died in the low range and in the controls. [...] The reason for this was studied but the investigators were not able to identify the cause. [...] Subsequent studies showed that fluoxetine may be an endocrine disruptor in some fish species.|$|E
2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> {{indicates}} {{that exposure to}} distal stressors leads to proximal stressors in sexual minority populations. While sexual minority stress and gender minority stress both use Meyer's Minority Stress Model as a framework, and share some characteristics with gender minority stress, some researchers have suggested that sexual minority stress is distinct from the minority stress experienced by transgender, gender non-conforming, and gender non-binary individuals. [...] For example, LGB youth and adults who have experienced prejudice about their sexual orientation sometimes choose to conceal their sexual identity from others. Concealing such personal information causes significant psychological distress, including intrusive thoughts about the secret, shame and guilt, anxiety, and isolation from {{other members of the}} minority group. Internalized homophobia is another proximal stressor prevalent among LGBT individuals. [...] It refers to the internalization of negative social views about homosexuality, which leads to self-hatred and poor self-regard. As predicted by minority stress theory, internalized homophobia is associated with exposure to distal stressors, insofar as it only occurs because LGB individuals are exposed to negative societal attitudes toward same-sex attraction. Rejection sensitivity represents a third proximal stress among sexual minority individuals. [...] Rejection sensitivity refers to chronic, anxious expectations of rejection based on one's stigmatized status. [...] Among sexual minority individuals, rejection sensitivity emerges from experiences of rejection from parents and is associated with internalized homophobia, unassertiveness, depression, and anxiety. [...] Thus, previous experiences with prejudice are associated with proximal stress among LGB individuals, including concealment of their sexual identity, internalized homophobia, and rejection sensitivity.|$|E
