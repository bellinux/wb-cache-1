40|$|In {{the next}} {{generation}} of ATM, ADS-B(Automatic <b>Dependent</b> <b>Surveillance-Broadcast)</b> and multilateration are the main technology recommended by ICAO(International Civil Aviation Organization). However, {{there are a lot of}} non-equipped ADS-B aircraft today. Therefore, TIS-B(Traffic Information Service-Broadcast) provides traffic information, which has obtained from radars for non-equipped ADS-B aircraft. In this paper, we presented an onboard multilateration system for non-equipped ADS-B aircraft using SSR(Secondary Surveillance Radar) signal instead of TIS-B. TIS-B has a lot of error because of using radar data, but multilateration has less error than radar because of using TDOA(Time Difference of Arrival) method. Results of performanc...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAir traffic {{across the}} North Atlantic {{airspace}} has witnessed an incessant {{increase over the}} last decades. However, the efficiency of trans-Atlantic air traffic management is still low nowadays due to the limited radar coverage. Automated <b>Dependent</b> <b>Surveillance-Broadcast</b> systems represents an opportunity to enhance the strategic flight planning over the oceans by reducing separation standards between aircraft. Besides, the strong winds present a challenge for oceanic flights. Therefore, flying on the wind-optimal routes will save significantly both fuel and time. In this paper, we propose a new trans-Atlantic route structure that benefits from the jetstreams in order to construct wind-optimal flight trajectories. Then, we introduce an optimization model for detecting and resolving conflicts. The analysis is carried out on real traffic data to prove {{the efficiency of the}} proposed method. Experimental findings show an improvement in terms of conflict resolution and induced delays...|$|R
50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>surveillance-broadcast</b> (ADS-B) {{messages}} are transmitted from aircraft equipped with suitable transponders, containing {{information such as}} identity, location, and velocity.

5000|$|The {{aviation}} transponder interrogation modes are {{the standard}} formats of pulsed sequences from an interrogating Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) or similar <b>Automatic</b> <b>Dependent</b> <b>Surveillance-Broadcast</b> (ADS-B) system.

50|$|Also in 1997 the {{responsibility}} for air traffic control in Canada was transferred from Transport Canada to Nav Canada. The very large and complex control system operated by that organization uses a number of technologies, including 1400 ground-based navigation aids, 46 radars and six <b>Automatic</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>surveillance-broadcast</b> systems, {{which are based on}} global positioning technology.|$|E
5000|$|Air {{navigation}} {{coverage has}} recently been improved through the deployment of Automated <b>Dependent</b> <b>Surveillance-Broadcast</b> (ADS-B) technology in parts of northern Canada. First introduced in the Hudson Bay area in January 2009, the service will eventually be expanded to cover all of northern Canada. The technique {{involves the use of}} ground based transmitter/receivers and special electronic equipment aboard aircraft flying through northern airspace. This special equipment automatically transmits information relating to the aircraft position (determined by a GPS on the airplane) every second, to the ground based receiving station, a number of which are located in the north. The station then transmits this information to an area control centre, operated by Nav Canada, Canada's national air navigation system operator, where the it is displayed on [...] "radar" [...] screens which are used by air traffic controllers to monitor Canadian airspace.|$|R

50|$|In the Mode S {{secondary}} {{surveillance radar}} system, 'squitter' is a term used to describe messages that are unsolicited downlink transmissions from an <b>automatic</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>surveillance-broadcast</b> (ADS-B) Mode S transponder system. Mode S transponders transmit acquisition squitter (unsolicited downlink transmissions) to permit passive acquisition by interrogators with broad antenna beams, where active acquisition may be hindered by all-call synchronous garble.

40|$|AbstractAutomatic <b>dependent</b> <b>surveillance-{{broadcast}}</b> (ADS-B) {{systems can}} broadcast satellite-based aircraft position, identification, etc., periodically, {{and are now}} on track to replace radar to become the backbone of next-generation air traffic management (ATM) systems. However, ADS-B systems suffer severe cyber-security problems due to the broadcast-type data link {{and the lack of}} designed-in security measures. Especially, since ADS-B messages are unauthenticated, it is easy to insert fake aircraft into a system via spoofing or insertion of false messages. Unfortunately, the authentication for ADS-B messages has not yet been well studied. In this paper, based on identity-based signature with message recovery (IBS-MR), an efficient broadcast authentication scheme for ADS-B messages is proposed. The security analysis demonstrates that the scheme can achieve authenticity and integrity of ADS-B broadcast messages, as well as adaptive evolution of broadcasters’ private keys. The performance evaluation shows that the scheme is computationally efficient for typical avionics devices with limited resources. Furthermore, the scheme achieves low communication overhead since broadcast messages can be recovered from signatures, and thus it is suitable for low-bandwidth ADS-B data link...|$|R
