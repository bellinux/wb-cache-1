Other paths crossed it, but Walter avoided these, judging that the one he was on was as likely as another to lead him to the quarry. At length after an abrupt turn it led straight into a thicket of hemlocks, young growth.

50|$|The {{electronic}} personal dosimeter (EPD) is {{an electronic}} device {{that has a}} number of sophisticated functions, such as continual monitoring which allows <b>alarm</b> <b>warnings</b> at preset levels and live readout of dose accumulated. These are especially useful in high dose areas where residence time of the wearer is limited due to dose constraints. The dosimeter can be reset, usually after taking a reading for record purposes, and thereby re-used multiple times.|$|R

50|$|The {{radiation}} dosimeter is {{an important}} personal dose measuring instrument. It is worn by the person being monitored and is used to estimate the radiation dose deposited in the individual wearing the device. They are used for Gamma, X-ray, beta and other strongly penetrating radiation, but not for weakly penetrating radiation such as alpha particles. Traditionally film badges were used for long term monitoring, and quartz fibre dosimeters for short term monitoring. However, these are being superseded by such as thermoluminescent dosimetry badges and electronic dosimeters. Electronic dosimeters can give an <b>alarm</b> <b>warning</b> if a preset dose threshold has been reached, enabling safer working in potentially higher radiation levels, where the received dose must be continually monitored.|$|E

5000|$|A {{lightning}} prediction system detects {{atmospheric conditions}} {{likely to produce}} lightning strikes and sounds an <b>alarm,</b> <b>warning</b> those nearby that lightning is imminent and giving them the chance to find safety before the storm arrives in the area. Lightning protection systems are often installed in outdoor areas which are often congested with people, lack sufficient shelter, and are difficult to evacuate quickly (such as water parks, college campuses, and large swimming pool or athletic field complexes). These locations are particularly dangerous during lightning storms. Prediction systems are prone to false alarms as they respond to conditions that are not always attributed to a developing thunderstorm. Electric field data is typically {{used in conjunction with}} detection information to limit false positives.|$|E

Voga had drifted into the solar system 50 years before and had been captured by Jupiter's gravity. An asteroid of that size drifting between star systems could not support life and he warns against going down to Voga and spreading the plague. Warner logs the call anyway.

5000|$|During World War I and {{the period}} following, several {{technological}} advances {{contributed to the}} automation of lighthouses, rendering human occupancy unnecessary. A device for automatically replacing burned-out electric lamps in lighthouses was developed and placed in several light stations in 1916. A bell <b>alarm</b> <b>warning</b> keepers of fluctuations in the burning efficiency of oil-vapor lamps was developed in 1917. In the same year, the first experimental radiobeacon was installed in a lighthouse. The only lightvessel of the service sunk by enemy action was the LV-71 on August 6, 1918. After {{the sinking of the}} SS Merak by the [...] near Diamond Shoals, North Carolina LV-71 rescued the survivors but was sunk as well shortly thereafter.

5000|$|The {{instruments}} {{are designed to}} be hand-held, are battery powered and of low mass to allow easy manipulation. Other features include an easily readable display, in counts or radiation dose, and an audible indication of the count rate. This is usually the “click” associated with the Geiger type instrument, and can also be an <b>alarm</b> <b>warning</b> sound when a rate of radiation counts or dose has been exceeded. For dual channel detectors such as the scintillation detector it is normal to generate different sounds for alpha and beta. This gives the operator rapid feedback on both the level of radiation and the type of particle being detected. These features allow the user to concentrate on manipulation of the meter whilst having auditory feedback of the rate of radiation detected. [...] Meters can be fully integrated with probe and processing electronics in one housing to allow single-handed use, or have separate detector probe and electronics housings, joined by a signal cable. This latter is preferred for checking of convoluted surfaces for radioactive contamination due to the ease of manipulating the probe.|$|E
50|$|A {{fire alarm}} system {{has a number of}} devices working {{together}} to detect and warn people through visual and audio appliances when smoke, fire, carbon monoxide or other emergencies are present. These alarms may be activated automatically from smoke detectors, and heat detectors or may also be activated via manual fire alarm activation devices such as manual call points or pull stations. Alarms can be either motorized bells or wall mountable sounders or horns. They can also be speaker strobes which sound an alarm, followed by a voice evacuation message which warns people inside the building not to use the elevators. Fire alarm sounders can be set to certain frequencies and different tones including low, medium and high, depending on the country and manufacturer of the device. Most {{fire alarm system}}s in Europe sound like a siren with alternating frequencies. Fire alarm sounders in the United States and Canada can be either continuous or set to different codes such as Code 3. Fire <b>alarm</b> <b>warning</b> devices can also be set to different volume levels. Smaller buildings may have the alarm set to a lower volume and larger buildings may have alarms set to a higher level.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the Dufour’s gland is to secrete chemicals, but {{the nature of the}} {{secretions}} and their function differs in various hymenopteran groups. The secretion is often used in communication to mark members of the colony, to mark hosts (parasitic wasps), during slave raids (ants), for territory marking (ants), to signal fertility, to attract a member of the opposite sex, to give an <b>alarm</b> <b>warning</b> (ants) or to mark a trail (ants). This use of scent marking pheromones secreted by Dufour's gland is observed in the carpenter bee Xylocopa pubescens to mark flowers and nests. Other functions include lubricating the valves of the ovipositor during egg-laying, serving as a component of material used to build the nest, serving as a food for the developing larvae and being mixed with pollen and nectar to provision the brood cell before egg-laying. For instance, the well developed Dufour's gland {{is one of the main}} physical characteristics of a social wasp Parischnogaster mellyi, and the abundant abdominal secretion from the gland has been found to play an important role in egg development and oviposition. The gland is well-developed in various solitary mining bees where it is used to waterproof and make fungus-resistant the lining of the brood cells.|$|E

Upon landing, the pilot runs away, telling Ringer {{that she is}} an idiot and they were instructed not to kill her because Vosch wanted her to return. He then screams to the soldiers that the helicopter has a bomb. Cassie (now dressed in a soldier uniform) runs one way as Ringer runs another. Ringer detonates the first bomb and in the confusion Cassie is able to hide among the troops. Cassie and Ringer plan {{to make it to}} the command center from opposite directions. As Cassie makes her way there, Ringer sets off additional bombs to continue causing chaos. During Cassie's travels she continuously hears an <b>alarm</b> <b>warning</b> that General Order 4 will commence in 5 minutes and all forces are to head to their designated safe areas. Not knowing what it means, she continues to fight more troops as she proceeds forward. Upon making it to the last door (where she is too wait for Ringer to reunite with her) General Order 4 activates. All the lights in the base go dark. Cassie, still not understanding, assumes the order was to blackout the base. While waiting for Ringer, the sprinkler system goes off. Cassie assumes the bombing must have set it off and thinks nothing of it, within a few minutes Cassie's skin begins to burn and boils appear. She realizes General Order 4 is a small version of the first three waves used as a defense mechanism for the base. Power goes out, water floods and disease as poison is spread. In burning pain, she runs towards a window and shoots it out. Now outside, she rolls around in the dirt to try and get the poison off her skin.|$|E
