40|$|Samples of Nd–Fe–B were {{coated with}} {{bismaleimide}} (BMI), a resin which {{is well known}} for its desirable barrier, mechanical, and thermal properties but has not been used as a coating material. The performance of BMI-coated samples (<b>average</b> <b>coating</b> thickness ~ 15 μm) was compared with commercial epoxy-coated samples (<b>average</b> <b>coating</b> thickness ~ 20 μm) in a series of tests. In the copper-accelerated acetic acid–salt spray test, the epoxy-coated samples failed badly (damaged area > 50 %) within 20 h while the BMI-coated samples showed no sign of failure up to 200 h. Using the cross-cut tape test for adhesion strength (ASTM D 3359), the commercial epoxy coatings suffered 25 % area detachment while for the BMI coatings, no detachment was observed. The scratch resistance of the BMI coatings, measured in terms of scratch depth in the pin scratch test, was about 1. 5 that of the commercial epoxy coatings, and the Vickers hardness was higher by a factor of about 2. 5. When magnetized under the same magnetizing field, {{there was no significant difference}} in the magnetization obtained among bare, epoxy-coated, and BMI-coated samples. These results suggest that BMI coatings are excellent for protection of the Nd–Fe–B magnets against corrosion and function better than the commonly used epoxy resin.

40|$|Dip coating is a {{very common}} process in food manufacturing. Controlling the {{thickness}} of the coating is key to deliver the desired sensorial properties and to be compliant with the product’s nutritional claims. Whilst dip coating with Newtonian liquids is physically well understood, coating food products almost invariably involve liquids with more complex rheology. This makes the process more difficult to design and control and reduces the coating homogeneity. Developing novel food products with improved nutritional attributes often calls for reducing the coating thickness and non-homogeneity should be avoided to guarantee the quality of the final product. In this study, we focused on the coating of a flat surface using Carbopol solutions and a commercial ketchup, following a Herschel-Bulkley rheological model. The final <b>average</b> <b>coating</b> thickness was always significantly lower than the critical thickness that can be estimated from liquid density and yield stress. Liquids with a yield stress in the range 4 - 56 Pa were considered in this study and the steady withdrawal speed from the bath was varied in the range 0. 1 - 20 mm/s. The resulting <b>average</b> <b>coating</b> thickness and its uniformity are discussed. The results are interpreted {{in the context of an}} existing theory for dip coating with liquids with a yield stress. This study paves the way toward an integrated design of the coating process and the liquid rheology of foods, such as chocolate or ketchup. This can enable the development of new food products allying improved nutrition, a consumer preferred sensory profile and cost...|$|E

Purpose: This present study tested a Maritech® extract formulation, containing a blend of extracts from three different species of brown algae, plus nutrients in an open label combined phase I and II pilot scale study to determine both acute safety and efficacy in osteoarthritis of the knee. Patients and methods: Participants (n = 12, five females [mean age, 62 ± 11. 06 years] and seven males [mean age, 57. 14 ± 9. 20 years]) with a confirmed diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee were randomized to either 100 mg (n = 5) or 1000 mg (n = 7) of a Maritech® extract formulation per day. The formulation contained Maritech® seaweed extract containing Fucus vesiculosis (85 % w/w), Macrocystis pyrifera (10 % w/w) and Laminaria japonica (5 % w/w) plus vitamin B 6, zinc and manganese. Primary outcome was the average comprehensive arthritis test (COAT) score which is comprised of four sub-scales: pain, stiffness, difficulty with physical activity and overall symptom severity measured weekly. Safety measures included full blood count, serum lipids, liver function tests, urea, creatinine and electrolytes determined at baseline and week 12. All adverse events were recorded. Results: Eleven participants completed 12 weeks and one completed 10 weeks of the study. Using a multilevel linear model, the <b>average</b> <b>COAT</b> score was reduced by 18 % for the 100 mg treatment and 52 % for the 1000 mg dose {{at the end of the}} study. There was a clear dose response effect seen between the two treatments (P≤ 0. 0005) on the <b>average</b> <b>COAT</b> score and each of the four COAT subscales (pain, stiffness, difficulty with physical activity and overall symptom severity) (P≤ 0. 05). The preparation was well tolerated and the few adverse events were unlikely to be related to the study medication. There were no changes in blood parameters measured over the course of the study with the exception of an increase in serum albumin which was not clinically significant. Conclusion: The seaweed extract nutrient complex when taken orally over twelve weeks decreased the symptoms of osteoarthritis in a dose-dependent manner. It was demonstrated to be safe to use over the study period at the doses tested. The efficacy of the preparation now needs to be demonstrated in a phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT).

50|$|The {{sandwich}} and operations are intriguing in design. Every day, the lunchroom prepares 100-150 lbs of ground beef. The grind is finer than standard store ground beef. Attempts {{to use a}} coarser grind were immediately noticed by the patrons and rejected {{in favor of the}} finer grind. The sandwich is served on an oversized custom made hamburger bun that is cut and left hinged just prior to making the sandwich. The sandwich is placed in a custom wax paper wrapper that has a thicker than <b>average</b> wax <b>coating</b> for extra protection. A teaspoon is traditionally included with the sandwich to scoop out any remaining beef from the paper after finishing the sandwich.|$|R
40|$|Porod {{plots of}} the small-angle X-ray intensities {{scattered}} by porous silicas that have undergone different coating processes show {{deviations from the}} predicted constant asymptotic behaviour. The deviations are ascribed {{to the effect of}} the coating film. We propose a constant-electron-density model for these films. The theoretical scattering function calculated from the model permits an estimate of the film thickness, electron density and <b>average</b> number of <b>coating</b> molecules per unit area of the support...|$|R
40|$|The {{transfer}} of {{molecules from the}} cell surface to the early endosomes is mediated by preendosomal vesicles. These vesicles, which have pinched off completely from the plasma membrane but not yet fused with endosomes, form the earliest compartment along the endocytic route. Using a new assay to distinguish between free and cell surface connected vesicle profiles, we have characterized the preedosomal compartment ultrastructurally. Our basic experimental setup was labeling of the entire cell surface at 4 degrees C with Con A-gold, warming of the cells to 37 degrees C to allow endocytosis, followed by replacing incubation medium with fixative, all within either 30 or 60 s. Then the fixed cells were incubated with anti-Con A-HRP to distinguish truly free (gold labeled) endocytic vesicles from surface- connected structures. Finally, analysis of thin (20 - 30 nm) serial sections and quantification of vesicle diameters were carried out. Based on this approach it is shown that the preendosomal compartment comprises both clathrin-coated and non-coated endocytic vesicles with approximately the same frequency but with distinct diameter distributions, the average noncoated vesicle being smaller (95 nm) than the <b>average</b> <b>coated</b> one (110 nm). In parallel experiments, using an anti- transferrin receptor gold-conjugate as a specific marker for clathrin- dependent endocytosis it is also shown that uncoating of coated vesicles plays only a minor role for the total frequency of noncoated vesicles. Furthermore, after perturbation of clathrin-dependent endocytosis by potassium depletion where uptake of transferrin is blocked, noncoated endocytic vesicles with Con A-gold, but not coated vesicles, exist already after 30 and 60 s. Finally, it is shown {{that the existence of}} small, free vesicles in the short-time experiments cannot be ascribed to recycling from the early endosomes...|$|R
