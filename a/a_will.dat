5|$|For Kant a {{good will}} is a broader {{conception}} than <b>a</b> <b>will</b> which acts from duty. <b>A</b> <b>will</b> which acts from duty is distinguishable as <b>a</b> <b>will</b> which overcomes hindrances {{in order to}} keep the moral law. A dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will which becomes visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E
5|$|A {{secret trust}} is an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee to benefit a person {{without having to}} specify that person in <b>a</b> <b>will.</b> The trustee is transferred property {{under the terms of}} the will which he or she then holds on trust for others.|$|E

5|$|Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, {{suggests}} {{the potential for}} a third class of secret trust. This is where the dying person is encouraged not to make <b>a</b> <b>will</b> so that his property passes to the next-of-kin, on the agreement that the next-of-kin give effect to his wishes via a secret trust. If this is the case, the next-of-kin would be obliged to hold the property on trust and fulfil the dying person's wishes.|$|E
5|$|As {{a general}} rule, {{there is no}} {{requirement}} for particular formalities in trust instruments, they can be oral or written. The only requirement is that they show an intention to create a trust. The exceptions are where it is a transfer of land, the transfer of existing equitable interests, or where the trust is made in <b>a</b> <b>will.</b>|$|E

50|$|Recompense, under {{compulsory}} purchase, is {{not necessarily}} a monetary payment of open market value (see James v United Kingdom 1986), but in most cases a sum equivalent to a valuation made as if between <b>a</b> <b>willing</b> seller and <b>a</b> <b>willing</b> purchaser will fall due to the previous owner.|$|R

5|$|Chauncey Thomas died at {{his home}} in Shohola on October 5, 1882, sixteen years after the new bridge was repaired. Since Thomas had never written <b>a</b> <b>will,</b> estate and {{property}} were divided between his children and his grandchildren. A friend to the Thomas family, Stephen St. John Gardiner, became the administrator of the estate. With the job, Gardiner was able to buy the bridge. He became controller and majority of the bridge's stock.|$|E
5|$|Following an 1866 {{conflict}} between the increasingly authoritarian Cuza and the political class, various trends organized a coup which brought Prince Carol, a Hohenzollern, to the Romanian throne—echoing <b>a</b> <b>will</b> expressed {{by some of the}} 1848 activists to have a foreign dynasty rule over a unified state.

5|$|The Latinised form, Wornesell, {{appears in}} the Kent Hundred Rolls of 127475 and in a mediaeval will {{recorded}} in September 1409.

Jason Lee chaired the first meeting organised {{to discuss the matter}} on the 17th. He proposed the creation of an authority over the pioneers centered on a governor. French-Canadian settlers blocked the measure and instead a probate judge and a few other positions were appointed.|$|E

The distance from the band, coupled with the more relaxed writing process for Tea & Sympathy helped Fanning to unwind from the stress left over from 10 years working recording and touring with Powderfinger.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} passing of noble titles or ranks, {{inheritance}} practices did not involve primogeniture; each son received an equal share of the family property. Unlike the practice in later dynasties, the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune. Daughters received {{a portion of the}} family fortune through their marriage dowries, though this was usually much less than the shares of sons. A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in <b>a</b> <b>will,</b> but it is unclear how common this was.|$|E
5|$|As {{a form of}} express trust, {{charitable}} trusts {{are subject}} to certain formalities, {{as well as the}} requirements of the three certainties, when being created. These vary depending on whether the gift that creates the trust is given in life, given after death, or includes land. If the gift is given after death through <b>a</b> <b>will,</b> the will must comply with Section 9 of the Wills Act 1837, which requires that the will be in writing and signed by the testator (or somebody else present, at the testator's instruction), {{it is clear that the}} testator intended to give effect to the will, and the signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses. If these are all carried out, the will is a valid document, and the gift made as part of it can create a charitable trust. If the gift is of land and made during the donor's lifetime, it must comply with Section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, which requires that the agreement be a written document signed by the person giving it. If the gift is of personal property and made inter vivos, there are no formal requirements; it is enough that an oral declaration is made creating the trust. Once constituted properly, a charitable trust, like all express trusts, cannot be undone unless there is something allowing that within the trust instrument.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{genetic drift}} {{is the only}} {{evolutionary}} force acting on an allele, {{at any given time}} the probability that an allele will eventually become fixed in the population is simply its frequency in the population at that time.
