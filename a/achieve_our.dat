Fiat released a statement stating: [...] "Both commercials featuring Jennifer Lopez were indeed filmed in the Bronx as well as outside locations. As you may know, in today's world, people are increasingly mobile and their work takes them to a variety of locations. As a result, we took the opportunity to film wherever Ms. Lopez was working at the time to accommodate her schedule. The commercial tells the story of how the simple elements of our upbringing can help explain who we are, where we're going and serve as a source of inspiration to <b>achieve</b> <b>our</b> goals in life.

2500|$|Kelly Johnson, {{founder of}} Lockheed Skunk Works, and {{developer}} of the U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird family of spy planes, commented on escape crew capsules when discussing {{development of the}} YF-12A (Blackbird) ejection seat: [...] "We set ourselves a very high goal in providing crew escape systems. We were determined to develop a system good for zero escape velocity {{on the ground and}} through the complete flight spectrum, having speeds above Mach 3 at 100,000 feet. We did <b>achieve</b> <b>our</b> design goals.... I have never been convinced that a capsule ejection is required for anything other than high velocity re-entry from outer space. Our escape system in a very important sense really provides a capsule, which is the pressure suit, which is surely capable of meeting the speeds and temperatures likely to be encountered in the near future of manned aircraft." [...] Rather than using escape capsules, SR-71 and U-2 pilots wore full pressure suits for high-altitude ejections. The suits were also heat-resistant so that SR-71 pilots could survive the high temperatures generated from a Mach 3 ejection.|$|E

2500|$|Within the church, {{there have}} also been a number of {{unofficial}} statements regarding gender. For example, [...] "Strengthening Our Families: An In-Depth Look at the Proclamation on the Family" [...] (a book compiled by the School of Family Life at the church-owned Brigham Young University) states, [...] "Although we do not fully understand the eternal nature of gender, we should acknowledge its meaning and purpose, and humbly seek to understand and appreciate the nature of divine gender distinctions in God's plan for His children." [...] The book also states: God created us male and female. This is not a mistake or a variety of genetic or hormonal chance. What we call gender is an essential characteristic of our existence prior to our birth. Gender is part of our eternal identity and essential to our eternal progression. Although we may not know all the reasons why this is so, we do know some of the reasons why gender is essential to our eternal progression. To <b>achieve</b> <b>our</b> exaltation, an eternal marriage {{between a man and a}} woman is necessary. ...The sexual union between a married man and woman is, among other things, the means God has ordained to bring His spirit children into mortality, which is an essential step in the plan of salvation.|$|E
