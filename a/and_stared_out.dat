40|$|Two women {{stand on}} plinths <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> into the crowd. One {{is dressed in}} white, one in black. Projected {{on the wall behind}} the women is a {{changing}} series of words. These words; abusive, vulgar, shocking, angry, suggest the rage the women cannot discuss in ordinary situations. As the words progress through the projected alphabet of cussing, so does their anger...|$|R
6000|$|I {{could think}} of nothing else. I could not study, I could only sit <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of the window with tears running down my cheeks, until at last, the teacher observing my distress, inquired, [...] "What is the matter?" [...] And I, not knowing how to enter upon so terrible a tale, whined out, [...] "I'm sick, I want to go home." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bailey {{was born}} in Ponteland, near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and was brought up there.

It was completed {{towards the end of}} his life, between 1465 and 1470, and is held in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin.

50|$|Back at Susan's, {{she asks}} Felicia {{to try a}} fresh batch of brownies that they both made (with Felicia {{poisoning}} the batter) and Felicia hesitantly eats a full brownie, and promptly vomits in her handbag. Later when Susan was feeding Paul, she tells him that her and Mike were ready to move back into their house, causing Paul {{to believe that she}} didn't actually care about him, and that she just wanted her house back. He then throws her <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> the window angrily. He then collapses on the floor.|$|R
60|$|He stopped <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> at me. I {{felt all}} that foolish {{incapacity}} an Englishman feels on such occasions.

When at last I looked at him he was sitting back in his corner, his arms folded and his teeth gnawing at his knuckles.|$|R

60|$|Her laugh, as she retreated, {{was worse}} than her cry; worse than the burst of {{imbecile}} lamentation in which it ended; worse than the doting air with which she sat down in her old seat, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> at the darkness.|$|E
60|$|Edward Cossey did not reject this {{suggestion}} with the contempt {{that might have}} been expected; on the contrary he appeared to be turning the matter over in his mind, for he drummed a little tune with his knuckles <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of the window.|$|E
50|$|As protesters {{outside of}} the prison shout for {{the freedom of the}} Saints, Connor <b>and</b> Murphy <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of their window at the sea of prisoners in the yard, finding that they'll have plenty of work while they wait to be freed.|$|R
60|$|He {{signed for}} silence, <b>and</b> Breckenridge <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> through the glasses, for he feared his face would betray him, and fancied he {{understood}} the burden that was upon the man who, because it seemed the lesser evil, was risking eight men's lives.|$|R
6000|$|... "You arouse my curiosity," [...] said Arthur, {{speaking}} quietly, {{so as not}} to be overheard in the far corner. [...] "If I {{hear more}} ecstatic praises of these girls I shall turn around <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> them <b>out</b> of countenance." ...|$|R

60|$|She paused, {{looking at}} me even more strangely than before, till I turned my eyes, indeed, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> at the sea, wishing that I were in it, or {{anywhere}} away from this lovely and imperious woman whom I was sworn to obey in all things.|$|E
60|$|The slatternly general servant re{{appeared}} {{with the}} chops and tinned salmon {{he had asked}} Madam Gadow to prepare for them.

5000|$|Born in Brooklyn of Catholic and Protestant descent, he {{said his}} father [...] "did nothing, never worked, a manic {{depressive}} who used to sit by the window <b>and</b> just <b>stare</b> <b>out.</b> We used to live on Home Relief. My brother David and I went begging for food." ...|$|R
50|$|Day 6: ShatterdayA {{very ill}} Peter is {{lying in the}} hotel room when his alter ego arrives. His alter ego tells him {{that it is time to}} come to terms with the fact that he is being replaced, and that he is {{becoming}} a memory. Peter goes to the window <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>out.</b> His alter ego reveals that things are going well with him, and that he has put his life in order.

60|$|Often {{during the}} weeks that {{followed}} he dwelt in her mind as she sat at her desk <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> across the river, and several times that summer she started to walk to Silliston.

60|$|He {{turned his}} back upon it <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of the window over the trees and greenery.

500|$|Fowles {{described}} his main inspiration for The French Lieutenant's Woman to be a persistent {{image of a}} 'Victorian Woman,' who later developed into the novel's titular character Sarah Woodruff. In a 1969 essay titled [...] "Notes on an Unfinished Novel," [...] Fowles reflects on his writing process.

They sang at the 1969 March on Washington, which Mr. Yarrow helped to organize. Though their activism provoked a steady stream of death threats, they were never harmed. [...] "But for years, I used to bite my fingernails on stage," [...] Mary Travers says.
