5|$|Flashbang Studios {{had planned}} to earn money from {{creating}} casual games {{so that they could}} create <b>a</b> <b>quirky</b> game without having to worry about sales and sustaining the studio. Although the company failed to create a financially successful casual game, by creating software for other companies they managed to acquire enough money to undertake an unusual project of their own choosing.|$|E
5|$|Edward had {{a normal}} {{upbringing}} for {{a member of}} a royal family. The prince was interested in horses and horsebreeding, and became a good rider; he also liked dogs, in particular greyhounds. In his letters, he shows <b>a</b> <b>quirky</b> sense of humour, joking about sending unsatisfactory animals to his friends, such as horses who disliked carrying their riders, or lazy hunting dogs too slow to catch rabbits. He was not particularly interested in hunting or falconry, both popular activities in the 14th century. He enjoyed music, including Welsh music and the newly invented crwth instrument, as well as musical organs. He did not take part in jousting, either because he lacked the aptitude or because he had been banned from participating for his personal safety, but he was certainly supportive of the sport.|$|E

5000|$|According to Madison Taylor, {{an editor}} of Times-News, the serial has detractors and fans among the paper readers. Some dislike serials, some desire more humor and less intrigue. Some like it because [...] "it’s {{different}} than anything else" [...] Times-News publishes and [...] "it's also got <b>an</b> <b>quirky</b> sense of humor." ...|$|R

25|$|Mental As Anything {{is arguably}} {{comparable}} with contemporaneous British acts Madness, Squeeze, XTC and Nick Lowe in that their classic pop meets new wave music is typically delivered with <b>a</b> <b>quirky,</b> ironic sense of humour and a decidedly local flavour.|$|E
25|$|The show also {{featured}} Mylo Williams (T.K. Carter), a maintenance supervisor, and Miss Tina Paladrino (Joan Ryan), <b>a</b> <b>quirky</b> teacher {{and friend of}} Miss Bliss, with whom she would often discuss her personal life, with Miss Paladrino acting as sounding board. Dennis Haskins played the school principal, Mr. Richard Belding.|$|E
25|$|The Alton Towers Hotel {{opened on}} 10 April 1996 and is themed to the {{eccentric}} fictional character Sir Algenon Alton and his travels. The rooms are decorated in <b>a</b> <b>quirky</b> English style {{with pictures of}} Sir Algenon's inventions. The hotel is four star and has 180 rooms. The hotel was the first phase in a plan to turn the theme park into a multi-day resort.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, {{the team}} was {{purchased}} by media magnate Ted Turner, owner of superstation WTBS, {{as a means to}} keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta. The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment. It was then that Atlanta Stadium was renamed Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium. Turner quickly gained a reputation as <b>a</b> <b>quirky,</b> hands-on baseball owner.|$|E
25|$|Feingold won by {{positioning}} {{himself as}} <b>a</b> <b>quirky</b> underdog who offered voters {{an alternative to}} what was {{seen by many as}} negative campaigning of opponents Jim Moody and Joe Checota. On primary day, Feingold, who had polled in the single digits during much of the campaign, won 70% of the vote. Seven weeks later, while Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Ross Perot split the Wisconsin presidential vote 41%-37%-21%, Feingold beat Kasten, 53% to 46%.|$|E
25|$|When he debuted, he sang {{old school}} pop and {{acoustic}} R ballads. Starting from Revolution (公轉自轉), Wang began to test out R pop music, but quickly jumped to <b>a</b> <b>quirky</b> style of dance-pop for Impossible to Miss You (不可能錯過你). Starting from Forever's First Day (永遠的第一天), he began composing rock songs with heavy electric guitar melodies and {{less emphasis on}} dance-pop. Nonetheless, he still concentrated in light R music. The One and Only (唯一) became his only fully produced rock album.|$|E

5000|$|... “...one of {{the five}} best films {{in the world for}} 2008. It’s just as good on second viewing. ...<b>a</b> meandering, <b>quirky</b> and {{surprisingly}} beautiful piece of work that perfectly balances humour and emotion.” ...|$|R

25|$|By October 2000, {{the number}} of bras had reached around 200, and again the fence was cleared of bras. This time the story spread even wider, as the fence had become to some <b>a</b> <b>quirky</b> tourist attraction, and media sources from as far afield as Europe became {{interested}} in the fence. Due to this interest, {{the number of}} bras being added to the fence personally, or sent to be added, increased dramatically. In early 2006, the number of bras attached to the fence stood at close to 800.|$|E
25|$|During {{a tour of}} the Netherlands in December 1973, Geoff Leigh {{left the}} group. Looking for more unusual {{instruments}} to draw them further away from standard rock and jazz, Henry Cow asked classically trained Lindsay Cooper (oboe, bassoon) to join. With hardly any time to rehearse, and Cooper having just had all four wisdom teeth extracted, they returned to The Manor in early 1974 to begin recording Unrest. It was during this time that they became acquainted with Slapp Happy, <b>a</b> <b>quirky</b> avant-pop trio of Peter Blegvad (guitar), Anthony Moore (keyboards) and Dagmar Krause (vocals), who had just completed their first LP for Virgin.|$|E
25|$|As {{governor}} Pennoyer quickly made a {{name for}} himself as <b>a</b> <b>quirky</b> and cantankerous leader. In 1891 he pointedly snubbed President Benjamin Harrison when Harrison visited Oregon on a campaign tour. He refused to leave his office to meet Harrison at the state border, and when Harrison came to Salem Pennoyer kept him waiting in the train station (in the rain) and arrived 10 minutes late. That year the Oregon Legislative Assembly created the Oregon Attorney General office, and Pennoyer appointed George Earle Chamberlain to that post. While in office Pennoyer declared without authority that the Oregon Supreme Court lacked the power to invalidate legislative acts on constitutional grounds.|$|E

25|$|The Bride and the Butterfly Hunter (1974) is <b>a</b> <b>quirky,</b> surrealistic {{film version}} of a play by Nisim Aloni about a bride who flees her wedding and a clerk who flees his humdrum {{existence}} by escaping to the park every Wednesday afternoon to hunt—and release—butterflies. The encounter between the two {{takes place in a}} park, where political propaganda is broadcast over a loudspeaker system. Though this is not integral to the story, it indicates that even in the most whimsical encounters it is impossible to escape the overbearing presence of political forces exploiting the conflicts in Israel for their own advantage. This film was selected to represent Israel at the Prix Italia.|$|E

The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment. It was then that Atlanta Stadium was renamed Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium. Turner quickly gained a reputation as <b>a</b> <b>quirky,</b> hands-on baseball owner. On May 11, 1977, Turner appointed himself manager, but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the Braves lost 2–1 to the Pittsburgh Pirates to bring their losing streak to 17 games).|$|E
25|$|Betty Suarez is <b>a</b> <b>quirky,</b> 22-year-old Mexican American {{woman from}} Queens, New York who is sorely lacking in fashion sense. She {{is known for}} her adult braces, rather unusual {{wardrobe}} choices, sweet nature, and slight naïvete. She is abruptly thrust into a different world when she lands a job at Mode, a trendy, high fashion magazine based in Manhattan {{that is part of}} the publishing empire, Meade Publications, of the wealthy Bradford Meade. Bradford's son Daniel has been installed as Editor-in-Chief of Mode following the death of Fey Sommers (Bradford's longtime mistress). Bradford hires the inexperienced Betty as his womanizing son's newest personal assistant to curb his habit of sleeping with his assistants. As time goes by, Betty and Daniel become friends and help each other navigate their individual professional and personal lives.|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert gave Inserts 2.5 stars {{out of a}} {{possible}} 4, writing that the film's dialogue was stilted and the setting not entirely convincing, but that Dreyfuss and Cartwright gave effective performances and the film [...] "has <b>a</b> certain <b>quirky</b> charm." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{series was}} militaristic in nature, with each enemy sprite having a {{corresponding}} information {{section in the}} pause menu, relating details {{of the real world}} weapon (or a fictionalized version, in the case of non-existent weapons, such as the Mohican helicopter from Urban Strike). The next generation titles, Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, featured plots based heavily on present day geopolitics, such as the instability of post-USSR states, or tensions at the DMZ between North and South Korea. However, in contrast, the games often displayed <b>a</b> <b>quirky</b> sense of humor, featuring numerous appearances by Elvis including outside a castle where he cannot be killed or even harmed, he just laughs at you and even Santa Claus, as well as wisecracks from the player character in the earlier games (in Urban Strike, the player's character, on being told the villain is an evil genius, comments: 'Great, another evil genius. Why can't I ever fight an evil idiot?') Although ostensibly serious in nature, the games were often quite tongue-in-cheek in their execution.|$|E
25|$|The Sharks {{advanced}} to the Western Conference Semi-finals to face the third-seed Detroit Red Wings, whom they had defeated in five games during the previous post-season's second round. Just like the year prior, the Sharks won the first three games of the series and lost the fourth but instead of replicating the previous year's success in Game 5, the Sharks dropped two more games as the Red Wings became the eighth team in NHL history to force a Game 7 after losing the first three games of a series. However, they would not become the 4th team in history {{to pull off the}} comeback as the Sharks prevailed, 3–2, with the game-winning goal scored by former captain Patrick Marleau who had endured media criticism from former teammate and now NBC Sports Network television personality Jeremy Roenick for his lackluster play in Game 5 of the series against the Red Wings. The Sharks {{advanced to}} their third Western Conference Finals series, their first playoff meeting with the Vancouver Canucks. San Jose dropped the first two games of the series at Rogers Arena in Vancouver but rebounded with a 4–3 victory thanks to two first-period goals by Marleau in Game 3. However, they lost the fourth game of the series and eventually were eliminated from the playoffs after a Game 5 in Vancouver that featured a game-tying goal by the Canucks' Ryan Kesler with 18.3 seconds remaining in the third period as well as <b>a</b> <b>quirky</b> bounce off a side stanchion that allowed Kevin Bieksa to score the overtime goal that advanced Vancouver to their third Stanley Cup Finals and left the Sharks knocked out in Round 3 for the second consecutive post-season.|$|E
500|$|Her unique {{utility of}} the English {{language}} gives her words <b>a</b> <b>quirky,</b> idiosyncratic edge, allowing lines like “if you forget my name, you’ll go astray/ like a killer whale” to ring somehow striking. Said masterstrokes and quirks are well intact here, as {{is evident in the}} asteroid-bass volley of [...] "Mutual Core" [...] and lead single [...] "Crystalline"‘s apocalyptical breakbeat coda.|$|E
