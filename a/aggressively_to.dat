5|$|Djungarian hamsters {{are common}} as pets in Europe and North America, and exhibit greater {{variance}} in their coats than {{those found in}} the wild. They reproduce often—more so than Syrian hamsters, and as they have no fixed breeding season, can continue to produce large numbers of offspring all year round. Young pups act <b>aggressively</b> <b>to</b> one another, while breeding females may show similar aggression to males.|$|E
5|$|As {{a center}} for trade and travel between the U.S., the Caribbean, and South America, South Florida is {{especially}} vulnerable to invasive species, or species {{of plants and animals}} that adapt <b>aggressively</b> <b>to</b> conditions in the Everglades, allowing them to reproduce faster and grow larger than they would naturally in their native environments. Approximately 26% of all species of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Controlling invasive species in 1,700,000 acres (6,900km2) of infested land in South Florida costs authorities about $500 million a year.|$|E

5|$|Benaud {{returned}} for the Third Test, when England levelled the series despite twin half-centuries of 73 and 53 from Harvey, who top-scored in both innings on a dustbowl in a match that lasted only three days. Harvey {{failed to pass}} 35 {{in the last two}} Tests, and ended with 338 runs at 42.25, and was a significant factor in Australia's eventual 2–1 victory. In {{the second half of the}} tour, Harvey added centuries against Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire and took his career best bowling fugres of 4/8 against Middlesex to help set up a ten-wicket win. He ended his final tour for Australia with 1452 runs at 44.00 with five centuries. During the season, Harvey and Benaud led <b>aggressively</b> <b>to</b> force a result through attacking strategy and a determination to avoid time-wasting.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{typically}} coexist peacefully {{with other}} herbivores, which will usually {{stay out of}} their way. Some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded. At Aberdare National Park, Kenya, a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group. At Hluhluwe–Umfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa, introduced young orphan elephants went on a killing spree that {{claimed the lives of}} 36 rhinos during the 1990s, but ended with the introduction of older males. The size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators, though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers. Calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs in Africa and tigers in Asia. The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting juvenile elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller ones like leopards (which have not been recorded killing calves); the latter they react less fearfully and more <b>aggressively</b> <b>to.</b> Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to other herbivores. This is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads.|$|E

25|$|For men at risk {{of never}} finding a mate, the fitness benefit to {{engaging}} in aggressive, violent behavior could outweigh the potential costs of fightings, especially if fighting alongside a coalition.

25|$|Nelson Rockefeller was {{governor}} from 1959 to 1973 and changed New York politics.

The World Trade Center and other profligate projects nearly drove New York City into bankruptcy in 1975. The state took substantial budgetary control, which eventually led to improved fiscal prudence.|$|E

25|$|Louis XIV {{gained the}} throne in 1643 and acted {{increasingly}} <b>aggressively</b> <b>to</b> force the Huguenots to convert. At first he sent missionaries, {{backed by a}} fund to financially reward converts to Catholicism. Then he imposed penalties, closed Huguenot schools and excluded them from favoured professions. Escalating, he instituted dragonnades, which included the occupation and looting of Huguenot homes by military troops, {{in an effort to}} forcibly convert them. In 1685, he issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, revoking the Edict of Nantes and declaring Protestantism illegal.|$|E
25|$|By 1908, George Hartford Sr. divided {{management}} responsibilities {{among his}} sons, with George Jr. controlling finance with John directing sales and operations. The sons ran A for over 40 years. The younger Hartford moved <b>aggressively</b> <b>to</b> promote the A brand, dramatically increasing the product line. To make {{space for the}} new items, A replaced in-store premiums with S Green Stamps. By 1912, the corporation operated 400 stores and averaged a 22% gross margin, resulting in a 2% profit. A's peddlers were also operating 5,000 rural routes in distinctive red-and-black wagons.|$|E

They act <b>aggressively</b> <b>to</b> other females that come close to their pups, as well as alien pups that try to get milk from them. Pups first enter the water at about four weeks and are weaned at about 12 months. This is normally when the mother gives birth to a new pup.

In practice, the difficulty for a diabetic person <b>to</b> <b>aggressively</b> dose insulin <b>to</b> keep blood sugars levels close to normal {{and at the same time}} constantly adjust the insulin regimen to the dynamic demands of exercise, stress, and wellness can practically assure occasional hyperinsulinemia. The pharmacokinetic imperfections of all insulin replacement regimens is a severe limitation.|$|R

25|$|Non-contact - While paintball does involve tagging {{players with}} paintball projectiles, this is {{generally}} considered the sole point of physical contact between members of opposing teams. Players are generally prohibited from physically contacting other players, such as colliding with them, physically restraining them, and especially using fists, feet, protective gear or the markers themselves to hit other players. Fisticuffs in particular are dangerous {{not only to the}} participants but to all players on or off the field, and referees are generally trained to respond immediately and <b>aggressively</b> <b>to</b> stop the fight, and to eject and ban instigators of these fights.|$|E
25|$|For the 1992 Cricket World Cup Greatbatch was not {{selected}} {{to play in}} the first match, against Australia. However, he was {{selected to}} open against South Africa in place of John Wright, who had been injured, and proceeded to bat <b>aggressively</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of fielding restrictions early in the innings. The strategy worked, so was repeated again throughout the World Cup and Greatbatch {{became one of the first}} 'pinch hitter' players to open an innings in One Day Internationals. Because of this success other cricketing nations, notably Sri Lanka, adopted the idea of opening with an aggressive batsman who normally plays in the middle order of test matches to score quick runs early and this tactic is now common in international cricket.|$|E
25|$|FEMA, which {{requested}} the testing by the CDC, {{said it would}} work <b>aggressively</b> <b>to</b> relocate all residents of the temporary housing as soon as possible.

Engelhardt of New Orleans approved a $42.6 million class-action lawsuit settlement for the plaintiffs, who included roughly 55,000 residents of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas. The defendants included two dozen manufacturers who built mobile homes for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), including Gulf Stream Coach Inc., Forest River Inc., Vanguard LLC and Monaco Coach Corp. A separate $5.1 million settlement dealt with claims against FEMA contractors including Shaw Environmental Inc., Bechtel Corp., Fluor Enterprises Inc. and CH2M Hill Constructors Inc., who were responsible for installing and maintaining the units.|$|E
