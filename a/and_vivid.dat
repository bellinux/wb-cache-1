5|$|Olivia Mary Manning CBE (2 March 1908– 23 July 1980) was a British novelist, poet, {{writer and}} reviewer. Her fiction and non-fiction, {{frequently}} detailing journeys and personal odysseys, were principally set in England, Ireland, Europe and the Middle East. She often wrote from her personal experience, though her books also demonstrate strengths in imaginative writing. Her books are widely admired for her artistic eye <b>and</b> <b>vivid</b> descriptions of place.|$|E
5|$|As an {{illiterate}} child, she {{had been}} told Bible stories by her mother. The particular variety of her early Christian belief remains unclear, but she acquired a passionate faith in God. She rejected {{the teachings of the}} New Testament that urged slaves to be obedient and found guidance in the Old Testament tales of deliverance. Tubman was devout, and when she began experiencing visions <b>and</b> <b>vivid</b> dreams, she interpreted them as revelations from God. This religious perspective informed her actions throughout her life.|$|E

40|$|Rene Descartes {{gives an}} ontological {{argument}} {{for the existence of}} God in his “Fifth Meditation. ” He claims to have a <b>vivid</b> <b>and</b> clear idea of God, <b>and</b> a <b>vivid</b> <b>and</b> clear idea of God having the property of perfection. Perfection entails the property of existence, because in order for something to be perfect, it has to actually exist. Therefore, God has the property of existence, that is, God exists. Descartes’ argument relies on his <b>vivid</b> <b>and</b> clear perceptions. Earlier in his Meditations, he argued that a <b>vivid</b> <b>and</b> clear perception is unquestionable, or self-evident. I argue that Descartes’ ontological {{argument for the}} existence of God does not prove the existence of God because Descartes could not have vividly and clearly perceived God to have the property of perfection. Given that a <b>vivid</b> <b>and</b> clear perception is unquestionable, if I prove that God’s property of perfection is questionable, Descartes’ ontological argument falls apart. The goal of my paper is to show that God’s property of perfection is inseparable from God’s property of infinity, God’s property of infinity is questionable, and thus God’s property of perfection is questionable. Since God’s property of perfection is questionable, it could not have been provided by a <b>vivid</b> <b>and</b> clear perception...|$|R

Early in life, she {{suffered}} a traumatic head wound when an irate slave owner threw a heavy metal weight intending to hit another slave and hit her instead. The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of hypersomnia, which occurred throughout her life. She was a devout Christian and experienced strange visions <b>and</b> <b>vivid</b> dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{returned}} to creating fictional nations as allusions to real countries in subsequent Adventures, such as Syldavia and Borduria (based largely on Yugoslavia and Nazi Germany) in King Ottokar's Sceptre and Sondonesia (based on Indonesia) in Flight 714 to Sydney. He also re-used other elements pioneered in The Broken Ear {{in his later}} Adventures: a parrot in The Castafiore Emerald, a ravine crash in The Calculus Affair, a fireball <b>and</b> <b>vivid</b> dream in The Seven Crystal Balls, and a firing squad in Tintin and the Picaros. Tintin {{returned to}} San Theodores in Tintin and the Picaros, in which the characters Pablo and Ridgewell also made a reappearance.|$|E
5|$|Sir Hugh Seymour Walpole, CBE (13 March 18841 June 1941) was an English novelist. He {{was the son}} of an Anglican clergyman, {{intended}} for a career in the church but drawn instead to writing. Among those who encouraged him were the authors Henry James and Arnold Bennett. His skill at scene-setting <b>and</b> <b>vivid</b> plots, as well as his high profile as a lecturer, brought him a large readership in the United Kingdom and North America. He was a best-selling author in the 1920s and 1930s but has been largely neglected since his death.|$|E

5|$|Architecture {{during the}} Song period reached new heights of sophistication. Authors such as Yu Hao and Shen Kuo wrote books {{outlining}} {{the field of}} architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and structural engineering in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting struts built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing. Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and units of measurement for various building types. The architect Li Jie (1065–1110), who published the Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire. He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for mortar formulas in masonry. In his book, Li provided detailed <b>and</b> <b>vivid</b> illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings. These illustrations displayed various applications of corbel brackets, cantilever arms, mortise and tenon work of tie beams and cross beams, and diagrams showing the various building types of halls in graded sizes. He also outlined the standard units of measurement and standard dimensional measurements of all building components described and illustrated in his book.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 17th century, {{the play was}} famous for its ghost <b>and</b> <b>vivid</b> dramatisation of melancholy and insanity, leading to a {{procession}} of mad courtiers and ladies in Jacobean and Caroline drama. Though it remained popular with mass audiences, late 17th-century Restoration critics saw Hamlet as primitive and disapproved of its lack of unity and decorum. This view changed drastically in the 18th century, when critics regarded Hamlet as a hero—a pure, brilliant young man thrust into unfortunate circumstances. By the mid-18th century, however, the advent of Gothic literature brought psychological and mystical readings, returning madness and the ghost to the forefront. Not until the late 18th century did critics and performers begin to view Hamlet as confusing and inconsistent. Before then, he was either mad, or not; either a hero, or not; with no in-betweens. These developments represented {{a fundamental change in}} literary criticism, which came to focus more on character and less on plot. By the 19th century, Romantic critics valued Hamlet for its internal, individual conflict reflecting the strong contemporary emphasis on internal struggles and inner character in general. Then too, critics started to focus on Hamlet's delay as a character trait, rather than a plot device. This focus on character and internal struggle continued into the 20th century, when criticism branched in several directions, discussed in context and interpretation below.|$|E

25|$|In narcolepsy, {{the order}} and length of NREM and REM sleep periods are disturbed, with REM sleep {{occurring}} at sleep onset instead of {{after a period of}} NREM sleep. Also, some aspects of REM sleep that normally occur only during sleep, like lack of muscular control, sleep paralysis, <b>and</b> <b>vivid</b> dreams, occur at other times in people with narcolepsy. For example, the lack of muscular control can occur during wakefulness in a cataplexy episode; it is said that there is intrusion of REM atonia during wakefulness. Sleep paralysis <b>and</b> <b>vivid</b> dreams can occur while falling asleep or waking up. Simply put, the brain does not pass through the normal stages of dozing and deep sleep but goes directly into (and out of) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.|$|E
