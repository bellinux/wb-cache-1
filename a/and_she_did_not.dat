The 2008 Olympics was Koussihouedes second Olympics after competing in 2004, and she was selected to compete in heat one. Koussihouede finished second in her heat {{in a time of}} 37.09seconds, behind Sameera Al-Bitar and ahead of Pamela Girimbabazi Rugabira and Djene Barry.

5|$|Dresden was {{commissioned}} into service with the High Seas Fleet eight {{months before the}} end of World War I; as a result, her service career was limited <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> see action. She participated in a fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys to Scandinavia, but they failed to locate any convoys and returned to port. Dresden was to have participated in a climactic sortie {{in the final days of}} the war, but a revolt in the fleet forced Admirals Reinhard Scheer and Franz von Hipper to cancel the operation. The ship was interned in Scapa Flow after the end of the war and scuttled with the fleet there on 21 June 1919, under orders from the fleet commander Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter.|$|E

5|$|For 2011, Robson hired a new coach, Frenchman Patrick Mouratoglou, {{and moved}} her working base to Paris. Her season was {{disrupted}} by injury at the Hopman Cup <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{compete in a}} tournament until March 2011; her comeback was then delayed for a further month by an injury in her second competition. Returning again {{at the end of}} April 2011, Robson's best performance to date came at the $50,000 tournament at Indian Harbor Beach, Florida, where she reached the semifinal. Robson split from Mouratoglou just before Wimbledon. Robson then won her first match at a Grand Slam as she defeated Angelique Kerber, but lost to Maria Sharapova in the second round.|$|E
5|$|HMS Ledbury was {{an escort}} {{destroyer}} of the Hunt class Type II. The Royal Navy ordered Ledburys construction {{two days after}} the outbreak of the Second World War and J. I. Thornycroft Ltd laid down her keel at their Southampton yard on 24 January 1940. Air raid damage to the yard delayed her construction <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> launch until 27 September 1941. Her initial assignment was to perform escort duties between Scapa Flow and Iceland. She remained in this theatre for {{the first part of the}} war, during which time she served with the ill-fated Arctic convoy PQ 17 in June 1942, from which twenty-four ships were lost.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Fatima Jinnah {{joined her}} brother in England. From then on, Muhammad Jinnah would receive {{personal}} care {{and support from}} her as he aged and began to suffer from the lung ailments which would kill him. She lived and travelled with him, and became a close advisor. Muhammad Jinnah's daughter, Dina, was educated in England and India. Jinnah later became estranged from Dina after she decided to marry a Christian, Neville Wadia from a prominent Parsi business family. When Jinnah urged Dina to marry a Muslim, she reminded {{him that he had}} married a woman not raised in his faith. Jinnah continued to correspond cordially with his daughter, but their personal relationship was strained, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> come to Pakistan in his lifetime, but only for his funeral.|$|E
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> call herself Signora Ballatino, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> play {{upon the}} zithern. Her name has a homelier sound, and her {{speciality}} is the delineation of coster character.|$|R

5|$|Ships of the Royal Australian Navy also {{assisted}} the Royal Navy in the blockade of the German High Seas Fleet. In February 1915, HMAS Australia joined the British Grand Fleet, and was made flagship of the 2nd Battle Cruiser Squadron. Australia {{was not involved}} in the Battle of Jutland; in April, the battlecruiser was damaged in a collision with sister ship , <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> return to service until June. Three RAN ships were present during the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet; Australia, Sydney, and Melbourne, with Australia leading the port division of the Grand Fleet as it sailed out to meet the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Captain S. H. Carlill assumed command on 24 June and the Illustrious resumed deck-landing training. On 8 and 9 November the Supermarine 510 {{research}} aircraft {{made the}} first ever landings by a swept-wing aircraft aboard a carrier. This aircraft {{was one of the}} ancestors of the Supermarine Swift fighter. A month later the ship began a four-month refit and hosted the first carrier landing of the de Havilland Sea Venom on 9 July 1951. Later in the month she hosted the Sea Furies of 802 and the Fireflies of 814 Squadrons for Exercise Winged Fleet. Captain C. T. Jellicoe relieved Carlill on 27 August and the ship ferried 10 Fireflies of 814 Squadron to Malta beginning on 1 October. She exchanged them for Firebrands for the return voyage. On 3 November she began loading the 39th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom) of the 3rd Infantry Division in response to the riots in Cyprus that broke out when Egypt abrogated the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936. She set sail two days later and arrived at Famagusta on 11 November. She returned to Portsmouth on 19 November and began loading the 45th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards, and the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment two days later. Illustrious set sail on 23 November and reached Famagusta on 29 November. She returned to Portsmouth on 7 December <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> leave harbour until 30 January 1952 when she resumed her customary role as a training ship.|$|E

25|$|Since {{consent was}} impossible, given her {{powerless}} position, David in essence raped her. Rape means {{to have sex}} against the will, without the consent, of another – <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{have the power to}} consent. Even if there was no physical struggle, even if she gave in to him, it was rape.|$|E
25|$|She briefly dated Gregory Lekhtman, the {{inventor}} of Exerlopers, during her term as prime minister, but the relationship was relatively private <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> involve him in the 1993 election campaign. She is currently married to Hershey Felder, an actor, playwright, composer, and concert pianist. She remains close to Nathan Divinsky's daughter Pamelea.|$|E
25|$|She won the Carlsbad 5000 the {{following}} March. Steely was the 1993 USA Outdoor runner-up in the 3,000 meters but was replaced {{in the national}} team for the 1993 World Championships in Athletics.

50|$|Adriana asks Rogelio {{to return}} to Mexico City, because things have changed <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> need his {{services}} anymore. But Rogelio refuses. Rogelio begins to act cynical in his role of Adrian {{to put pressure on}} Adriana.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 Lee {{refused to}} sign a {{petition}} to help ban import of highly endangered Atlantic bluefin tuna to Hong Kong, saying that her daughter loves sashimi <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> want her daughter to get mad at her.|$|R
25|$|After {{living in}} Württemberg for so long, {{she was at}} odds {{politically}} and religiously with her Russian relatives. Her political sympathies lay with Germany <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> share the increasingly anti-German view of the Romanovs. Vera Konstantinovna was very religious, but had never understood the Orthodox faith and eventually abandoned it to convert to Lutheranism in 1909, {{to the consternation of}} the Romanov family. She then commissioned the building of a Protestant church on the grounds of Villa Berg.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Barron ran for {{the city}} council. He {{attacked}} the incumbent, East New York councilmember Priscilla Wooten, for supporting Mayor Rudy Giuliani, saying her politics were out of date <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> take enough initiative for neighborhood and community development. Barron was endorsed by black leaders David Dinkins and Al Sharpton, but he ended up losing to Wooten. Barron ran again in 2001, when term limits prevented Wooten from running. He defeated her son, Donald Wooten, and became City Councillor for the 42nd District. Barron was re-elected in 2005 and 2009, each time with over 85% of the popular vote.|$|E
25|$|Campbell was {{the only}} Canadian prime {{minister}} not to have resided at 24 Sussex Drive since that address became the official home of the Prime Minister of Canada in 1951. Campbell's predecessor Mulroney remained at 24 Sussex while renovations on his new home in Montreal were being completed. Campbell instead took up residence at Harrington Lake, the PM's summer and weekend retreat, located in rural Quebec, north of Ottawa, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> move into 24 Sussex after Mulroney left. Like Charles Tupper and John Turner, Campbell never sat in Parliament as Prime Minister, as her term was filled by the summer break and the election campaign.|$|E

25|$|News of the {{controversial}} incident rapidly spread throughout the town of Oberlin, whose populace did not generally hold the same progressive views purported by the college, and through Ohio. While she was walking home alone one night, she was dragged into an open field by unknown assailants, badly beaten, and left for dead. After the attack, local authorities arrested Lewis, charging her with poisoning her friends. John Mercer Langston, an Oberlin College alumnus, and the only practicing African-American lawyer in Oberlin, represented Lewis during her trial. Although most witnesses spoke against her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> testify, the jury acquitted her of the charges.|$|E
25|$|The {{document}} {{exhibited by}} Rivera {{to prove his}} status as a Catholic priest was fraudulent. The Catholic Church denies his claim of having been a Jesuit priest, or another claim that he was a bishop. He had only one sister in London. She was not a nun, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> live in a convent so the claim that his sister the nun nearly died in a convent in London is certainly problematic. In an employment form dated 1963, Rivera stated he was married to Carmen Lydia Torres, and the couple had two children in the U.S. In his narrative, Rivera also claimed that he was a priest living in Spain in 1963.|$|E
25|$|HMS Ardent {{was ordered}} on 6 March 1928 from the yards of Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Greenock, Scotland under the 1927 Naval Estimates.

After carrying out acceptance trials throughout March 1930, she was assigned on 23 March to operate with the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, with the Mediterranean Fleet. Whilst working up, her No. 4 gun mounting {{was found to be}} defective and Ardent returned to Chatham for a replacement. The repairs were not completed until May, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> sail for her new station at Malta until 19 May.|$|E
