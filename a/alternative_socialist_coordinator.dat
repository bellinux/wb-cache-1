5000|$|After {{approximately}} {{a year of}} leadership discussions, joint forums and participation by Socialist Alliance at <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative's</b> Marxism conference, the <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> leadership publicly announced that they were pulling out unity discussions in November 2013, but remained open to ongoing collaboration. <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> claimed the <b>Socialist</b> Alliance's approach to a Transitional Program and electoral politics was [...] "not sufficiently similar to carry through a sustained and productive unity." ...|$|R
50|$|The Trotskyist organisation, the Socialist Party, {{which won}} 3 seats in Dáil Eireann in the 2016 General Elections, {{supports}} breaking the EU's rules {{and supported the}} Brexit result. It argues that the European Union is institutionally capitalist and neoliberal. The Socialist Party campaigned against the Lisbon and Nice Treaties and favours the foundation of an <b>alternative</b> <b>Socialist</b> European Union.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> {{was invited}} to join the Socialist Alliance in 2001. The Alliance grouped {{together}} the Democratic Socialist Perspective (DSP), the ISO, and other Australian far-left groups and individuals. <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> eventually declined to join due to the Socialist Alliance's strong emphasis on running in parliamentary elections. This parliamentary emphasis in the flat political climate was seen by <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> as a restriction to building activism on the ground and representing a turn towards reformist politics. <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> entered into unity discussions with the Revolutionary Socialist Party (a split from the DSP) in 2012 [...] "on the basis of a straightforward revolutionary Marxist program... for socialism in Australia today", which prompted the Socialist Alliance to reopen unity discussions with <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative.</b>|$|R

50|$|Yuri Mamin {{began his}} {{directing}} career under the communist regime. He {{was never a}} communist and was always opposed to the oppressive power of the Communist Party. Because of this, he could not create his films {{until the beginning of}} Perestroika in 1985 and Mikhail Gorbachev's arrival to power. His works are popular among <b>alternative</b> <b>socialist</b> groups who criticize both capitalism and the Soviet system.|$|R
50|$|<b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> {{has over}} the years tried to {{establish}} unity talks with both Solidarity and its predecessor organisation, the International Socialist Organisation, (the group from which <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative's</b> founders were expelled) yet have remained unsuccessful. This could be in part to do with <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative's</b> perspective of currently identifying as a propaganda group, which has been controversial within the Australian far left in general.|$|R
50|$|<b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> {{is heavily}} {{involved}} with supporting {{the activities of}} the August 80 trade union, including defending victimised trade unionists and arguing for better working conditions. <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> has also participated in other actions defending trade unionists in the Committee for the Aid and Defence of Victimised Workers (KPiORP). In addition, <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> has been involved in helping to build the small Polish Labour Party.|$|R
25|$|An <b>alternative</b> <b>socialist</b> {{establishment}} existed alongside, the Petrograd Soviet, wielding {{power through}} the democratically elected councils {{of workers and}} peasants, called Soviets. The rule of the new authorities only aggravated {{the crisis in the}} country, instead of resolving it. Eventually, the October Revolution, led by Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Provisional Government and gave full governing power to the Soviets, leading {{to the creation of the}} world's first socialist state.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> was deregistered as a club at Monash University in September 2014. Matthew Lesh, Political Affairs Director of the Australasian_Union_of_Jewish Students, {{claimed that}} members of the {{organisation}} refused entry to a group of Jewish students {{on the basis of their}} religion and assumed political beliefs. [...] The <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> denied this claim. <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> is threatened with no longer receiving funds from the university and not being able to book university venues.|$|R

50|$|LEARN was {{established}} in October 1986, about {{eight months after the}} People Power Revolution. Its founders were leaders of different trade unions outside the then mainstream labor organizations and major political or ideological blocs. They called for genuine workers' empowerment by developing an alternative workers' education that blends the economic, political and socio-cultural struggles of the workers; propagates an <b>alternative</b> <b>socialist</b> system; and is guided by the basic principles of trade union solidarity, democracy, self-reliance and autonomy.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> {{have argued}} that rival socialist organisations (particularly on the Australian far-left) - such as the Socialist Alliance, the former DSP and the RSP - who promote the idea that such states {{represent}} some form of socialism (or what the IST and <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> term [...] "socialism from above") are Stalinist in nature. <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> does not however preclude individuals who subscribe to such theories from joining their organisation. <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> sees the October 1917 Bolshevik revolution in Russia as a genuine socialist revolution but assert the following [...] "imperialist" [...] attack on {{the country and the}} failure of the revolution to spread to Western Europe lead to its ultimate defeat by Stalin's [...] "counter-revolution".|$|R
50|$|In September 2012 the Socialist Alliance {{initiated}} unity {{discussions with}} <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative,</b> the other main {{group on the}} Australian far-left.

50|$|<b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> (Sosialistinen Vaihtoehto) is the Finnish {{section of}} the Committee for a Workers' International. Founded in 2002, it is active in Helsinki, Turku and Oulu. The name in English is <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> {{the same as the}} CWI section in America which has {{attracted}} some attention in Finland.|$|R
50|$|Students {{and student}} union activists form a large {{composition}} of <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative's</b> membership {{and their political}} work often emphasises university-based campaigns. According to National Executive member Mick Armstrong, <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative's</b> focus on student work {{is part of a}} perspective that the organisation has adopted for the political period, due to what they see as their limited size and influence in the working class movement and the lack of any substantial radicalisation in society. <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative's</b> political orientation to students mirrors the development of the British Socialist Workers Party during the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the capture}} of Samara by the Czech Legion on 8 June, {{several members of the}} Constituent Assembly, which had been {{dissolved}} by the Bolsheviks, organized a Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly (in Russian [...] "Constituent Assembly" [...] was [...] "Uchreditel'noe Sobranie", hence the abbreviation for Committee was [...] "Komuch"). This threatened to form an <b>alternative</b> <b>socialist</b> government to the Bolshevik regime.In August 1918, the Whites occupied Kazan. Bolshevik forces were defeated, and they dispersed to Kazan's neighborhood. The Whites shot the rest of Bolsheviks in the city.|$|R

50|$|Since the Howard {{government}} {{introduced legislation}} in 2004 to ban same-sex marriage in Australia, <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> {{has participated in}} the Equal Love campaign - the main campaign group that advocates marriage equality in the country. Many <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> members have been elected as National Union of Students Queer Officers and have used this position to promote Equal Love and attack the Rudd-Gillard Government for not repealing the ban. <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> claim they play a key rôle in holding the campaign together, {{which resulted in the}} largest demonstration of its kind in Australia outside the 2011 ALP National Conference. <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> member and Victorian Equal Love Convenor Ali Hogg, was voted the most influential LGBTI Australian by Samesame.com.au and the sixth most influential Melburnian by The Age for her activism in gay and lesbian rights in 2011.|$|R
40|$|It {{must seem}} {{to many people}} that the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union (and the planned economies of Eastern Europe) effectively ends the socialist calculation debate, with a decisive verdict in favour of the market. We argue that this conclusion is unwarranted. Soviet socialism presented a specific form of planning with definite shortcomings of its own, and its collapse need not rule out <b>alternative</b> <b>socialist</b> planning mechanisms. We point out some of the particular limitations of the Soviet model, and offer some justification for the view that there exist alternative planning methods that are both technically feasible and potentially efficient and fair...|$|R
50|$|<b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> are {{hostile to}} other far-left tendencies who look to forces outside the working class, such as anarchism and Castroism, which they characterise as substitutionist, elitist and ultimately, siding with reaction. <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> also believe {{identity}} politics - such as liberal feminism and black nationalism - present a false unity {{between members of}} oppressed groups across class lines by positing that all members of an oppressed group hold a common interest in fighting oppression. In {{the case of the}} latter as an example, <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> believe women's oppression can only disappear with the abolition of all classes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> host {{an annual}} far-left {{political}} conference in Melbourne each year called Marxism, which {{has grown to}} attract over 1000 attendees - which has featured international guest speakers such as John Pilger and Malalai Joya - becoming the largest conference {{of its kind in}} Australia. <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> also host regular political meetings and events and produce political commentary and analysis through their own various publications and through other publishers in which the organisation puts forward their positions on Australian and international issues. In 2013, <b>Socialist</b> <b>Alternative</b> started distribution of a fortnightly newspaper and website titled Red Flag.|$|R
