Stephen Glover from the Daily Mail wrote that Ruth [...] "was the least likely candidate in the village to join the ranks of Ambridge inhabitants who over the years have relished <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side." [...] Glover's colleague Nigel Andrew was not a fan of the adultery storyline and wanted the old Ruth back, saying she had [...] "been replaced by Ruth Mark 2, a helpless overgrown teenager, reduced to a puddle of lust by amorous cowman Sam." [...] Rachel Cooke of the New Statesman was not a fan of the character at all, writing [...] "Ruth bores me to sobs, so I didn't give a fig that this was out of character." [...] Lezard noted that Ruth had gone from [...] "cheery supermum-farmer to lovelorn hysteric facing total loss".|$|E
500|$|For the PC version, GameSpot editor Stephen Poole stated [...] "You'll {{be better}} off looking for free online {{versions}} of the various games contained in Caesars Palace 2000". In contrast, IGN was more favorable to the PC version of the game. Francois Laramee of Allgame praised the game for its [...] "excellent audio-visuals. The 3D accelerated graphics, specifically the tables, the cards and the dealers' hands, are well modeled and lit, and the playing chips are beautiful. The sound effects are accurate, and the voice actors, competent". However, he noted that [...] "some of the 3D effects are not particularly wieldy, the menus flicker, it's often hard to stop the scrolling menus at the right time, and the camera angles switch too fast and frequently {{to be anything but}} distracting. The slot machine wheels are <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> small side and difficult to read". Laramee went on to call the game [...] "a competent effort, but is essentially dry and uninspired". ComputerAndVideoGames.com's Alex Huhtala criticized the game for its [...] "Poor, vomit-inducing presentation".|$|E

500|$|... "I Was Here" [...] {{garnered}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics, {{most of whom}} felt the song's message was too deep for an artist like Beyoncé to sing, and criticized its placement on the track list of 4. Georgette Cline of The Boombox gave the song a positive review stating that, although the lyrics are <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> morbid side, it works in Beyoncé's favor, [...] "proving she can tackle a myriad of subjects". Matthew Horton of BBC criticized the song's order of placement on the track list of 4, stating that [...] "'Run the World (Girls)' is tagged on like a bonus track following 'I Was Here', which sounds like the perfect ending for the album." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also had the same view, saying it [...] "disrupts the flow of up-tempo songs on the second half 4". Perpetua however calls it a [...] "showstopper" [...] and added that it [...] "work well as a bittersweet emotional climax for the album". Perpetua finished his review by saying that [...] "'I Was Here' is the blustery ballad one would expect by a Beyoncé/Warren team-up, and stands off as flat and generic {{when compared to the}} rest of 4." [...] Another reviewer of the same magazine, Jody Rosen complimented Beyoncé's vocals stating that she sings with authority; however, he coined [...] "I Was Here" [...] as a low point on the album and added that it is [...] "swamped in 'My Way'-style self-mythologizing." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics who praised Cole's sense of fashion but cited that the video was unoriginal. Elena Gorgan of Softpedia said [...] "even with all this, she hardly manages {{to create a}} strong impression [...]., the video fails to break any visual ground, albeit standing on its own as a stylish video." [...] The Daily Mail agreed saying [...] " [...] which {{will no doubt be}} interpreted by fans as an insight into Cheryl's marriage to footballer Ashley Cole. Cheryl has ditched her street dance gear for a gown fit for a diva along with suitably styled big hair ... But as she teams up with Black Eyed Peas rapper will.i.am is sporting a more feminine look. The net result is, sorry to say it, very regal but <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dull side." [...] Lisa McGarry of 'Unreality TV' [...] said the platinum wig was [...] "strange" [...] She also said [...] "if it doesn’t look great, at least it looks shocking." [...] Meanwhile, David Balls of 'Digital Spy' said [...] " [...] this glitzy split-screen affair, Cheryl looks effortlessly classy and glam as she transforms into an Egyptian goddess and - with more success than a certain Mrs. B (Mel B) back in 2001 [...] - shows how to wear a blonde wig without looking like you're on a dirty weekend in the Toon. Perfectly complimenting the song itself, this super-glossy clip also suggests that Cole has a firm eye on global stardom over the next year."
