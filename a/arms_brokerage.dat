40|$|A complex {{network of}} dealers, brokers, financiers, and traffickers {{continue}} to funnel {{large quantities of}} small arms and ammunition into African conflict-zones {{despite the presence of}} United Nations arms embargoes. Weapons are often transported from arms producing countries in Eastern Europe and the post-Soviet States to remote locations in Africa by civil aircraft. This thesis will focus on the process by which weapons are bought and sold and the illicit nexus of <b>arms</b> <b>brokerage</b> and transportation networks that facilitate the deadly trade. This supply chain will be presented as the "anatomy of an arms deal" which can be further described using the statistical tools and measures of social network analysis. Selected case studies of proliferation events into the West African state of Liberia will be used to construct networks that can be compared to the supply chain model and possibly suggest additional points of intervention to halt this deadly trade.

5000|$|The 1962 {{election}} cemented {{the ascendancy}} of [...] "Witt" [...] Stephens, Faubus' primary financial backer, as the state's undisputed kingmaker. Stephens' banks held the lion's share of state funds. His Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company charged Arkansas homeowners (whom Stephens contemptuously referred to as [...] "the biscuit cookers") the highest residential rates by volume in the Southwest, thanks to Faubus' complaisant Public Service Commission—an advantage that continues today.

40|$|The finance {{literature}} suggests that analysts’ stock recommendations have negligible impact on market prices. Some studies suggest this lack of market impact may be partly driven by the affiliations between investment banks and the firms their <b>brokerage</b> <b>arms</b> cover (conflicts of interest). However, most of these studies fail {{to take into account}} other factors including institutional and trading issues and psychological biases which may well be just as important in influencing analysts when they gather, process and interpret information about stocks. The aim of the current study is to establish the factors which are associated with analysts issuing stock recommendations that lack market impact. I find that nonconforming analysts’ stock recommendations are associated with overconfidence bias (as measured by optimism in the language they use) and representativeness bias (as measured by previous stock price performance, market capitalisation, book-to-market and change in target price). Thus, stocks that receive a buy rating and subsequently underperform the respective benchmark are associated {{with a high level of}} optimism in the tone of the language used by analysts in their investment reports that they prepare to justify their recommendations, have positive previous price momentum, have large market capitalisation, have low book-to-market ratio and have their target prices changed in the same direction as the stock recommendation. Not surprisingly, there is also a relationship between the investment bank issuing the recommendation and the firm. In addition, stocks that are awarded sell rating and subsequently outperform the benchmark have characteristics opposite to those of nonconforming buys. Finding that potential conflicts of interest significantly predict analysts’ nonconforming stock recommendations supports recent policy-makers’ and investors’ allegations that analysts’ recommendations are driven by the incentives they derive from investment banking deals. These allegations have led to implementation of rules governing analysts’ and brokerage houses’ behaviours. However, finding that cognitive biases play a major role in the type of recommendation issued suggests that these rules may work only in as far as regulating conflicts of interest, but will have a limited role in regulating psychological bias, as my results suggest that analyst bias is inherent in their work. Surveys of what fund managers expect of analysts indicate low rankings of analysts’ investment advice as manifested in their recommendations (e. g., All-America Research Team Survey 2002). My results further indicate that fund manager concern is likely to continue because not all behavioural factors in analyst stock recommendations can be controlled.

40|$|Civil war creates {{significant}} {{opportunities for}} the contestation of political authority. In Sub-Saharan Africa, rebels commonly use organized violence to challenge the authority of pre-conflict elites. Nonetheless, armed movements also ally with pre-conflict elite actors as a strategy for mobilizing popular support and maintaining political order. Contestation and cooperation between rebels and pre-conflict elites is possible because local communities are often comprised of multiple elite groups. What explains coalitional choices? Why do local leaders of armed movements ally with certain actors and not others? These questions are puzzling because local-level rebel leaders sometimes make counterintuitive coalitional choices that restrict their ability {{to establish and maintain}} social control. To explore the relationship between coalition-building and control, this study focuses on the political crisis and war-to-peace transition in Côte d’Ivoire (2002 - 2013). It compares three towns – Bouna, Korhogo and Ouangolodougou – that fell under the military control of the principal armed movement involved in the conflict, the Forces Nouvelles (FN). Despite being {{under the control of the}} same group, each of these cases demonstrated marked variation in the ability of the FN to politically control local populations. My argument is advanced in two steps. First, what explains patterns of coalition-building in rebel-held zones? I argue that coalition-building is shaped by pre-conflict brokerage relations. Brokers are those political actors that link local communities to the state. I argue that if elites function as brokers between local communities and the central state in the pre-conflict period, this limits their availability as potential allies for leaders of <b>armed</b> movements. Pre-conflict <b>brokerage</b> relations constrain the choice of potential local partners. Second and relatedly, this study explains levels of control established by armed movements that result from coalition-building. The wartime authority of armed movements can, in some cases, be met with stiff resistance from local actors. In others, the wartime political order imposed by armed movements is underwritten by broad support within local communities. I explain these differences by focusing on what I call ‘hierarchical configurations’. Hierarchical configurations describe the relative levels of social hierarchy of competing elite groups. I argue that the level of wartime control established by armed movements is a function of variation in hierarchical configurations because these differences influence the political clout of rebel allies relative to their broker counterparts (or those elites aligned with the state). In summary, pre-conflict brokerage relations influence the coalition-building strategies of armed groups. These coalition-building strategies shape levels of contestation and rebel control as a result of variation in local-level hierarchical configurations...|$|R
