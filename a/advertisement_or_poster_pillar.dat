50|$|The game {{takes place}} in an {{alternate}} version of history that sees the 1940s' and 1950s' aesthetics, design and technology advance in the directions imagined at the time. The resulting universe is thus a retro-futuristic one, where the technology has evolved enough to produce laser weapons, manipulate genes and create nearly-autonomous artificial intelligence, but all {{within the confines of}} 1950s' solutions like the widespread use of atomic power and vacuum tubes, as well as having the integrated circuitry of the digital age. The architecture, advertisements and general living styles are also depicted to be largely unchanged since the 1950s, while including contemporary products, such as a robotic rocking horse for children in one <b>advertisement,</b> <b>or</b> <b>posters</b> for the underground vaults that {{play a central role in}} the storyline of the game.|$|R
40|$|In this {{increasingly}} interconnected world, it {{is second}} nature {{for people to}} communicate, socialise and share information through {{a huge number of}} media platforms, often simultaneously. Technology to support this is constantly progressing, with new mechanisms emerging all the time. People are quick to adopt the newest communication mechanisms such as instant messaging services, social networking platforms such as Facebook and photo sharing sites such as Flickr. As new technologies emerge, they bring with them new risks to users’ privacy and security. Technical security vulnerabilities are often patched incrementally until a stable and relatively secure platform is attained. However, research suggests that human factors are potentially the biggest weakness in an otherwise well-secured system. Users are unpredictable, fallible and more importantly can be misled or persuaded. A rapidly growing social interaction technology is the use of Quick Response (QR) codes as physical shortcuts to Internet resources. QR codes are matrix barcodes that are traditionally used to identify automotive components. QR codes are touted for their ease of use and convenience and are increasingly being used for marketing and social interaction. This is commonly done by placing a QR code on an <b>advertisement</b> <b>or</b> <b>poster,</b> which when scanned by a person with their mobile phone, directs them to a website...|$|R
5000|$|Domestic {{trafficking}} occurs {{particularly in}} districts {{located in the}} Andes or the Amazon jungle, to bring underage girls into cities or mining areas to work as prostitutes. Victims are recruited by friends or acquaintances and through newspaper and Internet <b>advertisements</b> <b>or</b> street <b>posters</b> offering employment; some victims are recruited by local employment agencies that offer poor young women from rural areas relatively well-paid [...] "restaurant work" [...] in Lima, Cusco, major coastal cities, and abroad. [...] The principal victims and groups {{at high risk for}} trafficking are children and young women from rural or poor urban areas, persons living in poverty, persons with disabilities, victims of domestic abuse, illiterate persons, and persons lacking birth certificates or other identification documents.|$|R
50|$|For us, {{accustomed}} {{as we are}} to a vast mass of books, {{newspapers and}} other printed or digital documents, {{it is difficult to}} realise the extensive use and great convenience assigned to inscriptions in ancient times. Not only were public announcements of all sorts, such as we should make known by <b>advertisements</b> <b>or</b> <b>posters,</b> thus placed before the public, but all kinds of records and enactments — codes of law and political decrees; regulations for all matters, civil and religious; accounts and contracts, public and private; treaties between states; records of public and private benefactions and dedications, and all matters of administration; honours to the living and to the memory of the dead. Many of these were intended to preserve for all time the records which they contained; but others must have been of only temporary interest. It seems, therefore, the more remarkable that they should have been incised on permanent material such as bronze, marble or stone — and incised in the first instance, with a care and perfection of technique which have led to their survival to the present day, so as to preserve for us invaluable evidence as to the life and institutions of the people who made them. Temporary and permanent value are therefore often combined in the same inscription. For instance, any Athenian citizen, visiting the Acropolis or the Agora, could satisfy themselves at first hand as to treaties or decrees of the people, public accounts or state income and expenditure. And at the same time these documents preserved for all time much history, both social and political.|$|R
30|$|The {{perception}} of health risk may {{not only have}} {{a major influence on}} students’ smoking-related health behavior, but also is an important consideration in health-prevention and programs. In 2014, about 68.4 % of students lacked a correct understanding of nicotine addiction (China CDC 2015). In China, approximately 31.6 % of students think quitting smoking must be difficult; however, only 18.5 % of current smokers among students think that smoking cessation is difficult (China CDC 2015). In the 2010 Global Adult Tobacco China Survey, nonsmokers had a better knowledge about the harms of smoking than smokers (Cheng et al. 2015). Improving knowledge and self-efficacy are essential strategies for reducing the high rate of smoking among teenagers, and previous study found that knowledge of tobacco cessation was significantly positively related with the implementation of tobacco cessation behavioral treatments (Muilenburg et al. 2015). About 13.0 % of students believed that smoking makes people look more attractive, and 81 % of students had never been taught about smoking or tobacco prevention at school in China (Xu et al. 2015 b). Previous studies have also proved that cognition indeed affect behavior (Parasuraman and Jiang 2012; Richardson et al. 2012), and another study among adults found that smoking-related knowledge effectively encouraged smoking cessation, which was showed on the radio, outdoor <b>advertisements</b> <b>or</b> <b>posters,</b> newspapers <b>or</b> magazines/journals, indoor LED screens, mobile TV and television (World Health Organization 2015). Therefore, to prevent smoking and reduce tobacco consumption, it’s more important {{to pay attention to the}} smoking-related knowledge and strengthen students’ awareness of smoking-related knowledge (The Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China 2012).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{last few}} years have seen the {{emergence}} of two parallel trends: the first of such trends is set by technologies such as Near Field Communication, 2 D Bar codes and RFID that support the association of digital information with virtually every object. Using these technologies ordinary objects such as coffee mugs <b>or</b> <b>advertisement</b> <b>posters</b> provide digital {{information that can be}} easily processed. The second trend is set by (semantic) Web services that provide a way to invoke automatically functionalities across the Internet lowering interoperability barriers. The PERCI system, discussed in the paper, provides a way to bridge between these two technologies allowing the invocation of Web services using the information gathered from the tags effectively transforming every object in a service proxy...|$|R

40|$|Keywords: Semiotic, {{political}} cartoon, sign, icon, symbol, index, connotation In our society, information, ideas, or opinions can {{be delivered}} through news. The existence of news {{is very important in}} spreading information through the public since many events happen everyday and bring effects to the society. Nowadays, news is not only delivered through the words but also delivered through pictures and cartoons. In this study, the writer uses political cartoon as the object. The political cartoon was analyzed by using Semiotics study. There are five political cartoons that were analyzed in this study. All of the political cartoons taken were have topic about Iran nuclear program. This study has two problems to be solved: (1) What are semiotic signs that {{can be found on the}} political cartoons of Iran nuclear program?, and (2) What are the connotations built in political cartoons of Iran nuclear program?. Based on those problems, the writer formulates the objective of this study as follows: (1) To find out the semiotics signs of political cartoons of Iran nuclear program, and (2) To identify the connotation built in political cartoons of Iran nuclear program. This study uses qualitative approach by document analysis because the study focuses on identifying sign, interpreting connotation build which found in political cartoon of Iran nuclear program. The writer collected the data by looking at the verbal and visual sign contained. This study applies typology of sign 2 ̆ 7 s theory proposed by Pierce and also Barthes connotation theory. The study reveals that iconic signs are mostly used in these political cartoons. The writer found that there were 97 signs found in total consisting of 40 icons, 27 indexes and 30 symbols. The connotation can be made by relating all the sign employed in the political cartoons. The signs can also be related to the cultural value and social convention. Each sign has a very important role to build up expected additional idea of the political cartoons. It has function to make clear, support and strengthen up a message which the cartoonist tried to convey. The writer suggests that the next researchers conduct a study on semiotics by using another form of objects, for example <b>poster,</b> comic, <b>advertisement,</b> <b>or</b> movie <b>poster.</b> The next researchers are also suggested to use some other theories to gain better understanding about semiotics...|$|R
