Shortly after, she meets her childhood friend, Prince Alexander of Greece, at a party given by Marshal Theodore Ypsilantis.

25|$|On 6 February 1889 the Bangu Textile Factory was founded, {{with the}} name of Industrial Progress Company of Brazil (Companhia Progresso Industrial do Brasil). The factory was officially opened on 8 March 1893, in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>beautiful</b> {{architectural}} complex with styles like Italianate, Neo-Gothic and a tower in Mansard Roof style. After the opening in 1893, workers from Great Britain arrived in Bangu to work in the textile factory. The old farms became worker villages with red bricks houses, and a neo-gothic church was created, which still exists as the Saint Sebastian and Saint Cecilia Parish Church. Street cinemas and cultural buildings also appeared.|$|E

25|$|The Persian carvers closely {{followed}} Arab design. A pair of {{doors of the}} 14th century from Samarkand (Victoria and Albert Museum) are typical. Boxes, spoons and other small articles were often fretted with interlacing lines of Saracenic character, the delicacy and minuteness of the work requiring the utmost patience and skill. Many of the patterns remind one, of the sandalwood work of Madras, with the difference that the Persians v~ere satisfied with a much lower relief. Sometimes <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>beautiful</b> result was obtained by the sparing tise of fretted lattice pattern among foliage. A fine panel of the 14th century in the Victoria and Albert Museum shows how active was Arab influence even as far as Bokhara.|$|E
25|$|A large legendary {{and romantic}} history {{gradually}} gathered round {{the memory of}} Fitzwalter, as the first champion of English liberty. A picturesque tale, first found in the manuscript chronicle of Dunmow, tells how Fitzwalter had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>beautiful</b> daughter named Matilda, who indignantly rejected the immoral advances of King John. At last, as the maiden proved obdurate, John caused her to be poisoned, so that the bitterest sense of personal wrong drove Fitzwalter {{to take up the}} part of a constitutional leader. So generally was the story believed that an alabaster figure on a grey altar-tomb in Priory Church, Little Dunmow is still sometimes pointed out as the effigy of the unfortunate Matilda.|$|E
25|$|The Skjöldunga saga tells that Sigurd Ring {{was married}} to Alfhild, the {{daughter}} of king Alf of Alfheim, and their son was Ragnar Lodbrok. Unfortunately, Alfhild died. When Sigurd Ring was an old man, he came to Skiringssal {{to take part in}} the great blóts. There he spotted <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>beautiful</b> girl named Alfsol, and she was the daughter of King Alf of Vendel (Vendel). The girl's two brothers refused to allow Sigurd to marry her. Sigurd fought with the brothers and killed them, but their sister had been given poison by her brothers so that Sigurd could never have her. When her corpse was carried to Sigurd, he went aboard a large ship where he placed Alvsol and her brothers. Then, he steered the ship with full sails out on the sea, as the ship burnt.|$|E

25|$|Before the 15th century preaching had {{not become}} a regular {{institution}} in England, and pulpits were not so common. However, {{the value of the}} sermon began to be appreciated from the use to which the Lollards and other sects put this method of teaching doctrine, and pulpits became a necessity. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>beautiful</b> one exists at Kenton, Devon. It is, as is generally the case, octagonal, and stands on a foot. Each angle is carved with an upright column of foliage between pinnacles, and the panels, which are painted with saints, are enriched with carved canopies and foliage; it is, however, much restored. The puipit at Trull, Somerset, is noted for its fine figure carving. A large figure standing under a canonv fills each of the nanelled sides. while many other smaller figures help to enrich the general effect. Examples of Gothic sounding boards are very rare; that, together with the pulpit, in the choir of Winchester is of the time of Prior Silkstede (1520), and is carved with his rebus, a skein of twisted silk.|$|E
25|$|Bhagavata Purana {{depicts the}} birth of the narmad. According to the text, Lord Vishnu in one of his incarnations {{appeared}} as Vaman in the sacrificial arena of Asur King Mahabali. Then in order to measure the universe, he extended his left foot {{to the end of the}} universe and pierced a hole in its covering with the nail of his big toe. Through the hole, the pure water of the Causal Ocean (Divine Brahm-Water) entered this universe as the Ganges River. Having washed the lotus feet of the Lord, which are covered with reddish saffron, the water of the Ganges acquired <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>beautiful</b> pink colour. Because the Ganges directly touches the lotus feet of Lord Vishnu (Narayana) before descending within this universe, it is known as Bhagavat-Padi or Vishnupadi which means Emanating from the lotus feet of Bhagavan (God). It finally settles in Brahmaloka or Brahmapura, abode of Lord Brahma before descending to planet Earth at the request of Bhagiratha and held safely by Lord Shiva on his head to prevent destruction of Bhumi Devi (Mother Earth). Then, the Ganges was released from Lord Shiva's hair to meet the needs of the country according to Hindu mythology. In other legends, Himavan fathered Parvati and Ganga.|$|E
25|$|No {{country in}} Europe {{possesses}} roofs to equal those of England {{created in the}} 15th century. The great roof of Westminster Hall remains {{to the present day}} unique. In Norfolk and Suffolk roofs abound of the hammerbeam class; that at Woolpit, Suffolk, achieves the first rank of quality. Each bracket is carved with strongly designed foliage, the end of every beam terminates in an angel carrying a shield, and the purlins are crested, while each truss is supported by a canopied riche (containing a figure) resting on an angel corbel. Here, too, as at Ipswich and many other churches, there is a row of angels with outspread wings under the wall-plate. This idea of angels in the roof is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>beautiful</b> one, and the effect is much enhanced by the coloring. The roof at St Nicholas, King's Lynn, is a magnificent example of tiebeam construction. The trusses are filled in with tracery at the sides and the centres more or less open, and the beams, which are crested and embattled, contain a row of angels on either side. In Devon, Cullompton possesses a very fine semicircular ceiling supported at intervals by ribs pierced with carving. Each compartment is divided up into small square panels, crossed by diagonal ribs of cresting, while every joint is ornamented with a boss carved in the decorative way peculiar to the Gothic craftsman. The nave roof of Manchester cathedral is nearly flat, and is also divided up into small compartments and bossed; the beams are supported by carved brackets resting on corbels with angels at each base.|$|E

500|$|After Allen's {{death in}} 1764, William Warburton, Allen's relative, {{lived in the}} house for some time and it was passed down to other family members and then purchased, in 1809, by John Thomas, a Bristol Quaker. After William Beckford sold Fonthill Abbey, in 1822, he was looking about for a {{suitable}} new seat, Prior Park was his first choice: [...] ""They wanted too much for it," [...] he recalled later; [...] "I should have liked it very much; it possesses such great capability of being made <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>beautiful</b> spot." [...] Prior Park was offered for sale after Thomas's death in 1827 but the asking price of £25,000 was not obtained and the offer of sale withdrawn.|$|E
500|$|She {{also was}} seen by [...] others as a sex symbol. Aaliyah {{did not have a}} problem with being {{considered}} one. [...] "I know that people think I'm sexy and I am looked at as that, and it is cool with me," [...] she stated. [...] "It's wonderful to have sex appeal. If you embrace it, it can be <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>beautiful</b> thing. I am totally cool with that. Definitely. I see myself as sexy. If you are comfortable with it, it can be very classy and it can be very appealing." [...] The single [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] was argued to have transformed [...] "the once tomboy into a sexy grown woman". Aaliyah mentioned that her mother, during her childhood, would take pictures of her and notice a sex appeal. She reinforced her mother's belief by saying that she did feel [...] "sexy for sure" [...] and that she embraced it and was comfortable with this view of her.|$|E
500|$|Although {{contained}} {{within a single}} stage set, the production was lavish, with 300 men employed to manipulate the stage machinery. Follino's report described the set as [...] "a wild rocky place {{in the midst of}} the waves, which in the furthest part of the prospect could be seen always in motion". As the action began, Apollo was revealed [...] "sitting on <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>beautiful</b> cloud... which, moving down little by little... reached in a short space of time the stage and... disappeared in a moment". Thereafter, all the performers proved excellent in the art of singing; [...] "every part succeeded more than wondrously". Follino's enthusiasm was echoed in other reports made by dignitaries to their own courts. The ambassador for the House of Este, who referred to the work as [...] "a comedy in music", mentioned in particular Andreini's performance which, in her lament, [...] "made many weep", and that of Francesco Rasi, who as Bacchus [...] "sang divinely". Monteverdi's fellow composer Marco da Gagliano wrote that Monteverdi's music had [...] "moved the entire audience to tears". In all, the opera lasted for two and a half hours.|$|E

500|$|Lionel {{also has}} a key {{relationship}} with Martha Kent, Clark Kent's adoptive mother. This relationship first develops in season two when Lionel hires Martha to be his assistant; it is further developed in season five. Glover felt Lionel's attraction to Martha grows in season five when Jonathan Kent dies because he now sees Martha as a single woman and is now more attainable; Glover believes Lionel was seeking to attain Martha's [...] "goodness" [...] and the attraction {{is not based on}} lust. When Lionel is in Martha's company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with; he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior. Writer Holly Harold said his relationship with Martha parallels Lex's relationship with Lana; both men believe these two women will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side. Annette O'Toole said Martha's interest in Lionel is like watching a dangerous animal; [...] "It's that attraction you have for <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>beautiful,</b> dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] O'Toole also said she believes Martha's motivation is to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When Martha left the show, writer Todd Slavkin said they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on screen. Slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave John Schneider because there were so many storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in. The writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the U.S. Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage. O'Toole and Al Gough said Martha has a small attraction to Lionel and that nothing serious would come from it.|$|E
500|$|O'Toole {{relished the}} {{opportunity}} {{that came with}} Jonathan's passing, {{even though she was}} saddened to see a friend leave the show. Martha taking the senate seat was a chance to explore more adult stories with her character beginning midway through season five, which was important for the actress since Clark was becoming an adult on the show. It also allowed for O'Toole the chance to depict [...] "strong emotions" [...] over Jonathan's death. Al Gough feels that Jonathan's passing allowed for them to explore more of Martha's smart and strong side, as well as her relationship with Lionel. The idea was to show that there was some form of attraction between Martha and Lionel, but that Martha would never have any romantic relationship with the billionaire, especially after all that he had done to her family. O'Toole likens Martha's interest in Lionel with that of watching a dangerous animal: [...] "It's that attraction you have for <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>beautiful,</b> dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] The actress believes that Martha's ultimate motivation was to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When it came time for Martha to leave the show, writer Todd Slavkin contends that they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on film. Slavkin explains that they could not do anything equivalent to what they gave John Schneider, as there were already so many storylines going on by the season six finale that they could not fit anything else in. The writers also realized that they could not kill off the character, and so chose to send her to the US Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage.|$|E
