5|$|Plant species often {{hybridize}} {{more readily}} than animal species, and the resulting hybrids are fertile more often. Many plant species <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of hybridization, combined with polyploidy, which duplicates the chromosomes. Chromosome duplication allows orderly meiosis and so viable seed can be produced.|$|E

5|$|The {{neutral theory}} of {{molecular}} evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift. Hence, in this model, most genetic {{changes in a}} population <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of constant mutation pressure and genetic drift. This form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned, since {{it does not seem}} to fit the genetic variation seen in nature. However, a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory, where a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population. Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking, also known as genetic draft.|$|E

5|$|A few {{animal species}} <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of hybridization. The Lonicera fly {{is a natural}} hybrid. The American red wolf {{appears to be a}} hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote, {{although}} its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy. The European edible frog is a semi-permanent hybrid between pool frogs and marsh frogs; its population requires the continued presence of {{at least one of the}} parent species. Cave paintings indicate that the European bison is a natural hybrid of the aurochs and the steppe bison.|$|E
40|$|Critically reading {{therapeutic}} trials {{consists in}} determining whether the treatment studied offers a sufficient and relevant benefit to patients in daily medical practice. Thus, critical reading implies that we answer the following questions : <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> reliable? <b>is</b> <b>the</b> trial’s methodology dependable? <b>are</b> <b>the</b> statistical <b>results</b> reliable? what is its epistemological value? <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> reproducible? have they been confirmed by other trials and are they consistent with our basic knowledge on <b>the</b> subject? <b>is</b> <b>the</b> effect size large enough and how precise is its estimation? what <b>is</b> <b>the</b> risk-benefit ratio? <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> relevant to daily clinical practice, and how representative <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> and can they be extrapolated...|$|R

5|$|As {{the most}} {{abundant}} large predator in the Morrison Formation, Allosaurus {{was at the top}} of the food chain, probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a hatchet.|$|E
5|$|Folk {{tales and}} myths {{sometimes}} contain mythological hybrids; the Minotaur was {{the offspring of}} a human, Pasiphaë, and a white bull. More often, they are composites of the physical attributes {{of two or more}} kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and humans, with no suggestion that they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of interbreeding, as in the centaur (man/horse), chimera (goat/lion/snake), hippocamp (fish/horse), and sphinx (woman/lion). The Old Testament mentions a first generation of half-human hybrid giants, the Nephilim, while the apocryphal Book of Enoch describes the Nephilim as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.|$|E
5|$|Genes with a {{most recent}} common ancestor, {{and thus a}} shared {{evolutionary}} ancestry, are known as homologs. These genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where they are known as paralogous genes, or <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of divergence of the genes after a speciation event, where they are known as orthologous genes, and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms. It is often assumed that the functions of orthologous genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes, although the difference is minimal.|$|E

5|$|In The Stuff of Thought (2007), Pinker {{looks at}} {{a wide range of}} issues around the way words related to {{thoughts}} on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to Stone Age life could work in the modern world. Many quirks of language <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the atoms}} {{that make up}} the Earth and its {{inhabitants}} were present in their current form in the nebula that collapsed out of a molecular cloud to form the Solar System. The rest <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of radioactive decay, and their relative proportion can be used to determine the age of the Earth through radiometric dating. Most of the helium in the crust of the Earth (about 99% of the helium from gas wells, as shown by its lower abundance of helium-3) is a product of alpha decay.|$|E
5|$|Near Cape Mendocino, the Mendocino Triple Junction {{is an area}} {{of active}} {{seismicity}} where three tectonic plates come together. The Mendocino Fracture Zone (also known as the Mendocino Fault east of the Gorda Ridge) is a transform fault that separates the Pacific and Gorda Plates. To the south, the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate is accommodated by the San Andreas Fault, and to the north, the Gorda Plate is converging with the North American Plate at the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Earthquakes within the Gorda Plate <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of north-south compression at the Mendocino Fault.|$|E

5|$|Pterodroma petrel remains dated {{at between}} 60,000 and 25,000 years BP {{were found in}} two cave sites in Gibraltar. They consist of a more {{abundant}} form similar in size to Zino's, and a larger, less common type. It is uncertain whether they represent {{the site of a}} former breeding colony, or <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a seabird wreck in which storms blow birds inland. They do suggest, however, that members of the genus were formerly more widespread.|$|E
5|$|Published {{partially}} {{in response}} to Dissenting clergyman Richard Price's sermon celebrating the French revolution, Burke used the device of a mock-letter to a young Frenchman's plea for guidance in order to defend aristocratic government, paternalism, loyalty, chivalry, and primogeniture. He viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections, he argues that citizens {{do not have the}} right to revolt against their government, because civilizations, including governments, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of social and political consensus. If a culture's traditions were continually challenged, he contends, the result would be anarchy.|$|E

5|$|Serpins are {{involved}} in a wide array of physiological functions, and so mutations in genes encoding them can cause a range of diseases. Mutations that change the activity, specificity or aggregation properties of serpins all affect how they function. The majority of serpin-related diseases <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of serpin polymerisation into aggregates, though several other types of disease-linked mutations also occur. The disorder α-Antitrypsin deficiency {{is one of the most}} common hereditary diseases.|$|E
5|$|Species are reproductively {{isolated}} {{by strong}} barriers to hybridisation, which include morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before fertilization and others after it. Similar barriers exist in plants, with differences in flowering times, pollen vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic sterility, cytoplasmic-genic male sterility {{and the structure}} of the chromosomes. A few animal species and many plant species, however, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of hybrid speciation, including important crop plants such as wheat, where the number of chromosomes has been doubled.|$|E
