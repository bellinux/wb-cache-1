5|$|The ACLU took no {{official}} position on president Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1937 court-packing plan, which threatened {{to increase the}} number of Supreme Court justices, unless the Supreme Court reversed its course and began approving New Deal legislation. The Supreme Court responded by making a major shift in policy, and no longer applied strict constitutional limits to government programs, and also began to take <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role in protecting civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|After his maiden speech, Breckinridge took <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> {{role in the}} House. In {{debate with}} Ohio's Joshua Reed Giddings, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's {{constitutionality}} and criticized Giddings for hindering the return of fugitive slaves. He opposed Tennessee Congressman Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill, fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two Potomac River bridges to avoid higher costs later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's hemp farmers, voting against giving the president ten more appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy, and opposing funds for a sculpture of George Washington because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a toga.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge and Minnesota Territory's Henry Mower Rice {{were among}} the speculators who {{invested}} in land near present-day Superior, Wisconsin. Rice disliked Minnesota's territorial governor, Willis A. Gorman, and petitioned Pierce to replace him with Breckinridge. Pierce twice investigated Gorman, but found no grounds to remove him from office. Breckinridge fell ill when traveling to view his investments in mid-1855 {{and was unable to}} campaign in the state elections. Know Nothings captured every state office and six congressional districts—including the Eighth District—and Breckinridge sent regrets to friends in Washington, D.C., promising to take <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role in the 1856 campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{consists of}} setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game– for example, {{where to place}} different pieces– while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These {{two parts of the}} chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play. A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.|$|E
5|$|For Myst III: Exile and Myst IV: Revelation, {{composer}} Jack Wall {{created the}} music, developing <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> musical style different from Miller's ambient themes. Wall {{looked at the}} increasing complexity of games {{as an opportunity to}} give players a soundtrack with as much force as a movie score, and tried to create a distinctive sound that was still recognizable as Myst music. In Revelation, Wall adapted the themes for the recurring characters of Myst, and collaborated with Peter Gabriel, who provided a song to the game as well as voicework.|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} of teichomycin A 2 was {{compared with that}} of vancomycin in vitro against clinical isolates of staphylococci and enterococci. Teichomycin <b>A</b> 2 was <b>more</b> <b>active</b> than vancomycin active against all isolates tested. Synergistic studies also demonstrated that teichomycin A 2 combined with rifampin is <b>more</b> <b>active</b> than vancomycin combined with rifampin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates. Teichomycin A 2, either singly or in combination with <b>an</b> aminoglycoside, was <b>more</b> <b>active</b> against Streptococcus faecalis isolates...|$|R
5|$|From the 1890s onwards, Muller had {{published}} with great regularity {{about the importance}} of a proper Dutch consular service to promote the Dutch mercantile interests around the world. In his articles he forcefully advanced the idea that the consular and diplomatic services should be merged and professionalised. In his publications Muller also strongly propagated <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role of the Netherlands in international affairs. In this vain, in 1919, he published an article on the history and geography of Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and the necessity for the Dutch government to defend its historic claims on the islands. A year later, the Dutch government became a signatory to the Spitsbergen Treaty.|$|E
5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather in the first few weeks of winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E
5|$|Kraft again {{found himself}} a spectator during the landing of Apollo 11, which he viewed from Mission Control, sitting with Gilruth and George Low. He played <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role in events during the {{unfolding}} of the Apollo 13 crisis. Called into Mission Control by Gene Kranz almost immediately after the accident, Kraft chaired the meeting of senior managers which decided the mode that Apollo 13 would use to return to Earth.|$|E

5|$|Most mantises chase tempting prey if it strays close enough, {{and will}} go further {{when they are}} {{especially}} hungry. Once within reach, mantises strike rapidly to grasp the prey with their spiked raptorial forelegs. Some ground and bark species pursue their prey in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> way. For example, members of a few genera such as the ground mantises, Entella, Ligaria, and Ligariella run over dry ground seeking prey, much as tiger beetles do.|$|E
5|$|On Arthur's advice, Sutherland takes orders, {{hoping that}} his doubts will {{eventually}} pass when he enters <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> life. Because of the selectivity of his sermons, however, his parishioners begin to suspect him of Socinianism. When Sutherland is tricked into making a harsh {{criticism of the}} British and Foreign Bible Society, claiming that {{the text of the}} Bible without clerical guidance is more likely to lead to wickedness than to Christian faith and virtue, his doubts are revealed, and he is forced to resign his position.|$|E
5|$|Since reunification, Germany {{has taken}} <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> {{role in the}} European Union. Together with its European {{partners}} Germany signed the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, established the Eurozone in 1999, and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to Afghanistan {{as part of a}} NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban. These deployments were controversial since Germany is bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles.|$|E

5|$|Susanto Pudjomartono, {{former chief}} editor of Tempo, became The Jakarta Post second chief editor on 1 August 1991, after Siagian {{was chosen to}} be Indonesia's {{ambassador}} to Australia. Under Pudjomartono's leadership, the paper began publishing more original work and doing less translation; reporters {{were also asked to}} take <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role in the day-to-day operations of the paper. The paper also became more vocal regarding politics, taking a pro-democracy stance like Tempo. It soon converted its offices into a new, two-story building built using the Kompas pension fund and expanded to 12 pages.|$|E
5|$|The initial concept talks for Final Fantasy VII {{began in}} 1994 at Final Fantasy {{developer}} Square, following {{the completion of}} Final Fantasy VI. As with the previous installment, series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi reduced his role to that of producer and granted others <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role in development: these included Yoshinori Kitase, who {{had been one of}} the directors of Final Fantasy VI. The next installment was initially planned as a 2D game for Nintendo's Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). After creating an early 2D prototype of Final Fantasy VII for the SNES, the team postponed development to help finish Chrono Trigger.|$|E
5|$|The post-war years {{also saw}} the News-Miner take <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role in {{territorial}} politics. Prior to the 1948 election, Lathrop believed Republican presidential candidate Thomas Dewey would handily defeat Democratic incumbent Harry Truman. To {{take advantage of the}} anticipated governmental shift, Lathrop instructed the News-Miner to ramp up its pro-Republican editorials. In order to assist that process, he appointed William Strand, a war correspondent for the Chicago Tribune, as the News-Miner's new editor. Though Truman won the 1948 election, the News-Miner stayed politically active in endorsing Republican candidates and issues. This ended only with Lathrop's death on July 26, 1950.|$|E

5|$|The stage musical {{follows the}} basic {{structure}} of the film, but there are some differences between the two. In this version, Ursula is Triton's sister and Ariel's aunt. In a new subplot, Grimsby holds a contest inviting all the princesses in the land for a singing competition for Eric to choose his bride; Ariel cannot sing, but she dances for Eric, and he chooses her. Ariel also has <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role in the final battle, where she is the one who defeats Ursula by destroying her Nautilus shell that contains her power.|$|E
5|$|Tisch was {{technically}} the team's co-chief {{executive at}} first, however given {{his lack of}} football knowledge he chose to defer to Wellington Mara on football decisions in his initial seasons with the club. Although he later took <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role in making decisions related to the football side of the team, in general, Tisch concentrated on the financial aspects, while Mara focused on the on-field product. After leading the league in attendance in 2001, the Giants finished second to Washington from 2002 to 2005.|$|E
5|$|After her repairs were completed, {{the ship}} {{spent most of}} 1941 on convoy escort duties before she was {{transferred}} to the Far East after the start of the Pacific War in December. Exeter was generally tasked with escorting convoys to and from Singapore during the Malayan Campaign and continued on those duties in early February 1942 as the Japanese prepared to invade the Dutch East Indies. Later that month, she was assigned to the Striking Force of the joint American-British-Dutch-Australian Command and took on <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>active</b> role in the defence of the Dutch islands. The culmination of this was her participation in the Battle of the Java Sea later in the month as the Allies attempted to intercept Japanese invasion convoys. Exeter was crippled early in the battle and did not play much of a role as she was forced to withdraw. Two days later, she attempted to escape inbound Japanese forces, but was intercepted and sunk by Japanese ships at the beginning of March in the Second Battle of the Java Sea.|$|E
