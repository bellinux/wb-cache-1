5|$|In November 2004, Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan {{were granted}} leave by the Ireland's High Court to pursue <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> have their September 2003 Vancouver {{marriage}} recognised for {{the filing of}} joint tax returns in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|After {{the slave}} ship reached port at Black River, Jamaica, Zongs owners made <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> their {{insurers}} {{for the loss}} of the slaves. When the insurers refused to pay, the resulting court cases (Gregson v Gilbert (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held that in some circumstances, the deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for the slaves' deaths. The judge, Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, ruled against the syndicate owners in this case, due to new evidence being introduced suggesting the captain and crew were at fault.|$|E
5|$|In 1328 Charles IV of France died {{without a}} male heir. Queen Isabella made <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> throne of France {{on behalf of}} her son Edward {{on the grounds that}} he was a matrilineal {{grandson}} of Philip IV of France. However, the precedents set by Philip V's succession over his niece Joan II of Navarre and Charles IV's succession over his nieces meant that the senior grandson of Philip III in the male line, Phillip of Valois, became king. Not yet in power, Edward paid homage to Phillip as Duke of Aquitaine.|$|E

5|$|In 1385, Elizabeth {{received}} an official delegation from Grand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania, {{who wished to}} marry Hedwig. In the Act of Kreva, Jogaila promised to pay compensation to William of Austria on Elizabeth's behalf and requested that Elizabeth, as widow of King Louis and heiress of Poland herself as great-grandniece of King Władysław I (whose name Jogaila had purposely assumed on his baptism), legally adopt him as her son {{in order to give}} him <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> the Polish crown in the event of Hedwig's death. The marriage was celebrated in 1386.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1912, he started {{training}} for the Olympics. He had confined his efforts to jumps, hurdles and shot-puts, but now added pole vaulting, javelin, discus, hammer and 56lb weight. In the Olympic trials held at Celtic Park in New York, his all-round ability stood out in all these events and so he riveted <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> {{a place on the}} team that went to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Major film {{studios in}} England include Pinewood, Elstree and Shepperton. Some {{of the most}} commercially {{successful}} films of all time have been produced in England, including two of the highest-grossing film franchises (Harry Potter and James Bond). Ealing Studios in London has <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> being the oldest continuously working film studio in the world. Famous for recording many motion picture film scores, the London Symphony Orchestra first performed film music in 1935.|$|E

5|$|Thomas' name {{suggests}} a strong likelihood {{that he came}} from Buittle in Kirkcudbrightshire, Galloway, lands in {{the control of the}} Douglas family. In 1388, it was claimed that he had been a scholar of Decrees (i.e. Canon law) at the University of Oxford for five years, <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> some extent confirmed by the grant of safe-conduct from the English crown on 18 February 1380, to travel and study at Oxford for a year.|$|E
5|$|Threefold {{repetition}} of position: This most commonly occurs when neither side {{is able to}} avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage. In this situation, either player can claim a draw; this requires the players to keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged. The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> be valid. FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check; this is merely {{a specific type of}} draw by threefold repetition.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1870s, Greece kept {{pressure}} on the Ottoman Empire, seeking territorial expansion into Epirus and Thessaly. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 provided the first potential alliance for the Greek kingdom. George's sister Dagmar was the daughter-in-law of Alexander II of Russia, and she sought to have Greece join the war. The French and British refused to countenance such an act, and Greece remained neutral. At the Congress of Berlin convened in 1878 to determine peace terms for the Russo-Turkish War, Greece staked <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> Crete, Epirus and Thessaly.|$|E

50|$|The preface paradox, or {{the paradox}} of the preface, was {{introduced}} by David Makinson in 1965. Similar to the lottery paradox, it presents an argument according to which it can be rational to accept mutually incompatible beliefs. While the preface paradox nullifies <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> contrary <b>to</b> one's belief, it is opposite to Moore's paradox which asserts <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> contrary <b>to</b> one's belief.|$|R
5|$|As unrest grew the 64th {{took place}} in an {{incident}} which lays <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> the first blood of the American War of Independence being shed in Salem, Massachusetts. On 26 February 1775 a supply of weapons and ammunition {{was known to be}} in Salem. The 64th, under their commander Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Leslie, were ordered to seize the weapons. American patriots in Salem were forewarned and tried to prevent the 64th from carrying out their orders. In the scuffle that ensued a local Salem man, Joseph Whicher, was slightly injured by a British bayonet. Negotiations prevented any further bloodshed and the 64th withdrew to Boston, their mission a failure.|$|E
5|$|Before 1923, Coghlan {{had opposed}} the {{amalgamation}} of Northern and Southern Rhodesia, concerned {{that it would}} make responsible government harder to attain. One outcome of the Jameson Raid in 1895–96 had been to prevent the concentration of the BSAC into one administration. Instead, the High Commission in Bechuanaland was maintained, Northern Rhodesia kept its own administration, and Britain oversaw BSAC affairs more closely. One year into his premiership, Coghlan began to consider territorial expansion and staked <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> northwestern Bechuanaland. The Dominions Office rejected the claim {{on the grounds that the}} Union of South Africa would respond with its own claim for the southern half of the territory.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1873, King's College, London Union Society which later, in 1908, reorganised into King's College London Students' Union, {{better known}} by its acronym KCLSU, is the oldest Students' Union in London (University College London Union being founded in 1893) and has <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> being the oldest Students' Union in England. Athletic Club {{was one of the}} nineteenth-century student {{societies}} at King's formed in 1884. The Students' Union provides a wide range of activities and services, including over 50 sports clubs (which includes the Boat Club which rows on the River Thames and the Rifle Club which uses King's College London's shooting range located at the disused Aldwych tube station beneath the Strand Campus), over 200 activity groups, a wide range of volunteering opportunities, two bars/eateries (The Waterfront and Guy's Bar), a shop (King's Shop) and a gym (Kinetic Fitness Club). Between 1992 and 2013 the Students' Union operated a nightclub, Tutu's, named after alumnus Desmond Tutu.|$|E

5|$|Harold was crowned on 6 January 1066 in Edward's new Norman-style Westminster Abbey, {{although}} some controversy surrounds who performed the ceremony. English sources claim that Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, performed the ceremony, while Norman sources {{state that the}} coronation was performed by Stigand, who was considered a non-canonical archbishop by the papacy. Harold's claim to the throne was not entirely secure, however, as there were other claimants, perhaps including his exiled brother Tostig. King Harald Hardrada of Norway also had <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> the throne as the uncle and heir of King Magnus I, who had made a pact with Harthacnut in about 1040 that if either Magnus or Harthacnut died without heirs, the other would succeed. The last claimant was William of Normandy, against whose anticipated invasion King Harold Godwinson made most of his preparations.|$|E
5|$|On 21 August 1245 Pope Innocent IV freed Béla of {{the oath}} of {{fidelity}} he had taken to Emperor Frederick during the Mongol invasion. In the following year Duke Frederick II of Austria invaded Hungary. He routed Béla's army in the Battle of the Leitha River on 15 June 1246, but perished in the battlefield. His childless death {{gave rise to a}} series of conflicts, because both his niece, Gertrude, and his sister, Margaret, made <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> Austria and Styria. Béla decided to intervene in the conflict only after the danger of a second Mongol invasion had diminished {{by the end of the}} 1240s. In retaliation of a former Austrian incursion into Hungary, Béla made a plundering raid into Austria and Styria in the summer of 1250. In this year he met and concluded a peace treaty with Daniil Romanovich, Prince of Halych in Zólyom (Zvolen, Slovakia). With Béla's mediation, a son of his new ally Roman married Gertrude of Austria.|$|E
5|$|St Mary's Hall, on an {{adjoining}} site to Stonyhurst, was {{built as a}} Jesuit seminary in 1828 (extended in the 1850s) and functioned until 1926, when the seminarians moved to Heythrop Hall. The poet Gerard Manley Hopkins, and John Tolkien, son of J. R. R. Tolkien, trained as priests there. During World War II, the English College left Benito Mussolini's Italy and occupied the hall. After their return to Rome, St Mary's Hall opened as a middle school in 1946. At the same time, Hodder Place continued to educate those aged eight to eleven, until its closure and conversion into flats in 1970. Hodder Place pupils moved up to St Mary's Hall to form Hodder Playroom. As successor to Hodder Place, St Mary's Hall has <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> being the oldest surviving preparatory school in Britain.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} results were announced on 23 February 1967 and the DMK won an absolute majority on its own. It had increased its vote share to 40.6% from 27.1% in 1962 election. Annadurai resigned as the Member of Parliament from the Madras South Lok Sabha constituency, which was later won by Murasoli Maran {{in the following}} by-election. Annadurai was nominated as Chief Minister of Madras State and staked <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> form a Government on 2 March 1967. He was sworn in by Governor Ujjal Singh on 6 March 1967 in Rajaji Hall. He was later elected to the Madras Legislative Council on 22 April 1967.|$|E
5|$|The rebel barons {{responded by}} {{inviting}} the French prince Louis to lead them: Louis had <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> the English throne {{by virtue of}} his marriage to Blanche of Castile, a granddaughter of Henry II. Philip may have provided him with private support but refused to openly support Louis, who was excommunicated by Innocent for taking part in the war against John. Louis' planned arrival in England presented a significant problem for John, as the prince would bring with him naval vessels and siege engines essential to the rebel cause. Once John contained Alexander in Scotland, he marched south to deal with the challenge of the coming invasion.|$|E
5|$|Whether Ragnall or Rǫgnvaldr, William's act {{of using}} a {{grandson}} of Óláfr in Caithness {{may have been an}} example of the king playing one member of the jarlsaetten against another. The jarlsaetten were people who possessed <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> an earldom, in accordance with Norse custom, by right of their descent from previous earls. There are earlier instances of such claimants requesting Scottish kings for what they considered their birthright, and William certainly did this when he granted Caithness to Haraldr Eiríksson, a grandson of Rǫgnvaldr Kali Kolsson, Earl of Orkney. If Ragnall was indeed a descendant of Ingibjǫrg, a daughter of Páll Hákonarson, Earl of Orkney (died 1137), he was directly descended from previous Scandinavian earls. Whereas Óláfr's marriage to Ingibjǫrg may have meant that Rǫgnvaldr was regarded {{as a member of the}} jarlsaetten as well, and a cousin to Haraldr himself.|$|E
2500|$|Review of the {{evidence}} is of no value to us. The vice is in the procedure which allows it in without testing it by cross-examination.
