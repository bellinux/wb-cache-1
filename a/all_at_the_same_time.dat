Roughly two dozen people worked on the game, though not <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b> It was initially planned for a 16-megabit cartridge, but four additional megabits were eventually added to expand the game. Development spanned about two years.|$|E

5|$|Carl Berners plass {{became a}} public {{transport}} station on 1 February 1923, when the then single-track Sinsen Line of the tramway opened as {{a branch of}} the Rodeløkka Line. The station took its name from the square it was located at, Carl Berners plass, which is again named for the politician Carl Berner. The station was served by the newly created Line 13 that operated through the city center and ran every twelve minutes, and since 29 June 1924 every fifteen minutes. The line was built by Kristiania Sporveisselskap, but they were taken over by the municipality in 1924, and the line became part of Oslo Sporveier. On 28 June 1938, the line was rebuilt to double track. From 19 December 1939, the line was extended along Trondheimsveien to Sinsen; this section was built with double track. In 1948, the tracks at Carl Berners plass was rebuilt to run through the roundabouts {{at both ends of the}} square. The station was served by various services numbers along the Sinsen Line, including 1, 3, 7, 13 and 17, although not <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b> At the most, three services operated to the station, giving a five-minute headway.|$|E

25|$|Pains {{occupy a}} {{distinct}} and vital {{place in the}} philosophy of mind for several reasons. One is that pains seem to collapse the appearance/reality distinction.

25|$|Barotraumas of ascent {{are also}} caused when the free change of {{volume of the}} gas in a closed space {{in contact with the}} diver is prevented. In this case the {{pressure}} difference causes a resultant tension in the surrounding tissues which exceeds their tensile strength. Besides tissue rupture, the overpressure may cause ingress of gases into the tissues and further afield through the circulatory system. This pulmonary barotrauma (PBt) of ascent is also known as pulmonary over-inflation syndrome (POIS), lung over-pressure injury (LOP) and burst lung. Consequent injuries may include arterial gas embolism, pneumothorax, mediastinal, interstitial and subcutaneous emphysemas, not usually <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

Eventually the publisher must contemplate an increase to the annual subscription rate. The new annual rate usually has to be announced in September before the next calendar year.|$|E
25|$|On 28 October 2011, the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission {{presented}} a timetable in a draft report titled, “how to scrap the Fukushima reactors”. Within 10 years, a start {{should be made}} with the retrieval of the melted fuel within the reactors. First, the containment vessels of reactors 1, 2 and 3 should be repaired, then all should be filled with water to prevent radiation releases. Decommissioning {{would take more than}} 30 years, because the pressure vessels of the reactor vessels are damaged also. After the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, some 70 percent of the fuel rods had melted. There, the retrieval of the fuel was started in 1985, and completed in 1990. The work at Fukushima was expected to take significantly longer because of the far greater damage and the fact that 4 reactors would need to be decommissioned <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

25|$|Muhammad was monogamously {{married to}} Khadija, his first wife, for 25 years, until she died. After her death, he married {{multiple}} women, mostly widows, {{for social and}} political reasons. He had a total of nine wives, but not <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> depending on the sources in his lifetime. The Qur'an does not give preference in marrying more than one wife. One reason cited for polygyny {{is that it allows}} a man to give financial protection to multiple women, who might otherwise not have any support (e.g. widows). However, the wife can set a condition, in the marriage contract, that the husband cannot marry another woman during their marriage. In such a case, the husband cannot marry another woman as long as he is married to his wife. According to traditional Islamic law, each of those wives keeps their property and assets separate; and are paid mahar and maintenance separately by their husband. Usually the wives have little to no contact with each other and lead separate, individual lives in their own houses, and sometimes in different cities, though they all share the same husband.|$|E
