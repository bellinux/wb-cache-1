In exchange, the state received ownership <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> NY394 between US20 and NY5 in the town of Westfield, US62 from NY60 to NY394 through the hamlet of Frewsburg, and Forest Avenue from the Pennsylvania state line in Busti to NY60 in Jamestown.

NY3 continued to end at the super two until the early 1980s.
