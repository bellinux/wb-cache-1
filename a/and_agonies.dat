60|$|We are {{not going}} to follow the worthy old {{stockbroker}} through those last pangs <b>and</b> <b>agonies</b> of ruin through which he passed before his commercial demise befell. They declared him at the Stock Exchange; he was absent from his house of business: his bills were protested: his act of bankruptcy formal. The house and furniture of Russell Square were seized and sold up, and he and his family were thrust away, as we have seen, to hide their heads where they might.|$|E
60|$|What {{a strange}} idea--such {{a life and}} death! It seemed to me, that I could see a funeral train {{creeping}} along; the monks, with their black cloaks, carrying tapers, and singing psalms; the whole procession together not larger in proportion than a swarm of black gnats; and yet, perhaps, hearts there wrung with an infinite sorrow. In that black, moving point, may be a soul, whose convulsions <b>and</b> <b>agonies</b> cannot be measured or counted by any thing human, so impossible is it to measure souls by space.|$|E

6000|$|A most {{peculiar}} and affecting {{feature of}} that form of brain disease which hurries its victim, as by an overpowering mania, into crime, is, that often the moral faculties and the affections remain {{to a degree}} unimpaired, and protest with all their strength against the outrage.

Mr Verloc wallowed on his back. But he longed for a more perfect rest—for sleep—for a few hours of delicious forgetfulness. That would come later. Provisionally he rested. And he thought: “I wish she would give over this damned nonsense. It’s exasperating.” ...|$|E

60|$|During {{all this}} time, {{notwithstanding}} the coolness and deliberation with which these avengers of their murdered countryman acted, {{the fires of}} their resentment and revenge were slowly but steadily burning, {{and as soon as}} the spring opened, they put themselves in battle array, and marched into the dominions of Ella. Ella did all that it was possible to do to meet and oppose them, but the spirit of retaliation and rage which his cruelties had evoked was too strong to be resisted. His country was ravaged, his army was defeated, he was taken prisoner, and the dying terrors <b>and</b> <b>agonies</b> of Ragnar among the serpents were expiated by tenfold worse tortures which they inflicted upon Ella's mutilated body, by a process too horrible to be described.|$|E
60|$|I {{think it}} is terrible to be young. The ecstasies <b>and</b> <b>agonies</b> of love, the agonies and ecstasies of fear and doubt and drop-by-drop fulfillment, realization. The awful process of human {{relationships}}, love and marital relationships especially. Because we all make a very, very bad start to-day, with our idea of love in our head, and our sex in our head as well. All the fight till one is bled of one's self-consciousness and sex-in-the-head. All the bitterness of the conflict with this devil of an amiable spouse, who has got herself so stuck in her own head. It is terrible to be young.--But one fights one's way through it, till one is cleaned: the self-consciousness and sex-idea burned out of one, cauterized out bit by bit, and the self whole again, and at last free.|$|E

60|$|Malcolm felt {{a certain}} exaltation in being enough {{like other people}} to have a lady-love, but {{there was not much}} comfort otherwise; indeed, he could so little have {{addressed}} Esclairmonde that it was almost a satisfaction that she was the centre of a group of maidens whose lovers or brothers either had been sent off beforehand, or who saw their attentions paid elsewhere, and who all alike gravitated towards the Demoiselle de Luxemburg for sympathy. He could but hover on the outskirts, conscious that he must cut a ridiculous figure, but unable to detach himself from the neighbourhood of the magnet. As he looked back on the happy weeks of unconstrained intercourse, when he came to her as freely as did these young girls with all his troubles, he felt as if the King had destroyed all his joy and peace, and yet that these flutterings of heart <b>and</b> <b>agonies</b> of shame and fits of despair were worth all that childish calm.|$|E
60|$|This {{is partly}} mere mistake in us; we build brown brick walls, and wear brown coats, {{because we have}} been blunderingly taught to do so, and go on doing so mechanically. There is, however, also some cause for the change in our own tempers. On the whole, these are much sadder ages than the early ones; not sadder in a noble and deep way, but in a dim wearied way,--the way of ennui, and jaded intellect, and uncomfortableness of soul and body. The Middle Ages had their wars <b>and</b> <b>agonies,</b> but also intense delights. Their gold was dashed with blood; but ours is {{sprinkled}} with dust. Their life was inwoven with white and purple: ours is one seamless stuff of brown. Not that we are without apparent festivity, but festivity more or less forced, mistaken, embittered, incomplete--not of the heart. How wonderfully, since Shakspere's time, have we lost the power of laughing at bad jests! The very finish of our wit belies our gaiety.|$|E

Do you not know that {{where there is a}} will there is a way--that {{whatever}} Man really wishes to do he will finally discover a means of doing? Well, you have done your best, you virtuous ladies, and others of your way of thinking, to bend Man's mind wholly towards honorable love as the highest good, and to understand by honorable love romance and beauty and happiness in the possession of beautiful, refined, delicate, affectionate women. You have taught women to value their own youth, health, shapeliness, and refinement above all things. Well, what place have squalling babies and household cares in this exquisite paradise of the senses and emotions? Is it not the inevitable end of it all that the human will shall say to the human brain: Invent me a means by which I can have love, beauty, romance, emotion, passion without their wretched penalties, their expenses, their worries, their trials, their illnesses <b>and</b> <b>agonies</b> and risks of death, their retinue of servants and nurses and doctors and schoolmasters.|$|E
6000|$|If {{the man has}} {{no purpose}} for his days, then to the woman alone remains the goal of her nights: the great sex goal. And this goal is no goal, but always cries for the {{something}} beyond: for the rising {{in the morning and}} the going forth beyond, the man disappearing ahead into the distance of futurity, that which his purpose stands for, the future. The sex goal needs, absolutely needs, this further departure. And if there be no further departure, no great way of belief on ahead: and if sex is the starting point and the goal as well: then sex becomes like the bottomless pit, insatiable. It demands at last the departure into death, the only available beyond. Like Carmen, or like Anna Karenina. When sex is the starting point and the returning point both, then the only issue is death. Which is plain as a pike-staff in [...] "Carmen" [...] or [...] "Anna Karenina," [...] and is the theme of almost all modern tragedy. Our one hackneyed, hackneyed theme. Ecstasies <b>and</b> <b>agonies</b> of love, and final passion of death. Death is the only pure, beautiful conclusion of a great passion. Lovers, pure lovers should say [...] "Let it be so." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{is one of}} {{the trials}} of our mortal state, one of the {{disciplines}} of our virtue, that the world's benefactors and reformers are so often without form or comeliness. The very force necessary to sustain the conflict makes them appear unlovely; they [...] "tread the wine press alone, and of the people there is none with them." [...] The shrieks, and groans, <b>and</b> <b>agonies</b> of men wrestling in mortal combat are often not graceful or gracious; but the comments that the children of the Puritans, and the children of the Covenanters, make on the ungraceful and severe elements which marked the struggles of their great fathers, are as ill-timed as if a son, whom a mother had just borne from a burning dwelling, should criticize the shrieks with which she sought him, and point out to ridicule the dishevelled hair and singed garments which show how she struggled for his life. But these are they which are [...] "sown in weakness, but raised in power; which are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory:" [...] even in this world they will have their judgment day, and their names which went down in the dust like a gallant banner trodden in the mire, shall rise again all glorious in the sight of nations.|$|E
