50|$|The first {{sampling}} oscilloscope was an analog instrument, originally {{developed as a}} front-end unit for a conventional oscilloscope. The need for this instrument {{grew out of the}} requirement of nuclear scientists at Harwell to capture the waveform of very fast repetitive pulses. The current state-of-the-art oscilloscopes — with bandwidths of typically 20 MHz — were not able to do this and the 300 MHz effective bandwidth of their <b>analog</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> represented a considerable advance.|$|E
50|$|Digital <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> {{operate on}} the same {{principle}} as <b>analog</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> and, like their analog counterparts, are of great use when analyzing high-frequency signals; that is, repetitive signals whose frequencies are higher than the <b>oscilloscope's</b> <b>sampling</b> rate. For measuring repetitive signals, this type can have bandwidth and high-speed timing up to ten times greater than any real-time oscilloscope.|$|R
25|$|A {{standard}} DSO {{is limited}} to capturing signals with a bandwidth of {{less than half the}} sampling rate of the ADC (called the Nyquist limit). There is a variation of the DSO called the digital <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> that can exceed this limit for certain types of signal, such as high-speed communications signals, where the waveform consists of repeating pulses. This type of DSO deliberately samples at a much lower frequency than the Nyquist limit and then uses signal processing to reconstruct a composite view of a typical pulse. A similar technique, with analog rather than digital samples, was used before the digital era in <b>analog</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes.</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} an algorithm {{for determining the}} fine phase response of equivalent <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> of a linear time-invariant response function from its magnitude. The Nose-to-Nose (NTN) calibration method can give the phase response of the equivalent <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes,</b> but the phase resolution can only achieve 250 MHz because the limit of the technology. In this study the fine phase response has been reconstructed. Although the truncation of the Kramers-Kronig transform using three basic functions may approximate gives rise to large errors in estimated phase, these errors may {{be approximated by using}} three basic functions. This result rests on data obtained by an NTN technique in combination with a swept-sine calibration procedure. The NTN technique yields magnitude and phase information over a broad bandwidth, yet has low frequency resolution. The swept-sine procedure returns only the magnitude of the oscilloscope response function, yet can be made at any frequency at which fundamental microwave power standards are available. As an example, we get the fine phase response of equivalent <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> Agilent 86100 C from dc to 40 GHz; its frequency resolution achieves 1 MHz. In the process of this analysis, we observe that the true oscilloscope response function as measured by the NTN calibration is indistinguishable from the reconstructed phase response over a very large bandwidth. At last we analyze the phase uncertainty of the phase response, and the uncertainty analysis process is provided. The results show that the algorithm can be used to get the fine phase response of the equivalent <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{to find the}} individual impulse response of broadband <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> (HP 54124 T, 50 GHz bandwidth). The method {{is based on the}} fact that, when the <b>oscilloscope</b> is <b>sampling</b> a DC-voltage, pulses are launched from the sampler towards the input connector. These pulses contain information on the scope's characteristic and can be measured by a second oscilloscope. This type of measurement is called a "nose-to-nose" calibration. Applying deconvolution techniques to the result of this measurement the characteristic of the two scopes can be found, assuming that the two scopes are identical. To avoid relying on this assumption, three oscilloscopes can be used. The "nose-to-nose" is then applied three times, with a different pair of scopes connected together each time. The individual characteristics of the three <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> are then calculated. Both SPICE simulations and close correspondence between swept-sine measurements and this method indicate that it is [...] ...|$|R
