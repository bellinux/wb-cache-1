40|$|<b>Ankylosing</b> <b>hyperostosis</b> is a {{condition}} in which new bone is laid down on the right antero-lateral aspect of the dorsal vertebrae and across the intervertebral spaces forming spurs or bridges. The lumbar and cervical spines, pelvis, hips, and knees may also be involved. There is no single approved name for this condition. Oppenheimer (1942) described 'Calcifi-cation and ossification of vertebral ligaments'. Forestier and Rotes-Querol (1950) named it 'senile <b>ankylosing</b> <b>hyperostosis</b> of the spine', but in later works (Forestier and Lagier, 1971) the adjective 'senile ' was omitted when the condition was described in younger patients.

5|$|Several Smilodon fossils {{show signs}} of <b>ankylosing</b> spondylitis, <b>hyperostosis</b> and trauma; some also had arthritis, which gave them fused vertebrae. One study of 1,000 Smilodon skulls found that 30% of them had eroded parietal bones, {{which is where the}} largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the {{weakening}} and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical stress from the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines. Bony growths where the deltoid muscle inserted in the humerus is a common pathology for a La Brea specimen, which was probably due to repeated strain when Smilodon attempted to pull down prey with its forelimbs. Sternum injuries are also common, probably due to collision with prey. Some bones also show evidence of having been bitten by other Smilodon, with one skull showing an unhealed wound from a canine, seemingly fatal, and a scapula from the same site that had been pierced by a canine. The frequency of trauma in S. fatalis specimens was 4.3%, compared to 2.8% in the dire wolf, which implies the ambush predatory behavior of the former led to greater risk of injury than the pursuit predatory behavior of the latter. Smilodon remains exhibit relatively more shoulder and lumbar vertebrae injuries.|$|R
40|$|We {{experienced}} a case {{who received a}} bone resection for <b>ankylosing</b> spinal <b>hyperostosis</b> through the anterior approach. He subsequently became asphyxic and suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest owing to a postoperative hematoma. His complaint before the surgery was sticking of his throat and dyspnea that continued for 3 years. X-ray films revealed an osteophyte on the anterior side of the C 3 -C 6 vertebral bodies, and we made an anterior approach under general anesthesia. There were no problems during the surgery. After being returned to the ward without intubation, he complained {{that he had a}} catch in his throat that progressed little by little, and subsequently suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest at 5 hours after surgery. Upon revival, he had brain hypoxia. He passed away owing to malnutrition and pneumonia at 4 years after the surgery. To prevent this complication, {{it is important to have}} an understanding of this condition. We should have alerted the nurses that such a complication may occur after anterior spinal surgery. It is also important to be aware that intubation of such a case becomes difficult once the trachea has become compressed and curved because of a hematoma. 頸椎前方アプローチの術後合併症として術後血腫およびそれによる気管，食道の圧迫が挙げられるが，窒息まで至る症例は非常に希である．今回，我々は強直性脊椎骨増殖症に対して前方アプローチにて骨棘切除術を施行した後に，術後血腫で窒息し，心肺停止をきたした症例を経験した．症例は 51 歳の男性．主訴は 3 年前からの喉のつかえ，息苦しさであった．単純X線でC 3 - 6 前方に骨増殖性の骨棘を認め，手術は全麻下に前方アプローチで侵入した．術中トラブルなく，抜管後に病棟へ帰室したが，徐々に咽頭部違和感を自覚し，術後約 5 時間で心肺停止になった．蘇生後，低酸素脳症による症状が持続したが，術後 4 年経過後に栄養不良と肺炎で永眠した．問題点として，術後の頸部の腫脹がガーゼで確認しにくかった点や，看護師への前方アプローチでの危険性の啓蒙が不十分であったこと，などが挙げられる．また，一旦血腫による窒息を生じると，気管は圧迫弯曲するため，挿管は極めてしにくくなり，先に血腫を掻き出さなければならない場合があることは注意を要する．頸椎前方固定術後，合併症の危険性を改めて認識すべきである...|$|R
40|$|Shoulder pain is {{a common}} {{complaint}} and shoulder hyperostosis a frequent radiological condition. However, {{little is known about}} the association between the clinical and radiological findings. To evaluate the clinical relevance of shoulder hyperostosis we performed a controlled, blind study of 99 hospitalized probands with and without thoracospinal hyper-ostosis on lateral chest X-rays. The study included grading of the shoulder hyperostosis on the basis of three bilateral stan-dard radiographs, assessing shoulder pain in a standardized way by an interviewer and recording extraskeletal causes of shoulder pain. The prevalence of shoulder hyperostosis was doubled in probands with thoracospinal hyperostosis com-pared to controls (/ — 5. 90, F< 0. 025, n = 99). Shoulder hyperostosis, irrespective of thoracospinal hyperostosis, predis-posed to shoulder pain (40 % versus 18 %, x 2 = 4. 06, F< 0. 05, n = 74). Shoulder hyperostosis in combination with thoracospinal hyperostosis (shoulder DISH) predisposed to shoulder pain to an even greater extent (46 % versus 12 %, x 2 = 6. 64, P< 0. 01, n = 47). We conclude that shoulder hyperostosis is a radiological finding of potential clinical relevance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} radiographic development of ossigication of the anterior longitudinal ligament to clarify the new bone formation. In this report, 30 patients with spinal cord injury were studied. The mean follow-up period was 15. 5 years with a range from 5. 4 to 31. 0 years. The results were as follows : In the cervical spine, the narrowing of the intervertebral discs was more common in <b>ankylosing</b> <b>hyperostosis</b> group when compared to the non-anlylosing hyperostosis group. On the other hand, in the thoracic and lumber spines, cise versa. There is tendency to invrease the degree of thoracic kyphosis and decrease that of lumber lordosis in the <b>ankylosing</b> <b>hyperostosis</b> group. Considering that ossification was found prediminantly in the thoracolumber spine, we think the ”relaxation” of the anterior longitudinal ligaments participate somehow in the formation of ossification of anterior longitudinal ligament. The development of ossification was classfied roughtly into two groups. In one group it progressed slowly over a long period, and in the other group after rapid progression in early stage, it did not increase or was rather reduced as time passed. Concerning a direcrion of ossigication there was a tendency that in the cervical vertebrae it developed down and in the lumber vertebare it tended to develop down. According to the result of the long term follow-uo study, we think that the inportant factor in the development of ossification of anterior longitudinal ligament is not only diffuse ossifing diathesis but local biomechanical...|$|E
40|$|Dysphagia having multifactorial etiologies is a {{frequent}} complaint in otolaryngological practice. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis syndrome (DISH) is a rare cause of dysphagia.

It was first described by Forestier and Rotes-Querol in 1950. The primary diagnosis is radiological and its etiology has not been exactly identified. The most common symptoms are neck pain, limitation of movement, and dysphagia, yet, aspiration, dyspnea, and laryngeal stridor may also be seen rarely. We present a 45 years-old female patient admitted only for dysphagia and aspiration whose complaints were completely revealed after treatment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction A girl {{presented}} with achondroplasia manifested as mild knee pain associated with stiffness of her back. A skeletal survey showed enchondroma-like metaphyseal dysplasia and ossification of the spinal ligaments. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the spine}} further clarified the pathological composites. Case presentation A 7 -year-old girl {{presented with}} the classical phenotypic features of achondroplasia. Radiographic documentation showed the co-existence of metaphyseal enchondromatosis and development of spinal bony ankylosis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive ossification of the anterior and posterior spinal ligaments. Additional features revealed by magnetic resonance imaging included calcification of the peripheral vertebral bodies associated with anterior end-plate irregularities. Conclusion Enchondromas are metabolically active and may continue to grow and evolve throughout the patient's lifetime; thus, progressive calcification {{over a period of}} years is not unusual. Ossification of the spinal ligaments has a specific site of predilection and often occurs in combination with senile <b>ankylosing</b> vertebral <b>hyperostosis.</b> Nevertheless, ossification of the spinal ligaments has been encountered in children with syndromic malformation complex. It is a multifactorial disease in which complex genetic and environmental factors interact, potentially leading to chronic pressure on the spinal cord and nerve roots with subsequent development of myeloradiculopathy. Our patient presented with a combination of achondroplasia, enchondroma-like metaphyseal dysplasia and calcification of the spinal ligaments. We suggest that the development of heterotopic bone formation along the spinal ligaments had occurred through an abnormal ossified enchondral mechanism. We postulate that ossification of the spinal ligaments and metaphyseal enchondromatous changes are related to each other and represent impaired terminal differentiation of chondrocytes in this particular case. Standard radiographic examination showed spinal bony ankylosis only. The pathological composites of the vertebrae have been clarified using scanning technology. Extensive spinal ligament ossification associated with calcification of the peripheral vertebral bodies and anterior end-plate irregularities were notable. We report what may be a novel spinal and extraspinal malformation complex in a girl with achondroplasia. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{arthritis}} in Roman Britain was investigated {{by examining the}} skeletons of 416 adults from the Roman cemetery at Poundbury Camp near Dorchester, Dorset. The mean height of the people was not much {{less than that of}} the current British population, and the prevalence of right handedness was similar to our own. There was a high prevalence of osteoarthritis for such a relatively young community, with particularly severe changes in the vertebral column. The pattern of joints affected by osteoarthritis was different from that seen now, but the prevalence of vertebral <b>ankylosing</b> <b>hyperostosis</b> was much the same. Rheumatoid arthritis was seen as often as the expected rat would indicate, given that the population died young, but it was rare.

40|$|Comparison of {{the skeletons}} of {{stranded}} or river-dwelling bottle-nosed dolphins {{with those of}} delphinarium specimens revealed {{that many of the}} former animals had suffered from various diseases. Most wild specimens have broken or lost a part of their teeth or even all of them. In a few cases they show signs of bone erosion (probably by abscesses), bone neoformation, and in a single case a broken mandible. Teeth abrasion may start early in life. Also delphinarium specimens may have broken teeth. Broken ribs can be found in half of the number of specimens. In the wild the ribs healed nicely, but in the delphinarium they hardly did. All the wild specimens show periosteitic phenomena to some degree. Delphinarium specimens are not excepted from them. In one of the old specimens foramina became partially occluded. <b>Ankylosing</b> <b>hyperostosis</b> is seen in two specimens. It is advised that during autopsies attention is paid to the condition of the teeth, the solidity of the rib-cage and the general state of the skeleton...|$|E
40|$|A {{radiological}} {{study of}} the sacroiliac joints was undertaken in 54 patients (32 males, 22 females) with vertebral <b>ankylosing</b> <b>hyperostosis</b> (VAH) and in 46 control patients (24 males, 22 females) matched for age and sex. The ages ranged from 38 to 90 years. The radiographs were taken in anteroposterior, oblique, and craniocaudal projections. The films were read for cranial, ventral, and caudal capsular ossifications, for ventral and caudal osteophytes, and for bone sclerosis. Cranial and/or ventral capsular ossifications were found in 28 (87. 5 %) males with VAH and in 4 (16. 6 %) control males (p less than 0. 0005), but only in 2 females with VAH and no control female. Sacroiliac capsular ossifications in males with VaH are frequent from the onset, but complete bridging of the joint is not reached before the sixth decade. Women, either VAH or control, have more sacroiliac osteophytes than men. There were 11 out of 22 control women with osteophytes versus 4 out of 24 men (p less than 0. 025). The incidence of osteophytes {{does not seem to}} increase with age after 50 years. Our findings support the idea of VAH being a distinct entity and not a major form of osteophytosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of {{diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis}} (DISH) was studied {{in a hospital}} based population of African Blacks over the age of 40 years. The study was based on an analysis of the lateral chest radiographs of 1000 patients in a retrospective study and 500 consecutive medical admissions in a prospective study. The overall {{prevalence of}} DISH was 3. 9 % (males 3. 8 % and females 4. 2 %). There was a rise in the prevalence of DISH with increasing age from 1 % in the 40 - 49 year age group to 13. 6 % in those over 70 years. The prevalence of diabetes was 52. 4 % in the 21 patients with DISH who were seen in the prospective analysis. Ankylosing spondylitis, which is associated with HLA-B 27, is rare in African Blacks. However, DISH is not uncommon but its prevalence is lower than in a similar hospital based study of Jews in Israel. KEY WORDS: Spine, Ageing, Race, Diabetes, Prevalence. HYPEROSTOSIS of the spine has been recognized since the nineteenth century but was first studied systemat-ically by Forestier and Rotes-Querol [1] and was called senile <b>ankylosing</b> <b>hyperostosis</b> or Forestier's disease. Involvement of the appendicular skeleton was recog-nized by Resnick et al. [2] and the name diffuse idio-pathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) proposed.

40|$|Diffuse {{idiopathic}} skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is {{a relatively}} common disorder predominating in men (65 to 70 percent),i with a prevalence of ap-proximately 3 percent in adults older than 40 years of age 2 and from 12 percent to 15 percent in patients more than 65 years of age. 3, 4 In 1950 Forestier and Rotes-Querol 5 introduced the term senile <b>ankylosing</b> <b>hyperostosis</b> of the spine. DISH has long been regarded as a radiographic entity char-acterized by calcification and ossification of the anterolateral aspects of the vertebral column whose clinical manifestations (usually thoraco-lumbar or cervical stiffness) are minor and of little consequence. Some severe neurologic com-plications, however, resulting from spinal cord compression have been recently reported. 6 -B Typically, ossification of the posterior longitudi-nalligament of the spine has not been considered a component of this process, and its prevalence {{is estimated to be}} approximately 6 percent in indi-viduals more than 65 years of age. 9 Nevertheless, Resnick, et al. lO reported that ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament occurs in 50 per-cent of patients suffering from DISH. Reported here is a patient who experienced progressive quadriparesis. Diagnostic studies evidenced the existence of both disorders. A brief discussion and recommended strategies follow.
