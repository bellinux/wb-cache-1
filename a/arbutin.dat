50|$|<b>Arbutin</b> is a glycoside; a glycosylated {{hydroquinone}} {{extracted from}} the bearberry plant in the genus Arctostaphylos. It inhibits tyrosinase and thus prevents the formation of melanin. <b>Arbutin</b> is therefore used as a skin-lightening agent. <b>Arbutin</b> is found in wheat, and is concentrated in pear skins. It {{is also found in}} Bergenia crassifolia. <b>Arbutin</b> was also produced by an in vitro culture of Schisandra chinensis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Arbutin</b> is glucosylated hydroquinone, and {{may carry}} similar cancer risks, {{although}} there are also claims that <b>arbutin</b> reduces cancer risk. The German Institute of Food Research in Potsdam found that intestinal bacteria can transform <b>arbutin</b> into hydroquinone, which creates an environment favorable for intestinal cancer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Arbutin</b> {{is derived}} from the leaves of bearberry, cranberry, {{mulberry}} or blueberry shrubs, and also is present in most types of pears. It can have melanin-inhibiting properties. <b>Arbutin</b> and other plant extracts are considered safe alternatives to commonly used depigmenting agents to make the skin fairer. Medical studies have shown the efficiency of <b>arbutin</b> for skin lightening. There are patents controlling its use for skin lightening. <b>Arbutin</b> actually exists in two isomers, alpha and beta. The alpha isomer offers higher stability over the beta isomer and is the preferred form for skin lightening indications.|$|E
50|$|Arctostaphylos uva-ursi {{contains}} the glycoside <b>arbutin.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{bearberry}} (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), <b>arbutin</b> {{is converted}} to hydroquinone.|$|E
50|$|The {{capacity}} of taxifolin to stimulate fibril formation and promote stabilization of fibrillar forms of collagen {{can be used}} in medicine. Also taxifolin inhibited the cellular melanogenesis as effectively as <b>arbutin,</b> {{one of the most widely}} used hypopigmenting agents in cosmetics. However, <b>arbutin</b> acts as quercetin extremely mutagenic, carcinogenic and toxic.|$|E
50|$|Bearberry, which {{contains}} <b>arbutin,</b> {{is a traditional}} treatment for urinary tract infections.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{alternative}} lighteners {{are derived from}} natural sources of hydroquinone. These include Mitracarpus scaber extract, Uva ursi (bearberry) extract, Morus bombycis (mulberry), Morus alba (white mulberry), and Broussonetia papyrifera (paper mulberry). All of these contain <b>arbutin</b> (technically known as hydroquinone-β-D-glucoside), which can inhibit melanin production. Pure forms of <b>arbutin</b> are considered more potent for affecting skin lightening.|$|E
50|$|Bergenia crassifolia {{contains}} the polyphenols <b>arbutin,</b> kaempferol 3-lathyroside, catechin 3-O-gallate, tannins and the pectin bergenan.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{principal}} {{ingredients that}} are used in skin lightening cosmetics are <b>arbutin</b> and kojic acid. [...] <b>Arbutin,</b> often also called bearberry, can be converted by the body into hydroquinone. [...] Azelaic acid with natural products like Aloe Vera and vitamin C tablets is another method. Kojic acid was developed as a safer alternative to hydroquinone, however it is less effective at lightening and also carcinogenic.|$|E
50|$|Pure <b>arbutin</b> can be {{prepared}} synthetically from the reaction of acetobromoglucose and hydroquinone {{in the presence of}} alkali.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of glucosides found in natural phenols and polyphenols, as, for example, in the {{flavonoids}} chemical family. <b>Arbutin,</b> which occurs in bearberry along with methyl <b>arbutin,</b> hydrolyses to hydroquinone and glucose. Pharmacologically it acts as a urinary antiseptic and diuretic; Salicin, also termed saligenin and glucose occurs in the willow. The enzymes ptyalin and emulsin convert it into glucose and saligenin, ortho-oxybenzylalcohol. Oxidation gives the aldehyde helicin.|$|E
50|$|R. ferrugineum is {{moderately}} toxic, containing <b>arbutin,</b> arecoline and rhodoxanthin, and {{can cause}} vomiting, and difficulties of the digestive, nervous, respiratory and circulatory systems.|$|E

50|$|A 2014 {{study of}} 210 {{patients}} randomized into two treatment groups found that recurrence occurred within 2 months in 27.6% {{of the group}} using antibiotics alone (prulifloxacin 600 mg), but in only 7.8% of the group taking prulifloxacin in combination with Serenoa repens extract, Lactobacillus Sporogens and <b>Arbutin.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is a {{long-lived}} species, reaching 100 {{years of}} age or more, though it does not begin to fruit until it is around 20 years old. The shrub is allelopathic, inhibiting the growth of other plants in its understory when rain leaches toxic <b>arbutin</b> and phenolic acids from its foliage.|$|E
50|$|The species {{produces}} acid aerobically from glucose (without gas), fructose, sucrose, trehalose, turanose, xylose, and glycerol.

It normally weakly produces acid anaerobically from glucose.|$|E
5000|$|According to Baumann, [...] "Botanical {{compounds}} {{for which}} dermatologic and cosmetic applications have emerged include: olive oil, chamomile, colloidal oatmeal, oat kernel extract, feverfew, acai berry, coffee berry, curcumin, green tea, pomegranate, licorice, paper mulberry, <b>arbutin,</b> and soy. [...] "Many of these botanical sources offer biologically active components that require further in vitro and in vivo investigation".|$|E
50|$|Bearberry extract {{is used in}} skin {{lightening}} treatments {{designed for}} long term and regular use. An active agent in brands of skin lightening preparations, it is more expensive than traditional skin lightening ingredients like hydroquinone, which is now banned in many countries. In vitro studies of human melanocytes exposed to <b>arbutin</b> at concentrations below 300 μg/mL reported decreased tyrosinase activity and melanin content with little evidence of cytotoxicity.|$|E

50|$|For skin {{whitening}} cosmetics {{for use by}} the public, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare {{has recognized}} a combination of active ingredients. These are mainly <b>arbutin</b> and kojic acid. Other ingredients include Vitamin C derivatives, tranexamic acid and ten-odd other types. Many of these active ingredients work through inhibiting catechol oxidase. Some types of BB cream, VIORIS products are also said to have skin whitening effects which contributes to the popularity of the cream in Asian markets.|$|E
50|$|According to Alaback et al., Kalmia polifolia {{contains}} a grayanotoxin, which when ingested lowers blood pressure, and may cause respiratory problems, dizziness, vomiting, or diarrhea. According to Lewis and Elvin-Lewis, the active compounds within Kalmia polifolia include andromedotoxin and <b>arbutin.</b> These compounds cause a slowing of pulse, a lowering of blood pressure, progressive paralysis and death. Kalmia polifolia has poisoned cattle, goats and sheep. For poisoning to occur, the animal must consume 0.3% {{of its body}} weight, while a dosage of 2% of an would cause severe sickness.|$|E
5000|$|Colloidal oatmeal may be {{beneficial}} in psoriasis. Aloe vera may help in atopic dermatitis. In both these conditions, the benefit may arise from anti-inflammatory properties. [...] "For combating acne and rosacea, green tea, niacinamide and feverfew are considered efficacious. For hyperpigmentation and antioxidative capabilities, licorice, green tea, <b>arbutin,</b> soy, acai berry, turmeric and pomegranate are among those plants and compounds found to be most beneficial. Additional {{research is needed to}} determine to confirm and elucidate the benefits of these ingredients in the prevention and management of skin disease." ...|$|E
50|$|No {{conclusive}} {{studies have}} been carried out on the chemical substances present in this broad family. The genera Protea and Faurea are unusual as they use xylose as the main sugar in their nectar and as they have high concentrations of polygalactol, while sucrose is the main sugar present in Grevillea. Cyanogenic glycosides, derived from tyrosine, are often present, as are proanthocyanidines (delphinidin and cyanidin), flavonols (kaempferol, quercetin and myricetin) and <b>arbutin.</b> Alkaloids are usually absent. Iridoids and ellagic acid are also absent. Saponins and sapogenins can be either present or absent in different species. Many species accumulate aluminium.|$|E
50|$|Mountain laurel is {{poisonous}} {{to several}} different animals, including horses, goats, cattle, deer, monkeys, and humans, due to grayanotoxin and <b>arbutin.</b> The green {{parts of the}} plant, flowers, twigs, and pollen are all toxic, including food products made from them, such as toxic honey that may produce neurotoxic and gastrointestinal symptoms in humans eating more than a modest amount. Fortunately the honey is sufficiently bitter to discourage most people from eating it, whereas it does not harm bees sufficiently to prevent its use as winter bee fodder. Symptoms of toxicity begin to appear about 6 hours following ingestion. Symptoms include irregular or difficulty breathing, anorexia, repeated swallowing, profuse salivation, watering of the eyes and nose, cardiac distress, incoordination, depression, vomiting, frequent defecation, weakness, convulsions, paralysis, coma, and eventually death. Necropsy of animals who have died from spoonwood poisoning show gastrointestinal hemorrhage.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe glycosylated {{hydroquinone}} <b>arbutin</b> (4 -hydroxyphenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside) {{is abundant}} in certain resurrection plants, which can survive almost complete dehydration for prolonged periods. Little {{is known about}} the role of <b>arbutin</b> in vivo, but it is thought to contribute toward survival of the plants in the dry state. We have investigated the interactions of <b>arbutin</b> with model membranes under conditions of high and low hydration, as well as the possible participation of <b>arbutin</b> in carbohydrate glasses formed at low water contents. Retention of a trapped soluble marker inside large unilamellar vesicles and fusion of vesicles was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. Effects of <b>arbutin</b> on glass-transition temperatures and hydrated membrane phase-transition temperatures were measured by differential scanning calorimetry. The possible insertion of <b>arbutin</b> into membrane bilayers was estimated by following <b>arbutin</b> auto-fluorescence. Evidence is presented that <b>arbutin</b> does not change the glass-transition temperature of a sucrose/trehalose glass, but that <b>arbutin</b> does interact with hydrated membranes by insertion of the phenol moiety into the lipid bilayer. This interaction causes increased membrane leakage during air-drying by a mechanism other than vesicle–vesicle fusion. Implications of these effects on the dehydrated plant cells, as well as possible methods of obviating the damage, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Arbutin</b> has antioxidative {{properties}} {{with potential}} benefits in many diseases. In this study, the cytoprotective and antioxidant effects of <b>arbutin</b> against t-BPH induced oxidative stress in Hep G 2 cells were 5 evaluated. HepG 2 {{cells were cultured in}} 24 -well plates (2. 5 × 10 cells in 1 ml RPMI- 1640 + 10 % FBS+ 1 % Pen. Strep). <b>Arbutin</b> at different concentrations (0, 50, 100 and 150 µM) were added into the wells. After 24 h exposure to <b>arbutin,</b> t-BHP at different concentrations (0, 100, 150, 200 and 250 µM) were added. Viability was measured (t = 72 h) using MTT assay and TB test. Furthermore, the antioxidant effect of <b>arbutin</b> was evaluated by FRAP assay. <b>Arbutin</b> significantly increased the total antioxidative power and antagonized the t-BHP oxidative effects. The cytotoxicity of t-BHP was significantly reduced by <b>arbutin</b> pretreatment. In the TB test and MTT assay, {{there was a}} significant difference between cell viability of group containing <b>arbutin</b> and t-BHP with group containing only t-BHP in a dose-dependent manner. <b>Arbutin</b> increased the total antioxidative power and it had cytoprotective effect. Increasing of cell viability might be an explanation to these effects...|$|E

40|$|<b>Arbutin</b> (p-hydroxyphenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside), a {{well-known}} tyrosinase inhibitor, {{has been widely}} used as a cosmetic whitening agent. Although its natural role is to scavenge free radicals within cells, it has also exhibited useful activities {{for the treatment of}} diuresis, bacterial infections and cancer, as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-tussive activities. Because function of free radical scavenging is also related to antioxidant and the effects of <b>arbutin</b> on longevity and stress resistance in animals have not yet been confirmed, here the effects of <b>arbutin</b> on Caenorhabditis elegans were investigated. The results demonstrated that optimal concentrations of <b>arbutin</b> could extend lifespan and enhance resistance to oxidative stress. The underlying molecular mechanism for these effects involves decreased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), improvement of daf- 16 nuclear localization, and up-regulated expression of daf- 16 and its downstream targets, including sod- 3 and hsp 16. 2. In this work the roles of <b>arbutin</b> in lifespan and health are studied and the results support that <b>arbutin</b> is an antioxidant for maintaining overall health...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} ability of {{radiofrequency}} (RF) microporation to promote trans-epidermal delivery of <b>arbutin.</b> Methods: To investigate the enhancing effect of RF microchannels on skin permeation of <b>arbutin,</b> in vitro skin permeability studies were performed with RF microporation-treated Hartley albino guinea pig skin using Franz diffusion cell system. Furthermore, improved depigmentation effects in brown guinea pig in vivo after treatment with RF microporation was evaluated to create hydrophilic microchannels for <b>arbutin</b> trans-epidermal delivery. Results: RF microporator caused disruption of the stratum corneum (SC) and created 50 μm diameter microchannels {{at a depth of}} 100 μm in the skin. RF microporation increased skin permeability of <b>arbutin</b> 2. 25 -fold compared to untreated skin exposed to RF in vitro. <b>Arbutin</b> administration led to considerable skin depigmentation following RF microporation of UV-induced hyperpigmented skin in a 28 -day in vivo experiment (ΔL-value on day 28 : UV, 0. 17 ± 0. 50; UV + RF, 0. 07 ± 0. 48; UV + <b>arbutin,</b> 1. 32 ± 0. 51 and UV + RF + <b>arbutin,</b> 1. 82 ± 0. 53).
