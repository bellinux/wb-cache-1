5|$|Despite the denunciations {{from the}} anarchist {{organizations}} and periodicals around the world, opinion {{began to change}} in 1976, when Sam Dolgoff published his book The Cuban Revolution: A Critical Perspective. As well, in 1979, the MLCE began publishing a new magazine titled Guángara Libertaria, reprinting Alfredo Gómez' article The Cuban Anarchists, or the Bad Conscience of Anarchism. In 1980, the MLCE and Guángara Libertaria supported the mass evacuation of Cubans from Cuba after many Cuban dissidents occupied the Peruvian embassy in Havana. Many of those who left Cuba at this time joined the editorial collective of Guángara. By 1985, the collective had correspondents around the world, including Mexico, Hawaii, Spain, and Venezuela. The magazine reached a press run of 5000 copies in 1987, making it the largest circulation anarchist periodical in the U.S. However, in 1992, the collective ceased publication of GL, though many of its members continued to publish writings. By 2008, the MLCE was structured as an <b>affinity</b> <b>group</b> and coordinating network for Cuban anarchists of diverse tendencies.|$|E

50|$|By definition, <b>Affinity</b> <b>groups</b> are {{autonomous}} {{from any}} larger body. Co-ordinated effort and co-operation amongst several <b>Affinity</b> <b>groups,</b> however, is often achieved {{by using a}} loose form of confederation. Private clubs, for example, may cooperate through reciprocal agreements which allow the members of one club to use the facilities of another club in a different location. Other <b>affinity</b> <b>groups,</b> such as Rotarians or Toastmasters, may be individual units that conform to shared standards so that one may participate in another group {{of the same name}} anywhere on earth without requiring the individual to reapply for a new membership.|$|R
25|$|Insurrectionary anarchism is {{a revolutionary}} theory, {{practice}} and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes {{the theme of}} insurrection within anarchist practice. It opposes formal organizations such as labor unions and federations {{that are based on}} a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists support informal organization and small <b>affinity</b> <b>group</b> based organization. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent class conflict, and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.|$|E
25|$|As the {{charterer}} {{was responsible}} for paying for the aircraft's entire capacity regardless of whether all seats were filled, {{there was a great}} temptation to let people, who were not eligible to travel under the <b>affinity</b> <b>group</b> rules, take the seats of other, eligible travellers who had cancelled their bookings. As a result, there were numerous occasions on which the airlines got into trouble with the authorities {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. This made the system increasingly unworkable.|$|E
25|$|To {{comply with}} IATA's {{arbitrary}} transatlantic charter rules, Caledonian and other independent charter operators insisted {{that anyone who}} wanted a cheap transatlantic charter flight needed to be a bona fide member of an <b>affinity</b> <b>group,</b> and that the prospective traveller needed {{to be a member}} of such an organisation for a minimum period of six months. As a result, clubs and associations with names like Friends of Clan Albion, Anglo-Scottish-American Group, Anglo-American Families Association, Rose and Maple Amity Club, Paisley Buddies, British American Club, Canadian US Pacific Association etc. sprang up on both sides of the Atlantic.|$|E

50|$|<b>Affinity</b> <b>groups</b> {{fall under}} the {{category}} of NGOs, but are further limited by being primarily non-commercial, and are not required to have any specific purpose that might affect the community beyond their own group. For example, both a social justice group and a philately group would be considered <b>affinity</b> <b>groups,</b> but the former more closely resembles the classic definition of an NGO.|$|R
25|$|In 1968, the BUA {{group of}} {{companies}} underwent a major reorganisation to improve its financial performance. This included adoption of a new strategy for BUA that aimed to replace the dwindling number of unprofitable trooping flights with growing engagement in the more rewarding European inclusive tour (IT) and transatlantic <b>affinity</b> <b>group</b> charter markets. It also resulted in relocation of the head office and concentration of engineering activities at Gatwick. Successful implementation of these organisational and strategic changes enabled BUA to make the loss-making South American routes profitable by late-1968 and to become the UK's only profitable mainline scheduled domestic operator by 1969.|$|E
25|$|The final {{identity}} perspective Gee identifies is the “affinity perspective (or A-identities)” (p.105). A-identities {{are built}} by shared experiences {{as part of}} an <b>affinity</b> <b>group,</b> which according to Gee’s definition is a group that share “allegiance to, access to, and participation in specific practices” (p.105). Joining these groups must be something the person has chosen to do and feels a part of in order for the A-identity to be built. Gee explains this further by stating, “While I could force someone to engage in specific practices, I really cannot coerce anyone into seeing the particular experiences connected to those practices as constitutive (in part) of the ‘kind of person’ they are” (p.106).|$|E
25|$|Lloyd International Airways Ltd was a private, British {{independent}} airline {{formed in}} 1961 to operate worldwide charter flights. It commenced operations {{with a single}} Douglas DC-4 piston airliner from Cambridge Marshall Airport. Lloyd International concentrated on passenger and cargo charters with four-engined, long-range aircraft. It also had links in Hong Kong since its inception and flew to the Far East regularly. During the mid-1960s, the airline began re-equipping its fleet with Bristol Britannia and Canadair CL-44 turboprops, all of which featured large cargo doors and palletised freight systems. Long-range Boeing 707 jets joined the Lloyd International fleet during the early 1970s for use on <b>affinity</b> <b>group</b> passenger and freight charters to North America and the Far East. Lloyd International ceased operations in June 1972.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the two former British Eagle One-Eleven 300s Dan-Air acquired from Kuwait Finance to complement the ex-American pair of 400 series {{as well as two}} former BOAC Comet 4s that were fully employed on the Lunn-Poly/Everyman charters, the other jet aircraft the failed carrier had operated/ordered found new homes relatively quickly. In early 1969, Laker Airways leased the former Qantas Boeing 707-138Bs from Kleinwort Benson for Bermudan $8,500 a month to replace Britannias on a new series of transatlantic <b>affinity</b> <b>group</b> charter flights. Two years later, Laker Airways also acquired a One-Eleven 300 from Bahamas Airways that had originally been delivered to British Eagle. BOAC purchased for £4 million the 707-365C British Eagle had leased from Kleinwort Benson (subsequently subleased to MEA). Caledonian acquired the 707-365C that had originally been ordered by British Eagle and delivered to Airlift International in February 1967.|$|E

One can be organized around a shared goal (e.g. blockading a particular road), a common ideology (e.g. the Quakers) or a place of origin.|$|R
2500|$|The {{design of}} the credit card itself {{has become a major}} selling point in recent years. The value of the card to the issuer is often related to the customer's usage of the card, or to the customer's {{financial}} worth. This has led to the rise of Co-Brand and Affinity cards, where the card design is related to the [...] "affinity" [...] (a university or professional society, for example) leading to higher card usage.

2500|$|DIVA-TV, {{an acronym}} for “Damned Interfering Video Activist Television," [...] was an <b>affinity</b> <b>group</b> within ACT UP that videotaped and {{documented}} AIDS activism. Its founding members are Catherine Gund, Ray Navarro, Ellen Spiro, Gregg Bordowitz, Robert Beck, Costa Pappas, Jean Carlomusto, Rob Kurilla, George Plagianos. One of their early works is “Like a Prayer” (1991), documenting the 1989 ACT UP protests at St. Patrick's Cathedral against New York Cardinal O'Connor’s position on AIDS and contraception. In the video, Ray Navarro, an ACT UP/DIVA TV activist, serves as the narrator, dressed up as Jesus. The documentary aims to show mass media bias as it juxtaposes original protest footage with those images shown on the nightly news.|$|E
2500|$|Thereafter, {{the number}} of neuroethics meetings, symposia and {{publications}} continued to grow. [...] The over 38 000 members of the Society for Neuroscience {{recognized the importance of}} neuroethics by inaugurating an annual [...] "special lecture" [...] on the topic, first given by Donald Kennedy, editor-in-chief of Science Magazine. [...] Several overlapping networks of scientists and scholars began to coalesce around neuroethics-related projects and themes. [...] For example, the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities established a Neuroethics <b>Affinity</b> <b>Group,</b> students at the London School of Economics established the Neuroscience and Society Network linking scholars from several different institutions, and a group of scientists and funders from around the world began discussing ways to support international collaboration in neuroethics through what came to be called the International Neuroethics Network.

2500|$|On 20 May 1963, the US Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) granted Caledonian {{a foreign}} [...] carrier permit for {{a three-year period}} under Section 402 of the US Federal Aviation Act. It became {{effective}} on 17 June 1963 when it was signed by President John F. Kennedy, making Caledonian the first overseas charter carrier to obtain this permit. The so-called Caledonian Case established a precedent and constituted the legal basis for all airlines that {{had always wanted to}} operate charters to and from the US and Canada, but had been unable to overcome the objections of the established airlines, such as Pan Am and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), prior to the enactment of this law. Caledonian's US breakthrough led to it being granted Canadian <b>affinity</b> <b>group</b> charter permission as well.
