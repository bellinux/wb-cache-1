25|$|A major {{question}} {{considered in}} mathematical Platonism is: Precisely {{where and how}} do the mathematical entities exist, {{and how do we}} know <b>about</b> <b>them?</b> <b>Is</b> there a world, completely separate from our physical one, that is occupied by the mathematical entities? How can we gain access to this separate world and discover truths about the entities? One proposed answer is the Ultimate Ensemble, a theory that postulates that all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically in their own universe.|$|E

25|$|Khand (Evil) – Tolkien wrote {{even less}} about Khand {{than he did}} about Harad, though {{we know that the}} only thing implied <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> that the armor they wore covered - {{literally}} - their entire bodies ("Variags who hated the sun"), and that their weapons may be their own design of Haradrim and Easterling weapons. Games Workshop has based their Variags of Khand on the Mongols and the Japanese, featuring sashimonos and the unique chariots, despite the Easterlings being the only culture in Middle-earth with chariots in Tolkien's writings. It was suggested that the Gondorians were unaware of the lands further east, and thus the names of the Variags and Wainriders had been mixed-up. Khand allies with the Easterlings (and the Haradrim) frequently.|$|E

The director of the film, D. J. Caruso, praised the duo saying that [...] "What's unusually cool <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> that they have maintained the producer-writer power that they earned in television and carried that over into the feature film area, and that is extremely rare." [...] Following their work on Eagle Eye, they were executive producers on the Sandra Bullock film, The Proposal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{large amount}} of {{personal}} information {{is available on the}} web about any individual. S uch information could be used to make vital decisions <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> S o it is important to protect the privacy of individuals when searches <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> executed in the web. Even though some data may be seemingly harmless, they could be potentially abused by other people. The problem is that although people know that searches <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> possible in the web, the do not have any means of controlling the usage of their data on the web by others. If users are given provisions to control how the data <b>about</b> <b>them</b> will <b>be</b> displayed in web searches <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> this problem can be avoided to some extent. In this paper, some of the different techniques for preserving the privacy of an individual at least to a certain extent when searches <b>about</b> <b>them</b> occur in the web are discussed and their performances are compared...|$|R

What would these good people think of a United States school history that took the same liberties with facts that some of our nature writers do: that, for instance, made Washington take his army over the Delaware in balloons, or in sleighs on the solid ice with bands playing; or that made Lincoln a victim of the Evil Eye; or that portrayed his slayer as a self-sacrificing hero; or that represented the little Monitor that eventful day on Hampton Roads as diving under the Merrimac and tossing it ashore on its beak? ...|$|E

2500|$|PBI {{can be used}} {{to enhance}} the {{contrast}} of an absorption image, in this case the phase information in the image plane is lost but contributes to the image intensity (edge enhancement of attenuation image). However it is also possible to separate the phase and the attenuation contrast, i.e. [...] to reconstruct the distribution of the real and imaginary part of the refractive index separately. The unambiguous determination of the phase of the wave front (phase retrieval) can be realized by recording several images at different detector-sample distances and using algorithms based on the linearization of the Fresnel diffraction integral to reconstruct the phase distribution, but this approach suffers from amplified noise for low spatial frequencies and thus slowly varying components may not be accurately recovered. [...] There are several more approaches for phase retrieval and a good overview <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> given in.|$|E

Favreau said on the band, [...] "What’s fun <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> they were the full-on real deal of heavy metal when I was in high school. They were as real deal as it got.

And now these days they put on the same show...and there’s {{a sense of humor}} about the whole thing....there’s even a strange gentleness to the music to me now, even though {{at the time it was}} as edgy as you get. It’s celebrating immaturity and youth" [...] in a similar way to the character of Tony Stark. In January 2010, Marvel announced that AC/DC's music would be featured heavily in Iron Man 2 in a collaboration with Columbia Records, who released a soundtrack album for the film featuring 15 classic AC/DC songs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tension between}} {{traditional}} models of masculinity and the experiences within the war runs throughout the novel. Critic Greg Harris identifies Regeneration, {{along with the}} other two novels in the trilogy, as profiling the non-fictional experience of Sassoon and other soldiers who must deal with ideas of masculnity. These characters feel conflicted by a model of masculinity common to Britain during this time: [...] honour, bravery, mental strength, and confidence were privileged [...] "manly" [...] characteristics. Yet they explore, internally and through conversation, what that model means for them and how the war changes how they should experience it. In an interview with Barker in Contemporary Literature, Rob Nixon distinguishes between these ideas of [...] "manliness" [...] and the concept of masculinity as providing a larger definition for identity. Barker agrees with his assessment, saying, [...] "and what's so nice <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> that they use it so unself-consciously: they must have been the last generation of men who could talk about manliness without going [...] "ugh" [...] inside." ...|$|E

[...] The album incorporates themes involving both personal and political conflict, and Morissette explained that [...] "Our emotions align themselves with larger symptomatic things in the world. We face a large war out there, but [...] more closely reflects the war in people's living rooms... the icy silence at home, versus the big cold war." [...] Morissette summarized the track [...] "Moratorium" [...] as being [...] "essentially a song about my readiness to stop repeating bad patterns. I've kicked some of those in my life." [...] She said of [...] "Not as We", [...] "You know how you can resist hitting rock bottom for a long time? That song just goes 'OK, I'm going. All the way down'".
