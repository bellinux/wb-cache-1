5|$|Pros had the Buffalo All-Americans {{as their}} next opponent. The All-Americans were tired from their 7 to 3 {{victory against the}} Canton Bulldogs the day before. Before {{the start of the}} game, Nash was sold to the All-Americans for $300 and 5% of the Akron-Buffalo gate, making the first deal in APFA history. The reason for the trade was because rain caused a low number of fans. However, Nash did not appear in the game for either team, and Scotty Bierce {{replaced}} Nash for the Pros. The rain caused sloppy game play as well as <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> of 3,000 people. It resulted in a 0–0 tie.|$|E
5|$|The All-Americans had the Akron Pros {{as their}} next opponent. The All-Americans were tired from their {{victory against the}} Canton Bulldogs the day before. Before {{the start of the}} game, Bob Nash of Akron was sold to the All-Americans for $300 and 5% of the Akron-Buffalo gate, making the first deal in APFA history. The reason for the trade was because rain caused a low amount of fans, and the game would not have been {{profitable}} for the Pros. However, Nash did not appear in the game for either team, and Scotty Bierce replaced Nash for the Pros. The rain caused sloppy game play as well as <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> of 3,000 people. The All-Americans had an opportunity to score in the final minutes of the game. Fritz Pollard fumbled the ball, and Heinie Miller recovered it. Buffalo had the ball on the 12-yard-line, but the officials called the end of the game. It resulted in a 0–0 tie.|$|E

50|$|The {{event was}} aired {{the same time}} Floyd Mayweather fought Juan Manuel Márquez. Maywather/Márquez drew <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>crowd</b> (13,116) but its gate was {{considerably}} higher at $6,811,300. It also sold more PPV buys (1,000,000).|$|R
50|$|Orcuttia viscida is <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> hairy, {{aromatic}} annual grass forming sticky, glandular tufts up to 10 or 15 centimeters in maximum height. The inflorescence is <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> <b>crowded</b> {{cluster of}} spikelets with awned tips that curve outward at maturity, giving the spikes a bristly appearance.|$|R
50|$|Playing to <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>crowd</b> than {{expected}} due to lower ticket sales perhaps {{due in part}} to Snow Patrol performing two last minute shows in Manchester three weeks prior to the event and withholding permission to use the band's name for promotional purposes, until their own shows had been completed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Crowding {{occurs when}} the {{perception}} of a supra-threshold target is impaired by nearby distractors, reflecting a fundamental limitation on visual spatial resolution. It is likely that crowding limits music reading, as each musical note is crowded by adjacent notes and by the five-line staff, similar to word reading, in which letter recognition is reduced by crowding from adjacent letters. Here, we tested the hypoth-esis that, with extensive experience, music-reading experts have acquired visual skills such that they experience <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>crowding</b> effect, resulting in higher music-reading fluency. Experts experienced <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>crowding</b> effect than did novices, but only for musical stimuli, not for control stimuli (Landolt Cs). The magnitude of the crowding effect for musical stimuli could be predicted by individual fluency in music reading. Our results highlight the role of experience in crowding: Visual spatial resolution can be improved specifically for objects associated with perceptual expertise. Music-reading rates are likely limited by crowding, and our {{results are consistent with}} the idea that experience alleviates these limitations...|$|R

25|$|On Sunday morning, California police, {{who have}} been {{tracking}} Kowalski's movements on an electronic wall-map, set up a roadblock with two bulldozers {{in the small town}} of Cisco, where Kowalski will be passing. <b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> gathers at the roadblock. As Kowalski approaches at high speed, he smiles as he crashes into the bulldozers in a fiery explosion. As firemen work to put out the flames, the crowd slowly disperses.|$|E
25|$|On 26 January, {{several hundred}} loyalists held a protest outside Belfast City Hall, {{and a number}} of protesters later blocked several roads in East Belfast. A man was later arrested and charged with assaulting police, disorderly behaviour, obstructing traffic and {{resisting}} arrest. First Minister Peter Robinson attended a meeting with loyalist leaders as well as local church and community representatives at the Skainos Centre in East Belfast. When leaving, he was heckled by <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> of loyalists and his car was struck by a flag pole.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} public discussions {{took place in}} 2009 and 2010, {{beginning}} with his first introduction of the project on February 25, 2009. Held at the historic Madame Walker Theatre in the Indiana Avenue district in Indianapolis, Wilson discussed his prior work and unveiled the digital rendering for E Pluribus Unum to <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> of local students and community members. The following year Wilson returned to Indianapolis for further public outreach, including an event in April 2010 at Crispus Attucks High School and in August at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.|$|E
50|$|The third Ragstock was <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> {{affair in}} the Courtyard Garden of Anurag Bhalla. The {{key element of}} the event was still {{at the heart of}} Ragstock - live, {{acoustic}} music. This year, solo artists including Chris Naunton's Mandolin played to <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>crowd.</b> Each ticket cost £20 which included free drinks and food all night. With over 150 people attending, raising over £3,000 for the Royal Marsden, the overall total for the first three Ragstock events reached almost £10,000.|$|R
5000|$|Those Awful Hats is a 1909 American short comedy film {{directed}} by D.W. Griffith. It {{takes place in}} <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> <b>crowded</b> movie theatre, where the patrons are perpetually distracted by people - primarily women - wearing large, ostentatious hats that obstruct everyone else's views of the screen. The film ends with a title card reading, [...] "Ladies Will Please Remove Their Hats." [...] A print of the film survives in the film archive of the Library of Congress.|$|R
50|$|Nipomo Mesa lupine is <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> {{spreading}} annual herb with a stem reaching 10 to 20 centimeters in length. Each {{palmate leaf}} {{is made up}} of 5 to 7 narrow, succulent leaflets between 1 and 1.5 centimeters long and just a few millimeters wide. The herbage is hairy in texture. The inflorescence is <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> <b>crowded</b> raceme of flowers each 6 to 7 millimeters long. The flower is pink with a lighter, sometimes yellowish spot on its banner. The fruit is a legume pod up to 2 centimeters long.|$|R
25|$|As <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> {{gathered}} around Zerai, an Italian military officer tried to interrupt his devotions. Zerai {{pulled out a}} scimitar, struck the officer, and shouted imprecations against Italy and the Duce, while praising the Negus (Ethiopian monarch). During the confrontation, Zerai injured Italian Railways private Vincenzo Veglia, State employee Ferdinando Peraldi, and Infantry Chief Marshal Mario Izzo, who reported very slight wounds that healed within 12 days. According to other reports, some passersby, including a butcher's boy who hurled his bicycle at the Eritrean,) were also injured.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{official}} announcement, crowds gathered spontaneously to celebrate outside the White House, where thousands assembled. Hundreds of New Yorkers also gathered in Times Square and at Ground Zero, {{the site of}} the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In Dearborn, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit with a large Muslim and Arab population, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> gathered outside the City Hall in celebration, many of them of Middle Eastern descent. From the beginning to the end of Obama's speech, 4,000 tweets per second were sent on Twitter.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, renovations {{within the church}} were carried out. The flight of stairs {{leading up to the}} Main Entrance was {{replaced}} by a new staircase with an extension built to house a youth room and an auditorium. A mural painting of Jesus preaching to <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> with the Lake Galilee in the background adorns the inner wall of the extension. To reduce renovation cost and time, layering of new floor tiles over existing ones was carried out. Small stained glass windows depicting the Passion of the Lord replaced the previous orange lanterns with illustrations of the scenes of the Passion. The old seating benches gave way to sturdy new ones, while the use of hymn books and bible leaflets were discontinued with the use of projectors and television screens displaying liturgical prayers, bible readings, hymns and announcements during mass. The church opened the new extension for viewing to the parishioners in November 2003.|$|E
50|$|The fair drew <b>a</b> much <b>smaller</b> <b>crowd</b> than {{anticipated}} (about 10 million people). It ended up unable to cover its debts and was placed into receivership in 1927, {{at which point}} its assets were sold at auction.|$|R
50|$|Bad {{weather and}} the delay in his arrival drew <b>a</b> disappointingly <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> for this jump, so Patch {{announced}} he would repeat the feat a second time October 17. A few days later, 10,000 gathered to watch him keep his word.|$|R
50|$|Dane Cook {{continued}} {{to be one of}} the label’s biggest names during this time, with his 2007 release, “Rough Around The Edges: Live From Madison Square Garden” debuting at #11 on US Charts and selling 90,000 copies in its first week. Two years later, the label released “Dane Cook: Isolated Incident,” with Cook opting to tape this album in front of <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>crowd</b> of 400 at The Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. Dane Cook’s greatest hits album “I Did My Best,” was released on the label in 2010.|$|R
25|$|News of Jackson's death {{triggered}} {{an outpouring}} of grief around the world. The circumstances and timing of his death were compared to those of Elvis Presley and John Lennon. Fans gathered outside the UCLA Medical Center, Neverland Ranch, his Holmby Hills home, the Hayvenhurst Jackson family home in Encino, the Apollo Theater in New York, and at Hitsville U.S.A., the old Motown headquarters in Detroit where Jackson's career began, now the Motown Museum. Streets around the hospital were blocked off, and across America people left offices and factories to watch the breaking news on television. <b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>crowd,</b> including the city's mayor, gathered outside his childhood home in Gary, where the flag on city hall was flown at half staff in his honor. Fans in Hollywood initially gathered around the Walk of Fame star of another Michael Jackson—unable to access the singer's star, which had been temporarily covered by equipment {{in place for the}} Brüno film premiere. Grieving fans and memorial tributes relocated from the talk radio host's star the next day.|$|E
25|$|In {{front of}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>crowd,</b> a strong Birmingham side, with Žigić as lone striker, {{attacked}} Braga from the start. An early handball appeal was turned down, but after ten minutes, Ewerton pulled down Elliott as he {{cut into the}} penalty area. Žigić took the penalty, but Quim had no difficulty saving. Soon afterwards, Ewerton fouled Burke {{on the edge of}} the area, but the referee failed to award what would have been a second yellow card. Early in the second half, Hugo Viana's shot from distance was going wide of Myhill's right-hand post but took a huge deflection off Curtis Davies to leave Myhill stranded and the ball in the other corner of his net. Birmingham brought on King and Wood, but to no avail. Both teams had chances near the end: Burke and King obstructed each other, and when Lima was clean through, Myhill parried his shot straight to Paulo César who hit the ball over the top. The result saw Braga qualify, and combined with Brugge's win in Maribor, who came back from 3–0 down to score four times in the last quarter-hour, left Birmingham needing to beat Maribor in the last group game and hope that Braga beat Brugge.|$|E
500|$|In June 2010 {{the band}} were commemorated with a Heritage Award by PRS for Music. A plaque was erected on the Duke of York pub in Belfast where the band {{performed}} their first gig. The band {{was only the}} sixth to receive the award along {{with the likes of}} Blur and Elton John. With all the members turning out, they later performed a live set to <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> of around 30 people. Quinn described the award as an [...] "honour", and said the plaque meant more to him than other awards that they have received along the way.|$|E
50|$|In March 2006, the Commonwealth Games Queen's Baton Relay {{travelled}} to the area, where a re-enactment of the {{handing over}} of The Ashes to the British {{took place in}} front of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> local <b>crowd.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Czech Republic {{have played}} seven full {{international}} matches at Andrův stadion, {{the first one}} taking place in 1998.

50|$|The Gorgie ground {{has also}} hosted rugby league matches on four occasions. In 1911 a test match between England and Australia ended in an 11-11 draw. Eight decades later, {{the newly created}} Super League again {{attempted}} to promote the sport in Scotland, moving two league fixtures to Tynecastle. The 1998 meeting between London Broncos and Bradford Bulls drew over 7,000 fans, while the following year Gateshead Thunder met Wigan Warriors before <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>crowd.</b> In 2000, Tynecastle staged a sectional tie in the Rugby League World Cup between Scotland and Samoa, which the Samoans won 20-12.|$|R
500|$|In September, 2010, [...] "Count on Me" [...] was {{performed}} in front of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> of fans at the Waterloo Records in Austin, Texas. Mars sung live the song on September 27, 2010, during a MTV Push Live session held in the United Kingdom. Mars, who was the opening act in an episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show in December, 2012, performed the track {{as a tribute to}} the victims of the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. It was the ninth song of his debut worldwide tour, The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour (2010), and {{was performed}} only once during the Moonshine Jungle Tour (2013-2014) in Jakarta.|$|E
500|$|On February 27, 1775, HMS Lively {{brought a}} force of about 240 British regulars from the 64th Regiment under Colonel Alexander Leslie to {{confiscate}} weapons in Salem, Massachusetts. [...] They were stopped by <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> that raised a drawbridge in their path and taunted them while others moved the cannon to safety and sent for help from nearby towns. [...] Eventually, the drawbridge was lowered and the regulars were permitted to search the forge where the cannon had once been. They returned to their ship while being mocked by a growing force of irregulars marching along in lock-step next to them. [...] There were minor scuffles, but no shots were fired.|$|E
500|$|Baffert {{created some}} {{controversy}} {{prior to the}} Belmont by choosing to work the horse at Churchill Downs and ship late to Belmont Park without a timed workout at the New York track. While several prominent trainers questioned his decision, Baffert {{believed that it was}} more important to keep American Pharoah [...] "happy" [...] on a track he liked, having used a similar strategy with his 2001 Belmont Stakes winner, Point Given. Rival trainers Kiaran McLaughlin and D. Wayne Lukas backed Baffert's strategy, with McLaughlin making the remark, [...] "I don't think it matters for American Pharoah. He could probably run down a street over broken glass." [...] Appearing unperturbed but curious about <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> of well-wishers, American Pharoah arrived at Long Island MacArthur Airport on June 2, having traveled from Louisville, Kentucky on a customized Boeing 727 dubbed [...] "Air Horse One".|$|E
500|$|The team {{entered the}} Wharncliffe Charity Cup at the semi-final stage but were drawn against {{established}} cross-city rivals The Wednesday. [...] Despite increasing rivalry between the clubs, <b>a</b> relatively <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> {{of just over}} 3,000 spectators were present at Wednesday's Olive Grove ground to watch them beat United 2–1.|$|R
50|$|A running battle {{occurred}} {{throughout the}} night between National Guard troops and picketers in a six-block area surrounding the plant. <b>A</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>crowd</b> rushed the troops again a short time after Hubay and Cyigon's deaths, and two more picketers were injured by gunfire. A company of troops was sent to guard the Bingham Tool and Die plant, a squad of sheriff's deputies dispatched to protect the Logan Gear factory, and another 400 National Guardsmen ordered to the area. Nearly two dozen picketers and troopers were injured by hurled missiles during the night. The total number of troops now in Toledo was 1,350, the largest peace-time military build-up in Ohio history.|$|R
5000|$|A Facebook {{entitled}} [...] "March 2 Uprising for Dignity and Freedom" [...] {{called for}} further protests {{in all parts}} of Oman, beginning on 2 March, and it attracted more than 2,300 users. However, protests only occurred at the Globe Roundabout in Sohar with <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>crowd</b> of 50 protesters who blockaded the area. Some people had organised community policing groups to prevent more damage. The army also issued a red alert to vacate the area or threatened action. The 'Sohar Citizen Committee' as it is called has started giving out numbers of its core members to people who can call upon it {{in case of an emergency}} or riots attack.|$|R
