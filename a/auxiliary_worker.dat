40|$|Mixed Model Assembly Line is {{the general}} trend of the {{automobile}} industry in our country. The scheduling and sequencing problem is the key technology of the assembly line. Toyota (Japan) production system admits workers to stop the conveyor whenever they fail to finish the operation within their work station in a mixed model assembly line, so, the conveyor stoppage is an important subject in sequencing problem for mixed model assembly line in the Toyota production system. According to this subject, its object of the industrial organization policy is minimizing the total conveyor stoppage time. While in the mixed model assembly line of the United Stated, if the worker {{is not able to}} finish the work piece when he arrives the end position, he returns to the start station, leaving the unfinished work piece to be done by the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>worker.</b> In this situation, the object of the industry organization policy of the mixed model assembly line in the United States which is quite different from that of Japan is minimizing the unfinished work load. Studying on the industry theory of the United States, this paper aims at minimizing the utility time (the time used by the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>worker</b> for completing the unfinished work piece), idle time (the time used for the worker is kept for waiting for a work piece to enter the boundary of his allowable work area) and the cost of production under the conditions of different lengths of the assembly line. This paper also studies the relationship between the number of stations, different models of the work pieces needed to process and the time calculated by the computer. One of the results of this paper is when other conditions of the mixed model assembly line (for example, the number of work pieces, the number of stations, the kind of different work piece models, etc.) are settled, the idle time, utility time and the cost of the idle time, utility time are decreased with the increasing of the length of the line (within the length of 15 m and 22 m). This paper uses the algorithm of Branch and Bound for finding the optimal sequencing of the assembly line. Results show that the algorithm of Brunch and Bound is a useful method for finding the optimal results, but it is not suitable for large scale and complicated assembly lines. So, for large scale mixed model assembly line with numerous of work stations and kinds of work pieces, new and more practiced algorithms for example Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA) are needed to be used...|$|E

40|$|South Africa {{bears the}} largest burden of {{children}} living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa, with 450 000 of the continent's over 3 million children living with HIV {{estimated to be}} in the country (UNAIDS, 2013 : 87). Children living with HIV have various intrinsic biopsychosocial needs, and the meeting of these needs within drop-in-centres is primarily the responsibility of Social <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Workers,</b> a ?frontline? category of social welfare workforce whose roles are viewed as critical in enabling the identification and facilitation of provision of health and other services. The study was informed by a concern that, in spite of their envisaged roles, Social <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Workers</b> have very limited paediatric HIV knowledge, skills and experience. The goal {{of the study was to}} explore the perceptions of Social <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Workers</b> on their role and competencies in addressing biopsychosocial needs of children living with HIV at drop-in-centres. The researcher conducted this study from a qualitative approach. The study was applied in a natural setting and a collective case study design was utilised. The work experiences of a purposive sample of participants that was randomly sampled were gathered by means of semi-structured one-on-one interviews. A total sample of 10 participants was drawn from a pool of 40 Social <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Workers</b> who were employed in 18 drop-in-centres that are in Sedibeng District Municipality. The study's findings indicate that children living with HIV had many complex biological, psychological and social needs that were exacerbated by stigma, discrimination and non-disclosure of the children's HIV status by parents. This created underlying debilitating barriers for Social <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Workers</b> to efficiently identify, and get children into treatment, care and social support services. The findings also revealed that Social <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Workers</b> had limited, non-standardised and highly imperceptible HIV knowledge and skills to competently work with children living with HIV. Furthermore, findings showed that Social <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Workers</b> face institutional and resource challenges that stem from poverty, insufficient financial resources within drop-in-centres and lack of structured large scale programmes to mobilise and educate communities on children and HIV. The study concluded that many of the biopsychosocial needs that children living with HIV face are not being comprehensively and sustainably addressed as Social <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Workers</b> are not effective in their role, amongst other things, due to lack of skills and knowledge on how to address factors that contribute to the exclusion; and consequently, disproportionate low access of services by children living with HIV. The study proposes the training and capacitation of Social <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Workers</b> on paediatric HIV so as to increase the depth and breadth of services rendered to children living with HIV. It is also important that regular and on-going supervision and debriefing opportunities for Social <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Workers</b> should be strengthened to promote optimal consolidation of skills and knowledge. The provision of simplified practice guidelines and procedures should also be prioritised in order to ensure consistency in understanding amongst Social <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Workers</b> of their role and obligations. Furthermore, it is recommended that Government and the Department of Social Development should consider scaling-up funding for drop-in-centres as well as implementation of HIV-related stigma and discrimination mitigation programmes in communities.

40|$|Magister Artium (Human Ecology) - MA(HE) A theory-based {{evaluation}} {{has been}} conducted with an improvement-orientated purpose on the Social <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Worker</b> (SAW) Training Programme for an accredited provider to improve and continue to implement their own SAW Training Programmes. Theory-driven evaluations are essential for distinguishing between the validity of programme implementation and the validity of programme theory. Addressing the social needs of communities through social development and transformation is a top priority for the South African Government. South Africa faces a shortage of Social Work Practitioners (SWPs) due to emigration, as well as insufficient numbers of university graduates. This shortage has left the current SWPs with severe workload pressures. The South African Department of Social Development (DSD) initiated, in 2004, the training of Social Auxiliary Workers (SAWs) to serve as assistants to the SWPs. The SAW qualification initiative has been developed as a course accredited with the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) at the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) level 4. Providers of SAW training courses are accredited by the Health and Welfare Sectoral Education and Training Authority (HWSETA) and by the South African Council for Social Services Professions (SACSSP). The empirical {{part of the study}} was conducted in two stages. The first stage consisted of a clarificatory evaluation, wherein a step-by-step logical participatory process was followed for the clarification and development of the programme theory. This process resulted in logic models and a theory-of-change model against which the evaluation questions for the study were developed. These questions assessed the need for the SAW training programme - and for the SAW training programme planning and design. It was found that there was a need for SAW training programmes and that the SAW training programme had been designed to address this need. The second stage consisted of an implementation evaluation. This was done by means of a data matrix using the evaluation aspects for each of the objectives developed during the clarificatory evaluation. Data gathering was done by means of content analysis, focus group workshops and questionnaires. Data interpretations, conclusions and judgements were made with regard to each of the objectives and consolidated in a table format which indicated the outputs and outcomes, implementation results- and a judgement and recommendation for each objective. It was found that a standardised and structured process was followed most of the time, but that the knowledge and skills training elements, particularly in their practical application, left room for improvement. The study illustrates the advantages of a theory-based evaluation that assists with programme planning and modification, knowledge development and the planning of evaluation studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose - This {{research}} {{extends the}} traditional cultural divide {{between male and}} female lawyers by examining contradictory workplace policies that discriminate against the work and education of female <b>auxiliary</b> <b>workers</b> within general legal practice in Australia. Design/Methodology/Approach - The study uses membership categorisation devices, an ethnomethodological approach, to analyse two policy statements which are in common use in Australian legal practice. Findings - The research finds that the statements, which are a merge of policy and procedures, are fundamentally contradictory. Whilst one prohibits and represses any discrimination against women, the other does not provide educational opportunities for employees, predominantly women, at the auxiliary level of employment. As a result female <b>auxiliary</b> <b>workers</b> are marginalised and their career prospects are diminished. Practical implications - Policies guiding work and education in Australian legal practice reinforce a culture of gender-based discrimination. It is argued that espoused policies need to reflect policies in action by providing career opportunities for women <b>auxiliary</b> <b>workers.</b> Originality/value - The research challenges the notion that espousing a policy of Equal Opportunity leads to women receiving the same educational opportunities as men in Australian legal practice. The research shows the importance of understanding how job category has cultural and gendered meanings. Griffith Business School, Department of MarketingNo Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore some of the {{practices}} of home economics teachers in the use of auxiliary personnel as expressed by city and state supervisors. A second purpose was to discover the beliefs of city and state supervisors regarding the use of auxiliary personnel in home economics programs. A questionnaire was designed and validated to determine these practices and beliefs. Two hundred fifty-nine questionnaires were sent to city and state supervisors. A total of 130 usable questionnaires were returned. The questions proposed for study were: 1. Do you have any auxiliary personnel in the city or state home economics program which you represent? 2. Who are the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>workers</b> being used in home economics classes in your program? 3. How did your program get started? 4. What are the aides doing? 5. What difference do aides make in the total home economics program? 6. What training do the aides have? 7. How are teachers prepared or trained to use aides ? 8. Do you have in your city or state job descriptions for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>workers</b> ? 9. Do you have in your city or state criteria for the hiring of aides ? 10. How do you feel about the concept of teacher aides ? It was assumed that when the results of these questions were tabulated, guidelines for the use of auxiliary personnel in home economics education programs could be developed. Findings Over half (59 percent) of the total number of respondents reported that they did not have <b>auxiliary</b> <b>workers</b> in their programs. Of those programs that did have <b>auxiliary</b> <b>workers</b> over 50 percent indicated that the workers were mostly community residents. Respondents with auxiliary programs indicated that the auxiliary personnel were generally paid and working part time. A little over one third of the programs were started as a result of teacher requests and federal funding. Five categories of activities for auxiliary duties were listed. They were: actual work with students; audio-visual aids; housekeeping; interpreting the program; and secretarial. The respondents were asked to designate how frequently each activity was carried out by the auxiliaries. Most of the programs had auxiliaries who frequently worked with students. Fifty-one percent of the programs had <b>auxiliary</b> <b>workers</b> trained in after school meetings. It could not be determined from the data how the training was conducted or to what extent. About one third of the programs had teachers trained through supervisor-teacher conferences. Again, it could not be determined how the training was conducted or to what extent. Important to note, however, is that nearly one third of the programs had teachers who had no training or preparation for working with aides. The supervisors were asked to indicate how they felt toward particular statements about teacher aide programs. They were given the following choices to indicate their degree of agreement: agreed; had no feeling one way or another; disagreed; undecided or wanted to qualify the statement. Over ninety percent of the respondents agreed that aides should understand how to work with children, that aides should have planning time together with their teachers, and that aides' assignments should grow out of the needs of a given teaching situation. There were three concepts where 50 percent or more of the supervisors disagreed. Those concepts were: it is not necessary for teachers to have training in working with aides; teaching responsibilities require many different levels of skills, all of these must be carried out by the same individual; aides can be a threat with regard to salary increases for the teacher. Supervisors were asked for statements as to what difference aides make in the total home economics program. Most of the responses were brief and in agreement with the literature. In general, they felt that teachers could concentrate more effectively on professional functions when aided. Respondents were also asked if they had job descriptions and criteria for the hiring of aides in their city or state. Although a few supervisors said that they were currently working on developing these items, most of them did not have such descriptions or criteria in their programs. Guidelines After the data were collected and analyzed guidelines for the use of auxiliary personnel in home economics education programs were developed. They were developed in two parts; guidelines for administrators and guidelines for home economics teachers. These guidelines encompass concepts pertaining to aspects of auxiliary personnel programs such as: scope, type of worker, aide training, aide placement, aide qualifications and standards, aide duties, teacher, and teacher training...|$|R

There were 31 assembling workers, 120 welders, 30 mechanic, 80 painters, 45 <b>auxiliary</b> <b>workers,</b> and 40 managerial workers. DNA damages were measured by the Comet assay. RESULTS: In painting workshops, benzene levels ranged from 0. 1 to 138. 5 mg/m 3, toluene from 0. 1 to 389. 6 mg/m 3, and xylene from 0. 1 to 11. 4 mg/m 3. In welding workshops, welding dust concentrations ranged from 1. 1 to 4. 4 mg/m 3 with manganese dioxide levels ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 11 mg/m 3. In lathe workshops, mixed dust concentrations ranged from 1. 1 to 2. 2 mg/m 3. Assembling workshops were clean and not measured. Gender {{had no effect on}} tail moment. Age was slightly correlated with tail moment (r= 0. 11, p= 0. 051). Significant differences of tail moment among the 6 job categories were found (p= 0. 003).

30|$|First, we find {{significant}} effects of occupational {{group on the}} probability of a job being a student job or a flexible job. Relative to the least skilled category of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>workers,</b> the probability of each is lower if a job vacancy appeared for positions in more skilled occupational categories. This effect, however, is smaller {{in the case of a}} dependent variable defined as student job. A job offer which belongs to the top management occupational group is 32 percentage points percentage points (pp) less likely to be based on flexible work contracts but only 11 pp less likely to be targeted directly at students. Similarly, a job offer advertised for a position placed in an administrative worker category is 22 pp less likely to be a flexible offer while only 5 pp less likely to be a student job offer. This can be interpreted as indicating that relative to flexible jobs, student jobs are less strongly concentrated in the least skilled occupational categories.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Smoking {{cessation}} {{support is}} increasingly delivered {{in primary care}} by <b>auxiliary</b> healthcare <b>workers</b> in place of healthcare professionals. However, it is unknown whether this shift might affect the quality and impact of the support delivered. Methods: Data from the iQuit in Practice randomized control trial of cessation support in General Practice was used (N = 602). Analyses assessed whether cessation advisor type (nurse or healthcare assistant [HCA]) was associated with abstinence (primary outcome: self-reported 2 -week point prevalence abstinence at 8 weeks follow-up), the advice delivered during the initial consultation, pharmacotherapies prescribed, patient satisfaction, initial consultation length, and the number and type of interim contacts. Results: There were {{no statistically significant differences}} in abstinence for support delivered by HCAs versus nurses at 8 weeks (HCAs 42. 8 %, nurses 42. 6 %; unadjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1. 01, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 73 to 1. 40), or at 4 weeks or 6 months follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences in advice delivered, the types of pharmacotherapies prescribed or patient satisfaction. Compared with nurses, HCA consultations were longer on average (HCAs 23. 6 minutes, nurses 20. 8 minutes; P =. 002) and they undertook more interim contacts (HCAs median 2, nurses median 1; P <. 001), with contact more likely to be face-to-face than phone call (HCAs 91. 2 %, nurses 70. 9 %; OR = 4. 23, 95 % CI = 2. 86 to 6. 26). Conclusions: HCAs appear equally effective as nurses in supporting smoking cessation, although they do this with greater patient contact. Using auxiliary practitioners to deliver cessation support could free up nurse time and reduce costs. Implications: This study found that primary care patients receiving smoking cessation support from <b>auxiliary</b> healthcare <b>workers</b> were just as likely to be abstinent up to 6 months later as those patients seen by nurses. While the <b>auxiliary</b> healthcare <b>workers</b> achieved this with slightly increased patient contact time, the advice delivered, pharmacotherapies provided and patient satisfaction were similar to that of nurses. Expanding the <b>auxiliary</b> healthcare <b>worker</b> role to include smoking cessation support could increase role satisfaction and reduce the costs of cessation support delivery in primary care...|$|R
50|$|The small {{health centers}} in many VDCs are without <b>Auxiliary</b> Health <b>Workers</b> (AHWs), <b>Auxiliary</b> Nurse Midwives (ANMs) and Community Health Workers (CHWs). So, people seeking {{emergency}} health assistance {{have to travel}} a long distance to the district headquarters or Kathmandu or end up dying {{because of lack of}} treatment. Many people still believe in Dhami and Jhakri and don't always seek medicine or go to the hospital for the treatment.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the four}} former mills in Glanbrücken, none is still running. Even into the 1960s, the {{agricultural}} structure was dominant, and farming was, {{but for the}} quarries and the few craft businesses, {{the only way to}} earn one’s livelihood in these twin villages. Many workers earned a living at mining, but this was outside Glanbrücken, in the Saarland. After the railway was built in 1904, the local economy quickly saw an upswing. The Steinbruch-Aktiengesellschaft Köln (a quarrying company from Cologne) located down from the railway station and built a stately administration building. At the Deimberger Bruch (the quarry), the sought-after sandstone was hewn from the ground and worked on site. For a while, the yield reached 3 200 m² yearly. Sixty quarrymen and 20 <b>auxiliary</b> <b>workers</b> worked at the quarry, which lay 3 km from the villages. Meanwhile, 120 stonemasons and 15 of their apprentices were kept busy at the workplace in Niedereisenbach. Today there are a few service-sector businesses, two inns, an automotive-electric business, a rooﬁng business and a building material dealership that also deals in land. The municipality of Glanbrücken has grown into a mostly commuter-oriented, residential community.|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} {{the thesis that}} nursing with its wide range of work in spheres of the management, teaching and prac¬ tice of nursing care relies for its maintenance and extension upon the stable contributions of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>workers.</b> <b>Auxiliaries</b> in the U. K. context are nursing workers without recognised qualification to nurse and who may {{have little or no}} formal training for their work. A secondary theme is argued that auxiliaries are inherently disadvantaged in the professional nursing structures. The disadvantage is due to a reified image of nursing which is unrelated to patients' needs and unrelated to the daily practice of nursing care. The reification of nursing and the resulting disadvantage to unqualified nursing workers render them less effective than their quantity and human potential should allow. Through the means of two national reviews of policies related to auxiliaries in general and psychiatric divisions of the N. H. 3., a wide variety of patterns of employment, instruction, and use were found; nursing managers also revealed a range of problems met in the employment of less-than-fully qualified workers in nursing systems. With this problem-oriented perspec¬ tive, the characteristics and work of auxiliaries in one English health district characterised by relatively low reliance upon these workers, are described. The health district, one of three districts serving as case studies for^he government health department—funded research, was examined by means of postal questionnaires, personal interviews, work diaries and observation of nursing activities. The study, endeavouring to contribute to the discussion of work levels in health care, and within this in nursing care of patients, provides base-line information upon which experimental research may be undertaken...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Systematic {{evaluation}} {{is an integral}} part of the organization and delivery of community oral health care programmes, ensuring the effectiveness of these community-based interventions. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and practice of primary health care (PHC) personnel regarding their duties toward oral health. Methods and Material. A cross-sectional study was carried out among three groups of PHC personnel in the city of Kerman (Iran). Volunteer personnel completed a piloted questionnaire which included demographic data, some question regarding their knowledge about oral health, their duties and also their practice regarding public oral health. All data were analyzed using chi-square and Pearson correlation test. Results. One hundred and fifty-seven out of 225 eligible personnel participated in the study. Sixty percent were <b>auxiliary</b> health <b>workers</b> (Behvarz). All personnel had a good level of knowledge regarding oral health. Despite significant differences among the knowledge of the personnel toward oral health, there was no significant difference between their knowledge related to their duties regarding oral health. The <b>auxiliary</b> health <b>worker</b> group had a higher rate (45. 6 %) for better public oral health practice. Conclusion. The study showed the personnel have good knowledge of their duties regarding oral health. However, their practice is not in line with their knowledge and needs more attention...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare Workers (HCWs) have {{a higher}} {{frequency}} of TB exposure {{than the general population}} and have therefore an occupational TB risk that infection prevention and control (IPC) measures aim to reduce. HCWs are crucial in the implementation of these measures. The objective {{of the study was to}} investigate Mozambican HCWs' perceptions of their occupational TB risk and the measures they report using to reduce this risk. In addition, we explored the challenges HCWs encounter while using these TBIPC measures. Focus group discussion. Analysis according content method. Four categories of HCWs: <b>auxiliary</b> <b>workers,</b> medical (doctors and clinical officers), nurses and TB program staff. HCWs are aware of their occupational TB risk and use various measures to reduce their risk of infection. HCWs find it challenging to employ measures that minimize such risks and a lack of clear guidelines contributes to these challenges. HCWs' and patient behavior further complicate the use of TBIPC measures. HCWs in Mozambique perceive a high occupational risk of TB infection. They report several challenges using measures to reduce this risk such as shortage of material, lack of clear guidelines, insufficient motivation and inadequate training. Robust training with motivational approaches, alongside supervision and support for HCWs could improve implementation of TBIPC measures. Healthcare management should address the areas for improvement that are beyond the individual HCW's contro...|$|R
40|$|The {{provision}} of medical facilities to rural areas {{is a major}} objective of development in Pakistan {{and the government has}} undertaken several programs to train and deploy <b>auxiliary</b> health <b>workers</b> on a large scale. Programs to train lady health visitors, dispensers and sanitary inspectors, have been in operation for decades and their graduates have a place in the workforce. Currently the Government is developing a Basic Health Program to train <b>auxiliary</b> health <b>workers</b> and to establish a network of rural health facilities throughout the country. The research here reported was meant to help plan this program. The 4 week study was conducted in four districts of the Punjab and North West Frontier Provinces. We first interviewed women patients of rural dispensaries in the four districts to determine their views of their needs and of the constraints of the purdah system when seeking health care. We then interviewed principals of medical colleges and training institutes, who were in a position to assess the availability of women to enter the medical workforce and female mid-level health workers who were currently serving in their posts. Finally, since allopathic medical institutions compete with indigenous medical specialists, we interviewed two hakims and a homeopathic physician to obtain their view of rural health needs, as well as their potential for contributing to a broad based rural health care system. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} countries, such as Uganda, skin {{problems are}} among the most common ailments seen in primary healthcare settings (1). Due to the dire lack of trained dermatologists, the vast majority of patients with skin diseases in these countries are treated by substitute <b>auxiliary</b> health <b>workers</b> with a limited education in skin disease management (1). To bridge this gap in access to dermatology services, we established a mobile teledermatology service and evaluated its applicability with regard to the impact of remote diagnoses on patient outcomes, as well as local health workers’ perception concerning this mode of dermatology consultation...|$|R
