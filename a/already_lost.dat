5|$|The British Empire had {{received}} the Christmas present the Prime Minister had wanted to give them, along with the moral prestige of effecting a Christian occupation of Jerusalem. It was a huge blow to the Ottoman Empire, which had suffered the loss of yet another Muslim Holy Place (having <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> Mecca and Baghdad).|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any <b>already</b> <b>lost.</b>|$|E

5|$|Odoacer {{advanced}} on Ravenna, {{capturing the}} city and the young emperor. Romulus was compelled to abdicate the throne on 4 September 476. This act has been cited {{as the end of the}} Western Roman Empire, although Romulus' deposition did not cause any significant disruption at the time. Rome had <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> its hegemony over the provinces, Germans dominated the Roman army and Germanic generals like Odoacer had long been the real powers behind the throne. Italy would suffer far greater devastation in the next century when Emperor Justinian I reconquered it.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 2008 Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko {{announced}} a reshuffle {{of the cabinet}} after the forming of a BYuT, OU-PSD and Bloc of Lytvyn coalition following the 2008 Ukrainian political crisis. On March 3, 2010 the Ukrainian Parliament passed a {{motion of no confidence}} in the second Tymoshenko Government. A day before that the coalition had <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> the parliamentary majority. On March 11, 2010 the First Azarov Government was elected.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Livonian War broke out, the Hanseatic League had <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> its {{monopoly}} on the profitable and prosperous Baltic Sea trade. While still involved and with increasing sales, it now shared the market with European mercenary fleets, most notably from the Dutch Seventeen Provinces and France. The Hanseatic vessels were no match for contemporary warships, and since the league was unable to maintain a large navy because of a declining share of trade, its Livonian members Riga, Reval and trading partner Narva were left without suitable protection. The Danish navy, the most powerful in the Baltic Sea, controlled {{the entrance to the}} Baltic Sea, collected requisite tolls, and held the strategically important Baltic Sea islands of Bornholm and Gotland.|$|E
5|$|In October 1940, Marcinkus reached Liverpool, {{and from}} there {{travelled}} on to London. On 24 December of the same year, Marcinkus became a pilot in the Royal Air Force (RAF). To achieve that, he changed some of his personal data; he stated that he was three years younger, otherwise {{he would have been}} too old for service in the RAF. At that time, his homeland Lithuania had <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> its independence, and the Lithuanian air force was rapidly liquidated by its occupiers. Throughout the years, Maricinkus maintained close contacts with the Lithuanian attaché in Britain in order to receive news about Lithuania and his family.|$|E

5|$|In spring 333 BC, Alexander {{crossed the}} Taurus into Cilicia. After {{a long pause}} due to illness, he marched on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Darius' {{significantly}} larger army, he marched back to Cilicia, where he defeated Darius at Issus. Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother Sisygambis, and a fabulous treasure. He offered a peace treaty that included the lands he had <b>already</b> <b>lost,</b> and a ransom of 10,000 talents for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.|$|E
5|$|Montagu {{was created}} Earl of Salisbury on 16 March 1337. This {{was one of}} six comital {{promotions}} Edward III made that day, in preparation for {{what was to become}} the Hundred Years' War. To allow Montagu to support his new status, the king granted him land and rent of a value of 1000 marks a year. The money was provided from the royal stannaries of Cornwall. A contemporary poem tells of a vow made by the earl {{on the eve of the}} warshe would not open one of his eyes while fighting in France. The story is probably a satire; the truth was that Montagu had <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> the use of one of his eyes in a tournament.|$|E
5|$|The {{northeast}} monsoon, {{which begins}} in September, lasts through the post-monsoon seasons, and only ends in March. It carries winds that have <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> their moisture {{out to the}} ocean (opposite from the summer monsoon). They cross India diagonally from northeast to southwest. However, the large indentation made by the Bay of Bengal into India's eastern coast means that the flows are humidified before reaching Cape Comorin and rest of Tamil Nadu, meaning that the state, and also some parts of Kerala, experience significant precipitation in the post-monsoon and winter periods. However, parts of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Mumbai also receive minor precipitation from the north-east monsoon.|$|E

5|$|With {{the series}} <b>already</b> <b>lost,</b> England made four changes to their team. Dewes {{replaced}} the injured Washbrook, while Watkins replaced Cranston as an all-rounder. Both Dewes and Watkins were making their Test debut. England played two spinners; Young replaced fellow finger spinner Laker, while the leg spin of Hollies replaced Pollard's pace. The selectors were widely condemned for their incessant changes. Australia made three changes. Off spinner Johnson {{was replaced by}} the leg spin of Ring. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured seamer Toshack {{was replaced by the}} recovered batsman Barnes. The final change was the return of wicket-keeper Tallon from injury.|$|E
5|$|Seeing all this, Captain Pierre-Jean Daniel André, {{the head}} of the Marash detachment, {{requested}} additional reinforcements but, due to the indecisiveness of his superior, Lt. Colonel Jean Flye-Sainte-Marie, he was ordered to go to Adana to apprise the division commander, Brigadier General Julien Dufieux, of the situation. Dufieux agreed to send extra men under the command of General Quérette to Marash but by 17 January, when the reinforcements arrived, the French had <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> the initiative: supply convoys in Bel Punar and El-Oghlu had come under attack and a relief column led by battalion commander Major Corneloup had been ambushed. On 21 January, General Quérette summoned the Muslim notables of Marash to his headquarters located at a barracks in the north of the city and presented them with evidence pointing to their complicity in the attacks and demanded that they {{put an end to the}} hostilities. As the leaders departed, Turkish police chief Arslan Toğuz drew out his pistol and fired five rounds into the air, signaling the beginning of the uprising.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} {{to get under way}} when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast staysail, and mizzen staysail tore. Having <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, and the next day at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E

5|$|The High Sparrow chides Queen Margaery Tyrell {{that she}} needs to provide King Tommen Baratheon with an heir, and that she should try to convert her {{grandmother}} Olenna to the Faith, subtly remarking that Olenna's safety cannot be guaranteed otherwise. Margaery meets with Olenna, who attempts to convince her to leave King's Landing and return to Highgarden. Margaery refuses, stating that as Queen, her place is supposed to be at King Tommen's side. Margaery discreetly slips her a piece of paper with the sigil of House Tyrell drawn on it, indicating that she is still loyal to her family, upon which Olenna agrees to leave. Cersei Lannister then confronts Olenna, and tries to convince her to stay and fight the Sparrows. Olenna points out that they have <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> and blames the Sparrows' rise to power on Cersei's lack of foresight. Despite having no allies in King's Landing, Cersei decides to stay and fight.|$|E
5|$|With {{the series}} <b>already</b> <b>lost,</b> England made four changes to their team. Dewes {{replaced}} Washbrook, who {{was suffering from}} a thumb injury, {{at the top of}} the order. Watkins replaced Cranston as the middle order batsman and bowler. Both Dewes and Watkins were making their Test debut. England played two spinners; Young replaced fellow finger spinner Laker, while the leg spin of Hollies replaced Pollard. The selectors were widely condemned for their changes. Australia made three changes. Having taken only seven wickets in the first four Tests at an average of 61.00, off spinner Johnson was replaced by the leg spin of Ring. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured Toshack was replaced by the recovered Barnes, meaning that Australia were playing with one extra batsman and one less frontline bowler. The final change was the return of wicket-keeper Tallon from injury.|$|E
5|$|With {{the series}} <b>already</b> <b>lost,</b> the England {{selectors}} {{continued to make}} many changes, on this occasion, four. In all, they had used 21 players for the series and were severely criticised for failing to maintain continuity. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss, and elected to bat on a pitch affected by rain. After a delayed start due to inclement weather, the Australian pace attack, led by Ray Lindwall, dismissed England within the first day for just 52. Lindwall was the main destroyer, taking six wickets for 20 runs (6/20). The English batsmen {{found it difficult to}} cope with his prodigious swing and pace; four of his wickets were either bowled or leg before wicket. Len Hutton was the only batsman to resist, making 30 before being the final man dismissed. In reply, Australia's opening pair of Arthur Morris and Sid Barnes passed England's score on the same afternoon with no loss of wickets. The opening stand ended at 117 when Barnes fell for 61 and Bradman came to the crease to a standing ovation and three cheers from his opponents. He fell second ball, but Australia reached 153/2 at stumps on the first day.|$|E
