25|$|Under Bradlee's leadership, The Washington Post took {{on major}} {{challenges}} during the Nixon administration. In 1971 The New York Times and the Post successfully challenged the government {{over the right}} to publish the Pentagon Papers. One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee: You {{had a lot of}} Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.|$|E

She introduced herself to him, saying that she had a good voice. When Dhani asked how good, she replied [...] "Amazing. [...] as good as Mariah Carey." [...] Mambo then received Dhani's number, which she used to call him repeatedly and ask for an album. On the fifth day, Maia <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and eventually offered Mambo the position of vocalist with Ratu. Although Mambo wanted to be a soloist, she accepted and had an audition at Maia's home, where she was accepted before she could finish singing. Before she began work with Ratu, Pinkan was given training as a backing vocalist for Dewa 19.|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by James Foley, who worked with Madonna in her music video for [...] "Live to Tell", produced by David Naylor and Sharon Oreck, and Michael Ballhaus {{was in charge of}} the photography. The video was shot on location over three days in Staten Island, New York and Manhattan. Staten Island was chosen on Foley's suggestion as it was where he grew up: [...] "We talked about wanting to tap into a working-class environment, because by that time she had done 'Material Girl' and 'Like a Virgin' and other stuff that was very glamorous and stylized. She wanted to do something a bit more grounded and 'drama'." [...] Actor Alex McArthur was signed to play Madonna's boyfriend and the father of her child in the video. Madonna had spotted McArthur in a small role as a naive youth in the 1985 film Desert Hearts, and she thought he was a natural to play her mechanic boyfriend. [...] "I was out in the garage working on my Harley," [...] said McArthur, [...] "I <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and a voice said, 'Hi, this is Madonna. I would like you to be in my next video.'" ...|$|E

[...] The 1970s' [...] "I Listen to CHUM" [...] promotion had DJs dialing phone numbers at random and awarding $1,000 to anyone who <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> with that phrase. [...] In 1976, there was the CHUM Starsign promotion. [...] Listeners wore a button featuring their astrological sign. [...] If CHUM's 'Starsign spotter' saw you wearing your Starsign, you won prizes such as money or concert tickets to major events.|$|E
2500|$|Davis who <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> from Rich and Friedman, said, [...] "I {{love the}} song {{the way it}} is; it's a hit. Of course, {{take a shot at}} {{rewriting}} the lyric, but whatever you do, don't lose the hitness of it. If the rewrite doesn't work, we can use the song on a future Whitney project, maybe her greatest hits album." [...] Rich and Friedman ultimately rewrote the entire lyric except for the title. They then redemoed the song and sent the new version to Davis. Davis, Jackson and everyone involved loved the new version of [...] "Run to You", so the song was finally set for the movie.|$|E

2500|$|Mailer {{software}} {{was responsible for}} transferring files and messages between systems, as well as passing control to other applications, such as the BBS software, at appropriate times. [...] The mailer would initially answer the phone and, if necessary, deal with incoming mail via FidoNet transfer protocols. [...] If the mailer <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and a human caller was detected rather than other mailer software, the mailer would exit, and pass control to the BBS software, which would then initialise for interaction with the user. [...] When outgoing mail was waiting on the local system, the mailer software would attempt to send it {{from time to time}} by dialing and connecting to other systems who would accept and route the mail further. [...] Due to the costs of toll calls which often varied between peak and off-peak times, mailer software would usually allow its operator to configure the optimal times in which to attempt to send mail to other systems.|$|E

2500|$|A {{statement}} {{released by}} the Afghan interior ministry said, [...] "The initial findings of the ministry show that the main target of this attack has not been security forces like in most attacks but has been particularly planned to target the Indian embassy". There was immediate confusion and panic in the Indian embassy after the bomb blasts. According to a CNN reporter, a man who <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> at the Indian embassy abruptly hung up, saying, [...] "We are not fine. All communications have been cut off". The Ministry of External Affairs of Government of India {{was reported to be}} in touch with India's ambassador to Afghanistan, Jayant Prasad. The Indian ambassador and his deputy were inside the building complex at the time of the explosion but were not hurt. Indian External Affairs Minister, Pranab Mukherjee, called for an emergency meeting of officials in Delhi after the bomb attack to review security arrangements. An anonymous person reported that rumours said the Indian embassy had previously received bomb threats.|$|E
2500|$|DeVille {{recorded}} Miracle in London with Mark Knopfler {{serving as}} his sideman and producer. He said, [...] "It was Mark (Knopfler’s) wife Lourdes {{who came up}} with the idea (to record Miracle). She said to him that you don't sing like Willy and he doesn't play guitar like you, but you really like his stuff so why don't you do an album together?" [...] "Storybook Love", a song from Miracle and the theme song of the movie The Princess Bride, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987; DeVille performed the song at that year's Academy Awards telecast.Knopfler heard ("Storybook Love") and asked if I knew about this movie he was doing. It was a Rob Reiner film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and he loved it. About six or seven months later, I was half asleep when the phone rang. It was the Academy of Arts and Sciences with the whole spiel. I hung up on them! They called back and Lisa (his wife) <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> She came in to tell me that I was nominated for [...] "Storybook Love." [...] It's pretty wild.

2500|$|Of {{the episodes}} from 6 August, All About Soap said that [...] "the finger of {{suspicion}} [...] is pointing firmly [...] Michael Moon this fortnight." [...] Following {{the scene of}} Michael snapping at Janine and leaving her with their baby, the magazine thought he could be seeking comfort from Kat, and Janine also overhears Michael arranging to meet someone, which they thought could be Kat. Kat also tells Janine that Michael was having doubts on their wedding day, which they thought could be [...] "Kat's sly way of telling her nemesis that Michael would rather be with another woman", and when Janine sees Michael taking cash from her safe, he could be using it to fund the flat. The same week, Janine telephones Michael, but when he answers his phone, Kat is also calling her lover, which Inside Soap says would leave viewers wondering who he had <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to. After Ray was eliminated as a suspect, Inside Soap said that Michael seemed to become the front-runner, as there had been looks between him and Kat, and Kat seemed distraught, and when Kat {{had a conversation with}} Janine, Kat told Michael that she did not tell her [...] "everything". Jack had become involved with Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) and Max had his own problems. However, again they felt it could be a red herring and Derek could be the one as he had been [...] "conspicuous by his absence".|$|E
