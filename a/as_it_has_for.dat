50|$|The church {{building}} {{was named a}} National Historic Landmark in 1975. A major restoration, lasting from 1978 to 1990, preserved the structure so that the parish could continue to serve the people of New Orleans <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> 150 years.|$|R
25|$|The Canmore Hotel sits on {{the main}} street <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> over 100 years. The {{building}} is now going through a restoration renovation. The hotel celebrated its 120th anniversary in October 2010.|$|E
25|$|Honesdale, the County seat, {{hosts the}} annual Wayne County Fair, {{starting}} {{on the first}} Friday in August <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> over a century. The Fair spans nine days and draws thousands of visitors. It features typical county-fair events like horse racing, tractor pulling, livestock exhibits, concerts and other entertainments, many rides for children, crafts, home goods, and much more.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth in}} {{usage of the}} Panama Canal {{over the past few}} years has been almost entirely driven by {{increased}} US imports from China passing through the canal en route to ports on the US East and Gulf coasts. But it is increasingly recognized in both the US and China that this imbalance in trade is unsustainable and will be reduced via some sort of adjustment in the coming years (although such an imbalance need not be made up by physically shipped goods, but could be made by other trade such as intellectual property as China upgrades its intellectual property protection laws). The ACP, however, presumes that trade will continue to grow for a generation <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> the past several years.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this treaty}} {{continued}} in force until August 1898, the U.S. did not fortify Pearl Harbor as a naval base. The shallow entrance constituted a formidable barrier {{against the use}} of the deep protected waters of the inner harbor <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> 60 years.|$|R
50|$|Sangley {{continued}} to serve {{essentially the same}} function for the U.S. Navy <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> the Spanish navy. The coaling facilities on the eastern end {{continued to}} supply the Navy with coal until ships converted to oil when a tank farm was established.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 the {{hospital}} was expanded by Kim Jong-un with a new wing, equipped with modern medical equipment, which houses the Breast Cancer Research Center. The hospital has a personal connection <b>for</b> Kim Jong-un, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> his father Kim Jong-il, as Kim Jong-un's mother Ko Yong-hui died due to breast cancer.|$|R
500|$|AACS {{can be used}} {{to revoke}} a key of a {{specific}} playback device, after it is known to have been compromised, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> WinDVD. The compromised players can still be used to view old discs, but not newer releases without encryption keys for the compromised players. If other players are then cracked, further revocation would lead to legitimate users of compromised players being forced to upgrade or replace their player software or firmware in order to view new discs. Each playback device comes with a binary tree of secret device and processing keys. The processing key in this tree, a requirement to play the AACS encrypted discs, is selected based on the device key and the information on the disc to be played. As such, a processing key such as the [...] "09 F9" [...] key is not revoked, but newly produced discs cause the playback devices to select a different valid processing key to decrypt the discs.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{equipment}} available in 2009, full examination with imaging techniques that allow underpainting {{to be seen}} was not possible. [...] It was thought that this might shed more light on any contribution by Michelangelo to the underpainting, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> the Viterbo Pietà, Sebastiano's first major collaboration with Michelangelo. [...] By 2017, imaging had indeed revealed that the present figure of Lazarus, based on Michelangelo's drawing, lay over a different figure, presumably designed by Sebastiano.|$|E
2500|$|Classification of {{the species}} has also proved difficult, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> much of the Sarcophagidae family. C.H. Murran, for instance, {{included}} Sarcophagidae in a larger family, Metopidae, that added some Muscidae and some Tachinidae. [...] Most, however, consider S. bullata {{to be a member}} of the Sarcophaginae subfamily within Sarcophagidae. Beyond that, the family can be split into tribes before defining genus. S. bullata is widely accepted {{to be a member of}} the Sarcophaga genus, but it is also included by some into a subgenus, Neobellieria.|$|E

50|$|National Geographic {{picked up}} the {{television}} adaptation of Killing Jesus, just <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> Killing Lincoln and Killing Kennedy. It was written by Walon Green and directed by Christopher Menaul. Ridley Scott, David W. Zucker and Mary Lisio, who also produced Killing Kennedy, were executive producers. The series debuted on Palm Sunday 2015 (March 29), breaking viewership records set by Killing Kennedy.|$|R

2500|$|A {{censorship}} {{effort by}} the Confucius Institutes international director Xu Lin against Taiwan occurred in Portugal in July 2014. Upon her arrival on 23 July 2014, at a European Sinology conference partly organized by {{the director of the}} Confucius Institute at the University of Minho, Braga, Portugal, the international head of the Confucius Institutes, Xu Lin, [...] ordered censorship of [...] "important pages" [...] that included references to Taiwan institutions, one of which, the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation, was also funding the conference <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> the past 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|Such {{a genetic}} impact is {{evidence}} for substantially greater fitness of Old Gray {{compared to the}} other inbred wolves on the island. Scientists expected that such an introduction would create a [...] "genetic rescue" [...] population boom, but it did not happen. [...] "A co-author of the study, Rolf O. Peterson, a research professor at Michigan Technological University, said that the population of Isle Royale hangs on by a thread, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> decades. The average reproduction after the Old Gray Guy arrived was no different from before. Yet {{this does not mean that}} he had no effect." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 20, 2015, Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO), {{along with}} 1 Republican and 18 Democratic cosponsors, {{introduced}} the Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act, which would have, among other provisions, directed the Attorney General to remove marijuana from all schedules of controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act; prohibited transport of marijuana into a jurisdiction in which its possession, use, or sale is prohibited; and granted the Food and Drug Administration the same authorities {{with respect to}} marijuana <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> alcohol. The bill was referred to committee but died when no further action was taken.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{neighboring}} pisco which spread itself {{across two}} contending countries, singani {{has always been}} made only in the territory that is today Bolivia, and no domain controversy exists <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> pisco. [...] An exclusive regional product for over 400 years, Bolivia only in recent decades has moved to protect its interests. [...] Part of the motivation was to establish standards so that moonshine could not be called singani. [...] Another impetus was to solidify control of the singani name, [...] the unsatisfactory experience of pisco and of tequila which can be exported in bulk and bottled under foreign labels being cases in point.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the summer}} months, the track was resurfaced {{in an effort}} to reduce its {{bumpiness}} and the pit lane was re-profiled with the entry brought forward from the Arquibancadas corner to move it off the racing line and a chicane added to the pit lane to further slow cars entering the pit lane following a series of heavy accidents in national races. The pit lane exit was moved further away from the circuit to allow for a run-off area on the outside of turn two. In addition, in response to the incident suffered by Jules Bianchi during the Japanese Grand Prix, procedures relating to the location of a tractor crane serving the Senna [...] "S" [...] chicane were also altered. Pirelli originally nominated the orange-banded Hard and white-banded Medium tyres, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> the event since 2012. However, following the Russian Grand Prix one month prior, many drivers criticised the low level of grip and wear shown on the new tarmac of the Sochi Autodrom. Since the Autódromo José Carlos Pace was completely repaved, there was concern that the hard compound would be [...] "very dangerous". Along with unanimous agreement from all eleven teams, Pirelli ultimately decided to bring the Medium and yellow-banded Soft tyres to the event.|$|E
2500|$|After {{seeing the}} film, The New York Times noted the requiem tone {{captured}} by the film, describing it as [...] "a sleek, muscle car of a movie made in the USA, in that industrial graveyard called Detroit". Manohla Dargis compared Eastwood's presence on film to Dirty Harry and the Man with No Name, stating: [...] "Dirty Harry is back, in a way, in Gran Torino, not as a character, but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high-caliber imagery, and of course, most obviously, in Mr. Eastwood’s face. It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated {{that it no longer}} looks merely weathered, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> decades, but seems closer to petrified wood." [...] The Los Angeles Times also praised Eastwood's performance and credibility as an action hero at the age of 78. Kenneth Turan said of Eastwood's performance, [...] "It is a film that is impossible to imagine without the actor in the title role. The notion of a 78-year-old action hero may sound like a contradiction in terms, but Eastwood brings it off, even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical. Even at 78, Eastwood can make [...] "Get off my lawn" [...] sound as menacing as [...] "Make my day", and when he says [...] "I blow a hole in your face and sleep like a baby", he sounds as if he means it". Roger Ebert wrote that the film is [...] "about the belated flowering of a man's better nature. And it's about Americans of different races growing more open to one another in the new century." [...] Sang Chi and Emily Moberg Robinson, editors of Voices of the Asian-American and Pacific Islander Experience: Volume 1, said that within the mainstream media, the film received [...] "criticial acclaim" [...] "for its nuanced portrayal of Asian Americans." [...] Louisa Schein and Va-Megn Thoj, authors of [...] "Gran Torino’s Boys and Men with Guns: Hmong Perspective," [...] said that the mainstream critical response was [...] "centered on Eastwood‘s character and viewed the film mainly as a vision of multicultural inclusion and understanding." ...|$|E
50|$|Castle's first {{credited}} {{role was}} as Flo in the 1950 film The Tougher They Come. Columbia plotted Castle's career <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> Rita Hayworth {{when she had}} first signed with Columbia: frequent exposure and seasoning in the studio's low-budget films. Most of Mary Castle's early Columbias were Westerns: Prairie Roundup, Texans Never Cry (with Gene Autry), and When the Redskins Rode. With an obvious resemblance to Hayworth, she {{was seen as the}} object of soldiers' dreams in Columbia's 1952 war film Eight Iron Men.|$|R
50|$|Ancient Melodies of the Future is {{the fifth}} {{full-length}} album released by indie rock band Built to Spill. The core line-up of the band remained <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> the previous two albums, with singer/guitarist Doug Martsch, bassist Brett Nelson, and drummer Scott Plouf. The album was recorded at Bear Creek in Woodinville, Washington, with overdubs recorded at Avast! Recording Co. in Seattle, Washington, and Martsch's studio, The Manhouse, in Boise, Idaho. Ancient Melodies was released on the Warner Bros. label in 2001 (see 2001 in music).|$|R
50|$|Aoki visited Japanese-occupied Batavia in May 1943, {{meeting with}} Mohammad Hatta, who as {{representative}} for the Indonesian nationalists, advised him that unless there was a shift in Japanese policy towards granting independence <b>for</b> Indonesia (<b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> Burma and the Philippines), it would be increasingly difficult to maintain popular support for Japan. Aoki promised to raise the issue with Tōjō, who mentioned his intent to grant independence to Malaya, Sumatra, Java, Borneo and Sulawesi within a year in his June 1943 parliamentary speech.|$|R
60|$|However, {{the reader}} will soon {{discover}} that {{it is much more}} than that. Carried along on the boisterous rush of the narrative by Chesterton's wonderful high-spirited style, he will soon see that he is being carried into much deeper waters than he had planned on; and the totally unforeseeable denouement will prove for the modern reader, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> thousands of others since 1908 when the book was first published, an inevitable and moving experience, as the investigators finally discover who Sunday is.|$|E
6000|$|They {{began with}} the office and the parlor, where they flung up the windows, and opened the doors, and then they opened the dining-room, where the tables stood in long rows, with the chairs piled on them legs upward. Cynthia went about with many sighs for the dust on everything, though to Westover's eyes it all seemed frigidly clean. [...] "If it goes on <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> the past two years," [...] she said, [...] "we shall have to add on a new dining-room. I don't know as I like to have it get so large!" ...|$|E
60|$|Let me ask {{one thing}} in closing. I have written for you here many things most painful for me to remember, because I wanted you to love and honor the memory of your mother. I wanted that her memory should have {{something}} such a charm for you <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> me. With me, her image has always stood between me and all other women; but I have never even intimated to a living being that such a passage in my history ever occurred,--no, not even to my sister, who is nearer to me than any other earthly creature.|$|E
50|$|During the Great Depression, {{there was}} great poverty in Springs, and the {{community}} got by, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> so many generations, by fishing and farming. Until the late 20th century, Springs was an isolated hamlet, without bus service, train service, or even many automobiles. As late as the 1940s, children walked some ten miles, there and back, to attend {{high school in the}} village, on Newtown Lane (where East Hampton Middle School now is). It was a very tight-knit community; the Presbyterian Church was an important gathering place.|$|R
50|$|Avance {{was shut}} down by the {{government}} for a period in 1980 early, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> called <b>for</b> strikes. By late February 1980 Avance was officially branded as 'counter-revolutionary' in the government discourse.|$|R
