25|$|If {{any public}} holiday falls on a Sunday in Singapore, the {{following}} day is declared {{to be a public}} holiday if it is not itself already a public holiday. Thus, since National Day (9 August) in 2015 landed on a Sunday, two <b>additional</b> <b>holidays</b> were given (on August 7 and August 10). The president is empowered to declare any day to be observed as a public holiday in addition to or substitution for any day specified in the schedule to the Holidays Act, and may also declare any day in a year to be observed as an additional public holiday when in that year two public holidays fall on the same day.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in the model description in the previous Sect. 4.4, the <b>additional</b> <b>holiday</b> dummy approach might be inappropriate for the fixed-date public holidays. However, this issue might be solved by combining the holiday as weekday approach (Sect. 4.3) with the <b>additional</b> <b>holiday</b> dummy methods (Sect. 4.4). So {{it is able to}} construct a model that joins the properties of both public holiday modeling approaches efficiently.|$|R

The representatives AdwhRpfh and AdwhRpfH show similar performance to the replacing methods.

30|$|We {{have seen}} the <b>additional</b> public <b>holiday</b> {{approach}} where public holidays are added and the replacing one where public holidays are added but the corresponding weekday dummies is replaced by 0. The replacing method was mainly introduced by the problem that additional approach double counts fixed-date public holiday on weekends (esp. Sunday). However, this is only an issue for fixed-date public holidays but not for weekday holidays. So {{there is also the}} option of considering the replacing approach for the weekday public holidays, but keeping the (simple) <b>additional</b> <b>holiday</b> approach.|$|R
25|$|Before Waitangi Day {{was made}} a {{national}} public holiday it was sometimes suggested that a Waitangi Day holiday should replace the anniversary days, and the Waitangi Day Act 1960 made provision for this. Waitangi Day was eventually made an <b>additional</b> <b>holiday</b> and the provincial holidays lived on, primarily because most regions had long established events on those weekends.|$|R
30|$|However, {{as pointed}} out in Sect. 2, only weekday public {{holidays}} occur always on the same weekday. Here the <b>additional</b> <b>holiday</b> dummies approach seems to be reasonable as the impact to the holiday {{is more or less}} the same in every year. However, for modeling fixed-date public holidays we might run into troubles with the additional approach.|$|R
50|$|The President of Tanzania may declare <b>additional</b> <b>holidays</b> at {{his or her}} discretion, for example, {{during the}} general {{election}} day. The President of Zanzibar may do the same within the semi-autonomous islands of Zanzibar.

Currently, the provinces of Alberta and Prince Edward Island have the most legislated holidays in comparison to other provinces and territories, with 12 days off.|$|E
50|$|Schools {{are closed}} on {{national}} and state public holidays. Schools are allowed {{to have a few}} special holidays without replacement for events such as school anniversary and sports day. For festivities such as Hari Raya Puasa, Chinese New Year and Deepavali, schools usually apply for <b>additional</b> <b>holidays</b> to allow longer breaks for students to visit relatives in their hometowns. However, every day missed exceeding the special holiday allowance would be replaced by having classes on weekends.|$|E

30|$|As mentioned, {{there are}} only a very few limited studies that compare {{different}} public holiday modeling methods. In a small daily load forecasting study, reference [5] compare four different methods to deal with public holidays were evaluated in a neural net framework. First, an <b>additional</b> <b>holiday</b> dummy (A 1), second the holidays were treated as a Sunday (A 2), third an additional factor variable is introduced (similarly as in [52]) was used to code the day before the holiday, the holiday itself, and the day after the holiday (A 3) and fourth a methodology (A 2) and (A 3) combined. Reference [5] concludes that the method A 3 performs best. However, their out-of sample period was only 2 month. Further no significant statements are made. Still, A 3 can be regarded as an additional dummy approach that additionally takes bridging effects into account. However, in our analysis, the <b>additional</b> <b>holiday</b> dummy approach is outperformed by the holiday as Sunday model and even more significantly by the replacing public holiday model.|$|R

50|$|Bank {{and public}} {{holidays}} in Scotland are determined under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 and the St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007. Unlike {{the rest of}} United Kingdom, most bank holidays are not recognised as statutory public holidays in Scotland, as most public holidays are determined by local authorities across Scotland. Some of these may be taken in lieu of statutory holidays, while others may be <b>additional</b> <b>holidays,</b> although many companies, including Royal Mail, do not follow all the holidays listed below; and many swap between English and local holidays. Many large shops and supermarkets continue to operate normally during public holidays, especially {{since there are no}} restrictions such as Sunday trading rules in Scotland.|$|E
50|$|As in 2008, when Labour Day and Ascension {{were both}} on May 1, {{employers}} {{were required to}} declare an <b>additional</b> <b>holiday</b> on another day in the month.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1870s Lubbock became {{increasingly}} interested in politics. In 1870, {{and again in}} 1874, he was elected as a Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Maidstone. He lost the seat at the election of 1880, but was at once elected member for London University, {{of which he had}} been vice-chancellor since 1872. As an MP, Lubbock had a distinguished political career, with four main political agendas: promotion of the study of science in primary and secondary schools; the national debt, free trade, and related economic issues; protection of ancient monuments; securing of <b>additional</b> <b>holidays</b> and shorter working hours for the working classes. He was successful with numerous enactments in parliament, including the Bank Holidays Act of 1871 and the Ancient Monuments Act of 1882, along with another 28 acts of Parliament. When the Liberals split in 1886 on the issue of Irish Home Rule, Lubbock joined the breakaway Liberal Unionist Party in opposition to Irish home rule. A prominent supporter of the Statistical Society, he took an active part in criticizing the encroachment of municipal trading and the increase of the municipal debt.|$|E

5000|$|In Australia, summer officially lasts from December to February, and {{therefore}} includes Christmas and New Year holidays. The dates of Australian school holidays (the term used, rather than [...] "vacation") {{are determined by}} each state's Department of Education, the Christmas summer holiday being the longest in duration. Typically Christmas summer holiday in Australia last approximately six weeks, usually from mid-December (depending on school year, see below) to late January. This is significantly shorter than North American summer holiday, but Australian schools also break for two weeks at Easter, and in June and September, giving students and teachers a total of twelve weeks of annual holidays. In many public schools, years 10 through 12 will finish before December 15, allowing time to complete exam marking and results. Year 10 commonly finishes {{at the end of}} November, Year 11 at the end of October, and year 12 (Senior Year) also at mid or the end of October after 3 weeks of end-of-year exams. This can bring the normal 12 weeks of vacation to 20 weeks of vacation. The intervening periods of school operation without holidays are called [...] "School Terms", each term lasting approximately ten weeks. All Australian states have relatively similar holiday periods between each term, but there is the ability for this to change, {{as it did in the}} Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games, when the first term in Victorian schools was shortened to 6 weeks and the other subsequently extended to 12 weeks due to severe disruptions to the public and private bus networks used by school students. Most private schools in Australia have up to four weeks of <b>additional</b> <b>holidays,</b> due to their longer teaching hours during term.|$|E
5000|$|While all current federal {{holidays}} {{have also}} been made public holidays in all 50 states for federal organizations, each state is not bound to observe the holidays on the same dates as the federal holidays. Many states also have <b>additional</b> <b>holidays</b> that are not observed by the U.S. federal government. Many businesses likewise observe certain holidays as well, which are also not mandated by any government agency. A list of [...] "recommended diversity holidays" [...] recognizes many cultures that range from Christianity to Islam, as well as racial diversity where various ethnic holidays such as St. Patrick's Day, Kwanzaa, Diwali, Mardi Gras, and Cinco de Mayo are celebrated by individuals in the workplace, {{as a matter of}} best practice. In light of recent race issues in the United States, many municipalities both at the city and state levels have begun celebrating Malcolm X Day and Rosa Parks Day in addition to Martin Luther King, Jr. Day to embrace the mostly disenfranchised African American community in the form of festivals and parades if not done as a legal public holiday. Illinois and Berkeley, California are two places where Malcolm X is honored with a legal holiday with offices closed whereas Missouri honored Rosa Parks on her birthday. Today, the United States is the 85th most ethnically diverse country in the world. While the popularity of each public holiday cannot easily be measured, the holiday with the highest greeting card sales is Christmas. Major retail establishments such as malls, shopping centers and most retail stores close only on Thanksgiving and Christmas and some on Easter Sunday as well, but remain open on all other holidays (early closing on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, and sometimes on other major holidays). Virtually all companies observe and close on the major holidays (New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas). Some non-retail business close on the day after Thanksgiving, while some (such as federal banks and post offices) are not allowed to close on the day after Thanksgiving. Some smaller businesses normally open on Sunday will close on Easter Sunday, if it is their experience they will have very few customers that day.|$|E

The aim of this survey is to discover recreational and tourist activity of Scottish residents Main Topics : Variables The Scottish Tourism and Recreation Survey, 1973 consists of three groups of files: the Home Interview files, the Holidays files and the Cordon Survey files. The Home Interview Survey files (SN: 2490) are based on 6938 interviews with 169 questions covering general matters, day trips, outdoor recreation, short stays, <b>additional</b> <b>holidays,</b> Scottish main holidays and theatre. The Holidays files (SN: 2491) amalgamate data from both the Home Interview Survey files and the Cordon Survey files. Each case corresponds to a holiday, including short holidays and winter and early spring holidays for Scottish residents. The Cordon Survey files (SN: 2492) are {{based on interviews with}} holidaymakers as they were leaving Scotland by rail, coach, ferry and plane. Different questionnaires were used at each cordon type, based on a common set of questions. The files consist of direct interview data, self-administered questionnaire data and route map and accommodation diary data...|$|E
