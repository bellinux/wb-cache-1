50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>fairly</b> tame, {{but often}} stays hidden under a bush. It <b>is</b> <b>fairly</b> common in {{habitats}} with sagebrush {{and other such}} bushes. It is uncommonly seen because of its tendency to stay under cover.|$|R
5|$|Members <b>are</b> <b>fairly</b> well {{distributed}} {{across the}} United States. California {{has the largest}} number of members, followed by Texas and Florida. However, the states with the highest membership rates are Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alaska, Montana, and Hawaii. Growing AG congregations tend to be located in suburban areas, as opposed to urban and rural ones.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally carbenes {{are viewed}} as so {{reactive}} that were only studied indirectly, e.g. by trapping reactions. This situation has changed dramatically {{with the emergence of}} persistent carbenes. Although they <b>are</b> <b>fairly</b> reactive substances, i.e., undergoing dimerization, many can be isolated as pure substances.|$|E
50|$|This species <b>is</b> <b>fairly</b> {{common at}} middle {{elevations}} on Caribbean Slope, south to Reventazon River; from 600 to 1500 m. Also it <b>is</b> <b>fairly</b> common on Pacific slope of Guanacaste and Tilarán Cordilleras; from 1200 to 1500 m.|$|R

5|$|A double-double {{is defined}} as a {{performance}} in which a player accumulates a double-digit number total in two of five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots—in a game. The most common double-double combination is points and rebounds, followed by points and assists. Double-doubles <b>are</b> <b>fairly</b> common in the NBA. During the 2008–09 season, 69 players who were eligible for leadership in the main statistical categories recorded at least 10 double-doubles during the season.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{geological}} {{layout of the}} Rhondda Valley, transport links <b>are</b> <b>fairly</b> restrictive. The original road layout followed the valleys with few connections between them. In the 1920s, a major unemployment relief programme for out of work miners was created to build mountain roads connecting communities together. The mountain roads had a lasting effect and transformed the valleys from being dead-end communities. In the late 20th and early 21st century, new road projects such as the Rhondda by-pass have been created out of former railway lines.|$|E

5|$|During Soviet times, stanitsas, {{no longer}} being Cossack settlements, still {{encompassed}} relatively large populations. In 1926, for example, the populations of five of the sixteen stanitsas then existing exceeded five thousand. As of 2014, there are twelve stanitsas in the republic, accounting for 5.3% of the republic's rural localities, but their combined population accounts for {{almost a quarter of}} the republic's rural population. They <b>are</b> <b>fairly</b> evenly spread across the republic's territory.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs <b>are</b> <b>fairly</b> {{abundant}} and {{are found in}} many areas around the world. There {{is no evidence that}} they transmit diseases to humans or other animals. Their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous, but in reality, even the curved pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans. It is a common myth that earwigs crawl into the human ear and lay eggs in the brain.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{occurs in}} a number of other animals {{including}} dogs and cats and is the most common brain disorder in dogs. It is typically treated with anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital or bromide in dogs and phenobarbital in cats. Imepitoin is also used in dogs. While generalized seizures in horses <b>are</b> <b>fairly</b> easy to diagnose, it may be more difficult in non-generalized seizures and EEGs may be useful.|$|E

5|$|Francium's {{ability to}} be synthesized, trapped, and cooled, along with its {{relatively}} simple atomic structure, has made it the subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments. These experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which <b>are</b> <b>fairly</b> similar to those predicted by quantum theory.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal orb webs <b>are</b> <b>fairly</b> common, {{despite being}} less {{effective}} at intercepting and retaining prey and {{more vulnerable to}} damage by rain and falling debris. Various researchers have suggested that horizontal webs offer compensating advantages, such as reduced vulnerability to wind damage; reduced visibility to prey flying upwards, because of the back-lighting from the sky; enabling oscillations to catch insects in slow horizontal flight. However, {{there is no single}} explanation for the common use of horizontal orb webs.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are EF0 and EF1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes. The rate of {{occurrence}} drops off quickly with increasing strength—less than 1% are violent tornadoes (EF4, T8 or stronger). Outside Tornado Alley, and North America in general, violent tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions <b>are</b> <b>fairly</b> similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively.|$|E
