40|$|Apart from accuracy, {{one of the}} {{parameters}} describing industrial robots is positioning accuracy. The parameter in question, which {{is the subject of}} this paper, is often the decisive factor determining whether to apply a given robot to perform certain tasks or not. Articulated robots are predominantly used in such processes as: spot weld-ing, transport of materials and other welding applications, where high positioning repeatability is required. It is therefore essential to recognise the parameter in question and to control it throughout the operation of the robot. This paper presents methodology for robot positioning accuracy measurements based on vision technique. The measurements were conducted with Phantom v 2511 high-speed camera and TEMA Motion software, for motion analysis. The object of the measurements was a 6 -axis Yaskawa Motoman HP 20 F industrial robot. The results of measurements obtained in tests provided data for the calculation of positioning accuracy of the robot, which was then juxtaposed against robot specifications. Also analysed was the impact of the direction of displacement on the value of <b>attained</b> <b>pose</b> errors. Test results are given in a graphic form...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} fully {{understand}} the interaction between phenotype and genotype x environment to improve crop performance, {{a large amount of}} phenotypic data is needed. Studying plants of a given strain under multiple environments can greatly help to reveal their interactions. This thesis presents two key portions of the development of the Enviratron rover, a robotic system that aims to autonomously collect the labor-intensive data required to perform experiments in this area. The rover {{is part of a larger}} project which will track plant growth in multiple environments. The first aspects of the robot discussed in this thesis is the system hardware and main, or whole-chamber, imaging system. Semi-autonomous behavior is currently achieved, and the system performance in probing leaves is quantified and discussed. In contrast to existing systems, the rover can follow magnetic tape along all four directions (front, left, back, right), and uses a Microsoft Kinect V 2 mounted on the end-effector of a robotic arm to position a threaded rod, simulating future sensors such as fluorimeter and Raman Spectrometer, at a desired position and orientation. Advantages of the tape following include being able to reliably move both between chambers and within a chamber regardless of dust and lighting conditions. The robot arm and Kinect system is unique in its speed at reconstructing an (filtered) environment when combined with its accuracy at positioning sensors. A comparison of using raw camera coordinates data and using KinectFusion data is presented. The results suggest that the KinectFusion pose estimation is fairly accurate, only decreasing accuracy by a few millimeters at distances of roughly 0. 8 meter. The system can consistently position sensors to within 4 cm of the goal, and often within 3 cm. The system is shown to be accurate enough to position sensors to ÃÂ± 9 degrees of a desired orientation, although currently this accuracy requires human input to fully utilize the Kinect’s feedback. The second aspect of the robot presented in this thesis is a framework for generating collision-free robot arm motion within the chamber. This framework uses feedback from the Kinect sensor and is based on the Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) technique, which involves creating a graph of collision-free nodes and edges, and then searching for an acceptable path. The variant presented uses a dilated, down-sampled, KinectFusion as input for rapid collision checking, effectively representing the environment as a discretized grid and representing the robot arm as a collection of spheres. The approach combines many desirable characteristics of previous PRM methods and other collision-avoidance schemes, and is aimed at providing a reliable, rapidly-constructed, highly-connected roadmap which can be queried multiple times in a static environment, such as a growth chamber or a greenhouse. In a sample plant configuration with several of the most challenging practical goal poses, it is shown to create a roadmap in an average time of 32. 5 seconds. One key feature is that nodes are added near the goal during each query, in order to increase accuracy at the expense of increased query time. A completed graph is searched for an optimal path connecting nodes near the starting pose and the desired end pose. The fastest graph search studied was an implementation of the A* algorithm. Queries using this framework took an average time of 0. 46 seconds. The average distance between the <b>attained</b> <b>pose</b> and the desired location was 2. 7 cm. Average distance C-space between the <b>attained</b> <b>pose</b> and the desired location was 3. 65 degrees. The research suggests that the robotic framework presented has the potential to fulfill the main hardware and motion requirements of an autonomous indoor phenotyping robot, and can generate desired collision-free robot arm motion...|$|E

40|$|Positioning an eye-in-hand {{robotic system}} {{with respect to}} a static target is a {{challenging}} research problem since it involves recognition of the object and the desired pose at which alignment is to occur, planning a trajectory for the robot to <b>attain</b> this <b>pose,</b> and careful calibration of the system and the environment. In this paper we introduce a unified framework based on image morphing, to address the above problems and apply it to the task of translational and rotational alignment of an eye-in-hand system to planar objects or planar projections of 3 D objects. In our method the desired manipulator pose for each object is defined and stored as a view of the object taken from this pose. The identity of an unknown object in the workspace is established by morphing its image to the views in the database, and using a quantification of the morph as a dissimilarity measure. The synthetic images generated during the morph are used guide an eye-in-hand system to the desired pose. The framewo [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel method for fully {{automated}} exterior calibration of a 2 D scanning laser range sensor that <b>attains</b> accurate <b>pose</b> {{with respect to}} a fixed 3 D reference frame. This task is crucial for applications that attempt to recover self-consistent 3 D environment maps and produce accurately registered or fused sensor data. A key contribution of our approach lies in the design of a class of calibration target objects whose pose can be reliably recognized from a single observation (i. e. from one 2 D range data stripe). Unlike other techniques, we do not require simultaneous camera views or motion of the sensor, making our approach simple, flexible and environment-independent. In this paper we illustrate the target geometry and derive the relationship between a single 2 D range scan and the 3 D sensor pose. We describe an algorithm for closed-form solution of the 6 DOF pose that minimizes an algebraic error metric, and an iterative refinement scheme that subsequently minimizes geometric error. Finally, we report performance and stability of our technique on synthetic and real data sets, and demonstrate accuracy within 1 degree of orientation and 3 cm of position in a realistic configuration. ...|$|R

30|$|When a joint is locked, a 6 -DOF {{manipulator}} {{will decrease}} to a 5 -DOF manipulator, which has insufficient degrees of freedoms {{to make its}} end-effector freely move in 3 D space. The kinematics, workspace, and trajectory planning are much more different from the original 6 -DOF manipulator. There {{are two types of}} methods to solve the inverse kinematics of such manipulator with single locked joint: One is to directly solve the 5 -DOF manipulator; the other is to construct a new 6 -DOF manipulator with a virtual joint. For the former, there are various methods [9, 10] to obtain the inverse solution of the manipulator. The methods based on vector algebra and linear transform [11 – 13] are always used to solve the inverse solution of a manipulator with insufficient degrees of freedoms. Such manipulator can not <b>attain</b> some given <b>pose</b> (attitude and position), i.e., there will be no any rational inverse solutions for some desired pose. Correspondingly, there will be no rational trajectory to achieve the desired pose. If single variable arc tangent function [14, 15] is used in solving the joint angles, one solution of arc tangent function may be lost.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of its}} climate strategy, the EU aims at {{increasing}} the share of electricity from renewable energy sources (RES-E) in overall electricity generation. <b>Attaining</b> this target <b>poses</b> a considerable challenge as the electricity sector is “locked” into a carbon-intensive system, which hampers the adoption of RES-E technologies. Electricity generation, transmission and distribution grids as well as storage and demand response are subject to important path dependences, which put existing, non-renewable energy sources at an advantage. This paper examines how an EU framework for RES-E support policies should be designed to facilitate a carbon lock-out. For this purpose, we specify the major technological, economic and institutional barriers to RES-E. For each of the barriers, a policy review is carried out which assesses the performance of existing policy instruments and identifies needs for reform. The review reveals several shortcomings: while policies targeting generation are widely in place, measures to address barriers associated with electricity grids, storage and demand are still in their infancy {{and have to be}} extended. Moreover, the implementation of policies has been fragmented across EU Member States. In this respect, national policies should be embedded into an integrated EU-wide planning of the RES-E system with overarching energy scenarios and partially harmonized policy rules...|$|R
40|$|Future {{astrophysics}} missions {{will require}} the construction of larger space telescopes, which poses numerous technical challenges including: mirror stability, packaging and deployment, active mirror control, and segment actuator failure mitigation. To address these challenges, this dissertation {{presents the results of}} four research projects. The first project considers the problems of packaging and deployment and mirror stability, presenting a segmented mirror architecture in which the segments are connected edgewise by mechanisms analogous to damped springs. For low to intermediate stiffnesses, the stiffness and damping contributions from the mechanisms improve both the natural frequency and disturbance response of the segmented mirror. At higher stiffnesses, the segmented mirror performs comparably to or better than a monolith, with the modular design enabling on-orbit assembly and scalability. The second project addresses the mirror stability challenge for cryogenic mirrors in particular, presenting flux-pinning mechanisms designed to increase the mirror stiffness and damping. These mechanisms consist of a collection of magnets and superconductors, and like flexures, preferentially allow motion in specific degrees of freedom. With typical stiffness and damping values on the order of 5, 000 N/m and 5 kg/s, respectively, these mechanisms provide modest improvements to the mirror performance. The third project investigates improvements to mirror control algorithms for active space telescopes at L 2. I show that the wavefront for these telescopes can be controlled passively by introducing scheduling constraints and describe the implementation of a predictive con- troller designed to prevent the wavefront error from exceeding a desired threshold. This controller outperforms simpler algorithms even with substantial model error, achieving a lower wavefront error without requiring significantly more corrections. The fourth project discusses how the effects of actuator failures can be mitigated by using the remaining segment actuators to optimize the pose of each affected segment. When one actuator fails, the affected segment can still <b>attain</b> a <b>pose</b> with zero wavefront error by exploiting the rotational symmetry of the primary. Monte Carlo simulations of many failures randomly distributed across an initially well-phased segmented primary show that more than 10 % of the actuators must fail before the root-mean-square wavefront error degrades significantly. 2019 - 05 - 2...|$|R
40|$|The kinetic schemes, {{also known}} as Boltzmann schemes {{are based on the}} moment-method-strategy, where an upwind scheme is first {{developed}} at the Boltzmann level and after taking suitable moments we arrive at an upwind scheme for the governing Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. The Kinetic Flux Vector Splitting (KFVS) scheme, which belongs to the family of kinetic schemes is being extensively used to compute inviscid as well as viscous flows around many complex configurations of practical interest over the past two decades. To resolve many flow features accurately, like suction peak, minimising the loss in stagnation pressure, shocks, slipstreams, triple points, vortex sheets, shock-shock interaction, mixing layers, flow separation in viscous flows require an accurate and low dissipative numerical scheme. The first order KFVS method even though is very robust suffers from the problem of having much more numerical diffusion than required, resulting in very badly smearing of the above features. However, numerical dissipation can be reduced considerably by using higher order kinetic schemes. But they require more points in the stencil and hence consume more computational time and memory. The second order schemes require flux or slope limiters in the neighbourhood of discontinuities to avoid spurious and physically meaningless wiggles or oscillations in pressure, temperature or density. The limiters generally restrict the residue fall in second order schemes while in first order schemes residue falls up to machine zero. Further, pressure and density contours or streamlines are much smoother for first order accurate schemes than second order accurate schemes. A question naturally arises about the possibility of constructing first order upwind schemes which retain almost all advantages mentioned above {{while at the same time}} crisply capture the flow features. In the present work, an attempt has been made to address the above issues by developing yet another kinetic scheme, known as the low dissipative modified KFVS (m-KFVS) method based on modified CIR (MCIR) splitting with molecular velocity dependent dissipation control function. Different choices for the dissipation control function are presented. A detailed mathematical analysis and the underlying physical arguments behind these choices are presented. The expressions for the m-KFVS fluxes are derived. For one of the choices, the expressions for the split fluxes are similar to the usual first order KFVS method. The mathematical properties of 1 D m-KFVS fluxes and the eigenvalues of the corresponding flux Jacobians are studied numerically. The analysis of numerical dissipation is carried out both at Boltzmann and Euler levels. The expression for stability criterion is derived. In order to be consistent with the interior scheme, modified solid wall and outer boundary conditions are derived by extending the MCIR idea to boundaries. The cell-centred finite volume method based on m-KFVS is applied to several standard test cases for 1 D, 2 D and 3 D inviscid flows. In the case of subsonic flows, the m-KFVS method produces much less numerical entropy compared to first order KFVS method and the results are comparable to second order accurate q-KFVS method. In transonic and supersonic flows, m-KFVS generates much less numerical dissipation compared to first order KFVS and even less compared to q-KFVS method. Further, the m-KFVS method captures the discontinuities more sharply with contours being smooth and near second order accuracy has been achieved in smooth regions, by still using first order stencil. Therefore, the numerical dissipation generated by m-KFVS is considerably reduced by suitably choosing the dissipation control variables. The Euler code based on m-KFVS method almost takes the same amount of computational time as that of KFVS method. Although, the formal accuracy is of order one, the m-KFVS method resolves the flow features much more accurately compared to first order KFVS method but the numerical dissipation generated by m-KFVS method may not be minimal. Hence, the dissipation control vector is in general not optimal. If we can find the optimal dissipation control vector then we will be able to achieve the minimal dissipation. In the present work, the above objective is <b>attained</b> by <b>posing</b> the minimisation of numerical dissipation in m-KFVS method as an optimal control problem. Here, the control variables are the dissipation control vector. The discrete form of the cost function, which is to be minimised is considered as the sum of the squares of change in entropy at all cells in the computational domain. The number of control variables is equal to the total number of cells or finite volumes in the computational domain, as each cell has only one dissipation control variable. In the present work, the minimum value of cost function is obtained by using gradient based optimisation method. The sensitivity gradients of the cost function with respect to the control variables are obtained using discrete adjoint approach. The discrete adjoint equations for the optimisation problem of minimising the numerical dissipation in m-KFVS method applied to 2 D and 3 D Euler equations are derived. The method of steepest descent is used to update the control variables. The automatic differentiation tool Tapenade has been used to ease the development of adjoint codes. The m-KFVS code combined with discrete adjoint code is applied to several standard test cases for inviscid ﬂows. The test cases considered are, low Mach number flows past NACA 0012 airfoil and two element Williams airfoil, transonic and supersonic flows past NACA 0012 airfoil and finally, transonic flow past Onera M 6 wing. Numerical results have shown that the m-KFVS-adjoint method produces even less numerical dissipation compared to m-KFVS method and hence results in more accurate solution. The m-KFVS-adjoint code takes more computational time compared to m-KFVS code. The present work demonstrates that it is possible to achieve near second order accuracy by formally first order accurate m-KFVS scheme while retaining advantages of first order accurate methods...|$|R
40|$|It {{is without}} {{doubt that the}} 2008 Olympic Games in Peking {{will be remembered as}} the most grandiose, most {{spectacular}} and most expensive sport manifestation ever organized. Ratings are uniform: {{it will be very difficult}} to <b>attain</b> a standard <b>posed</b> by Peking in any recent time. Again, through the organization of this manifestation, China resurfaced as a powerful, wealthy and modern country, ready for the challenges of the 21 st century. However, a shadow is cast upon China, in spite of its economic power, due to the country's autocratic political system. China's lack of democracy, human rights and liberties and position of minorities have provoked a harsh criticism among the Western countries, reflected at the time when China was granted Olympic games for 2008. Since then, the criticism continues especially directed at the decision of the Olympic committee, with several calls to boycott the Games itself. Anti-Chinese rallies were intensified this spring, when the Olympic torch started its way from Greece to Peking. Thousands of demonstrators worldwide- defenders of the Tibet's freedom- have tried to stop the carriers of the torch, trying to put out 'the eternal flame' and disable its route to the final destination. The torch has changed its route many times in order to deceive the protestors and takeover was also a subject to change and many manipulations. In any case, the broadcasted scenes of conflict between the demonstrators and Chinese official escorts and citizens, charged with emotions at both sides, will remain as a recall of the Olympic Games 2008 for a long time. Regardless of the possible justified cause of this protest, in the worldwide broadcasted scenes for many months there was a totally paradoxical change of roles: the Olympic flame, as well as the idea, China has defended as its own, as a highest value and also as a source and holiness of its own past and identity, while the Europeans, on whose territory that same idea and values were once created, attacked fiercely those same notions. How are we to understand these contradictory images? How it came about that China experience itself as heiress of the Olympic tradition and how it happened that the pride of the Chinese nation concentrated in the flame, be hurt by the attempts of the European demonstrators to put it out? Modern Olympic Games, founded in 1896, presented itself as one of the echoes of centuries' long fascination of the Antique era experienced by the Westerners. This phenomenon of the Antique admiration has brought about a new redefinition of the European past and civilization ranging from abandoning Biblical story and gradual building of the secular one which we came to call modern history. In that modern history, Ancient Greece and Rome became the two main references about origin. The same process has lead to formation of national states, which, besides making their own national history, had in common the perceived joint origin in the Ancient Greece. Of course, Gauls, Franks or Germanics had very little in common with the ancient Greeks; the common characteristics of the modern European nations are precisely the invention of the Antique images and a firm belief in it as a source of the cultural identity. For instance, the French and British have believed, at the end of the 18 th century, they could trace their origin back to the Ancient Greece; in addition, they have managed to successfully 'sell' the story to the modern Greeks and afterward to the rest of the world. In this sense, it is not possible not to see the parallel with the modern China. Adopting the Western model in almost everything, from communist ideology as its first phase of westernization, to liberal economy, and finally to Olympic Games, China implicitly adopts the European story on origin. Critiques however, do not clearly see the range of this discrepancy that the country with such rich tradition has made in the last several decades toward the West. An arrogant colonial European mind holds it understandable that China accepts the Olympic tradition, since it wants to 'look like us'. This same arrogance fails to question, for example, if a golden medal in gymnastics that He Kexin won at this Games, is a victory for China or the West...|$|R
