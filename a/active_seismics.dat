40|$|Active seismic {{measurements}} were {{an important part}} of geophysical traverses on the Antarctic ice sheet {{as far back as the}} 1920 s. These methods lost their leading role for ice thickness measurements to much faster ground-based and airborne radar surveys because of the considerable logistical effort necessary for seismic data acquisition. However, new achievements with a vibrator source in <b>active</b> <b>seismics</b> (vibroseis for short) could open new prospects and foster future geological and glaciological surveys in Antarctica and Greenland and on ice caps and glaciers...|$|E
40|$|The cold alpine saddle Colle Gnifetti, Monte Rosa, Swiss-Italian Alps resembles {{very much}} polar and subpolar ice masses {{in terms of}} glaciological conditions. It has been the site for several ice-core {{drilling}} campaigns over more than 20 years to determine paleoclimatological and glaciological conditions. To investigate the feasibility of geophysical methods for improved characterization of ice masses surrounding borehole and ice-core sites, a combined active reflection seismic and ground-penetrating radar pilot study {{has been carried out}} in summer 2008. Aims are the characterization of density, internal layering, seismic and radar wave speed and attenuation, identification of anisotropic features (like crystal orientation or bubble content and shape). Here we present the overall setup and first results. Seismic and GPR profiles were centered on an existing borehole location covering the full ice thickness of 62 m. <b>Active</b> <b>seismics</b> was carried out with 24 -channel 3 -m spacing recording, using a Seismic Impulse Source System (SISSY) along two profiles parallel and perpendicular to the ice-flow direction. The same profiles were complemented with GPR measurements utilizing 250, 500 MHz frequencies. Additionally, circular profiles with 250, 500 and 800 MHz were carried out circumferencing the borehole to detect anisotropic features...|$|E
40|$|Since 1981 three wells {{have been}} drilled to depths of between 2. 0 and 2. 6 km in the Carnmenellis granite, Cornwall, England {{in order to}} create a HDR {{geothermal}} system. These wells are separated by between 150 and 300 m and have been hydraulically connected by massive injections of both water and viscous gel (50 cpoise). Passive microseismic monitoring of the hydraulic stimulation and circulation experiments has been used since 1982 to determine the size and structure of the reservoir, and monitor its growth. The active seismic survey techniques of cross-hole seismics and vertical seismic profiling (VSP) have been introduced to complement the passive microseismic monitoring in characterizing the reservoir. The cross-hole seismic surveys indicate that the microseismicity defines the area of joint dilation. The attenuation of high frequencies in the region of microseismicity suggests that the reservoir is composed of a complex zone of cracks rather than a single large fracture. VSP surveys also show a good agreement between the microseismically defined reservoir and seismic signal attenuation. Recent improvements in hardware, computer processing and interpretation indicate that <b>active</b> <b>seismics</b> will play an increasingly important part in mapping and understanding geothermal reservoirs. 11 figs., 10 refs...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{relations between}} <b>seismic</b> gaps in <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> zones and occurrence of middle-size earthquakes by using of a microearthquake catalog compiled for 25 years by Tottori Observatory which belongs to Research Center for Earthquake Prediction, Disaster Prevention Research Institute, Kyoto University. Our study sites are <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> zones of Tottori region, Tottori-Shimane border region and Yamasaki Fault {{region in the}} Inner zone of Southwest Japan. We examined preceding seismic activity in and around a focal area of 10 middle-size earthquakes in the <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> zones. The result is that in most cases a middle-size earthquake(s) occurred in a seismic gap in the <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> zones, {{some of which were}} preceded by small-size earthquakes.

40|$|Local {{earthquakes}} (passive seismic) tomography (LET) is a {{well established}} tool for the imaging of the sub-surface structure. Alternative to <b>active</b> <b>seismics,</b> the main advantages of using natural sources are the better sounding in deeper portions of the upper crust, the relatively low cost, and the direct availability of S-waves. The main drawback is the achievable model resolution, which {{is limited by the}} density of the seismic network and the distribution of elastic sources, rather than the elastic wave frequency. Recently, 4 D variations (in space and time) of velocity anomalies have been recognized in active volcanoes (Patanè et al., 2006) and normal faulting systems and ascribed to the medium response to transient geological processes, like dyke intrusions or fluid pressure increase on fault planes. In this paper we show how LET contributes to the imaging of the upper crust in a very attractive region like the Val d’Agri in southern Italy, which hosts both significant oil fields and seismogenic structures. We show that LET allows to improve the definition of the crust structure, at depths larger than those sampled by conventional seismic profiles, and detect the space-time dependency of elastic properties in response to local variations of fluid pressur...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRegarding the {{exploitation}} of natural resources, storage of waste or subsurface construction, there is an increasing need to obtain comprehensive knowledge about the subsurface and its temporal changes. We investigate {{the possibility of a}} passive monitoring using ambient seismic noise, which is cheap and continuous compared to <b>active</b> <b>seismics.</b> We work with data acquired with a seismic network in Ketzin (Germany) where 67 271 tons of CO 2 were injected from 2008 June until 2013 August into a saline aquifer at a depth of about 650 m. Monitoring the expansion of the CO 2 plume is essential for the characterization of the reservoir as well as the detection of potential leakage. By cross-correlating about 4 [*]yr of passive seismic data in a frequency range of 0. 05 – 4. 5 [*]Hz we found periodic velocity variations with a period of approximately 1 [*]yr that cannot be caused by the CO 2 injection. The prominent direction of the noise wavefield indicates a wind farm as the dominant source providing the temporally stable noise field. This spacial stability excludes variations of the noise source distribution as a cause of spurious velocity variations. Based on an amplitude decrease associated with time windows towards later parts of the coda, we show that the variations must be generated in the shallow subsurface. A comparison to groundwater level data reveals a direct correlation between depth of the groundwater level and the seismic velocity. The influence of ground frost on the seismic velocities is documented by a sharp increase of velocity when the maximum daily temperature stays below 0 [*]°C. Although the observed periodic changes and the changes due to ground frost affect only the shallow subsurface, they mask potential signals of material changes from the reservoir depths...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, various {{systems of}} seismic {{protection}} {{are applied to}} assure seismic protection of buildings and structures, located in earthquake areas. The greatest prevalence and popularity has been attained by the systems of <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> protection. In this article, the authors study the efficiency of application of an <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> protection system by taking high-damping rubber elastomeric isolators as an example.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of high strength material construction in highly <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> regions is magnifying {{the importance of}} high performance structural design. High strength concrete is becoming popular because it offers the potential for cost savings in construction due to reduced member dimensions and the capability to accommodate rapid construction schedules, and because it enhances the service life of a structure. High strength concrete is commonly used in minimizing the column sizes in the lower floors of high-rise buildings. In spite of the advantages offered by high strength concrete, lack of design provisions in building codes hinders {{the widespread use of}} the material, especially in zones of seismic activity. Another significant concern for the design of buildings in highly <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> regions is the brittle nature of plain high strength concrete under compression. This suggests that the inelastic deformability of high strength concrete members may not be sufficient for use in <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> regions.

The case study of the application of <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> methods illustrates limitations imposed by the use of relatively simple systems in the field.
