The aim of this study were to analyze the product quality of samples and to know the correlation between independent variables (chitosan concentration and storage time) against dependent variables of product quality from chemical aspects (moisture content, water activity), microbiological (TPC, Staphylococcus aureus) <b>and</b> <b>organoleptic</b> <b>test</b> (appearance, odor, flavor and texture). The quality of dried-salted anchovy was refer to SNI 01 - 2708 - 1992. The present work of this research employed a laboratory-experimental method with two factors and design as Randomized Complete Block. The first factor was three levels of chitosan concentration (0. 0...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study pasteurized milk quality produced by UD. Gading Mas on pH, Acidity, alcohol test and TPC during 5 days storage in refrigerator. On first day showed that  weight mass 1, 06 (w/w); fat content 2, 00 (g/ 100 g),  protein content 3, 02   (g/ 100 g), Zn 1, 67 ppm, Cu< 0, 005 ppm, Pb 0, 02 ppm,  As  0, 0120 ppm, Hg< 0, 0002 ppm, Sn 1, 60 ppm dan Cd < 0, 001 ppm <b>and</b> <b>organoleptic</b> <b>test</b> included color, flavor and taste were normal. Pasteurized milk characteristic during 5 days refrigeration for pH were 6, 57; 6, 58; 6, 73; 6, 60 and 6, 50 respectively. Acidity were 1, 147 %, 0, 145 %, 0, 145 %, 0, 157 %, 0, 156 % and 0, 175   % respectively. TPC were 6, 16 x 101, 1, 2. 104; 3, 15. 104, 0, 42. 106 and 3, 5. 108 respectively. It concluded that pasteurized milk produced by UD Gading Mas fulfilled SNI quality standard based on weight mass, pH, acidity, fat, protein, heavy metal content, <b>organoleptic</b> <b>test</b> <b>and</b> TPC.   Keywords: pasteurized milk, quality, refrigerato...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the effect of hydrocooling and storage on the quality and shelf life of gendot Chili. This study was conducted in Post Harvest Laboratory and Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta. Research was arranged in a completely randomized design (CRD). The first factor is Hydrocooling treatment which consists with and without hydrocooling. The second factor is storage which consist three kind of storage, there are ice box, cooler, and refrigerator. Chili was kept in the storage for 20 days. Parameters of observation were weight losses, damage percentage, fruit hardness, moisture content, vitamin C, reducing sugar, microbiological <b>and</b> <b>organoleptic</b> <b>test.</b> Result showed that hydrocooling treatment was not signicantly effect to the quality of chili. However, hydrocooling treatment is affecting to moisture, Vitamin C, and reducing sugar contents. Storage rooms was not significantly effecting to the quality of chili. There is any interactions between hydrocooling treatment and storage on moisture content, Vitamin C contents, and reducing sugar content. </p...|$|R
40|$|Research {{aimed at}} knowing kinds, concentration, and {{application}} time of botanical fungicides on development of anthracnose in vitro and in vivo, <b>and</b> <b>organoleptic</b> <b>test</b> on postharvest banana. The in vitro test was arranged by factorial based on Completely Randomized Design with kinds of the fungicides, i. e., leaves extract of neem, soursop, or pepper betle {{as the first}} factor and concentration as the second one. The in vivo one was designed with Split-Split Plot Design, as main plot, subplot, and sub-subplot were kinds of the fungicides, injury or inoculation, and application time, respectively. Result of the research pointed out that leaves extract of pepper betle 30 % had the same ability to suppress anthracnose fungus in vitro with benomyl. However, the leaves extract of neem 30 % given before injury or inoculation was the best treatment to decrease the disease as 63. 13 %. The botanical fungicides did not affect aroma, color, and taste of banana...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{profile of}} baked 'kemplang' made from {{material}} mixtures of tenggiri bone stock and palm fruit had been investigated. Baked kemplang {{is a type}} of traditional food crispy at Palembang, South Sumatera. The research was canducted on factorial completely randomized design with two treatment factors (i. e. tenggiri bone stock and palm fruit) with three replications. There are four levels respectively for tenggiri bone stock: 0, 20, 40 and 60 percent; and for palm fruit: 0, 15, 30 and 45 percent. The quality was expressed by measured parameters consisted of moisture content, density, porosity, degree of kemplang's expansion <b>and</b> <b>organoleptic</b> <b>test</b> (taste, color <b>and</b> texture). The result showed that palm fruit and tenggiri bone stock had significant effect on the moisture content, density, porosity, degree of expansion <b>and</b> its <b>organoleptic</b> properties. Raw baked kemplang moisture content was ranged 8. 01 to 12. 13 percent (db), density 0. 40 to 0. 73 g/ml, pore diameter 0. 197 to 0. 333 mm, degree of expansion 43. 49 to 153. 77 percent. The product was given <b>organoleptic</b> <b>test</b> score two to four wich was described as like to dislike for taste, texture and color. There are relationship between density (D) of raw baked kemplang to its degree of expansion (E) after baking,and valid to be expressed by the equation E= 287. 34 - 309. 47 (D) ...|$|R
