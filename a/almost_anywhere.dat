Bacteria and archaea are almost always microscopic, while a number of eukaryotes are also microscopic, {{including}} most protists, some fungi, {{as well as some}} micro-animals and plants. Viruses are generally regarded as not living and therefore not considered as microorganisms, although a subfield of microbiology is virology, the study of viruses.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{traditional}} piercing techniques, modern body adornment includes variant {{techniques such}} as pocketing and flesh stapling, although as of 2007 these were still not widely made available by piercers. In the first of these, a scalpel opens the skin or mucous membranes, into which the larger end {{of a piece of}} jewellery or—if using a bar—two ends are inserted. These kinds of piercings may be difficult to remove, as fibrous tissue can form around the end or ends of the jewellery or the implanted tube into which the jewellery is placed. When a bar is used, pocketing looks quite similar to flesh stapling. The latter technique is frequently done {{in the form of a}} ladder. Modern body piercing practices also include dermal anchoring or dermal piercing, which combines piercing and implantation to create a single point of opening in the body (whereas pocketing creates two) to permit one end of the jewellery to show above the surface of the skin. While this technique can be performed <b>almost</b> <b>anywhere</b> on the body, as of 2007 it was popularly done between the eyes, on the chest, or on the finger, to simulate a ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic concept}} of SaGa Frontier {{is based on}} its Free Scenario System, in which one can play as any of seven {{different}} protagonists, all of whom exist in the same setting: a solar system known as The Regions, a group of planets, {{each with its own}} culture, game-level of technology, and form of magic. The game is considered non-linear, in that from the beginning many of the characters are free to go <b>almost</b> <b>anywhere</b> and interact with almost anyone. Travel through most of the Regions is easy due to inter-regional ships traveling regularly between them. The player controls the protagonist on the field screen, a set of interconnecting pre-rendered backgrounds, and is able to speak with a slew of other characters in order to gather information, recruit party members, and initiate quests. Each character has his or her own storyline and a main quest to fulfill, but there are also several optional quests that any of the characters can participate in. Some of the main characters even encounter each other during their quests. The storyline of each character also changes depending on who is chosen, what is said in conversation, what events have already occurred, and who the protagonist has in his or her party, a concept first introduced in Romancing SaGa 2.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in May 1956, Major Bruce, Captain Taylor and Sergeant Zweiner {{headed to}} the Air Transport Squadron Five (VR-5) at NAS North Island and spent countless hours {{examining}} the Grumman TF-1 Trader. Originally, the TF-1 Trader was a carrier onboard delivery aircraft, whose primary mission was the consignment of personnel, mail, and critical parts for the naval carrier vessel itself. It was capable of launching off every size of naval carrier, even its smallest, in the United States Fleet. Detachments of VR-5 were dispersed worldwide everywhere US Naval carriers were sent. This proved the feasibility of the TF-1, assuring of it being potentially accessible <b>almost</b> virtually <b>anywhere</b> in the world.|$|R

5000|$|Postcolonial SocietiesJohn has a {{particular}} interest in postcolonial societies, specifically South Africa, where the Comaroffs began their research. John found that although anthropology was not in itself radical, [...] "It created a base from which one could think radical thoughts and from which one could ask questions {{about the nature of}} South African society, which was <b>almost</b> impossible <b>anywhere</b> else" [...] (John and Jean Comaroff, personal communication, 15 November 2008). When John and his wife first started their research as undergraduate students, apartheid was still widespread in South Africa.

50|$|The Carrier {{exists in}} orbit around the Earth {{but at the same}} time {{continuously}} sails through the higher dimensions of the Wildstorm multiverse. It is capable of opening doors between any two points in space, allowing quick access from the Carrier to anywhere on Earth, as well as to the past, future and to alternate universes. While it is also itself capable of travelling <b>almost</b> literally <b>anywhere,</b> the Carrier stays tied to Earth orbit so that whoever left it there can come back to collect it. It is reluctant to leave although will do so if convinced that it is necessary. Its talents have been used on many missions, such as to infiltrate (physically entering) a vast biological lifeform threatening Earth and to actually evacuate Earth itself when another situation endangers it.|$|R

This paper introduces a new "pinball" framework of new media's impact on relationships with customers and identifies key new media phenomena which companies should take into account when managing their relationships with customers in the new media universe. For each phenomenon, we identify challenges for researchers and managers which relate to (a) the understanding of consumer behavior, (b) the use of new media to successfully manage customer interactions, and (c) the effective measurement of customers' activities and outcomes...|$|R
25|$|Strawberries {{are popular}} and {{rewarding}} plants {{to grow in}} the domestic environment, be it for consumption or exhibition purposes, <b>almost</b> <b>anywhere</b> in the world. The best time to plant is in late summer or spring. Plant in full sun or dappled shade, and in somewhat sandy soil. The addition of manure and a balanced fertilizer aids strong growth. Alternatively they can be planted in pots or special planters using compost. Fibre mats placed under each plant will protect fruits from touching the ground, and will act as a weed barrier.|$|E

5000|$|Its {{originator}} {{and most}} fervent defender, Sheikh Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali Al Thani explains how {{the museum was}} aimed at filling a void in modern Arab art in Qatar: [...] "Since the collection had increased its representation of periods and styles, I began planning to make it part of a specific project. At the time, I {{did not know of}} any museum of Arab art from the 19th century to today. As a painter and photographer — simply put, as an artist — I was passionate about modern and contemporary art and artistic movements in the Arab world. But only in Egypt could you find quality museums devoted to the history of Arab art and its different forms of expression. Otherwise there was <b>almost</b> nothing <b>anywhere.</b> So instead of continuing in the darkness, I decided to light a light".|$|R
40|$|New {{communication}} and information technologies {{are probably the}} main feature associated with the phenomenon of globalisation. Such technologies allow people to be in contact with <b>almost</b> anyone <b>anywhere,</b> raising debates about both their benefits and negative consequences. It is often argued that they contribute to increasing the domination of a few major languages chosen to mediate communication, {{at the expense of}} more minor languages {{in terms of the number}} of speakers and social status. On the contrary, it is also argued that they allow speakers of minority languages to be in contact with one another and create social networks that may promote the survival, birth, or spread of such languages. The facilitated use of languages over large areas of the world may trigger language differentiation, eventually contributing to the rise of different dialects, or even languages. Among the benefits associated with new technologies, we realise that they give us access to immense language corpora that often reflect language differentiation. </p...|$|R
40|$|It is our {{pleasure}} {{to welcome you}} to this 7 th International Symposium on Computer Simulation in Biomechanics.
