40|$|Abstract — Industrial {{applications}} often impose hard {{requirements on}} {{the precision of}} autonomous vehicle systems. As a consequence industrial <b>Automatically</b> <b>Guided</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (AGV) systems still use high-cost infrastructure based positioning solutions. In this {{paper we propose a}} map based localization method that fulfills the requirements on precision and repeatability, typical for industrial application scenarios. The proposed method- Normal Distributions Transform Monte Carlo Localization (NDT-MCL) is based on a well established probabilistic framework. In a novel contribution, we formulate the MCL localization approach using the Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) as an underlying representation for both map and sensor data. By relaxing the hard discretization assumption imposed by grid-map models and utilizing the piecewise continuous NDT representation the proposed algorithm achieves substantially improved accuracy and repeatability. The proposed NDT-MCL algorithm is evaluated using offline data sets from both a laboratory and a real-world industrial environments. Additionally, we report a comparison of the proposed algorithm to grid-based MCL and to a commercial localization system when used in a closed-loop with the control system of an AGV platform. In all tests the proposed algorithm is demonstrated to provide performance superior to that of standard grid-based MCL and comparable to the performance of a commercial infrastructure based positioning system.

Arranged equipment, such as conveyors or machines, includes the need to model and determine motion paths for moving objects like forklifts or <b>automatically</b> <b>guided</b> <b>vehicles,</b> so that the simulation framework is able to navigate all vehicles across those motion paths. After analyzing first scenarios, the user often carries out layout changes in the simulation model, e. g. moving, adding or deleting equipment.

40|$|The {{search for}} more {{flexibility}} {{in all parts of}} industrial manufacturing increasingly affects material handling and distribution.

Efforts of research institutes and manufacturers aspire to develop vehicles without any guidance line, so-called non-guided vehicles. Thereby a special look out is to be drawn to the localization aspect. In most cases this unit is realised by using dead-reckoning systems in combination with various other methods of position detection.

40|$|International audienceFlexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS), {{in which}} the use of <b>Automatically</b> <b>Guided</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (AGVs) is typical, are a growing trend in many {{industrial}} scenarios. A novel, distributed, algorithmic approach to the execution control of activities (work-center oriented) is introduced in this paper, as is, in an integrated way, transportation (AGV oriented) scheduling. The relationship between jobs, modeled as processes, and work centers, modeled as resources, and sinks defines an undirected graph G representing a target Job-shop system. Analogously, the transportation performed by AGVs, also modeled as processes, and their corresponding physical paths, modeled as resources, {{can also be seen}} as a dual Job-shop problem. The new approach is based on the Scheduling by Edge Reversal (SER) graph dynamics which, from an initial acyclic orientation over edges, that can be defined via traditional and/or efficient heuristics, let jobs and AGVs proceed in a deadlock-and-starvation-free fashion without the need for any central coordination...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes {{two methods}} that give {{intelligence}} to <b>automatically</b> <b>guided</b> <b>vehicles</b> (AGVs). In order to drive AGVs autonomously, {{two types of}} problem occur to overcome. They are the AGV's navigation problem and collision avoidance problem. The first problem has been well known since 1980 's. A new method based on the feature scene recognition and acquisition is proposed. The sparse distributed memory neural network (SDM) is employed for the scene recognition and acquisition. The navigation route for the AGV is learnt by use of Q-learning depending on the recognized and acquired scenes. The second problem is described as mutual understanding of behaviors between AGVs. The method of mutual understanding is proposed by use of Q-learning.

40|$|We {{present a}} kind of {{agent-based}} simulation being a refinement of discrete-event simulation. It has a formal semantic for execution, which bases on object-based simulation, which itself is basing on discrete-event simulation. Our agent-based simulation contains distribution of the simulated system in active entities (agents) and passive entities (objects). Agents have an external (physical) {{as well as an}} internal (mental) state. In simulation there is an environmental simulator, managing the environment, which is the objects and the external agent states. We also have an agent simulator for each agent, managing the internal agent state. Simulation cycles, whereby the environmental simulator computes the events for the current cycle, does changes in the environment and sends perceptions to each agent simulator. Agent simulators compute internal events for the current cycle, do changes to the internal state and send taken actions to the environmental simulator. Agent-based simulation bases on object-based simulation, which itself bases on discrete-event simulation. One can transform an agent-based simulation model into an equivalent object-based model, which one can transform into an equivalent discrete-event simulation model. So, agent-based simulation is indeed a refinement of discrete-event simulation. We present a UML-based specification language to specify a concrete agent-based simulation system visually. This language uses reaction rules to specify the behaviour of simulation. We present an AORML-based specification language as well, which allows more naturally modelling, but is not useable for automatically processing because of insufficient tool support. We use the example of <b>Automatically</b> <b>Guided</b> <b>Vehicles</b> intensively, because it is very suitable to demonstrate agent-based simulation. Further examples are elevator systems and queues in supermarkets. As proof of concept we implemented a simulation system, whose kernel is a Java program library. We used this system to simulate a complex system of <b>Automatically</b> <b>Guided</b> <b>Vehicles</b> with decentral control and to do studies on the efficiency of this system. Having a simulation system, which is visually modelled using the UML-based simulation language, one can generate a simulation model in the XML-based language XMI. Using XSL transformation this model can be transformed into Java code, which can be used by the simulator. So, we developed a system to transform a visually specified simulation model into a simulation program, which can be executed by the simulator...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Future {{transportation}} systems {{will require a}} number of drastic measures, mostly to lower traffic jams and air pollution in urban areas. <b>Automatically</b> <b>guided</b> <b>vehicles</b> capable of driving in a platoon fashion will represent an important feature of such systems. Platooning {{of a group of}} automated wheeled mobile robots relying on relative sensor information only is addressed in this paper. Each vehicle in the platoon must precisely follow the path of the vehicle in front of it and maintain the desired safety distance to that same vehicle. Vehicles have only distance and azimuth information to the preceding vehicle where no inter-vehicle communication is available. Following vehicles determine their reference positions and orientations based on estimated paths of the vehicles in front of them. Vehicles in the platoon are then controlled to follow the estimated trajectories. Then presented platooning control strategies are experimentally validated by experiments on a group of small-sized mobile robots and on a Pioneer 3 AT mobile robot. The results and robustness analysis show the proposed platooning approach applicability...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{characterizes the}} {{homotopy}} properties {{and the global}} topology of the space of positions of vehicles which are constrained to travel without intersecting on a network of paths. The space {{is determined by the}} number of vehicles and the network. Paths in the space correspond to simultaneous non-intersecting motions of all vehicles. The authors therefore focus on computing the homotopy type of the space, and show how {{to do so in the}} general case. Understanding the homotopy type of the space is the central issue in controlling the vehicles, as it gives a complete description of the distinct ways that vehicles may move safely on the network. The authors exhibit graphs, products of graphs, and amalgamations of products of graphs that are homotopy equivalent to the full configuration space, and are far simpler than might be expected. The results indicate how a control system for such a network of vehicles (such as a fleet of <b>automatically</b> <b>guided</b> <b>vehicles</b> <b>guided</b> by wires buried in a factory floor) may be implemented...|$|R

Hence border detection is based on ant colony optimization technique. Two borders at two sides of the road (as seen by a camera fixed on the vehicle) are tracked by two agent colonies: agents' moves are inspired by the behaviors of biological ants when trying to find the shortest path from nest to food. Reinforcement learning is done by pheromone updating based on some heuristic function and by changing the heuristic balancing parameters with the experience over the last tracked results. Shadow removal has also been introduced to increase robustness...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a robotic flowshop {{in which one}} type of product is to be repeatedly produced, and where transportation of the parts between the machines is performed by a robot. The identical parts cyclic scheduling problem is then to find a shortest cyclic schedule for the robot; i. e., a sequence of robot moves that can be infinitely repeated and that has minimum cycle time. This problem has been solved by Sethi et al. (1992) when m < 3. In this paper, we generalize their results by proving that the identical parts cyclic scheduling problem can be solved in time polynomial in m, where m denotes the number of. machines in the shop. In particular, we present a dynamic programming approach {{that allows us to}} solve the problem in 0 (m 3) time. Our analysis relies heavily on the concept of pyramidal permutation, a concept previously investigated in connection with the traveling salesman problem. Recently, scheduling problems arising in flexible man-ufacturing cells, flexible flowlines, and similar auto-mated production systems have received much attention in the literature. In such environments, transportation of the parts between the machines is usually performed by an automated material handling system, be it a conveyor, a pool of <b>automatically</b> <b>guided</b> <b>vehicles</b> (AGVs), or a robot. Much of the scheduling literature, however, has ignored the constraints placed by material handling devices on the efficiency of the productive system, either because these devices were not regarded as bottlenecks, or more prag-matically, for reasons of modeling simplicity. Only recently has material handling been paid special attention and been incorporated explicitly in scheduling models (see e. g. Blazewicz et al. 1991; Hall et al. 1994 a, 1995; Hall et al...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model and}} its simulation results of an agricultural vehicle electrohydraulic (E/H) steering system. The dynamic characteristics of an E/H steering system {{plays an important role}} in realizing accurate steering control for an <b>automatically</b> <b>guided</b> agricultural <b>vehicle.</b> E/H steering systems are typically nonlinear with large deadband, asymmetric flow gain, time delay, hysteresis, and saturation, which result in difficulties in the system analysis, design, and control. In this paper, a mathematical model has been developed for an E/H steering system. This model has taken the main components of the E/H steering system, including a PWM driver, an E/H proportional directional control valve, steering actuating cylinders, steering linkage, and wheel-ground interactions, into consideration. It was then linearized with assumptions of incompressible fluid, the zero lapped valve, and frictionless. This model has been validated via vehicle steering tests. A third order liner model with considering the deadband, saturation, and time delay could well approximate the dynamic response within the steering angle range of 15 to 15 degrees. The validated model was used to estimate the dynamic behaviors of E/H steering systems in steering controller design. Those parameters are critical for designing high performance steering controller...|$|R

40|$|As an example, {{the thesis}} proposes a {{real-time}} route guidance system to show how it supports other transportation services, which can then <b>automatically</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vehicles</b> by voice. It illustrates the system architecture and describes the establishment of each part. The concept of agent network is introduced {{to build up the}} system. Furthermore, a dynamic route algorithm is presented in brief. A communication system integrating the existing infrastructure is discussed and simulation results are provided to testify the applicability of the proposed wireless data communication system. Finally, the thesis sums up the contributions achieved and proposes some future works. For the communication network, the main challenging problems are the large scale of the network, the movement of vehicles that may cause the levity of the network structure, and the large demands on communication capacity. In order to solve these problems, the performance optimization technique is accredited {{as one of the most}} important techniques for such a large scale wireless sensor network. This thesis focuses on the research in the following aspects. First, the optimal combination of the duty cycle, one of the most important parameters, is introduced to optimize the system performance. A duty cycle optimization model is put forward based on calculating n-times reachable matrix. Now that the parameter optimization model can be boiled down to a NP-hard problem, an improved genetic algorithm is introduced to solve the problem. The computational procedure and efficiency are discussed, and simulation study based on a practical road network is given to illustrate the validity of the proposed method. Second, the topological structure optimization problem is formulated as a graph problem, while fulfilling random node-to-node communication demands. A new optimization method, called un-detour optimization, is proposed to optimize the topological structure based on the improved genetic algorithm. In addition, the approach is evaluated quantitatively by simulating community wireless sensor networks. The comparison results demonstrate that some significant performance advantages can be achieved by this approach. In addition, two important techniques required to build the new surveillance system are discussed in this thesis. (1) the sensors to collect traffic information; (2) the communication network to transmit information among all sensors and vehicles. In order to detect and track the moving objects, this thesis presents a creative background updating method, which can works effectively even for some complex circumstances. The image processing results show that this method can realize the segmentation of the moving objects. Due to the simple model and fast calculation speed, the method can satisfy the requirements of detecting and tracking traffic objects in real time and at a high speed. Additionally, the thesis designs a new kind of object detection and tracking algorithm based on the attributive combination of contour and color in order to deal with the occlusion problem to some extent. Some experiments have testified to the robustness and practicability of the proposed system. Nowadays, with the rapid development of economics and societies, transportation is playing a very important role in the balanced running of social and economic systems. However, urban traffic problems such as traffic accidents and traffic congestions are becoming more and more serious in almost all large cities in the world. This thesis is focused on a traffic surveillance system which collects and transmits real-time traffic information in a large city, which is one of the most important steps in solving the transportation problems above. Considering the drawbacks of current traffic surveillance system, a brand-new system with a distributed architecture is proposed based on the concept of sensor networks. Then, an intelligent sensor node using an embedded ARM chip and MCU is developed and software system is built up accordingly, including Linux operating system, hardware drivers, and so on. Finally, a simulation program proves the validity of the system. Shi, Xi. "September 2007. "Adviser: YangShong Xu.
