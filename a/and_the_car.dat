5|$|Barbara and Adam Maitland {{decide to}} spend their {{vacation}} decorating their idyllic Connecticut country home. As the two are driving home {{from a trip to}} town, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> plunges into a river. After they return home, Adam decides to retrace their steps as they can't recall how they got home. Upon stepping outside he's taken to a desert world with monstrous sandworms before being pulled back in by Barbara. Even though he had been gone for less than a minute Barbara claims he had been gone for over an hour. She and Adam notice that they now lack reflections and they discover a Handbook for the Recently Deceased and realize they did not survive the crash.|$|E
5|$|In June 1968, an {{automobile}} {{he was driving}} in southern France was hit by another vehicle, seriously injuring him and killing one of his passengers, {{the wife of the}} mission president. Romney then became co-president of a mission that had become demoralized and disorganized after the May 1968 general strike and student uprisings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> accident. With Romney rallying the others, the mission met its goal of 200baptisms for the year, the most in a decade. By the end of his stint in December 1968, he was overseeing the work of 175others. As a result of his experience there, Romney developed a lifelong affection for France and its people and has also remained fluent in French.|$|E
5000|$|In 1959, Chrysler {{started to}} {{advertise}} <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> new wedge-head [...] "B" [...] engines as [...] "Golden Lions" [...] <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> as [...] "Lion Hearted".

5|$|Johnston {{is driving}} along a quiet road, when his car is {{overtaken}} by Gunsche. Gunsche forces Johnston off the road, strangles him to death, and places {{a piece of}} wood—meant to resemble the Cross—inside Johnston's car, before setting him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> ablaze. The remains are later examined by Watts and Means; they cannot determine if the wood is the Cross or not. However, Watts finds Johnston's partially burnt diary, and reads an entry about his contacting Means. Suspecting betrayal, he expels Means from the Group immediately.|$|E
5|$|King County police, finally {{armed with}} a {{detailed}} description of their suspect as well as his car, posted fliers throughout the Seattle area. A composite sketch was printed in regional newspapers and broadcast on local television stations. Elizabeth Kloepfer, Ann Rule, a DES employee, and a UW psychology professor all recognized the profile, the sketch, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> and reported Bundy as a possible suspect; but detectives—who were receiving up to 200 tips per day—thought it unlikely that a clean-cut law student with no adult criminal record could be the perpetrator.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 1998 the RIRA left a car {{containing}} 500lb of home-made explosives in {{the centre}} of Omagh, County Tyrone. The bombers {{could not find a}} parking space near the intended target of the courthouse, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was left 400 metres away. As a result, three inaccurate telephone warnings were issued, and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) believed the bomb was located outside the courthouse. They attempted to establish a security cordon to keep civilians clear of the area, which inadvertently pushed people closer to the location of the bomb. Shortly after, the bomb exploded killing 29 people and injuring 220 others, in what became the single deadliest strike of the Troubles.|$|E

5|$|On 22 March 1990, Achebe {{was riding}} in a car to Lagos when an axle {{collapsed}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> flipped. His son Ikechukwu and the driver suffered minor injuries, but {{the weight of the}} vehicle fell on Achebe and his spine was severely damaged. He was flown to the Paddocks Hospital in Buckinghamshire, England, and treated for his injuries. In July doctors announced that although he was recuperating well, he was paralyzed from the waist down and would require the use of a wheelchair {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 1966, Nell {{was driving}} the family car with Harry as a passenger; {{they were going to}} the south coast of Queensland for a holiday. A tyre blew out <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> rolled on the Leichhardt Highway near Condamine. Murray was taken to Miles District Hospital with broken ribs. He had {{suffered}} heart trouble for some time, and the shock of the accident is believed to have caused his death the following day. Murray was interred at Mount Thompson Crematorium with full military honours after a funeral service at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|The next {{attack was}} on {{officers}} from the 9th Parachute Battalion on 28June. The officers were dining at a restaurant when two men of the Irgun approached and fired machine guns through the windows. One officer was killed outright while several others were wounded. The officers returned fire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> the gunmen were escaping in crashed; later examination revealed {{at least one of}} them had been wounded. On 19July two police officers on patrol in Haifa were shot in the back and killed. The following day the 3rd Parachute Brigade cordoned the area and imposed a night time curfew, which was not lifted until 30July.|$|E
5000|$|The {{greenhouse}} (or glasshouse) of a <b>car</b> comprises <b>the</b> windshield, rear <b>and</b> side windows, <b>the</b> pillars separating them (designated A-pillar, B-pillar and so on, {{starting from}} <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> front), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> roof.|$|R
50|$|Drift Factor is a {{drifting}} special {{with driver}} interviews, in-depth profiles on drifting <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> how-tos on starting in drifting.|$|R
50|$|Each car was powered {{individually}} by an underfloor auxiliary diesel engine, driving an AC alternator {{which would}} supply power for <b>the</b> air conditioning <b>and</b> lighting.

5|$|The {{station is}} near the Queens Borough Hall, the Queens Criminal Court, and the Kew-Forest School. It is also close to the Forest Hills Tower, which has housed Plaza College since 2014 and also {{contains}} administrative offices for FEMA; it formerly housed the headquarters of JetBlue Airways and a public relations office for Con Edison, but the JetBlue office has since moved to the Brewster Building in Long Island City. At {{the east end of}} Queens Borough Hall on 82nd Avenue, a retired IRT redbird, R33 car 9075, is on display. The Redbird car was formerly a visitor center for the Queens Borough Hall, but the visitor center closed in 2015 due to low patronage, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is now used as a landmark and for movie shoots.|$|E
5|$|To assist his endeavour, Shackleton {{adopted a}} mixed {{transport}} strategy, involving {{the use of}} Manchurian ponies as pack animals, {{as well as the}} more traditional dog-sledges. A specially adapted motor car was also taken. Although the dogs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> were used during the expedition for a number of purposes, the task of assisting the group that would undertake the march to the pole fell to the ponies. The size of Shackleton's four-man polar party was dictated by the number of surviving ponies; of the ten that were embarked in New Zealand, only four had survived the 1908 winter.|$|E
5|$|Tucker: The Man and His Dream was {{released}} in the United States on August 12, 1988, earning $3,709,562 in its opening weekend in 720 theaters. The film eventually grossed $19.65 million in US totals and was declared a box office bomb {{because it did not}} reimburse its $24 million production budget, despite positive reviews. Pocket Books published a novelization written by Robert Tine to coincide with the release of the film. Paramount Home Video released Tucker: The Man and His Dream on DVD in October 2000, which included audio commentary by Coppola, the 1948 promotional film Tucker: The Man <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Car</b> (with optional commentary by Coppola), as well as a making-of featurette, Under the Hood: Making Tucker.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{reaching}} {{the end of}} the second queue, guests were loaded into test cars. Upon dispatching from the loading dock, the car was brought through an accelerated hill climb. Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's anti-lock braking system was turned off <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process. The anti-lock brakes were then turned back on and a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference. Then, the cars were brought through 3 environmental chambers: a heat chamber, a cold chamber, and a corrosion chamber.|$|E
5|$|While {{scouting}} {{for shooting}} locations in October 2006, location manager Robin Higgs visited Liverpool, concentrating mainly along the city's waterfront. Other candidates included Yorkshire, Glasgow, {{and parts of}} London. In August 2006, one of the film's producers, Charles Roven, stated that its principal photography would begin in March 2007, but filming was pushed back to April. For its release in IMAX theaters, Nolan shot four major sequences in that format, including the Joker's opening bank robbery <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> chase midway through the film, which {{marked the first time}} that a feature film had been even partially shot in the format. The cameras used for non-IMAX 35mm scenes were Panavision's Panaflex Millennium XL and Platinum.|$|E
5|$|Gran Trak 10 is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari through its subsidiary Cyan Engineering, and released by Atari in May 1974. In the game, a single player drives a car along a race track, viewed from above, avoiding walls of pylons {{and trying to}} pass as many checkpoints as possible before time runs out. The game is controlled with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and a gear stick, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> crashes and spins if it hits a pylon. Gran Trak 10 began development in fall of 1973; it was initially designed by Larry Emmons of Cyan, with the mechanical design handled by Eigen Systems, though after several design and production problems were uncovered during an initial small production run in March 1974 the design was overhauled by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, with wider distribution beginning in May. The game's circuits include possibly the first instance of integrated circuit-based read-only memory, rather than graphics storied in diodes, which thereafter became the standard for arcade games.|$|E
50|$|The McKeen {{was popular}} from 1915 through the 1930s {{throughout}} <b>the</b> United States, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> were featured on <b>the</b> Union Pacific <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Southern Pacific.|$|R

5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, an {{intrusive}} {{public works}} inspector (Carter Jahncke) tests {{the air quality}} at the squad room, but insists to an inquisitive Gee that everything is fine. The next day, however, Gee goes upstairs and finds a team wearing protective respirator suits removing hazardous asbestos from the wall. Gee angrily confronts Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) for not informing the detectives about the work, and demands it be stopped until precautionary medical checks can be conducted. Barnfather and Granger insist the removal work is safe, but give in when Gee threatens {{to go to the}} media. Meanwhile, Lewis (Clark Johnson) brags repeatedly to Crosetti (Jon Polito) about his new Ford FE V8 engine <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> he plans to build. Crosetti feigns disinterest, but the next day presents Lewis with a rear-view mirror as a gift.|$|E
5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, who think it is a joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E
5000|$|... "You Might Think" [...] is {{a single}} by <b>The</b> <b>Cars</b> from their fifth studio album, Heartbeat City, which came out in 1984. The track was written by Ric Ocasek, and {{produced}} by Mutt Lange <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Cars.</b> Ocasek sang lead vocals.|$|R
