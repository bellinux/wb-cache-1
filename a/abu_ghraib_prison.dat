40|$|In 1971, Philip Zimbardo {{conducted}} {{his famous}} prison experiment at Stanford University {{to examine the}} effects of situational variables on the behavior of volunteers engaged in roleplaying prisoners and guards. Thirty three years later, Zimbardo reacted to images of American military personnel engaged in sadistic acts at <b>Abu</b> <b>Ghraib</b> military <b>prison</b> in Iraq. Drawing a connection to the unexpected outcomes of his prison experiment, Zimbardo wrote The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil. For Zimbardo, Lucifer is a quality embedded within all people making them susceptible to the evil forces of social systems and institutions. People engage in evil, whether street crime, prison brutality, or genocide as a consequence of being seduced or pushed into behaviors they would not ordinarily do. For Zimbardo, people are not evil, only systems and those who run the systems are evil. This paper argues that Zimbardo is wrong in his understanding of the nature of evil. As James Q. Wilson noted, Evil people exist. An alternative interpretation of the causes of violent crime, brutal acts by military personnel, and even Zimbardo s own psychologically-damaging experiment is offered to argue that evil exists and that evil forces can make evil people do evil things...|$|R

40|$|O presente trabalho busca mapear o caminho de constru??o de uma sociologia do mal atrav?s de uma cr?tica ?s constru??es pr?vias desse objeto na filosofia, na psicologia social de Stanley Milgram e Phillip Zimbardo e nas abordagens sociol?gicas de Zygmunt Bauman e Jeffrey Alexander. Dessa forma, ser?o discutidas as quest?es relacionadas ao mal como objeto socialmente constru?do e que cont?m a capacidade generativa de classificar simbolicamente a realidade social e as a??es humanas a partir das rela??es de forma??o dos sujeitos e das coletividades. Essa releitura do mal como objeto sociol?gico ser? substancialmente informada pela teoria disposicional da a??o de Pierre Bourdieu, atrav?s dos seus conceitos de habitus e libido social. Para tanto, o trabalho de constru??o do mal como problema emp?rico ser? feito atrav?s da an?lise das fotografias produzidas por soldados americanos na pris?o militar de <b>Abu</b> <b>Ghraib</b> no Iraque no ano de 2003. The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to delineate the trajectory of a sociology of evil through {{a critique of the}} concept as it appears in philosophical works, the social psychology of Stanley Milgram and Phillip Zimbardo, and the sociological approaches of Zygmunt Bauman and Jeffrey Alexander. Thus, evil will be considered as a socially constructed object, which contains a generative capacity of symbolically classifying social reality and human actions through formative relations of subjects and communities. This rereading of evil as a sociological object is fundamentally based on the dispositional action theory of Pierre Bourdieu, especially in regards to its concepts of habitus and social libido. As such, evil as an empirical problem will be considered through an analysis of the photographs taken by American soldiers in 2003 at the <b>Abu</b> <b>Ghraib</b> military <b>prison</b> in Iraq...|$|R
