5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} stipitate hydnoid fungi are {{hampered}} by {{a dearth of}} information about their basic ecology, and so molecular genetic techniques are increasingly employed in attempts to better understand these fungi. In the case of Phellodon tomentosus, for example, there is little correlation between fruitbody appearance and below-ground mycelium, {{making it hard to}} determine the distribution and rarity of the fungus with standard surveying techniques. Phellodon melaleucus and P.niger were included in a Scottish study to develop species-specific PCR primers {{that can be used to}} detect the mycelia of stipitate hydnoids in soil. DNA testing of collections labelled as P.melaleucus and P.niger from the United Kingdom revealed additional cryptic species. PCR analysis can be used to determine the presence of a Phellodon species up to four years after the appearance of fruitbodies, allowing a more accurate determination of their possible decline <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> of extinction.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1877–78 Russo-Turkish War, Khrimian led the Armenian delegation at the Congress of Berlin. The delegation's mission was to present a memorandum to the great powers concerning the implementation of reforms in the Armenian provinces of the Ottoman Empire. The delegation's main goal was to secure substantial reforms in the Armenian provinces that would be supervised by European powers—which meant Russia in reality, as its troops where stationed in parts of Armenia. Armenians hoped that Russian pressure (<b>and</b> <b>threat</b> of intervention) would force the Ottoman government to improve conditions in the Armenian provinces. The Armenian delegation furthermore demanded some form of autonomy for the Armenian provinces, similar to the Maronite autonomy in Mount Lebanon, but did not advocate breakup of the Ottoman Empire or annexation of the Armenian provinces into Russia.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor faced {{significant}} {{opposition from}} the Samaritans, who resisted conversion to Christianity and were repeatedly in insurrection. He persecuted them with rigorous edicts, but yet could not prevent reprisals towards Christians from taking place in Samaria toward the close of his reign. The consistency of Justinian's policy meant that the Manicheans too suffered persecution, experiencing both exile <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> of capital punishment. At Constantinople, on one occasion, not a few Manicheans, after strict inquisition, were executed in the emperor's very presence: some by burning, others by drowning.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{pervasive}} use of promises <b>and</b> <b>threats</b> in social life, very {{little research has}} been devoted to examining the effectiveness of these interpersonal tactics in promoting cooperation in social dilemmas. Based on the Goal-Prescribes-Rationality principle, we hypothesized that cooperation should be most strongly enhanced when promises <b>and</b> <b>threats</b> are communicated in combination, rather than in isolation. Also, we hypothesized that the combination of promises <b>and</b> <b>threats</b> should be especially effective among individuals with prosocial rather than proself orientations. Two studies provided good evidence for the latter hypothesis, in that the combination of promises <b>and</b> <b>threats</b> was only effective in people with prosocial orientations, people who are concerned with equality and collective interest.

5|$|At {{the start}} of his reign, Jogaila was preoccupied with unrest in the Lithuanian Rus' lands. In 1377–78, Andrei of Polotsk, the eldest son of Algirdas, {{challenged}} Jogaila's authority and sought to become Grand Duke. In 1380, Andrei and another brother, Dmitry, sided with Prince Dmitri of Moscow against Jogaila's alliance with emir Mamai, de facto khan of the Golden Horde. Jogaila failed to support Mamai, lingering {{in the vicinity of the}} battlefield, which led to Mamai's army's significant defeat at the hands of Prince Dmitri in the Battle of Kulikovo. The Muscovites' Pyrrhic victory over the Golden Horde, in the long term, signified, however, the beginning of a slow climb to power by the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which became within a century the most serious rival <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> to the integrity, well-being and survival of Lithuania. However, in 1380 Muscovy was greatly weakened by tremendous losses suffered during the battle and thus, in the same year, Jogaila was free to begin a struggle for supremacy with Kęstutis.|$|E
5|$|In the 1998 storyline {{where he}} fakes dissociative {{identity}} disorder (split personalities) to avoid a prison sentence for hostage <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> charges, he is given four personalities that represent his core being: A childlike personality named Tom, Italian playboy Rod, parental figure Miss Perkins, and the abusive Pete (the personality responsible for his worst misdeeds). The revelation that he is faking the personalities devastates Viki, who had actually suffered from the disorder; it also brings out remorse in Todd, and causes him to reflect on his mistakes. The storyline ends with the implication that the personalities {{may not have been}} as fabricated as Todd believed them to be. The writers also made it so that his difficulties are manifested in his nightmares, which give him insomnia and are designed as a look into his psyche; at multiple points within the series, Téa attempts to help Todd by encouraging him to open up to her about them, which he eventually does. His opinions on his enemies are conveyed clearly; he remains one step ahead of them, and consistently out-smarts police, family, and others he targets, sometimes using weapons.|$|E

30|$|Among several {{existing}} approaches, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, <b>and</b> <b>threats</b> (SWOT) analysis, evaluating each of {{the indicated}} terms in an organization, is the most acclaimed (Hill and Westbrook 1997). SWOT analysis {{is the most significant}} part of strategic formulation. By identifying the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, <b>and</b> <b>threats,</b> the organization can build strategies upon its strengths, eliminate its weaknesses, and exploit its opportunities or utilize them to encounter the <b>threats.</b> The strengths <b>and</b> weaknesses are considered as an internal organization environment appraisal, while the opportunities <b>and</b> <b>threats</b> are considered as an external organization environment appraisal (Dyson 2004).|$|R
5|$|Social {{hierarchy}} {{in western}} jackdaw flocks {{is determined by}} supplanting, fighting, <b>and</b> <b>threat</b> displays—several {{of which have been}} described. In the bill-up posture, the western jackdaw tilts its bill and head upwards and sleeks its plumage. Indicating both appeasement and assertiveness, the posture is used by birds intending to enter feeding flocks. A bill-down posture is another commonly used agonistic behaviour. In this display, a bird lowers its bill and erects its nape and head feathers, and sometimes slightly lifts its wings. Western jackdaws often face off in this posture until one backs down or a fight ensues. In the forward-threat posture, a bird holds its body horizontally and thrusts its head forwards. In intense versions, the bird ruffles its feathers and spreads or raises its tail and wings. This extreme is seen when facing off over nests or females. In the defensive-threat posture, the bird lowers its head and bill, spreads its tail and ruffles its feathers. Supplanting is where one bird moves in and displaces another from a perch-site. The second bird usually retreats without resorting to a fight. Western jackdaws fight by launching themselves at each other feet-first and then wrestling with their feet intertwined and pecking at each other. Other individuals gather and call noisily.|$|E
