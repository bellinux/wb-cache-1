50|$|<b>As</b> <b>civil</b> <b>{{engineers}},</b> OSP {{engineers are}} responsible for drafting plans, either by hand or using Computer-aided design (CAD) software, for how telecom plant facilities will be placed. Often when working with municipalities trenching or boring permits are required and drawings must be made for these. Often these drawings include about 70% {{or so of the}} detailed information required to pave a road or add a turn lane to an existing street. Structural calculations are required when boring under heavy traffic areas such as highways or when attaching to other structures such as bridges. <b>As</b> <b>civil</b> <b>engineers,</b> telecom engineers provide the modern communications backbone for all technological communications distributed throughout civilizations today.|$|R

From the candidates Andrée picked the 27-year-old engineer, Knut Frænkel, to replace Ekholm. Frænkel was <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>engineer</b> from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and scientific knowledge, he handled this task efficiently.

While assigned to Fort Sullivan in Eastport, Maine in 1833, tragedy struck Greene's family: Elizabeth and all three of their children died within seven months, probably from tuberculosis. To ease the pain on his mind and to escape the isolation and loneliness of peacetime Army garrison duty, he immersed himself in study of both the law and medicine, coming close to professional certification in both by the time he resigned his commission in 1836 to become <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>engineer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji {{was born}} Leon Dudley Sorabji in Chingford, Essex (now Greater London), on 14 August 1892.

Shapurji Sorabji had married in India in 1880 but, as no record of his first wife's death or his divorce from her has yet been traced, it is possible that he married the composer's mother bigamously.|$|E
