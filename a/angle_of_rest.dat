Her only ballast consisted of some six hundred conical shot, or twelve tons for a ship of eight hundred. After one hour of steaming (= seven miles) we passed the green mouth of the Wady Antar, in whose Istabl ("stable"), or upper valley-course, the pilgrimage-caravan camps. It drains a small inland feature to the north-east, the true [...] "Jebel Antar," [...] which the Hydrographic Chart has confounded with the great block, applying, moreover, the term Istabl to the height instead of the hollow. This Jebel Libn, along which we are now steaming, is a counterpart on a small scale, a little brother, of the Shárr, measuring 3733 instead of 6000 to 6500 feet. We first see from the north a solid block capped with a mural crown of three peaks. When abreast of us the range becomes a tall, fissured, and perpendicular wall: this apical comb, bluff to the west, reposes upon a base sloping, at the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest,</b> to the environing sandy Wady. To complete the resemblance, even the queer [...] "Pins" [...] are not wanting; and I should expect to find in it all the accidents of the giant of El-Muwaylah.|$|E

It was raining when the construction train rolled noisily through a mountain gorge, {{and he stood}} {{at the door of the}} caboose, looking out. Three or four hundred feet below, a green river, streaked with muddy foam, brawled among the rocks, for the track had been dug out of a steep hillside. Festing knew this was difficult work; one could deal with rock, although it cost much to cut, but it was another matter to bed the rails in treacherous gravel, and the fan-shaped mounds of shale and soil that ran down to the water's edge showed how loose the ground was and the abruptness of the slope. Above, the silver mist drifted about the black firs that clung to the side of the mountain, and in the distance there was a gleam of snow. Some of the trees had fallen, and it was significant that, for the most part, they did not lie where they fell. They had slipped down hill, and the channels in the ground indicated that the shock had been enough to start a miniature avalanche which had carried them away. The pitch was near the slant engineers call the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest,</b> but Festing thought there was rock not far beneath, which prevented the solidification of the superincumbent soil. It looked as if his contract would be difficult and he would earn his pay.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the strains due to folding of bedded rocks can lead to the {{geometrical}} modification of sedimentary structures. Cross-bedding is a sedimentary structure that consists of a set of surfaces inclined to the main surface of sedimentation. These oblique surfaces or foresets have angles of inclination governed by the critical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> of the sand when it was deposited. Foresets are usually bounded on their upper side by a truncation surface produced by erosion. In deformed rocks the inclination angles of foresets can be modified by the effect of strains associated with folding. Modelling of the effects of fold strains on these angles around individual folds suggests that pattern of variation of the angles of obliquity of foresets may permit the identification of the folding mechanism (Ramsay, 1967, p. 491 – 517, Bobillo-Ares et al., in press). These models assume that the foresets deform as mechanically passive planar markers. The folded cross-bedding in the photograph is seen in a loose boulder at the harbour at Burela, Galicia, Spain though the identical structure is also seen in situ in the cliffs. The photo shows foreset angles that vary across the fold with the largest angles seen on the left limb. In fact, locally on this limb the foresets are themselves folded, producing angles with the main bedding that exceed 90 ° (i. e. overturned foresets) in this two dimensional section. Although overturning of this kind observed in other regions have been attributed to deformation of a liquefied sand by current drag (Allen and Banks, 1972), water escape during fluidization (Owen, 1995) or synsedimentary slumping, the evidence here points to tectonic folding of the foresets. This evidence consists of the stepped geometry of the erosion surface above the overturned foresets. The sense of the steps is consistent with the flexural slip folds within the coset on the left limb of the main fold. The operation of this mechanism points to a non-passive mechanical behaviour of the foresets during folding. It appears that slip is concentrated at the top of individual foresets where the sandstone is darker and more micaceous. The folding instability of these cross-beds may in part be due to the initial concave-upwards curvature of these cross-beds.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} visual anti-predator strategies {{employed by}} the Lepidoptera. I examine key aspects of pattern and behaviour and how {{they relate to the}} reduction of an individual’s predation risk. Symmetrical patterns {{have been found to be}} easier to remember and pick out, suggesting that symmetry is beneficial to aposematic displays. This suggests that symmetry may be maladaptive in cryptic patterning and asymmetry beneficial. In Chapter one, I report the results of a field experiment using artificial prey and wild birds to investigate how asymmetry and symmetry affect the efficiency of cryptic patterning to reduce predation. I found that asymmetry does not affect predation rate, in agreement with previous work. Yet, there is still the problem of how to mesh this with the potentially conflicting conclusions of symmetry studies. Chapter two examines aspects of the intimidation hypotheses of Lepidopteran eyespots. These address the generally larger and more centrally placed spots found on Lepidopteran wings and state that they startle or intimidate predators, providing time for escape. While it is agreed that eyespots intimidate or startle predators, the mechanism has not been agreed. There are two competing lines of thought 1) that ‘eyespots’ intimidate because they resemble the eyes of the predators’ own predators and 2) that it is the conspicuous colouration of the pattern that induces the startle or avoidance behaviour. The first experiment utilised artificial prey with differing ‘directions of gaze’ in a field setting. If purely conspicuous patterns direction of gaze should have no influence on prey survival. The results indicate that patterns imitating staring or upward gazes provide the greatest protection, suggesting that in some cases eyespots may be being perceived as eyes and not simply as conspicuous patterns. I wanted to see if it would be possible to find a way in which to measure or quantify the reaction of an animal to ‘real’ eyes, in order to compare it to the reaction to eyespots. Recent trials investigating human reactions to eye contact suggested a computer based method may be possible. In this second experiment we examined whether the direct gaze of a predator might produce a measurable effect in human subjects. I was not able find any effect, but it is unclear as to whether this is due to problems with the experimental set up. In Chapter three I investigate a factor often over looked in the study of crypsis, that of the behavioural adaptations that can enhance its efficiency. The larvae of the early thorn moth (Selenia dentaria) masquerade as twigs, using both colouration and behaviour adaptations. I compared the angle at which the larvae rested, to the angle at which real twigs deviate from the main stem. The results found that the larvae showed variation in their <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> and do not appear to match the angle of real twigs on the host tree. This result suggests that perfectly matching the angles of real twigs is not necessary to twig mimicry. While carrying out this experiment it was noticed that a breeze appeared to increase larval activity and induced a ‘swaying’ behaviour. This led me to examine whether mimic species may utilise the visual ‘noise’ produced by windy conditions to camouflage movement. Firstly, a small ‘proof of concept’ pilot was carried out, followed by a larger study using 2 different twig mimic species. The study involved measuring movement and swaying behaviour in 3 conditions (still air, wind setting 1 and 2). The results suggest that cryptic and mimetic lepidopteran species may use windy conditions to camouflage their movements and that some species may employ specialised ‘swaying’ behaviours. Cryptic species are limited in opportunities to move between foraging sites without increasing detection by predators, therefore, any adaptation that might reduce detection is extremely advantageous. In Chapter four I examine how conspicuousness and colouration are affected by living in a group, particularly in relation to other group members. A field experiment using groups of artificial prey, with differing densities and group sizes was used to explore the effect of group size and density on the predation risk and detectibility of cryptic prey. My results show that, as expected, larger groups are more likely to be detected, but that the increase is much slower than a linear increase. This suggests that groups must increase considerably in size before any individual group member will suffer increased predation risk. The second experiment examines the ‘oddity effect’ and how it affects predation. This hypothesises that when confronted by grouped prey, predators can increase their kill rate by concentrating their efforts on capturing unusual or ‘odd’ prey, a strategy that reduces the ‘confusion effect’. A field experiment was conducted with groups composed of differing proportions of two artificial cryptic prey types. Groups with odd individuals did not suffer an increase in conspicuousness and were not attacked more often. However, once located and attacked the groups did suffer a greater predation rate. Odd individuals were predated at a greater rate than normal individuals and the rate did not change as more or less odd individuals were added to the group. A computer based ‘game’ was used to further investigate the oddity effect. The results from the initial run of the game appeared to show strong evidence for the oddity effect, with a further significant increase in this effect when attention is split between foraging for prey and scanning for predators. To be confident of this result the experiment was repeated with the ‘odd’ and ‘normal’ seed patterns reversed. The new data set strongly suggested that much of the effect seen in the previous experiment was due to a difference in pattern visibility between the two seed patterns. Nevertheless, the results indicated that selecting odd seeds is quicker than selecting normal seeds. The results from both the field and computer trials suggest that preference for odd prey may improve predator foraging speed and efficiency. Chapter five investigates whether cryptic and non-defended prey could reduce their predation risk by grouping with aposematic and defended prey. This was tested using artificial prey in a field setting. My results show that undefended non-aposematic prey can benefit by grouping with aposematic prey with no evidence that predation rates for aposematic prey were adversely affected by this association. If confirmed this might illuminate the origins of Batesian mimicry. I have investigated a range of anti-predator adaptations and strategies in the Lepidoptera and in particular pattern elements and use of crypsis and aposematic displays. These anti-predator strategies are important in that they modify predation rate and so directly influence the evolution of species. While I have been able to provide evidence for some current hypotheses, in many respects my results demonstrate that there is still a lot to learn about visual anti-predatory strategies.

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} effects of posture on subacromial (SA) space with arm {{elevation}} in patients with rotator cuff disease (RCD) and healthy subjects. Background: Poor posture has been linked to altered scapular mechanics, theorized to lead to excessive SA space narrowing. However, no study has examined the direct effects of posture on SA space using ultrasonography. We hypothesize that when compared to a neutral posture, upright posture will increase SA space and slouched posture will decrease SA space. Methods: Subjects with painful RCD (n= 31) and healthy (n= 29) shoulders participated. SA space was measured on ultrasound generated images using the acromiohumeral distance (AHD), which is the shortest distance between acromion and the humerus. Two trials each were collected in three postures of normal, slouched and upright posture with the arm at two <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> (0 ° elevation) and 45 ° abduction. Results: Two RMANOVAs for each arm angle compared the AHD across postures and groups. There was no interaction between group and posture, and no significant main effect of group for AHD. Groups were collapsed for further analysis. There was a significant main effect of posture on AHD at the 45 ° abduction (p = 0. 0002); AHD increased significantly from normal (AHD= 8. 63 mm) to upright (AHD= 9. 76 mm) posture. Conclusion: The effect of posture on SA space is minimal; only upright posture increasing AHD over normal posture by 1. 13 mm, at 45 ° abduction position.

50|$|A simple {{model of}} {{this effect is}} a solid slab of {{material}} which is heavier than water (like a steel plate) but is shaped and oriented {{to have a positive}} <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack. At <b>rest,</b> the slab will sink because it is heavier than water; the buoyant forces are overwhelmed by the force of gravity. However, if the slab is kept in the same orientation and pulled horizontally through the water, it will force the incoming water downward. This results in a reactionary force upward on the slab. At a high enough speed, this reactionary force (plus any small buoyant force) is larger than the force of gravity and the slab will stay afloat. In this way, the horizontal force (which may be supplied by a motor or a sail) is converted into a vertical force upwards. The concept of planing is often interpreted as analogous with aerodynamic lift (See lift on an airfoil), but in reality the acting forces are very different.|$|R
