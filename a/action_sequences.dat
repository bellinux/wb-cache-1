5|$|With its {{unprecedented}} budget, IRIS {{was able}} to pioneer several firsts for Korean television dramas, particularly with its large scale <b>action</b> <b>sequences.</b> Throughout filming, the actors were often responsible for filming their own stunts and <b>action</b> <b>sequences,</b> including Lee Byung-hun jumping from the 130 meter-tall Tamagawa Dam in Semboku, Akita. To prepare for the demanding physical requirements of the series, {{several members of the}} primary cast, including Kim Tae-hee, underwent special training to lend authenticity to the action. During a break in filming, Lee Byung-hun appeared at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival in support of the production in May. A press conference was also held later in the month with the entire finalized cast of the series.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{times of}} fast {{changing}} markets and short product life-cycles manufacturing systems {{have to be}} adaptable and able to support a variety in products and product volumes. Production has to be product-driven and switching between different products should be possible with little manual intervention. We suggest an <b>action</b> <b>sequence</b> generation approach that tailors the control programs of resources to product needs. The approach requires {{a model of the}} available resources with their capabilities and internal material flow, the material flow between resources as well as a product description. An <b>action</b> <b>sequence</b> can then be generated out of these models and later translated into an executable <b>action</b> <b>sequence.</b> The <b>action</b> <b>sequence</b> can be automatically downloaded and executed on a resource. The approach is evaluated on an educational production system with industrial components...|$|R

5|$|Daredevil was {{released}} on February 14, 2003. It received generally mixed reviews from critics with many praising the <b>action</b> <b>sequences,</b> acting performances, its soundtrack, storyline and its visual style and stunts, while many negatively criticized its dramatic depth and commented that the film resembles a Greek tragedy. Despite its critical reaction, the movie became the second-biggest February release to that time and grossed over $179 million against production budget of $78 million.|$|E
5|$|From Thunderball {{through to}} Die Another Day, the gun barrel {{sequence}} segues into the pre-title sequence {{by having the}} opening shot be sighted through the barrel. Beginning with The Spy Who Loved Me, the teasers emphasised not only <b>action</b> <b>sequences</b> but stunts, a practice that prevailed until Casino Royale. The sequence for The World Is Not Enough is unusually long: at over fourteen minutes it is {{two to three times}} the length of most others.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, in the {{television}} film SpongeBob's Truth or Square, various celebrities guest appeared, including Rosario Dawson, Craig Ferguson, Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, LeBron James, Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog, and Robin Williams as guest actors appearing as themselves in the live <b>action</b> <b>sequences,</b> while Ricky Gervais provided vocal cameo as the narrator.|$|E

5|$|On Stranger Tides broke many {{box office}} records upon release, and it {{stands as the}} 23rd-highest-grossing film of all time {{worldwide}} when not adjusting for inflation. Critical reviews were mixed, with the film receiving criticism over its writing, directing, excessiveness and lack of originality; positive mentions were given on the acting, <b>action</b> <b>sequences,</b> music, visuals and the running time for being much shorter than the previous two films. A sequel, titled , was released in 2017.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opened to}} theaters on September 10, 2004. On {{a budget of}} $40 million, the film grossed $51 million {{domestically}} and $129 million worldwide, surpassing the box office gross of the previous installment. Resident Evil: Apocalypse received mostly negative reviews from critics, who praised the <b>action</b> <b>sequences</b> but criticized the plot. The film was released to DVD on December 28, 2004.|$|E
5|$|The film's story {{takes place}} in Death Valley, where the large scale <b>action</b> <b>sequences</b> take place amid post-apocalyptic landscapes of Las Vegas in broad daylight. Drawing inspirations from western films and post-apocalyptic movies, {{including}} the Mad Max series, Extinction manages to reference such predecessors, with plot elements revolving around the shortage of oil, the shortage of supplies, a convoy traveling across a desert, and the desert taking over civilized land.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} {{initially}} stalled {{due to the}} 9/11 terrorist attacks, and when production eventually began, the film's title was changed several times. A variety of visual effects were used for <b>action</b> <b>sequences,</b> even though Wiseman and Willis stated {{that they wanted to}} limit the amount of CGI in the film. In separate incidents during filming, both Willis and his stunt double were injured.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing as}} Jodie, the game {{includes}} interactive objects {{marked with a}} white dot, which can be interacted with by tilting the controller stick in its direction. If Jodie must perform a specific action, icons pop {{up on the screen}} to prompt the player to press and/or hold certain controller buttons. Conversation prompts float in the air, defaulting to a certain choice if too much time passes before selection. During <b>action</b> <b>sequences,</b> like chases or hand-to-hand combat, the cinematography moves into slow motion whilst Jodie performs the physical manoeuvre; during this time, the player must determine the direction Jodie is moving and push the controller stick in that direction to complete the action. Other sequences require real-time stealth, which has the player sneak Jodie through environments while coordinating certain actions with Aiden. Failing certain <b>action</b> <b>sequences</b> will alter the course of a chapter (and sometimes later chapters) and in some cases lead to the death of a non-playable character.|$|E
5|$|Angel Beats! {{received}} generally positive reviews by critics. The {{integration of}} various individual elements together, such as musical performances, humor and action, was commended in one review but panned in another, {{saying that the}} story was overloaded with too many elements. P.A.Works was praised for the animation of the <b>action</b> <b>sequences</b> and attention to detail with the weapons used. A major flaw noted by critics, however, is that the anime is too short, which leaves many of the characters with untold back-stories. The anime was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the 14th Japan Media Arts Festival in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Before its September 2011 release, Drive {{was shown}} {{at a number}} of film festivals, {{including}} the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where it was praised and received a standing ovation. Refn won the festival's Best Director Award. The film received widespread praise, with critics highlighting Refn's direction, performances by the ensemble cast, visuals and <b>action</b> <b>sequences,</b> and the film score composed by Cliff Martinez. However, some critics were appalled by its graphic violence and found it potentially detrimental to the film's box office success. Several critics listed Drive {{as one of the best}} films of 2011; it received various accolades, including Best Sound Editing nomination at the 84th Academy Awards.|$|E

In 2014 Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors, and stunt actors to list their top action films; Thunderball was listed at number 73.|$|E

Ben Burttwho was also the film's sound editorwas {{responsible}} for <b>action</b> <b>sequences</b> under Lucas' supervision.

5|$|First {{published}} in 2004 by Victor Gollancz Ltd, {{the book is}} Morgan's third novel, the first two {{being part of the}} Takeshi Kovacs series. Market Forces satirises corporate practices and globalisation and carries the theme of competition throughout the story. Violence is used {{as a metaphor for the}} mechanisms underlying capitalism and assumptions about haves and have-nots are challenged. It won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2005 and was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award. Though book reviewers gave it a mixed reception, Morgan's descriptive writing and <b>action</b> <b>sequences</b> received praise.|$|E
