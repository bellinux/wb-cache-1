5|$|The Welsh coal {{industry}} employed 1,500 workers in 1800; {{and as the}} industry expanded, the workforce rose to 30,000 by 1864, and to 250,000 by 1913. As employment became available, many people moved {{to the area of}} the South Wales Coalfield; between 1851 and 1911 the population increased by 320,000. By 1913 the Welsh collieries were extracting 56.8million long tons of coal (63.6million short tons) a year, up from 8.5million long tons (9.5million short tons) in 1854; collieries in the region mined <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> all coal produced in the UK, and employed <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> its miners in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1913 Britain was responsible for 25 per cent of world coal production and 55 percent of all world coal exports.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from his}} role as a {{national}} spokesman for provincial rights, Macdonald presided over an administration that invested heavily in education. His government financed the building of rural high schools and extended financial assistance to Dalhousie University's schools of medicine and law. Macdonald also appointed Nova Scotia's first minister of education, Henry Hicks, in 1949 to oversee $7.6million in spending, about <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> the provincial budget.|$|E
5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution. However, because {{of the differences in}} motion between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On dry land, a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only slightly more than <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non-Laticauda sea snakes are virtually stranded on dry land.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the issue}} of the papal bull Clericis laicos in 1296, forbidding the payment of taxes to a secular power, Winchelsey urged his clergy in 1297 to refuse {{payments}} to Edward. However, the clergy of the province of York paid a tax of <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> their revenues. Edward then declared clerics who refused to pay outlaws, and ordered their property to be seized. He conceded that the clergy could return to his protection if they paid a fine of <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> their revenues, exactly what the northern clergy had offered in the way of taxation. The royal clerks and many other clergy paid the fines, and in March, the southern clergy met again, and after a long debate, Winchelsey instructed each clerk to decide for himself whether or not to pay the fine. It appears that most chose to pay, but the archbishop still refused to make any contribution, and so Edward seized his lands. They were returned to him in July 1297, when the king and prelate were reconciled at Westminster. Winchelsey then tried to mediate between Edward and the earls, who also objected to Edward's tax demands.|$|E

By August 2009 wind power capacity was a fraction short of 1.5 GW and total renewables capacity had reached over 3.1 GW. By mid-2011 these figures were 2.76 GW and 4.6 GW respectively.|$|E

5|$|Adult dragonflies hunt on {{the wing}} using their {{exceptionally}} acute eyesight and strong, agile flight. They are almost exclusively carnivorous, eating {{a wide variety of}} insects ranging from small midges and mosquitoes to butterflies, moths, damselflies, and smaller dragonflies. A large prey item is subdued by being bitten on the head and is carried by the legs to a perch. Here, the wings are discarded and the prey usually ingested head first. A dragonfly may consume as much as <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> its body weight in prey per day.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Second World War, {{construction}} {{began on}} the second phase, the B Station. The station came into operation gradually between 1953 and 1955. It was nearly identical to the A Station from the outside and was constructed directly to its east as a mirror to it, which gave the power station its now familiar four-chimney layout. The construction of the B Station brought the site's generating capacity up to 509 megawatts (MW), making it the third largest generating site in the UK at the time, providing <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> London's electricity needs (with the remainder supplied by 28 smaller stations). It was also the most thermally efficient power station in the world when it opened.|$|E

In January 2015, five UCI Professional Continental teams were given wildcard places into the race by the race organisers– Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) – to complete the 22-team peloton. Among the wildcard teams was , the first African trade team {{to participate in the}} Tour. As each team was entitled to enter nine riders, the peloton on the first stage consisted of 198 riders. These came from 32 countries. 41 riders – approximately <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> the peloton – were French; no other nation had more than 20 riders in the race. Merhawi Kudus and Daniel Teklehaimanot were the first ever Eritrean riders to participate in the Tour.|$|E
5|$|Food {{waste is}} {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food waste is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E
5|$|Fort Snelling was {{established}} in 1819 to extend United States jurisdiction over the area and to allay concerns about British fur traders in the area. The soldiers initially camped at a site {{on the south side}} of the Minnesota River, but conditions were hard there and nearly <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> the soldiers died of scurvy in the winter of 1819–1820. They later moved their camp to Camp Coldwater in May 1820. Much of the military's activity was conducted there while the fort was built. Camp Coldwater, the site of a cold, clear, flowing spring, was also considered sacred by the native Dakota.|$|E
