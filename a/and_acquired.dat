5|$|A frontal trough moved eastward off {{the southeastern}} United States on September30, {{becoming}} stationary north of Haiti. The trough developed {{an area of}} disturbed weather that interacted with an upper-level low pressure area, resulting {{in the development of}} a subtropical depression on October7.
