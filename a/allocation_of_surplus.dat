When the asymmetry of the network effects is large, then the side with the low network effect participates for free. We depart from existing networks literature by endogenizing the network effects and focusing on the network design resulting from investments in network effects.

This outcome is supported as a perfect sequential equilibrium of the informed principal game when the joint probability distribution from which the agents' types are drawn satisfies two conditions: the well-known condition of Cremer and McLean and Identifiability condition introduced by Kosenok and Severinov [Individually rational, budget-balanced mechanisms and <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>surplus,</b> J.

A pricing approach is presented to deal with underwriting and investment risk, guided by basic risk/return principles, which addresses the policyholder and shareholder perspectives in a consistent manner. A methodology to determine leverage is also presented, but as a distinct and separate element, enabling the pricing approach to be applied either with or without <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> to lines of business. Since the leverage is also developed within a total risk/return framework, the approach provides a means to integrate what are often disjointed rate and solvency regulatory activities. Risk is controlled by {{a focus on the}} likelihood that total return falls short of the target “fair ” return by an amount which results in a specified drawdown of surplus. Thus rate adequacy and solvency are dealt with simultaneously. A shift away from probability of ruin and expected policyholder deficit approaches to solvency and ratings is proposed and explained. An “Operating Rate of Return ” is defined and suggested as the appropriate rate of return measure that should be used for measuring the charge for risk transfer from the policyholder to the company, rather than other measures such as profit margin, return on premium, etc...|$|E

Until January 1977, the fishing grounds off the Canadian coasts were there to be exploited by any nation with the means to do so. Interstate competition had a disastrous effect on the stock. With the extension of Canadian responsibilities to 200 miles offshore, a national System was laid down for stock exploitation and appropriation. From 1976 to 1982, Canada set up plans for the strict management of its fisheries, and numerous agreements were signed which allowed for the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> stock from the Canadian waters in return for a market for Canadian sea products. From 1982 to 1985, with its stock increasing, Canada's policy appeared more generous since it allowed for the allocation of its non-surplus stock to signatory countries with a growing market for Canadian goods or with lower tarriff barriers. Since 1985, the emphasis in Canada has been mainly on conservation : Non-surplus stocks are allocated to countries who buy Canadian sea products, though especially those who respect the Canadian territorial limits and who respect the quotas, set by the North West Atlantic Fishing Organisation, outside Canada's 200 -mile zone in the Atlantic.

40|$|In {{the first}} two chapters, a non-negative {{function}} defined on the class of subsets of a finite set of players (or factors) describes the technology for producing a single good. Given this aggregate data, the problem of <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> among individual players (or factors) is studied in two different models.;In Chapter 1, an axiomatic approach is adopted to construct an allocation rule that is immune to positive monotone transformations of the players 2 ̆ 7 utilities. Under this rule, each player is paid a weighted average of his (or her) marginal contributions to various coalitions. In fact, these weights coincide with the Shapley weights. The model also provides a proper framework for interpreting the Shapley value as the ex-ante evaluation of a conflict situation.;Chapter 2 studies an evolutionary bargaining model in which myopic players with limited memory make simultaneous demands, naively based on precedent. Necessary and sufficient conditions are provided under which the long-run equilibria coincide with the core allocations. Refining the set of equilibria by allowing {{for the possibility of}} mistakes, it is shown that the unique limiting equilibrium allocation maximizes the product of players 2 ̆ 7 utilities subject to being in the core of the technology.;Chapter 3 studies the effect of different communication possibilities on the coalitional stability of bargained outcomes.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the mobilization of}} domestic resources in the Philippines and Thailand, with special emphasis on the financial sector. The analysis consists of three parts. In the first part, {{the development of the}} level of savings in both countries is evaluated and alternative savings theories are examined. For households, the most important savings sector, the official national income accounts estimate is compared with a flow-of-funds estimate based on data compiled from a multitude of sources. The estimation of alternative savings functions reveals that income and income distribution are the main determinants of the level of savings, while interest rates, inflation, foreign capital inflow and financial intermediation have only a small impact overall. In {{the second part of the}} study, the performance of the Philippine and Thai financial systems with respect to savings mobilization is evaluated. The six main financial instruments, that is, deposits, deposit substitutes, long-term debt securities, corporate shares, life insurance and employee benefit funds are analyzed with respect to accessibility, liquidity, yield, risk, product variation and information. It is argued that weaknesses in the financial systems and lack of attractive financial instruments are mainly due to ill-conceived government regulations and insufficient initiative on the part of the private financial institutions. In the third part of the analysis, the structure of personal savings and the factors that influence it are studied. In order to explain the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> funds among various financial instruments, the portfolio selection approach is applied. This is the first such attempt for developing economies.

Although bioenergy is classified as a renewable energy source, land is a finite resource and its expansion limited. The anthropogenic demands on land result from a combination of multiple provisioning services. These include global food consumption, dietary preference, crop and livestock yields, land use integration, wastes and residues, and bioenergy yields and forms, as well as the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> land for forestry and energy crops, and the potential role of negative emission technologies. Thus, bioenergy is just one part of a complex land-use system. The general hypothesis is that there are fundamental limits to the overall scale and rate of the sustainable expansion of bioenergy, which can be assessed by means of combinations of empirical data, mapping tools and complex systems models. To this end, a novel methodological approach is proposed, which is based on a combination of two original models. The first one is termed the Global Calculator Land Use Change Model (GCLUC), developed as part of the Global Calculator Project, in which land is freely allocated worldwide and food security is assumed a priority. The second considers land for dedicated energy crops as a delimited reserve, by integrating Hubbert’s curve principles (originally proposed for peak oil assessments) in agro-ecological zoning schemes (as recently done for sugarcane ethanol in Brazil), resulting in a new model here termed green-Hubbert. The results show ranges of bioenergy potentials and expansion rates in the context of different land use futures. The potential public policies necessary to support sustainable bioenergy are also discussed. Finally, the conclusions show that, indeed, there are fundamental limits to bioenergy, and these limits are dynamic over time. Open Acces...|$|E

Standard theory of natural monopoly is extended here to explain why long-run marginal cost (LMC) can be greater than both average cost and short-run marginal cost (SMC) for municipal water utilities. The distinctions between "benign monopoly rates" and "marginal cost rate design" favor LMC over SMC {{as the basis for}} economically efficient rate design.

40|$|Background and Discussion: Few {{topics are}} as widely {{discussed}} as goodwill and IFRS 3, and several debates address {{the difficulties of}} valuation, accounting, allocation, and impairment tests of goodwill. The original intentions of IFRS is that the users of the financial statements must be given enough information about the companies’ earnings {{in order to make}} an appropriate assessment of the relevance of the goodwill. The financial analysts play an important role on the financial market, since they are frequently viewed as information intermediaries who gather, process, and distribute information for investors. Therefore, their perception of financial statements is of great importance. This study aims to further investigate the implementation of IFRS 3 by the following research question: ‐ Is the accounting for goodwill consistent with the purpose of The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting? Aim of study: The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate and clarify the financial analysts’ view of the implementation of IFRS 3 and the issues concerning <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> values in corporate acquisitions and the implementation of impairment tests. Methodology: The study was carried out through interviews with three financial analysts working with major investments as the basis for our empirical data. The interviews were conducted both personally and via telephone, transcribed, and later on analyzed. The study adopts a qualitative character where the results give an indication of similarities and differences between theory and reality. Results and conclusions: The fact that the accounted value for goodwill is neither perceived as reliable, nor comparable, indicates that the purpose of the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting is not met. The results show that the financial analysts devote time and energy trying rather to understand the underlying factors that contribute to the company’s earnings than assessing the accounted values for goodwill in the financial reports. However, even though there is a noted problem with today’s accounting for goodwill, this has limited impact on the financial analysts we have met. We have found no indicators of the deficiencies regarding accounting for goodwill being so severe that they result in inaccurate evaluations by the financial analysts...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{experimentally}} how the endogenous group formation {{combined with}} the possibility of repeated interaction impacts cooperation levels and surplus distribution. We developed a Surplus Production Distribution Game where the cooperation of four agents is needed to produce a <b>surplus.</b> In case <b>of</b> cooperation, two of the four subjects, the distributors, decided how much <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> each <b>of</b> them wanted to give to the two other agents, the receivers. This game was played repeatedly with different matching procedures. In the Re-match Treatment (RT) the subjects got randomly re-matched every round, while in the Endogenous-match Treatment (ET) a group was maintained as long as its members cooperated. There was also a Base treatment (BT) where cooperation was exogenously enforced. We found that the distributor's contributions were higher in the ET and the RT than in the BT - unsurprisingly, receivers' possibility to refuse cooperation led to more equal surplus distributions. But contrary to commonly hold beliefs, the possibility of repeated interaction did not lead to higher cooperation levels and more equal <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>surplus.</b> Instead, endogenous group formation {{combined with the}} possibility of repeated interaction led to self-selection of the subjects in the ET. The endogenous group duration varied drastically between different groups in the ET, with long-lived groups exhibiting contributions and cooperation levels higher than in the RT, while short-lived groups showed contributions and cooperation levels lower than in the RT. Furthermore, for given contribution levels, receivers were more likely to refuse cooperation when their average relationship length was short. This shows that long-lived groups consisted of generous distributors and not so demanding receivers, while ungenerous distributors and demanding receivers formed short-lived groups. Hence, the possibility of repeated interaction does not necessarily increase cooperation and efficiency levels when combined with endogenous group formation. Rather, such a situation might lead to self-selection of agents. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} analyzes {{a proposed}} action that would allocate the ABC surplus (i. e., {{the difference between}} acceptable biological catch and total allowable catch) for flathead sole, rock sole, and yellowfin sole, among the Amendment 80 cooperatives and CDQ groups, using the same formulas {{that are used in}} the annual harvest specifications process. These entities would be able to exchange their flathead sole, rock sole, and/or yellowfin sole quota share for an equivalent amount <b>of</b> their <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> the ABC <b>surplus</b> for these species. The approach is intended to increase the opportunity for maximizing the harvest of these species, while ensuring that the overall 2 million mt optimum yield, and ABCs for each individual species, are not exceeded. The analysis also includes options to restrict flexibility in the exchange of yellowfin sole, if the analysis shows that there is a potential negative impact of the approach on users of yellowfin sole in the Bering Sea Aleutian Islands trawl limited access sector. The proposed action would amend the Fishery Management Plan fo...|$|R
40|$|The raison d tre of wage-indexed {{defined benefit}} pension funds {{is to provide}} {{insurance}} against standard-of-living risk after retirement, based on intergenerational risk sharing. Pension funds necessarily have to accept mismatch risk in providing this kind of insurance. Mismatch risk taken by the pension fund is risk for the fund s stakeholders. We combine the value-based approach and the method of generational accounting to analyze the economic value of the stakes of the different generations {{and the issue of}} who gains and who loses (transfers of value between generations) from alternative funding and indexation policies. Rules concerning the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> a funding <b>surplus</b> or funding shortage in particular are decisive to the direction and to the size of transfers of value between stakeholders. We put forward two criteria to evaluate alternative policies employed by pension funds: the funding policy and allocation rules must give an ex ante fair compensation for risk taken by generations and the sustainability of a pension plan must be checked with respect to ex post redistributive effects for current and future generations. Value-based generational accounting provides a tool for testing a pension fund policy for these two criteria. ...|$|R
5000|$|Hunger as an {{academic}} and social topic came to prominence during the Great Depression. As many individuals struggled for food, the same agricultural industries were suddenly producing large <b>surpluses</b> as means <b>of</b> increased production to counter the drop in demand from the European markets. This increased output was meant to ease the growing debt levels, however domestic demand could {{not keep up with}} prices. Instead, what is often called [...] "the paradox of want amid plenty," [...] agricultural surpluses and large demand simply did not fit together, causing the Hoover administration to buy large amounts of product, such as grain, to stabilize prices. Initially refusing to further compromise the distressed price levels, political pressure from starving families across the country forced Congress to reconsider. With large deposits of grain already wasting away in government possession, the only political move left was to begin a process of donations to the hungry from the Farm Board, a federal oversight created in 1929 to promote the sale and stabilization of agricultural products. Instead of hunger being a reason for the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> large grain <b>surpluses,</b> waste became the eventual driving force.|$|R
