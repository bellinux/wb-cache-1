Identifying dimensions of environmental experience that are common to multiple types of adversity may be a more effective strategy. We examined the unique associations of two such dimensions—threat and cognitive deprivation—with <b>automatic</b> emotion <b>regulation</b> and cognitive control using a multivariate approach that simultaneously examined both dimensions of adversity. Data were drawn from a community sample of adolescents (N= 287) with variability in exposure to violence—an indicator of threat, and poverty—which is associated with cognitive deprivation. Adolescents completed tasks measuring <b>automatic</b> emotion <b>regulation</b> and cognitive control in neutral and emotional contexts. Violence was associated with <b>automatic</b> emotion <b>regulation</b> deficits, but not cognitive control; poverty was associated with poor cognitive control, but not <b>automatic</b> emotion <b>regulation.</b> Both violence and poverty predicted poor inhibition in an emotional context. Utilizing either an approach focused on single types of adversity or cumulative risk obscured specificity in the associations of violence and poverty with emotional and cognitive outcomes. These findings suggest that different dimensions of childhood adversity have distinct influences on development and highlight the utility of a differentiated multivariate approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{investigate}} how <b>automatic</b> emotion <b>regulation</b> altered the hemispheric asymmetry of ERPs elicited by emotion processing. We examined the effect of individual differences in <b>automatic</b> emotion <b>regulation</b> on the late positive potential (LPP) when participants were viewing blocks of positive high arousal, positive low arousal, negative high arousal and negative low arousal pictures from International affect picture system (IAPS). Two participant groups were categorized by the Emotion Regulation-Implicit Association Test which has been used in previous research to identify two groups of participants with automatic emotion control and with automatic emotion express. The main finding was that automatic emotion express group showed a right dominance of the LPP component at posterior electrodes, especially in high arousal conditions. But no right dominance of the LPP component was observed for automatic emotion control group. We also found the group with automatic emotion control showed no differences in the right posterior LPP amplitude between high- and low-arousal emotion conditions, while the participants with automatic emotion express showed larger LPP amplitude in the right posterior in high-arousal conditions compared to low-arousal conditions. This result suggested that AER (<b>Automatic</b> emotion <b>regulation)</b> modulated the hemispheric asymmetry of LPP on posterior electrodes and supported the right hemisphere hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to explore the effects of <b>automatic</b> emotion <b>regulation</b> on the desirability bias. The desirability bias is the tendency to believe that one will experience desirable outcomes and not experience undesirable outcomes. Previous {{research has demonstrated that}} the desirability bias is due to affective reactions to potential events. Further, deliberate emotion regulation has been shown to reduce the desirability bias. The present investigation explored whether the desirability bias can be reduced by priming a nonconscious goal to regulate emotion before experience of affective reactions to an event. Participants were primed to either express or regulate their emotions before playing a game of chance where cards could result in positive, negative or neutral outcomes. Results showed that the method of priming emotion regulation or expression did not effectively elicit nonconscious goals. Because the manipulation was not effective, the effect of <b>automatic</b> emotion <b>regulation</b> on the desirability bias could not be examined and there was no effect of the prime on bias. Despite the failed manipulation, the findings are still beneficial to the desirability bias literature in that they demonstrate a clear desirability bias in participants' predictions {{with the use of a}} within-subjects design. A follow up study using a stronger prime of regulation to test the influence of <b>automatic</b> emotion <b>regulation</b> in reducing the desirability bias is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The three-element {{system for}} {{automatic}} water-level regulation in the boiler shell {{as well as}} its modifications received maximal dissimilation in the Republic of Belarus and the CIS countries power economies. Though, they possess the following shortages: occurrence of the steadystate errors {{at the end of the}} transient process during the control response to internal disturbances and those by over-heated steam; large level deviations at sharp and significant load changes, which often leads to the boiler or the power block deloading or stoppage. As a remedial action against the mentioned disadvantages, the invariant systems for the drum boiler automatic feed regulation were developed earlier. The first variant of the <b>automatic</b> <b>regulation</b> invariant system with the equivalent external disturbance individualization differs from the typical one in the way that they select the stabilizing controller arrangement on the basis of transmission response of the optimal controller. And the compensating device dynamic settings structure and parameters are chosen with respect to the equivalent controlled member including the stabilizing controller inner contour. The second variant offers the compensating device transmission response to the equivalent external disturbance represented as series-connected typical sections: a real differentiator and a quick-response unit. For the control action maximum value reducing in this scheme, there is a suppressing device additionally installed at the exit of the equivalent external disturbance compensation device. The <b>automatic</b> <b>regulation</b> invariant systems eliminate steady-state errors at all impacts and allow improving significantly the level control quality at variable conditions.

The results strongly and consistently indicated that acute social exclusion increased nonconscious positive affect. Compared to nonexcluded participants, excluded participants recalled more positive memories from childhood than did accepted participants (Experiment 1), gave greater weight to positive emotion in their judgments of word similarity (Experiments 2 and 3), and completed more ambiguous word stems with happy words (Experiments 4 a and 4 b). This process was apparently automatic, as participants asked to imagine exclusion overestimated explicit distress and underestimated implicit positivity (Experiment 3). Four final experiments showed that this <b>automatic</b> emotion <b>regulation</b> process was found among participants low (but not high) in depressive symptoms (Experiments 5 and 6) and among participants high (but not low) in self-esteem (Experiments 7 and 8).
