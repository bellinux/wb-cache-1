'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. I think {{what you want to}} watch as an opener is not getting out... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E
5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> it was going. I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E

Any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors. Trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work. Each element depends on all the others.|$|E

500|$|The city of Paterson, New Jersey, {{renamed the}} Eastside Park {{baseball}} field [...] "Larry Doby Field" [...] on June 1, 2002. The Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center has a section named the Larry Doby Wing. Of Berra, Doby said, [...] "Yogi {{was one of}} the first opposing players to talk to me. As a catcher, Yogi talked to everybody. I finally had to tell the umpire: 'Please tell him to shut up. He <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> my family was back in the first inning.'" [...] In 2011, the U.S. Postal Service announced that Doby would be one of the four baseball players (along with Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, and Willie Stargell) to appear on a postage stamp in 2012, as part of its [...] "Major League Baseball All-Stars" [...] series. The stamp was released July 21, 2012.|$|E
500|$|The Kinks' next single, [...] "Waterloo Sunset", was {{released}} in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to {{have been inspired by}} the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, [...] "It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world {{and they were going to}} emigrate and go to another country." [...] Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for [...] "Waterloo Sunset" [...] lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: [...] "We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while." [...] The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Makers chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it [...] "the most beautiful song in the English language", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as [...] "possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era".|$|E

[...] "Maria Callas once <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> I ever got through it, but Toscanini wanted it that way," [...] Albanese later recalled. [...] "'It should be like champagne,' he said. I complained to him, and he said, 'You can do it.' Before I sang the part, I went to a hospital to study the behavior of people with tuberculosis and I learned that sometimes they can be hysterical." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the author's {{note to the}} Christmas 1896 {{edition of}} Through the Looking-Glass Carroll writes, [...] "The new words, in the poem Jabberwocky, {{have given rise to}} some {{differences}} of opinion as to their pronunciation, so it may be well to give instructions on that point also. Pronounce 'slithy' {{as if it were the}} two words, 'sly, thee': make the 'g' hard in 'gyre' and 'gimble': and pronounce 'rath' to rhyme with 'bath.'" [...] In the Preface to The Hunting of the Snark, Carroll wrote, [...] " [...] me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been <b>asked</b> <b>me,</b> <b>how</b> to pronounce [...] "slithy toves." [...] The [...] "i" [...] in [...] "slithy" [...] is long, as in [...] "writhe", and [...] "toves" [...] is pronounced so as to rhyme with [...] "groves." [...] Again, the first [...] "o" [...] in [...] "borogoves" [...] is pronounced like the [...] "o" [...] in [...] "borrow." [...] I have heard people try to give it the sound of the [...] "o" [...] in [...] "worry." [...] Such is Human Perversity." ...|$|E
2500|$|I had {{a terrific}} {{friendship}} with Sheila Florance. In fact she acted in {{my very first}} film, and we always used to joke that I would make her a star. When I heard suddenly that she was dying of cancer I visited her immediately. There was no sentimentality or anything on her part—she was an incredible woman—but she said jokingly, 'There is still time to turn me into a star, but let's be quick.' I went home and spent three days and three nights writing the script and then with Barry Dickins and Sheila we did another draft. She was given eight weeks to live and so we made A Woman's Tale with this hanging over us. This motivated us, of course, but Sheila had a degree of greatness about her. She was a very powerful woman. It was an amazing challenge {{to make a film}} about life, in the face of death. To get the money of course was impossible and I had to pawn everything I had. People have <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> we did it but to some extent we were idiotically courageous in taking this risk. Sheila and I joked all the time. I would say to Sheila, [...] "Please don't die on me or you'll kill me". She would reply, [...] "Don't worry I'll be a good girl." ...|$|E
