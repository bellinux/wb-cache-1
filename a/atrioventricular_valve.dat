25|$|The {{coronary}} arteries {{start in the}} right and left aortic sinus and provide blood to the heart muscle in a similar fashion to most other vertebrates. Other domestic birds capable of flight have three or more {{coronary arteries}} that supply blood to the heart muscle. The blood supply by the coronary arteries are fashioned starting as a large branch over the surface of the heart. It then moves along the coronary groove and continues on into the tissue as interventricular branches toward the apex of the heart. The atria, ventricles, and septum are supplied of blood by this modality. The deep branches of the coronary arteries found within the heart tissue are small and supply the interventricular and right <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> with blood nutrients for which to carry out their processes.

50|$|The mitral valve, {{also known}} as the {{bicuspid}} valve or left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve,</b> is a dual-flap valve in the heart that lies between the left atrium and the left ventricle.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{differential}} {{insertion of}} the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valves</b> is the ultrasonographic {{representation of the}} more apical attachment of the tricuspid valve to the septum {{with respect to the}} mitral valve. A linear insertion is present when both valves form a linear continuum and has been suggested as a marker for atrioventricular septal defects (AVSDs). The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the anatomical substratum of differential and linear insertions of the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valves</b> in normal fetal hearts and fetal hearts with an AVSD. METHODS: The extent and position of the fibrous skeleton and attachment of the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valves</b> to the septum were studied in histological sections of 17 normal hearts and four hearts with an AVSD from 10 + 0 weeks' gestation to 3 days postpartum with various immunohistochemical tissue markers. In addition, spatiotemporal image correlation (STIC) volumes of 10 normal hearts and STIC volumes of eight hearts with an AVSD at 13 + 6 to 35 + 5 weeks' gestation were examined. RESULTS: The differential insertion of the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valves</b> was visible in normal hearts in the four-chamber plane immediately beneath the aorta, but nearer the diaphragm a linear insertion was found. In hearts with an AVSD, a linear appearance was observed in the four-chamber plane immediately beneath the aorta. Towards the diaphragm, however, first a differential insertion and, more caudally, a linear insertion was found. CONCLUSIONS: Both differential and linear insertions can be found in normal fetal hearts and fetal hearts with AVSD, depending on the plane in which the four-chamber view is visualized. Therefore, measurement of the differential insertion is likely to be useful only in experienced hands. Copyright (c) 2014 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{outcome of}} {{surgical}} correction of atrioventricular septal defect with double-orifice left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> has improved {{in recent years}} but is still reported {{to be associated with}} high mortality and reoperation rates. Controversy exists about the management of the accessory orifice. We evaluated our results with correction of atrioventricular septal defect with double-orifice left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve.</b> MethodsBetween 1975 and 2006, 21 patients underwent correction of atrioventricular septal defect with double-orifice left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve.</b> Clinical data were obtained by means of retrospectively reviewing inpatient and outpatient medical records. To evaluate the influence of double-orifice left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> on mortality and the need for reoperation, a comparison was made with 291 consecutive patients who, during the same period, underwent correction of atrioventricular septal defect without double-orifice left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve.</b> ResultsNone of the 21 patients with double-orifice left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> had undergone a previous operation. The accessory orifice was managed with different techniques depending on the severity of the regurgitation. There was no in-hospital mortality, and there were 3 late deaths. Seven patients required 12 reoperations, 7 for left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> insufficiency. Double-orifice left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> had no influence on mortality but was a significant predictor for reoperation compared with repair of atrioventricular septal defect without double-orifice left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve.</b> At the latest follow-up, all 18 survivors were in New York Heart Association functional class І without medication. Only 1 patient showed residual mild left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> insufficiency. ConclusionAtrioventricular septal defect with double-orifice left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> can be repaired with low mortality. However, double-orifice left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> is a predictor for reoperation. The accessory orifice is often competent and should then be left untouched.

Objective:To determine factors associated with moderate or severe left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation within 30 days of surgical repair of complete atrioventricular septal defect. Methods:We assessed the results of 53 consecutive patients 3 years-old and younger presenting with complete atrioventricular septal defect that were operated on at our practice between 2002 and 2010. The following variables were considered: age, weight, absence of Down syndrome, grade of preoperative <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation, abnormalities on the left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> {{and the use of}} annuloplasty. Median age was 6. 7 months; median weight was 5. 3 Kg; 86. 8 % had Down syndrome. At the time of preoperative evaluation, there were 26 cases with moderate or severe left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation (49. 1 %). Abnormalities on the left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> were found in 11. 3 %; annuloplasty was performed in 34 % of the patients.

After performing a multivariate analysis, the only significant factor associated with moderate or severe left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation was the absence of Down syndrome (P= 0. 03).

Objective:To determine factors associated with moderate or greater left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation within 30 days of surgical repair of incomplete atrioventricular septal defect. Methods:We assessed the results of 51 consecutive patients 14 years-old and younger presenting with incomplete atrioventricular septal defect that were operated on at our practice between 2002 and 2010. The following variables were considered: age, weight, absence of Down syndrome, grade of preoperative left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation, abnormalities on the left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> {{and the use of}} annuloplasty. The median age was 4. 1 years; the median weight was 13. 4 Kg; 37. 2 % had Down syndrome. At the time of preoperative evaluation, there were 23 cases with moderate or greater left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation (45. 1 %). Abnormalities on the left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> were found in 17. 6 %; annuloplasty was performed in 21. 6 %. Results:At the time of postoperative evaluation, there were 12 cases with moderate or greater left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation (23. 5 %). The variation between pre- and postoperative grades of left <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation of patients with <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>valve</b> malformation did not reach significance (P= 0. 26), unlike patients without such abnormalities (P= 0. 016).
