5|$|Since {{at least}} the 1870s, <b>American</b> <b>religious,</b> medical, legislative, and legal {{commentators}} have debated contraception laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel have found that in these discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, {{as part of an}} ongoing attempt to regulate human bodies. In press coverage between 1873–2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} opponent to birth control was the Catholic Church, which mobilized opposition in many venues during the 1920s. Catholics persuaded the Syracuse city council to ban Sanger from {{giving a speech}} in 1924; the National Catholic Welfare Conference lobbied against birth control; the Knights of Columbus boycotted hotels that hosted birth control events; the Catholic police commissioner of Albany prevented Sanger from speaking there; the Catholic mayor of Boston, James Curley, blocked Sanger from speaking in public; and several newsreel companies, succumbing to pressure from Catholics, refused to cover stories related to birth control.Chesler, p. 220 (newsreels). The ABCL turned some of the boycotted speaking events to their advantage by inviting the press, and the resultant news coverage often generated public sympathy for their cause. However, Catholic lobbying was particularly effective in the legislative arena, where their arguments– that contraception was unnatural, harmful, and indecent– impeded several initiatives, including an attempt in 1924 by Mary Dennett to overturn federal anti-contraception laws.For a detailed discussion of religious objection to birth control, see: Tobin, Kathleen (2001), The <b>American</b> <b>Religious</b> Debate Over Birth Control, 1907–1937, McFarland.|$|E
