5|$|Space Invaders {{was created}} by Tomohiro Nishikado, who spent a year {{designing}} the game and developing the necessary hardware to produce it. The game's inspiration {{is reported to have}} come from varying sources, including an adaptation of the mechanical game Space Monsters released by Taito in 1972, and a dream about Japanese school children who are waiting for Santa Claus and are attacked by invading aliens. However, Nishikado has cited Atari's arcade game Breakout as his inspiration. He aimed to create a shooting game that featured the same sense of achievement from completing stages and destroying targets, but with more complex graphics. Nishikado used a similar layout to that of Breakout but altered the game mechanics. Rather than bounce a ball to attack static objects, players are given the ability to fire projectiles <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>discretion</b> to attack moving enemies.|$|E

Skiers from 39 different countries actively compete in para-alpine skiing in a sport {{is that one of}} eight governed by the International Paralympic Committee Sports Committee, with rules for para-alpine skiing set forth in the IPCAS Rules and Regulations. Event specific rules may be created for events like the Paralympic Games. One set of rules was created in 1994 and were specified in the IPC Handbook. This was used to govern IPC-sanctioned events like the Paralympic Games for many years. Competition rules for classes use rules set by or modified from rules created by the International Ski Federation (ISF). These rules were set at the 42nd International Ski Conference in 2000. The two rule sets worked in concert with each other, with the ISF rules specifying the rules for alpine skiing, and the IPC providing modifications for para-alpine skiing. The IPC Alpine Sports Assembly Executive Committee can determine if skiers are eligible to compete in IPC sanctioned events <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>discretion</b> regardless of what the rules say.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about how the front-staff in two service {{companies}} experience empowerment. Competition for business in today's society is becoming increasingly fierce, {{which means that they}} {{must find a way to}} differentiate themselves from competitors. Service has become a way to compete. Front-staff competence and ability to offer a good service is a crucial factor when the company's success is being measured. Empowerment in business is used as a tool to create motivation and satisfaction of individuals at work. Companies using empowerment can create the freedom and opportunities for employees to act <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> intelligence and <b>discretion.</b> By letting staff take advantage of leadership power can improve service quality because the staff is given the freedom and opportunity to act. To achieve this, companies should look to the need to educate, develop and motivate their staff so that they feel confident in meeting service. Empowerment can exist in different degrees and in different dimensions depending on the variation and standardization of the task. A standardized company is not given as much capacity for empowerment. Empowerment has both advantages and disadvantages that may affect staff as well as company performance and wellbeing. For empowerment to exist in an adequate way, it is important to ensure that the front-staff perceive the responsibilities and power that the management gives them. With this as background, we have by means of a qualitative research methodology interviewed eight respondents in the two service companies where empowerment exists in different degrees. An intense study characterizes the paper, because the interest is to go deep in the investigation and study the individual's perception. The research question is: "How does the front staff in service-oriented companies experience empowerment?"Purpose of this essay is therefore to compare how empowerment affects frontline staff in service businesses, to see if there are similarities and differences in how front-staff perceive the empowerment, depending on the degree of standardization in the company. We have summarized our findings in three main points:  Empowerment has both positive and negative effects that can exist at the same time  The experience of empowerment is dependent on trust and security in the workplace  Empowerment should be adapted to the compan...|$|R

This had led to a situation where workers who could not count on a Western-style meritocracy (where they might expect to find their pay and conditions improve with promotions) would instead have to rely on the decisions of managers to give bonuses and overtime payments if they wanted to increase their wages.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Since the early fifties “open form” has become a generic description for many different compositional concepts having in common musical outcomes which {{to a certain degree}} are indeterminate. The introduction looks into different meanings given to “form” in music and gives a historical survey of the origins of compositional indeterminacy. Next, the concept of “open form” is elaborated into a territory which is usually not associated with it: jazz. The introduction is followed by five case studies. Folio (1952 - 54) by Earle Brown is considered to contain the first intentionally “open form” works. It is driven by improvisational ideas, either at the compositional stage or at the interpretative stage. Brown's affinity with jazz also offers connections to other topics of the thesis. Miles Davis' Ife (1972) may at first seem like an odd inclusion in this study, but it is not. Its only oddity could be that of all the works discussed it has no score. But it is a composition; it is recognizable throughout its various incarnations and repeatable, and its outcome is indeterminate. Adam Rudolph did not conceive Ostinatos of Circularity as an “open form” work, but it is an indeterminate composition: it does have a score the musical result of which depends on the decisions made by the composer/conductor during the performance as well as the choices made by the performers. In Peter Zummo's Experimenting with Household Chemicals the performers play the same, often ambiguous, score, moving in the same direction <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> speed and <b>discretion.</b> The lack of synchronicity and the ambiguous notation result in a very elastic organic form. Anne La Berge refers to her recent works as “guided improvisations”. The scores mainly consist of suggestive text materials, software preset descriptions and rudimentary verbal indications, leaving major decisions to the performers. The last chapter is about my own work. It presents seven works (the scores of which {{can be found in the}} accompanying portfolio), composed between 2007 and 2011. Each of these works uses the score as a “field” through which the performers roam...|$|R

This simulcast allowed Sun News to reach audiences in the Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton and London areas (the latter three cities through repeaters), either through the CKXT broadcast signal or {{cable and satellite}} services that were compelled to carry CKXT's signal. Some carriers outside those areas also carried CKXT <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>discretion.</b> Though Quebecor had intended to return the CKXT licence in exchange for Sun News, it made a February 2011 filing to the CRTC requesting to continue CKXT's operations past the August 2011 digital conversion.

On July 5, 2011, the CRTC told Quebecor {{it would have to}} justify its practice of using an over-the-air signal to rebroadcast a specialty channel; Quebecor responded on July 15 that it would agree to surrender the CKXT licence to the CRTC. As a result, Sun News' CKXT simulcast ended on November 1, 2011, when the main Toronto signal was turned off along with the Hamilton and London repeaters (the Ottawa repeater was shut off on August 31).|$|E

Balancing her new job, her family, and trying to rebuild her love life is not easy, but she keeps trying. She makes a name for herself in family court for her unusual methods and sentences and her stubbornness, which sometimes gets her in trouble. She dates several men. Her longest and more serious relationships are with lawyer Stuart Collins and David McClaren. Amy and Stuart dislike each other at first, but when she asks him to be Eric Black's lawyer, they get closer and eventually get engaged. However, Amy leaves him at the altar on their wedding day, saying he has a way of always convincing her to do things she does not want to do, calling him [...] "a bully". She meets David McClaren during her short stint in the criminal court, and things are rocky from the start. Amy becomes pregnant by him and they plan to marry, but things fall apart when she miscarries and they part ways soon thereafter.
