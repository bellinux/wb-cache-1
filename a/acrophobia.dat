5|$|On {{the way to}} Seville, Kabir drops Natasha at the airport, while Arjun and Imran {{notice that}} {{something}} is wrong between them. Imran later reassures his friends that everything is okay. The trio visit Seville for sky diving, Arjun's choice. During the task, Imran is forced to confront his <b>acrophobia</b> and hesitates to take part. However, they complete it without any obstacles. After skydiving, the three men go to a bar and get into a fight with a stranger on whom they had tried to pull a prank. They are jailed after the fight. After Laila and Nuria do not answer their calls to bail them out, Imran reluntantly proceeds to call Salman Habib. Salman bails them out and takes them to his home. While speaking to Imran, Salman reveals that he never wanted the responsibility of a married life with kids, while Imran's mother did, which is why he never contacted Imran. Imran, heartbroken, realises how his actions must have hurt Arjun four years back. He earnestly apologises to Arjun, and Arjun, seeing the genuineness of the apology, forgives him with a hug.|$|E
25|$|Virtual Reality Immersion Therapy or VRIT is {{a method}} using {{specially}} encoded virtual environments and computers to evaluate and treat anxiety disorders such as <b>acrophobia</b> or PTSD. Conceived in the early 1990s by Dr. Ralph Lamson, VRIT was clinically proven and the key patent 6,425,764 was filed in 1997 for this major contribution to treatment of medical conditions involving sensory induced disorders by recreating such sensations {{in a controlled manner}} in an immersive virtual environment with feedback to achieve mastery over the causative sensations.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} Scottie follows Madeleine; they meet {{and spend the}} day together. They travel to Muir Woods and Cypress Point on 17-Mile Drive, where Madeleine runs down towards the ocean. Scottie grabs her and they embrace. Madeleine recounts a {{nightmare}} and Scottie identifies its setting as Mission San Juan Bautista, childhood home of Carlotta. He drives her there and they express their love for each other. Madeleine suddenly runs into the church and up the bell tower. Scottie, halted on the steps by his <b>acrophobia,</b> sees Madeleine plunge to her death.|$|E
25|$|At Pixy Cove, Poirot {{and police}} find {{a pair of}} new scissors, a {{fragment}} of pipe that could belong to many smokers, and heroin hidden in a cave (which turns out {{to belong to the}} heroin-smuggling Sir Horace Blatt). Inside the cave, Poirot also sniffs a delicate exclusive perfume only used by Arlena and Rosamund. Poirot invites everyone on a picnic to test their vertigo. Christine and Emily both claimed fear of heights (<b>acrophobia),</b> but Christine easily traverses the bridge – thus she lied. After the picnic, Linda is found overdosed on six of Christine's sleeping pills, and almost dies. She has written a confession but Poirot finds her library book about magic, melted wax and a pin, and realises she mistook piercing a voodoo image for murder. Christine made sure her tablets were handy, provoking the guilt-ridden Linda to take them.|$|E
25|$|Fear can {{be learned}} by {{experiencing}} or watching a frightening traumatic accident. For example, if a child falls into a well and struggles to get out, {{he or she may}} develop a fear of wells, heights (<b>acrophobia),</b> enclosed spaces (claustrophobia), or water (aquaphobia). There are studies looking at areas of the brain that are affected in relation to fear. When looking at these areas (such as the amygdala), it was proposed that a person learns to fear regardless of whether they themselves have experienced trauma, or if they have observed the fear in others. In a study completed by Andreas Olsson, Katherine I. Nearing and Elizabeth A. Phelps the amygdala were affected both when subjects observed someone else being submitted to an aversive event, knowing that the same treatment awaited themselves, and when subjects were subsequently placed in a fear-provoking situation. This suggests that fear can develop in both conditions, not just simply from personal history.|$|E
25|$|An early {{exploration}} in 1993–1994 of VRT {{was done by}} Ralph Lamson a USC graduate then at Kaiser Permanente Psychiatry Group. Lamson began publishing his work in 1993. As a psychologist, he was most concerned with the medical and therapeutic aspects, that is, how to treat people using the technology, rather than the apparatus, which was obtained from Division, Inc. Psychology Today reported in 1994 that these 1993–1994 treatments were successful in about 90% of Lamson's virtual psychotherapy patients. Lamson wrote in 1993 a book entitled Virtual Therapy {{which was published in}} 1997 directed primarily to the detailed explanation of the anatomical, medical and therapeutic basis for the success of VRT. In 1994–1995, he had solved his own <b>acrophobia</b> in a test use of a third party VR simulation and then set up a 40 patient test funded by Kaiser Permanente. Shortly thereafter, in 1994–1995, Larry Hodges, then a computer scientist at Georgia Tech active in VR, began studying VRT in cooperation with Max North who had reported anomalous behavior in flying carpet simulation VR studies and attributed such to phobic response of unknown nature. Hodges tried to hire Lamson without success in 1994 and instead began working with Barbara Rothbaum, a psychologist at Emory University to test VRT in controlled group tests, experiencing about 70% success among 50% of subjects completing the testing program.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Skip Rizzo of USC's Institute for Creative Technologies, with {{research}} {{funding from the}} Office of Naval Research (ONR), started validating a tool he created using assets from the game Full Spectrum Warrior {{for the treatment of}} posttraumatic stress disorder. Virtual Iraq was subsequently evaluated and improved under ONR funding and is supported by Virtually Better, Inc. They also support applications of VR-based therapy for aerophobia, <b>acrophobia,</b> glossophobia, and substance abuse. Virtual Iraq proved successful in normalization of over 70% of PTSD sufferers, and that has now become a standard accepted treatment by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. However, the VA has continued to emphasize traditional prolonged exposure therapy as the treatment of choice, and VR-based therapies have gained only limited adoption, despite active promotion by DOD. This is interesting in view of VRT having much lower cost and apparently higher success rates, and a $12-million ONR funded study is currently underway to definitively compare the efficacy of the two methods, PET and VRT. Military labs have subsequently set up dozens of VRT labs and treatment centers for treating both PTSD {{and a variety of other}} medical conditions. The use of VRT has thus become a mainstream psychiatric treatment for anxiety disorders and is finding increasing use in the treatment of other cognitive disorders associated with various medical conditions such as addiction, depression and insomnia.|$|E

500|$|A mutant {{capable of}} {{emitting}} incredibly strong ultrasonic screams, sonic blasts, sonic bursts, and sonic waves used {{in various ways}} including {{as a means of}} flight. Jones auditioned without knowing what X-Men character he was up for, saying he auditioned because it was a superhero that fit his biotype: [...] "I've got red hair and freckles, I'm not gonna be Batman, Robin or Spider-Man". The actor also stated that the script defined the character more than the comics, as Banshee went through various reinventions in print. Given Banshee gets involved with MacTaggert in the comics, Jones also tried to [...] "look at her just a little bit differently, you know, when I can." [...] As Jones suffers from <b>acrophobia,</b> using the rig that was to depict Banshee's flight required much preparation time with the stunt team.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} shot on {{location}} in San Francisco, California, and at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. It is the first film to use the dolly zoom, an in-camera effect that distorts perspective to create disorientation, to convey Scottie's <b>acrophobia.</b> As {{a result of its}} use in this film, the effect {{is often referred to as}} [...] "the Vertigo effect".|$|E
2500|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} Judy {{was the person}} Scottie knew as [...] "Madeleine Elster"; she was impersonating Gavin's wife {{as part of a}} murder plot. Judy drafts a letter to Scottie explaining her involvement: Gavin had deliberately taken advantage of Scottie's <b>acrophobia</b> to substitute his wife's freshly killed body in the apparent [...] "suicide jump". But Judy rips up the letter and continues the charade, because she loves Scottie.|$|E
2500|$|The film stars James Stewart {{as former}} police detective John [...] "Scottie" [...] Ferguson. Scottie is forced into early {{retirement}} because {{an incident in}} the line of duty has caused him to develop <b>acrophobia</b> (an extreme fear of heights) and vertigo (a false sense of rotational movement). Scottie is hired by an acquaintance, Gavin Elster, as a private investigator to follow Gavin's wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), who is behaving strangely.|$|E
2500|$|There, {{he tells}} her he must re-enact the event {{that led to his}} madness, admitting he now understands that [...] "Madeleine" [...] and Judy are the same person. Scottie forces her up the bell tower and makes her admit her deceit. Scottie reaches the top, finally conquering his <b>acrophobia.</b> Judy confesses that Gavin paid her to {{impersonate}} a [...] "possessed" [...] Madeleine; Gavin faked the suicide by throwing the body of his wife from the bell tower.|$|E
2500|$|As {{chronicled in}} The Life of Python, The First 20 Years of Monty Python, and The Pythons' Autobiography, it was {{revealed}} that Chapman was suffering from <b>acrophobia,</b> trembling, and bouts of forgetfulness during filming. These were the results of Chapman's long-standing alcohol addiction, and he decided from that moment on to remain [...] "on an even keel" [...] while the production continued. Nearly three years after Holy Grail, Chapman vowed to quit drinking altogether (which he successfully achieved in December 1977).|$|E
2500|$|Henry {{suffers from}} suriphobia (fear of rats), similar to his son's fear of snakes, and, apparently, also from <b>acrophobia.</b> He {{also has a}} habit of saying [...] "This is intolerable!" [...] in {{particularly}} trying circumstances. When Indy punches a Nazi while on the tank, he shouts, [...] "You call this archaeology?!" [...] Throughout the film, Henry is shocked by his son's violent lifestyle, such as when he guns down a pair of Nazis, saying [...] "Look what you did! I can't believe what you did!" [...] He also is unimpressed when his son defeats their Nazi pursuers with only a pole during their escape on motorcycle. During the tank battle, though, he blows up a truck full of Nazis to Brody's horror, explaining [...] "It's war!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hitchcock's next film, Vertigo (1958) again starred James Stewart, {{this time}} with Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes. Stewart plays [...] "Scottie", a former police {{investigator}} suffering from <b>acrophobia,</b> who develops an obsession with a woman {{that he has been}} hired to shadow (Novak). Scottie's obsession leads to tragedy, and this time Hitchcock does not opt for a happy ending. Some critics, including Donald Spoto and Roger Ebert, agree that Vertigo represents the director's most personal and revealing film, dealing with the Pygmalion-like obsessions of a man who crafts a woman into the woman that he desires. Vertigo explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death than any other film in his filmography. Hitchcock, and Vertigo, were later paid homage-to in the 1977 Mel Brooks film High Anxiety.|$|E
2500|$|Randomized, tightly controlled, <b>acrophobia</b> {{treatment}} trials at Kaiser Permanente provided >90% effectiveness, {{conducted in}} 1993–94. (Ext. Ref.2, pg.71) Of 40 patients treated, 38 showed marked reduction in phobic reaction to heights and self-reported reaching their goals. Research found that VRT allows patients to achieve victory over virtual height situations {{they could not}} confront in real life, and that gradually increasing the height and danger in a virtual environment produced increasing victories and greater self-confidence in the patient that they could actually confront the situation in real life. [...] "Virtual therapy interventions empower people. The simulation technology of virtual reality lends itself to mastery oriented treatment... Rather than coping with threats, phobics manage progressively more threatening aspects in a computer generated environment... The range of applications can be extended by enhancing the realness and interactivity so that actions elicit reactions from the environments in which individuals immerse themselves" [...] (Ext. Ref.3, pg.331–332).|$|E
2500|$|After {{starring}} in Hitchcock's {{remake of the}} director's earlier production, The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), with Doris Day, Stewart starred, with Kim Novak, in what many consider Hitchcock's most personal film, Vertigo (1958). The movie starred Stewart as John [...] "Scottie" [...] Ferguson, a former police investigator suffering from <b>acrophobia,</b> who develops an obsession with a woman he is shadowing. Scottie's obsession inevitably leads {{to the destruction of}} everything he once had and believed in. Though the film is widely considered a classic today, Vertigo met with very mixed reviews and poor box-office receipts upon its release, and marked the last collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock. The director reportedly blamed the film's failure on Stewart looking too old to be Kim Novak's love interest, and cast Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill in North by Northwest (1959), a role Stewart had very much wanted. (Grant was actually four years older than Stewart but photographed much younger.) Critical appreciation of all three films continues to be strong. In 2012 Vertigo was ranked highest in the [...] Sight & Sound critics poll for the greatest films ever made, taking the title from long-standing favorite Citizen Kane.|$|E
