5|$|In a 1987 sermon Lefebvre, at age 81, {{experiencing}} failing health, {{announced his}} intention to consecrate <b>a</b> <b>bishop</b> to carry on his work after his death.

The legend does not state whether there had been bishops in Finland before his time or what happened after his death; it does not even mention his burial in Finland. The vita is so void of any concrete information about Finland {{that it could have}} been created anywhere. The Latin is scholastic and the grammar is in general exceptionally good.|$|E

5|$|Augustine {{established}} his episcopal see at Canterbury. It {{is not clear}} when and where Augustine was consecrated as <b>a</b> <b>bishop.</b> Bede, writing about a century later, states that Augustine was consecrated by the Frankish Archbishop Ætherius of Arles, Gaul (France) after the conversion of Æthelberht. Contemporary letters from Pope Gregory, however, refer to Augustine as <b>a</b> <b>bishop</b> before he arrived in England. A letter of Gregory's from September 597 calls Augustine <b>a</b> <b>bishop,</b> and one dated ten months later says Augustine had been consecrated on Gregory's command by bishops of the German lands. The historian R. A. Markus discusses the various theories of when and where Augustine was consecrated, and suggests he was consecrated before arriving in England, but argues the evidence does not permit deciding exactly where this took place.|$|E
5|$|De Iniusta {{states that}} St-Calais was {{brought before the}} king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, the king having confiscated the bishop's lands before the trial. At the trial St-Calais held that as <b>a</b> <b>bishop</b> {{he could not be}} tried in a secular court, and he refused to answer the accusations. Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{presented}} the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs, and thus St-Calais could be tried as a vassal, not as <b>a</b> <b>bishop.</b> St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse to answer the allegations. After numerous conferences and discussions, the court held that St-Calais could be tried as a vassal in a feudal court. St-Calais then appealed to Rome, but his request was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or the lands he held as <b>a</b> <b>bishop,</b> was forfeit.|$|E

5|$|If he accepts, and {{is already}} <b>a</b> <b>bishop,</b> he {{immediately}} takes office. If {{he is not}} <b>a</b> <b>bishop,</b> however, he must be first consecrated as one before he can assume office. If a priest is elected, the Cardinal Dean consecrates him bishop; if a layman is elected, then the Cardinal Dean first ordains him deacon, then priest, and only then consecrates him as bishop. Only after becoming <b>a</b> <b>bishop</b> does the pope-elect take office. These functions of the Dean are assumed, if necessary, by the sub-Dean, and if the sub-Dean is also impeded, they are assumed by the senior cardinal-bishop in attendance. In 2005 the Dean himself—Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger—was elected pope. In 2013, the Dean and sub-Dean were not in attendance (over the age limit), and these functions were assumed by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.|$|E

5000|$|The {{church has}} never been <b>a</b> <b>bishop's</b> seat, and {{therefore}} is not a cathedral in the English sense.

5|$|Sometime between 887 and 892, Alfred gave Asser {{the monastery}} of Exeter. Asser {{subsequently}} became Bishop of Sherborne, though {{the year of}} succession is unknown. Asser's predecessor as Bishop of Sherborne, Wulfsige, {{is known to have}} attested a charter sometime between 890 and 896. Asser's first appearance in the position is in 900, when he appears as a witness to a charter; hence the succession can only be dated to the years 890 to 900. In any event, Asser had already been <b>a</b> <b>bishop</b> prior to his appointment to the see of Sherborne, since Wulfsige is known to have received a copy of Alfred's Pastoral Care in which Asser is described as <b>a</b> <b>bishop.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is no {{historical}} record of <b>a</b> <b>Bishop</b> of Uppsala called Henry {{during the reign}} of King Eric (about 1156–1160). Early phases of the diocese remain obscure up to the point of Stefan, who was appointed as the archbishop in 1164.|$|E
