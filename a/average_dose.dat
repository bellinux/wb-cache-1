5|$|Most {{people with}} {{hypothyroidism}} symptoms and confirmed thyroxine deficiency {{are treated with}} a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as levothyroxine (L-thyroxine). In young and otherwise healthy people with overt hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; in the elderly and people with heart disease a lower starting dose is recommended to prevent over supplementation and risk of complications. Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher than <b>average</b> <b>dose.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background/Objective: The {{risks of}} low-dose {{ionizing}} radiation from radiology and nuclear medicine are not clearly determined. Effective dose to population {{is a very}} important factor in risk estimation. The study aimed to determine the effective dose from diagnostic radiation medi-cine in a northern province of Iran. Materials and Methods: Data about various radiologic and nuclear medicine procedures were collected from all radiology and nuclear medicine departments in Mazandaran Province (popu-lation = 2, 898, 031); and using the standard dosimetry tables, the total dose, dose per examination, and annual effective dose per capita as well as the annual gonadal dose per ca-pita were estimated. Results: 655, 730 radiologic examinations in a year’s period, lead to 1. 45 mSv, 0. 33 mSv and 0. 31 mGy as <b>average</b> effective <b>dose</b> per examination, annual <b>average</b> effective <b>dose</b> to member of the public, and annual <b>average</b> gonadal <b>dose</b> per capita, respectively. The frequency of medical radiologic examinations was 2, 262 examinations annually per 10, 000 members of population. However, the total number of nuclear medicine examinations in the same period was 7074, with 4. 37 mSv, 9. 6 &# 61549;Sv and 9. 8 &# 61549;Gy, as <b>average</b> effective <b>dose</b> per examination, an-nual <b>average</b> effective <b>dose</b> to member of the public and annual <b>average</b> gonadal <b>dose</b> per caput, respectively. The frequency of nuclear medicine examination was 24 examinations annu-ally per 10, 000 members of population. Conclusion: The <b>average</b> effective <b>dose</b> per examination was nearly similar to other studies. However, the <b>average</b> annual effective <b>dose</b> and annual <b>average</b> gonadal <b>dose</b> per capita were less than the similar values in other reports, which could be due to lesser number of radiation medicine examinations in the present study...|$|R

25|$|Similar {{results were}} {{obtained}} for a three-month period from September 2011: {{among a group of}} 36,767 residents in Fukushima city, 36,657 had been exposed to less than 1 millisievert, and the <b>average</b> <b>dose</b> was 0.26 millisieverts. For 10 residents, the readings ranged from 1.8 to 2.7 millisieverts, but these values are mostly believed to be related to usage errors (dosimeters left outside or exposed to X-ray luggage screening).|$|E
25|$|Another study {{assessed}} doxepin and nordoxepin metabolism in CYP2D6 ultra-rapid, extensive, {{and poor}} metabolizers following a single 75mg oral dose. They found {{up to more}} than 10-fold variation in total exposure to doxepin and nordoxepin between the different groups. The researchers suggested that in order to achieve equivalent exposure, based on an <b>average</b> <b>dose</b> of 100%, the dosage of doxepin might be adjusted to 250% in ultra-rapid metabolizers, 150% in extensive metabolizers, 50% in intermediate metabolizers, and 30% in poor metabolizers.|$|E

30|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the microspheres lodge in the vasculature and the corresponding heterogeneity of radiation dose has been implicated as an additional challenge in radioembolisation dosimetry. It is recognised that this heterogeneity leads to a greater sparing capacity of normal liver and thus tolerance of higher <b>average</b> <b>doses</b> due to the non-uniformity of the dose pattern [28, 29]. Fowler et al. acknowledged the importance of considering DVHs {{as opposed to just}} <b>average</b> lesion <b>dose</b> in order to take into account, to some extent, the heterogeneity in dose delivery across the lesion [10]. This has been further confirmed by Pasciak et al. [30] who recently found a correlation between D 70 and microsphere density, and also found that an increase in <b>average</b> tumour <b>dose</b> could compensate for poor uniformity effects.|$|R
30|$|However, the {{calculated}} <b>average</b> annual effective <b>dose</b> to any {{individual in the}} population group due to the ingestion of natural radionuclides in the medicinal plants is far below the <b>average</b> radiation <b>dose</b> of 0.3 mSv a- 1 received per head worldwide (UNSCEAR 2000).|$|R
25|$|A {{review of}} trials of {{phytosterols}} and/or phytostanols, <b>average</b> <b>dose</b> 2.15 g/day, reported {{an average of}} 9% lowering of LDL-cholesterol. In 2000, the Food and Drug Administration approved the labeling of foods containing specified amounts of phytosterol esters or phytostanol esters as cholesterol-lowering; in 2003, an FDA Interim Health Claim Rule extended that label claim to foods or dietary supplements delivering more than 0.8g/day of phytosterols or phytostanols. Some researchers, however, are concerned about diet supplementation with plant sterol esters and draw attention to lack of long-term safety data.|$|E
25|$|Total {{recorded}} doses {{to individual}} workers in Chernobyl recovery operations {{during the period}} through 1990 ranged from less than 10 millisieverts (less than 1 rem) to more than 1 sievert (100 rems), due primarily to external radiation. The <b>average</b> <b>dose</b> is estimated to have been 120 millisieverts (12 rem) and 85% of the recorded doses were between 20 and 500 millisieverts (2 to 50 rems). There are large uncertainties in these individual doses; estimates {{of the size of}} the uncertainty range from 50% to a factor of five and dose records for military personnel are thought to be biased toward high values. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) estimates the total collective dose to the total of about 530,000 recovery operations workers as about 60,000 person-sieverts (6,000,000 person-rem).|$|E
2500|$|This was {{evidenced}} by the radiation alarms that eventually sounded. However, since {{very little of the}} fission products released were solids at room temperature, very little radiological contamination was reported in the environment. No significant level of radiation was attributed to the TMI-2 accident outside of the TMI-2 facility. According to the Rogovin report, {{the vast majority of the}} radioisotopes released were the noble gases xenon and krypton. The report stated, [...] "During the course of the accident, approximately [...] of radioactive noble gases and [...] of radioiodines were released." [...] This resulted in an <b>average</b> <b>dose</b> of [...] to the two million people near the plant. The report compared this with the additional [...] per year received from living in a high altitude city such as Denver. As further comparison, a patient receives [...] from a chest X-ray – more than twice the <b>average</b> <b>dose</b> of those received near the plant. [...] Measures of beta radiation were excluded from the report.|$|E
30|$|Exclusion of the CTA data {{discussed}} above {{leaves us with}} only the data published by Nijkeuter et al. [24] and, therefore, CTA mean fetal doses of 0.013  mGy in the first trimester using recent multislice technology. For the second trimester no data remain to be discussed. However, as fetal size increases, the dose must be assumed to be somewhere {{between the first and}} third trimester data. In the third trimester at least two studies remain to give an <b>average</b> fetal <b>dose</b> of 0.06 – 0.14  mGy [22, 26]. These data are consistent with the <b>average</b> <b>doses</b> reported for the whole pregnancy, which range between 0.01 and 0.06  mGy [28 – 30].|$|R
40|$|This work aims at {{establishing}} {{a set of}} diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for various types of examinations performed in diagnostic and interventional radiology. The <b>average</b> <b>doses</b> for 257 types of radiological examinations were established during the 1998 nationwide survey on the exposure of the Swiss population by radiodiagnostics.

2500|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, dextromethorphan acts centrally (meaning that it acts on the brain) {{as opposed}} to locally (on the respiratory tract). It elevates the threshold for coughing, without inhibiting ciliary activity. Dextromethorphan is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and converted into the active metabolite dextrorphan in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6. The <b>average</b> <b>dose</b> necessary for effective antitussive therapy is between 10 and 45mg, depending on the individual. The International Society for the Study of Cough recommends [...] "an adequate first dose of medication is 60 mg in the adult and repeat dosing should be infrequent rather than the [...] recommended." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two main}} Van Allen belts – the inner belt and the outer belt – and a {{transient}} third belt. The inner belt is the more dangerous one, containing energetic protons. The outer one has less-dangerous low-energy electrons (Beta particles). The Apollo spacecraft passed through the inner belt {{in a matter of}} minutes and the outer belt in about [...] hours. The astronauts were shielded from the ionizing radiation by the aluminum hulls of the spacecraft. Furthermore, the orbital transfer trajectory from Earth to the Moon through the belts was chosen to lessen radiation exposure. Even Dr. James Van Allen, the discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belts, rebutted the claims that radiation levels were too harmful for the Apollo missions. Plait cited an <b>average</b> <b>dose</b> of less than 1rem (10mSv), which is equivalent to the ambient radiation received by living at sea level for three years. The total radiation received on the trip was about the same as allowed for workers in the nuclear energy field for a year and not much more than what Space Shuttle astronauts received.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Average</b> glandular <b>dose</b> {{calculation}} in mammography with Mo-Rh target-filter and dose calculation {{for different}} situations is accurate and fast. Material and Methods: In this research, first of all, x-ray spectra of a Mo target bombarded by a 28 keV electron beam {{with and without}} a Rh filter were calculated using the MCNP code. Then, we used the Sobol-Wu parameters to write a FORTRAN code to calculate <b>average</b> glandular <b>dose.</b> Results: <b>Average</b> glandular <b>dose</b> variation was calculated against the voltage of the mammographic x-ray tube for d = 5 cm, HVL= 0. 35 mm Al, and different value of g. Also, the results related to <b>average</b> glandular absorbed <b>dose</b> variation per unit roentgen radiation against the glandular fraction of breast tissue for kV = 28 and HVL = 0. 400 mmAl and different values of d are presented. Finally, <b>average</b> glandular <b>dose</b> against d for g = 60 % and three values of kV (23, 27, 35 kV) with corresponding HVLs have been calculated.

40|$|Background: Select {{trials of}} {{fructose}} overfeeding {{have been used}} to implicate fructose as a driver of cardiometabolic risk. Objective: We examined temporal trends of fructose dose in human controlled feeding trials of fructose and cardiometabolic risk. Methods: We combined studies from eight meta-analyses on fructose and cardiometabolic risk to assess the <b>average</b> fructose <b>dose</b> used in these trials. Two types of trials were identified: 1) substitution trials, in which energy from fructose was exchanged with equal energy from other carbohydrates, 2) addition trials, in which energy from fructose supplemented a diet compared to the diet alone.
