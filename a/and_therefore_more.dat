5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
5|$|Children, ages 11–17, {{volunteer}} to become altar servers {{not only to}} serve the church {{but also because it}} has always been looked upon as an honor. It is a chance for children to serve their priest and become closer to Jesus by being on the altar. In addition, it is an opportunity for them to try to make themselves more holy <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> worthy of the position.|$|E
5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Johnson ended with 1/85 from 21 overs and was the most uneconomical of the Australian bowlers, conceding runs {{at a rate of}} 4.04 per over while the others averaged 3.26. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket, make it more likely to spin <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> difficult for Australia to bat on.|$|E

50|$|Mafic magmas {{are more}} liable to flow, <b>and</b> are <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> likely to undergo {{periodic}} replenishment of a magma chamber. Because {{they are more}} fluid, crystal precipitation occurs much more rapidly, resulting in greater changes by fractional crystallisation. Higher temperatures also allow mafic magmas to assimilate wall rocks <b>more</b> readily <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> contamination is <b>more</b> common and better developed.|$|R
5|$|Meat {{was more}} {{expensive}} <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> prestigious. Game, {{a form of}} meat acquired from hunting, was common only on the nobility's tables. The most prevalent butcher's meats were pork, chicken and other domestic fowl; beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations; dried, smoked or salted {{they made their way}} far inland, but a wide variety of other saltwater and freshwater fish was also eaten.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape and}} {{dimensions}} of the proboscis have evolved to give different species a wider <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> advantageous diet. There is an allometric scaling relationship between body mass of Lepidoptera and length of proboscis from which an interesting adaptive departure is the unusually long-tongued sphinx moth Xanthopan morganii praedicta. Charles Darwin predicted the existence and proboscis length of this moth before its discovery based on {{his knowledge of the}} long-spurred Madagascan star orchid Angraecum sesquipedale.|$|E
5|$|Bowling {{for long}} periods caused McCool to {{continually}} tear a callus on his third finger, which he used to impart spin on the ball. As a result, Bradman felt compelled to leave {{him out of the}} Test matches, feeling that his finger {{would not be able to}} handle the necessarily long bowling spells. This decision was aided by England and Australia’s agreement to allow a new ball to be used every 55 overs, instead of the incumbent regulation of permitting a new ball for every 200 runs scored, which usually took longer than 55 overs. This meant the ball was in a shiny state more often, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> conducive to fast and swing bowling, so Bradman relied heavily on his pacemen. For the rest of his career, McCool was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning finger.|$|E

5|$|Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth (where {{the gills}} curve up {{to join the}} stipe but then, close to the stipe, the margin turns down again), and {{initially}} narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish-olive with bright orange edges. Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted {{on the walls of}} the cystidia, is found in the cytosol <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> readily diffusible. The gills are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe, and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe).|$|E
5|$|Hansell lectured on {{the theory}} of {{precision}} air attack throughout his life, particularly at the United States Air Force Academy and the Air War College. He authored three books on air strategy: The Air War Plan That Defeated Hitler (1972), The Strategic Air War Against Japan (1980), and Strategic Air War Against Germany and Japan: A Memoir (1986). Hansell continued to study modern weapons systems, becoming an advocate of the Strategic Defense Initiative and the B-2 Spirit bomber. However his main focus was in promoting technical advances in precision guided weapons to make precision bombing more practical <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> desirable as a military strategy.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, a {{tropical}} wave moved {{off the coast}} of Africa. Moving westward, the disturbance gradually organized until July10, at which point convection became more concentrated, and it is estimated Tropical Depression Five formed in the central tropical Atlantic that evening. Late on July11, it strengthened and was named Tropical Storm Emily. Initially forecast to strengthen rapidly and move west-northwest through the Greater Antilles, Emily instead moved almost due west toward the Windward Islands, remaining a moderate tropical storm. The storm languished while moving quickly west, and struggled with maintaining its form. Contrary to the normal occurrence that hurricanes leave a cold wake behind, Hurricane Dennis had made portions of the Caribbean Sea warmer, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> favorable for tropical cyclone development. Late on July13, Emily strengthened rapidly and reached hurricane strength while passing Tobago and entering the eastern Caribbean. On July14, Emily made landfall in northern Grenada with 90mph (145km/h) winds.|$|E

5|$|Oppenheimer, {{reviewing}} {{his options}} in early 1943, gave {{priority to the}} gun-type weapon, but as a hedge against the threat of pre-detonation, he created the E-5 Group at the Los Alamos Laboratory under Seth Neddermeyer to investigate implosion. Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> completely. It was decided that the plutonium gun would receive {{the bulk of the}} research effort, since it was the project with the least amount of uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium gun-type bomb could be more easily adapted from it.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form along linear {{bands of}} temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear, {{and are thus}} classified as baroclinic cyclones. Initially, cyclogenesis, or low pressure formation, occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak. The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants, where divergence ensues. The divergence causes air to rush out {{from the top of}} the air column. As mass in the column is reduced, atmospheric pressure at surface level (the weight of the air column) is reduced. The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone (a low pressure system). The lowered pressure acts to draw in air, creating convergence in the low-level wind field. Low-level convergence and upper-level divergence imply upward motion within the column, making cyclones tend to be cloudy. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves around the back of the cyclone. Meanwhile, its associated warm front progresses more slowly, as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> difficult to dislodge. Later, the cyclones occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front, forcing a tongue, or trowal, of warm air aloft. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken.|$|E

25|$|Rabbi Moshe Isserles (the Rema) {{holds that}} the {{definition}} according to the Jerusalem Talmud should be used, which includes within its precept {{the definition of the}} Babylonian Talmud.

25|$|The Golden Bridge. It {{was built}} by the British in 1881 across the Narmada River to improve access to traders and administrators to Bombay. The {{structure}} was built with rust-resistant iron, <b>and</b> <b>therefore,</b> <b>more</b> expensive than modern steel, lending to the name Golden Bridge. This bridge connects Bharuch and Ankleshwar.|$|E
25|$|The Mistralian orthography of Provençal {{is more or}} less phonemic but not diasystemic and {{is closer}} to the French {{spelling}} <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> specific to Provençal; its users are divided between the ones that think that Provençal is a part of Occitan and the ones that think that Provençal is a separate language.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol fuel: Some alcohols, mainly ethanol and methanol, {{can be used}} as fuel. Fuel {{performance}} can be increased in forced induction internal combustion engines by injecting alcohol into the air intake after the turbocharger or supercharger has pressurized the air. This cools the pressurized air, providing a denser air charge, which allows for more fuel, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> power.|$|E
25|$|The area of {{a drawing}} {{is the size of}} its {{smallest}} bounding box, relative to the closest distance between any two vertices. Drawings with smaller area are generally preferable to those with larger area, because they allow the features of the drawing to be shown at greater size <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> legibly. The aspect ratio of the bounding box may also be important.|$|E
25|$|Competition between parasites can be {{expected}} to favor faster reproducing <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> virulent parasites, by natural selection. Parasites whose life cycle involves the death of the host, to exit the present host and sometimes to enter the next, evolve to be more virulent, and may alter the behavior or other properties of the host to make it more vulnerable to predators.|$|E
