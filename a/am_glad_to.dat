25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E
500|$|Brig. Gen. Archer was {{captured}} in the fighting, the first general officer in Robert E. Lee's army to suffer that fate. Archer was most likely positioned around the 14th Tennessee when he {{was captured}} by Private Patrick Moloney of Company G., 2nd Wisconsin, [...] "a brave patriotic and fervent young Irishman." [...] Archer resisted capture, but Moloney overpowered him. Moloney was killed later that day, but he received the Medal of Honor for his exploit. When Archer {{was taken to the}} rear, he encountered his former Army colleague Gen. Doubleday, who greeted him good-naturedly, [...] "Good morning, Archer! How are you? I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> see you!" [...] Archer replied, [...] "Well, I am not glad to see you by a damn sight!" ...|$|E
500|$|Joseph {{returned}} as a featured instrumentalist during Yanni's 2003 Ethnicity world tour, and wrote his sixth album on stage after sound checks. The Journey Continues, {{a sequel to}} Solo Journey, features Joseph on solo piano. [...] Debbage writes, [...] "The magical world of movies {{has a knack for}} exploring sequels. There is the beauty and beast effect when taking this pathway. The creative beauty allows the viewers to see the continued growth of its characters. The beastly aspect of this exploration is the Hollywood exploitation of an almost guaranteed return on its investment with no regard for its creative progression that usually sees diminishing returns. Bradley Joseph has decided to walk this tightrope by following up with Solo Journey that was released back in 2000. I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> report that The Journey Continues is entrenched in beauty, holding up well to its predecessor." ...|$|E

500|$|Edward {{became ill}} during January 1553 with a fever and cough that {{gradually}} worsened. The imperial ambassador, Jean Scheyfve, reported that [...] "he suffers {{a good deal}} when the fever is upon him, especially from a difficulty in drawing his breath, {{which is due to}} the compression of the organs on the right side". Edward felt well enough in early April to take the air in the park at Westminster and to move to Greenwich, {{but by the end of}} the month he had weakened again. By 7 May he was [...] "much amended", and the royal doctors had no doubt of his recovery. A few days later the king was watching the ships on the Thames, sitting at his window. However, he relapsed, and on 11 June Scheyfve, who had an informant in the king's household, reported that [...] "the matter he ejects from his mouth is sometimes coloured a greenish yellow and black, sometimes pink, like the colour of blood". Now his doctors believed he was suffering from [...] "a suppurating tumour" [...] of the lung and admitted that Edward's life was beyond recovery. Soon, his legs became so swollen that he had to lie on his back, and he lost the strength to resist the disease. To his tutor John Cheke he whispered, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> die".|$|E
500|$|As a toddler, little Maria once {{escaped from}} her bath and ran naked {{up and down}} the palace {{corridor}} while her distracted Irish nurse, Margaretta Eagar, who loved politics, discussed the Dreyfus Affair with a friend. [...] "Fortunately, I arrived just at that moment, picked her up and carried her back to Miss Eagar, who was still talking about Dreyfus," [...] recalled her aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia. Her older sisters objected to including Maria in their games and once referred to Maria as their [...] "stepsister" [...] because she was so good and never got into trouble, recalled Margaretta Eagar in her own memoirs. However, on occasion the sweet-natured Maria could be mischievous. Once, as a little girl, she stole some biscuits from her mother's tea table. As a punishment for her surprising behavior, the governess and Alexandra suggested she be sent to bed; however Nicholas objected, stating, [...] "I was always afraid of the wings growing. I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> see she is only a human child." [...] Eagar noted that Maria's love for her father was [...] "marked" [...] and she often tried to escape from the nursery to [...] "go to Papa." [...] When the Tsar was ill with typhoid, the little girl covered a miniature portrait of him with kisses every night.|$|E

2500|$|General Ely S. Parker, {{a member}} of the Seneca tribe, created the {{articles}} of surrender which General Robert E. Lee signed at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. Gen. Parker, who served as Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's military secretary and was a trained attorney, was once rejected for Union military service because of his race. At Appomattox, Lee is said to have remarked to Parker, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> see one real American here", to which Parker replied, [...] "We are all Americans." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{usefulness}} of a well established radio station open to full and frank discussion of great {{economic and social}} issues is beyond doubt. Past experience combines with common sense in assuring us that the commercial broadcasting stations cannot be expected to give much time or attention to the great vision for which Gene Debs gave his life. I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> observe that you have invited and obtained the acceptance {{of men and women}} as trustees who are not members of the Socialist Party.

2500|$|In fact, Popper wrote admiringly of {{the value}} of Darwin's theory. Only a few years later, Popper wrote, [...] "I have in the past {{described}} the theory as 'almost tautological' ... I still believe that natural selection works in this way as a research programme. Nevertheless, I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> have an opportunity to make a recantation." [...] His conclusion, later in the article is [...] "The theory of natural selection may be so formulated that it is far from tautological. In this case it is not only testable, but {{it turns out to be}} not strictly universally true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Along with SÃ¡dlo, VeÄtomov was {{considered}} one of Czechoslovakia's leading classical artists, drawing comparisons in the international press to Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who had been his contemporary at the Moscow Conservatory. VeÄtomov was best known for his inimitably sweet tone. âAs the concerto develops, it is clear that VeÄtomov, so august a member of the Czech Trio, was certainly a big enough concerto soloist, but one who does not seek to impose his personality onto the music. Instead he illuminates it from within.â Of the same recording, Fanfare observed: âI <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> have discovered SaÅ¡a VeÄtomovâs playing, for on this evidence he was a world-class artist â¦ his aristocratic playing deserves a hearing, and the disc should certainly be of interest to cellists and collectors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whitman {{appeared}} {{twice in}} New York City after the September 11 attacks to inform New Yorkers that the toxins {{released by the}} attacks posed no threat to their health. On September 18, the EPA released a report in which Whitman said, [...] "Given {{the scope of the}} tragedy from last week, I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> reassure the people of New York and Washington, D.C. that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink." [...] She also said, [...] "The concentrations are such that they don't pose a health hazard...We're going to make sure everybody is safe." [...] A 2003 report by the EPA's Inspector General determined that the assurance was misleading, because the EPA [...] "did not have sufficient data and analyses" [...] to justify it.|$|E

2500|$|Mahathir {{continued}} to attract controversy in retirement for remarks on international affairs. He is a strident critic of Israel, {{to the point}} where in 2012 he stated: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> be labeled antisemitic [...] How can I be otherwise, when the Jews who so often talk of the horrors they suffered during the Holocaust show the same Nazi cruelty and hard-heartedness towards not just their enemies but even towards their allies should any try to stop the senseless killing of their Palestinian enemies." [...] Mahathir established the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission to investigate the activities of the United States, Israel and its allies in Iraq, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. He has also suggested that the September 11 attacks of 2001 might have been staged by the United States government.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 24 February, Clarke and Ryder dined at the British Consulate, finally meeting with Vichaichan. The Governor put before him {{the terms of the}} offer. After much {{complaint}} the humiliated Vichaichan was forced to accept Chulalongkorn's terms in full. For he had come to realize that these were the most favourable terms he could hope to receive and that the hospitality of the British was finite. That evening Chulalongkorn wrote to Clarke: [...] "My good Friend, My private secretary has reported his conversation with Your Excellency. I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> agree that my cousin shall return to his palace quietly in the early morning, and come to me at eleven o'clock, when, as I must meet the wishes of my own people, I think it better that only Siamese should be present at our reconciliation, Your faithful friend, Chulalonkorn Rex" [...] After spending a day and a night as guests of the king at the Grand Palace, Clarke and his company returned to Singapore.|$|E
2500|$|Ament, {{writing to}} Rev. Dr. Judson Smith on 27 December 1900, {{before he became}} aware of any criticism, gives this account of the {{collection}} of indemnities: After a month of very hard work, I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> report progress to you. I visited - beginning on the south - Wen An, Pao Ting Hsien, Pa Chou, P'ing Ting, Cho Chou, Liang Hsiang, and on the east, Shun Yi. I found the officials in all these places exceedingly friendly and anxious to settle the affairs of the converts, recognizing the right and the need of such claims. I have made no use of foreign soldiers and brought no external pressure to bear, relying on the justice of our claims. Mr. Conger has supported us in the measures and methods taken, though the military people have not failed to make criticisms. The survivors in all our country stations have been recouped for all their losses, again reinstated in their villages, with some money in hand, and a promise of houses restored next spring. Over and above restoration for the converts there has been gathered a fund for the support of widows and orphans, who have no homes and have no one to look after them." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 1926, the University of Kansas {{announced}} that it had hired Cappon as its new football coach. [...] Former Michigan football coach George Little, then at Wisconsin, recommended Cappon to the administrators at Kansas. [...] Little said {{he had tried to}} take Cappon with him to Wisconsin and called Cappon [...] "one of the most promising coaches of recent graduation in the United States." [...] On his first visit to Lawrence, Kansas, Cappon told reporters: [...] "I always have heard of the clean, fine sportsmanship in the Missouri Valley conference, and I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> be coming out this way. ... I hope we may turn out a football team that will be a credit to the Valley and in every way uphold Valley traditions for clean play and sportsmanship." [...] In two seasons as the football coach at Kansas, Cappon's record was 5â10â1. [...] According to a 1940 history of football at the University of Kansas, Cappon resigned after two years at Kansas {{as the result of a}} controversy over [...] "scouting." [...] The Missouri Valley conference schools had agreed [...] "not to 'scout' each other in the belief that such a practice was unsportsmanlike." [...] After Kansas beat Missouri 14â7 with a new passing attack and [...] "impregnable defense," [...] Missouri produced evidence to show that Kansas supporters, not part of the Kansas staff, had acted as [...] "volunteer scouts" [...] at Missouri games and had provided Cappon with [...] "charts of the Tiger plays," [...] that enabled Cappon to develop new schemes to stop the Missouri offense. [...] According to the 1940 account, the [...] "upshot of the affair was Cappon's resignation." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 29 May 1942 it was {{announced}} that all Jews living in the occupied zone had to wear a yellow star of David with the words Juif or Juive written on it at all times by 7 June 1942. Ousby described the purpose of the yellow star [...] "not just to identify but [...] to humiliate, and it worked".On 14 June 1942, a 12-year-old Jewish boy committed suicide in Paris as his classmates were now shunning the boy with the yellow star. As a form of quiet protest, many Jewish veterans started to wear their medals alongside the yellow star, which led the Germans to ban all Jewish veterans from wearing their medals alongside the yellow stars of David due to being [...] "inappropriate", as it increased popular sympathy for men who fought and suffered for France. At times, ordinary people would show sympathy for Jews; as a Scot married to a Frenchman, Janet Teissier du Cros wrote in her diary about a Jewish woman wearing her yellow star of David going shopping: [...] "She came humbly up and stood hesitating {{on the edge of the}} pavement. Jews were not allowed to stand in queues. What they were supposed to do I never discovered. But the moment the people in the queue saw her they signed to her to join us. Secretly and rapidly, as in the game of hunt-the-slipper, she was passed up till she stood at the head of the queue. I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> say that not one voice was raised in protest, the policeman standing near turned his head away, and that she got her cabbage before any of us".By 1942, the Paris Kommandantur was receiving an average of 1,500 corbeaux (poison pen letters) a day. One corbeaux written by a Frenchwoman read:"Since you are taking care of the Jews, and if your campaign is not just a vain word, then have a look at the kind of life led by the girl M.A, formerly a dancer, now living at 41 Boulevard de Strasbourg, not wearing a star. This creature, for whom being Jewish is not enough, debauches the husbands of proper Frenchwomen, and you may well have an idea what she is living off. Defend women against Jewishness-that will be your best publicity, and you will return a French husband to his wife". In the summer of 1942, a committee consisting of SS HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer Theodor Dannecker, the Commissioner for Jewish Affairs Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, and general secretary of the police RenÃ© Bousquet had been planning a grand rafle (great round-up) of Jews to deport to the death camps. On the morning of 16 July 1942, the grand rafle was launched with 9,000 French policemen rounding up the Jews of Paris, leading to some 12,762 Jewish men, women and children being arrested and brought to the Val d'Hiv sports stadium, from where they were sent to the Drancy camp and finally Auschwitz. The grand rafle was a joint operation; the overwhelming majority of those who arrested the Jews were French policemen. During the grand rafle, some 100 Jews warned by friends in the police killed themselves, while 24 Jews were killed resisting arrest. One Jewish Frenchwoman, Madame Rado, who was arrested during the grand rafle with her four children, noted about the watching bystanders: [...] "Their expressions were empty, apparently indifferent". When taken with the other Jews to the Place Voltaire, one woman was heard to shout [...] "Well done! Well done!" [...] while the man standing to her warned her [...] "After them, it'll be us. Poor people!". Rado herself survived Auschwitz, but her four children were killed in the gas chambers.|$|E
