5|$|A review makes {{reference}} {{to a number of}} studies that show the involvement of the hippocampus in conflict tasks. The authors suggest that a challenge is to understand how conflict processing relates to the functions of spatial navigation <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> and how all of these functions need not be mutually exclusive.|$|E
25|$|The Prospective <b>and</b> Retrospective <b>Memory</b> Questionnaire (PRMQ) was {{developed}} by Smith et al. (2000) to measure self-reports of prospective <b>and</b> retrospective <b>memory</b> in patients with Alzheimer's disease. It is a questionnaire consisting of 16 items; in which participants rank how often memory failure occurs using a 5-point scale (Very Often, Quite Often, Sometimes, Rarely, and Never). The PRMQ equally assesses three variables: prospective <b>and</b> retrospective <b>memory,</b> short-term <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> long-term <b>memory,</b> <b>and</b> self-cued <b>and</b> environmentally-cued <b>memory.</b>|$|R

5|$|Hazareesingh (2004) explores how Napoleon's image <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> {{are best}} understood. They {{played a key}} role in {{collective}} political defiance of the Bourbon restoration monarchy in 1815–1830. People from different walks of life and areas of France, particularly Napoleonic veterans, drew on the Napoleonic legacy and its connections with the ideals of the 1789 revolution.|$|E

5|$|It is one {{of several}} {{phenomena}} underlying synaptic plasticity, the ability of chemical synapses to change their strength. As memories are thought to be encoded by modification of synaptic strength, LTP is widely considered one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlies learning <b>and</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
5|$|The sea slug Aplysia californica {{was chosen}} by Nobel Prize-winning {{neurophysiologist}} Eric Kandel {{as a model for}} studying the cellular basis of learning <b>and</b> <b>memory,</b> because of the simplicity and accessibility of its nervous system, and it has been examined in hundreds of experiments.|$|E

5|$|While the {{long-term}} potentiation of synapses in cell culture seems {{to provide an}} elegant substrate for learning <b>and</b> <b>memory,</b> the contribution of LTP to behavioral learning — that is, learning {{at the level of}} the whole organism — cannot simply be extrapolated from in vitro studies. For this reason, considerable effort has been dedicated to establishing whether LTP is a requirement for learning <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> in living animals. Because of this, LTP also plays a crucial role in fear processing.|$|E
5|$|A {{high-profile}} shooter, Walsh won numerous tournaments {{within the}} FBI and the Marine Corps, {{as well as}} nationally, and participated in the 1948 Summer Olympics. He received awards for his marksmanship {{until the age of}} 90 and served as the coach of the Olympic shooting team until 2000. At the FBI's 100th anniversary celebration he was recognized as the oldest living former agent and noted as being a year older than the organization itself. Aside from some hearing <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> loss, he remained physically fit at his 103rd birthday and, in March 2013, became the longest-lived Olympic competitor.|$|E

5|$|Father (1966) is {{a coming}} of age story that {{displays}} Szabó’s increasing fascination with history <b>and</b> <b>memory.</b> The main character copes with the childhood loss of his father {{against the backdrop of}} the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and memories of the Arrow Cross dictatorship. The film won the Grand Prix at the 5th Moscow International Film Festival and the Special Jury Prize at Locarno, and established Szabó as the most internationally famous Hungarian filmmaker of his time, as well as an auteur in the European film tradition. In 2000, Father appeared as number 11 on a list of the 12 best Hungarian films according to a group of Hungarian film critics.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{writes that}} Oprah Winfrey's {{promotion}} of Night {{came at a}} difficult time for the genre of memoir, after a previous book-club author, James Frey, {{was found to have}} fabricated parts of his autobiography, A Million Little Pieces (2003). She argues that Winfrey's choice of Night may have been intended to restore the book club's credibility. Night has a useful lesson to teach, Franklin writes, about the complexities of memoir <b>and</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment of learning <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> eventually {{leads to a}} definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} mouse embryo, cytoplasmic {{polyadenylation}} of maternal RNAs from the egg cell allows the cell {{to survive and}} grow even though transcription does not start {{until the middle of}} the 2-cell stage (4-cell stage in human). In the brain, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is active during learning and could play a role in long-term potentiation, which is the strengthening of the signal transmission from a nerve cell to another in response to nerve impulses and is important for learning <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> formation.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{blurring}} and thresholding, {{this method}} can alternatively {{be described as}} applying a median filter with Gaussian weights to each pixel. It is possible to use kernels other than the heat kernel, or to adaptively refine the grid so that it has high resolution near the curve but does not waste time <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> on pixels far from the curve that do {{not contribute to the}} outcome. Instead of using only the two values in the pixelated image, a version of this method that uses an image whose pixel values represent the signed distance to the curve can achieve subpixel accuracy and require lower resolution.|$|E
5|$|LTP was {{discovered}} in the rabbit hippocampus by Terje Lømo in 1966 and has remained a popular subject of research since. Many modern LTP studies seek to better understand its basic biology, while others aim to draw a causal link between LTP and behavioral learning. Still others try to develop methods, pharmacologic or otherwise, of enhancing LTP to improve learning <b>and</b> <b>memory.</b> LTP is also a subject of clinical research, for example, {{in the areas of}} Alzheimer's disease and addiction medicine.|$|E
