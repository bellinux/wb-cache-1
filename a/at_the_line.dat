5|$|BMC {{was active}} at {{two of the}} {{traditional}} season-opening races, attaining seventh place with Ballan in the Italian opener Trofeo Laigueglia, and eighth with Quinziato in the Belgian opener, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. Ballan narrowly missed victory a week later at Montepaschi Strade Bianche, finishing second <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> behind Philippe Gilbert. Ballan acknowledged that Gilbert and not he had used the optimal tactics in the final sprint, but felt nonetheless pleased with his early-season form. The two {{had been part of}} a 19-rider group that made all the selections through the sectors of unpaved roads before the finish on cobblestones in Siena.|$|E
5|$|Bekele was keen {{to regain}} his cross country title from Zersenay and the 2008 cross country season was a {{competitive}} one. At the Great Edinburgh International Cross Country race, Zersenay was pipped by the Ethiopian <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> finishing just one second behind. The following month, Zersenay beat Eliud Kipchoge to win the Cinque Mulini race in the buildup to the 2008 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. On {{the day of the}} Championship race in Edinburgh, Scotland, Zersenay took the lead early on and set a strong pace at the mid-race point. However, near the finish Bekele and Kenyan Leonard Komon surged ahead to leave Zersenay as the bronze medallist.|$|E

However, Gatlin did {{not match}} that form in the final while Bolt {{improved}} through the rounds. In a narrow victory, Bolt leaned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to beat Gatlin 9.79 to 9.80 seconds. Bolt joined Carl Lewis and Maurice Greene on a record three 100m world titles.|$|E
5|$|The fourth- and second-to-last {{riders to}} leave the starthouse, Levi Leipheimer and Denis Menchov, put up the best rides of the day, with Menchov between 30 seconds and a minute better than Leipheimer at the three {{intermediate}} time checks, and 20 seconds better <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> for the stage win. Menchov's ride propelled him into the pink jersey, while Leipheimer narrowly missed taking enough time out of Di Luca to move past him in the general classification. Di Luca finished sixth on the stage.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{returned}} to the Alabama 21-yard line. The first play of the half was a pass from Zow to Alexander, who gained eight yards. On second down, Alexander picked up the first down with a run to the 34-yard line. Zow completed a pass to Milons at the 38-yard line, then had a pass knocked down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of scrimmage by the Virginia Tech defense. Zow's third-down pass was knocked down, and the Tide punted. The kick {{was returned}} to the Tech 24-yard line, and the Hokies began their first drive of the second half.|$|E

5|$|Cancellara {{began to}} achieve success in June, during the Tour de Suisse. He won the opening time {{trial of the}} race and the time trial on stage nine en route to his overall victory. In {{addition}} to the general classification, he also won the secondary points classification of the Tour de Suisse. A week after finishing the Tour de Suisse, {{he won his first}} Swiss national road racing crown on 28 June after outsprinting Mathias Frank <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> He continued to win in July, as he won the opening stage of the Tour de France and took the first yellow jersey of the race. He then successfully defended the lead until the seventh stage, when he was unable to bridge the gap to the leaders on the Arcalis mountain-top finish.|$|E
5|$|Danilo Di Luca {{tried to}} {{attack from the}} pink jersey group a few times {{at the foot of}} the climb, but Menchov {{answered}} each time. When Ivan Basso and Carlos Sastre attacked, Menchov and Di Luca let them go, seeming fixed solely on one another. Sastre's attack proved to be the crucial one, as he seemed quite fresh for having been climbing for over seven hours, staying clear of the pink jersey and blowing past Popovych to claim the stage win. With the time gained on the road as well as bonus seconds <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> Sastre moved up to third in the overall classification. Menchov outsprinted Di Luca to the finish line, gaining one second on the road and four bonus seconds to slightly pad his lead over Di Luca. Thomas Lövkvist, who had been in the white jersey as best young rider, was dropped very early on in this stage and finished 24 minutes behind the stage winner. He wound up dropping all the way to fifth in the youth classification, with Quick Step rider Kevin Seeldraeyers, 15th overall, assuming the white jersey.|$|E
5|$|Texas' first {{possession}} {{of the second half}} began with a two-yard run to the right. After that, Brown completed a first-down pass to Adams at the Texas 28-yard line. Following an incomplete pass, Williams ran for a short gain and Texas was stopped short of the needed yardage on third down. After the punt, Tech's offense started at their 11-yard line. Thomas gained six yards on a rushing play, then Druckenmiller completed a two-yard pass to Edmonds. On third down, Texas' Brackens moved offsides and Tech was given a first down at their 24-yard line. Thomas then broke free on a running play for an 11-yard gain and a first down at the Tech 35-yard line. After the first down, Druckenmiller scrambled for no gain, then Edmonds gained six yards on a running play. On third down, a Druckenmiller pass was knocked down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of scrimmage by a Texas defender and the Hokies had to punt.|$|E

5|$|The {{synthesis}} of the heavy isotopes 294Lv and 295Lv could be accomplished by fusing the heavy curium isotope curium-250 with calcium-48. The cross section of this nuclear reaction would be about 1picobarn, {{though it is not}} yet possible to produce 250Cm in the quantities needed for target manufacture. After a few alpha decays, these livermorium isotopes would reach nuclides <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of beta stability. Additionally, electron capture may also become an important decay mode in this region, allowing affected nuclei to reach the middle of the island. For example, 295Lv would alpha decay to 291Fl, which would undergo successive electron capture to 291Nh and then 291Cn which is expected {{to be in the middle}} of the island of stability and have a half-life of about 1200years, affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology. A drawback is that the decay properties of superheavy nuclei this close to the line of beta stability are largely unexplored.|$|E
5|$|Waltrip {{took over}} the lead on lap 163, and an eighth caution was necessitated when Biffle made contact with Ragan, who hit Harvick, who spun heading into turn three but avoided hitting the {{barriers}} or other cars. Some drivers, including Waltrip, chose to pit for fresh tires and fuel during the caution. Montoya elected not to pit, and led the field at the restart on lap 169. The top six drivers quickly began {{to pull away from}} the rest of the field, as Stewart ran fourth and Harvick 16th by lap 172. Stewart and Montoya ran alongside each other <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> on lap 173, before Stewart moved in front for the lead one lap later. On the same lap, a second multi-car accident occurred necessitating a ninth caution when Edwards made contact with teammate Biffle going into turn three, and collected, Earnhardt, Harvick, Kyle Busch, Nemechek, Sorenson, Kenseth, Kvapil, Watrip, Dave Blaney and Montoya. The second red-flag of the race was shown shortly afterward to allow officials to clear debris from the track. The race was restarted twelve minutes later, as some drivers made pit stops.|$|E
