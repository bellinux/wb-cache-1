Several of those closest to the New Guinea coastline are low-lying, formed by alluvial sedimentary deposits borne by the outflow of the local rivers into the sea. Many of the western islands are hilly and steep, formed mainly of granite, and are peaks of the northernmost extension of the Great Dividing Range now turned into islands when sea levels rose {{at the end of the}} last ice age. The central islands are predominantly coral cays, and those of the east are of volcanic origins. The islands are considered Australian territory and are administered from Thursday Island. There are several major policy and institutional frameworks in the Torres Strait region that support the sustainable use and management of marine resources while also protecting habitats, biodiversity and the traditional islander way of life. Most important of these is the Torres Strait Treaty entered into by Australia and Papua New Guinea in February 1985. The Treaty defines sovereignty and maritime boundaries in the area between the two countries. It guides decision makers on protecting the way of life and livelihood of traditional inhabitants, on managing the protection of habitats, and on sharing the commercial and traditional fisheries resources. The Treaty established a Torres Strait Protected Zone within which both nations manage <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources.</b> Each country exercises sovereign jurisdiction for resources on either side of the agreed jurisdiction lines.|$|E

The nature of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources</b> means that intervention is required to provide for optimal economic performance and to meet environmental objectives. Management authorities therefore spend considerable funds to conduct stock research, make decisions and enforce those decisions. It is estimated that 36 per cent of all government financial transfers associated with fishery policies in OECD countries 2 are for research, management and enforcement services. At its April 2000 meeting the OECD Fisheries Committee adopted an outline for {{a study on the}} costs of these services. The study will explore the extent of these costs and analyze how they vary between countries, fisheries and management systems in use.

An analysis of several case studies in Australia identifies that the purported economic benefits from reallocating <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources</b> from commercial to recreational fishers are based on inappropriate approaches to economic valuation including the "revenues argument" and the "cumulative-value argument". The allocating of fisheries resources (on an economic basis) in an area between recreational and commercial fishers should not be based on simple but erroneous comparisons between recreational fishing expenditure and the gross value of production of commercial fishing. Rather, it {{should be based on}} comparing the benefit of an extra fish, or extra few fish, to each sector. If one sector is found to have a higher benefit, a small change in access should be made in its favour and, if necessary, a further series of small changes until the extra benefit gained by that sector is equal to the benefit gained (or lost) by the competing sector. However, any allocation decisions should not just focus on economic issues, but should also consider the ecological impacts and social costs and benefits attributable to both fishing sectors...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} twenty years, policy {{prescriptions}} for addressing the global crisis in fisheries have centred on strengthening fisheries governance through clarifying exclusive individual or community rights of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>fishery</b> <b>resources.</b> With a focus on small-scale developing-country fisheries in particular, we argue that basing the case for fishery governance reform on assumed economic incentives for resource stewardship is insufficient when there are other sources of insecurity in people's lives that are unrelated {{to the state of}} <b>fishery</b> <b>resources.</b> We argue that more secure, less vulnerable fishers make more effective and motivated fishery managers in the context of participatory or rights-based fisheries governance, and we further suggest that insecurity among fishers living in poverty can be most effectively addressed by social and political development that invokes the existing legal framework supporting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This perspective goes well beyond the widely advocated notion of 'rights-based fishing' and aligns what fishery sector analysts call the 'rights-based approach' with the same terminology used in the context of international development.

40|$|The {{principle}} behind community based {{fisheries management}} is handover of fisheries resources to community groups {{and they will}} manage the resources sustainably and equitably. The benefits of this approach are obvious [...] it is pro-poor, equitable and sustainable. Handing over fisheries management to community groups secures <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources</b> for those people whose lives depend on them i. e. the poor fishers. This ensures a pro-poor approach supportive of the national goal of poverty alleviation. In addition to this, by {{making sure that the}} best fisheries do not forever end up with the few local elites, community managed fisheries guarantees equitable distribution of benefits from fisheries resources. The lives of some millions of people are dependent on fisheries resources and they must be allowed to enjoy the benefits from these resources. Moreover, unlike the current revenue based system of fisheries management, community managed fisheries approach is not driven by the overarching desire for profit. As a result, community groups responsible for managing fisheries resources balance the need for production with conservation which results in sustainability. A brief comparison of the approaches adopted for fisheries management (presented in the following tabular form) clearly demonstrates the advantages of community managed fisheries approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{coastal zone}} {{is a place}} of intense {{activity}} where resources, users, and resource-use practices interact. This case study of small-scale fisheries in Honda Bay, Palawan, Philippines shows that resources, space, and gender are intertwined. The study was conducted between June 1997 and July 1998. The data were gathered using free listing, pile sort, ranking, resource mapping, and key informant interviews. The results showed that women's knowledge about <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> and their fishing activities are associated with the intertidal zone whereas men's knowledge is associated with coral reefs. In classifying <b>fishery</b> <b>resources,</b> appearance is the main consideration for women whereas a combination of appearance, habitat, and type of fishing gear is the consideration used by men. Market price is very important because of its dependence on the demand of the export market as well as the local market. Women dominate the buying of fishery products. Many women market their husband's catch, process fish, or gather shells and sea cucumber for sale. Among the fishing households, type of fishing gear provides an indication of socioeconomic standing. This paper concludes that <b>access</b> <b>to</b> resources is shaped by gender and age. The differences in resource knowledge possessed by men and women lead <b>to</b> differential <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>fishery</b> <b>resources.</b> In addition, the differences in socioeconomic status also influence resource access. The socialization of children into fishing reinforces the gender division of labor and space in the coastal zone.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses {{a social}} relational approach {{to investigate the}} conditions under which resource users from seven rural coastal communities cooperate <b>to</b> <b>access</b> fish resources within and outside the limits of the Loreto Bay National Marine Park, Baja California Sur, Mexico. I use social network analysis methods to quantify the extent to which socially diverse and geographically distant individuals share information on the state/location of fish <b>resources</b> and <b>fisheries</b> regulations. The main findings are as follows: 1) Information sharing is widespread within communities and, to a lesser extent, among communities, despite the over-exploited condition of fish resources. 2) Information sharing is embedded in kinship, friendship, and acquaintance relations, which ensure the social integration of <b>fishery</b> <b>resource</b> users across social categories (e. g., locality and occupation) and geographically distant localities. However, these categories reflected different degrees of social stratification. 3) Occupation, years of fishing experience, and years of residence account for the importance of resource users in the network of information sharing. However, these three variables do not always predict the most important resource users within each community. 4) The social networks of information sharing have manifest (<b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>fishery</b> <b>resources)</b> and latent (social integration) functions. These networks also have logically related functions: the internal function (F 1) is social and emotional support; the external function (F 2) or role is social integration; and the total function (F 3 = F 1 + F 2) is achieving group tasks (i. e., accessing <b>fishery</b> <b>resources).</b> From a local perspective (perceived by network members) social networks are valuable (F 4) but from a global perspective (perceived by management authorities) they may be regarded as dysfunctional (i. e., the cause of overfishing). I argue that the inherent social and emotional condition of individuals on which social networks of information sharing are based, is a powerful resource often neglected by the most influential theories and participatory policies for conservation and management of <b>fishery</b> <b>resources.</b> Thus, effectively tapping into these social networks for conservation and sustainable management of <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> in the Loreto Bay National Marine Park may require managers with long-term commitments to their conservation areas and socially and emotionally engaged managers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract onlyMany fisheriues in Vietnam have {{witnessed}} notable reductions in catch and fish size. Given {{the millions of}} Vietnamese who are dependent on marine resources, {{it is critical to}} not only develop more sustainable fisheries management practices, but also understand the links between vulnerability and other socio-economic and institutional factors, in order to remove obstacles and promote opportunities for sustainability and poverty alleviation. Poverty {{is the result of a}} combination of circumstances that limit livelihood opportunities. Poverty alleviation efforts must therefore recognize other circumstances which may contribute to the vulnerability of the poor, such as lack of access to - and control over - resources, and food insecurity. Because vulnerability in the fisheries sector is due to this combination of circumstances, sustainable use of marine resources will not be sufficient to alleviate poverty. Redistribution of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources,</b> or to the benefits derived from fisheries, will be essential to alleviating poverty. The Fisheries Socio-economic Review project examined the obstacles and opportunities facing development of sustainable fisheries regimes that would support poverty alleviation in Vietnam.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the recognition, development and reinforcement of tenure systems in small-scale fisheries, {{and the conditions}} for those tenure systems to be effective and fair.

This study assesses whether the Taiapure provisions do in fact fulfil this objective, in policy terms and in terms of a te iwi Maori perspective. By applying an analytical framework, which exposes the underlying structural logic of the provisions and its inability to link with the surrounding context, and by taking a case study approach, which reflects te iwi Maori perspectives, the Taiapure provisions are shown to fall short of fulfilling their objective. Recommendations for rectifying this shortfall are then offered, and a practical option for the future is suggested as an 'ideal' for which to aim...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{review the}} {{ecological}} and socio-economic {{impacts of the}} catastrophic dam failure in Mariana, Brazil. Tailing management practices by Samarco mining company ultimately caused a dam breach that abruptly discharged between 55 and 62 millionm 3 of tailings into the Doce River watershed. On November 5 th, 2015, a tsunami of slurry engulfed the small district of Bento Rodrigues, loading the Doce River and its estuary with toxic tailings along a 663. 2 km trajectory, extending impacts to the Atlantic coast. Acute ecological impacts will adversely affect livelihoods of more than 1 million people in 41 riparian municipalities by reducing local <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources,</b> clean water, crop production sites, hydroelectric power generation and raw materials. The threats to riverine human communities are particularly critical for the disadvantaged populations from remote areas that rely on subsistence agriculture and fisheries, and are uniquely vulnerable to long-term heavy metal exposure. At the landscape scale, we predict multiple negative impacts, ranging from alterations of the genetic diversity of fish populations to long-term vegetation loss and poor regeneration in contaminated areas. Consequently, compromised soil stability and runoff control will {{increase the risk of}} further geomorphologic disturbance, including landslides, bank failure and mass movements. We propose spatially explicit long-term monitoring frameworks and priority mitigation measures to cope with acute and chronic risks. We posit that, from a national perspective, disastrous impacts like that of Doce River may become more frequent, given the recent regulatory changes that undermine both institutional governance structures and enforcement of environmental regulation...|$|E
40|$|Conflict between {{recreational}} and commercial fishers resulting from competition for shared fish stocks {{is a significant}} concern {{in the management of}} fisheries resources throughout Australia, with each sector calling for tighter restrictions on the activities of the other. In north Queensland, competition for a share of the barramundi resource is apparent through numerous media articles outlining opinions of both sectors. Opinions expressed in the media can influence decisions by managers and politicians who allocate and distribute <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources,</b> though usually it is not known whether such opinions are representative of the general fishing population. To address this uncertainty, a questionnaire program was implemented for recreational line fishers and commercial gillnet fishers. Questions focussed on fishers’ perceptions about competition and conflict between the sectors, their view and knowledge of their own and the competing sectors’ impacts, and their suggested solutions to competition. Results indicate that fishers from each sector holds negative opinions of the competing sector, and positive opinions of their own sector, perhaps indicating a likelihood for blame for negative outcomes, such as declines in catches. Negative opinions, however, appear to be based on perceptions that are not supported by scientific research, suggesting that correct information about fishing impacts of each sector is failing to reach the general fishing public. Solutions suggested by respondents include improving education and communication within and between sectors, or segregating the sectors via Recreational Only Fishing Areas (ROFAs). Overall, results suggest that current conflict between sectors may be eased through increased education and communication, highlighting the importance of social research into such situations...|$|E

In the interests of creating a principle-centred approach to fisheries management in EU waters and for the EU fleet globally, OCEAN 2012 is investigating issues that may be incorporated into a reformed CFP. Some of these issues capture ideas relating to enshrining environmental objectives within in the CFP as a prerequisite to fulfilling social and economic objectives; defining a decisionmaking framework that ensures strategic and operational decisions are made at appropriate levels; defining instruments and competencies that deliver sustainable fishing capacity at EU and regional level, including legally-binding, time-bound capacity limits per fisher, both in quantitative and qualitative terms; basing access rules on criteria that ensure a transition to, and support for, environmentally and socially sustainable fishing; and creating transparent and participatory decisionmaking processes.

However, many scholars have {{stressed the importance}} of other dimensions of identity, such as gender, caste and class, in studying social tension. This study uses intersectionality theory to examine how a combination of the social categories of gender, race, ethnicity and location creates structural inequality. This article draws upon in-depth research on Muslim, Tamil, Sinhalese and indigenous/Veder women who catch and market fish in the conflict-affected eastern district of Trincomalee, Sri Lanka. The focus was on intra-group differences among these women and the different sources of power they use to subvert existing power structures.

40|$|Foreword Fishing {{is a vital}} {{source of}} food, jobs and income that {{contributes}} to food security and poverty reduction in many African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) coastal states. But most of these countries, especially Senegal, Mauritania and Namibia, rely heavily on {{a small number of}} exported species. Even so, the fisheries sector provides ACP countries with real longer-term economic opportunities because the EU imports 60 % of the fish consumed in its home market. The heavy toll taken of stocks and ecosystems by over-exploitation of <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> is undermining all sustainable development efforts in regions like West Africa. This makes proper resource management and effective control systems vital to avoid over-fishing and the collapse of fish stocks, so that ACP countries can benefit significantly from this sector of the economy. Fisheries relations between the ACP States and the EU are governed by a range of instruments, especially ACP national fisheries policies, the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy, development cooperation instruments and the bilateral fisheries agreements entered into by the EU with individual ACP States. Bilateral agreements give European fishing fleets greater <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> in exchange for the payment of financial compensation, which is a major source of income for ACP States. These agreements introduce a series of problems in the picture with regard to: (i) sustainable exploitation of marine resources and environmental protection, (ii) protection for artisanal fishing communities, maximizing the benefits of fishing through value-enhancement, and (iv) monitoring systems. These issues of ACP-EU fisheries relations are also addressed in Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) negotiated by ACP countries with the EU. The revision of the Common <b>Fisheries</b> Policy (CFP) <b>to</b> achieve more sustainable fishing and greater protection of the marine environment should deliver a net gain to ACP fishers. Against this background, CTA works with the ACP Secretariat, European Commission and Commonwealth Secretariat to give ongoing support to ACP countries, not least by providing a forum for ACP and EU experts to exchange information. Over 350 experts and policymakers from ACP and EU Ministries of Trade and Fisheries, along with representatives of the Brussels-based ACP Group, the European Commission, the private sector, NGOs, fisheries associations, international organisations, EU development cooperation agencies and research bodies took part in two technical seminars held in Brussels in April 2003 and December 2004, followed up by an electronic consultation to further explore the two big issues of market access and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU). This publication reviews the main approaches of these players to issues {{at the top of the}} ACP-EU fisheries relations agenda. Improving <b>access</b> <b>to</b> information The recommendations highlight the key role of information and communication technologies (ICT). CTA provides services and products that improve <b>access</b> <b>to</b> information for agricultural and rural development in ACP countries. For example, CTA works together with key partners in the <b>fisheries</b> sector <b>to</b> facilitate in situ or electronic discussion fora, as well as capacity-building and training programmes, and funding participation by ACP experts to present the ACP case in international meetings. CTA also provides information portals (websites) on the fisheries sector - “Agritrade”, “Knowledge for Development”, as well as “ICT Update”, a newsletter specifically on ICT applications in the fisheries sector. For those without Internet <b>access,</b> CTA continues <b>to</b> support a range of other media like rural radio, mobile phones, the print media like the magazine Spore/Esporo, and a wide range of publications, many focused on the fisheries sector. It has also very recently launched a new series of easily-reproducible “how-to” guides providing technical information in easy-to-understand terms, offering yet another opportunity to engage with fishing and fishers. Growing demand from our ACP partners and the importance of the fisheries sector prompts me to reaffirm the commitment of CTA and its partners to further developing these services, providing platforms through which to leverage empirical knowledge, and facilitating the exchange of expertise and experiences. I should also like to take this opportunity to thank all our partners and the ACP and EU authors who so kindly undertook to formulate and finalize the presentation of this wealth of experiences. I hope you will find it instructive reading.

40|$|Fishery {{cooperation}} {{agreements with the}} Sub-Saharan West African coastal states are considered by the European Union as purely commercial deals that are designed <b>to</b> maximize <b>access</b> <b>to</b> coastal state <b>fishery</b> <b>resources,</b> secure employment for European harvesting and processing industries and supply European seafood consumption markets at the lowest possible cost. Financial compensation paid by Brussels to the West African countries for fishing rights covers two-thirds {{or more of the}} license fees and is a subsidy for European vessel owners. This subsidy puts EU in position of a preferred user of the coastal resources. That displaces foreign investors and local entrepreneurs in the coastal states, distorts economics of the European fishing enterprises and promotes excessive pressure on the resources that greatly harms the marine environment in the West African region. Analysis of EU’s relations with Guinea-Bissau shows that together with manipulation of the size of fishing fleet used by EU in this country’s waters, there were significant irregularities resulting from excessive by-catch, underpayment of tuna license fees and denial of timely statistical information for the coastal state. Continuation of this type of relations with Sub-Saharan West Africa is against the long-term interests of the coastal states and sustainability of the coastal resources. Unless significant changes in fishing policies of the EU are made, West African coastal countries will face severe overexploitation of their resources and subsequent drop in license revenues. The EU’s departure from purely business approach in fisheries relations with the West African coastal countries and termination of subsidization of th...|$|R
40|$|Artisanal {{fisheries}} {{are increasingly}} been accepted as the panacea for exploiting marine resources in costal Ghana. However evidence mustered {{over the years}} indicate that the local fisher-folk who are engaged in small scale fisheries hardly get full participation in making decision governing these resources. The current study examine the factors that constrain fishers participation in decision making and how this impact on their livelihood adaptation strategies. With {{the combination of the}} Livelihood Approach and the Intuitional analysis framework, data was collected by interviewing key informants from Chorkor and Nungua fishing communities of Greater Accra, Ghana. Document analysis and observation were also employed in the data collection process. Data was analysed using Miles and Huberman (1994) approaches to data analysis. Findings indicate that, the effective participation of rural fisher-folk in making decisions on access to fishing grounds and other livelihood adaptation strategies is a complex task due to the institutional gap between the formal government and the traditional chiefs of the fishing communities. Further analysis affirmed that the type of decision making chain (top-down approach) pertaining to access, does not promote the effective participation of local fishers since policies are passed down from the top government officials. It was also clear that the fisher-folk are not represented in the Fisheries commission due to that, they are not abreast with the kind of policies that the commission institute regarding access. Pertaining to the vulnerability context, results indicate that although the fisher-folk are vulnerable, a significant number of them had devised several coping strategies out of their current situation of declining catches. Institutions {{play a major role in}} fisheries governance however, findings show that the main legislative instrument, Fisheries Act 2002 (Act 625), governing the fisheries sector and the sector ministry have no provision on <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>ﬁsheries</b> <b>resources.</b> Out of the discussions of the findings, the study recommends for the development of institutional structures that make it possible to effectively integrate the local fisher-folk in the fisheries commission where major decision and policies are made. Furthermore, using existing viable community customs and traditions to manage local resources have a higher propensity of success because they already have the legitimacy, support and commitment of those they represent. Finally, government should to commit itself to effectively decentralizing the act of decision-making process so as to adequately empower local fisher-folk in implementing their own management objectives. This could immensely improve their livelihood adaptation strategies...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to help {{fisheries}} officials better understand the cultures of small - scale fishing communities. By doing so they will be better prepared to develop more successful management policies and practices, and {{to help people in}} such communities to have more decent lives. The paper discusses cultural characteristics of small-scale fishing communities that are particularly important for fisheries officials to understand. Methods which might help fisheries managers to obtain trustworthy and reliable information about fishing cultures in an ethical manner are also suggested, including methods for rapidly acquiring important information while working within tight budgetary and time constraints. Recommendations appearing {{near the end of the}} paper provide guidance concerning how the foregoing objectives can be achieved, underscoring the importance of sustaining small –scale fishers' rights of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources</b> while making their cultures integral considerations in fisheries- management policies and practices. Buen Hombre is one of six case studies of contemporary small -scale fishing communities from distinct world -culture regions are annexed at the end, richly exemplifying many of the issues discussed in this report The essay written by Richard Stoffle is about the people of Buen Hombre, a small coastal fishing and farming village of about a thousand people located on the north coast of the Dominican Republic near the Haitian border. It is found on pages 219 – 245. The people of this village deal with the normal and abnormal problems of change. These changes are sometimes global and sometimes local. Changes occur in their climate, economy, and their environment. The people of this village prepare for and accommodate to these changes by (1) promoting a conservation ethic and (2) limiting access to their marine resources. When they are successful, fish -based food security issues are ameliorated. This essay discusses food security issues as these were faced by the people of the village of Buen Hombre from 1985 to 1995. While this is a very small segment of time, many changes did occur and these illustrate key temporal and spatial processes. Short-term changes in the economy and climate are common for coastal peoples who must constantly adjust their adaptive strategies to survive.

40|$|The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) granted {{significant}} <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources</b> to coastal States {{in their}} exclusive economic zones (EEZ), including tuna. As tuna {{is a highly}} migratory species, international law requires that States cooperate for the effective management of tuna stocks. The Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UN Fish Stocks Agreement) provides the framework by which such cooperation is to be achieved. The coastal and Island States of the Indian Ocean including Kenya, achieve the cooperative management of tuna through the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC). As a beneficiary of the EEZ regime, Kenya has declared sovereign rights over the fisheries resources in its EEZ. In recent years, {{because of the potential}} of the tuna resources in its EEZ, Kenya has expressed its aspirations to develop these resources. Kenya’s sovereign rights over the tuna resources in its EEZ are subject to relevant rules of international law. The LOSC confers upon Kenya management and conservation responsibilities as well as the residual duty to promote the optimum utilisation of its tuna resources. The significance of Kenya’s regulatory regime for conserving and managing tuna resources in its EEZ is exemplified by the LOSC and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement. This thesis analyses Kenya’s legal and policy framework relative to the management and conservation of the tuna resources in Kenya’s jurisdiction, to ascertain the consistency of this framework with the international and regional legal requirements. This will require an examination of the relevant international and regional legal requirements relative to the utilization of tuna and an analysis {{of the extent to which}} Kenya has met its international and regional commitments. Ultimately, this thesis argues that Kenya has not fully adopted measures consistent with its international and regional obligations for the sustainable utilization of tuna, and that Kenya’s current legal and policy framework does not adequately address the long-term sustainability of its tuna resources. This thesis will aid in the construction of recommendations for the review and reform of Kenya’s legal and policy framework. These recommendations will include the formulation of a tuna management plan calculated to enhance the management of, and benefits derived from Kenya’s tuna fisheries. This thesis explores various options for the optimum utilisation of Kenya’s tuna resources, with a view to fostering the sustainable development of Kenya’s tuna fisheries. In developing an appropriate framework for the sustainable development of its tuna resources, Kenya will necessarily require provisions and commitments that ensure the effective management and conservation of the tuna resources in its EEZ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the economic rationale for limited entry as a method of fishery management and discusses general advantages and disadvantages of license limitation and catch rights as the two primary methods of restricting <b>access</b> <b>to</b> marine <b>fisheries.</b> Traditional open-access methods of regulation (e. g., gear restrictions, size limits, trip limits, quotas, and closures) can be temporarily effective in protecting fish populations, but they generally fail to provide lasting biological or economic benefits to fishermen because they do not restrict <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>fishery.</b> The general result of regulation with unrestricted <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a <b>fishery</b> is additional and more costly and complex regulations as competition increases for dwindling <b>fishery</b> <b>resources.</b> Regulation that restricts <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a <b>fishery</b> in conjunction with selected traditional methods of regulation would encourage efficient resource usage and minimize the need for future regulatory adjustments, provided that enforcement and monitoring costs are not too great.

40|$|In Cambodia, {{agriculture}} {{and natural resources}} constitute a corner stone in the production systems of peasant families, who constitute {{the large majority of}} the rural population. Hence, in the perspective of an important demographic growth and an increasing marketing of agricultural inputs and outputs, man-made management of ecosystems represent considerable economic, social and environmental challenges to Cambodian peasants. The study precisely focuses on the peasant’s ways to manage rural territories. It rests on a fundamental hypothesis, according to which peasant practices are environmentally sustainable, economically efficient (in terms of creation of added-values) and socially equitable in the distribution of these added-values. A multi-scale analytical framework that integrates different dimensions of natural resources management is established to check out and fine tune this fundamental hypothesis. A first analytical framework, given a priori, covers the entire province of Kampong Thom. The second analytical framework is determined by choice. It covers two communes, {{selected on the basis of}} agro-ecological and institutional criteria, which are representative of rural dynamics observed and detailed at the provincial level. The first part shows the intricate links between agro-ecological diversity and peasant’s production systems. It details the social relationships that liven up rural territories and shows how power relationships structure or affect peasant communities. The next part analyses the new choices for collective and individual action for the management of natural resources. It points out the very conflictive nature of previous forms of management and the internal contradictions of the new choices. The potential contribution of commune council in natural resources management is also examined from a legal and organisational point of view. Field works carried out at the level of two communes detail and complete this analysis. First of all, spatial analysis of land use change between 1992 and 2006 shows the growing importance of non-peasant stakeholders in rural development dynamics. The analysis shows that when the development of rural territories can be entirely controlled by peasant’s communities, the dynamics of change are rational and efficient. Peasant’s strategies are characterized by a large diversity of activities, that all have in common the cultivation of rain-fed rice. The <b>access</b> <b>to</b> forest or <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources</b> on public state land is triggered by household’s activities diversification tactics in the dry season. These modes of access and use of natural resources are critically detailed and put in the perspective of the establishment of community fisheries and community forestry schemes. Management of private agricultural land is characterized by the overwhelming importance of rice in the cropping systems. Technical itineraries for rice cultivation implemented by rural households are analyzed and their economic results are evaluated. Different economic rationalities are highlighted in relation to inputs productivity. Elements of productivity, efficiency and profitability are also apprehended in relation with the <b>access</b> <b>to</b> credit and land markets. This analysis allows revisiting the assumed self-regulating role of land markets to ensure the growth of the agricultural sector on the one hand, and the improvement in the access of land for more equity on the other hand. Eventually, the analysis done at the commune level are put into the perspective of new institutional choices for collective and individual action for natural resources management and propose, in fine, operational recommendations to support peasant’s ways to manage natural resources...|$|R
