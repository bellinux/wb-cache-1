40|$|The {{importance}} of neutral dynamics is contentiously debated in the ecological literature. This debate focuses on neutral theory's assumption of fitness equivalency among individuals, which conflicts with stabilizing fitness that promotes coexistence through niche differentiation. I {{take advantage of}} competition–colonization trade-offs between species of <b>aquatic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> (protozoans and rotifers) to show that equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms can operate simultaneously. Competition trials between species with similar colonization abilities {{were less likely to}} result in competitive exclusion than for species further apart. While the stabilizing mechanism (colonization differences) facilitates coexistence at large spatial scales, species with similar colonization abilities also exhibited local coexistence probably due to fitness similarities allowing weak stabilizing mechanisms to operate. These results suggest that neutral- and niche-based mechanisms of coexistence can simultaneously operate at differing temporal and spatial scales, and such a spatially explicit view of coexistence may be one way to reconcile niche and neutral dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Aquatic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> play a {{major role}} in ocean ecology, the global carbon cycle and {{bioreactor}} engineering. The complex foodweb of an oceanic ecosystem may be modelled in terms of a few species of different types whose population densities obey coupled differential equations. However the functions and constants that appear in those equations depend in a complex way on the details of the dynamics of individual organisms and how they interact in larger scale phenomena. This talk will survey some of the following topics: (1) the fluid dynamics of micro-organism swimming, (2) the effect on nutrient uptake of an organism’s swimming motions, (3) chemotaxis in bacteria, (4) capture rate of phytoplankton by zooplankton when they all swim in a turbulent environment, (5) pattern-formation (e. g. bioconvection) in suspensions of upswimming micro-organisms (algae and bacteria), (6) the hydrodynamic interactions between swimming model micro-organisms and (7) their effect on the rheology and transport properties of the suspension as a whole.

40|$|Gas {{chromatography}} (GC) has {{in recent}} times become an important tool for the fatty acid profiling of human blood and plasma. An at-line procedure used in the fatty acid profiling of whole/intact <b>aquatic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> without any sample preparation was adapted for this work. A direct thermal desorption (DTD) interface was used to profile the fatty acid composition of human plasma and whole human blood of eight volunteers in a procedure omitting the usual lipid extraction steps that precede sample methylation in the traditional (off-line) protocols. Trimethylsulfonium hydroxide (TMSH) was used as reagent for thermally assisted methylation. In a fully automated manner, the liner of the GC injector {{is used as a}} sample-and-reaction container with the aid of the DTD interface. The fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles obtained using this novel approach, were very identical to those obtained when the traditional off-line protocol was applied. FAME yields obtained in the at-line DTD method were found to be very similar for saturated fatty acids, but significantly higher for polyunsaturated fatty acids compared to off-line yields. As a result of the contribution of circulating cell membranes in blood, substantial differences were observed when the amount of FAMEs obtained in whole human blood and human plasma samples were compared after their analysis. Thanks to the fully automated operation of this novel procedure, large series of analyses can easily be performed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A {{direct thermal}} {{desorption}} (DTD) interface was applied to profile the fatty acid composition of whole/intact <b>aquatic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> using trimethylsulfonium hydroxide (TMSH) as derivatization reagent in a fully automated fashion without any sample treatment. DTD was used to release cellular free and esterified fatty acids, after conversion into their methyl esters, from the very limited amounts of cells available in plankton community analysis using fluorescence-activated cell sorting of mixed (natural) microbial/algal populations. The liner of the GC injector {{is used as a}} sample-and-reaction container with the aid of the DTD interface. The fatty acids are converted into their methyl esters after an incubation (hydrolysis) time of 30 min with TMSH. After transportation into the injector, the liner is heated to effect thermally assisted methylation. Simultaneously, the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) are introduced from the liner into the capillary GC column. On the basis of peak intensities, the fatty acid compositions, thus obtained, were shown to be closely similar to those of a conventional lipid extraction and methylation procedure. The method was applied to some common freshwater algae, the green algae Scenedesmus acutus, the diatom Asterionella formosa and the filamentous cyanobacterium, Limnothrix sp. strain MRI. Using this novel method, poly-unsaturated fatty acids were methylated into their corresponding methyl esters without isomerization/pyrolytic side-reactions. The present method has been used to perform large series of analyses of algal and microbial cells. Up to 18 samples could be analysed per day. In order to reach this sample throughput, preparation of the (n + 1) th sample was performed simultaneously with GC analysis of the nth sample. © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

At its Eleventh Regular Session, the Commission agreed on the importance of considering access and benefit-sharing in relation to all components of biodiversity for food and agriculture, and decided that work in this field should be an early task within its Multi-Year Programme of Work (MYPOW). Accordingly, the Commission decided to consider arrangements and policies for access and benefit- sharing for genetic resources for food and agriculture at its Twelfth Regular Session (19 - 23 October 2009). To facilitate discussions and debate on access and benefit-sharing for genetic resources for food and agriculture at the Twelfth Regular Session, the Secretariat of the Commission has commissioned several background study papers on use and exchange patterns of genetic resources in the different sectors of food and agriculture. The studies provide an overview of past, current and possible future use and exchange patterns, as well as a description of terms and modalities for use and exchange of animal, <b>aquatic,</b> forest, <b>micro-organism</b> genetic resources; and of biological control agents.

40|$|Of {{the organic}} matter in soils {{typically}} < 1 % by weight is dissolved {{in the soil}} solution (dissolved organic matter; DOM). DOM is a continuum of molecules of various sizes and chemical structures which has largely been operationally defined as the fraction of total organic carbon in an aqueous solution that passes through a 0. 45 µm filter. Although only representing a relatively small proportion, it represents the most mobile part of soil organic carbon and is probably enriched with highly labile compounds. DOM acts {{as a source of}} nutrients for both soil and <b>aquatic</b> <b>micro-organisms,</b> influences the fate and transport of organic and inorganic contaminants, presents a potential water treatment problem and may indicate the mobilisation rate of key terrestrial carbon stores. The objective of this research was to ascertain some of the biologically relevant characteristics of soil DOM and specifically to determine: (1) the influence of method and time of extraction of DOM from the soil on its biochemical composition and concentration; (2) the dynamics of DOM biodegradation; and, (3) the effects of repeated applications of trace amounts of DOM on the rate of soil carbon mineralization. To examine the influence of method and time of extraction on the composition and concentration of DOM, soil solution was collected from a raised peat bog in Central Scotland using water extraction, field suction lysimetry, and centrifugation techniques on a bimonthly basis over the period of a year (Aug 2003 – Jun 2004). Samples were analysed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), protein, carbohydrate and amino acid content. For all of the sampled months except June the biochemical composition of DOC varied with extraction method, suggesting the biological, chemical and/or physical influences on DOC production and loss are different within the differently sized soil pores. Water-extractable DOC generally contained the greatest proportion of carbohydrate, protein and/or amino acid of the three extraction methods. Time of extraction had a significant effect on the composition of water- and suction-extracted DOC: the total % carbohydrate + protein + amino acid C was significantly higher in Oct than Dec, Feb and Jun for water-extracted DOC and significantly greater in Dec than Aug, Apr and Jun for suction-extracted DOC. There was no significant change in the total % carbohydrate + protein + amino acid C of centrifuge-extracted DOC during the sampled year. Time of extraction also had a significant effect on the % protein + amino acid N in water- and centrifuge-extracted DON: Oct levels were significantly higher than Feb for water-extracted DON and significantly higher in Aug and Apr for centrifuge-extracted DON. Concentrations of total DOC and total DON were also found to be dependent on time of extraction. DOC concentrations showed a similar pattern of variation over the year for all methods of extraction, with concentrations relatively constant for most of the year, rising in April to reach a peak in Jun. DON concentrations in water- and centrifuge-extracted DON peaked later, in Aug. There were no significant seasonal changes in the concentration of suction-extracted DON. A lack of correlation between DOC and DON concentrations suggested that DOC and DON production and/or loss are under different controls. Laboratory-based incubation experiments were carried out to examine the dynamics of DOC biodegradation. Over a 70 day incubation period at 20 oC, the DOM from two types of peat (raised and blanket) and four samples of a mineral soil (calcaric gleysol), each previously exposed to a different management strategy, were found to be comprised of a rapidly degradable pools (half-life: 3 – 8 days) and a more stable pool (half-life: 0. 4 to 6 years). For all soil types/treatments, excepting raised peat, the total net loss of DOC from the culture medium was greater than could be accounted for by the process of mineralization alone. A comparison between net loss of DOC and loss of DOC to CO 2 and microbial biomass determined by direct microscopy suggested {{that at least some of}} the differences between DOC mineralised and net DOC loss were due to microbial assimilation and release. Changes in the microbial biomass during the decomposition process showed proliferation followed by decline over 15 days. The protein and carbohydrate fractions showed a complex pattern of both degradation and production throughout the incubation. The effects of repeated applications of trace amounts of litter-derived DOC on the rate of carbon mineralization over a 35 day period were investigated in a laboratory based incubation experiment. The addition of trace amounts of litter-derived DOC every 7 and 10. 5 days appeared to ‘trigger’ microbial activity causing an increase in CO 2 mineralisation such that extra C mineralised exceeded DOC additions by more than 2 fold. Acceleration in the rate of extra C mineralised 7 days after the second addition suggested that either the microbial production of enzymes responsible for biodegradation and/or an increase in microbial biomass, are only initiated once a critical concentration of a specific substrate or substrates has been achieved. The addition of ‘DOC + nutrients’ every 3. 5 days had no effect on the total rate of mineralization. To date DOC has tended to be operationally defined according to its chemical and physical properties. An understanding of the composition, production and loss of DOC from a biological perspective is essential if we are to be able to predict the effects of environmental change on the rate of mineralization of soil organic matter. This research has shown that the pools of DOC extracted, using three different methods commonly used in current research, are biochemically distinct and respond differently to the seasons. This suggests some degree of compartmentalisation of biological processes within the soil matrix. The observed similarities between the characteristics of the decomposition dynamics of both peatland and agricultural DOC suggests that either there is little difference in substrate quality between the two systems or that the microbial community have adapted in each case to maximise their utilisation of the available substrate. The dependency of the concentration and biochemical composition of DOC on the seasons requires further work to ascertain which biotic and/or abiotic factors are exerting control. Published research has focussed on factors such as temperature, wet/dry cycles, and freeze/thawing. The effect of the frequency of doses of trace amounts of DOC on increasing the rate of soil organic C mineralization, evident from this research, suggests that the interval between periods of rainfall may be relevant. It also emphasises how it can be useful to use knowledge of a biological process as the starting point in determining which factors may be exerting control on DOC production and loss.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the second {{version of the}} PC-program 'European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances', EUSES 2. 0. It completely replaces the EUSES 1. 0 program and documentation. EUSES 2. 0 {{is designed to be}} a decision-support system for the evaluation of the risks of substances to man and the environment. The system is fully based on the EU Technical Guidance Documents for the risk assessment of new and existing substances and biocides. The documentation and program can be obtained from the European Chemicals Bureau, Ispra, Italy. EUSES {{is the result of a}} co-ordinated effort of EU Member States, the European Commission and the Europe-an Chemical Industry. This risk assessment is transparent and easy to perform: EUSES is well documented and available as a user-friendly computer program. Risks to man pertain to consumers, workers and man exposed through the environment. Protection goals in the environment include sewage treatment plant populations of <b>micro-organisms,</b> <b>aquatic,</b> terrestrial and sediment ecosystems and populations of predators. This assessment includes the marine environment. The risk assessment is carried out in a stepwise procedure starting with data input and estimation and further involving the estimation of emissions, the prediction of environmental distribution, the calculation of human and environmental exposure, the derivation of no-effect levels and the risk characterisation. Virtually all default settings can be changed and all estimated parameter values and intermediate results can be overwritten by measured data. The exposure assessment in EUSES covers the whole life cycle of substances as well as their fate in all environmental compartments at three spatial scales: the personal scale for consumers and workers, the local scale for man and ecosystems near point sources and the regional scale for man and ecosystems exposed as a result of all releases in a larger region. Where appropriate, in the effects module no-effect levels are derived for all ecosystems and populations considered. The human effects assessment covers all relevant endpoints for both threshold and non-threshold substances. The end-point of EUSES is a quantitative comparison per substance of the results of the effects and the exposure assessment. The resulting risk characterisation ratios (RCRs) can be regarded as indicators for the likelihood of adverse effects occurring...|$|R
