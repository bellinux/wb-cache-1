5|$|A small {{gasworks}} a {{short distance}} {{to the south of}} Westcott station opened in 1889 to provide power to Waddesdon Manor <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> buildings on the Rothschild's estate. A short spur line was built from Westcott station to the gasworks, running immediately parallel to the road south from Westcott village. In 1926 the gasworks closed and was replaced by an electrical generator elsewhere on the Waddesdon Manor grounds, and the track of the spur was removed.|$|E
5|$|Although the Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} find the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers (positive integers), it may be generalized to the real numbers, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> mathematical objects, such as polynomials, quadratic integers and Hurwitz quaternions. In the latter cases, the Euclidean {{algorithm is}} used to demonstrate the crucial property of unique factorization, i.e., that such numbers can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements, the counterparts of prime numbers. Unique factorization is essential to many proofs of number theory.|$|E

Canada also maintains historic ties to the United Kingdom and France <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> former British and French colonies through Canada's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Francophonie. Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Cathay dragon (Formerly Dragonair) {{operated}} {{its first}} commercial flight from Hong Kong to Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia in July 1985 with a Boeing 737-200 aircraft, after receiving its air operator's certificate. In 1986, the airline introduced regular passenger services to Guilin, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Xiamen in the People's Republic of China, and to Phuket, Thailand. In the following years, the airline's operations expanded to more {{cities in the}} People's Republic of China <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> countries across Asia, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Japan, Nepal, Philippines, the Republic of China (Taiwan), South Korea and Vietnam. Initially, Dragonair operated its passenger services only as regular charter flights; these were passenger flights that were operated by the airline on a programme basis similar to scheduled flights, but {{were not part of}} the air services agreement between their respective countries. The airline was granted scheduled services rights in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Despite closer {{co-operation}} {{and improvements}} {{made to the}} Bakerloo stations <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> parts of the network, the Underground railways continued to struggle financially. The UERL's ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenue, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had {{a negative impact on}} the profitability of the whole UERL group.|$|E
5|$|From the 1860s Cornish mines faced {{competition}} from cheap metal imports, and legislation {{introduced in the}} 1870s limited the use of child labour. The Cornish mining system went into terminal decline, leading to a collapse of the local economy and mass emigration both overseas <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> parts of the United Kingdom. In 1891 the number of bal maidens had fallen to half its peak, and by {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in 1914 very few remained in employment. In 1921 Dolcoath mine, the last employer of bal maidens, ceased operations, bringing the tradition to an end. Other than women recruited for ore processing at Geevor as a result of labour shortages during the Second World War, and a very limited number of female workers after the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 banned the practice of recruiting only male mineworkers, women never again performed manual labour in Cornish mines. The last surviving bal maiden died in 1968, and with the closure of South Crofty tin mine in 1998, Cornish metals mining came to an end.|$|E
5|$|Having been a {{professional}} musician since the mid-'60s (and the guitarist for King Crimson since 1969), {{by the late}} 1980s Robert Fripp found himself in conflict with his longtime record label E.G.Records and management company (E.G. Management) over royalties allegedly owed by E.G. to himself <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> band members. During this period, Fripp met and began working with producer and online developer David Singleton, initially on a Guitar Craft tour in 1990 and subsequently on the production of two albums - the League of Crafty Guitarists' Show of Hands and the eponymous album for the Fripp-and-Toyah-fronted group Sunday All Over the World. Fripp and Singleton's production partnership was sealed by work on two King Crimson boxed sets (1991's Frame by Frame and 1992's The Great Deceiver) and continues {{to the present day}} under the name of TonProb.|$|E

5|$|In 1962–1966, {{there were}} {{attempts}} in the United States to produce transplutonium isotopes using {{a series of}} six underground nuclear explosions. Small samples of rock were extracted from the blast area immediately after the test to study the explosion products, but no isotopes with mass number greater than 257 could be detected, despite predictions that such isotopes would have relatively long half-lives of α-decay. This inobservation was attributed to spontaneous fission owing to the large speed of the products <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> decay channels, such as neutron emission and nuclear fission.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Trieste, then subject to Austrian rule, the Jewish {{community}} saw positive change under Maria Theresa's rule. On 19 April 1771, Maria Theresa granted two Sovereign Licenses to the Jews of Trieste, licenses that constitute real regulations. In 1782, with the famous Edict of Tolerance, her son Joseph II admitted the Jews to some charges in the Stock Exchange <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> liberal professions. A year later the Jewish primary school was opened {{with the name of}} Scuole Pie Normali Israelitiche. The following year, in 1784, the gates of the Ghetto were opened so that the Jews of Trieste could live together with their fellow citizens of different religions; however most of them continued to live in the Ghetto. Maria Theresa's influence and personal prejudices were limited by the 1780s, and the Jews of Trieste lived in relative peace until the beginning of French rule in the region.|$|E
5|$|Like the UK as a whole, the Northern English {{economy is}} now {{dominated}} by the service sector – as of September 2016, 82.2% of workers in the Northern statistical regions were employed in services, compared to 83.7% for the UK as a whole. Manufacturing now employs 9.5%, compared to {{the national average of}} 7.6%. The unemployment rate in Northern England is 5.3% compared to an England-wide and UK-wide average of 4.8%, and the North East has the highest unemployment rate in the UK, at 7.0% as of December 2016, more than one percentage point higher than any other region. As of 2015, the gross value added (GVA) of the Northern English economy was £316 billion, and if it were an independent nation, it would be the tenth largest economy in Europe. The region does have poor growth and productivity rates compared to Southern England <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> EU countries.|$|E

Years can pass before the condition is recognized. Some TBI are so small {{that they do not have}} significant clinical manifestations; they may never be noticed or diagnosed and may heal without intervention.|$|E

5|$|The diet of the yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} is {{varied and}} available {{from a range}} of habitats within its distribution, which reduces their vulnerability to degradation or change in habitat. Much of the diet comprises seeds of native trees, particularly she-oaks (Allocasuarina and Casuarina, including A.torulosa and A.verticillata), but also Eucalyptus (including E.maculata flowers and E.nitida seeds), Acacia (including gum exudate and galls), Banksia (including the green seed pods and seeds of B.serrata, B.integrifolia, and B.marginata), and Hakea species (including H.gibbosa, H.rugosa, H.nodosa, H.sericea, H.cycloptera, and H.dactyloides). They are also partial to pine cones in plantations of the introduced Pinus radiata <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> introduced trees, including Cupressus torulosa, Betula pendula and the buds of elm Ulmus species. In the Eyre Peninsula, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo has become dependent on the introduced Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), alongside native species.|$|E
