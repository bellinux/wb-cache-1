5|$|In his Commentary on Isaiah (1529), Zwingli {{noted that}} there were three kinds of governments: monarchy, <b>aristocracy,</b> and democracy. He {{expressed}} his preference for <b>aristocracy</b> which is not surprising given his experience with the Zürich council. In the publication, rather than comparing the three forms of government, he gave a defence of <b>aristocracy</b> against a monarchy. He argued that a monarchy would invariably descend to tyranny. A monarchy had inherent weaknesses in that a good ruler could be easily replaced by a bad one or a single ruler could be easily corrupted. An <b>aristocracy</b> with more people involved did not have these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|In the 8th and 9th centuries, {{civil service}} {{constituted}} the clearest path to aristocratic status, but, {{starting in the}} 9th century, the civil <b>aristocracy</b> was rivalled by an <b>aristocracy</b> of nobility. According to some studies of Byzantine government, 11th-century politics were dominated by competition between the civil and the military <b>aristocracy.</b> During this period, Alexios I undertook important administrative reforms, including {{the creation of new}} courtly dignities and offices.|$|E

Wollstonecraft's was the first response in a pamphlet war sparked by the publication of Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), a defense of constitutional monarchy, <b>aristocracy,</b> and the Church of England.|$|E

5|$|The Macedonian {{king was}} an autocratic figure {{at the head}} of both {{government}} and society, with arguably unlimited authority to handle affairs of state and public policy, but he was also the leader of a very personal regime with close relationships or connections to his hetairoi, the core of the Macedonian <b>aristocracy.</b> These aristocrats were second only to the king in terms of power and privilege, filling the ranks of his administration and serving as commanding officers in the military. It was in the more bureaucratic regimes of the Hellenistic kingdoms that succeeded Alexander the Great's empire where greater social mobility for members of society seeking to join the <b>aristocracy</b> could be found, especially in Ptolemaic Egypt. Although governed by a king and martial <b>aristocracy,</b> Macedonia seems to have lacked the widespread use of slaves seen in contemporaneous Greek states.|$|E
5|$|The lavishness of the {{architecture}} that was to arise from this disaster is connected with the politics of Sicily at the time; Sicily was still officially under Spanish rule, but rule was effectively delegated to the native <b>aristocracy.</b> This was led by the Duke of Camastra, whom the Spanish had appointed viceroy to appease the <b>aristocracy,</b> who were numerous. The <b>aristocracy</b> was relatively concentrated compared to most of Europe, and a gentry class was missing. In the 18th century, one estimate held that there were 228 noble families, who provided Sicily with a ruling class consisting of 58 princes, 27 dukes, 37 marquesses, 26 Counts, one viscount and 79 barons; the Golden Book of the Sicilian nobility (last published in 1926) lists even more. In addition to these were the younger scions of the families, with their courtesy titles of nobile or baron.|$|E

5|$|Scattered evidence, {{including}} the records in Irish annals {{and the images}} of warriors like those depicted on the Pictish stone slabs at Aberlemno, Forfarshire and Hilton of Cadboll in Easter Ross, suggest that in Northern Britain, as in Anglo-Saxon England, society was dominated by a military <b>aristocracy,</b> whose status was dependent in a large part on their ability and willingness to fight. Below {{the level of the}} <b>aristocracy</b> it is assumed that there were non-noble freemen, working their own small farms or holding lands as free tenants. There are no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period, but codes in Ireland and Wales indicate that freemen had the right to bear arms, represent themselves in law and to receive compensation for murdered kinsmen.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of antiquity, monarchy confronted several republican forms of government, wherein executive power was {{in the hands of}} a number of people, that elected leaders in a certain way instead of appointing them by hereditary succession. During the archaic period (c. 750–500 BCE), kingship disappeared in almost all Greek poleis, and also in Rome (then still a barely significant town). After the demise of kingship, the Greek city-states were initially most often led by nobility (<b>aristocracy),</b> after which their economic and military power base crumbled. Next, in almost all poleis tyrants usurped power for two generations (tyranny, 7th and especially 6th century BCE), after which gradually forms of governments led by the wealthy (oligarchy) or assemblies of free male citizens (democracy) emerged in Classical Greece (mainly after 500 BCE). Athenian democracy (6th century–322 BCE) is the best-known example of the latter form; classical Sparta (c. 550–371 BCE) was a militaristic polis with a remarkable mix between monarchy (dual kingship), <b>aristocracy</b> (Gerousia) and democracy (Apella); the Roman Republic (c. 509–27 BCE) had a mixed constitution of oligarchy, democracy and especially <b>aristocracy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>aristocracy</b> {{shared their}} power {{only with the}} Roman Catholic Church. The Church ruled by fear of damnation in the next life and of the Inquisition in the present, and {{consequently}} both upper and lower classes gave as generously as they could on all major saints' days. Many priests and bishops {{were members of the}} <b>aristocracy.</b> The wealth of the Church in Sicily was further enhanced by the tradition of pressing younger children of the <b>aristocracy</b> to enter monasteries and convents, in order to preserve the family estates from division; a large fee, or dowry, was usually paid to the Church to facilitate this, in the form of property, jewels, or money. Thus the wealth of certain religious orders grew out of all proportion to the economic growth of any other group at this time. This {{is one of the reasons}} that so many of the Sicilian Baroque churches and monasteries, such as San Martino delle Scale, were rebuilt after 1693 on such a lavish scale.|$|E
