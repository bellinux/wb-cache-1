50|$|The geopolitical {{component}} of <b>a</b> <b>material’s</b> supply risk {{takes into account}} how governmental decisions and stability can significantly impact <b>a</b> <b>material’s</b> accessibility. For example, politically unstable and war-torn nations pose a greater risk to supply restriction than developed peaceful nations.

5|$|After 1872, steel {{started to}} be {{introduced}} as <b>a</b> <b>material</b> for construction. Compared to iron, steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight. The French Navy led the way {{with the use of}} steel in its fleet, starting with the , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876.

He devised a simple apparatus that consisted of a cylinder containing a polonium source and beryllium target. The resulting radiation could then be directed at <b>a</b> <b>material</b> such as paraffin wax; the displaced particles, which were protons, would go into a small ionisation chamber where they could be detected with an oscilloscope.|$|E

5|$|Ductility is an {{important}} factor in ensuring the integrity of structures by enabling them to sustain local stress concentrations without fracture. In addition, structures are required to be of an acceptable strength, which is related to a material's yield strength. In general, as the yield strength of <b>a</b> <b>material</b> increases, there is a corresponding reduction in fracture toughness.|$|E
5|$|For Reyner Banham, Tange was a prime {{exemplar of}} the use of Brutalist architecture. His use of Béton brut {{concrete}} finishes in a raw and undecorated way combined with his civic projects such as the redevelopment of Tokyo Bay made him a great influence on British architects during the 1960s. Brutalist architecture has been criticised for being soulless and for promoting the exclusive use of <b>a</b> <b>material</b> that is poor at withstanding long exposures to natural weather.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{sculpture}} {{experienced a}} renaissance during the Kamakura period, {{led by the}} Kei school. Partially influenced by Song dynasty China, their sculpture is characterised by realism featuring elaborate top knots, jewelry, and wavy drapery. Although predominantly wooden, bronze was also used as <b>a</b> <b>material</b> for the statues. As a novelty, portrait sculptures of prominent monks were created adjacent to the depiction of Buddhist deities.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>material's</b> certification, {{essentially}} <b>a</b> {{report of}} its composition and properties, may be forged. <b>A</b> low-property <b>material,</b> produced for lower cost, may be passed as <b>a</b> higher-property <b>material,</b> which has <b>a</b> higher price.

An analysis approach to derive <b>a</b> <b>material's</b> complex dielectric function from observed transmittance spectra in the far-infrared and submillimeter regimes is presented.

5|$|Quantities {{of atoms}} {{are found in}} {{different}} states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as temperature and pressure. By varying the conditions, materials can transition between solids, liquids, gases and plasmas. Within a state, <b>a</b> <b>material</b> can also exist in different allotropes. An {{example of this is}} solid carbon, which can exist as graphite or diamond. Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as dioxygen and ozone.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is caused}} by interference effects rather than by pigments.
