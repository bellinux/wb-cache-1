2500|$|Deep-sea photography, {{recovered}} artifacts, and {{an evaluation}} of her design and operational history permitted a Court of Inquiry to conclude Thresher had probably suffered {{the failure of a}} salt-water piping system joint which relied heavily on silver brazing instead of welding; earlier tests using ultrasound equipment found potential problems with about 14% of the tested brazed joints, most of which were determined not to pose a risk significant enough to require a repair. High-pressure water spraying from a broken pipe joint may have shorted out one of the many electrical panels, causing a shutdown ("scram") of the reactor, with a subsequent loss of propulsion. The inability to blow the ballast tanks was later attributed to excessive moisture in the submarine's high-pressure air flasks, moisture which froze and plugged the flasks' flowpaths while passing through the valves. This was later simulated in dock-side tests on Threshers sister sub, [...] During a test to simulate blowing ballast at or near test depth, ice formed on strainers installed in valves; the flow of air lasted only a few seconds. <b>Air</b> <b>dryers</b> were later retrofitted to the high-pressure air compressors, beginning with Tinosa, to permit the emergency blow system to operate properly.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of hand hygiene {{in reducing the}} spread of pathogens has been long established {{and this has been}} highlighted recently in initiatives such as the NHS’s ‘clean your hands’ campaign. However, much of the focus on hand hygiene has concerned effective hand washing; there has been less emphasis on hand drying and its role in hygienic practices. This study aimed to compare three hand drying methods namely paper towels, a warm <b>air</b> <b>dryer</b> and a jet <b>air</b> <b>dryer</b> for their relative ability to disseminate virus particles into the washroom environment during hand drying. A bacteriophage model was used to compare these methods; hands were artificially contaminated with MS 2 phage and dried using each device. Both air sampling and contact plates were assessed and a plaque assay was used to quantify virus dissemination. Samples were collected at set times, heights, angles and distances around each device. Both air sampling and contact plate results indicated that the jet <b>air</b> <b>dryer</b> produced significantly more virus dispersal than either paper towels or the warm <b>air</b> <b>dryer</b> in terms of quantity, distance travelled and the time spent circulating in the air around the device and potentially in the washroom environment...|$|R

50|$|Typically, the {{compressed}} air is first filtered with a high-quality coalescing filter. This filter removes liquid water, oil and particulate from {{the compressed}} air. The water vapor-laden air then {{passes through the}} center bore of hollow fibers in the membrane bundle. At the same time, {{a small portion of}} the dry air product is redirected along the outside surface of the fibers to sweep out the water vapor which has permeated the membrane. The moisture-laden sweep gas is then vented to the atmosphere, and clean, dry air is supplied to the application.

40|$|AbstractComparison of drying {{characteristics}} of Thompson seedless grapes using combined microwave oven and hot <b>air</b> cabinet <b>dryer</b> was investigated. The drying rate curves indicated {{the absence of}} a constant-rate drying period in all drying methods. Within a certain microwave power range (75 – 900 W in the current study), increasing microwave power speeds up the drying process, thus shortening the drying time. No benefits were seen when increasing drying time from 30 to 120 min when grapes drying started in hot <b>air</b> cabinet <b>dryer</b> and finished in microwave oven for 1 min at any power level. The higher value of energy consumption during grapes drying belonged to hot <b>air</b> cabinet <b>dryer</b> alone as drying method with value of 564. 5 MJ/kgwater evaporated.

50|$|Industrial food {{dehydration}} {{is often}} accomplished by freeze-drying. In this case food is flash frozen {{and put into}} a reduced-pressure system which causes the water to sublimate directly from the solid to the gaseous phase.

Industrial hot <b>air</b> <b>dryers</b> are simple and easy to design, construct and maintain.

50|$|Refrigeration dryers employ two heat {{exchanger}}s, one for air-to-air {{and one for}} air-to-refrigeration.

Older and larger dryers still use R-22 and R-404a refrigerants. The goal of having two heat exchangers is that the cold outgoing air cools down the hot incoming air and reduces the size of compressor required. At the same time the increase in the temperature of outgoing air prevents re-condensation.|$|E

50|$|Membrane <b>air</b> <b>dryers</b> depress the {{incoming}} dew point. Most dryers have a challenge air dew point and pressure specification. So if the inlet dew point {{is lower than}} the specified challenge air then the outlet dew point is even lower than specified. For example, a dryer could be rated at a −40 °F dew point with a challenge of +70 °F dew point and 100 psig. If {{the incoming}} air has an inlet dew point of only 32 °F, the outlet dew point will be somewhat less. Pressure also plays a role. If the pressure is higher than the rated specification then the outlet dew point will be lowered. This lowering of the outlet dew point is due to the longer residence time that the air has inside the membrane. Using the spec above, an operating pressure of 120 psig will yield a lower outlet dew point than specified. The extent of the improvement is dependent {{on the nature of the}} membrane and could vary among manufacturers.|$|E
