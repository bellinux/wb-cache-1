40|$|This paper proposes an {{ontology}} modelling {{approach for}} <b>assisting</b> <b>vehicle</b> drivers through safety warning messages during time critical situation. Intelligent Driver Assistance System (I-DAS) {{is a major}} component of InVANET[12], which focuses on generating the alert messages based on the context aware parameters such as driving situations, vehicle dynamics, driver activity and environment. I-DAS manages the parameter representation, consistent update /maintenance in XML format while the interpretation of a critical situation is done using ontology modeling. Related safety technologies such as Adaptive Cruise Control, Collision Avoidance System, Lane Departure Warning System, Driver Drowsiness detection system, Parking Assistance System, which generate warnings and alerts to driver continuously, for assistance according to context which is integrated in Vehicle and Vehicle 2 Driver (V 2 D) communications by DVI(Driver Vehicle Interface) had been applied. The simulation test bed developed using Java framework[21] to generate safety alerts in various driving situations shows the usefulness of this approach. The response time graph for the simulation of context I-DAS is depicted and analysed. The effective performance of the driving scenarios in various modes like day and night for single, 2 -way and 4 -way road scenario for the best, worst and average cases of simulation had been studied. The system works in VANET scenario, which needs to be adaptive for environment changes and to vary according to the context. The presented approach shows the simulation that can be implemented to all vehicles in real time scenario with promising results...|$|E

50|$|A major {{fault of}} Route 18 north of Bridgewater is its {{intersection}} patterns. At all lights north of Bridgewater center, the road widens to four lanes temporarily, {{before and after}} the intersection. While this helps alleviate backups at the lights and <b>assists</b> <b>vehicles</b> turning left off of the route, it creates bottlenecks after the intersection, where the two lanes re-merge into one. To help this, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation's Highway Division will be widening the section of Route 18 from Highland Place in Weymouth to Route 139 in Abington from two to four lanes.

40|$|When {{designing}} a safety system, {{the faster the}} response time, the greater the reflexes of the system to hazards. As more commercial interest in autonomous and <b>assisted</b> <b>vehicles</b> grows, the number one concern is safety. If the system cannot react as fast as or faster than an average human, then the public will deem it unsafe. In this thesis, I explore the feasibility of using GPU hardware to perform the algorithms used for determining robotic obstacle avoidance. These obstacle avoidance algorithms are ideally suited to reacting to emergency hazards. The product of this research will be a libarary of OpenCL accelerated functions designed for processing environmental data from LiDAR sensors.

Aiming at Chery A 3 sedan, set up the active braking control dynamic simulation system base on MATLAB/Simulink. Adopting the brake driving integration ESP control strategy, analyze and verify the stability control performance of independent vehicle system and vehicle ESP test system based on active braking control respectively in under steering and excessive steering two test conditions. The analyzing results indicate that the test system based on active braking control can effectively <b>assist</b> <b>vehicle</b> travelling in the absence of ESP control or ESP control system failure; when vehicle has ESP control system, the driving stability control performance of this system and independent vehicle system has remarkable consistency. The active braking control system provides a basis for research of vehicle driving stability control test. 1...|$|R

VANETs {{are one of the}} influencing areas for the improvement of intelligent transportation system (ITS) in order to provide safety and comfort to the road users. VANETs <b>assist</b> <b>vehicle</b> drivers to communicate and coordinate among themselves in order to avoid any critical situation through vehicle to vehicle information exchanges, e.g., road accidents, traffic jams, speed violation, and unseen obstacles, etc. Besides safety applications, VANETs also provide entertainment-related applications among drivers. For example, weather information, mobile e-commerce, Internet access, and other multimedia services. Although being a subclass of MANETs, VANETs have many unique characters different from traditional MANETs. The most significant differences are the special mobility pattern and rapid changing topology, so it might not be effective to apply the existing routing protocols from MANETs to VANETs.|$|R

30|$|Basically, a VANET is {{organized}} with heterogeneous connections, supporting inter-vehicle, vehicle-to-station, and inter-station communications. Inter-vehicle as V 2 V communication is unstable due to high-mobility {{vehicles on the}} roadway. Road-side stations (RSUs) are deployed on the roadside to <b>assist</b> <b>vehicles</b> in Internet connection and obtaining key-related materials. Most key materials for VANETs are mainly to safeguard the propagation information. A reliable propagation of traffic-related information is essential, so that vehicles can travel safely and keep the traffic flowing freely over the roadway. It is a challenge that a vehicle authenticates the incoming traffic notifications of vehicles {{next to each other}} using ad hoc key cryptography. Multi-hop routing in V 2 I mode is hard to achieve directly and timely significant traffic propagation between any two neighboring vehicles. In addition, the deployment of RSUs on each roadside to cover all moving vehicles is impossible. Real-time safety applications always achieve the purpose of accident avoidance and cooperative driving in VANETs. The data propagation in the V 2 V mode without a propagation schedule will induce the problems of communication collision and broadcast storms.|$|R
