25|$|Almost {{everyone}} I've {{talked to}} says, 'We're gonna move to Houston.' What I'm hearing, {{which is sort}} of scary, is they all want to stay in Texas... Everybody is so overwhelmed by the hospitality, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the people in the arenas here, you know, were underprivileged anyway, so this (as she chuckles slightly) is working very well for them.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{education}} is not available in the village, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Yatton's children commute daily to the nearby village of Backwell in order to attend Backwell School. The school is a specialist Arts College, and includes a sixth form and takes pupils {{from the age of}} 11 (Year 7) to the age of 18 (Year 13). In November 2008, Backwell School was rated as outstanding by Ofsted.|$|E
25|$|Early in Korean history, the shamanistic {{religion}} was dominant and because early Korea was divided often into smaller domains, such as Silla and Goguryeo, Baekje, the folktales and myths tended to differ also by those regions. With {{the arrival of}} Buddhism in the 3-4th century, the myths and native religion began to change as did the myths. With the advent of Neo Confucianism, the native {{religion was}} suppressed by the government where shamans were often killed for practicing <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the legends either changed or were blended into existing legends.|$|E

25|$|The Soviets {{deployed}} three brigades with armor {{support to}} open the road connections to the encircled divisions but Finnish efforts prevented them. Renewed attacks distracted the Finns enough to allow the encircled Soviet forces to escape through the dense forests by abandoning their heavy equipment. Given {{the element of surprise}} and due to the superior numbers of the Soviets, the Finnish troops guarding the encircled divisions had little hope of containing organized breakouts, especially in the forests, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the encircled Soviets managed to escape to their own side with the last escaping on August 10.|$|E
500|$|The {{first series}} was {{therefore}} the first BBC radio comedy to use stereophonic techniques. Adams later {{said that before}} Hitchhiker's, stereo was deemed impossible for radio comedy and after it was made compulsory. Producer Geoffrey Perkins recalled that the technology available in 1978 for mixing sound effects at the BBC's Paris Theatre radio studio was limited. The production had one eight track tape recorder at their disposal <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the effects in the programme were mixed [...] "live" [...] with tape loops of background sound effects strung around the recording studio. Actors whose speech needed to be modified in post-production by Radiophonic technicians, such as Stephen Moore's performance as Marvin the Android, were recorded in isolation from the main [...] "humanoid" [...] characters. Allegedly, Moore recorded most of his performance in a cupboard and met the other actors only after the first session was complete.|$|E
500|$|Marcy {{suggested}} Soulé {{confer with}} Buchanan and John Y. Mason, Minister to France, on U.S. policy toward Cuba. He had previously written to Soulé that, if Cuba's purchase {{could not be}} negotiated, [...] "you will then direct your effort to the next desirable object, which is to detach that island from the Spanish dominion and from all dependence on any European power"—words Soulé may have adapted to fit his own agenda. Authors David Potter and Lars Schoultz both note the considerable ambiguity in Marcy's cryptic words, and Samuel Bemis suggests he may have referred to Cuban independence, but acknowledges {{it is impossible to}} know Marcy's true intent. In any case, Marcy had also written in June that the administration had abandoned thoughts of declaring war over Cuba. But Robert May writes, [...] "the instructions for the conference had been so vague, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Marcy's letters to Soulé since the Black Warrior incident had been bellicose, that the ministers misread the administration's intent." ...|$|E

500|$|... "to willingly allow {{anyone to}} hijack this {{tradition}} that means {{so much to}} millions of Americans <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> our own fans for any cause would effectively be just as disrespectful as doing it ourselves." [...] Rapinoe expressed displeasure with this move saying [...] "it was incredibly distasteful, four days before {{one of the worst}} tragedies in our country, to say I tried to hijack this event." [...] She continued the protest on September 15, 2016 during the national team game against Thailand. [...] U.S. Soccer then issued a statement saying: [...] "Representing your country is a privilege and honor for any player or coach that is associated with U.S. Soccer's National Teams. Therefore, our national anthem has particular significance for U.S. Soccer. In front of national and often global audiences, the playing of our national anthem is an opportunity for our Men's and Women's National Team players and coaches to reflect upon the liberties and freedom we all appreciate in this country. As part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played." ...|$|E
500|$|After season six, Mirkin {{suggested}} Oakley and Weinstein {{take over}} as showrunners, but remained on the show in an advisory capacity, helping them with technical aspects of the show such as editing and sound mixing, and attending table readings of the scripts. He was the executive producer for three other episodes from season seven: [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian", [...] "Radioactive Man" [...] and [...] "Team Homer". [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] was approved by Mirkin after the story was pitched by Cohen; Mirkin had just become a vegetarian himself, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Lisa's experiences in the episode were based on his own. Mirkin flew to London to record the episode's guest stars Paul and Linda McCartney at Paul's recording studio, where the McCartneys spent an hour recording their parts. Mirkin later said that recording with the McCartneys {{was one of the}} most [...] "amazing" [...] experiences of his life and considers the episode to be one of his favorites. Mirkin returned to the role of showrunner to produce the episodes [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] and [...] "All Singing, All Dancing" [...] for season nine. He pitched the plot for [...] "The Joy of Sect", because he was attracted to the notion of parodies of cults, calling them [...] "comical, interesting and twisted".|$|E
2500|$|Fort Collins {{is known}} along with Marceline, Missouri {{as one of}} the towns that {{inspired}} the design of Main Street, U.S.A. [...] inside the main entrance of the many [...] "Disneyland"-style parks run by The Walt Disney Company around the world. Harper Goff, who worked on Main Street, U.S.A. with Walt, showed Walt some photos of his childhood home of Fort Collins, Colorado. Walt liked the look, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the features of the town were incorporated into Main Street, U.S.A.|$|E

2500|$|... "Given these {{judgments}} of the Soviet future made by {{political leaders and}} journalists, {{the question is why}} were they right <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> our Sovietological colleagues wrong. The answer again in part must be ideological. Reagan and Levin came from rightist backgrounds, and Moynihan, much like the leaders of the AFL-CIO, from a leftist anti-Stalinist social-democratic milieu, environments that disposed participants to believe the worst. Most of the Sovietologists, on the other hand, were left-liberal in their politics, an orientation that undermined their capacity to accept the view that economic statism, planning, socialist incentives, would not work. They were also for the most part ignorant of, or ignored, the basic Marxist formulation {{that it is impossible to}} build socialism in impoverished societies." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} {{development}} of the game, formations were much more offensively aggressive, with the 1–2–7 being prominent in the late 1800s. In {{the latter part of}} the 19th century, the 2–3–5 formation became widely used and the position names became more refined to reflect this. In defence, there were full-backs, known as the left-back and right-back; in midfield, left-half, centre-half and right-half; and for the forward line there were outside-left (or left wing), inside-left, centre-forward, inside-right and outside-right (or right wing). As the game has evolved, tactics and team formations have changed <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the names of the positions have changed to reflect their duties in the modern game (though some old familiar ones remain). The term [...] "half-back" [...] fell out of use by the early 1970s and [...] "midfield" [...] was used in naming the positions that play around the middle third as in centre midfield and wide midfield.|$|E

50|$|In 1889, a major flood {{happened}} in Totsukawa. The flood destroyed <b>many</b> homes <b>and</b> farms, <b>so,</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Totsukawa’s people moved to Hokkaido (the northernmost tip of Japan). And {{they developed a}} new village there. It was named “Shintotsukawa”. “Shintotsukawa” means “New Totsukawa” in Japanese.|$|R
