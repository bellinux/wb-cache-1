5|$|Acetic {{anhydride}} is an <b>acetylation</b> agent. As such, {{its major}} application is for cellulose acetate, a synthetic textile {{also used for}} photographic film. Acetic anhydride is also a reagent {{for the production of}} heroin and other compounds.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to {{salicylic}} acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. <b>Acetylation</b> of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These <b>acetylation</b> reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA {{is held in}} complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and <b>acetylation.</b> These chemical changes alter {{the strength of the}} interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|Although histone {{modifications}} occur {{throughout the}} entire sequence, the unstructured N-termini of histones (called histone tails) are particularly highly modified. These modifications include <b>acetylation,</b> methylation, ubiquitylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, ribosylation and citrullination. <b>Acetylation</b> is the most highly studied of these modifications. For example, <b>acetylation</b> of the K14 and K9 lysines of the tail of histone H3 by histone acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs) is generally related to transcriptional competence.|$|E
25|$|Cyanohydrin {{reaction}} between {{potassium cyanide}} and 3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzaldehyde followed by <b>acetylation</b> and reduction.|$|E
25|$|Another {{implication}} of histone <b>acetylation</b> {{is to provide}} a platform for protein binding. As a posttranslational modification, the <b>acetylation</b> of histones can attract proteins to elongated chromatin that has been marked by acetyl groups. It has been hypothesized that the histone tails offer recognition sites that attract proteins responsible for transcriptional activation. Unlike histone core proteins, histone tails {{are not part of the}} nucleosome core and are exposed to protein interaction. A model proposed that the <b>acetylation</b> of H3 histones activates gene transcription by attracting other transcription related complexes. Therefore, the acetyl mark provides a site for protein recognition where transcription factors interact with the acetylated histone tails via their bromodomain.|$|E
25|$|Chromatin {{structure}} oriented factors. Based on histone post translational modifications - phosphorylation, <b>acetylation,</b> methylation and ubiquination.|$|E
25|$|This {{interaction}} induces conformational {{changes in}} the catalytic center of Naa10 that allows the <b>acetylation</b> of conventional NatA substrates.|$|E
25|$|The Nencki {{reaction}} (1881) is {{the ring}} <b>acetylation</b> of phenols with acids {{in the presence}} of zinc chloride.|$|E
25|$|Chromatin and its {{interaction}} with enzymes has been researched, and a conclusion being made {{is that it}} is relevant and an important factor in gene expression. Vincent G. Allfrey, a professor at Rockefeller University, stated that RNA synthesis is related to histone <b>acetylation.</b> The lysine amino acid attached {{to the end of the}} histones is positively charged. The <b>acetylation</b> of these tails would make the chromatin ends neutral, allowing for DNA access.|$|E
25|$|Direct <b>acetylation</b> of the {{estrogen}} receptor alpha at the lysine residues in hinge {{region by}} p300 regulates transactivation and hormone sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{enrichment}} {{in individuals}} {{is associated with}} increased hippocampal gene histone <b>acetylation</b> and thus improved memory consolidation (notably spatial memory).|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetylation</b> has {{the effect}} of {{changing}} the overall charge of the histone tail from positive to neutral. Nucleosome formation is dependent on the positive charges of the H4 histones and the negative charge on the surface of H2A histone fold domains. <b>Acetylation</b> of the histone tails disrupts this association, leading to weaker binding of the nucleosomal components. By doing this, the DNA is more accessible and leads to more transcription factors being able to reach the DNA. Thus, <b>acetylation</b> of histones is known to increase the expression of genes through transcription activation. Deacetylation performed by HDAC molecules has the opposite effect. By deacetylating the histone tails, the DNA becomes more tightly wrapped around the histone cores, making it harder for transcription factors to bind to the DNA. This leads to decreased levels of gene expression and is known as gene silencing.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{comparisons}} of identical twins constitute an optimal model for interrogating environmental epigenetics. In {{the case of}} humans with different environmental exposures, monozygotic (identical) twins were epigenetically indistinguishable during their early years, while older twins had remarkable differences in the overall content and genomic distribution of 5-methylcytosine DNA and histone <b>acetylation.</b> The twin pairs who had spent less of their lifetime together and/or had greater differences in their medical histories were those who showed the largest differences in their levels of 5-methylcytosine DNA and <b>acetylation</b> of histones H3 and H4.|$|E
25|$|Pantothenic acid in {{the form}} of CoA is also {{required}} for acylation and <b>acetylation,</b> which, for example, are involved in signal transduction and enzyme activation and deactivation, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Cellulose dissolves in aqueous {{solutions}} of ZnCl2, and zinc-cellulose complexes {{have been}} detected. Cellulose also dissolves in molten ZnCl2 hydrate and carboxylation and <b>acetylation</b> {{performed on the}} cellulose polymer.|$|E
25|$|In principle, NatA can {{assemble}} {{from all}} the Naa10 and Naa15 isoforms in human and mouse, creating a more complex and flexible system for Nα-terminal <b>acetylation</b> as compared to lower eukaryotes.|$|E
25|$|Some {{plants such}} as sugar beet, {{potatoes}} and pears contain pectins with acetylated galacturonic acid in addition to methyl esters. <b>Acetylation</b> prevents gel-formation but increases the stabilising and emulsifying effects of pectin.|$|E
25|$|Beyond genetics, {{epigenetic}} abnormality {{related to}} DNA methylation, histone <b>acetylation,</b> or microRNA expression probably have key {{roles in the}} pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including SS, though {{research in this area}} is very limited and minimal.|$|E
25|$|Differing histone {{modifications}} {{are likely}} to function in differing ways; <b>acetylation</b> at one position is likely to function differently from <b>acetylation</b> at another position. Also, multiple modifications may occur at the same time, and these modifications may work together to change {{the behavior of the}} nucleosome. The idea that multiple dynamic modifications regulate gene transcription in a systematic and reproducible way is called the histone code, although the idea that histone state can be read linearly as a digital information carrier has been largely debunked. One of the best-understood systems that orchestrates chromatin-based silencing is the SIR protein based silencing of the yeast hidden mating type loci HML and HMR.|$|E
25|$|Approved in 2006 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Vorinostat {{represents}} {{a new category}} for anticancer drugs that are in development. Vorinostat targets histone <b>acetylation</b> mechanisms and can effectively inhibit abnormal chromatin remodeling in cancerous cells. Targets of Vorinostat includes HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC6.|$|E
25|$|Suggested by {{the idea}} that the {{structure}} of chromatin can be modified to allow or deny access of transcription activators, regulatory functions of histone <b>acetylation</b> and deacetylation can have implications with genes that cause other diseases. Studies on histone modifications may reveal many novel therapeutic targets.|$|E
25|$|Gene {{expression}} is regulated by histone <b>acetylation</b> and deacetylation, and this regulation is also applicable to inflammatory genes. Inflammatory lung diseases {{are characterized by}} expression of specific inflammatory genes such as NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factor. Treatments with corticosteroids and theophylline for inflammatory lung diseases interfere with HAT/HDAC activity to turn off inflammatory genes.|$|E
25|$|Because the Edman {{degradation}} {{proceeds from}} the N-terminus of the protein, it will not work if the N-terminus has been chemically modified (e.g. by <b>acetylation</b> or formation of Pyroglutamic acid). Edman degradation is generally not useful to determine the positions of disulfide bridges. It also requires peptide amounts of 1 picomole or above for discernible results, making it less sensitive than mass spectrometry.|$|E
25|$|Pyruvate {{dehydrogenase}} (E1) {{performs the}} first two reactions within the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC): a decarboxylation of substrate 1 (pyruvate) and a reductive <b>acetylation</b> of substrate 2 (lipoic acid). Lipoic acid is covalently bound to dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2), which is the second catalytic component enzyme of PDC. The reaction catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) {{is considered to be}} the rate-limiting step for the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc).|$|E
25|$|Compared to the Xa, the Xi {{has high}} levels of DNA {{methylation}}, low levels of histone <b>acetylation,</b> low levels of histone H3 lysine-4 methylation, and {{high levels of}} histone H3 lysine-9 methylation and H3 lysine-27 methylation mark which is placed by the PRC2 complex recruited by Xist, all of which are associated with gene silencing. Additionally, a histone variant called macroH2A (H2AFY) is exclusively found on nucleosomes along the Xi.|$|E
25|$|Degree of <b>acetylation</b> (DA) for soluble {{chitosan}} {{ranges from}} 0% to 60%, depending on processing conditions. A {{study was conducted}} to characterize how varying DA affects the properties of chitosan. Varying DA was obtained using acetic anhydride or alkaline hydrolysis. It was found that decreasing <b>acetylation</b> created an increase in compressive strength. Biodegradation was examined by use of lysozyme, which is known to be mainly responsible for degrading chitosan in vivo by hydrolyzing its glycosidic bonds and is released by phagocytic cells after nerve injury. The results reveal that there was an accelerated mass loss with intermediate DAs, compared with high and low DAs over the time period studied. When DRG cells were grown on the N-acetylated chitosan, cell viability decreased with increasing DA. Also, chitosan has an increasing charge density with decreasing DA, which is responsible for greater cell adhesion. Thus, controlling the DA of chitosan is important for regulating the degradation time. This knowledge could help {{in the development of a}} nerve guidance conduit from chitosan.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{different}} cardiac hypertrophy models, {{it has been}} demonstrated that cardiac stress can result in gene expression changes and alter cardiac function. These changes are mediated through HATs/HDACs posttranslational modification signaling. HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A was reported to reduce stress induced cardiomyocyte autophagy. Studies on p300 and CREB-binding protein linked cardiac hypertrophy with cellular HAT activity suggesting an essential role of histone <b>acetylation</b> status with hypertrophy responsive genes such as GATA4, SRF, and MEF2.|$|E
25|$|Protein {{phosphorylation}} plays {{a crucial}} role in biological functions and controls nearly every cellular process, including metabolism, gene transcription and translation, cell-cycle progression, cytoskeletal rearrangement, protein-protein interactions, protein stability, cell movement, and apoptosis. These processes depend on the highly regulated and opposing actions of PKs and PPs, through changes in the phosphorylation of key proteins. Histone phosphorylation, along with methylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation and <b>acetylation,</b> also regulates access to DNA through chromatin reorganisation.|$|E
25|$|BDNF: BDNF is {{implicated in}} {{neurogenesis}} in the hippocampus, and {{studies suggest that}} depressed patients have decreased levels of BDNF and reduced hippocampal neurogenesis. It {{is not clear how}} neurogenesis restores mood, as ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis in murine models do not show anxiety related or depression related behaviours. Chronic imipramine administration results in increased histone <b>acetylation</b> (which is associated with transcriptional activation and decondensed chromatin) at the hippocampal BDNF promotor, and also reduced expression of hippocampal HDAC5.|$|E
25|$|Salvinorin A is one {{of several}} {{structurally}} related salvinorins found in the Salvia divinorum plant. SalvinorinA can be synthesized from the inactive salvinorinB by <b>acetylation.</b> The de-acetylated analog salvinorinB is devoid of human activity. 2-Mexothymethyl Salvinorin B is five- and seven-fold more potent at KOPr in GTP-γS assays than U50,488 and Salvinorin A, respectively; it has been demonstrated that some salvinorin A analogues may have anti-addictive properties in rats. SalvinorinA seems to be the only active naturally occurring salvinorin.|$|E
25|$|The acetyl {{group in}} 6.1 (Scheme 6) was removed to give primary alcohol 6.2. The Taxol ring (D) was added by an {{intramolecular}} nucleophilic substitution involving this hydroxyl group to give oxetane 6.3. After <b>acetylation,</b> phenyllithium {{was used to}} open the carbonate ester ring to give alcohol 6.5. Allylic oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate, sodium acetate, and celite gave ketone 6.6, which was subsequently reduced using sodium borohydride to give secondary alcohol 6.7. This was the last compound before {{the addition of the}} amide tail.|$|E
25|$|The {{peptides}} matched during protein identification do {{not necessarily}} include the N- or C-termini predicted for the matched protein. This may result from the N- or C-terminal peptides being difficult to identify by MS (e.g. being either too short or too long), being post-translationally modified (e.g. N-terminal <b>acetylation)</b> or genuinely differing from the prediction. Post-translational modifications or truncated termini may be identified by closer examination of the data (i.e. de novo sequencing). A repeat digest using a protease of different specificity may also be useful.|$|E
25|$|As {{indicated}} by its organic chemistry, Ac2O is mainly used for acetylations leading to commercially significant materials. Its largest application {{is for the}} conversion of cellulose to cellulose acetate, which is a component of photographic film and other coated materials, and {{is used in the}} manufacture of cigarette filters. Similarly it is used in the production of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), which is prepared by the <b>acetylation</b> of salicylic acid. It is also used as a wood preservative via autoclave impregnation to make a longer-lasting timber.|$|E
25|$|The bromodomain is a motif that is {{responsible}} for acetylated lysine recognition on histones by nucleosome remodelling proteins. Posttranslational modifications of N- and C-terminal histone tails attracts various transcription initiation factors that contain bromodomains, including human transcriptional coactivator PCAF, TAF1, GCN5 and CREB-binding protein(CBP), to the promoter and have a significance in regulating gene expression. Structural analysis of transcription factors has shown that highly conserved bromodomains are essential for protein to bind to acetylated lysine.This suggests that specific histone site <b>acetylation</b> has a regulatory role in gene transcriptional activation.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{regulatory}} role during transcription of epigenetic modifications in genes, {{it is not}} surprising that changes in epigenetic markers, such as <b>acetylation,</b> can contribute to cancer development. HDACs expression and activity in tumor cells is very different from normal cells. The overexpression and increased activity of HDACs has been shown to be characteristic of tumorigenesis and metastasis, suggesting an important regulatory role of histone deacetylation on oncogene expression. One of the examples is the regulation role of histone acetylation/deacetylation in P300 and CBP, both of which contribute to oncogenesis.|$|E
