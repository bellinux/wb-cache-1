5|$|After Hamilton's {{death in}} 1804, Elizabeth {{endeavored}} {{to preserve his}} legacy. She re-organized all of Alexander's letters, papers, and writings {{with the help of}} her son, John Church Hamilton, and persevered through many setbacks in getting his biography published. She was so devoted to Alexander's memory that she wore a small package <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> containing the pieces of a sonnet which Alexander wrote for her during the early days of their courtship.|$|E
5|$|Enraged upon {{learning}} the truth, Tiberius soon ordered more killings. Livilla committed suicide or was {{starved to death}} by her mother Antonia Minor. The remaining children of Sejanus, Capito Aelianus and Junilla, were executed in December of that year. According to ancient historians, {{because there was no}} precedent for the capital punishment of a virgin, Junilla was raped first, with the rope <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> Their bodies were thrown down the Gemonian stairs. At the beginning of the following year, damnatio memoriae was also passed on Livilla.|$|E

5|$|Wife {{selling in}} England {{was a way}} of ending an {{unsatisfactory}} marriage by mutual agreement that probably began in the late 17th century, when divorce was a practical impossibility for all but the very wealthiest. After parading his wife with a halter <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> arm, or waist, a husband would publicly auction her to the highest bidder. Wife selling provides the backdrop for Thomas Hardy's novel The Mayor of Casterbridge, in which the central character sells his wife {{at the beginning of the}} story, an act that haunts him for the rest of his life, and ultimately destroys him.|$|E
5|$|Gwendolyn: Marko's former fiancée, {{who joins}} The Will's {{pursuit of the}} family. Gwendolyn first appears {{at the end of}} issue #8, having been {{assigned}} by the Secretary General of Wreath High Command to check on The Will and helps him rescue Slave Girl from Sextillion in order to spur him to complete his mission. Marko and Alana's wedding rings, which also function as translator devices, were originally those of Gwendolyn's grandparents, who had the rings enchanted with a translator spell because they spoke two different dialects of Wreath's native language. She wears her grandparents' translation pendant <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> which was forged with the rings as part of the same set. She resists The Will's advances, though she reveals she loves him while attempting to get medical attention for him after he suffers a near-fatal injury.|$|E

5|$|Mulyo Hadi Purnomo, {{based in}} Semarang, was tasked with casting the minor roles. Bramantyo {{contacted}} the main cast members directly. Agus Kuncoro, who had acted in Sang Pencerah and {{was known for}} playing in Islamic-themed films, agreed to play Surya in ? immediately after reading the script. Singer Glenn Fredly was interested in playing Doni because he considered the character, an ultra-conservative Catholic, an interesting role, given the sensitive religious situation in the country. Revalina S. Temat, who had appeared in Bramantyo's 2009 film Perempuan Berkalung Sorban (The Girl With the Keffiyeh <b>Around</b> <b>Her</b> <b>Neck),</b> found her role as Menuk interesting and more serious than her recent work in horror films. Endhita, whom Bramantyo called for the role, expressed interest {{as soon as she}} received an outline of the plot.|$|E
5|$|On Monday 4 February, William {{bought some}} rope {{at the local}} grocer's shop, and {{spent the rest of}} the day observing cases at the Sheriff Court from the public gallery. He was later {{reported}} to have listened attentively to the proceedings. On 7 February, he attended the court sessions again. On 10 February, he visited his acquaintance, Walker, who lent him a newspaper that featured a woman's suicide by hanging. Walker asked Bury to look up any news of Jack the Ripper, at which Bury threw down the newspaper with a fright. That evening, he walked into the Dundee Central Police Station on Bell Street and reported his wife's suicide to Lieutenant James Parr. He said they had been drinking heavily the night before her death, and he had woken in the morning to find his wife's body on the floor with a rope <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> Bury had not summoned a doctor, but had instead cut the body and concealed it in one of the packing cases brought from London. Bury told Parr that his actions were now preying on his mind, and he was afraid that he would be arrested and accused of being Jack the Ripper.|$|E
5|$|One more legend narrated {{is about}} the goddess painted on a thangka in the monastery which is of Palden Lhamo. This female deity is {{compared}} to the Hindu Goddess Kali. Like Kali, Palden Lhamo's thangka is drawn in black colour, with flaming eyes, dressed in skirt made of tiger skin, and a garland of skulls <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> A moon disc adorns her hair, {{similar to the one}} seen on Shiva. She is also associated with Goddess Saraswati and Ma Tara. Legend also states that in the past she had lived in Sri Lanka as the consort of a demon king who practiced human sacrifice. As she was not supportive of this practice she fled from the kingdom. As she was running away, the king shot her shot with an arrow, which struck the backside of the mule that she was riding. When she drew out the arrow, it left a gaping hole in the mule's back, and through this gap Palden Lhamo could watch the teachings of Lord Buddha.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kesha waking {{up next to}} her love interest; she then {{proceeds}} to run away while being chased by the man. Kesha walks through the desert while split scenes of her are shown where she is riding an elephant and wearing a tiger mask while crawling around in the sand. They are later seen on a boat singing and pretending to row while digitally animated water is added. It then cuts to a scene of all animation in which Kesha is portrayed as a mermaid. The mermaid and the man share a kiss; the video then jumps to a scene on a rocky hillside with Kesha walking around the sand with the man standing above on a rock. The video then cuts to another scene where Kesha is covered in glow in the dark body paint while dancing around in a cave with a python <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> The video ends with Kesha and her lover sitting around a campfire while still in the desert.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{familiar with}} their new shadows, the party travels to Talta village, befriending Marumaro on the way, who also possesses a magical shadow. Finding that the villagers from Talta have started to head towards {{the capital city of}} Jibral, the party takes off after them. Just outside Jibral, the party finds the villagers attacked by Steel-Eating Tigers. They are saved by the arrival of King Jibral and his forces, including Zola. Once the villagers are brought to Jibral, the King decides to implement a plan to destroy one of Nene's bases near Jibral using Shu and his friends along with Zola. Together, the party works with the warriors of Talta Village the Jibral Kingdom to besiege Nene's Mechat base. After the base is destroyed, the party heads north in search of Nene. Nene captures Kluke, and places a collar <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> which Nene alleges will explode. After reaching Nene, Zola separates from the party to buy them time to attack Nene. When the party attempts to remove Kluke's collar, Nene absorbs the party's shadows by placing collars on all of them. After taking their powers and placing them in himself, he removes their collars and attempts to kill them before they recover. Shu, despite being drained of magical ability, unconsciously teleports the party to the distant Devour village.|$|E
25|$|At 6:30a.m. on April 16, {{the body}} of a 13-year-old schoolgirl named Dawn Louise Basom was found {{discarded}} beside a desolate road in Ypsilanti. Clothed only in a white blouse and bra, which had been pushed <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> she had been repeatedly stabbed in the chest and genitals, had received multiple slash wounds across the breasts, buttocks and stomach, then strangled to death with a two-foot length electrical flex still knotted <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> A handkerchief found stuffed in her mouth had likely been placed there to muffle her cries throughout her torture, and her murderer had placed her body in a location where rapid discovery was assured.|$|E

60|$|The plank {{had just}} been thrown out from the little deck. Corny made one bound.
