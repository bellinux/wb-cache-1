50|$|Even though Hrólfr Kraki {{was made}} their guardian, their mother {{could have easily}} fled back to her Wuffing kin, as the male line of Hroðgar seemed to live on through Valdar. Valdar also took power in Scane, which makes sense as it is near Östergötland. After Ingjald's death, Sögubrot relates, Ivar Vidfamne gave the East Geatish throne to Hjörmund, the son of Hjörvard, since {{it had been the}} kingdom of Hjörmund's father Hjörvard. As Ivar Vidfamne was a great {{grandson}} of Hroðgar and his Wuffing wife Wealhþēow, this could be seen as a reward for loyalty as well <b>as</b> <b>kinship</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wuffings.|$|E

25|$|This {{changed when}} Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb and the Icelandic grammarian and {{politician}} Jón Sigurðsson published a written standard for Modern Faroese in 1854, which still exists.
