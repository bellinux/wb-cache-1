5|$|In most countries, winter service {{vehicles}} usually have <b>amber</b> <b>light</b> bars, which are activated {{to indicate that}} the vehicle is operating below the local speed limit or otherwise poses a danger to other traffic, either by straddling lanes or by spreading grit or de-icer. In some areas, such as the Canadian province of Ontario, winter {{service vehicles}} use the blue flashing lights associated with emergency service vehicles, rather than the amber or orange used elsewhere. Many agencies also paint their vehicles in high-contrast orange or yellow to allow the vehicles to be seen more clearly in whiteout conditions.|$|E
25|$|Irish level {{crossings}} (crosaire comhréidh in Irish) {{are similar to}} UK {{level crossings}}, {{in the fact that}} they have a preliminary <b>amber</b> <b>light</b> before the red lights start flashing and the barriers descend (one example at Wexford does not have an <b>amber</b> <b>light).</b> Crossings are the same on the whole island of Ireland, and are either of the old gated variant, or are automatic. Ireland does have automatic crossings that have full barriers, which are not seen in the UK. The audible alarms are unique to the country.|$|E
25|$|Green {{lights are}} used to denote a {{stationary}} ambulance, fire or police command motor vehicle. In Queensland it is also used on some State Forest bush fire units along with the amber. Further, in Queensland, some municipal animal control units use a green and <b>amber</b> <b>light</b> combination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amber</b> <b>lights</b> {{are used}} by {{roadside}} breakdown vehicles, Security patrol vehicles, tow trucks, road construction/repair motor vehicles and most other utility vehicles. Amber is also used by motor vehicles operating in and around airports and docks, this includes Australian Federal Police and Australian Customs vehicles which are fitted with additional <b>amber</b> <b>lighting</b> to supplement their red and blue lightbars. Queensland State Emergency Service motor vehicles are only authorized to display <b>amber</b> <b>lights</b> under certain circumstances.|$|R
2500|$|Amber: <b>Amber</b> <b>lights</b> may be {{operated}} by towing companies, traffic management agencies, construction site vehicles and heavy vehicles, or by other utility vehicles when necessary to warn other motorists of a hazard. Amber {{must also be}} fitted to oversize vehicles and their pilot vehicles. Vehicles operating in airports and sea ports must display <b>amber</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
25|$|In Ohio, snowplows {{used by the}} Ohio Department of Transportation use a {{combination}} of green and <b>amber</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
25|$|While certain {{colors are}} customarily used by {{different}} services, often other colors are optionally used, such as amber and white. Sometimes, {{this is done}} to satisfy particular regulations; for example, California requires a steady red light facing forward and a flashing <b>amber</b> <b>light</b> to the rear on every emergency vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The three {{emergency}} lights used in Romania are red, {{blue and}} amber. At a red flashing light, bringing {{the vehicle to}} a full stop is compulsory, while for a blue light yielding, slowing down and {{moving out of the}} way is compulsory, and an <b>amber</b> <b>light</b> means other traffic vehicles must proceed with caution due to an oversized or slow vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The colour {{of light}} emitted by vehicle lights is largely {{standardised}} by longstanding convention. It was first codified in the 1949 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic and later specified in the 1968 United Nations Convention on Road Traffic. Generally, but with some regional exceptions, lamps facing rearward must emit red light, lamps facing sideward and all turn signals must emit <b>amber</b> <b>light,</b> while lamps facing frontward must emit white or selective yellow light. No other colours are permitted except on emergency vehicles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amber</b> <b>lights</b> {{generally}} designate non-emergency or slow movement vehicles such as tow trucks, tractors, combine harvesters or construction equipment.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Amber</b> <b>lights</b> grant no {{priority}} in traffic and exist purely to advertise the vehicle’s presence. [...] The Regulations specifies several classes of vehicles which may use <b>amber</b> <b>lights,</b> such as towing, highway maintenance, pilot vehicles escorting an oversize load, and vehicles unable to travel over 25mph and fitting these lights to other vehicles(such as privately owned or pedestrian) is legal (these beacons are widely fitted to vehicles as wide-ranging as security and ambulances).|$|R

25|$|The front {{position}} lamps on any vehicle may emit white or <b>amber</b> <b>light</b> in the US, Canada, Mexico, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand {{and much of the}} Middle East; elsewhere in the world only motorcycles may have amber {{front position}} lamps; all other vehicles must have white ones. Colloquial city light terminology for {{front position lamps}} derives from the practice, formerly adhered to in cities like Moscow, London and Paris, of driving at night in built-up areas using these low-intensity lights rather than headlamps.|$|E
25|$|The Legacy also {{incorporates}} Subaru's side {{monitoring system}} as well. These systems include Blind Spot Alert, Lane Change Assist, and Cross-Traffic Alert System. An <b>amber</b> <b>light</b> {{is located in}} the respective side-view mirror stays steady if a vehicle is detected in the blind spot or is approaching at a fast enough pace to interfere with a lane change, or flashes with an additional audible alert if the driver is indicating a lane change or backing out of a parking spot with an object approaching.|$|E
25|$|The amber bulbs {{commonly}} used in turn signals with colourless lenses are no longer made with cadmium glass, since various regulations worldwide, including the European RoHS directive, banned cadmium because of its toxicity. Amber glass made without cadmium is relatively costly, so most amber bulbs are now made with clear glass dipped in an amber coating. Some of these coatings are not as durable as the bulb envelopes; with prolonged heat-cool cycles, the coating may flake off the bulb glass, or its colour may fade. This causes the turn signal to emit white light, rather than the required <b>amber</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
50|$|In France, a {{small number}} of {{pedestrian}} crossings are illuminated by special streetlights (lamp posts in British English) that have flashing <b>amber</b> <b>lights</b> on their sides that play the same role as Belisha Beacons.|$|R
50|$|According to Potts, {{the idea}} for red, green and <b>amber</b> <b>lights</b> was first used by railroads and his first {{automatic}} timing device at Woodward and Michigan was built from a sign flasher that cost $37.|$|R
5000|$|A {{mutation}} at {{the extension}} locus E/e (the melanocortin receptor) changes black pigment to <b>amber</b> or <b>light</b> <b>amber.</b> This phenomenon was first identified in Norwegian Forest Cats.|$|R
25|$|Until {{the early}} 1960s, most front turn signals {{worldwide}} emitted white light and most rear turn signals emitted red. The auto {{industry in the}} USA voluntarily adopted amber front-turn signals for most vehicles beginning in the 1963 model year, though the advent of amber signals was accompanied by legal stumbles in some states and front turn signals were still legally permitted to emit white light until FMVSS 108 took effect for the 1968 model year, whereupon amber became the only permissible front turn signal colour. Presently, most countries outside of the United States and Canada require that all front, side and rear turn signals produce <b>amber</b> <b>light.</b> Exceptions include Switzerland and New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Level {{crossings}} (groesfan reilffordd in Welsh, rèidh-tharsainn in Scottish Gaelic) in the United Kingdom {{started out}} as manually gated crossings opened by a signalman. These were standard all across the network until mechanised barriers started to be introduced. These could be operated by a signalman adjacent to the crossing or were automatic. After the major Hixon rail crash in 1968, the design of level crossings started to change, and all mechanised crossings {{had to have a}} preliminary <b>amber</b> <b>light</b> fitted, which makes UK level crossings one of only a few countries with this design of crossing. More recent advantages in technology have led to more technical automatic crossings, more safer open crossings, and crossings with obstacle detection systems to detect stray people or vehicles on the crossing.|$|E
25|$|These are {{required}} to produce white light by U.S. and international UN Regulations. However, some countries have at various times permitted amber reversing lights. In Australia and New Zealand, for example, vehicle manufacturers were faced {{with the task of}} localising American cars originally equipped with combination red brake/turn signal lamps and white reversing lights. Those countries' regulations permitted the amber rear turn signals to burn steadily as reversing lights, so automakers and importers were able to combine the (mandatorily amber) rear turn signal and (optionally amber) reversing light function, and so comply with the regulations without the need for additional lighting devices. Both countries presently require white reversing lights, so the combination amber turn/reverse light is no longer permitted on new vehicles. The U.S. state of Washington presently permits reversing lamps to emit white or <b>amber</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
25|$|Amber : For any {{emergency}} vehicle, <b>amber</b> <b>lights</b> can be {{used with}} or without blue, to warn other drivers the emergency vehicle is stopped or slow. Non-emergency vehicles allowed to use amber include agricultural, construction, utility, oversized, tow and airport vehicles.|$|R
25|$|<b>Amber</b> <b>lights</b> {{are often}} used on vehicle {{involved}} in non-emergency work. Most utility companies, towing services, oversize load vehicles, slow vehicles, and certain types of construction equipment mount some type of lightbar or lighting system for {{a higher degree of}} visibility.|$|R

500|$|Light {{at the red}} end of {{the visible}} {{spectrum}} has been observed to be required {{for the development of}} R.palmatus fruit bodies, contrary to the typical requirement for blue light seen with many other mushroom species. Fruiting occurs in the presence of green, yellow or red light with wavelengths above 500nm, but only when blue light (under 500nm) is absent. Consequently, phenotypic variations observed in the field—such as size, shape, and cap color—may be influenced by differing conditions of light color and intensity. For example, specimens grown in the laboratory under green light had fruit bodies with short, straight stems and pale orange, large caps with well-developed ridges and pits, an appearance similar to specimens found in the field that were growing under a canopy of green leaves. Laboratory-grown specimens under <b>amber</b> <b>light</b> had bright orange, small caps with less pronounced similarly, field specimens found in the fall, after the leaves had fallen, were more orange to orange-pink in color.|$|E
2500|$|As with livery cabs, {{there is}} an {{additional}} round <b>amber</b> <b>light</b> mounted {{on the left side}} of the trunk, as well as an <b>amber</b> <b>light</b> at the front of the cab, usually hidden from view behind the grille. When activated by the driver, these [...] "trouble lights" [...] blink to summon the police.|$|E
2500|$|In Massachusetts, Police {{vehicles}} are only permitted to display blue lights {{to the front}} of the vehicle, with white lights being optional. Police {{vehicles are}} also required to display to the rear at least one red light and one <b>amber</b> <b>light.</b> The law is inverse for fire trucks. Fire trucks are only permitted to display red lights {{to the front of}} the vehicle, but must display at least one blue and <b>amber</b> <b>light</b> to the rear. Ambulances usually follow the same scheme as fire trucks, but some ambulances can be seen with red and blue lights throughout.|$|E
5000|$|The phrase {{has been}} popularly used to succinctly {{describe}} high risk driving behaviors that enhance {{the likelihood of}} automobile collisions, damage, injury and death. [...] It characterizes amber gambling as racing through <b>amber</b> <b>lights</b> {{at one end of}} the cycle or the other.|$|R
50|$|When {{travelling}} on {{the hard}} shoulder, vehicles use front- and rear-facing <b>amber</b> <b>lighting,</b> and are restricted to 20 mph (HETO procedures). When stationary {{on the hard}} shoulder, vehicles illuminate rear-facing amber LEDs. However, when the vehicle is working in the carriageway all the rear-facing <b>lights</b> (<b>amber</b> and red) are displayed to warn approaching traffic. Traffic officers, unlike police, must comply with all speed limits, including temporary mandatory limits in roadworks.|$|R
50|$|Amber: <b>Amber</b> <b>lights</b> may be {{operated}} by towing companies, traffic management agencies, customs officers, fisheries officers, marine reserve officers or by other utility vehicles when necessary to warn other motorists of a hazard. Amber {{must also be}} fitted to oversize vehicles and their pilot vehicles.|$|R
2500|$|In France a {{right turn}} on red without {{stopping}} is allowed when a separate arrow-shaped <b>amber</b> <b>light</b> flashes, but drivers {{do not have}} priority. [...] They must check if any pedestrians are crossing before turning and must give way to vehicles coming from other directions.. In France it is allowed to turn right on red for cyclists if a sign tell so.|$|E
2500|$|The single beacon is also {{available}} with a magnetic mount for situations where permanent mounting is impractical. [...] Examples of such situations would be detectives in unmarked vehicles, volunteer firefighters, or managers at freight yards who use an <b>amber</b> <b>light</b> for safety. These ‘mag-mount’ beacons are often round or teardrop-shaped, and are {{often referred to as}} ‘Kojak’ lights after the popular 1970s TV detective who used one.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{crossings}} in {{the country}} now are composed of lights, alarms and full, half or no barriers. The lights are unique in {{that they have a}} preliminary <b>amber</b> <b>light</b> accompanied by two red lights. The alarms come in a range of tones, and can be composed of a speaking warning saying [...] "warning: another train is approaching". Many crossings are automatic, but can be manually operated or by CCTV or obstacle detection. There are some gated crossings still left {{in the country}}, as well as some open crossings with no lights, barriers or alarms. There are various classifications for crossings in the UK.|$|E
