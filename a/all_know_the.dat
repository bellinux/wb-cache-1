Indeed, it was hard to blame the prison officer who observed that he thought it was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, of course, we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, as somebody observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E

Arriving in Fortuna, Vergil sets out to investigate the Order of the Sword and their intentions. In Vergil's closing cutscene, he leaves Fortuna, presumably having gained the knowledge he was looking for, and notes that while he can't exactly call them [...] misguided, [...] "...one day they will <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> true power of a son of Sparda." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} of the I'm Breathless songs began with [...] "Sooner or Later" [...] sung atop a grand piano, followed by [...] "Hanky Panky", where Madonna {{stood in front of}} a microphone and sang it. She was dressed in a striped vaudeville-style corset, playing the part of a nightclub singer. Near the end Madonna joked: [...] "You <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> pleasures of a good spanking, don't you? [...] When I hurt people, I feel better, you know what I mean?" [...] The final song of the segment was [...] "Now I'm Following You" [...] where Madonna danced and lip-synched with dancer Salim Gauwloos, who was dressed like Dick Tracy. Regarding the [...] "shameless promotion" [...] of Dick Tracy in this segment, O'Brien said that [...] "along with her yen for artistic expression, Madonna has always had an eye on the bottom dollar... the Dick Tracy section is the least dynamic part of the show".|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. David Hinkley of The New York Daily News {{rated the}} pilot {{three out of}} five stars, stating [...] "The story and the {{chemistry}} work, but periodically the action feels rushed, as if we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> drill and {{we might as well}} get it over with. Future episodes may correct that, because they'll need less setup work." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety stated [...] "On paper, [...] "Hawaii Five-0" [...] appears destined for can't-miss success, offering a pre-sold name, an attractive cast and a stunning location," [...] but felt the millions spent on the pilot [...] "doesn't necessarily indicate smooth sailing, relying as it does on playful banter (more like frat-boy hazing) between the leads that grows tiresome even before the hour's over." [...] Ellen Gray of the Philadelphia Daily News felt it was [...] "a huge let down," [...] and was critical of the cast's performance, in particular O'Loughlin and Caan.|$|E
500|$|TV Squad's Bob Sassone {{hoped that}} the storyline {{involving}} Jack and Elisa would be over, [...] "because we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> relationship isn't going anywhere." [...] He, however, noted {{that it was not}} a [...] "bad subplot" [...] with the pairing of Kenneth and Tracy, but that his [...] "favorite part" [...] of [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] was Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) impersonation of singer Michael McDonald. James Poniewozik for Time was not a fan of Salma Hayek's character, as she was not [...] "adding much to the show." [...] Poniewozik wrote that her character in this episode was the first time she seemed to be a [...] "fully contributing part of the ensemble." [...] Jack's scene in the church, along with him once claiming he was God in a deposition—a reference to Alec Baldwin's role in the film Malice (1993)—was well received, with Canning concluding that these traits make for [...] "an instant classic Jack Donaghy moment." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hanky Panky" [...] {{was first}} {{performed}} on Madonna's third concert tour, the Blond Ambition World Tour of 1990. She performed the song {{dressed in a}} green and white striped vaudeville-style corset, playing {{the part of a}} nightclub singer, {{standing in front of a}} microphone. Near the end of the performance, Madonna joked: [...] "You <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> pleasures of a good spanking, don't you? [...] When I hurt people, I feel better, you know what I mean?". Regarding the [...] "shameless promotion" [...] of Dick Tracy in this segment, author Lucy O'Brien said that [...] "along with her yen for artistic expression, Madonna has always had an eye on the bottom dollar... the Dick Tracy section is the least dynamic part of the show". Two different performances [...] were released on video, the first was included in Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90, taped from the performance at Yokohama Stadium in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the other once included on Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped at the Stade de l'Ouest in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.|$|E

2500|$|The Telegraph {{reported}} on December 20, that Mayweather said Pacquiao’s association with promoter Bob Arum {{is the reason}} why the bout will not happen.

[...] PTV cancelled his contract stating that [...] "We are a national network and we have certain codes of conduct on what can and cannot be said on air.

2500|$|The airport {{designator}} [...] "SUX" [...] {{has been}} contentious. [...] Sioux City Mayor Craig Berenstein in 2002 described SUX as an [...] "embarrassment" [...] to the city. [...] After petitioning the FAA for a changed airport identifier in 1998 and 2002, authorities found the alternatives offered - GWU, GYO, GYT, SGV, and GAY - to be unappealing, and elected {{to stay with}} SUX. In October 2007, airport board member Dave Bernstein proposed embracing the identifier, saying [...] "Let's {{make the best of}} it. [...] I think we have the opportunity {{to turn it into a}} positive," [...] and noting [...] "I've got buddies that I went to college with in different cities that can't even remember their own birthdays, but they <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> Sioux City designator — SUX."

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1920s, as {{nationalism}} became a radical {{force on the}} Romanian political stage, issuing calls for ethnocracy, Perpessicius joined intellectuals who called for moderation. In a 1931 piece for Cuvântul, he reacted against nationalist arguments: [...] "The fashion of good Romanians is making a rather furious comeback. You <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> heresy: one claims that native inhabitants are separated into good and bad, into plagued and pleasant-smelling, less so for their intentions or actions, but rather for {{the point of view}} adopted by the esteemed censors of our public and national life. [...] And how much longer do they plan to confront us with this self-sufficient nonsense? Will the mystification never cease? Will common sense never descend among the concrete walls of the office where they forge nationality certificates? No good Romanians but just humans, just humans, gentlemen, and it would suffice." [...] Literary historian Z. Ornea, who likens this [...] "lucid-democratic" [...] text with one issued a year earlier by Viaţa Românească magazine, notes that both appeals failed to prevent the [...] "totalitarian debauchery" [...] of the subsequent decade, when the Iron Guard emerged as a force.|$|E

We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> {{flooring}} of the passages and staircases that is too new, and the walls that are too new, and the house that is haunted by the ghost of mortar. We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> doors that have cracked, and the cracked shutters through which we {{get a glimpse of}} the disconsolate moon. We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> new people, who have come to keep the new hotel, and who wish they had never come, and who (inevitable result) wish WE had never come. We all know how much too scant and smooth and bright the new furniture is, and how it has never settled down, and cannot fit itself into right places, and will get into wrong places. We all know how the gas, being lighted, shows maps of Damp upon the walls. We all know how the ghost of mortar passes into our sandwich, stirs our negus, goes up to bed with us, ascends the pale bedroom chimney, and prevents the smoke from following. We all know how a leg of our chair comes off at breakfast in the morning, and how the dejected waiter attributes the accident to a general greenness pervading the establishment, and informs us, in reply to a local inquiry, that he is thankful to say he is an entire stranger {{in that part of the}} country and is going back to his own connexion on Saturday.|$|E
