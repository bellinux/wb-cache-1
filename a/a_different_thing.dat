25|$|I think Neal {{did a lot}} of {{marvelous}} {{things for}} us, because even though what he did was <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> and not quite the style but sort of a different sound, I think it was quite musical.|$|E
25|$|Compound {{eyes are}} {{found among the}} {{arthropods}} and are composed of many simple facets which, depending {{on the details of}} anatomy, may give either a single pixelated image or multiple images, per eye. Each sensor has its own lens and photosensitive cell(s). Some eyes have up to 28,000 such sensors, which are arranged hexagonally, and which can give a full 360° field of vision. Compound eyes are very sensitive to motion. Some arthropods, including many Strepsiptera, have compound eyes of only a few facets, each with a retina capable of creating an image, creating vision. With each eye viewing <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>thing,</b> a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain, providing very different, high-resolution images.|$|E
500|$|Whitehead {{pointed to}} the {{limitations}} of language {{as one of the}} main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking, and acknowledged that {{it may be difficult to}} ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech. [...] After all, each moment of each person's life can hardly be given a different proper name, and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things, rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> from what it was a moment ago. [...] Yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that [...] "material substances" [...] or [...] "essences" [...] are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular, concrete processes. [...] No one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old, and in many ways is not the same person at all; Whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next.|$|E

500|$|The band {{spent five}} months at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, writing and {{recording}} {{what would become}} Never Say Die!. [...] "It took quite a long time", Iommi said. [...] "We were getting really drugged out, {{doing a lot of}} dope. We'd go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned, we'd have to stop. Nobody could get anything right, we were all over the place, everybody's playing <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>thing.</b> We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day." [...] The album was released in September 1978, reaching number twelve in the UK, and number 69 in the US. Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating two decades after its release that the album's [...] "unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band's tense personnel problems and drug abuse." [...] The album featured the singles [...] "Never Say Die" [...] and [...] "Hard Road", both of which cracked the top 40 in the UK. The band also made their second appearance on Top of the Pops, performing [...] "Never Say Die". It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the US.|$|E
2500|$|Wilko, said Frankfurter, had {{not been}} coerced into {{accepting}} the arbitration clause, {{as far as he}} could see. [...] "It is one thing to make out a case of overreaching as between parties bargaining not at arm's length," [...] he wrote. [...] "It is quite <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> to find in the anti-waiver provision of the Securities Act a general limitation on the Federal Arbitration Act." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reed's fans eagerly {{anticipated}} his [...] "business" [...] in {{the many}} encores that followed some of his songs, in which [...] "his antics would become ever more outrageous. ... Reed's Sir Joseph Porter would jump overboard only to re-enter clutching a rubber life-ring, while ... his Ko-Ko would be found furiously – and anachronistically – pedalling across the stage in a toy car." [...] On the other hand, he was sometimes criticised for these instances of dropping character and adding anachronisms. He explained, [...] "An encore is <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> [...] a bit of fun {{between me and the}} audience [...] then I come right back into character again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah,' {{said the}} new-comer, 'it's {{a good thing}} for both of us, isn't it? Company, you see--company--is--is--it's <b>a</b> very <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> from solitude--ain't it?' ...|$|R

2500|$|Blackman {{says that}} playing with Kravitz and playing jazz are different. [...] "My job with Lenny is <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>thing.</b> My {{job is to}} play a beat for hours, and make it feel good, and add some {{exciting}} fills and exciting colors, when it fits tastefully", Blackman says. [...] "My job in my band or in a creative situation is a totally different thing. We may start with a groove that feels great, I may play that for hours too, but I'm going to explore and expand and change that, play around with the rhythm and interject with the soloists." [...] "I like dance music and I like making the music feel good", says Blackman. [...] "To drive an audience of 100,000 into complete oblivion by playing a groove so strong ... I love doing that. I love the chance to show versatility." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Osbourne {{left the}} band {{for three months}} to pursue {{interest}} in a solo project he called Blizzard of Ozz, a name which had been suggested by his father. Three members of the band Necromandus, who had supported Black Sabbath in Birmingham when they were called Earth, did backup for Osbourne {{in the studio and}} briefly became the first incarnation of his solo band. At the request of the other members, Osbourne rejoined Sabbath. The band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, writing and recording what would become Never Say Die! [...] "It took quite a long time", Iommi said. [...] "We were getting really drugged out, doing a lot of dope. We'd go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned, we'd have to stop.

2500|$|Jackson's {{representative}} Stephen Huvane stated [...] "Personally, she’s {{not comfortable}} with being Janet in public [...] When she’s performing, that’s <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>thing.</b> We always planned that when the album came out, we would do the proper promotion." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam commented, [...] "Between albums she likes to go live life, recharge her batteries {{and be able to}} share her experiences. It not only raises her artistic level, she's able to talk about things she's going through -- and other people can relate. That's {{one of the things that}} allows her to connect truly with the fans." [...] Prior to promotion, Jackson performed a medley of [...] "All for You", [...] "Rhythm Nation", and [...] "The Knowledge" [...] at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. Surprise guest Justin Timberlake arrived to perform a duet version of [...] "Rock Your Body," [...] which ended in Jackson's breast being accidentally exposed. The incident resulted in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission enforcing massive fines on conglomerates involved with the broadcast, including CBS, Viacom, and MTV; who then blacklisted Jackson on many radio formats and music channels worldwide as a result.|$|E

2500|$|Following her divorce, Jackson {{decided to}} record an uptempo, optimistic album rather than songs about sadness or anger. Producer Jimmy Jam said, [...] "You {{go through all}} these {{emotions}} and then {{you come out of}} it {{on the other side and}} say, [...] "I'm going to be okay and I have a lot of things to be thankful for,' and that was the overriding feeling in her life when we were making this album." [...] Its concept focuses largely on the demise of her marriage to René Elizondo, Jr. and subsequent embrace of the single life, experiencing dating for the first time. It also contains themes of sensuality, deceit, and betrayal. Jackson said, [...] "It’s <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> for me. Growing up, I never dated. I’m doing that now, experiencing that whole life." [...] Its upbeat tempo intended to reflect Jackson's self-esteem, described as [...] "a work in progress." [...] Jam commented, [...] "She doesn't see herself the way other people see her. You know...gorgeous and sexy and all that. That isn't the kind of person she is. Although she is closer to feeling like that person now than she was 15 years ago. Or even three of four years ago." [...] Jackson commented, [...] "I look back at pictures of myself from four years ago and I see the unhappiness in my eyes. But I'm in the greatest space now... I believe we have choices and paths, and it's about choosing the right path, the promising path." [...] While recording, Jackson listened to artists such as St. Germain, Buena Vista Social Club, Thievery Corporation, Basement Jaxx, Outkast and Papa Roach.|$|E
