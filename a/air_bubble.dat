Hydrophilidae have hairs on their under surface that retain {{a layer of}} air against their bodies. Adult crawling water beetles use both their elytra and their hind coxae (the basal segment of the back legs) in air retention, while whirligig beetles simply carry an <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> down with them whenever they dive.|$|E

40|$|Defects such as <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> in {{membranes}} {{have been}} shown to arise during manufacturing. These defects can lead to premature degradation or failure in applications such as fuel cells. In this numerical study, a non-isothermal two-phase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is created to investigate the behavior of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> entrained in polyphosphoric acid doped polybenzimi-dazole (PPA/PBI) membrane solution during casting as it progresses through membrane solidification. The enthalpy-porosity method is used in the CFD model to simulate the solidification process. It is shown that initially the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> are semi-circular. However, as the PPA/PBI solution solidifies and passes through the mushy zone, the shape of the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> change to semi-elliptical. Hence, it is found that the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> will not diffuse but rather remain in the membrane post solidification...|$|R

40|$|Ancient {{atmospheric}} gases {{are trapped in}} polar ice sheets. The gas molecules are stored in <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> at shallower depth. The <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> are gradually compressed with depth and begin to transform into clathrate hydrates below a level at which the hydrostatic pressure becomes greater than the formation pressure of the phase of air clathrate hydrate. <b>Air</b> <b>bubbles</b> and clathrate hydrates coexist in the deep ice {{over a long period}} of time. Significant gas fractionations during the transition process have been found from measurements of the depth profile of the N 2 /O 2 composition ratios in clathrate hydrates and <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> in the Dome-Fuji ice and the Vostok ice. Analyzing the molecular diffusion process in ice, the gas fractionation is attributed to a larger mass flux of O 2 molecules from <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> to clathrate hydrates through the ice matrix than that of N 2. We review the process of gas fractionation caused by the formation of clathrate hydrates in polar ice sheets...|$|R

40|$|Spherical or {{spheroidal}} <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> {{are generally}} {{trapped in the}} formation of rapidly growing ice crystals. In this study the single-scattering properties of inhomogeneous ice crystals containing <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> are investigated. Specifically, a computational model based on an improved geometric-optics method (IGOM) has been developed to simulate the scattering of light by randomly oriented hexagonal ice crystals containing spherical or spheroidal <b>air</b> <b>bubbles.</b> A combination of the ray-tracing technique and the Monte Carlo method is used. The effect of the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> within ice crystals is to smooth the phase functions, diminish the 22 deg and 46 deg halo peaks, and substantially reduce the backscatter relative to bubble-free particles. These features vary with the number, sizes, locations and shapes of the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> within ice crystals. Moreover, the asymmetry factors of inhomogeneous ice crystals decrease as the volume of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> increases. Cloud reflectance lookup tables were generated at wavelengths 0. 65 m and 2. 13 m with different air-bubble conditions to examine the impact of the bubbles on retrieving ice cloud optical thickness and effective particle size. The reflectances simulated for inhomogeneous ice crystals are slightly larger than those computed for homogenous ice crystals at a wavelength of 0. 65 microns. Thus, the retrieved cloud optical thicknesses are reduced by employing inhomogeneous ice cloud models. At a wavelength of 2. 13 microns, including <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> in ice cloud models may also increase the reflectance. This effect implies that the retrieved effective particle sizes for inhomogeneous ice crystals are larger than those retrieved for homogeneous ice crystals, particularly, in the case of large <b>air</b> <b>bubbles...</b>|$|R
25|$|The large mass of rock, {{acted as}} a {{monolith}} (thus resembling high-angle asteroid impact), struck with great force the sediments at bottom of Gilbert Inlet {{at the head of}} the bay. The impact created a large crater and displaced and folded recent and Tertiary deposits and sedimentary layers to an unknown depth. The displaced water and the displacement and folding of the sediments broke and uplifted 1,300 feet of ice along the entire front of the Lituya Glacier at the north end of Gilbert Inlet. Also, the impact and the sediment displacement by the rockfall resulted in an <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> and in water splashing action that reached the 1,720 foot (524 m.) elevation on the other side of the head of Gilbert Inlet. The same rockfall impact, in combination with the strong ground movements, the net vertical crustal uplift of about 3.5 feet, and an overall tilting seaward of the entire crustal block on which Lituya Bay was situated, generated the giant solitary gravity wave which swept the main body of the bay.|$|E
25|$|The {{nervous system}} in beetles {{contains}} all the types found in insects, varying between different species. With three thoracic and {{seven or eight}} abdominal ganglia can be distinguished to that {{in which all the}} thoracic and abdominal ganglia are fused to form a composite structure. Oxygen is obtained via a tracheal system. Air enters a series of tubes along the body through openings called spiracles, and is then taken into increasingly finer fibers. Pumping movements of the body force the air through the system. Some species of diving beetles (Dytiscidae) carry a bubble of air with them whenever they dive beneath the water surface. This bubble may be held under the elytra or it may be trapped against the body using specialized hairs. The bubble usually covers one or more spiracles so the insect can breathe air from the bubble while submerged. An <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> provides an insect with only a short-term supply of oxygen, but thanks to its unique physical properties, oxygen will diffuse into the bubble and displacing the nitrogen, called passive diffusion, however the volume of the bubble eventually diminishes and the beetle will have to return to the surface.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} load a gas as {{a sample of}} {{pressure}} transmitting medium, the gas must be in a dense state, as to not shrink the sample chamber once pressure is induced. To achieve a dense state, gases can be liquefied at low temperatures or compressed. Cryogenic loading is a technique that uses liquefied gas {{as a means of}} filling the sample chamber. The DAC is directly immersed into the cryogenic fluid that fills the sample chamber. However, there are disadvantages to cryogenic loading. With the low temperatures indicative of cryogenic loading, the sample is subjected to temperatures that could irreversibly change it. Also, the boiling liquid could displace the sample or trap an <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> in the chamber. It is not possible to load gas mixtures using the cryogenic method due to the different boiling points of most gases. Gas compression technique densifys the gases at room temperature. With this method, most of the problems seen with cryogenic loading are fixed. Also, loading gas mixtures becomes a possibility. The technique uses a vessel or chamber in which the DAC is placed and is filled with gas. Gases are pressurized and pumped into the vessel with a compressor. Once the vessel is filled and the desired pressure is reached the DAC is closed with a clamp system run by motor driven screws.|$|E
40|$|Aim: We aim to {{evaluate}} {{the effect of the}} movement of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> after embryo transfer (ET) on pregnancy outcomes under transabdominal ultrasound-guided ET in IVF cycles. Material and Method: One hundred and thirty six (136) ultrasound-guided fresh fundal ETs included in this study were divided into 3 groups according to the movement of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> after ET. Group 1 (n= 101) consisted of ETs in which the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> moved towards the uterine fundus with ejection immediately after transfer; Group 2 (n= 5) consisted of ETs in which the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> moved towards the cervical canal after transfer; Group 3 (n= 30) consisted of ETs in which no movement of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> was observed after transfer. The primary outcome was the clinical pregnancy rate. Results: Of all the transfers, 53 (38. 9 %) resulted in a clinical pregnancy. Of these clinical pregnancies, 75 % was in group 1, 1. 9 % was in group 2 and 22. 6 % was in group 3. The clinical pregnancy rates were 39. 6 %, 20 %, and 40 % in groups 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The clinical pregnancy rates were dramatically reduced in cases with the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> moving towards the cervical canal after transfer, although this did not reach statistical significance (p= 0. 67). Discussion: The movement of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> towards the cervical canal after transfer can reflect a poor prognostic outcome in terms of lower pregnancy rates and can influence the success of IVF treatment...|$|R

2500|$|Most wine racks are {{designed}} to allow a wine to be stored on its side. The thinking behind this orientation is that the cork {{is more likely to}} stay moist and not dry out if it is kept in constant contact with the wine. Some wineries package their wines upside down in the box for much the same reason. Research in the late 1990s suggested that the ideal orientation for wine bottles is at a slight angle, rather than completely horizontal. This allows the cork to maintain partial contact with the wine in order to stay damp but also keeps the <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> formed by a wine's ullage at the top rather than {{in the middle of the}} bottle if the wine is lying on its side. Keeping the ullage near the top, it has been argued, allows for a slower and more gradual oxidation and maturation process. This is because the pressure of the <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> that is the ullage space rises and falls depending on temperature fluctuation. When exposed to higher temperatures the bubble's pressure increases (becomes positive relative to the air outside of the bottle), and if the wine is tilted at an angle, this compressed gas will diffuse through the cork and not harm the wine. [...] When the temperature falls the process reverses. [...] If the wine is completely on its side then this action will eject some wine through the cork. Through this [...] "breathing" [...] which can result from variations in temperature, oxygen may be repeatedly introduced into the bottle and as a result, can react with the wine. [...] An appropriate and constant temperature is therefore preferred. Additionally, oxidation will occur more rapidly at higher temperatures and gases dissolve into liquids faster the lower the temperature.|$|E
