40|$|Keywords: Today’s {{power grid}} depends on {{embedded}} control systems to function properly. Securing these systems presents a unique challenge, since {{on top of}} the resource restrictions inherent to embedded devices, SCADA systems must accommodate strict timing requirements that are nonnegotiable, and their massive scale greatly amplifies costs such as power consumption. Together, these constraints make the conventional approach to host intrusion detection—namely, using a hypervisor to create a safe environment from which a monitoring entity can operate—too costly or impractical for embedded control systems in such critical infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce <b>Autoscopy,</b> an experimental host intrusion detection mechanism that operates from within the kernel and leverages its built-in tracing framework to look for control-flow anomalies, which are most often caused by rootkits hijacking kernel hooks. In initial testing on a standard laptop system, our prototype was able to detect a representative selection of control-flow hijacking rootkit techniques while imposing less than 5 % performance overhead for the majority of our benchmark tests. We argue that its design and effectiveness make it both feasible for and uniquely suited to intrusion detection for SCADA systems, and are currently porting <b>Autoscopy</b> to actual power hardware to test our hypothesis. Being situated in the kernel, <b>Autoscopy</b> needs some hardware (e. g., memory immutability) or software protection (i. e., kernel hardening) measures in place for its own protection; however, such protective measures would cost less than full-blown reference monitor isolation via hardware virtualization at the core of hypervisor-based proposals.

40|$|Background: Autoscopic {{phenomena}} are psychic illusory visual experiences {{consisting of}} {{the perception of the}} image of one’s own body or face within space, either from an internal point of view, as in a mirror or from an external point of view. Descriptions based on phenomenological criteria distinguish six types of autoscopic experiences: autoscopic hallucination, he-autoscopy or heautoscopic proper, feeling of a presence, out of body experience, negative and inner forms of <b>autoscopy.</b> Methods and results: We report a case of a patient with he-autoscopic seizures. EEG recordings during the autoscopic experience showed a right parietal epileptic focus. This finding confirms the involvement of the temporo-parietal junction in the abnormal body perception during autoscopic phenomena.

40|$|This {{research}} has {{its focus on}} the initial reflective training of a student of a degree course for Chemistry Teachers, during the microteaching activities, developed in the discipline of Supervised Internship. For {{the implementation of the}} proposal we integrated the phases of the microteaching to the stages of <b>autoscopy,</b> proposing the biphasic <b>autoscopy,</b> procedure performed to the data collect and to the reflexive intervention with the students. It was developed in two phases, interactive and post-active. In this context, the objective of the research consisted in characterizing how students give meaning to their thoughts and how these can interfere on the construction of their teaching profiles. The results got come from the analysis, interpretation and systematization of the data from the reflective "moments” described by Schön. Based on the analysis of the reflections we identified four "moments" of alert in the reflective student practice, however, we found that the alert 1, concerning the difficulty found by her on the approach of the content was responsible for the occurrence of other alerts along her microteaching. Thus, we infer that the alert 1 featured a situation/element of surprise that she did not framed along the lines of what she has learned to treat as normal, so it was necessary to establish a reflexive dialogue with the educative situation to set up such a problem through an answer that was not ordinary and spontaneous. In this situation, while restructuring her strategies of actions, the student acknowledged the problems arising from the teaching practice, from her difficulty in how to approach the content. Through the analyzes carried out we recognized the potentialities of integrating to the microteaching the <b>autoscopy,</b> as a way of enabling reflective moments related to the teaching practice on the training of future teachers...|$|E

40|$|Kafka's {{writings}} {{are frequently}} interpreted as representing the historical period of modernism {{in which he}} was writing. Little attention has been paid, however, to the possibility that his writings may reflect neural mechanisms in the processing of self during hypnagogic (i. e., between waking and sleep) states. Kafka suffered from dream-like, hypnagogic hallucinations during a sleep-deprived state while writing. This paper discusses reasons (phenomenological and neurobiological) why the self projects an imaginary double (<b>autoscopy)</b> in its spontaneous hallucinations and how Kafka's writings help to elucidate the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms. I further discuss how the proposed mechanisms may be relevant to understanding paranoid delusions in schizophrenia. Literature documents and records cognitive and neural processes of self with an intimacy that may be otherwise unavailable to neuroscience. To elucidate this approach, I contrast it with the apparently popularizing view that the symptoms of schizophrenia result from what has been called an operative (i. e., pre-reflective) hyper-reflexivity. The latter approach claims that pre-reflective self-awareness (diminished in schizophrenia) pervades all conscious experience (however, in a manner that remains unverifiable for both phenomenological and experimental methods). This contribution argues the opposite: the "self" informs our hypnagogic imagery precisely {{to the extent that we}} are not self-aware...|$|E

Sob esta perspectiva, a presente pesquisa tem por objetivo descrever e analisar as dimensões afetivas identificadas nas decisões do {{professor}} quanto às suas atividades de ensino, no cotidiano da sala de aula, durante o processo de aquisição da escrita pelas crianças. Busca analisar os aspectos afetivos presentes nas atividades de ensino da escrita e suas contribuições para a construção do conhecimento. Para tanto, foram utilizados procedimentos de observação das atividades em sala de aula e de entrevistas com os alunos e os professores participantes, cujos dados foram registrados através de fitas de áudio, de vídeo e pelo diário de campo. Na seqüência, os dados foram selecionados e transcritos e, em seguida, utilizando-se o procedimento de autoscopia, os alunos foram entrevistados. Posteriormente, a partir dos dados provenientes das observações vídeo-gravadas, das sessões de autoscopia e dos registros em diário de campo foram construídos núcleos temáticos, de forma a identificar as dimensões afetivas presentes nas atividades de ensino desenvolvidas pelo professor. Os núcleos temáticos demonstram que as dimensões afetivas referem-se aos materiais culturais utilizados, à presença da professora, ao fazer coletivo, às formas de ensinar da professora e à diversidade das atividades de ensino em sala de aulaBased on {{the ideas}} of Wallon and Vygotsky, {{it is possible to}} estimate that affectivity and intelligence, interrelated, become determinate factors for the individual development, acting in the learning process, favoring the interaction between subject (student) and object (school subjects). Under this perspective, the present research has as objective to describe and analyze the affective dimensions identified in the decisions of the teacher about the teaching activities, on the daily life of the classroom, during the process of literacy acquisition by the children. This research aims to analyze the affective aspects present in the literacy teaching activities and their contributions for the construction of the knowledge. During the research, observations of the teaching activities in the classroom and interviews with the teacher and students were done, whose data were registered in audio and video cassettes and in the field diary.

40|$|During an out‐of‐body {{experience}} (OBE), the experient {{seems to}} be awake and to see his body and the world from a location outside the physical body. A closely related experience is <b>autoscopy</b> (AS), which {{is characterized by the}} experience of seeing one's body in extrapersonal space. Yet, despite great public interest and many case studies, systematic neurological studies of OBE and AS are extremely rare and, to date, no testable neuroscientific theory exists. The present study describes phenomenological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging correlates of OBE and AS in six neurological patients. We provide neurological evidence that both experiences share important central mechanisms. We show that OBE and AS are frequently associated with pathological sensations of position, movement and perceived completeness of one's own body. These include vestibular sensations (such as floating, flying, elevation and rotation), visual body‐part illusions (such as the illusory shortening, transformation or movement of an extremity) and the experience of seeing one's body only partially during an OBE or AS. We also find that the patient's body position prior to the experience influences OBE and AS. Finally, in five patients, brain damage or brain dysfunction is localized to the temporo‐parietal junction (TPJ). These results suggest that the complex experiences of OBE and AS represent paroxysmal disorders of body perception and cognition (or body schema). The processes of body perception and cognition, and the unconscious creation of central representation(s) of one's own body based on proprioceptive, tactile, visual and vestibular information—as well as their integration with sensory information of extrapersonal space—is a prerequisite for rapid and effective action with our surroundings. Based on our findings, we speculate that ambiguous input from these different sensory systems is an important mechanism of OBE and AS, and thus the intriguing experience of seeing one's body in a position that does not coincide with its felt position. We suggest that OBE and AS are related to a failure to integrate proprioceptive, tactile and visual information with respect to one's own body (disintegration in personal space) and by a vestibular dysfunction leading to an additional disintegration between personal (vestibular) space and extrapersonal (visual) space. We argue that both disintegrations (personal; personal-extrapersonal) are necessary for the occurrence of OBE and AS, and that they are due to a paroxysmal cerebral dysfunction of the TPJ in a state of partially and briefly impaired consciousnes...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Misidentification {{phenomena}} and Capgras Sym- drome (CS) occur in different psychiatric (psychotic or ma- jor affective illnesses) and neurological (traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, neurosyphilis, delirium, migraine, multiple sclerosis,arteriovenous malformation, tumor, stroke and dementia) disor- ders [1]. Patients with CS report {{that one or}} more well-known persons (usually familiy members) or even the patient himself {{have been replaced by}} a “double” or impostor. This core symp- tomatology may occur within nihilistic delusions of Cotard’s Syn- drome (the delusional perceptions of physical transformation or of not being alive) and can be accompanied by intermetamorphosis, <b>autoscopy,</b> heautoscopy, depersonalization and derealization as well as by erotomanic or jealousy delusions [2]. The aim of this report is to redefine dissociative spectrum dimensions inside CS and misidentification syndromes in patients with Bipolar Disorder (BD). Method: Five inpatients presenting with BD and CS were assessed with the SCID-P for Axis I diagnosis. As regards psy- chopathological evaluation, the patients were also administered the Structured Clinical Interview for Derealization and Depersonaliza- tion Spectrum (SCI-DER), the Depersonalization Severity Scale (DSS) for dissociative spectrum symptoms, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) to quantify depressive features as well as the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) to measure manic symptoms. The SCI-DER was developed at the Departments of Psychiatry, Neurobiology, Pharmacology, and Biotechnologies of the University of Pisa by experienced psychiatrists. It includes 49 items exploring “presence” or “absence” of lifetime spontaneous symptoms of DP organized into four domains: (1) Derealization, (2) Somatopsychic depersonalization, (3) Autopsychic depersonal- ization, and (4) Affective depersonalization. All patients received a neurological and general medicine review as well as a first-level brain imaging examination (CT and/or MRI). We conducted a systematic literature review with the principal scientific databases (PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo) using the key terms “Capgras Syndrome” and “Misidentificaition”. Discussion and Conclusion: To our knowledge in the literature there are no studies that evaluated dissociative spectrum symptoms in CS in BD. Our findings suggest that autopsychic and affective depersonalization are the effective dissociative dimensions when CS or misidentification phenomena occur within type-I BD. Disso- ciation and self-concept clarity were strongly correlated providing evidence that they may form a unitary underlying concept of ‘self- concept integration’. This particular condition of identity and self fragmentation, as well as reduction of self clarity, could be the key to shedding light on the interconnection between affective and nonaffective psychotic disorders from schizophrenia to BD, and may underscore the possible validity of the concept of the unitary psychosis (Einheitpsychose) proposed by Griesinger [3 − 5]. Fur- ther research is warranted to replicate our clinical and qualitative observations and, in general, quantitative studies in large samples followed up over time are needed. Methodological limitations, clinical implications and suggestions for future research directions are considered. References [1] Fishbain D. A., 1987.

The fact of {{understanding that the}} appropriation of the written language implies overcoming pedagogical practices that focus on memorization and repetition of letters and syllables is essential knowledge for teachers to promote rapprochement between {{the children and the}} writing culture in preschool. The Historical-Cultural Theory shows that writing is a complex cultural instrument. For a person to take ownership of such writing, it is necessary that there are activities with meaning and direction, in which the use of writing by and with children happen according to the purpose for which this language was created. The Early Childhood Education is responsible for forming the basis for the appropriation of writing. Its prerogative is not to literate the children. With the aim of reflecting on the role of teachers and their pedagogical practices in the written language appropriation process by a child in the preschool ? considering the assumptions of historical-cultural approach ? we have developed a research involving four preschool teachers, specifically for children of five years of age, from a local public preschool in the city of Manaus. The methodology was based both on interviews with the four teachers {{at the same time and}} on the observation of one of the classrooms ? the information about this one was collected in a specific notebook, and was also registered by photos and short footages; there was even an <b>autoscopy</b> sessions with the teacher of the observed classroom. Through the collected information, one could notice that, when it comes to writing, the implicit concepts in the activities proposed by the teachers to children have not yet incorporated the understanding that this language is developed by practices that enrich the experiences with the culture and the possibilities of expression of the child by the acts of drawing, playing or practicing productive activities, as well as the contact with the culture surrounding the writing, which is converted into different genres of the speech. It was also possible to notice that the specific ways of learning of the young children have not been considered when the activities are planned at school. This is an essential aspect to be introduced in the initial and continued education of teachers, who are privileged object of investigation of research field training and practice of educators, considering the challenges faced in the Amazon region, to which this research is linked. This research has also shown that the act of providing time and space for theoretical reflection about pedagogical practice promotes the expansion of teachers' reflections on their doings, and it is the first step to provide changes on the writing proposals made to children...|$|E
