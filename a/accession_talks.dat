5|$|NATO {{provides}} feedback {{as well as}} {{technical advice}} to each country and evaluates its progress on an individual basis. Once a country is agreed to meet the requirements, NATO can issue that country an invitation to begin <b>accession</b> <b>talks.</b> Currently, two countries have a Membership Action Plan: Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia.. Former MAP participants were Albania and Croatia between May 2002 and April 2009, and Montenegro between December 2009 and June 2017, when they joined NATO. The final accession process, once invited, involves five steps {{leading up to the}} signing of the accession protocols and the acceptance and ratification of those protocols by the governments of the current NATO members.|$|E

25|$|In September 2017, Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, {{mentioned}} that halting <b>accession</b> <b>talks</b> with Turkey {{would be a}} strategic mistake by the European Union, amid a war of words raging between Germany and Turkey. Also, former Greek Prime Minister, George Papandreou, has urged European Union leaders to keep the doors open to Turkey and to continue dialogue with the Turkish government, in an apparent reference to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s calls for the suspension of <b>accession</b> <b>talks</b> with Turkey.|$|E
40|$|Albania {{will hold}} a {{parliamentary}} election on 25 June. The election was originally scheduled for 18 June, but was pushed back seven days following a prolonged political crisis. Andi Hoxhaj previews the vote, highlighting that while the country has made substantial improvements with respect to socio-economic reforms, its lack of political stability has held back attempts to pursue closer integration with the EU. The election will be a key moment in demonstrating to the EU that Albania {{has the potential to}} open <b>accession</b> <b>talk...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The President of the Council, Nebojsa Jovic, {{said that}} 50,000 Serbs living in North Kosovo want the {{territory}} {{to become part}} of Serbia and are ready to die for the cause. He stressed that Serbs would never accept the independence proclamation by Republic of Kosovo: [...] "They cannot force us {{to be part of the}} independent Kosovo. This will never happen, There are two options. The first is that we are allowed to live inside Serbia, separated from independent Kosovo. The second is that someone expells us from here, which believe me, is hard to achieve. Deporting 50,000 people looks like a big risk,". Commenting on EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule's urging of Belgrade to improve its relation with Pristina in order to begin EU <b>accession</b> <b>talk,</b> Jovic said that Fule [...] "means absolutely nothing compared with Resolution 1244. This resolution is stronger than Stefan Fule, and it is more powerful than the German Chancellor Merkel and other statesmen." [...] He also said [...] "What's happening in the north is a private war of Prime Minister Hashim Thaci," [...] and [...] "It’s not a war between the Albanian and Serbian nation ... No one can force us love each other, The Albanians don't love us and I don’t like them, but don’t hate them either" [...] stressing that multi-ethnic institutions could not function in Kosovo. He added: [...] "It’s a fact that in the past we Serbs tried through violence and war to achieve our goals, but we failed. That was the case pre-1999 and afterwards. Now is the time to talk to each other. Dialogue and an agreement should be based upon reality the ground and on the readiness of both sides to compromise".|$|R
25|$|Turkey’s {{refusal to}} {{implement}} a trade pact between Turkey and the EU that requires the Turkish government to allow Greek Cypriot vessels to use its air and sea ports has prompted the EU to freeze eight chapters in Turkey's <b>accession</b> <b>talks.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2006 EU sources criticised the country's {{leadership}} under {{prime minister}} Nikola Gruevski for its policies against its Albanian minority and the politicisation of many state institutions, warning that these problems might become obstacles {{to the official}} start of <b>accession</b> <b>talks.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 20 June 2013, in {{the wake}} of Ankara's {{crackdown}} on mass demonstrations in Taksim Square, Germany blocked the start to new EU <b>accession</b> <b>talks</b> with Turkey. According to the Financial Times, one Turkish official said that such a move could potentially break off political relations with the bloc.|$|E
25|$|Most {{members were}} former ministers {{with links to}} the Union, for example being Foreign Minister, Minister for European Affairs or {{represented}} their country in <b>accession</b> <b>talks</b> or at the European Convention. In addition to Barroso both Siim Kallas and Vladimír Špidla were former Prime Ministers. Viviane Reding was the only Commissioner with a background in the European Parliament.|$|E
25|$|The reformist {{course of}} Dzurinda's {{policies}} {{was confirmed by}} a mandate he was given by electors in the 2002 general election to form his second government. It was also a year when the NATO Prague Summit in November decided on Slovakia's invitation to join NATO; and the country also completed <b>accession</b> <b>talks</b> with the EU at the Copenhagen Summit in December, thus launching its ratification process.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009, the European Parliament {{expressed}} {{support for}} the Republic of Macedonia's EU candidacy and asked the EU to grant the country a date {{for the start of}} <b>accession</b> <b>talks</b> by the end of 2009, regretting that the country is waiting three years after the country was granted a candidate status, which makes a demoralizing effect on Macedonia and brings risks of destabilizing the whole region. The parliament also recommended a speedy lifting of the visa regime for the country citizens.|$|E
25|$|Turkey's <b>accession</b> <b>talks</b> {{have since}} been stalled {{by a number of}} {{domestic}} and external problems. Both Austria and France have said they would hold a referendum on Turkey's accession. In the case of France, a change in its Constitution was made to impose such a referendum, but later another constitutional change has enabled the parliament (if a large majority of its members agrees) to prevent such a referendum. The issue of Cyprus continues to be a major obstacle to negotiations. European officials have commented on the slowdown in Turkish reforms which, combined with the Cyprus problem, led the EU’s Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn in March 2007 to warn of an impending ‘train crash’ in the negotiations. Due to these setbacks, negotiations again came to a halt in December 2006, with the EU freezing talks in 8 of the 35 key areas under negotiation.|$|E
25|$|On 14 April 1987, Turkey {{submitted}} {{its application}} for formal membership into the European Economic Community. The European Commission responded in December 1989 by confirming Ankara’s eventual membership {{but also by}} deferring the matter to more favourable times, citing Turkey’s economic and political situation, as well its poor relations with Greece and the conflict with Cyprus as creating an unfavourable environment with which to begin negotiations. This position was confirmed again in the Luxembourg European Council of 1997 in which <b>accession</b> <b>talks</b> were started with central and eastern European states and Cyprus, but not Turkey. During the 1990s, Turkey proceeded with a closer integration with the European Union by agreeing to a customs union in 1995. Moreover, the Helsinki European Council of 1999 proved a milestone as the EU recognised Turkey as a candidate on equal footing with other potential candidates.|$|E

2500|$|Turkish <b>{{accession}}</b> <b>talks</b> {{came to a}} halt as {{a result}} of the 2016–17 purges in Turkey. On 24 November 2016 the European Parliament voted to suspend accession negotiations with Turkey over human rights and rule of law concerns, though this decision was not binding. On 13 December, the Council of the European Union (comprising the ministers of the member states) resolved that it would open no new areas in Turkey's membership talks in the [...] "prevailing circumstances", as Turkey’s path toward autocratic rule made progress on EU accession impossible. As of 2017, and especially following the passage of the constitutional referendum, Turkish <b>accession</b> <b>talks</b> have effectively stopped.|$|E
2500|$|In a TV {{debate in}} September 2017, German {{chancellor}} Angela Merkel and her challenger Martin Schulz both {{said that they}} would seek an end to Turkey’s membership talks with the European Union. By that time, the <b>accession</b> <b>talks</b> had ground to a virtual halt and EU leaders had stepped up their criticism of Erdogan.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso {{said that}} Turkey {{is not ready}} to join the EU [...] "tomorrow nor the day after tomorrow", but its {{membership}} negotiations should continue. He also called on France and other member states to honour the decision to continue <b>accession</b> <b>talks,</b> describing it as a matter of credibility for the Union.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 March 2008 in New York, Matthew Nimetz {{announced}} that the talks had failed, {{that there was a}} [...] "gap" [...] in the positions of the two countries, and that there would not be any progress, unless there were some sort of compromise, which he characterised as [...] "valuable" [...] for both sides. After Greek PM Karamanlis's warnings that [...] "no solution equals no invitation", the Greek media took it for granted that Greece would veto the coming NATO <b>accession</b> <b>talks</b> for the country, in the Foreign Ministers' summit on 6 March 2008 in Brussels.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, in a newer poll in Greece, the [...] "composite {{name that}} {{includes}} the name Macedonia for the country" [...] seemed, for the first time, to be marginally more popular than the previous more hard-lined stance of [...] "no Macedonia in the title" [...] (43% vs 42%). In the same poll, 84% {{of the respondents were}} pro-veto in the country's NATO <b>accession</b> <b>talks,</b> if the issue had not been resolved by then. All Greek political parties except the small nationalist party Popular Orthodox Rally support the [...] "composite name for all uses" [...] solution, and are vehemently opposed to any [...] "double name" [...] formula which is proposed by the republic. This shift in the official and public position was described by the PM of Greece as [...] "the maximum recoil possible".|$|E
2500|$|Croatia {{applied for}} EU {{membership}} in 2003, and the European Commission recommended {{making it an}} official candidate in early 2004. Candidate country status was granted to Croatia by the European Council (the EU's heads of state and/or government) in mid-2004, but the date {{for the beginning of}} entry negotiations, while originally set for March 2005, was put off. In early March 2005, Croatia was formally warned by the EU that its failure to arrest the war crimes suspect Ante Gotovina would jeopardise the country's chances of starting the <b>accession</b> <b>talks,</b> in spite of Croatia insisting it was doing everything it could to find and arrest the fugitive and claiming that Gotovina was no longer in Croatia. In fact, the talks started in October 2005, shortly before Gotovina's arrest, which occurred in early December that year and was hailed by the EU as an important turning point for the whole region, as it turned [...] "the page from the nationalist past to a European future".|$|E
50|$|In March 2009, the European Parliament {{expressed}} {{support for}} Macedonia's EU candidacy and asked the EU Commission to grant the country a date {{for the start of}} <b>accession</b> <b>talks</b> by the end of 2009. The parliament also recommended a speedy lifting of the visa regime for Macedonian citizens. However, Macedonia has so far failed to receive a start date for <b>accession</b> <b>talks</b> {{as a result of the}} naming dispute. The EU's stance is similar to NATO's in that resolution of the naming dispute is a precondition for the start of <b>accession</b> <b>talks.</b>|$|E
