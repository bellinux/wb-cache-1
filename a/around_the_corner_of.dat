25|$|Bridgeport's {{early years}} {{were marked by}} residents' {{reliance}} on fishing and farming. This {{was similar to the}} economy of the Paugusset, who had cultivated corn, beans, and squash; and fished and gathered shellfish from both the river and sound. A village called Newfield began to develop <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> State and Water streets in the 1760s. The area officially became known as Stratfield in 1695 or 1701, due to its location between the already existing towns of Stratford and Fairfield. During the American Revolution, Newfield Harbor was a center of privateering.|$|E
500|$|Some {{witnesses}} {{among the}} regulars reported {{the first shot}} was fired by a colonial onlooker from behind a hedge or <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> a tavern. Some observers reported a mounted British officer firing first. Both sides generally agreed that the initial shot {{did not come from}} the men on the ground immediately facing each other. Speculation arose later in Lexington that a man named Solomon Brown fired the first shot from inside the tavern or from behind a wall, but this has been discredited. [...] Some witnesses (on each side) claimed that someone on the other side fired first; [...] however, many more witnesses claimed to not know. [...] Yet another theory is that the first shot was one fired by the British, that killed Asahel Porter, their prisoner who was running away (he had been told to walk away and he would be let go, though he panicked and began to run). [...] Historian David Hackett Fischer has proposed that there may actually have been multiple near-simultaneous shots. [...] Historian Mark Urban claims the British surged forward with bayonets ready in an undisciplined way, provoking a few scattered shots from the militia. [...] In response the British troops, without orders, fired a devastating volley. [...] This lack of discipline among the British troops had {{a key role in the}} escalation of violence.|$|E

2500|$|It {{appears to}} connect with the more southerly {{oriented}} right-lateral Rattlesnake Mountain Fault Zone (RMFZ) straddling Rattlesnake Mountain (near North Bend), which shows a similar deep-seated contact between different kinds of basement rock. At the southern end of Rattlesnake Mountain ndash& exactly where the first lineament of the OWL is encountered ndash& at least one strand of the RMFZ (the others are hidden) turns to run by Cedar Falls and up the Cedar River. [...] Other faults to the south also show a similar turn, suggesting a general turning or bending across the OWL, yet such a bend is not apparent in the pattern of physiographic features that express the OWL. [...] With awareness that the Seattle Fault and the RMFZ are the edges of a large sheet of material which is moving north, there is a distinct impression that these faults, and even some of the topographical features, are flowing <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the Snoqualmie Valley. If it seems odd that a mountain should [...] "float" [...] around a valley: bear in mind that while the surface relief is about three-quarters of a kilometer (half a mile) in height, the material flowing could be as much as eighteen kilometers deep. [...] (The analogy of icebergs moving around a submerged sandbar is quite apt.) [...] It is worth noting that [...] ndash& a minor prominence just east of Cedar Falls ndash& is the southwestern-most exposure in the region of some very old Cretaceaous (pre-Cenozoic) metamorphic rock. It seems quite plausible that there is some well-founded and obdurate obstruction at depth, around which the shallower and younger sedimentary formations are flowing. [...] In such a context the observed arcuate fault bends would be very natural.|$|E

50|$|A woodwind growl {{can also}} be {{produced}} by allowing air to escape from <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth, causing a vibration in the lips and mouthpiece.

50|$|A {{significant}} {{example of}} the Edwardian Baroque style, the building uses a bold two tone palette of red brick and cream yellow rendered concrete. The highly articulated facade wraps <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site and displays multiple classical instances of cupolas, archways and triangular pediments that is considered by some as ‘Federation Freestyle’. These motifs also reflected a mesh of architectural styles popular in England and America at that time.|$|R
