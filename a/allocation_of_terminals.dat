In the multi-source Weber problem, the {{location}} of a fixed number of concentrators, and the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminals</b> to them, must be chosen to minimize the total cost of links between terminals and concentrators. In our variant, we have a third hierarchical level, two categories of link costs, and the number of concentrators is unknown. To solve this difficult problem, we propose several heuristics, and use a new stabilized column generation approach, based on a central cutting plane method, to provide lower bounds.

40|$|Abstract Topological {{design of}} {{centralized}} computer networks {{is an important}} problem that has been investigated by many researchers. Such networks typically involve {{a large number of}} terminals connected to concentrators, that are then connected to a central computing site. This paper focuses on the concentrator location problem among general topological network design problems. The concentrator location problem is defined as determining the following: (i) the number and locations of concentrators that are to be open, and (ii) the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminals</b> to concentrator sites without violating the capacities of concentrators. An exact algorithm (fractional cutting plane algorithmlbranch-and-bound) is proposed for solving this problem. In this approach an integer programming problem is formulated. Then a class of valid inequalities is derived and a greedy algorithm for a separation problem is shown. A good lower bound is obtained by a lifting procedures. We show how to implement the algorithm using a commercial software for LP and branch-and-bound. Finally, the computational efficiency of our algorithm is demonstrated. 1...|$|E

40|$|Standard ocean {{shipping}} contracts {{stipulate that}} a chartered vessel must sail at ‘utmost despatch’, with no {{consideration for the}} availability of berths at the destination port. The berthing policies used at many ports, which admit vessels on a first-come, first-served basis, provide an additional incentive for the master to sail at full speed. These legacy contracts and berthing policies constitute a major driver of harbour congestion and marine fuel consumption, with adverse economic, safety, and environmental consequences. We propose a methodology to evaluate {{the potential benefits of}} new berthing policies and ocean shipping contracts. Given the importance of stochasticity on the performance of maritime transport systems, and the need to represent the efficient <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminal</b> resources, we have chosen a hybrid simulation-optimization approach. Our discrete event simulation model represents vessels and their principal economic and physical characteristics, the spatial layout <b>of</b> the <b>terminal,</b> performance <b>of</b> the land-side equipment, contractual agreements and associated penalties, and berthing policies. The proposed optimization model – a substantial extension of the traditional berth assignment problem – represents the logic <b>of</b> the <b>terminal</b> planner. The simulation program solves multiple instances of the optimization model successively in order to represent the progression of planning activities at the terminal. ...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{adopt the}} two-way non-regenerative {{multicarrier}} relay scheme for indoor PLC networks with QoS considerations. In particular, {{we consider the}} joint optimization <b>of</b> the power <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> two <b>terminals</b> and the relay node to minimize the network transmission power consumption subjecting to QoS requirements, {{which has not been}} considered before. We mention that in practical PLC systems, smaller transmission power leads to lower electromagnetic interference (EMI) to other nearby communication systems. We set the QoS criteria as the lower-bounds of the capacity of the data traffic from one terminal to the other. Since this QoS-constrained power allocation problem is highly non-convex, the globally optimal solution is computationally intractable to obtain. To overcome this challenge, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) method adopted from [16] to decompose the joint optimization problem into three sub-problems. Simulation results show the fast convergence of the proposed algorithm.|$|R
40|$|Centralized {{computer}} networks are hierarchical communication infrastructures {{in which a}} central computer services {{a large number of}} terminals or workstations. For a large network, some concentrators are commonly used to increase the cost efficiency. Several terminals are connected to a concentrator via low capacity lines, and each concentrator is connected to the central computer via a high capacity line. A concentrator is generally subject to technological constraints on the amount of traffic it can manage, and each terminal has its capacity requirement. The problem then is to determine the number and location of concentrators and to allocate the terminals to these concentrators at minimum cost. This is known as the concentrator location problem. If the number and location of concentrators are already known beforehand, the problem then reduces to determining the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminals</b> only. This is known as the terminal assignment problem. These problems are NP-complete. Therefore, finding a polynomial time algorithm to solve them to optimality is highly unlikely. This study aims to develop some efficient algorithms based on simulated annealing to solve these problems. The results are compared to those given by some existing heuristics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{stochastic}} {{version of}} a concentrator location problem is dealt with in which traffic demand at each terminal location is uncertain. The concentrator location problem is defined as to determine the following: (i) the numbers and locations of concentators {{that are to be}} open, and (ii) the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminals</b> to concentrator sites. The problem is formulated as a stochastic multi-stage integer linear program, with first stage binary variables concerning network design and continuous recourse variables concerning expansion of capacity. Given a first stage decision, the series of realization of traffic demand may possibly imply a violation of the capacity constraint of the concentrator. Therefore from the second stage to the last stage, recourse action is taken to correct the violation. The objective function minimizes the cost of connecting terminals and the cost of opening concentrators and the expected recourse cost of capacity expansion. We propose a new algorithm which combines an L-shaped method and a branch-and-bound method. Under some assumptions it decomposes the problem into a set of problems as many as the number of stages in parallel. Finally we demonstrate the computational efficiency of our algorithm for the multi-stage model. 1...|$|E

Based on detailed description of two previously unknown species of the isopod genus Macrostylis Sars, 1864, the changes in the morphology that can occur during the final moult of the males are highlighted. M. dorsaetosa n. sp. is unlike any other species owing to the row of spine-like setae on the posterior margins of pereonites 5 – 6.

In M. papillata n. sp., cuticular ridges overlap posteriorly with the margin of the pereonites 1 – 4 and head forming a warty appearance. This species is easily identifiable and unlike any previously described macrostylid owing to the presence of the tergal articulation between pleonite 1 and pleotelson.
