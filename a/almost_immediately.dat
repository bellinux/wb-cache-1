5|$|Despite these improvements, {{a second}} {{invasion}} {{by the former}} Katangan gendarmerie, known as Shaba II in May–June 1978, was only dispersed with the despatch of the French 2e régiment étranger de parachutistes and a battalion of the Belgian Paracommando Regiment.

5|$|In 1184, a great fire at Glastonbury {{destroyed}} the monastic buildings. Reconstruction began <b>almost</b> <b>immediately</b> and the Lady Chapel, {{which includes the}} well, was consecrated in 1186.

5|$|Problems for the Portuguese arose <b>almost</b> <b>immediately</b> {{when the}} {{offensive}} {{coincided with the}} beginning of the monsoon season, creating additional logistical difficulties. Not only were the Portuguese soldiers badly equipped, but there was very poor cooperation, if any at all, between the FAP and the army. Thus, the army lacked close air support from the FAP. Mounting Portuguese casualties began to outweigh FRELIMO casualties, leading to further political intervention from Lisbon.|$|E

5|$|With {{some people}} unable {{to believe that}} the Japanese would be so ruthless, rumours began to spread <b>almost</b> <b>immediately</b> after news of the attack was made public. The most common rumour was that Centaur had been {{carrying}} munitions or commandos {{at the time of her}} sinking, with the Japanese made aware of this prior to her departure. This stemmed from an incident involving the ambulance drivers' weapons during loading in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|With the {{fighting}} at an end, {{the task of}} bringing home American soldiers began <b>almost</b> <b>immediately.</b> Henry R.

Alma rapidly fell apart, and degenerated into a weak low pressure area by June 1.|$|E
5|$|A further Bill in 1740 sought {{powers to}} improve the river from Barnby Dun to Fishlake Ferry. Despite serious opposition, which {{included}} the merchants and traders of Doncaster as well as Doncaster Corporation, the Bill was passed, giving the company new powers to make the river deeper and create a cut to avoid the shallows at Stainforth and Bramwith.

5|$|A {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas, {{armed with a}} Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off, while the {{aircraft}} {{was still in the}} climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed <b>almost</b> <b>immediately,</b> leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly.|$|E
5|$|After {{the station}} was closed it was <b>almost</b> <b>immediately</b> modified. The western headwalls of both {{platform}} tunnels were rebuilt to allow a step plate junction to be installed, providing access from the eastbound and westbound tunnels to a new siding located between Down Street and Hyde Park Corner. The siding is mainly used to reverse westbound trains, but {{could also be used}} for servicing trains. The siding tunnel is accessible at its western end through a small foot tunnel constructed from Hyde Park Corner station. The lifts were removed and the shafts adapted to provide additional tunnel ventilation.|$|E
