40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{ecotoxic}} potential of a new zero-valent iron nanomaterial produced for the elimination of chlorinated pollutants at contaminated sites. Abiotic dechlorination through the newly developed nanoscale zero-valent iron material and its effects on dechlorinating bacteria were investigated in anaerobic batch and column experiments. The aged, i. e. oxidized, iron material was characterization with dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis, x-ray diffractometry and cell-free reactive oxygen measurements. Furthermore, it was evaluated in <b>aerobic</b> ecotoxicological <b>test</b> <b>systems</b> with algae, crustacean, and fish, and also applied in a mechanism specific test for mutagenicity. The anaerobic column experiments showed co-occurrence of abiotic and biological dechlorination of the common groundwater contaminant perchloroethene. No prolonged toxicity of the nanomaterial (measured for up to 300 days) towards the investigated dechlorinating microorganism was observed. The nanomaterial has a flake like appearance and an inhomogeneous size distribution. The toxicity to crustacean and fish was calculated and the obtained EC 50 values were 163 mg/L and 458 mg/L, respectively. The nanomaterial showed no mutagenicity. It physically interacted with algae, which had implications for further testing and the evaluation of the results. Thus, the newly developed iron nanomaterial was slightly toxic in its reduced state but no prolonged toxicity was recorded. The aquatic tests revealed a low toxicity with EC 50 values ≥ 163 mg/L. These concentrations are unlikely to be reached in the aquatic environment. Hence, this nanomaterial is probably of no environmental concern not prohibiting its application for groundwater remediation...|$|R

(b) The pH of patients' sera, inoculated with hemolytic streptococci, progressed in the alkaline direction {{as did the}} sterile specimens. (c) The pH of normal sera, inoculated with hemolytic streptococci, pursued a variable course at lower levels than the sterile specimens.

The inactivation of highly potent samples of sera required a greater reduction in pH than did {{specimens of}} moderate killing activity. (b) Normal sera, adjusted to pH 9. 2 or higher, exhibited a relatively slowly acting bactericidal process, which seemed to represent the toxic effect of alkalinity. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>Tests.</b> Effect of Glutathione and Sodium Ascorbate. —The streptococcidal action of patients' sera was markedly impaired by the addition of reducing agents.

30|$|Tests {{according}} to OECD TGs 216 and 217 {{are used for}} the assessment of chemicals as required, e.g., in the context of regulation. OECD TG 216 describes a laboratory test that is used to investigate the long-term effects of chemicals on the microbial nitrogen transformation resulting in nitrate accumulation after a single exposure. The measured nitrate concentration reflects the sum of several microbial activities, such as ammonification, nitrification, denitrification, and formation of microbial biomass. Denitrification is expected to be of minor relevance due to the <b>aerobic</b> <b>test</b> conditions. Sieved soil is supplemented with powdered plant meal (e.g., lucerne meal). According to the OECD test guideline, for non-agrochemicals, the nitrate concentrations in treated and control samples are measured {{at the start of the}} test and after incubation for 28 days; for agrochemicals additional sampling points are requested. We applied this test to two silver nanomaterials and the soluble silver salt AgNO 3, and by considering only the start and end point, we found no evidence of toxicity towards soil-nitrifying bacteria. However, the same concentrations of test materials showed clear concentration-effect curves in the carbon transformation test (substrate-induced respiration) [3]. For strongly biocidal compounds, dose-related inhibition of substrate-induced respiration combined with a stimulated N-mineralization is typical [19]. In the following chapters, we discuss/consider the unusual sensitivity of both <b>test</b> <b>systems</b> (effects in C-transformation test; no effect in N-transformation test) when investigating Ag-NM and soluble AgNO 3.|$|R

Objectives: The main {{aim of the}} work was to determine and evaluate the profile of physical fitness {{of the members of}} the Close Protection Division, Protective Services of the Police of the Czech Republic. Methods: The work has character of emprical research, its main method was observation. Research sample was composed of 21 members (age range 28 - 55) of the Close Protection Division of Protection Service of the Police of Czech Republic. Within complex testing were used non-invasive methods (anthropomotoric testing, analysis of body composition, anaerobic and <b>aerobic</b> <b>testing,</b> tests for local power and tests of reactivity). An invasive method was also used to test a capillary blood sample to determine the cholesterol level and the postworkout lactate level in blood. Somatic factors were eveluated individualy (antropometry, somatotype, body composition). Conditioning claims were also evaluated (anaerobic, aerobic, lokal power). Within psychophysiological requirements as tested reactivity on acustic and optical signal and as a last there were found out information from health area, blood pressure was measured and compared to level of cholesterol of research sample. Results: The results of observation has [...] ...|$|R
