5|$|In <b>Austria,</b> {{versions}} of the game first appeared as Business and Spekulation (Speculation), and eventually evolved to become Das Kaufmännische Talent (DKT) (The Businessman's Talent). Versions of DKT have been sold in <b>Austria</b> since 1940. The game first appeared as Monopoly in <b>Austria</b> in about 1981. The Waddingtons edition was imported into The Netherlands starting in 1937, and a fully translated edition first appeared in 1941.|$|E
5|$|The Babonići and the Kőszegis made an {{alliance}} with the Dukes of <b>Austria</b> in January 1336. John of Bohemia, who claimed Carinthia from the Habsburgs, invaded <b>Austria</b> in February. CasimirIII of Poland came to <b>Austria</b> to assist him in late June. Charles soon joined them at Marchegg. The dukes sought reconciliation and signed a peace treaty with John of Bohemia in July. Charles signed a truce with them on 13December, and launched a new expedition against <b>Austria</b> early the next year. He forced the Babonići and the Kőszegis to yield, and the latter were also compelled to hand over to him their fortresses along the frontier in exchange for faraway castles. Charles's peace treaty with Albert and Otto of <b>Austria,</b> which was signed on 11September 1337, forbade both the dukes and Charles to give shelter to the other party's rebellious subjects.|$|E

5|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1918 and the proclamation of the First Austrian Republic, diplomatic relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were established on 25 February 1924. The first Soviet Plenipotentiary in Vienna was Yan Antonovich Berzin. Diplomatic relations were broken in March 1938 after the German invasion of <b>Austria</b> and its incorporation into Nazi Germany. After the Second World War, the USSR and <b>Austria</b> re-established diplomatic relations at the level of political representation, which in 1953 was converted into embassies. The preamble of the Austrian State Treaty, signed on 15 May 1955 by the USSR, United States, United Kingdom, France and <b>Austria,</b> established that the treaty formed the basis of Soviet relations with <b>Austria.</b> After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, relations continued between the Russian Federation and the Austrian state.|$|E
5|$|As a consequence, <b>Austria</b> {{withdrew from}} the Coalition. Although France had not {{completely}} defeated them, the Treaty of Schönbrunn, signed on 14 October 1809, imposed a heavy political, territorial, and economic price. France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to France's ally Poland. The Salzburg area went to the French ally, Bavaria. <b>Austria</b> lost over three million subjects, about 20 percent of her total population, which dramatically reduced the military force that <b>Austria</b> could field. Francis also agreed to pay an indemnity equivalent to almost 85 million francs, gave recognition to Joseph Bonaparte as the King of Spain, and affirmed Habsburg participation in Napoleon's Continental System. Francis reluctantly agreed to Napoleon's marriage with his daughter, Marie Louise, which Napoleon assumed, incorrectly, would eliminate <b>Austria</b> as a future threat.|$|E

5000|$|Potentially {{the most}} {{damaging}} element of the backlash, however, was the response of <b>Austria's</b> largely Liberal German population. While the unification of Germany and opposition to <b>Austria's</b> many pro-unification Germans had been a reason to support the Hohenwart-Schäffle program, it quickly became a reason to oppose it. Franz Josef's Foreign Minister Beust, feared the power of <b>Austria's</b> new German neighbor, having witnessed its crushing defeat of France. Beust cooperated with Andrássy, and advised the Emperor against accepting the Articles. In addition, Bismarck and [...] Wilhelm I of Germany themselves made clear to Franz Josef their displeasure over the marginalization of <b>Austria's</b> Germans.|$|R
50|$|The People's Party {{is popular}} mainly amongst white-collar workers, owners of {{large and small}} businesses, and farmers. In particular, it {{receives}} the backing {{of a majority of}} <b>Austria's</b> civil servants, a remarkably large and influential group due to the size and scope of <b>Austria's</b> government bureaucracy. <b>Austria's</b> blue-collar workers, by comparison, tend to endorse the Social Democratic Party and the Freedom Party.

5|$|France, {{friendly}} towards both Russia and <b>Austria,</b> {{suggested a}} series of territorial adjustments, in which <b>Austria</b> would be compensated by parts of Prussian Silesia, and Prussia in turn would receive Polish Ermland (Warmia) {{and parts of the}} Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a Polish fief already under Baltic German hegemony. King Frederick II of Prussia had no intention of giving up Silesia, gained recently in the Silesian Wars. He was, however, also interested in finding a peaceful solution– his alliance with Russia would draw him into a potential war with <b>Austria,</b> and the Seven Years' War had left Prussia's treasury and army weakened. He was also interested in protecting the weakening Ottoman Empire, which could be advantageously utilized {{in the event of a}} Prussian war either with Russia or <b>Austria.</b> Frederick's brother, Prince Henry, spent the winter of 1770–71 as a representative of the Prussian court at Saint Petersburg. As <b>Austria</b> had annexed 13 towns in the Hungarian Szepes region in 1769 (violating the Treaty of Lubowla), Catherine II of Russia and her advisor General Ivan Chernyshyov suggested to Henry that Prussia claim some Polish land, such as Ermland. After Henry informed Frederick of the proposal, the Prussian monarch suggested a partition of the Polish borderlands by <b>Austria,</b> Prussia, and Russia, with the largest share going to the party most weakened by the recent changes in balance of power, <b>Austria.</b> Thus Frederick attempted to encourage Russia to direct its expansion towards weak and dysfunctional Poland instead of the Ottomans. Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz counter-proposed that Prussia take lands from Poland in return for relinquishing Silesia to <b>Austria,</b> but this plan was rejected by Frederick.|$|E

40|$|In 1992 <b>Austria's</b> {{exports to}} Eastern Europe rose by 7 percent, those to East Central Europe by 17 percent.

After substantial {{gains in the}} years 1990 and 1991, <b>Austria's</b> export sector lost market shares in East Central Europe in 1992. These losses {{might be due to}} the fact that the EFTA concluded free trade agreements with these countries later than the EC.

5|$|In {{a memorable}} event, Metternich argued with Napoleon at Napoleon's 39th {{birthday}} celebrations in August 1808 over the increasingly obvious preparations for war on both sides. Soon after, Napoleon refused Metternich's {{attendance at the}} Congress of Erfurt; Metternich was later glad to hear from Talleyrand that Napoleon's attempts at the Congress to get Russia to invade <b>Austria</b> had proved unsuccessful. In late 1808 Metternich was recalled to Vienna for five weeks of meetings {{about the possibility of}} <b>Austria</b> invading France while Napoleon was on campaign in Spain. His memoranda reported that France was not united behind Napoleon, that Russia was unlikely to want to fight <b>Austria,</b> and that France had few reliable troops that could fight in central Europe. Back in Paris, Metternich was overtly apprehensive about his own safety. When <b>Austria</b> declared war on France, Metternich was indeed arrested in retaliation for the arrest of two French diplomats in Vienna, but the effects of this were minimal. He was allowed to leave France under escort for <b>Austria</b> in late May 1809. After Napoleon's capture of Vienna Metternich was conducted to the Austrian capital and exchange there for the French diplomats.|$|E

5|$|On 21 August 1245 Pope Innocent IV freed Béla of {{the oath}} of {{fidelity}} he had taken to Emperor Frederick during the Mongol invasion. In the following year Duke Frederick II of <b>Austria</b> invaded Hungary. He routed Béla's army in the Battle of the Leitha River on 15 June 1246, but perished in the battlefield.

Béla decided to intervene in the conflict only after the danger of a second Mongol invasion had diminished {{by the end of the}} 1240s. In retaliation of a former Austrian incursion into Hungary, Béla made a plundering raid into <b>Austria</b> and Styria in the summer of 1250. In this year he met and concluded a peace treaty with Daniil Romanovich, Prince of Halych in Zólyom (Zvolen, Slovakia).
