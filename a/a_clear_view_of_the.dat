5|$|The Nanjakana {{compound}} is {{the most}} highly elevated of the three compounds in the rova at Ambohimanga.

To the north of the compound is a stone esplanade that offers <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding areas where Andrianampoinimerina reportedly came to reflect on his military strategy for bringing Imerina under his control. During the 1861 funeral of Queen Ranavalona I held in the Nanjakana compound, a spark accidentally ignited a nearby barrel of gunpowder destined for use in the ceremony, causing an explosion and fire that killed a number of bystanders and destroyed three of the compound's historic royal residences.|$|E

The two secondary runways were raised up into the stands and also had view screens inside the construction.

5|$|Saladin besieged Tiberias in {{the eastern}} Galilee on 3 July 1187 and the Crusader army {{attempted}} to attack the Ayyubids by way of Kafr Kanna. After hearing of the Crusaders' march, Saladin led his guard back to their main camp at Kafr Sabt, leaving a small detachment at Tiberias. With <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crusader army, Saladin ordered al-Muzaffar Umar to block the Crusaders' entry from Hattin by taking a position near Lubya, while Gökböri and his troops were stationed at a hill near al-Shajara. On 4 July the Crusaders advanced toward the Horns of Hattin and charged against the Muslim forces, but were overwhelmed and defeated decisively. Four days after the battle, Saladin invited al-Adil {{to join him in}} the reconquest of Palestine, Galilee and Lebanese coast. On 8 July the Crusader stronghold of Acre was captured by Saladin, while his forces seized Nazareth and Saffuriya; other brigades took Haifa, Caesarea, Sebastia and Nablus, while al-Adil conquered Mirabel and Jaffa. On 26 July, Saladin returned to the coast and received the surrender of Sarepta, Sidon, Beirut, and Jableh. In August, the Ayyubids conquered Ramla, Darum, Gaza, Bayt Jibrin, and Latrun. Ascalon was taken on 4 September. In September–October 1187, the Ayyubids besieged Jerusalem, taking possession of it on 2 October, after negotiations with Balian of Ibelin.|$|E

25|$|However, if a fielder {{takes up}} {{position}} at square leg or somewhere {{so as to}} block his view, or {{if there is an}} injured batsman with a runner, then the umpire must move somewhere else – typically either a short distance or to point {{on the opposite side of}} the batsman.

From his defensive position, Gilliland had <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defile through which many of the attackers were approaching. Using his automatic rifle, he fired continuously into the defile, even after suffering a severe head wound while chasing down two Chinese soldiers who had breached the defensive line.

25|$|All the 14 {{sections}} vary {{significantly from}} one another and were designed {{in such a way}} as to the differentiation of sections not leading to any break in the walkway, which is a continuous walking stretch from the Triumph of Labour Statue to the Kamaraj Statue. One of these galleries is flanked by two semi-circular stainless-steel pergolas resting on wire-cut brick columns. The galleries can accommodate over 1,000 people. The choice of natural stones and pillars used in each section of the promenade was based on the type of the buildings on the other side of the road. The walkway was designed as low-lying as is necessary to have <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beach from the road. A total of 428 octagonal poles with seagull-shaped light fittings and additional high-mast lamps have been erected.|$|E

The proposal was submitted to the Direcção-Geral de Assuntos Culturais (General Directorate on Cultural Issues). While the church was given from the city government to the Regional Government in 1977, it wasn't until 1993 before the first modern renovations were started by theSecretaria Regional de Educação e Cultura (Regional Secretariate for Education and Culture). During these recuperations a tunnel staircase and room was discovered partially destroyed in the main courtyard, which was the accessway and older cistern destroyed when Nicolau Maria Raposo's family occupied the land.|$|E

25|$|User {{equivalent}} range errors (UERE) {{are shown}} in the table. There is also a numerical error with an estimated value, , of about 1 meter. The standard deviations, , for the coarse/acquisition (C/A) and precise codes are also shown in the table. These standard deviations are computed by taking the square root of {{the sum of the}} squares of the individual components (i.e., RSS for root sum squares). To get the standard deviation of receiver position estimate, these range errors must be multiplied by the appropriate dilution of precision terms and then RSS'ed with the numerical error. Electronics errors are one of several accuracy-degrading effects outlined in the table above. When taken together, autonomous civilian GPS horizontal position fixes are typically accurate to about 15 meters (50ft). These effects also reduce the more precise P(Y) code's accuracy. However, the advancement of technology means that in the present, civilian GPS fixes under <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky are on average accurate to about 5 meters (16ft) horizontally.|$|E
25|$|Campbell's Field opened {{alongside}} of the Ben Franklin Bridge in May 2001 {{after two}} years of construction. Campbell's Field is a 6,700-seat baseball park in Camden, New Jersey, United States that hosted its first regular season baseball game on May 11, 2001. The riverfront project was a joint venture backed by the state, Rutgers University, Cooper's Ferry Development Association and the Delaware River Port Authority. The construction of the ballpark was a 24 million dollar project that also included 7 million dollars in environmental remediation costs before building. Before the construction of Cambell's Field, the plot of land was vacant and historically known to house industrial buildings and businesses such as Campbell Soup Company Plant No. 2, Pennsylvania & Reading Rail Road's Linden Street Freight Station. The park, located at Delaware and Penn Avenues on the Camden Waterfront features a view of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge connecting Camden and <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Philadelphia Skyline.|$|E
25|$|In 1748, the Academy of Arts {{commissioned}} a monumental {{statue of the}} king on horseback by the sculptor Bouchardon, and the Academy of Architecture was assigned to create a square, to be called Place Louis XV, where it could be erected. The site selected was the marshy open space between the Seine, the moat and bridge to the Tuileries garden, and the Champs-Élysées, {{which led to the}} Étoile, convergence of hunting trails on {{the western edge of the}} city (now Place Charles de Gaulle-Étoile). The winning plans for the square and buildings next to it were drawn by the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel. Gabriel designed two large mansions with a street between them, Rue Royale, designed to give <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statue in the center of the square. Construction began in 1754, and the statue was put in place and dedicated on 23 February 1763. The two large mansions were still unfinished, but the façades were finished in 1765-66.|$|E
