50|$|Typical snout to vent length {{will fall}} {{within the range of}} 7.8 to 18.4 cm, with the length of the tail being roughly twice as long as the body. These creatures are covered with scales, the scales located on their stomach being {{slightly}} keeled while the other scales on their body remain flat. They have a general green color around their body but shades vary due to environmental variation and season. All <b>alligator</b> <b>lizards</b> have yellow eyes, with a long, slender, forked tongue. A. aurita can be distinguished from other similar <b>alligator</b> <b>lizards</b> by having a slightly more pale green color on their scales, accompanied by black molting around the edges. One way you can tell the difference between the male and the female are by head shape, the male will sometimes have a slightly broader head then the female. In addition, adult males can be distinguished as having orange coloration on the posterior third portion of the scales on the dorsal side of their head. However, most of these distinctions are only noticed by a professional and it can be tricky for amateurs to tell the two sexes apart.|$|R
40|$|Panamint <b>alligator</b> <b>lizards</b> (Elgaria panamintina) are a rare lizard species {{endemic to}} Inyo County, California. Little {{is known about}} the species and it is thought to be of {{conservation}} concern. Monitoring efforts for rare species requires conservative marking methods, however most marking methods for herpetofauna are invasive and potentially harmful. I evaluated a non-invasive method of individual identification using photographs of Elgaria head lepidosis in the freeware program Interactive Individual Identification System. Two hundred and thirty nine specimens from four species of <b>alligator</b> <b>lizards</b> were evaluated with a method accuracy of over 99 %. In addition to being highly accurate, this marking method was low cost, fast, and efficient. I also reviewed the existing research on E. panamintina and the threats to its survival. Using this information, I developed a Maximum Entropy species distribution model to determine where the species may occur on the landscape. While the model exhibited a high likelihood of statistical overfitting, it successfully predicted the presence of E. panamintina in several previously undocumented locations. Twenty seven hours of field survey efforts yielded only one individual indicating that this species is likely rare and difficult to detect. Further field surveys guided by the species distribution model will likely uncover additional new populations of this species. CSU, Chic...|$|R
