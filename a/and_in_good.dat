5|$|Beyond West Brighton near a NYCDEP water {{pollution}} control facility, the line rose onto a reinforced concrete trestle {{known as the}} Port Richmond Viaduct, crossing Bodine Creek and running for about a mile through the Port Richmond neighborhood. West of Nicholas Avenue near Port Richmond High School, the line entered an open cut, crossing under the Bayonne Bridge approach and continued west to the Arlington Yard and station at South Avenue. Rapid transit service continued via a northern spur to Port Ivory; freight service passed the current Howland Hook Marine Terminal (adjacent to Port Ivory) and crossed the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge to Cranford Junction in New Jersey. The right-of-way from the Port Richmond Viaduct to Arlington Yard has remained intact <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> condition, though the former station sites and infrastructure are dilapidated and need rehabilitation or replacement should passenger service be reactivated.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{remained}} active <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> health {{right through}} his retirement despite the gradual onset of deafness, but {{the death of}} his wife Ethel in March 1967 took a deep toll on him. He died on 25 August 1967 at the age of 84. He was the last surviving member of Billy Hughes' Cabinet. His memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields and was widely attended, including by representatives of the Royal Family. His ashes were scattered over Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra. The Canberra suburb of Bruce, and the electoral Division of Bruce based in south-east Melbourne, were both named for him after his death.|$|E

5|$|Despite Chotiner's {{maneuvering}} for Nixon, {{the senator}} was still uncertain {{if he should}} take the vice-presidential slot if offered. Pat Nixon wanted her husband to decline it. Chotiner argued to the Nixons that if the Republicans lost, Nixon would retain his seat in the Senate, that if he served as Vice President and re-entered private life, {{he would have a}} lucrative legal career, but that if Nixon did not move up to the Vice Presidency, with Senator Knowland relatively young <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> health, Nixon was likely to remain merely the junior senator from California for many years to come. Eisenhower offered Nixon the position, the senator accepted, and with Knowland's re-election bid all but won, Chotiner became Nixon's campaign manager.|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus {{material}} included vertebrae, ribs, partial pelvis, and gastroliths. The vertebrae {{were certainly}} from the cervical and dorsal regions, and are articulated. The two cervicals are not greatly preserved, although the twelve dorsals are articulated <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> condition. Other vertebral material includes seven centra that are fragmentary {{and a few}} neural arches, which are unattached. 12 dorsal ribs are preserved, {{as well as some}} appendicular elements. David Weishampel et al. did not recognize all the material as belonging to Dinheirosaurus, and only found 9 dorsals in the holotype, while also misinterpreting the pubis as a limb fragment. They also incorrectly stated that it was found in the Camadas de Alcobaça Formation. Another pair of vertebrae, under collection number ML 418, was originally assigned to Dinheirosaurus by Bonaparte and Mateus, but is now considered to be a distinct new unnamed genus of diplodocid.|$|E

5|$|Though Thomas Higgins's {{death by}} {{apparent}} dysentery raised no {{questions for the}} attending doctor, Higgins's brother Patrick was {{surprised to hear that}} his brother, who had been strong <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> general health, could have succumbed so easily to illness. When he also discovered that his brother has been insured with five different burial societies, which left his widow with a profit of around £100, he pursued the matter with the authorities. A postmortem examination was ordered on Higgins's body. To the surprise of mourners, the coroner arrived at the home to perform the examination during the wake being held there for Higgins. Catherine Flannagan, upon hearing that a full autopsy was to be performed, fled the home.|$|E
5|$|Carus's death, amid a {{successful}} war with Persia and in mysterious circumstances – he was believed (perhaps {{as a result}} of later Diocletianic propaganda) to have been struck by lightning – left his sons Numerian and Carinus as the new Augusti. Carinus quickly made his way to Rome from his post in Gaul as imperial commissioner and arrived there by January 284, becoming legitimate Emperor in the West. Numerian lingered in the East. The Roman withdrawal from Persia was orderly and unopposed. The Sassanid king Bahram II could not field an army against them as he was still struggling to establish his authority. By March 284, Numerian had only reached Emesa (Homs) in Syria; by November, only Asia Minor. In Emesa he was apparently still alive <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> health: he issued the only extant rescript in his name there, but after he left the city, his staff, including the prefect (Numerian's father-in-law, and as such the dominant influence in the Emperor's entourage) Aper, reported that he suffered from an inflammation of the eyes. He traveled in a closed coach from then on. When the army reached Bithynia, some of the soldiers smelled an odor emanating from the coach. They opened its curtains and inside they found Numerian dead. Both Eutropius and Aurelius Victor describe Numerian's death as an assassination.|$|E
5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E

5|$|The two 20th Century Fox films—The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes—had survived {{complete}} <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> condition, {{but those}} in the Universal series suffered badly over the years, as they passed through the hands of different copyright owners. In 1993 the UCLA Film and Television Archive started a restoration project on the series after the unstable cellulose nitrate film {{was found to be}} suffering from deterioration. Restoration on the first six films—The Woman in Green, The Pearl of Death, Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon, The Scarlet Claw, Terror by Night and The Spider Woman—took four years from 1993; the costs for the restoration were met by UCLA and Hugh Hefner, who was a fan of the Rathbone-Holmes series. From 1998 Warner Bros. matched Hefner's funding and the remaining six films—Dressed to Kill, Pursuit to Algiers, Sherlock Holmes Faces Death, The House of Fear, Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror and Sherlock Holmes in Washington—were then restored, a process that was completed in 2001.|$|E
