5|$|Seemingly gone forever, another Scarlet member {{known as}} Xi-Tiger {{took control of}} the organization. Under his rule, Scarlet became too brutal even for themselves, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> for Epsilon to reclaim his position. More or less {{isolated}} {{from the rest of the}} group, Xi sought to find and assassinate Epsilon himself. He planned an attack on an A-Human research laboratory, where children with special abilities had been kidnapped and experimented on. Upon arriving, Xi-Tiger sensed the presence of Epsilon in one of the boys. However, he was unsure because he couldn't pinpoint the evil from Epsilon, who had entered the boy's body and was now living as a parasite. Xi-Tiger took a young girl hostage and threatened to kill her unless Epsilon revealed himself. The boy flew into a rage and morphed his body into Epsilon himself. Xi seemed to sense this strange power, and in fear, killed the girl and fled. Epsilon had completely split his dual personality apart; with both good and evil Epsilons now chasing after Xi-Tiger.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1991, Anderson formed a tag team with Larry Zbyszko <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> {{themselves}} The Enforcers. After competing for several months and moving up in the tag team ranks, they successfully captured the WCW World Tag Team Championship on September 2, 1991. The reign would be short lived, however, as they lost the titles roughly {{two and a half}} months later to Ricky Steamboat and Dustin Rhodes. Anderson and Zbyszko went their separate ways shortly afterward. Anderson quickly rebounded from his split with Zbyszko and formed a tag team with Beautiful Bobby Eaton, a long-time friend and best known for his time as one half of the Midnight Express. At this point, they were members of Paul E. Dangerously's Dangerous Alliance. They quickly moved up the tag team division and were soon a threat to Steamboat and Rhodes. Anderson and Eaton quickly won the titles on January 16, 1992 and defended the titles against all comers for the next four and a half months before losing the titles to The Steiner Brothers in May.|$|E
500|$|Carey co-wrote and co-produced {{the song}} [...] "Whenever You Call" [...] with {{longtime}} collaborator Walter Afanasieff for her album, Butterfly. However, {{in order to}} change the song's tempo and format, Carey decided to re-do the song as a duet with Brian McKnight, because she felt {{it was one of}} the best songs on Butterfly. Carey had also expressed how McKnight's vocals added a great deal to the song, describing the project as [...] "perfecting the song". McKnight shared similar sentiments, saying, [...] "It was amazing to go into the studio with someone who's so successful, and has that kind of track record. Mariah is someone who could ask anyone in the world to sing with her, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> me.

The single collection was found growing on fallen oak leaves at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, in Solano County, California in January 1856. The specimen {{was sent by}} American mycologist Moses Ashley Curtis to his British colleague Miles Joseph Berkeley, who published {{a brief description of}} the species in 1860, calling it Agaricus californiensis, in what was then the subgenus Mycena. Berkeley and Curtis noted that it differed from A.aurantio-marginatus (known today as Mycena aurantiomarginata) in the nature of the gills, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> it [...] "a more graceful species." [...] In his 1887 Sylloge Fungorum, Pier Andrea Saccardo raised the subgenus Mycena to generic status, so the species became known as Mycena californiensis.|$|E

500|$|With the {{publication}} of the 25th anniversary edition in 2000, the historians of biology Michael Yudell and Rob Desalle reviewed the nature-nurture controversy around the book. [...] "Once again", they wrote, [...] "biological reductionism and genetic determinism became the focus of rancorous debates, discussions and diatribes within both academia and popular culture." [...] They pointed out that the quest for a [...] "sociobiologization" [...] of biology was not new, mentioning Darwin's The Descent of Man, R.A. Fisher, and Julian Huxley, all touching on the biological basis of human society, followed by Konrad Lorenz, Desmond Morris and Robert Ardrey in the 1960s, and Richard Dawkins and David Barash in the 1970s. Wilson's choice of title echoed the modern synthesis (named by Huxley in 1942) and, the reviewers argued, meant to build upon and extend it. 25 years on, they noted, most of the discord had gone, and the discipline had been renamed as evolutionary psychology; they were surprised to find that Wilson was happy with that, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> the new discipline pop psychology for people [...] "who like telling just-so stories".|$|E
