5000|$|The {{development}} of more efficient OHC mass-production car engines in the 1960s, combining overhead crossflow valves with the low cost of a single camshaft encouraged engines with overhead rockers, directly beneath a single overhead camshaft.

40|$|Using a new {{international}} dataset of trade-weighed exchange rates, this paper highlights a neglected adjustment mechanism in the classical gold standard literature. Since gold-pegged countries traded extensively with economies operating more flexible monetary regimes and where parity change was a common <b>adjustment</b> <b>device</b> to systemic shocks, we show that such parity adjustments induced worldwide swings in nominal effective exchange rates. These translated into real exchange rate variations to which trade balances responded with an average elasticity of unity and {{in the direction of}} restoring external disequilibria. We conclude that some nominal exchange rate flexibility thus present in the pre- 1914 system was instrumental to international payments adjustment. ...|$|R

40|$|We study whether {{segmented}} {{labor markets}} with flexibility {{at the margin}} (e. g., just affecting fixed-term employees) can achieve similar volatility than fully deregulated labor markets.
