The new balance <b>adjusting</b> <b>system</b> comprises motor-reducer, timing belt, screw pair, slider-guideway and four rocker force sensors. According to information obtained by the four rocker force sensors, unbalanced value {{at both ends of}} the big arm is computed and heavy block is moved to achieve balance adjusting. In this paper, motor power and torque to move the heavy block is calculated. In full load running progress of centrifuge, the stress-strain of screw pair composed by adjusting nut and big arm are analyzed.

Surprisingly, we obtained the non-intuitive result that the existence of robust MB solutions does not require a third timescale. Thus, a natural question is: how many timescales are fundamentally important for generating SB solutions? To address this question, we adopt the approach used in [23] of transforming our original system into certain two-timescale systems by <b>adjusting</b> <b>system</b> parameters (see Table  5 in Appendix  1).

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of the size and development effort for software projects requires estimation models {{which can be used}} early enough in the development life cycle to be of practical value. Function Point Analysis (FPA) has become possibly the most widely used estimation technique in practice. However the technique was developed in the data processing environment of the 1970 's and, despite undergoing considerable reassessment and formalisation, still attracts criticism for the weighting scoring it employs and for {{the way in which the}} function point score is adapted for specific system characteristics. This paper reviews the validity of the weighting scheme and the value of <b>adjusting</b> for <b>system</b> characteristics by studying their effect in a sample of 299 software developments. In general the value adjustment scheme does not appear to cater for differences in productivity. The weighting scheme used to <b>adjust</b> <b>system</b> components in terms of being simple, average or complex also appears suspect and should be redesigned to provide a more realistic estimate of system functionality...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Time of Arrival (TOA) is {{a popular}} {{technique}} used for geolocation. This thesis evaluates the use of TOA techniques indoors. The accuracy of measuring distances using TOA {{is dependent on the}} bandwidth of the system and the multipath conditions between the receiver and transmitter. System bandwidth has a significant effect on the TOA measurement. Higher bandwidths provide significantly better performance under certain multipath conditions. While there are many multipath classifications to consider for indoor positioning, we can simplify analysis by considering just the Line of Sight (LOS) and Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) conditions. Based on several measurements performed in the OSU Mixed Signal Labs, a comprehensive analysis of the TOA estimate can be performed by <b>adjusting</b> <b>system</b> bandwidth and testing for LOS or NLOS conditions.
