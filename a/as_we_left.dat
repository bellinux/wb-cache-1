2500|$|In the 1969 film, Yawar Mallku/Sangre de cóndor/Blood of the Condor, Bolivian {{director}} Jorge Sanjinés portrayed Peace Corps {{volunteers in}} the camp as arrogant, ethnocentric, and narrow-minded imperialists out to destroy Indian culture. One particularly powerful scene showed Indians attacking a clinic while the volunteers inside sterilized Indian women against their will. The film {{is thought to be}} at least partially responsible for the expulsion of the Peace Corps from Bolivia in 1971. Peace Corps volunteer Fred Krieger who was serving in Bolivia at the time said, [...] "It was an effective movie – emotionally very arousing – and it directly targeted Peace Corps volunteers. I thought I would be lynched before getting out of the theatre. To my amazement, people around me smiled courteously <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left,</b> no one commented, it was just like any other movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Bogdanov's 1978 RSC {{production}} at the Aldwych Theatre, starring Jonathan Pryce and Paola Dionisotti. In this modern dress production, after the house lights went down, nothing happened on stage for a moment. Then, a commotion arose from within the audience. The house lights came back on, {{and a member of}} the audience (Pryce) is seen to be in altercation with an usherette (Dionisotti). After pushing the usherette to the ground, the man then clambered onto the stage, and began to smash parts of the set before being restrained by the usherette and theatre staff, stripped and thrown into a bath. The subsequent play was then presented as his dream. At several performances of the play, audience members were duped into thinking the fight between the man and the usherette was real, and several times, other audience members attempted to intervene in the conflict. This production very much embraced a feminist reading of the play, presenting the taming as a distasteful display of male chauvinism, with the process presented as Sly's dream of male domination and power over the usherette who had restrained him. In this version, Katherina delivers the final speech (with the men sitting not at a dining table but a poker table) in a toneless, lifeless voice, and although Petruchio appeared thoroughly ashamed of what he had done to her, he still collected his winnings from the other men before leaving. Dionisotti's own feelings about her delivery of the speech was that it was [...] "full of affection for women." [...] She also felt the production had a very bleak ending; [...] "the last image was of two very lonely people. The lights went down <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> - I following him, the others hardly noticing we'd gone. They'd got down to some hard gambling. They just closed ranks around the green baize table." [...] Michael Billington was especially complementary, praising Bogdanov for the honesty shown in [...] "his approach to this barbaric and disgusting play [...] Instead of softening its harsh edges like most recent directors, he has chosen to emphasise its moral and physical ugliness." [...] Graham Holderness argues of this production, [...] "Bogdanov was concerned to stress the continuities between the mercantile ethics of Renaissance Padua and the commercial values of modern-day British capitalism; between the oppression of women in Shakespeare's time, and the continuing exploitation of sex today; between the class-divisions of the sixteenth century and the economic inequality of the twentieth." ...|$|E
