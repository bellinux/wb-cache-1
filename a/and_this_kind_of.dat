Due to a failed weld, a steel cable snapped {{from a car}} being towed and hit the extra's car, damaging her skull. The extra, identified as Gabriela Cedillo, had to undergo brain surgery. The injury has left her permanently brain-damaged, paralyzed on her left side and her left eye stitched shut. Paramount admitted responsibility for the accident and covered all of Cedillo's medical costs. Nevertheless, Cedillo's family filed a lawsuit on October 5, citing seven counts of negligence against Paramount, and several other defendants (not including Bay), with total damages sought in excess of $350,000. Cedillo's attorney, Todd Smith, said, [...] "This was an attractive 24-year old girl who had dreams and aspirations involving acting, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> injury may well have a serious impact on her dreams." [...] The filed complaint reads that [...] "Cedillo has endured and will in the future endure pain and suffering; has become disfigured and disabled; has suffered a loss of the enjoyment of a normal life; has been damaged in her capacity to earn a living; has incurred and will in the future incur expenses for medical services, {{all of which are}} permanent in nature." [...] In response to the suit, Paramount released the following statement: [...] "We are all terribly sorry that this accident occurred. Our thoughts, prayers and best wishes are with Gabriela, her family and loved ones. The production will continue to provide all the help we can to Gabriela and her family during this difficult time." [...] On May 2012, it was revealed that an $18 million settlement had been reached between Paramount and the Cedillo family.|$|E

The {{newspaper}} {{has not been able}} to produce any images from the video showing Sheridan's face and Sheridan says the video is a fake. He conceded his voice was on the tape but suggested it was [...] "spliced" [...] with clips of the voice of someone else. The News of the World claimed four independent voice analysts had confirmed that the voice on the tape is that of Tommy Sheridan. However, in an interview with the BBC a forensic speech scientist, Peter French, said: [...] "Experts should never say conclusively they have identified a person <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> evidence should never solely be used to bring a criminal trial".|$|E
2500|$|In Tunisia, {{the pursuit}} of {{political}} feminism is so very necessary as it constitutes a main argument in the country's favourable image in the West. Indeed, although economic growth was not negligible, it did not match other North African countries like Morocco. The suppression of free expression and of political opposition tarnishes the country's reputation abroad. The feminine condition is {{an area in which}} Tunisia under Bourguiba, as under Ben Ali, can claim its distinctiveness. Collette Juilliard-Beaudan thinks that Tunisian women [...] "cease to choose a democratic form, (they) prefer secularism." [...] <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> propaganda succeeds in the West because the country under Bourguiba's administration profited from a solid reputation as a civil and secular republic in a region more often composed of military dictatorships and religiously dependent monarchies, although the Code itself was promulgated in an authoritarian manner, as it wasn't the object of public debate or of consideration in a constituent assembly.|$|E

2500|$|One {{can think}} of {{molecular}} docking as a problem of “lock-and-key”, in which one wants to find the correct relative orientation of the “key” which will open up the “lock” [...] (where {{on the surface of}} the lock is the key hole, which direction to turn the key after it is inserted, etc.). [...] Here, the protein can be thought of as the “lock” and the ligand can be thought of as a “key”. [...] Molecular docking may be defined as an optimization problem, which would describe the “best-fit” orientation of a ligand that binds to a particular protein of interest. [...] However, since both the ligand and the protein are flexible, a “hand-in-glove” analogy is more appropriate than “lock-and-key”. [...] During the course of the docking process, the ligand and the protein adjust their conformation to achieve an overall [...] "best-fit" [...] <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> conformational adjustment resulting in the overall binding is referred to as [...] "induced-fit".|$|E

Nonetheless, it was not inaccessible. [...] As Andrea Bianco urged, navigators should [...] "know how to multiply well and divide well" [...] ("saver ben moltiplichar e ben partir") [...] It is here where we see the important interface of commerce and navigation. [...] The mathematics of commerce – Arabic numerals, multiplication, division, fractions, the tools needed to calculate purchases and sales of goods and other commercial transactions – was {{essentially the same as}} the mathematics of navigation. [...] <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> mathematics was taught at the abacus schools which were set up in the 13th century in the commercial centers of northern Italy to train the sons of merchants, the very same class where Italian navigators were drawn from. [...] As historian E.G.R. Taylor notes, [...] "sailors were the first professional group to use mathematics in their everyday work" ...|$|E
2500|$|Speakerboxxx/The Love Below {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 91, based on 26 reviews. In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called both discs [...] "visionary, imaginative listens, providing {{some of the}} best music of 2003, regardless of genre". Will Hermes wrote in Entertainment Weekly that the album's [...] "ambition flies so far beyond that of anyone doing rap right now (or pop, or rock, or R)". Blender magazine's Kris Ex felt that it [...] "holds an explosion of creativity that couldn't have been contained in just one LP". The Guardians Dorian Lynskey described both discs as [...] "sublime... hip-hop's Sign o' the Times or The White Album: a career-defining masterpiece of breathtaking ambition". According to Andy Gill of The Independent, the album set [...] "a new benchmark not just for hip hop, but for pop in general". Stylus Magazines Nick Southall called it [...] "a series of spectacular moments and memorable events". NME magazine's John Mulvey described its two discs as [...] "two Technicolor explosions of creativity that people will be exploring, analysing and partying to for years". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote that it is [...] "greater {{than the sum of its}} parts, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> expertly crafted pop and deftly executed funk rarely happen at the same time—not since Stankonia, at least." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tyler {{composed}} {{several other}} new themes for the film, {{to represent the}} titular villain Ultron; the relationship that develops between Black Widow and the Hulk; and the new Avenger Vision. Tyler wanted Ultron's theme to sound [...] "almost heroic", since Ultron thinks he is saving the world, [...] "but dissonant and tweaky enough" [...] to reflect that [...] "he doesn't quite have it right" [...] and is still a villain. The melody is simple {{so that it is}} easy to remember, but starts flat by one note to make the theme sound slightly [...] "off", is played on two pianos with one of them out of tune, and when the main phrase is repeated the last note is played [...] "ahead by a beat" [...] the second time; [...] "not only out of tune, but out of time." [...] The theme also features an artificially distorted guitar to give it a machine-like tone. Tyler described the Black Widow/Hulk relationship as an [...] "unrequited romance <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> sad situation" [...] with [...] "the curse of the Hulk being a barrier between [...] and what they really want. And so that melody, that had to be almost like a lullaby, but broken." [...] Tyler wrote the [...] "lullaby" [...] to be understated, and it is often played on piano or cello. For the Vision's theme, Tyler [...] "wanted to go for something that was underneath and delicate, and had kind of a wispy nature to it, in a sense—and almost towards the romantic". He tried to reflect the character's role as a messianic figure of sorts, and Ultron's intended redemption for Earth, and said, [...] "you don’t really know what side he’s on. You have this guy who’s literally two minutes old and is born in this movie with this knowledge of humanity. It’s Machiavellian in a way." [...] The theme is an adagio that is [...] "not your typical bombast, look how muscley this guy is; it’s more of a mystery." [...] To represent the character's youth and questions about himself, it features string glissandos that constantly change between chords during his introduction, and often momentarily settle on uncertain notes and sounds. Tyler constantly instructed the orchestra to play quieter, [...] "trying to say more with less for Vision". The music for the visions that the Scarlet Witch gives the Avengers pays homage to scores from the 1950s, with Tyler using a [...] "randomly played" [...] vibraphone and strings such as a harp to create a [...] "dreaminess" [...] and [...] "hypnotic effect".|$|E
