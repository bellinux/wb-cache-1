5|$|Compared {{with other}} major {{periodicals}} of its day, the Analytical Review had a low circulation. While both the Tory Critical Review and the British Critic had {{a circulation of}} 3,500 by 1797 and the Monthly Review realized 5,000, Johnson and Christie's journal only ever achieved about 1,500. However, it was common practice during the eighteenth century for an individual copy of each publication to be read by many different people. Scholars have estimated that each copy of a London newspaper, for example, was read by thirty people; coffeehouses and taverns were well-stocked with copies of newspapers and journals, as were circulating libraries. Hence, circulation numbers offer only a small glimpse into how many people <b>actually</b> <b>read</b> such publications.|$|E

25|$|Representative Rodney Alexander (R-LA) {{stated that}} he learned of the five initial e-mails from Foley to the 16-year-old page from Louisiana {{in the fall of}} 2005, after a news {{reporter}} brought the matter to his attention. Alexander spoke to the boy's parents, who did not wish to pursue the matter beyond stopping the e-mails. Alexander's chief of staff met with Mike Stokke, Hastert's deputy chief of staff in the fall of 2005. They met with Trandahl. Contradictory statements have made it unclear whether they <b>actually</b> <b>read</b> the e-mails. Trandahl then met with Shimkus, and Shimkus and Trandahl met privately with Foley, and Shimkus told him to cease contact with the page. The other two congressional representatives on the House Page Committee (including the only Democrat) were not informed, and no formal investigative or disciplinary action was taken.|$|E

Thomas Henry Croxall, another early translator, Lowrie, and Dru all hoped that people would not just read about Kierkegaard but would <b>actually</b> <b>read</b> his works. Dru published an English translation of Kierkegaard's Journals in 1958; Alastair Hannay translated some of Kierkegaard's works. From the 1960s to the 1990s, Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong translated his works more than once. The first volume of their first version of the Journals and Papers (Indiana, 1967–1978) won the 1968 U.S. National Book Award in category Translation. They both dedicated their lives to the study of Søren Kierkegaard and his works, which are maintained at the Howard V. and Edna H. Hong Kierkegaard Library. Jon Stewart from the University of Copenhagen has written extensively about Søren Kierkegaard.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to these criticisms, in 1853 Stowe published A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin, an attempt to document the veracity of the novel's depiction of slavery. In the book, Stowe discusses each of the major characters in Uncle Tom's Cabin and cites [...] "real life equivalents" [...] to them while also mounting a more [...] "aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had." [...] Like the novel, A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin was a best-seller. However, while Stowe claimed A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin documented her previously consulted sources, she <b>actually</b> <b>read</b> many of the cited works only {{after the publication of}} her novel. [...] A major part of the Key was Stowe's critique of how the legal system supported slavery and licensed owners' mistreatment of slaves. Thus, Stowe put more than slavery on trial; she put the law on trial. This continued an important theme of Uncle Tom's Cabin—that the shadow of law brooded over the institution of slavery and allowed owners to mistreat slaves and then avoid punishment for their mistreatment. In some cases, as Stowe pointed out, it even prevented kind owners from freeing their slaves.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{the finish}} {{of the race}} there was a dispute over the winning time of Secretariat. The {{electronic}} Visumatic timer on the field read 1:55, while Daily Racing Form clockers Gene Schwartz and Frank Robinson timed Secretariat at 1:, which would have broken the track record. The official fractional times were 25, , 1:12, and 1:, while the Daily Racing Forum timed the fractions at , 47, 1:, and 1:. The next day, Secretariat's trainer Lucien Laurin asked for the videotape to be reviewed because he felt that if Secretariat did run that fast, then [...] "he deserves the record." [...] On May 21, race officials adjusted Secretariat's winning time to 1:, becoming the then second fastest time in race history. The time was changed to the time obtained by the official Pimilico timekeeper E.T. McLean per Rule 383 of the Maryland Rules of Racing, which stated the [...] "official timer's time is official." [...] McLean's stopwatch was faster than the Visumatic by three-fifths of a second at each fractional." [...] That same day, a Visumatic official checked the timer and stated that the timer should have <b>actually</b> <b>read</b> 1:, rather than 1:55. It was determined that the chart for the Preakness would display McLean's time as the winning time, with the Daily Racing Forum time written next to it, in parenthesis.|$|E
