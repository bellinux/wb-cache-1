40|$|Other {{than three}} {{extensively}} researched earnings thresholds, avoiding earnings declines, avoiding negative earnings and avoiding negative earnings surprises (Burgstahler and Dichev 1997; Degeorge, Patel, and Zeckhauser 1999), peer performance {{is an additional}} threshold that is often mentioned in news reports, compensation contracts and analysts’ reports, while largely ignored in the academic research. Thus, I examine whether firms manage earnings to achieve peer performance. First, I examine accruals-based earnings management to achieve peer performance. The empirical results show that firms exhibit more income-increasing accruals management in the current year under the following situations: 1) when firms’ prior year performance <b>is</b> <b>below</b> that of their peer group; 2) when firms’ average performance over the prior two years <b>is</b> <b>below</b> that of its peer group; 3) when firms’ expected performance <b>is</b> <b>below</b> its peer group’s expected performance. In addition, firms with cumulative performance that is {{lower than that of}} its peer group through the first three quarters of the fiscal year exhibit more upward accruals management in the fourth quarter. Second, I investigate real activities manipulation to achieve peer performance. The empirical results show that that firms exhibit more income-increasing real activities manipulation in the current year under the following situations: 1) when firms’ prior year performance <b>is</b> <b>below</b> that of their peer group; 2) when firms’ average performance over the prior two years <b>is</b> <b>below</b> that of its peer group. Third, firms that are under pressure to achieve peer performance benchmarks tend to restate financial statements in subsequent years. Specifically, firms under the following four situations are more likely to restate current earnings in the future: 1) firm’s prior year performance <b>is</b> <b>below</b> that of its peer group; 2) firm’s average performance over the prior two years <b>is</b> <b>below</b> that of its peer group; 3) firm’s expected performance <b>is</b> <b>below</b> that of its peer group; and 4) firm’s cumulative performance for the first three fiscal quarters <b>is</b> <b>below</b> that of its peer group. The influence of peer performance on earnings management behavior implies that relative performance evaluation can induce income-increasing earnings management and subsequent restatements...|$|R

5|$|Although most white dwarfs {{are thought}} to be {{composed}} of carbon and oxygen, spectroscopy typically shows that their emitted light comes from an atmosphere which is observed to be either hydrogen or helium dominated. The dominant element is usually at least 1,000 times more abundant than all other elements. As explained by Schatzman in the 1940s, the high surface gravity is thought to cause this purity by gravitationally separating the atmosphere so that heavy elements <b>are</b> <b>below</b> and the lighter above., §5–6 This atmosphere, {{the only part of the}} white dwarf visible to us, is thought to be the top of an envelope which is a residue of the star's envelope in the AGB phase and may also contain material accreted from the interstellar medium. The envelope is believed to consist of a helium-rich layer with mass no more than 1/100 of the star's total mass, which, if the atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated, is overlain by a hydrogen-rich layer with mass approximately 1/10,000 of the stars total mass., §4–5.|$|E
