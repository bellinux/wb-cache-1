In particular I argue that this theory {{can be used to}} explain how idiosyncratic usages of  mathematical signs by students (particularly when just introduced to <b>a</b> new <b>mathematical</b> object) get transformed into mathematically acceptable and personally meaningful usages. Related to this, I argue that this theory is able to bridge the divide between <b>an</b> individual’s <b>mathematical</b> knowledge and the body of socially sanctioned mathematical knowledge. I also demonstrate an application of the theory to an analysis of a student’s activities with <b>a</b> ‘new’ <b>mathematical</b> object...|$|R

5|$|A flow is {{a process}} in which the points of <b>a</b> <b>mathematical</b> space {{continuously}} change their locations or properties over time. More specifically, in a one-dimensional geometric flow such as the curve-shortening flow, the points undergoing the flow belong to a curve, and what changes is the shape of the curve, its embedding into the Euclidean plane determined by the locations of each of its points.|$|E

5|$|A {{group is}} <b>a</b> <b>mathematical</b> {{structure}} {{consisting of a}} set of objects together with a binary operation, that is, an operation combining any two objects to a third, subject to certain requirements. A group in which the objects are matrices and the group operation is matrix multiplication is called a matrix group. Since in a group every element has to be invertible, the most general matrix groups are the groups of all invertible matrices of a given size, called the general linear groups.|$|E
5|$|A matroid is <b>a</b> <b>mathematical</b> {{structure}} in which certain sets of elements are defined to be independent, {{in such a}} way that the independent sets satisfy properties modeled after the properties of linear independence in a vector space. One of the standard examples of a matroid is the graphic matroid in which the independent sets are the sets of edges in forests of a graph; the matroid structure of forests is important in algorithms for computing the minimum spanning tree of the graph. Analogously, we may define matroids from pseudoforests.|$|E

5|$|A set of {{elements}} under two binary operations, + and −, {{is called a}} Euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring R and, roughly speaking, if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them. The two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic; rather, they can be more general, such as the operations of <b>a</b> <b>mathematical</b> group or monoid. Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity.|$|E

She developed <b>a</b> <b>mathematical</b> model for the structure of nuclear shells, for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, which she shared with J. Hans D.

5|$|Another {{important}} theoretical {{idea that}} {{plays a role}} in M-theory is supersymmetry. This is <b>a</b> <b>mathematical</b> relation that exists in certain physical theories between a class of particles called bosons and a class of particles called fermions. Roughly speaking, fermions are the constituents of matter, while bosons mediate interactions between particles. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa. When supersymmetry is imposed as a local symmetry, one automatically obtains a quantum mechanical theory that includes gravity. Such a theory is called a supergravity theory.|$|E
