The focus of the research in this area has been in two directions: first, building an efficient routing infrastructure, and secondly, building a sophisticated security infrastructure.

However, security with the key management for such protocols re-mains a significant problem. In this paper, a secure group key agreement over decentralized systems is proposed.

40|$|Under PAM Form of Contract 2006, the Architect is {{empowered}} to issue various notices and instructions. As {{stated in the}} form of contract, all notices must b e communicated, sent out or delivered by hand, mail or facsimile transmission. Any notice which is sent out by means other than that stated in the contract may b e rendered as not valid, as such the receiver can choose to ignore it. But in today's advanced electronic environment, most Architects' communicate or sent out their notices b y using e-mails - a method which is not mentioned in the contract. Does this mean the notices are ineffective or inoperative? This may not b e so, because with the passing of Electronic Commerce Act 2006, the Architect may now send out or issue the related notices b y using e-mail. Section 3 (2) of the Acts provides that e-mail can b e used as a means of communication between contracting parties, if they consented to it b y conduct. But there are several issues that need to b e looked into - will the use of e-mail satisfies PAM 2006 notice requirement, i. e. written notice, <b>authentication</b> <b>of</b> e-mail sender, <b>recipient</b> and address, electronic signatures, time notices deemed served, received and acknowledgement receipt? The main aim of this research is to identify the issues associated with communicating Architect e-mail notices under PAM 2006. This research focuses on PAM 2006 Architect notice and selected commercial cases from the United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore. The methodology for this research is data analysis. This research found, Electronic Commerce Act 2006, allows the Architect to use e-mail as means to communicate related notice, provided consent was obtained by conduct. E-mail notices must satisfy PAM 2006 notice requirements for it to b e rendered valid.

40|$|Providing {{authentication}} {{mechanisms for}} IP-Multicast streams is paramount {{for the development}} of large scale commercial multicast content delivery applications. This need is particularly strong for the delivery of real time content, such as live video/audio news events or financial stock quote distribution. However, this {{turns out to be a}} quite challenging problem for many reasons. First, the <b>authentication</b> <b>of</b> the multicast data must be verifiable by a potentially very large number <b>of</b> untrusted <b>recipients.</b> Second, since multicast communication protocols are almost always best effort, the authentication mechanisms needs to authenticate received content despite the potential loss of some packets. Finally, the authentication mechanism needs to be efficient enough to cope with real time data and should have a small communication overhead. We propose a new multicast authentication scheme designed to authenticate real time multicast packet streams with a potentially unlimited number <b>of</b> <b>recipients.</b> This scheme provides both integrity and nonrepudiation of origin, and in a majority of situations, it performs with less overhead in bytes per packet than previously proposed practical real time stream authentication schemes. ...|$|R

The standardization and modernization of TCM hinge on the <b>authentication</b> <b>of</b> their botanical identities. Analysis of well-characterized marker compounds is now the most popular method for identifying the herbal materials and quality control of TCM, eg, ginsenoside profiling for <b>authentication</b> <b>of</b> Panax species. However, in many herbal species the chemical composition of the plant changes with the external environ-ment and processing conditions, which lowers the reliability <b>of</b> these <b>authentication</b> methods. In the light of the advances in molecular biotechnology in the past few decades, genetic tools are now considered to provide more standardized and reliable methods for <b>authentication</b> <b>of</b> herbal materials at the DNA level. These genetic tools include random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), DNA fingerprinting using multi-loci probes, restriction frag-ment length polymorphism (RFLP), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), and microsatellite marker technology. The practicality of these methods varies in terms of their sensitivity, reliability, reproducibility, an...|$|R
