One such type of device for accomplishing this is the photovoltaic converter. This paper reviews photovoltaic converters and their <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>conversion</b> of monochromatic laser power to electrical power. Laser power densities greater than 1000 W/sq cm are considered. For a converter operated at 300 K a lower bandgap limit of 0. 67 eV (1. 80 micron) is defined. For ideal conditions, an efficiency of 47. 8 percent is calculated for Nd/Liquid laser radiation incident on an Si converter. Several types of photovoltaic converters are discussed. Series resistance is identified as a major problem. Vertical multijunction converters are the most promising photovoltaic devices for use as laser to electric power converters...|$|E
40|$|It {{was decided}} in the De Beers v Ataqua Mining (Pty) Ltd that 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 {{tailings}} dumps 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 created by mining companies before the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, 28 of 2002 ("the MPRDA") came into operation are not governed by its provisions because such dumps are not "residue stockpiles" or "residue deposits" for purposes of the MPRDA. Ownership of tailings dumps {{is determined by the}} common law principles of accession. Ownership of a movable dump has to be transferred by one of the recognised forms of delivery of movables. Processing of these dumps will, however, still be subject to compliance with South African environmental, health and safety laws in general. It is submitted that mine dumps or tailings dumps created upon the exercise of "old order mining rights" before the commencement of the MPRDA and even after commencement of the MPRDA until eventual termination of the "old order mining rights" are not subject to the extensive, mining, environmental, empowerment provisions of the MPRDA. Termination of "old order mining rights" takes place upon: (i) refusal of an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>conversion</b> of a mining right during (or even after) the period of transition, (ii) conversion into and registration of new order mining rights during (or even after) the period of transition or (iii) termination of unconverted "old order mining rights" on 30 April 2009. To the extent that this decision has made it possible to embark on a shorter and less cumbersome route in the reprocessing and eventual disappearance of most tailings dumps, it is to be welcomed from an economical, environmental, job creation and aesthetic perspective. Proposed amendments to the MPRDA to undo the impact of the De Beers decision should be carefully considered against these mentioned benefits and a possible finding that it may amount to an expropriation without compensation. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act {{introduced}} a new mining law dispensation. This Act has implications for mineral right holders. Up to 1 May 2004, the right to prospect or mine vested in the holder of the mineral right concerned under the system of private ownership {{as set out in}} the Minerals Act 50 of 1991. The 2002 Act which is premised on the principle that minerals as a natural resource are part of the natural heritage of all South Africans, eliminates the concept of private ownership of mineral rights and vests the right to prospect or mine exclusively in the state. Mineral rights were always assets in the estate of a person and were handled in the administration of the estate. The question is whether mineral rights and royalties are still assets of the estate under the 2002 Act. New applicants under the 2002 Act will have to apply directly to the state for the right to prospect and mine, regardless of the identity of the previous holder of the relevant right. Holders of existing (old order) rights will have an opportunity to ensure the ongoing validity of these rights by complying with the conversion criteria contained in the 2002 Act. New order rights issued or converted under the 2002 Act differ from old order rights insofar as their duration, transferability, mortgage ability and the royalties payable thereon. Although the new order rights are still referred to as limited real rights in article 5 of the 2002 Act, these converted rights are more restricted in content. These new order rights cannot be ceded, transferred, let, sublet, assigned, alienated or otherwise disposed of without the written consent of the minister. Except for the transitional arrangements in Schedule 2, the 2002 Act would terminate the notion and use of the vehicle of mineral rights. When comparing the new order rights to the old order rights, the question of deprivation and expropriation arises. It is not clear exactly when a claim for compensation for expropriation of property arises and what the term of the period of prescription would be. The duration of the new prospecting right and mining right are statutorily regulated. In drawing a comparison between the old order and the new order rights, a distinction may be drawn between: (a) Situations where the holder of the old order right would be successful with his <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>conversion</b> to a new order right; (b) Situations where the holder of the old order right was unsuccessful with the application for a conversion of rights; (c) Situations where the holder chooses not to apply for conversions at all. Financial benefits to be derived from former mineral rights are also affected. The right to receive royalties may be protected under the constitutional property clause and a withdrawal of these rights from the private sphere and the assignment thereof to the state may represent a deprivation of property in the constitutional sense. Royalties to communities and natural persons may continue to them after the 2002 Act, but the position of legal entities and trust remain insecure. All these changes will affect the estate and the estate planning of the landowner and the holder of mineral rights. In this mini-dissertation all the important provisions regarding estate planning will receive attention. Transferability of the new order rights, royalties, and the effect of the new law on the value of property in the estate, will be looked at. Master...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a method <b>for</b> {{spectral}} <b>conversion</b> {{based on a}} grid-based (GB) approximation [19]. We express the spectral conversion process as a sequential Bayesian estimation problem of tracking the target spectrum using observed samples from the source spectrum. We propose models for evaluation of the evidence and likelihood probabilities needed for the GB formulation. Using these approximated probabilities, the algorithm sequentially evaluates the converted spectrum as a weighted sum of the target training vectors. Recently, we presented a similar method using GB approximation which requires phonetic labeling during the test stage [20]. In this paper, we propose {{a modified version of}} this method, which does not require any labeling for testing. Additionally, as in TC-INCA [13], we use context vectors instead of single vectors in order to improve the estimation of the likelihood probability. Altogether, we present here a more thorough description of the GB approximation method and its modified <b>application</b> <b>for</b> voice <b>conversion</b> under low resources constraints, followed by an extended analysis and detailed results.|$|R
