40|$|This paper gives a broad {{overview}} {{of the evolution of}} Belgian <b>aid</b> policies throughout the 1990 s.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} <b>aid</b> {{bombardment}} which often occurs in priority issues of <b>aid</b> to developing countries, and aims {{to find the}} most effective and feasible modality to resolve <b>aid</b> bombardment.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the empirics of <b>aid</b> and growth by investigating whether <b>aid</b> modality matters in explaining its effectiveness. For this purpose, we include the four main <b>aid</b> modalities (project <b>aid,</b> financial programme <b>aid,</b> technical assistance grants and food <b>aid)</b> as explanatory variables in an endogenous growth model. Using the GMM-SYS approach to dynamic panel estimator we test the three main competing specifications in the <b>aid</b> and growth literature for a sample of <b>aid</b> recipient countries over the 1974 - 2001 period. We find that project <b>aid</b> exerts a positive and significant impact on growth, thus casting doubt on the so-called “micromacro paradox”. Our results also show that financial programme <b>aid</b> generally impacts on growth negatively, while the impact of non-financial <b>aid,</b> technical assistance grants and food <b>aid,</b> is statistically insignificant. We found, however, no {{evidence to suggest that}} policy enhances the growth effect of the <b>aid</b> categories.

40|$|The paper uses an <b>aid</b> {{disaggregation}} {{approach to}} {{examine the impact of}} different <b>aid</b> modalities on the fiscal sector of the aid-recipient country. It uses time-series data on different types of development <b>aid</b> (project <b>aid,</b> programme <b>aid,</b> technical assistance and food <b>aid)</b> for Uganda, an important <b>aid</b> recipient in recent years, to estimate a model of fiscal response in the presence of <b>aid</b> which combines <b>aid</b> heterogeneity and endogenous <b>aid.</b> The empirical findings clearly suggest the importance of the above approach for delving deeper into <b>aid</b> effectiveness issues since different <b>aid</b> categories have different effects on key fiscal variables-an impact that could not be revealed if a single figure for <b>aid</b> were employed. Project and food <b>aids</b> appear to cause a reduction in public investment whereas programme <b>aid</b> and technical assistance are positively related to public investment. The same applies for government consumption. A negligible impact on government tax and non-tax revenues, and a strong displacement of government borrowing are also found.

40|$|How does {{respect for}} human rights affect the {{disbursement}} of food <b>aid</b> by US foreign policymakers? Scholars analyzing foreign <b>aid</b> generally look at only total economic <b>aid,</b> military <b>aid</b> or a combination of both. However, for a more nuanced understanding of human rights as a determinant of foreign <b>aid,</b> the discrete foreign <b>aid</b> programs must be examined. By disentangling component-programs from total <b>aid,</b> this analysis demonstrates how human rights influence policymakers by allowing them to distribute food <b>aid</b> to human rights abusing countries. Consequently, policymakers can promote strategic objectives with food <b>aid,</b> while legally restricted from distributing other <b>aid.</b> The primary theoretical argument, which links increasing human rights abuse with increasing food <b>aid,</b> is supported by results from a Heckman model. This procedure models the two-stage decision-making process where foreign policymakers first, select countries for <b>aid</b> and then, distribute <b>aid</b> to those selected. i...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the fungibility of foreign <b>aid</b> and makes three {{contributions to the}} existing literature. Firstly, fungibility of <b>aid</b> at the aggregate level is reexamined on a richer panel dataset of 91 developing countries for 1980 - 2009, taking into account endogeneity of <b>aid</b> and autocorrelation in residuals. Results indicate that <b>aid</b> is strongly fungible: around 80 % is substituting rather than increasing government spending in the short run. There is also substantial heterogeneity in the sample, with <b>aid</b> being more fungible for countries with a low share of <b>aid</b> in GDP. Secondly, <b>aid</b> is disaggregated into bilateral and multilateral components. Despite substantial differences between both components, there are only very small indications that multilateral <b>aid</b> is less fungible than bilateral <b>aid</b> and estimates are volatile when <b>aid</b> is instrumented. Thirdly, this study attempts to distinguish between off- and on-budget <b>aid</b> at the aggregate level using the value of technical cooperation {{as a proxy for}} off-budget <b>aid.</b> While on-budget <b>aid</b> is strongly fungible, off-budget <b>aid</b> is non-fungible. In the long run, around 50 % of <b>aid</b> increases government expenditures, although results are not stable. High levels of fungibility (except for off-budget <b>aid)</b> suggest that resources spent on earmarking may be wasted and donors should rethink the way <b>aid</b> is distributed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{does not}} address the issue of <b>aid</b> {{effectiveness}} [...] that is, the extent to which foreign <b>aid</b> dollars actually achieve their goals [...] but on "best practices" {{in the way in which}} official <b>aid</b> is given, an important component of the wider debate. First we discuss best practice for an ideal <b>aid</b> agency and the difficulties that <b>aid</b> agencies face because they are typically not accountable to their intended beneficiaries. Next we consider the transparency of <b>aid</b> agencies and four additional dimensions of <b>aid</b> practice: specialization, or the degree to which <b>aid</b> is not fragmented among too many donors, too many countries, and too many sectors for each donor); selectivity, or the extent to which <b>aid</b> avoids corrupt autocrats and goes to the poorest countries; use of ineffective <b>aid</b> channels such as tied <b>aid,</b> food <b>aid,</b> and technical assistance; and the overhead costs of <b>aid</b> agencies. We compare 48 <b>aid</b> agencies along these dimensions, distinguishing between bilateral and multilateral ones. Using the admittedly limited information we have, we rank the <b>aid</b> agencies on different dimensions of <b>aid</b> practice and then provide one final comprehensive ranking.
