40|$|The main aim of {{the paper}} is to analyse the {{elasticity}} of labour demand in Poland in the main economic sectors (agriculture, industry, construction and services) in 1995 - 2003. On the basis of economic theory {{it is assumed that}} the chief factors determining labour demand are: real wages (neoclassical factor) and the <b>agregate</b> demand (keynesian factor). The researches undertaken should answer the question which of these factors had the gratest impact on the level of labour demand. The analyses provided in the paper shows that the most important factor determining the level of labour demand was the <b>agregate</b> demand. The elasticity of labour demand in respect to <b>agregate</b> demand was differenciated in particular economic sectors. The highest elasticity was noted in the services sector. The growth of real wage could be the factor which limited the growth of employment in industrial and construction sectors. In these sectors the growth of real wages was higher than the growth of labour productivity. The changes in the sectoral structure of employment are of positive direction according the three sectors theory. We could noticed the increase in the employment share in the services sector and fall in employment share in the agriculture and industrial sector. These changes should lead to increase the economic growth rate in Poland.
