It describes how humans contribute to accidents, and pays special attention to the assurance of process safety assurance, which is in part realized by timely reactions to system alarms. An experiment involving an operator´s reaction times to alarm signals was undertaken to investigate whether there are differential responses to visual as opposed to auditory alarms.

Bharucha et al., {{the problem}} of femtocell to macrocell interference for the downlink in LTE is addressed through dynamic resource partitioning, where femtocells are denied access to radio resources used by macro-UEs in their vicinity. The proposed coordination is achieved by using the downlink high interference <b>indicator</b> <b>messages</b> that are configured based on macro-UE measurements and sent by the eNB over the wireline backbone to HeNBs if required. It is demonstrated through simulations that in the investigated closed-access femtocell scenario the capacity of affected macro-UEs in vicinity of a femtocell can be increased by up to tenfold for a sacrifice of 4 % of the overall femtocell downlink capacity.|$|R

40|$|Objective/backgroundTo {{conduct a}} {{comprehensive}} review of cases, presentation, diagnosis, and management of angiosarcoma in arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) created for haemodialysis. MethodsTwo authors independently conducted systematic searches and extraction of articles from the Embase, AMED, Health Management Information Consortium, and MEDLINE databases in keeping with the inclusion/exclusion criteria and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses standards. ResultsTwenty-two unique patient cases were identified; 20 of the cases were men and mean ± SD age of presentation was 54. 9  ±  13. 6 years. Nineteen cases were post-transplant and 18 were on antirejection agents. The most common presenting symptom was pain, with or without a mass. The initial diagnosis was most often thrombosis/infection of the AVF and the diagnostic interval to a correct diagnosis of angiosarcoma was between 2 and 40 weeks. Mean ± SD time to presentation of symptoms from fistula formation was 118. 9  ±  57. 5 months, while from transplant it was 96. 9  ±  70. 0 months. Amputation was the most common treatment modality and mean ± SD survival was 8. 8  ±  3. 7 months. ConclusionAngiosarcoma should be suspected in previously quiescent AVF that presents with pain. The presence of a rapidly enlarging mass or bleeding/bruising should be taken as <b>alarm</b> <b>indicators</b> and warrant urgent investigation in accordance with local cancer guidelines.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Physical {{activity}} (PA) promotion {{is one of}} {{the most}} important factors in prevention of non-infectious civilization diseases. Other factors that may affect PA (economical, environmental, socio-cultural, etc.) are intensively monitored in relation to the quality of life. Regionally related conditions for the realization of leisure PA can improve the differences in the level of PA in different population groups. AIMS: The aim of this study was to analyze physical activity of the population of the Eastern Bohemian region (Hradec Králové, Pardubice and Vysočina) regarding the education and socioeconomic status. METHODS: Term "Eastern Bohemian" region was used to sum the data collected from regions of Hradec Králové, Pardubice and Vysočina. To determine the weekly level of PA we used a randomized data set of 1273 people from the Eastern Bohemian region (555 men and 718 women) aged 41. 03 &# 177; 9. 16 years. All respondents were asked personally by educated distributors (university students) to participate in a research study using the Czech version of the IPAQ questionnaire. Data collection was carried out regularly in Spring (March-May) and Autumn (September-November) period from 2005 to 2009. RESULTS: People with higher education (university degree) have a lower amount of weekly PA than people with lower type of education (primary and secondary). People with secondary school education reported the highest amount of realized PA. There is diversified socioeconomic status (SES) in the Eastern Bohemian region. People with higher SES reported a lower level of realized PA than people with lower SES. CONCLUSIONS: The high loss of PA in university educated population is an <b>alarming</b> <b>indicator</b> of possible health complications. This group should be targeted in prevention health programs. Natural attractiveness should be maintained and opportunities made available for the realization of cultural, cycling and hiking trips. Programs motivating local people to carry out leisure PA should be adapted...|$|R
