However, human beings recognize what they utter partly through <b>acoustic</b> <b>echoes</b> when they speak. In {{order to examine}} the feasibility of {{the achievement of the}} two opposite elements in a recording room, small <b>acoustic</b> <b>echoes</b> for accurate recordings and moderate echoes for natural utterances, this article set up a simplified anechoic room up to a room in Architectural Acoustic Lab. and assessed its performance. The reverberation time and the distance decay loss of sound pressure level were used as the evaluation indicators. The result showed that the reverberation time was longer than that of anechoic room, so that the speaker can utter more naturally in the recording room. However, the reverberation time was also short enough for blocking the influence of echoes. The effect of distance decay loss of the sound pressure level on the recordings was ignorable when the microphone was placed within 1. 0 meter long from the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s mouth. These results suggest that a recording room with the 2 opposite elements, small <b>acoustic</b> <b>echoes</b> for accurate recordings and moderate echoes for natural utterances, is realistic...|$|R

Extracting the 3 D geometry plays {{an important part in}} scene understanding. Recently, robust visual descriptors are proposed for extracting the indoor scene layout from a passive agent’s perspective, specifically from a single image. Their robustness is mainly due to modelling the physical interaction of the underlying room geometry with the objects and the humans present in the room.

40|$|In {{handsfree}} tele- or video-communication, <b>acoustic</b> <b>echoes</b> arise due to {{the coupling}} between the loudspeakers and microphones. It is much more challenging to remove the undesired <b>acoustic</b> <b>echoes</b> for stereo or multi-channel tele-communication systems than for mono systems {{due to the}} non-uniqueness problem. While non-uniqueness can be prevented by introducing independent distortions into {{the left and right}} loudspeaker signals, stereo echo cancellation is more challenging in terms of convergence speed and computational complexity than mono echo cancellation. The proposed stereo echo control algorithm circumvents the non-uniqueness problem by using simplified echo path models consisting of delays and short-time spectral modification. It is shown that for reasonably symmetric systems the left and right echo path models are similar enough that a single echo path model can be used for estimating the total echo power spectrum and a gain filter for removing the echo from the microphone channels. The proposed algorithm is also applicable to multi-channel systems and the computational complexity is very low. 1...|$|R

The thunderstorm outflow of 27 June 1972 is found to compare with in most respects to Charba's gust front model.
