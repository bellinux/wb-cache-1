5|$|Despite her {{relative}} inexperience, Leigh {{was chosen}} to play Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet in an Old Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, Denmark. Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him before suddenly becoming silent <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> into space. She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had returned to normal with no recollection of the event. It {{was the first time}} Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting {{opposite}} each other at a table, tapping their hands <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> at one and other. As the songs audio begins to play, band members of Maroon 5 start to play their instruments as Rihanna sits and watches them. The table and band scenes are intercut with each other for the first verse and chorus. For the second verse, Levine and Rihanna appear to argue and try to ignore the other's advances. Rihanna lays suggestively on a bed while Levine sits on a chair with his head turned in the opposite direction for the bridge. For the final chorus, the pair appear to reconcile, ending with Levine finally giving in to his temptations and walk {{to the end of the}} table where Rihanna sits and he caresses her neck causing Rihanna to lean towards him seductively and the two nearly kiss as the video ends. The video was made available to download digitally via iTunes on May 12, 2008.|$|E

Wiglaf sees the golden horn washed by {{the waves of}} the sea in the sand while Grendel's mother floats in the sea, looking at him seductively. The movie ends ambiguously with Wiglaf holding the horn <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> back at her, leaving his fate unknown.|$|E

25|$|The {{class was}} filled with people wanting {{to learn more about}} Buddhism, and the {{presence}} of a Zen master was inspiring for them. Suzuki had the class do zazen for 20 minutes, sitting on the floor without a zafu <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> forward at the white wall. In closing, Suzuki invited everyone to stop in at Sokoji for morning zazen. Little by little, more people showed up each week to sit zazen for 40 minutes with Suzuki on mornings. The students were improvising, using cushions borrowed from wherever they could find them.|$|E
25|$|As {{it turned}} out, it was. Brett Lee, opening the bowling for Australia, {{started off with}} a maiden over to Trescothick, and England {{struggled}} {{to get off the}} mark, being four for no wicket after three overs. Another maiden from Glenn McGrath followed, and then Andrew Strauss departed with an inside edge off Lee. In the next over, Trescothick was gone for a 15-ball duck, to an away-swinger from McGrath, and two balls later Paul Collingwood gave a massive inside-edge onto his stumps – England were six for three, <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> down the barrel.|$|E
25|$|Yellowcard {{promoted}} Paper Walls nonstop {{after its}} release and started touring {{to support the}} album. The group supported Blue October during the band's United States 2007 fall tour and also supported Linkin Park in Japan in November/December 2007. While touring for Paper Walls, Peter Mosely announced in a Myspace blog message {{that he would be}} leaving Yellowcard to pursue other endeavors, moving back to Jacksonville and rejoining his old band. Josh Portman from the bands Near Miss <b>and</b> <b>Staring</b> Back took over on bass until the reformation of Yellowcard in 2010, upon which Sean O'Donnell of Reeve Oliver became the bass player.|$|E

25|$|When a {{fire engine}} drove within range, Huberty {{repeatedly}} pierced the vehicle with bullets, {{but did not}} wound any occupants. Hearing a wounded teenager, 19-year-old Jose Pérez, moaning, Huberty fatally {{shot him in the}} head; the boy slumped dead in the booth. Pérez died alongside his friend and neighbor, 22-year-old Gloria González, and a young woman named Michelle Carncross. At one point, Aurora Peña, who had lain wounded beside her dead aunt, baby cousin and two friends, noted a lull in the firing. Opening her eyes, she saw Huberty nearby <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> at her. He swore and threw a bag of french fries at her, then retrieved his shotgun and shot her in the arm, neck, and chest. She survived, although she would be hospitalized longer than any other survivor. Occasionally, Huberty blurted justifications before murdering his victims as he shot them.|$|E
25|$|Van Norren et al. (1998) {{could not}} find a single example in the medical {{literature}} of a <1nbsp&mW classnbsp&III laser causing eyesight damage. Mainster et al. (2003) provide one case, an 11-year-old child who temporarily damaged her eyesight by holding an approximately 5mW red laser pointer close to the eye <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> into the beam for 10 seconds, she experienced scotoma (a blind spot) but fully recovered after three months. Luttrull & Hallisey (1999) describe a similar case, a 34-year-old male who stared into the beam of a classIIIa 5mW red laser for 30 to 60 seconds, causing temporary central scotoma and visual field loss. His eyesight fully recovered within two days, {{at the time of his}} eye exam. An intravenous fundus fluorescein angiogram, a technique used by ophthalmologists to visualise the retina of the eye in fine detail, identified subtle discoloration of the fovea.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 NRL season saw Mini {{return to}} the field after a re-occurrence of his back injury put him out for the back half of the 2007 season. Unfortunately, during a round 4 clash with the Canterbury Bulldogs, pain in his back returned. This {{severely}} harmed his chances of regaining his Australian fullback jersey and he was overlooked in favour of both Brett Stewart and Melbourne Storm fullback Billy Slater. Stewart and Slater were also the respective fullbacks for NSW and Qld at the time. In 2009, Anthony played 2 games before injuring his ankle against the Canberra Raiders. He was sidelined until Round 20; by then, the Roosters were in deep trouble <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> down of their worst season since failing to win a single game in 1966. Eventually, the Roosters finished last on the NRL ladder, completing a spectacular downfall from {{the first half of}} the decade in which the Sydney Roosters were dominant, but had only one NRL Premiership to show for it.|$|E

500|$|Sage keeps a [...] boat (called Muriel) in real life, as {{does the}} {{character}} Sally Mullin in Magyk. Other inspirations for the series included Sage's love {{of history and the}} misty landscape of Cornwall, where she lived before starting the series. Another factor {{in the development of the}} series was her love of daydreaming: [...] "Slowly ... lots of thinking, and daydreaming. I am a big fan of daydreaming <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> out of the window. Then keeping all my thoughts and ideas in a dog-eared old envelope for ages." [...] With The Wilton Villager, Sage further expanded her inspiration behind the series.|$|E

500|$|Ixtlan del Rio. [...] These {{abstract}} figurines have flat, squarish {{bodies with}} highly stylized faces complete with nose rings and multiple earrings. [...] Seated figurines have thin rope-like limbs while the standing figurines have short stocky limbs. [...] One {{of the first}} styles to be described, noted ethnographer, and caricaturist Miguel Covarrubias stated that it [...] "reaches the limits of absurd, brutal caricature, a peculiar aesthetic concept that relishes the creation of haunting subhuman monstrosities". [...] Art historian George Kubler finds that [...] "the square bodies, grimacing mouths, <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> eyes convey a disturbing expression which is only in part resolved by the animation and plastic energy of the turgid forms".|$|E

500|$|As Prince Gian Gastone disliked his father's hyper-pious character, he {{elected to}} stay away from him and the royal court. The closed court that Gian Gastone did keep was {{dominated}} by his favourite, Dami. Meanwhile, the Grand Prince Ferdinando was slowly dying from syphilis, making Gian Gastone's immediate succession more likely. Ferdinando, nonetheless, was not alone in his suffering: Guyot de Merville, a French adventurer, took note of Gian Gastone's mental decline: [...] "He carries [...] so far that it is said he never opens a letter, to avoid having to answer." [...] Additionally, Gian Gastone's fragile temperament required long periods of isolation; he spent several hours alone each night, drinking <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> up at the moon.|$|E
500|$|The Ameca style, {{associated}} with Jalisco, {{is characterized by}} an elongated face and a high forehead which is often capped by braids or turban-like headgear. The aquiline nose is also elongated and the large eyes are wide <b>and</b> <b>staring,</b> with pronounced rims created by adding separate strips of clay ("fillets") around the eyes. [...] The wide mouth is closed or slightly opened and the large hands have carefully delineated nails. [...] Kubler detects both an early [...] "sheep-faced" [...] style that seem [...] "eroded or melted in the continuous passages of modelling that unite rather than divide {{the parts of the}} body" [...] and a later style which are [...] "more animated and more incisively articulated".|$|E
500|$|Forced {{to cancel}} Pink Floyd's {{appearance}} at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, {{as well as several}} other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused {{to come out of the}} car. A stay in Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October. As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse. During appearances on the Dick Clark and Pat Boone shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by not responding to questions <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> off into space. He refused to move his lips when it came time to mime [...] "See Emily Play" [...] on Boone's show. After these embarrassing episodes, King ended their US visit and immediately sent them home to London. Soon after their return, they supported Jimi Hendrix during a tour of England; however, Barrett's depression worsened as the tour continued, reaching a crisis point in December, when the band responded by adding a new member to their line-up.|$|E

500|$|The video {{features}} Carey readying for her wedding, {{and follows}} {{her to the}} altar, {{as well as her}} escape from the reception. [...] Many of the actors featured in Carey's [...] "It's Like That" [...] video were in that of [...] "We Belong Together", which was shot as a continuation from the [...] "It's Like That" [...] video. It begins with a scene of a large mansion, apparently owned by the older man who she is to marry. Carey is seen walking barefoot in a room, shedding a black sheer robe and laying down on a bed draped with white linens. Dressed in lingerie, Carey's face is shown close-up, as scenes of her tossing in the bed are shown. As the song begins, Carey is seen sitting in front of a large mirror, preparing for her wedding by putting on earrings and shoes, <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> at the ring on her finger. Additional scenes of Carey sitting on a small blue sofa, wearing a purple dress, and Carey staring at the camera during a shower moment are interspersed. The wedding is then shown, with Miller approaching the reception through a stairwell in the back. Small children as seen throwing flowers on the white carpet, followed by Roberts and Carey walking down the aisle.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} Carey walking down some {{steps onto the}} beach wearing a black bathing suit and high heel shoes, which she takes off when she gets {{to the bottom and}} walks onto the sand. Carey is seen in {{different}} shots standing next to a cliff-face {{as well as in the}} middle of the beach for the majority of the video. For the bridge, Carey is seen in multiple different shots as she walks along the shoreline, which changes as the last verse takes place, where her outfit changes from a black bathing suit to a different style white bathing suit whilst the sun sets in the background. As the video comes to an end, the scenery has changed to nighttime, and Carey is wearing another black bathing suit with a black jacket standing against a rock-face. Carey then inscribes into the sand [...] "H.A.T.E.U." [...] using her fingers, which she underlines as the video fades to black. The video is also inter-cut throughout with shots of the scenery on the beach. Rap-Up described the video as [...] "picturesque". Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that it is a [...] "slow-mo, beachwear fashion show". He continued, [...] "Equally depressed by the end of a relationship and inspired by the scenery, Mimi spends a few minutes suggestively touching herself <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> into the middle distance. What becomes of the broken-hearted?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Always Be My Baby" [...] {{was the second}} video Carey's directed. In it, she is the {{seemingly}} happy narrator of a tale of young love, {{as a young boy}} and a girl elope {{in the middle of the}} night. The video was filmed on location at Carey's sponsored charity, the Fresh Air Fund upstate New York camp. The video begins with scenes of Carey on a lakeside tire-swing, smiling and beginning to retell a story of young love. As she sits upon the swing, scenes of two children sneaking out of their bungalow in the middle of the night are shown. They frolic together beside a fireplace, soon coming up to the lakeside swing Carey had been on before. They soon go swimming wearing their clothes, much like Carey did in her video for [...] "Dreamlover" [...] though she does not jump into the water herself this time. As they jump into the water, Carey is then seen by the campfire they passed on their journey to the lake, smiling with friends and enjoying herself by the fire. Eventually the boy and girl are seen kissing underwater. The video concludes with scenes of the young boy and girl walking together back to their bungalow, walking hand-in-hand. Having possibly witnessed the entire event, Carey is seen once again by the large swing, chuckling <b>and</b> <b>staring</b> into the night's sky.|$|E
