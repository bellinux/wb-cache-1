25|$|The {{other is}} doing {{experiments}} with few-cycle pulses, like above-threshold ionization, <b>attosecond</b> pulses, highly efficient nonlinear optics or high-harmonics generation. This can be single pulses, {{so that no}} comb exists, and therefore {{it is not possible}} to define a carrier–envelope offset frequency, rather the carrier–envelope offset phase is important. A second photodiode can be added to the setup to gather phase and amplitude in a single shot, or difference-frequency generation can be used to even lock the offset on a single-shot basis, albeit with low power efficiency.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme that {{combines}} the echo-enabled harmonic generation technique with the bunch compression and allows to generate harmonic numbers {{of a few}} hundred in a microbunched beam through up-conversion of the frequency of an ultraviolet seed laser. Sending this beam through a short undulator results in an isolated sub- 100 <b>attoseconds</b> pulse of x-ray radiation. Using a representative realistic set of parameters, we show that 1 nm x-ray pulse with peak power exceeding 100 MW and duration as short as 34 <b>attoseconds</b> (FWHM) can be generated from a 200 nm ultraviolet seed laser...|$|R
25|$|It {{was later}} {{claimed by the}} Keller group in Switzerland that {{particle}} tunneling does indeed occur in zero real time. Their tests involved tunneling electrons, where the group argued a relativistic prediction for tunneling time should be 500-600 attoseconds (an <b>attosecond</b> is one quintillionth (1018) of a second). All that could be measured was 24 attoseconds, which is the limit of the test accuracy. Again, though, other physicists believe that tunneling experiments in which particles appear to spend anomalously short times inside the barrier are in fact fully compatible with relativity, although there is disagreement about whether the explanation involves reshaping of the wave packet or other effects.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{specialized}} literature, [...] "ultrashort" [...] {{refers to the}} femtosecond (fs) and picosecond (ps) range, although such pulses no longer hold {{the record for the}} shortest pulses artificially generated.

50|$|An <b>attosecond</b> is 1×10−18 of {{a second}} (one quintillionth {{of a second}}). For context, an <b>attosecond</b> is to a second what a second is to about 31.71 billion years.|$|E
50|$|A {{femtosecond}} {{is equal}} to 1000 <b>attoseconds,</b> or 1/1000 picosecond. Because the next higher SI unit is 1000 times larger, times of 10−14 and 10−13 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of femtoseconds.|$|R

40|$|Photoionization from energetically {{distinct}} electronic {{states may}} have a relative time delay of tens of <b>attoseconds.</b> Here we demonstrate that pulses of optical vortices allow measuring such <b>attoseconds</b> delays from magnetic sublevels, even from a spherically symmetric target. The difference in the time delay is substantial and exhibits a strong angular dependence. Furthermore, we find an atomic scale variation in the time delays depending on the target orbital position in the laser spot. The findings offer thus a qualitatively new way for a spatio-temporal sensing of the magnetic states from which the photoelectrons originate, with a spatial resolution way below the diffraction limit of the vortex beam. Our conclusions follow from analytical considerations based on symmetry, complemented and confirmed with full numerical simulations of the quantum dynamics. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

The control of the wave form of the femtosecond pulse demonstrated by Ferenc Krausz and his team and the resulting reproducible <b>attosecond</b> pulses enabled the establishment of the <b>attosecond</b> measuring technique as the technological basis for experimental <b>attosecond</b> physics today. Over the past few years, Ferenc Krausz and his coworkers succeeded with these tools to control electrons in molecules and - for the first time - observe in real time a large number of fundamental electron processes such as tunneling, charge transport, coherent EUV emission, delayed photoelectric effect, valence electron movement and the control of the optical and electrical properties of dielectrics.
