50|$|<b>Alizapride</b> (Litican, Plitican, Superan, Vergentan) is a {{dopamine}} antagonist with prokinetic and antiemetic effects used in {{the treatment}} of nausea and vomiting, including postoperative nausea and vomiting. It is structurally related to metoclopramide and other benzamides.|$|E
50|$|Benzotriazole {{derivatives}} have {{chemical and}} biological properties that are versatile in the pharmaceutical industry. Benzotriazole derivatives act as agonists for many proteins. For instance, vorozole and <b>alizapride</b> have useful inhibitory properties against different proteins and benzotriazole esters {{have been reported to}} work as mechanism-based inactivators for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 3CL protease. The methodology is not only limited to heterocyclization but was also successful for polynuclear hydrocarbons of small carbocyclic systems.|$|E
40|$|<b>Alizapride</b> is a {{substituted}} benzamide, which, when administered postoperatively, is {{very active}} {{in the prevention of}} postoperative nausea and vomiting. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the possibility of increasing the efficacy of treatment with <b>alizapride</b> in patients undergoing middle ear surgery, which is known to be a highly emetic procedure. Therefore, in a double-blind study versus placebo, we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of adding a preoperative and intraoperative treatment with <b>alizapride</b> to the normal postoperative treatment. This study showed that there was no difference in the incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients without preoperative preloading with <b>alizapride</b> compared with patients with drug preloading. We therefore conclude that postoperative preventive treatment with <b>alizapride</b> is a highly effective procedure for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing middle ear surgery.

40|$|<b>Alizapride</b> 50 mg {{intravenously}} {{was compared}} with placebo in a double-blind trial on 170 women undergoing planned soft tissue surgery under general anesthesia. <b>Alizapride</b> or placebo was given intravenously about 20 {{minutes before the}} end of the operation. A second and a third prophylactic dose was administered 4 and 8 hours after the first injection. The patients were observed for 24 hours postoperatively. A therapeutic dose of <b>alizapride</b> 50 mg was administered intravenously in the two groups if retching or emesis occurred in the postoperative period. In the <b>alizapride</b> group there was less retching or emesis than in the placebo-group and the difference was statistically significant. However, there was still a significant incidence of 34 % of postoperative vomiting in the <b>alizapride</b> group. There were no effects on heart rate or on respiratory rate but small changes of blood pressure after the first and second prophylactic injection of <b>alizapride</b> have been noted. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alizapride</b> is a methoxy- 2 -benzamide {{derivative}} {{three times}} more potent than its parent compound, metoclopramide, as an antagonist of apomorphine-induced emesis in dogs. The antiemetic activity of <b>alizapride</b> plus dexamethasone (DXM) was {{compared with that of}} placebo plus DXM in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in cancer patients receiving cisplatin (DDP). <b>Alizapride,</b> given at the maximally tolerated dose of 4 mg/kg x 5, or placebo was given in a sequence determined by randomization during two successive, identical courses of antitumor chemotherapy. The antiemetic treatment was given 30 min before and 1. 5, 3. 5, 5. 5, and 7. 5 h after starting. DXM, in a dose of 12 mg, was given IV with the first administration of <b>alizapride</b> or placebo. A total of 39 patients completed the two courses of chemotherapy. The severity of gastrointestinal symptoms was influenced by previous treatment but not by the treatment sequence. Although our overall results suggest that <b>alizapride</b> does not add to the activity of DXM against DDP-induced amesis, a statistically significant difference favoring <b>alizapride</b> plus DXM was found among patients with the lowest gastrointestinal tolerance to DDP: women, patients under 50 years of age, and patients pretreated with chemotherapy including DDP and non-DDP agents. Side effects consisted of orthostatic hypotension, which was symptomatic in two patients, and a single occurrence of severe extrapyramidal syndrome. We conclude that <b>alizapride</b> is more active than placebo when combined with DXM for DDP-induced emesis in patients at high risk of severe nausea and vomiting. The severity of the side effects in this study indicates that a dose reduction of <b>alizapride</b> might be appropriate for further studies. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alizapride</b> {{in a new}} methoxy- 2 benzamide {{derivative}} with antiemetic properties. The {{dose-effect relationship}} of this compound was studied in 24 cancer patients treated with cis-platin regimens. <b>Alizapride</b> was administered as 15 min intravenous infusions at doses of 1 to 5 mg/kg repeated every 2 hours for 3 administrations. No adverse reactions were noted at doses of 1 to 3 mg/kg. Serious orthostatic hypertension was observed at the highest dose level. Other side effects were essentially mild to moderate and consisted of somnolence and diarrhea. The study indicated that the dosage level of 4 mg/kg is suitable for clinical use. The antiemetic activity of <b>alizapride</b> in patients receiving cis-platin therapy remains to the firmly established in a randomized study. This trial suggested a better antiemetic effect of <b>alizapride</b> in naive patients as compared to those previously treated with anticancer chemotherapy.

Anti-emetic responses in terms of control of vomiting episodes were similar in both regimens (59 %). However, patients showed a statistically significant preference for high dose metoclopramide (P = 0. 02). Side effects of both regimens were minimal.

40|$|A {{series of}} studies {{was carried out in}} infants and {{children}} suffering from gastro-oesophageal reflux to assess the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of <b>alizapride,</b> a recently developed dopaminergic-receptor blocker. Investigational techniques such as manometry, pH monitoring, endoscopy and scintigraphy were used to evaluate a prokinetic activity of the drug and its effects on oesophageal and gastric motility when given by the intravenous and oral routes. Preliminary findings indicate that <b>alizapride</b> had a significant effect on lower oesophageal sphincter pressure and peristaltic wave amplitude, but the evidence for an effect on gastric motility was less clear. Long-term treatment with oral <b>alizapride</b> (usually in a dosage of 5 mg/kg/day) suggests that it produced marked symptomatic improvement and was very well tolerated in the majority of the patients studied. A double-blind controlled trial is now in progress to provide more objective evidence of the usefulness of <b>alizapride</b> in the management of digestive tract motor disorders in paediatric patients.

40|$|Two-hundred {{patients}} {{scheduled for}} elective thyroidectomy under halothane-nitrous-oxide-oxygen anaesthesia were randomly {{divided into two}} equal groups and were blindly given either <b>alizapride</b> 100 mg i. v. or a placebo before induction of anaesthesia and every 4 h thereafter for 20 h. Occurrence of nausea or vomiting were recorded after each injection of the trial drug. The incidence of nausea (63. 0 % vs. 45. 8 %; P = 0. 016) and vomiting (63. 0 % vs. 41. 1 %; P = 0. 002) was significantly higher in the placebo group. No troublesome side-effects were imputed {{to the use of}} <b>alizapride.</b> Neither sex, nor clinical status, nor difficulty of tracheal intubation influenced the incidence of nausea or vomiting in this series.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the stability of}} tramadol hydrochloride 100 mg associated with <b>alizapride</b> 50 mg in 100 ml of 5 % dextrose solution stored at 5 +/- 3 degrees C. METHODS: Solutions of 5 % dextrose 100 ml in polyolefin bags (n= 5) containing approximately tramadol hydrochloride 100 mg associated with <b>alizapride</b> 50 mg were prepared under aseptic conditions and stored about 32 days at 5 +/- 3 degrees C. The tramadol hydrochloride and <b>alizapride</b> concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Visual inspection was performed and pH was measured periodically during the storage. Stability of the solutions {{was defined as the}} common regression line 95 % lower confidence limit of the concentration remaining superior to 90 % of the initial concentration as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). RESULTS: No color change or precipitation in the solutions was observed. Tramadol hydrochloride 100 mg associated with <b>alizapride</b> 50 mg in 100 ml of 5 % dextrose infusions was stable when stored at 5 +/- 3 degrees C during 32 days. Throughout this period, the lower confidence limit of the estimated regression line of concentration-time profile remained above 90 % of the initial concentration. There was no significant change in pH during storage. CONCLUSION: Under the conditions of this study, tramadol hydrochloride 100 mg associated with <b>alizapride</b> 50 mg in 100 ml of 5 % dextrose infusions stored up to 32 days at 5 +/- 3 degrees C remain stable and may be prepared in advance by a Centralized Intravenous Additive Service (CIVAS) to improve safety and management...|$|E
40|$|A double-blind, {{randomized}} crossover {{trial was}} carried out in 44 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with cis-platinum to compare the anti-emetic effectiveness and tolerance of <b>alizapride</b> and domperidone given in high dosage. Patients received 5 administrations of either 4 mg <b>alizapride</b> 1 kg body weight or 0. 6 mg domperidone/kg during a chemotherapy session and then the alternative antiemetic during the next session. Treatment order was randomized. Patients were followed-up for 12 hours and details recorded of the total time during which there was some nausea, the duration of mild and severe nausea, and the number of episodes of mild and severe vomiting. A note was also made of the duration of mild and moderate sedation, and the incidence and severity of any other side-effects either probably or possibly related to anti-emetic medication. The investigator gave an overall assessment of the severity of nausea and vomiting experienced during each chemotherapy session and an opinion on the comparative effectiveness of the two anti-emetics. At the end of the two sessions, patients were asked to state a preference, if any, for one or other treatment and to select which they would like to have for their next chemotherapy session. The results showed that whilst both <b>alizapride</b> and domperidone appeared to be equally effective in limiting mild nausea, <b>alizapride</b> was significantly better in preventing severe nausea and episodes of vomiting. In those cases where a positive choice between treatments was made, <b>alizapride</b> was considered to be significantly better than domperidone by the investigator and more patients preferred <b>alizapride</b> and would select it for their next session. Sedation, which was not considered as unpleasant, occurred during all sessions. Of the minor side-effects probably related to anti-emetic treatment, diarrhoea of moderate severity was the most frequently reported, and a few patients had hypotension; 2 patients in each group showed extrapyramidal signs. There {{was no significant difference in}} tolerance between the two groups and all these side-effects disappeared without major therapy. © 1985 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

40|$|Emesis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} and distressing adverse effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Conventional antiemetic regimens are unsatisfactory due to their poor efficacy and their adverse events, particularly in children. Tropisetron (Navoban; Sandoz Pharma Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) belongs to a new class of 5 -hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonists with antiemetic effectiveness in patients receiving anticancer agents. We evaluated tropisetron (0. 2 mg/kg/d) in 24 chemotherapy-treated children who had experienced severe emesis during previous chemotherapy courses in spite of concomitant administration of either <b>alizapride</b> or metoclopramide. Complete control of emesis was achieved in 70 % of the courses (37 % of those including cisplatin). No severe adverse effect was reported. Headache was observed in two courses and constipation was observed during two other courses. Tropisetron proved clearly superior to conventional antiemetics and safe in use.

40|$|For further {{improvements}} of postoperative outcome, prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting and adequate pain control are crucial, as these two entities remain {{the most frequent}} postoperative complications and hence also most important complaints of patients after surgery. The reduction of PONV and postoperative pain will thus have a large impact on patient well-being and satisfaction. The overall incidence of PONV after general anesthesia is still 20 - 30 % (when no adequate prophylaxis has been administered), and can reach up to 80 % in high risk patients. Occasionally, PONV can lead to aspiration pneumonia, wound dehiscence, surgical bleeding and esophageal rupture and dehydration. The real burden of PONV is the impairment of patients’ comfort. Moreover, PONV can lead to prolonged post anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay, necessitates an increase in nursing care and results in unanticipated hospital admissions following ambulatory surgery. As a result, PONV and its associated complications do increase costs. 80 % of the patients experience acute postoperative pain after surgery, of which less than 50 % receive adequate pain relief. Insufficient pain management might lead to clinical and psychological sequelae that can drastically reduce {{quality of life and}} impair recovery. Traditionally, opioids are still considered the gold standard for postoperative analgesia, but their use can cause clinically relevant, dose-limiting side effects including respiratory depression, sedation, constipation, itching, ileus, urinary retention and PONV. In an attempt to reduce opioid-related side effects, the concept of multi-modal analgesia for postoperative pain has been introduced. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate and develop new therapeutic approaches with which the incidence of the above-mentioned two major postoperative complications (i. e., PONV and pain) could be reduced and postoperative outcome be improved. We evaluated the efficacy of two established drugs (<b>alizapride</b> and lidocaine) and of a relatively new peripheral nerve block (quadratus lumborum block) for the prevention of PONV and treatment of postoperative pain. We studied in a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial whether 100 mg <b>alizapride</b> is non-inferior to 4 mg ondansetron for the prevention of PONV in patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecological surgery. Primary endpoint was the incidence of nausea and the incidence of vomiting on the PACU. Non-inferiority was tested separately for both outcomes. With respect to the incidence of nausea and to the incidence of vomiting during PACU-stay <b>alizapride</b> failed to show non-inferiority in comparison to ondansetron. Also regarding the incidence of PONV in the PACU and the overall incidence of PONV during 24 hours <b>alizapride</b> failed to demonstrate non-inferiority. Ondansetron-treated patients required significantly less rescue medication than placebo-treated patients. From this study, we concluded that {{there is no evidence that}} 100 mg <b>alizapride</b> is non-inferior in comparison to 4 mg ondansetron for the prophylaxis of PONV. Unfortunately, the low adherence to and the limited knowledge of clinical guidelines is a well-known medical problem. We studied the incidence of PONV and the compliance to the departmental guidelines for the prevention of PONV in our institution in an uncontrolled before-and-after study using a quasi-experimental design. In a first audit, we investigated the compliance with the departmental algorithm for PONV prevention. The results of this audit revealed that the adherence to our institutional guidelines for PONV-prevention was very low. The results of this audit prompted us to simplify our institutional algorithm for the prophylaxis of PONV. All female patients now receive a triple prophylaxis (consisting of dexamethasone, ondansetron plus either a target controlled infusion with propofol or droperidol) and all male patients obtain double prophylaxis with dexamethasone and ondansetron. This simplification of our algorithm for the prevention of PONV resulted in a significant reduction of the PONV-incidence and in a better compliance with the algorithm. Lidocaine is an amide local anesthetic with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antihyperalgesic properties. Systemic lidocaine has been successfully used as a co-analgesic for the treatment of acute postoperative pain, especially in abdominal surgery. We studied in a randomized placebo-controlled trial the effect of systemic lidocaine on postoperative pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic sterilization in day-case surgery. Patients received an intravenous bolus injection of lidocaine 1. 5 mg kg- 1 at induction of anesthesia followed by a continuous infusion of 1. 5 mg kg- 1 h- 1 until 30 minutes after arrival on the PACU. The proportion of patients with a numeric rating scale > 3, the mean numeric rating scales for pain and the opioid consumption could not be reduced by an intravenous lidocaine infusion. The median time to meet the criteria for hospital discharge were lower in patients receiving systemic lidocaine, a finding with statistical significance but questionable clinical relevance for which we were unable to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Plasma levels of lidocaine measured when stopping the lidocaine infusion were all under the toxic dose of 5 µg ml- 1. From this study, we concluded that systemic lidocaine shortens time to discharge readiness, but has no additional analgesic value in laparoscopic sterilization. In addition, we studied the effect of systemic lidocaine on postoperative morphine requirements in patients undergoing posterior spinal arthrodesis in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. The patients received a bolus of lidocaine (1. 5 mg kg- 1) and an intravenous lidocaine infusion (1. 5 mg kg- 1 h- 1) until 6 hours after arrival on the PACU. Systemic lidocaine had no influence on morphine consumption during the first 24 postoperative hours. Regarding the numeric rating scores for postoperative pain, PONV-incidence, return of intestinal function, length of hospital stay and inflammatory properties no effect of systemic lidocaine could be shown. We concluded from this trial that systemic lidocaine has no analgesic efficacy and place in multimodal pain management in spinal surgery. A transversus abdominis block or quadratus lumborum block is a rather new peripheral nerve block providing analgesia to the skin and muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. It is known from the literature that a quadratus lumborum block can reduce cumulative opioid consumption in the first 24 postoperative hours after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The same effects are reported for systemic lidocaine in the literature. We studied the superiority of a quadratus lumborum block in comparison with perioperative systemic lidocaine for postoperative analgesia after laparoscopic colorectal surgery in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. Patients received either a quadratus lumborum block preoperatively, a systemic lidocaine infusion perioperatively until four hours after arrival on the PACU or placebo. There was no significant difference between the quadratus lumborum group and the lidocaine group in morphine requirements during the first 24 hours. Significant differences were however observed for total morphine requirements on the PACU, for the total number of PCIA-boli demanded by the patients and the number of PCIA-boli delivered by the pump the first 24 postoperative hours between the three groups: Interestingly, the placebo-group received less morphine compared to the quadratus lumborum and lidocaine group. PONV and postoperative pain remain two important complaints with a great impact on postoperative outcome. We investigated new approaches to prevent PONV and postoperative pain. In summary, our studies revealed that these new approaches, i. e., the use of <b>alizapride</b> for PONV prophylaxis, the use of systemic lidocaine and the quadratus lumborum block in concepts of multimodal analgesia, had not the hypothesized efficacy. In contrast, following the introduction of the new PONV algorithm we observed an improved compliance of anesthetic care providers with the departmental PONV guidelines. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{involvement}} of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 5 -HT 3 receptors in {{the mechanisms of}} severe emesis evoked by cytotoxic drugs or by total body irradiation have been studied in ferrets. Anti-emetic compounds tested were domperidone (a dopamine antagonist), metoclopramide (a gastric motility stimulant and dopamine antagonist at conventional doses, a 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist at higher doses) and BRL 24924 (a potent gastric motility stimulant and a 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist). Domperidone or metoclopramide prevented apomorphine-evoked emesis, whereas BRL 24924 did not. Similar doses of domperidone did not prevent emesis evoked by cis-platin or by total body irradiation, whereas metoclopramide or BRL 24924 greatly reduced or prevented these types of emesis. Metoclopramide and BRL 24924 also prevented emesis evoked {{by a combination of}} doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. These results are discussed in terms of a fundamental role for 5 -HT 3 receptors in the mechanisms mediating severely emetogenic cancer treatment therapies. There have recently been two important advances relating to the improvement of anti-emetic treatment given to patients undergoing anti-cancer therapies. Firstly, it was found that, unlike conventional doses of metoclopramide (Maxolon; Beecham Pharmaceuticals) which antagonise dopamine receptors and stimulate gastric motility, high doses of the drug greatly reduced cis-platin-evoked emesis (Gralla et al., 1981). In contrast, even high doses of the dopamine antagonists, domperidone (Motilium; Janssen Pharmaceuticals) or <b>alizapride,</b> have little or no ability to prevent cis-platininduce...|$|E
40|$|Abstract It is {{commonly}} {{claimed that the}} nausea and vomiting accompanying cytotoxic chemotherapy {{have a negative impact}} on health-related quality of life. While this may seem self-evident, until a few years ago there was little empirical data demonstrating that the failure to control postchemotherapy emesis affects aspects of quality of life. In spite of their limitations, several observational studies showed that nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy induced a decrease in health-related quality of life with respect to patients without nausea and vomiting. This has also been demonstrated after the adjustment for health-related quality of life before chemotherapy that is an important prognostic factor of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Furthermore, one study suggests that the optimal time of assessment of quality of life to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is day 4 if a 3 -day recall period is used or day 8 when the recall period is 7 days. In double-blind studies the efficacy, tolerability and impact on quality of life of the 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists was superior with respect to metoclopramide, <b>alizapride</b> and prochlorperazine. Similar results have been achieved with the combination of ondansetron with dexamethasone, the standard treatment for the prevention of acute emesis induced by moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, with respect to the metoclopramide plus dexamethasone combination. Instead, in another double-blind study, in patients submitted to moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, a 5 -HT 3 antagonist did not seem to significantly increase complete protection from delayed emesis and the patients' quality of life with respect to dexamethasone alone. In conclusion, the evaluation of quality of life in randomized trials comparing different antiemetic drugs for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting can add important information useful for the choice of the optimal antiemetic treatment. </p...|$|E
