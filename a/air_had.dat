5|$|Color <b>Air</b> <b>had</b> {{only one}} seating class, offered no {{on-board}} beverages {{and had no}} frequent flyer program or lounges. Color <b>Air</b> <b>had</b> an agreement for tickets to be sold at the Rimi supermarkets, {{as well as by}} phone and Internet. If bought at a travel agency, there was a NOK 200 surcharge. This was because Color Air was not linked to the Amadeus booking system, owing to the costs associated with membership.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April, Color Air won {{a two-year}} {{contract}} with Norway Post for all air mail from Oslo to Trondheim and Ålesund. On 10 April, Color Air started a weekly round trip each Saturday to Alicante Airport in Spain. On 12 April, Ove Johan Solem {{took over as}} CEO of Color Air. In May, the company increased the cabin load from 38 to 48%, with ridership increasing from 33,978 to 44,081. These numbers also included {{a change in the}} number of seats per plane. The following month, 46,777 people traveled with the airline. By the end of July, Color <b>Air</b> <b>had</b> lost NOK350 million. However, in July, Color <b>Air</b> <b>had</b> a cabin load exceeding 50%, the level Sunde had stated was necessary to make a profit.|$|E
5|$|As the 777s {{continue}} to phase in, the 747s are being progressively retired. On 5 January 2015, EVA <b>Air</b> <b>had</b> retired their first 747 variant, the combi variant. In 2016, EVA {{announced that the}} last 747-400 passenger service will be mid-May 2017. Last planned 747-400 long range service will be 26 March 2017. The airline will {{continue to}} operate the two daily 747-400 to Shanghai until mid-may. The airline also plans to retire the 747 freighters when the 777 freighters are delivered. EVA retired the Boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft from its fleet on 21 August.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, {{the company}} {{won the first}} public service {{obligation}} tender that was issued by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Starting 1August, Teddy Air started serving Fagernes Airport, Leirin, with routes to Oslo and Bergen. The contract gave a subsidy of NOK23.7 million for three years, and was 15 percent lower than what Coast <b>Air</b> <b>had</b> been receiving. On 20May 1997, Teddy Air started its first international route, from Stavanger to Gothenburg in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|In October 2004, a {{contract}} was signed with Haugesund-based Coast Air, who would operate Jetstream 31 aircraft between Skien and Bergen. The owner of Coast Air, Kystfly, also bought 20% of Vildanden. Coast <b>Air</b> <b>had</b> previously operated routes from Skien to Western Norway, but had withdrawn in 1999. Following the announcement from Vildanden and Coast Air, the municipality {{decided to not}} close the airport, and cover the estimated NOK300,000 annual deficit, as well as upgrade the control tower for NOK700,000. The airport had been closed since 2002, following the increased domestic and international traffic from near-by Sandefjord Airport, Torp.|$|E
5|$|The Indonesian Transport Ministry {{said that}} if the {{aircraft}} showed signs of problems, the checks would be expanded to cover all 737s operating in Indonesia. On 5 March, it was reported that five of the six aircraft had returned to normal operations, but the sixth was still undergoing a full maintenance overhaul at maintenance, repair and overhaul firm, GMF AeroAsia facility.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1998, {{it became}} clear that Braathens had {{increased}} capacity by 20%, but only achieved a 5.2% ridership increase after the opening of Gardermoen. Similar numbers were applicable for SAS. The business market, in particular the large corporations with divisions in several large cities, were demanding high frequencies on the routes. Color Air could get by with fewer departures because they mainly targeted the leisure segment. In particular, the routes from Oslo to Ålesund and Kristiansand had a very low seat utilization; to Ålesund there were 1.2 million seats annually, but only 345,000 passengers, giving a 29% cabin load. Accumulated cabin load for Color Air was 32%, with 116,176 passengers. In {{the course of the last}} quarter of 1998, Color Air lost NOK91 million, or NOK1 million each day. For the whole year, Color <b>Air</b> <b>had</b> an average ticket price of NOK453, giving a revenue of NOK 57 million. NOK45 million was used on taxes, giving NOK12 million to cover operating costs of NOK209 million. The company lost NOK197 million in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Coast Air {{continued}} {{to provide a}} service until 1 August 1996, when Fagernes became a trial {{for the use of}} public service obligations for regional aviation in Norway. The first contract was won by Teddy Air, to serve both Oslo and Bergen. The contract agreed a subsidy of NOK 23.7 million for three years, 15% less than Coast <b>Air</b> <b>had</b> been receiving. Teddy Air operated until 1August 1999, when Widerøe took over using de Havilland Canada Dash 8-100 aircraft. At the same time, the route from Fagernes to Bergen was dropped from the schedule. Widerøe's contract lasted only eight months, until 1 April 2000, when Guard Air, who bid NOK 6.93 million per year, won the tender, and started flying with Dornier 228 aircraft. On 8October 2001, Guard Air filed for bankruptcy, and the ministry signed an intermediate contract with Widerøe to fly the route. The subsequent tender was won by Arctic Air, who continued operation until 31 March 2003, using Dornier 228 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Braathens {{announced}} that they would re-register all their planes in Sweden {{to avoid having to}} pay value added tax on catering and fuel. Color Air and SAS, who had their planes registered abroad, had gotten away without paying the taxes, since it only applied to Norway-registered planes. Following this announcement, the Ministry of Finance changed the rules so also foreign-owned planes had to pay the tax. The change in rules cost Color Air NOK10 million per plane per year. From 1 July 1999, the seat tax was removed, but replaced by an equivalent tax for each passenger. This made it cheaper to fly an empty plane, but more expensive to fly a full one. Color <b>Air</b> <b>had</b> reduced the number of seats in each plane to avoid the seat tax, but increased them again after the tax was removed.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the storm}} was {{tracking}} towards the northwest, between another low pressure system to its west and a low- to mid-level ridge to its east. Throughout the day, thunderstorm activity remained unstable, possibly {{as a result of}} cooler waters churned up by previous storms. In addition, mid- to upper-level dry <b>air</b> <b>had</b> become entrained into the circulation, and the storm contained some subtropical characteristics with a baroclinic-type cloud pattern. By early September 29, Isaac had slowed and turned towards the west. Convection began to intensify and consolidate later that day; outflow had also improved, and became more symmetric in nature. Moving into warmer waters, Isaac continued to strengthen, and attained hurricane status on September 30. However, this period of intensification was short-lived, and the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 85mph (140km/h) at around 0000 UTC on October 1. Around that time, a ragged eye feature appeared on satellite imagery.|$|E
5|$|Kosmos {{was bought}} by the Skaugen Group in 1988, and on 21 October, Kosmos' Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Bjørn Bettum and Chairman Otto Grieg Tidemand were fired. The Skaugen Group decided to {{integrate}} Kosmos' shipping and oil-related activities into their group. All other investments, including Norsk Air, were to be sold or closed. At the time, Norsk <b>Air</b> <b>had</b> 140 employees. Norsk Air's CEO, Mr. Røsjodet, made contact with Bård Mikkelsen, who was CEO of Widerøe, {{to try to convince}} them to purchase Norsk Air. Widerøe was a that time solely occupied with flying on the subsidized regional routes. The company was interested in having some non-subsidized routes to better benchmark its operations. The two largest owners, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Braathens SAFE, did not want to purchase Norsk Air, but the third-largest owner, Fred. Olsen & Co. liked the idea, and bought SAS' and Braathens SAFE's 62.3 percent stake in Widerøe to make the deal possible. Other possible purchasers who had negotiated with Norsk Air were Sterling Airlines, Partnair and Jan Einar Johansen, former owner of Scandi Line.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, the Scandinavian Airlines {{route from}} Molde to Bergen {{was taken over}} by Widerøe. However, while Scandinavian Airlines {{previously}} flew from Molde at 06:45, Widerøe's first flight departed at 08:55. Krohn Air stated that it saw this as a market opportunity to provide a business service from Molde to Bergen. Krohn <b>Air</b> <b>had</b> just bought a Jetstream 32 from Sun-Air, which it planned to use on a new route from Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget to Trondheim. However, after Widerøe stated that it would start that route in 2011, Krohn Air changed their plans and announced that the aircraft would instead be used on the route from Molde to Bergen. The Bergen service was started on 31 August. On 7 September, the airline announced it would start services from Molde to Stavanger Airport, Sola on 13 August. Because there were few passengers, the services to Bergen and Stavanger were terminated from 19 November 2010.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{announcing his}} {{campaign}} for governor, Wolf submitted an inquiry to the Massachusetts Ethics Commission as a precaution {{there would be no}} conflict of interest. However, on August 2 the Commission ruled that Wolf's 23% ownership of the company did create a conflict because Cape <b>Air</b> <b>had</b> ongoing contracts with the Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort); Wolf was instructed he would either need to resign from the Senate and discontinue his campaign from Governor, divest his stake in Cape Air, or cancel all contracts between Cape Air and MassPort. In a statement to supporters, explaining that departing his company or canceling contacts would put his employees' jobs at risk, he announced that he would suspend his campaign, and resign from the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{scientist}} Galileo Galilei {{knew that}} <b>air</b> <b>had</b> mass {{and so was}} subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted {{the formation of a}} vacuum. However, it would remain for his pupil Evangelista Torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific sensation in Europe. The French mathematician Blaise Pascal reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the air pressure is lower. In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the Puy de Dôme mountain in central France and found that the column was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent.|$|E
5|$|The main {{market for}} the charter {{services}} was Stavanger Airport, Sola, mainly serving transport of personnel in the oil industry. By the 1980s, Norsk <b>Air</b> <b>had</b> up to four daily round trips between the two cities. In 1983, the airline received concession to start a regular scheduled service to Stavanger. A ten-seat Beechcraft Super King Air was bought and services started on 12 January 1984. Services to Bergen Airport, Flesland started on 10 July. Soon there were four daily round trips to both cities, supplemented by charter trips operated by Penguin. Starting on 26 March 1984, Norsk Flytjeneste experienced competition on the routes from Sandefjord to Bergen and Stavanger, when Busy Bee, on contract with Braathens SAFE, started flights using 50-passenger Fokker F27s. However, they operated only one round trip, with the same aircraft serving Sandefjord–Stavanger–Haugesund–Bergen.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 24 May, von Bock had thrown four divisions, of Reichenau's 6th Army, against the Belgian IV Corps position at the Kortrijk area of the Leie during the Battle of the Lys (1940). The Germans managed, against fierce resistance, to cross the river at night and force a one-mile penetration along a 13-mile front between Wervik and Kortrijk. The Germans, with superior numbers and {{in command of the}} <b>air,</b> <b>had</b> won the bridgehead. Nevertheless, the Belgians had inflicted many casualties and several tactical defeats on the Germans. The 1st, 3rd, 9th and 10th Infantry Divisions, acting as reinforcements, had counterattacked several times and managed to capture 200 German prisoners. Belgian artillery and infantry were then heavily attacked by the Luftwaffe, which forced their defeat. The Belgians blamed the French and British for not providing air cover. The German bridgehead dangerously exposed the eastern flank of the southward stretched BEF's 4th Infantry Division. Montgomery dispatched several units of the 3rd Infantry Division (including the heavy infantry of the 1st and 7th Middlesex battalions and the 99th Battery, 20th Anti-Tank Regiment), as an improvised defence.|$|E
