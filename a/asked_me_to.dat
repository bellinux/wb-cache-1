5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
25|$|Yesterday I {{stood at}} Arlington National Cemetery {{attending}} {{the funeral of}} a young Marine in my district. He believed in {{what we were doing}} is the right thing and had the courage to lay his life on the line to do it. A few minutes ago I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that we will see this through.|$|E

25|$|Lynn Townsend was at {{odds with}} the Dodge Dealers and wanted to do {{something}} to please them. So in 1965 he <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come to his office - for the second time. He noted that one of the Dodge Dealer Council requests was for a Barracuda type vehicle. The overall dealer product recommendation theme was the same - we want what Plymouth has. The specific request for a Mustang type vehicle was not as controversial to Lynn. His direction to me was to give them a specialty car but he said 'for God's sake don't make it a derivative of the Barracuda': i.e. don't make it a Barracuda competitor.|$|E
25|$|When he {{was really}} down, {{depressed}} about things. A relationship had failed. He rang me in a terrible state and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go down to his house in Frankston. Joan, my wife, said you better go. He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do {{for such a long}} time. Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.|$|E
25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to.</b> That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E

This sentence prevented his ever applying again to any of Mississippi's all-white colleges. Roberts was given five years' probation and freed. In 2005, when an investigation was re-opened into the case, Roberts testified under oath that Kennard was innocent: [...] "Kennard did not <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> steal, Kennard did not <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> break into the co-op, Kennard did not <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do anything illegal." ...|$|R

500|$|The spanking thing started because I {{believed}} that my character in Dick Tracy liked to get smacked around and that's why she hung around {{with people like}} Al Pacino's character. Warren [...] <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> write some songs, one of them, the Hanky Panky song, was about that. I say in the song 'Nothing like a good spanky', {{and in the middle}} I say, 'Ooh, my bottom hurts just thinking about it'.

It would have been a tribute to Hergé. Fanny Remi <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> finish it, and I began work on it, but after a few months she changed her mind. I didn't insist, but for me it was logical that there was a studio, there were artists in the studio, Casterman asked for it to be finished, there were twenty-three finished books, that one story was not finished; so I had to finish it." ...|$|E
500|$|Coincidentally Larry Hama, then {{an editor}} at Marvel, had begun to design {{characters}} and background for a series concept he was pitching that would be entitled Fury Force, about a team of futuristic super-soldiers affiliated with S.H.I.E.L.D., an existing Marvel Universe property combining military and science fiction genre elements. As Hama tells it, he got the job of writing for the series because Marvel had asked every other available creator to write it {{and no one else}} would.

500|$|In a 2008 {{speech in}} Washington, Gillard {{endorsed}} the ANZUS Alliance {{and described the}} United States as a civilising global influence. Her former colleague and leader Mark Latham wrote in a 2009 article for the Australian Financial Review that these comments were [...] "hypocritical", given past private communications Gillard had exchanged with him which apparently mocked elements of American foreign policy: [...] "One of them concerned her study tour of the US, sponsored by the American Government in 2006—or to use her moniker—'a CIA re-education course'.

He rejected his Brazilian citizenship. Marin has <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> study the situation deeply in order to keep him from ever playing for Spain.

They showed me the script and let me have some input, {{and it was really}} terrific." [...] The film made US$90 million worldwide, to a mixed critical reception. A year later, Larter served as an associate producer of and starred in the thriller Three Way, and in 2005, she appeared in the independent political thriller Confess, and had a role in the romantic comedy A Lot Like Love, starring Amanda Peet and Ashton Kutcher.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, she was {{featured}} partially nude in leading Indian photographer Dabboo Ratnani's annual calendar, {{which is a}} major happening in the Indian glamour industry.

[...] A career highlight for the model, it led to a three-year contract with Ratnani to feature her on his annual calendar.
