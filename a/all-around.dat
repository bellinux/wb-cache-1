She qualified as an individual on the floor exercise for the NCAA National Championships, the second Brown gymnast ever to do so, but did not advance beyond the preliminary round.|$|E
5|$|Four Egyptian gymnasts, three {{artistic and}} one rhythmic, {{qualified}} for the Olympics. Mohamed El-Saharty, the lone male, was invited to London as the highest-ranked African in the individual <b>all-around</b> at the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.

5|$|Liukin {{performed}} <b>all-around</b> in the qualifying {{round of}} competition. She fell on her dismount from the uneven bars, but nevertheless qualified to the <b>all-around</b> final {{with a score}} of 63.325, which ranked her just behind Shawn Johnson, her friend and Olympic roommate. Liukin also qualified to three event finals: beam, uneven bars (in spite of the fall) and floor exercise.|$|E
5|$|On August 15, Liukin {{performed}} clean routines on {{all four}} events (sticking her landings on {{three out of four}} events) to win the <b>all-around</b> gold medal with a final score of 63.325. Shawn Johnson took the silver medal with a score of 62.725. The win marked the third time that an American woman had won the Olympic <b>all-around</b> title; Mary Lou Retton and Carly Patterson were the two previous American gold medalists. It was also the fourth {{time in the history of}} the Games that two athletes from the same country had taken first and second place in the women's <b>all-around.</b> The last time this was accomplished was the 2000 Olympics, when Romanian gymnasts won gold and silver; Soviet gymnasts also won gold and silver <b>all-around</b> medals at the 1952 and 1960 Games.|$|E
5|$|By 2003, Liukin {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} junior gymnasts in the United States. She won the junior {{division}} of the U.S. National Championships, as well as gold medals on three of the four events: uneven bars, balance beam and floor exercise. She repeated these accomplishments in 2004. Liukin {{was a member of the}} gold-medal winning U.S. team at the 2003 Pan Am Games; she took second place in the <b>all-around</b> behind fellow American Chellsie Memmel. She also won the <b>all-around</b> in the junior division of the 2004 Pacific Alliance Championships.|$|E
5|$|Despite limited {{training}} time on floor and vault {{in the summer}} of 2007, Liukin opted to compete <b>all-around</b> at the 2007 U.S. National Championships. She posted the highest score of the entire meet on bars and the second highest score on beam {{on the second day of}} competition, winning the senior bars title for the third year in a row and placing second on beam. However, she also suffered several falls and errors on floor and vault, and finished in third place overall, more than five points behind Shawn Johnson, the <b>all-around</b> gold medalist.|$|E
5|$|At the 2003 National Championships, Sacramone placed 14th in the <b>all-around,</b> won {{a bronze}} medal on floor exercise, and placed fourth on vault, earning {{a spot on the}} {{national}} team. Later that year, she participated in her first international competition as a senior, the Massilia Gym Cup in Marseille, France, where she placed fourth on floor and ninth on vault.|$|E
5|$|Cody was {{a forward}} on the {{basketball}} teams coached by Ray Morrison. Tom Zerfoss and Cody were the starting forwards on the SIAA champion 1919â€“1920 team. As a senior, Cody won the Porter Cup as the school's best <b>all-around</b> athlete.|$|E
5|$|During {{his career}} in Wisconsin, Kindt was {{considered}} to be the team's best <b>all-around</b> player, a person who could run, throw, and kick efficiently, as well as playing defense. He also punted and played safety for Wisconsin. Kindt was named to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1988 and the University of Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Liukin won {{her first}} senior National Championships and, once again, earned gold medals on {{the bars and}} beam. At the 2005 World Championships in Melbourne, she {{finished}} second in the <b>all-around</b> behind teammate Chellsie Memmel with a score of 37.822.|$|E
5|$|In late August, at the 2006 U.S. National Championships, Liukin {{successfully}} defended her <b>all-around,</b> {{beam and}} bars titles, becoming a two-time senior national champion. She {{was named to}} the U.S. team for the 2006 World Gymnastics Championships in Aarhus, Denmark, and was expected by many to be a strong contender for the <b>all-around</b> title. However, because of an ankle injury sustained in training before the competition began, she was only able to compete on one event, the uneven bars. In spite of her injury, in the qualification round, Liukin's bars set earned a 16.2, the highest score of any competitor on any apparatus in the meet. Her bars routine in team finals scored a 15.7 and helped the U.S. team win the silver medal. Liukin also qualified for the event finals on bars, where she took a small step on her dismount and finished with a 16.05, earning a silver medal behind Britain's Beth Tweddle.|$|E
5|$|Israel {{qualified}} a {{squad of}} rhythmic gymnasts for the individual and group <b>all-around</b> by finishing in the top 15 (for individual) and top 10 (for group) at the 2015 World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany. The competitors in the team event all made their first Olympic debut. The group was considered Israel's best chance for a gold at the Olympics after they had finished in first place for the hoops and clubs disciplines at the European Championships. In the first round, Israel finished in sixth place. The team performed worse in the second round, with their score the worst among all teams. The group <b>all-around</b> achieved a total of 34.883 points and qualified for the final after finishing in sixth place in the qualification round. The team finished in sixth place again in the finals round {{with a total of}} 34.549 and did not win a medal.|$|E

5|$|Salma El-Said and Sherine El-Zeiny {{qualified}} for the Olympics as the second and third-ranked Africans at the 2011 World Championships, with El-Zeiny having been offered a spot after the highest-placed African, Nicole Szabo of South Africa, turned down the invitation due to injury. El-Said had taken a break from active competition while recovering from an injury of her own and came back shortly before the World Championships. Since then she had taken the individual <b>all-around</b> title at the 2011 Arab Games and the 2012 African Championships. El-Zeiny was {{a veteran of the}} 2008 tournament and both had been a part of Egypt's victorious <b>all-around</b> team at the 2012 African Championships. In London, El-Said's best event was the balance beam, in which she placed 42nd. She was also 63rd in the uneven bars, 69th in the floor exercise, and was ranked 41st overall in the individual <b>all-around.</b> El-Zeiny was 53rd on the balance beam, but finished 82nd and last in the floor exercise after suffering an injury. Yasmine Rostom, the rhythmic gymnast, qualified by being the top performer from Africa at the 2011 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. In London she was 23rd in the ball and the hoop, 20th in the clubs, and last in the ribbon to finish 23rd out of 24 competitors overall.|$|E
5|$|The Ancient Olympic pentathlon (comprising long jump, javelin, discus, the stadion {{race and}} wrestling) was a {{precursor}} to the track and field combined events and this ancient event was restored at the 1906 Summer Olympics (Intercalated Games). A men's <b>all-around</b> {{was held at the}} 1904 Summer Olympics, contested between five American and two British athletes.|$|E
5|$|The turrets {{were placed}} on pear-shaped barbettes; the first six ships had this arrangement, but the last two, Caesar and Illustrious, had {{circular}} barbettes. The BII mountings {{in the first six}} ships allowed <b>all-around</b> loading from the supply of ready ammunition kept in the turret, but the guns had to return to the centerline to bring ammunition up from the magazines, as the ammunition hoists did not rotate with the turret. Caesar and Illustrious, with their circular barbettes, had BIII mountings with rotating hoists, and these allowed <b>all-around</b> loading from the magazines. Both the BII and BIII mounts had a range of elevation from 5degrees to 13.5degrees, with the loading angle at maximum elevation. During World War I, four of the Majestics were disarmed, and these guns were used to arm eight s. A further two turrets from Illustrious were later emplaced as coastal guns on the Tyne.|$|E
5|$|American swimmer Michael Phelps {{received}} {{a total of}} eight gold medals, {{more than any other}} Olympian in a single Olympic games, setting numerous world and Olympic records in the process. Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt also set records in multiple events, completing the 100 m final with a time of 9.69 seconds, surpassing his own previous world record. Russian-born American gymnast Nastia Liukin won the <b>all-around</b> gold medal in artistic gymnastics, becoming the third American woman to do so, following Mary Lou Retton in 1984 and Carly Patterson in 2004.|$|E
5|$|At the 2005 National Championships, Sacramone won the {{individual}} titles on floor and vault, scoring a 9.9 on floor, and placed {{third on the}} balance beam and fourth in the <b>all-around.</b> She {{was named to the}} American team, along with Nastia Liukin and Chellsie Memmel, for the 2005 World Championships in Melbourne, Australia, where she won a gold medal on floor and placed third on vault. She also defended her World Cup vault title, winning the event at both the World Cup qualifier in Ghent, Belgium, and the finals in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Both the London (1993) and New York (1994) cast albums of the Hytner {{production}} contain {{portions of}} dialogue that, according to Hischak, {{speak to the}} power of Michael Hayden's portrayal of Billy. Kenrick judges the 1994 recording the best <b>all-around</b> performance of Carousel on disc, despite uneven singing by Hayden, due to Sally Murphy's Julie and the strong supporting cast (calling Audra McDonald the best Carrie he has heard). The Stratford Festival issued a recording in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his power}} advantage, Woods has always focused on {{developing}} an excellent <b>all-around</b> game. Although {{in recent years}} he has typically been {{near the bottom of}} the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.|$|E
5|$|During the Games, Romanian gymnast Andreea RÄƒducan won {{the gold}} in women's artistic {{individual}} <b>all-around,</b> so she stripped her gold medal after she tested a banned positive substance. As so, her teammates Simona AmÃ¢nar and Maria Olaru, originally won silver and bronze, upgraded to gold and silver, respectively. While Chinese gymnast Liu Xuan moved up to bronze. At freestyle wrestling 76 kg event Alexander Leipold of Germany stripped off his gold medal after he was tested positive for nandrolone, handing it over to his American rival Brandon Slay.|$|E
5|$|Israel {{returned}} home from Rio de Janeiro with two bronze medals, each won by judoka Yarden Gerbi (women's 63kg) and Or Sasson (men's +100kg), an improvement from the nation's out-of-medal feat at London 2012. Several Israeli athletes advanced to the finals of their respective sporting events, but narrowly missed out of the podium, including the women's rhythmic gymnastics squad (captained by Alona Koshevatskiy) in the group <b>all-around,</b> triple jumper Hanna Knyazyeva-Minenko, and windsurfer Maayan Davidovich in the women's RS:X.|$|E
5|$|Liukin's {{struggles with}} the balance beam {{continued}} in the <b>all-around</b> final, where she fell from the apparatus during her flight series. In spite of a 16.100 on bars, the highest score of the day from any competitor on any event, she finished the competition in fifth place. In the event finals, however, Liukin rallied and regained her world champion title on the balance beam with a score of 16.025. She also earned a silver on the uneven bars behind Russia's Ksenia Semenova, scoring a 16.300 after taking a step on her dismount.|$|E

McCoy also was named {{a finalist for the}} Davey O'Brien Award, which goes to the country's top quarterback. Bradford and Harrell were the other two candidates; Tebow did not make the list for this award.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} {{defensive}} forwards of his era, Phillips was also known for his <b>all-around</b> skill, particularly his strong shot and endurance, and was considered, alongside Frank McGee, {{one of the two}} best players in all of hockey. His younger brother, Russell, also played for the Thistles and {{was a member of the}} team when they won the Stanley Cup. When the Hockey Hall of Fame was founded in 1945, Phillips was one of the original nine inductees.|$|E

After the season was completed, Richard {{underwent}} an emergency appendicectomy on October 26, 1977 at a Houston hospital. He {{spent most of the}} off-season working out at the Houston Astrodome and, for relaxation, fishing. In early 1978, he was a participant in ABC's Superstars <b>all-around</b> sports competition.|$|E
5|$|Team GB entered nine gymnasts {{into the}} artistic and {{trampoline}} events. Louis Smith, {{in winning the}} bronze medal in the men's pommel horse, became the first ever British gymnast to win an individual apparatus medal in gymnastics, and the first Briton to win any individual gymnastics medal since Walter Tysall won men's <b>all-around</b> medal in 1908. Laura Jones was originally chosen for the artistic gymnastics but, due to a slipped disc in her back, she {{was replaced by the}} reserve Imogen Cairns.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, The Exorcist was re-released in a 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback, hardcover, and {{audiobook}} formats {{with new}} cover artwork. As described by Blatty, this new, updated edition features new and revised material. The 40th Anniversary Edition of The Exorcist {{will have a}} touch of new material in {{it as part of}} an <b>all-around</b> polish of the dialogue and prose. First time around I never had the time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable â€“ plus one new character in a totally new very spooky scene. This is the version I would like to be remembered for. Tor/Forge have also re-published The Ninth Configuration and Legion, with new, updated cover artwork.|$|E
5|$|Liukin {{competed in}} her first National Championships as a junior in 2002, {{at the age of}} 12 and a half. In {{contrast}} to her WOGA teammates Carly Patterson and Hollie Vise, who finished first and second, respectively, Liukin suffered a fall on the uneven bars that rendered her unable to finish the routine. She continued {{through the rest of the}} competition and, despite the incomplete bars set, finished 15th, which landed her one of the final spots on the U.S. National Team. She was chosen to compete with the U.S. team at the 2002 Junior Pan American Championships, where she contributed to the team gold medal and placed second on the uneven bars and balance beam and in the <b>all-around.</b>|$|E
5|$|Liukin is {{fluent in}} English and Russian. She {{graduated}} from Spring Creek Academy, located in Plano, Texas, {{in the spring}} of 2007. She enrolled as a freshman international business major at Southern Methodist University in January 2008, and took a leave from classes to concentrate on preparations for the 2008 Olympic Games. She returned to campus in spring 2009, but her travel schedule and professional commitments caused her to withdraw {{before the end of the}} semester. She stated that she hoped to continue her studies at New York University in the future. Liukin's signature color is pink, hence her pink leotard worn during the 2008 Beijing Olympics <b>all-around</b> competition.|$|E
5|$|Liukin's {{first meet}} of the 2008 season was the American Cup in New York City, where she {{defeated}} 2007 winner Shawn Johnson to regain her title. She posted the highest {{score of the}} meet, a 16.600 on the uneven bars.
