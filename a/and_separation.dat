30|$|The {{empirical}} quantification of {{this equation}} using the LEHD data {{is also in}} Table  7. The hires <b>and</b> <b>separations</b> measures, {{as well as the}} job-to-job flows across dominant jobs, are from the data in Figures  1 and 3; the estimates of employment inflows and outflows are from tabulations of the confidential LEHD microdata. We find that 12 percent of the decline in hires <b>and</b> <b>separations</b> is associated with a decline in employment inflows and outflows, 43.4 percent is associated with job-to-job flows across dominant jobs, and the rest (44.6 percent) is associated with declines in secondary or short-duration job activity. While different from the point estimate using the CPS data (− 65 percent compared to 12 percent), the two datasets are telling the same story that flows into and out of employment are not the dominant explanation for the trend decline in hires <b>and</b> <b>separations.</b> Rather, the decline in hires <b>and</b> <b>separations</b> is driven by a decline in the job-to-job flow rates as well as by declines in worker flows associated with secondary and short-duration jobs.|$|R
30|$|Given the {{inability}} to explain the decline by shifts {{in the composition of}} individual and business characteristics, we explored a few additional methods of explaining the decline. The distribution of establishment-level employment change has been narrowing during the last 10 to 15 years, fully accounting for the decline in job creation and job destruction, yet this narrowing only explains {{about a third of the}} decline in hires <b>and</b> <b>separations.</b> This tells us that the explanation for the decline in hires <b>and</b> <b>separations</b> will be different than the explanation for the decline in job creation and job destruction. We also find that the decline in hires <b>and</b> <b>separations</b> is being driven by the decline in job-to-job flows and the disappearance of short-duration jobs in the U.S. economy.|$|R
5|$|Coddington {{and several}} others left the colony, {{establishing}} the settlement of Newport {{at the south end}} of the island. The freemen of Pocasset changed the name of their town to Portsmouth. They adopted a new government which provided for trial by jury <b>and</b> <b>separation</b> of church and state. The men who accompanied Coddington to Newport tended to be the strongest leaders; several became presidents or governors of the entire united colony after 1646, such as Coggeshall, Nicholas Easton, William Brenton, Jeremy Clarke, and Henry Bull. On 12 March 1640, the towns of Portsmouth and Newport agreed to re-unite peacefully. Coddington became governor of the island, and William Hutchinson was chosen as one of his assistants. The towns were to remain autonomous with laws made by the citizens.|$|E

5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} {{incompressible}} flows, where change in water density is negligible (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, <b>and</b> <b>separation</b> become critical because the high viscosity of water produces high shear stresses. Another consequence of high viscosity is the slip stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at high velocity.|$|E

These changes include pitting of the nails (pinhead-sized depressions in the nail is seen in 70% with nail psoriasis), whitening of the nail, small areas of bleeding from capillaries under the nail, yellow-reddish discoloration of the nails known as the oil drop or salmon spot, thickening of the skin under the nail (subungual hyperkeratosis), loosening <b>and</b> <b>separation</b> of the nail (onycholysis), and crumbling of the nail.|$|E
5|$|The first widely {{distributed}} comic strip to tackle LGBT themes {{and include a}} gay character was Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury. The strip introduced the character Andy Lippincott in 1976, and his diagnosis with HIV in 1989 and AIDS related death in 1990 was the first representation of this issue in comic strips. This storyline led to a Pulitzer Prize nomination for Trudeau, but three newspapers of the 900 carrying the strip refused to publish it as being in bad taste. Two years later, the long-standing character Mark Slackmeyer was revealed to be gay, continuing a reputation for controversial content.

30|$|We {{document}} {{and attempt to}} explain the recent decline in employment dynamics in the U.S. We have four major empirical findings. First, each measure exhibits a “stair step” pattern, with the declines concentrated in recessions and little increase during subsequent expansions. Second, changes {{in the composition of}} workers and businesses can explain only a small amount of the decline. Third, any explanation for the decline in job creation and job destruction will account for no {{more than one-third of the}} decline in hires <b>and</b> <b>separations.</b> Fourth, the decline in hires <b>and</b> <b>separations</b> is driven by the disappearance of short-duration jobs.|$|R

5|$|The {{strain of}} dual careers and {{constant}} separation {{from his wife}} led to an extended breach in his marriage. The couple began separation proceedings in 1916, <b>and</b> <b>separation</b> by mutual consent was granted in 1919. In the period 1916–22, Nielsen often lived on Funen retreating to the Damgaard and Fuglsang estates, or worked as a conductor in Gothenburg. The period was one of creative crisis for Nielsen which, coinciding with World War I, would strongly influence his Fourth (1914–16) and Fifth symphonies (1921–22), arguably his greatest works according to Fanning. The composer was particularly upset in the 1920s when his long-standing Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen was unable to undertake publication {{of many of his}} major works, including Aladdin and Pan and Syrinx.|$|E

5|$|Within its genus, the Iago sparrow {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the African 'rufous sparrows', a group which also includes species such as the great sparrow (Passer motitensis). These birds were usually treated as distinct species until Reginald Ernest Moreau, writing in the 1962 Check-list of the Birds of the World, lumped the Iago sparrow and the mainland rufous sparrows as the single species Passer motitensis. This taxonomy was followed frequently until J. Denis Summers-Smith, a world authority on sparrows, argued in the 1980s that the Iago sparrow's many differences in morphology and behaviour, <b>and</b> <b>separation</b> from the other rufous sparrows by about , are sufficient grounds for species status. Studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA have since suggested it may be a close relative of the house sparrow and the Spanish sparrow and not the rufous sparrows.|$|E
