5|$|The overall <b>acoustic</b> <b>system</b> is a {{distributed}} sound reinforcement system, {{which allows}} musicians on stage to hear each other clearly {{in a way}} that facilitates ensemble play. In addition, direct natural sound from the stage is reflected from architectural surfaces as well as being reinforced by two sound systems. The forward-facing reinforcement speakers time the relaying of sound so as to make it seem to have arrived directly from the stage with proper clarity and volume levels. Distributed speakers allow for lower sound volumes than would be necessary with centralized speakers, which would disturb neighboring residences and business.|$|E

40|$|Integrated <b>acoustics</b> <b>systems</b> {{providing}} {{navigation and}} communications and conducting acoustic measurements {{in support of}} science applications are, in concept, analogous to the Global Positioning System, but rely on acoustics because the ocean is opaque to electromagnetic waves and transparent to sound. A series of nested systems is envisioned, from small- to regional- to basin-scale. A small number of acoustic sources sending coded, low power signals can service unlimited numbers of inexpensive receivers. Drifting floats with receivers can be tracked accurately while collecting ocean circulation and heat content data, as well as ambient sound data about wind, rain, marine mammals, seismic T-phases, and anthropogenic activity. The sources can also transmit control data from users to remote instruments, and if paired with receivers enable two-way acoustic communications links. Acoustic-based instrumentation that shares the acoustic bandwidth completes the concept of integrated <b>acoustics</b> <b>systems.</b> The ocean observatories and ocean observing systems presently in the planning and implementation stages will require these integrated <b>acoustics</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
