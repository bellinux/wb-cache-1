5|$|A second joint {{appearance}} {{took place}} in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while Nixon was already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously looked at his watch, provoking laughter from the audience. The laughter recurred as Nixon, sitting behind Douglas <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke,</b> fidgeted to indicate his disapproval {{of what she was}} saying; she appeared bewildered at the laughter. Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, but she did not stay to listen.|$|E
5|$|The {{last half}} of the century's first decade was a time of sorrow, {{loneliness}} and constant work for Pankhurst. In 1907 she sold her home in Manchester and began an itinerant lifestyle, moving from place to place <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> and marched for women's suffrage. She stayed with friends and in hotels, carrying her few possessions in suitcases. Although she was energised by the struggle–and found joy in giving energy to others– her constant travelling meant separation from her children, especially Christabel, who had become the national coordinator of the WSPU. In 1909, as Pankhurst planned a speaking tour of the United States, Harry was paralysed after his spinal cord became inflamed. She hesitated to leave the country while he was ill, but she needed money to pay for his treatment and the tour promised to be lucrative. On her return from a successful tour, she sat by Harry's bedside as he died on 5 January 1910. Five days later she buried her son, then spoke before 5,000 people in Manchester. Liberal Party supporters who had come to heckle her remained quiet as she addressed the crowd.|$|E

25|$|In 1932, {{she began}} {{work as a}} nanny and teacher for the {{children}} of a German consul in Cuzco, Peru. In 1934, she lost one of her fingers to gangrene. That same year, she became a teacher in Lima and made scientific translations, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> five languages. When World War II broke out, German citizens were detained in Peru.|$|E
25|$|She {{retired from}} {{competitive}} swimming, {{and with her}} Olympic fame, began to lecture around the world about asthma management. GlaxoSmithKline sponsored her <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> to over 100 groups each year across the US and internationally. Hogshead earned the title of National Spokesperson for the American Lung Association. Hogshead authored the 1990 book, Asthma and Exercise, the first comprehensive book {{on the topic of}} asthma and sports. The book tells inspirational stories of athletes who learned to manage their condition.|$|E

500|$|Traditional modern {{literary}} critics of Sappho's poetry {{have tended to}} see her poetry as a vivid and skilled but spontaneous and naive expression of emotion: typical of this view are the remarks of H. J. Rose that [...] "Sappho wrote <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke,</b> owing practically nothing to any literary influence," [...] and that her verse displays [...] "the charm of absolute naturalness." [...] Against this essentially romantic view, one school of more recent critics argues that, on the contrary, Sappho's poetry displays and depends for its effect on a sophisticated deployment of the strategies of traditional Greek rhetorical genres.|$|E
500|$|Hill was short, {{like all}} her family, and {{indifferent}} to fashion. Her friend Henrietta Barnett wrote: [...] "She was small in stature with long body and short legs. She did not dress, she only wore clothes, which were often unnecessarily unbecoming; she had soft and abundant hair and regular features, but {{the beauty of}} her face lay in brown and very luminous eyes, which quite unconsciously she lifted upwards <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> on any matter for which she cared. Her mouth was large and mobile, but not improved by laughter. Indeed, Miss Octavia was nicest when she was made passionate by her earnestness." [...] Barnett also spoke of Hill's streak of ruthlessness. Gertrude Bell called Hill despotic. Later in Hill's life, the Bishop of London, Frederick Temple, encountered her {{at a meeting of}} the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and wrote, [...] "She spoke for half an hour … I never had such a beating in all my life." ...|$|E

[...] In another article reviewing the show, Adams noted that Tears of a Clown was [...] "the sort of thing you never thought you'd see a superstar do". He complimented Madonna's jokes, chatting about her life in-between songs, for being [...] "raw and vulnerable" [...] and confessed that it was [...] "fascinating— and difficult— to watch. We're not used to Madonna on stage doing {{anything less than a}} fully rehearsed, slick stage show." [...] Concluding the review, Adams believed that Tears of a Clown professed Madonna's touring direction into the future. Writing for The Independent Nick Levine noticed that the singer [...] "tested out her stand-up comedy skills with a series of risqué jokes and took the opportunity to defend her controversial fashion sense." [...] Debbie Cuthbertson from The Sydney Morning Herald gave a positive review of the show, saying [...] "For the queen of self-control, it was an open, at times even vulnerable insight into her persona. She seemed relaxed, drinking Cosmopolitans <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> at length between songs." [...] Cuthbertson also commended the choice of Forum Theatre as a venue believing it to be [...] "inspired, and her crew lit up the grand old dame in a way that showcased all her delicate charms in a way I can't recall any other act having ever done." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{a leader}} among women, she was beloved for her {{nurturing}} character. Not long after her death, Susa Young Gates remarked, [...] "Sister Zina was all love and sympathy, and drew people after her {{by reason of}} that tenderness." [...] She embraced the [...] "feminine sphere" [...] of her time, spending her life in Utah serving and influencing other women. Her [...] "hallmark was intimate care: nursing, midwifery, attendance at the sickbed, radiance in the blessing circle, and powerful spirituality <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> in or interpreted tongues." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{her last}} days, Kahlo was mostly {{bedridden}} with bronchopneumonia, though {{she made a}} public appearance on July 2, 1954, participating with Rivera in a demonstration against the CIA invasion of Guatemala. She seemed to anticipate her death, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> about it to visitors and drew skeletons and angels in her diary. The last drawing was a black angel, which biographer Hayden Herrera interprets as the Angel of Death. It was accompanied by the last words she wrote, [...] "I joyfully await the exit— and I hope never to return— Frida" [...] ("Espero alegre la salida — y espero no volver jamás").|$|E

2500|$|Jeremy became {{suspicious}} of his mother; {{he thought the}} vitamins were poisoning him. In February 2003, Elli took Jeremy to see Albert Brown, a self-taught [...] "natural healer." [...] Elli planned to send Jeremy to live with Brown for treatment. [...] He was to leave for Brown's on March 13, 2003, but days beforehand began to act more aggressively. On the 13th, after a shower he retrieved a steak knife [...] and tried to slit his wrists. Unsuccessful, Jeremy found his mother {{in the kitchen and}} attacked her <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> to a friend on the phone. Autopsy reports showed that Elli Perkins was stabbed 77 times.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to signing Genie would pantomime some words <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke,</b> for instance crouching into a seated position when saying the words [...] "sit" [...] or [...] "sick", and act out sequences of events. Unlike young children, for who this is ancillary to their speech and lessens as they acquire more language, Genie maintained {{this as an}} integral part of her vocabulary. At first Genie only drew pictures if specifically asked, but later began to draw pictures or use images from magazines or books to relate to daily experiences or if she could not express herself in words. Until 1973 Curtiss and Fromkin unsuccessfully tried to teach Genie to read and write, although other people made subsequent attempts; by the time Curtiss presented her dissertation Genie had learned to read approximately five to ten unspecified names and words, and could write individual letters in print.|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{said that}} once {{she won the}} Critics Choice Award at the BRIT Awards {{she said she was}} more excited for her album to come out and that her {{confidence}} has grown, as her album wasn't out at time of the awards, but she said no matter how happy she was with the record there will always be doubts lurking somewhere. [...] "I'd spent so long behind the scenes writing for other people and featuring on other people's records so it just felt so good to get the acknowledgement for me as an artist in my own right." [...] She spoke on the relief she had once she had signed a record deal with Virgin Records in 2010 <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> it was a [...] "long journey to get signed" [...] as she said [...] "once you get established as a songwriter it's quite hard to get people to recognise you as an artist in your own right. It felt like a long battle to get people to see me and believe in my music. Lots of Record labels didn't want to sign me. So it was great to prove people wrong in that sense." ...|$|E
