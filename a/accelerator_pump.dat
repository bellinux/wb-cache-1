2500|$|An <b>accelerator</b> <b>pump</b> portion {{is either}} {{remotely}} mounted or {{mounted on the}} carburetor body. The <b>accelerator</b> <b>pump</b> is either mechanically connected to the throttle, or it is operated by sensing the manifold pressure change when the throttle is opened. [...] Either way, it injects a measured amount of extra fuel into the air stream to allow smooth engine acceleration.|$|E
50|$|One of the downsides of the {{constant}} depression carburettor is in high performance applications. Since it relies on restricting air flow {{in order to produce}} enrichment during acceleration, the throttle response lacks punch. By contrast, the fixed choke design adds extra fuel under these conditions using its <b>accelerator</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The T engine had one carburetor, a side-draft, single-venturi unit. Its choke and {{throttle}} valves {{were controlled}} manually; {{the latter was}} with a hand lever rather than a foot pedal. The carburetor had no <b>accelerator</b> <b>pump.</b> Various vendors supplied Ford with carburetors for the T engine, including Holley, Zenith, and Kingston.|$|E
50|$|By now the GT and Sport had steel fuel tanks. The GT had shorter rear shocks {{to lower}} seat height for the American market, but it meant the bike would ground out more easily when cornering. The Amals on the GT were {{replaced}} by 30 mm DellOrtos with <b>accelerator</b> <b>pumps.</b> This reduced fuel economy a little.|$|R
5000|$|The 200 Mile formula {{was first}} run in Italy in 1972, at Imola. Ducati {{prepared}} eight 750 cc bikes for the event. Paul Smart, Bruno Spaggiari, Ermanno Giuliano, and Alan Dunscombe were secured as riders. By now racing fever had set in, and the factory wanted to win. The bikes had the new factory frames and 750 engines, and were once more prepared {{in a very}} short time. Wherever possible the bike was lightened, and new 40 mm Dell'Orto carburetors with <b>accelerator</b> <b>pumps</b> were used. These engines delivered [...] at 8,500 rpm.|$|R
25|$|In 1980, Honda only offered one model, {{designated}} as the Hawk, now simply designated CB400T. The CM400E took {{over the role of}} the cheaper Hawk I. It is similar to the European CB400NA. It has the same European styling and six-speed manual gearbox, although the pegs, footrest and gear lever are in the same position as the earlier Hawk variants. The bike became electric start only. Smaller 30mm Keihin CV carburettors with <b>accelerator</b> <b>pumps</b> were fitted to comply with US emissions controls. The 1981 model is similar to the European CB400NB and has a dual piston front brake caliper, plastic front fender and a different tank shape.|$|R
50|$|Some {{pressure}} carburetors {{had many}} auxiliary systems. The designs grew in complexity with the bigger models used on bigger engines. Many have an <b>accelerator</b> <b>pump,</b> an automatic mixture control, and models on turbocharged engines feature a temperature compensator. The {{result is that}} pressure carbureted engines are fairly simple to operate compared to float carbureted engines.|$|E
50|$|The over-square engine, {{that met}} Euro1, was fed by a Keihin slide type {{carburetor}} with <b>accelerator</b> <b>pump</b> for better pick-up. It {{makes use of}} a larger spring operated nozzle to provide a richer fuel air mixture into the engine for better acceleration. An air injection system injects fresh air into the exhaust port, to meet the emission norms.|$|E
50|$|The <b>accelerator</b> <b>pump</b> is {{also used}} to prime the engine with fuel prior to a cold start. Excessive priming, like an {{improperly}} adjusted choke, can cause flooding. This is when too much fuel and not enough air are present to support combustion. For this reason, most carburetors are equipped with an unloader mechanism: The accelerator is held at wide open throttle while the engine is cranked, the unloader holds the choke open and admits extra air, and eventually the excess fuel is cleared out and the engine starts.|$|E

In that Imola 200 held in April, Smart and Spaggiari came in first and second. The effect on Ducati sales was remarkable. Suddenly, a lot more people the world over knew about Ducati.|$|R
40|$|A {{section of}} the LEP beam pipe. This is the chamber in which LEP's {{counter-rotating}} electron and positron beams travel. It is made of lead-clad aluminium. The beams circulate in the oval cross-section part of the chamber. In the rectangular cross-section part, LEP's innovative getter-strip vacuum pump is installed. After heating to purify {{the surface of the}} getter, the strip acts like molecular sticky tape, trapping any stray molecules left behind after the <b>accelerator's</b> traditional vacuum <b>pumps</b> have done their job...|$|R
5000|$|Standard-Triumph fitted a 1596 cc {{version of}} their {{traditional}} straight-6 derived from the engine used in the Standard Vanguard Six, but with a smaller bore diameter of 66.75 mm, compared with the 74.7 mm bore on the Vanguard, equipped with twin Solex B32PIH semi-downdraught carburettors These were soon replaced by B321H carburettors, as the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pumps</b> proved a problem. The curious observer will notice a [...] "seam" [...] on the cylinder block between the third & fourth cylinders revealing the humble design beginnings from the 803 cc Standard 8 block of 1953. The gearbox was strengthened and upgraded to much closer (more sporting) gear ratios, and also offered with optional Laycock De Normanville 'D-type' overdrive that offered a top gear with a 20% higher ratio (the equivalent change from 3rd to 4th in a standard box), giving more relaxed and economical cruising {{at the expense of}} slight oil drag from the pump in the overdrive unit. The rear axle was changed to a slightly uprated differential, but retaining the same 4.11:1 ratio. Front disc brakes were standard as were larger rear brake drums, and the Herald fuel tank was enlarged, retaining the handy reserve feature (essentially a curved pickup pipe that could be rotated to dip into the last few centimetres of fuel) of the smaller Herald tank. The front suspension featured uprated springs to cope with the extra weight of the new engine, but the rear suspension was basically standard Herald—a swing-axle transverse-leaf system which quickly proved inadequate for the relatively powerful Vitesse. The chassis looked similar to the early Heralds but in fact was substantially re-designed and strengthened, especially around the differential mountings (and these improvements were immediately passed through to Herald production). The Vitesse was available in convertible and saloon forms; a coupé never got beyond the prototype stage.A handful of Vitesse estates also were assembled to special order at Standard-Triumph's Service Depot at Park Royal in West London.|$|R
50|$|The R90S {{had a small}} bikini fairing which housed four {{analogue}} instruments: a speedometer, tachometer, {{clock and}} voltmeter. Its 238 watt alternator was later upgraded to 250 watt. An adjustable hydraulic steering damper was manually adjusted via a knob on the steering head. Suspension was by long-travel telescopic forks and twin rear shocks whose rear dampers were adjustable for preload (the only suspension adjustment available). Whereas other BMW boxers had Bing slide constant velocity carburetor, the R90S was fitted with <b>accelerator</b> <b>pump</b> Dell'Orto carburetors. The R90S engine had a 9.5:1 compression ratio, while the less sporty R90/6 had a ratio of 9:1.|$|E
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{remedy for}} a flooded carbureted engine is to steadily hold the throttle full open (full power position) {{while continuing to}} crank the engine. This permits the maximum flow of air through the engine, flushing the overly rich fuel mixture out of the exhaust. If the exhaust system is hot enough to autoignite, an after-fire may result; {{this can be seen}} as a flame discharging through the exhaust system. On a fuel-injected engine, ignoring the throttle (no fuel) while starting permits electronic logic systems to produce the correct fuel mixture, often based on exhaust gases. Some fuel injection computers interpret 'pumping' the throttle to indicate a flooded engine, and alter the fuel-air mixture accordingly. In a carbureted engine equipped with an <b>accelerator</b> <b>pump</b> (which advances fuel flow to match air ingestion under rapid throttle acceleration), 'pumping' the throttle will force excess fuel into the engine, further flooding it.|$|E
5000|$|Liquid gasoline, being denser than air, is {{slower than}} air {{to react to}} a force applied to it. When the {{throttle}} is rapidly opened, airflow through the carburetor increases immediately, faster than the fuel flow rate can increase. This transient oversupply of air causes a lean mixture, which makes the engine misfire (or [...] "stumble")—an effect opposite to that which was demanded by opening the throttle. This is remedied {{by the use of}} a small piston or diaphragm pump which, when actuated by the throttle linkage, forces a small amount of gasoline through a jet into the carburetor throat. This extra shot of fuel counteracts the transient lean condition on throttle tip-in. Most accelerator pumps are adjustable for volume or duration by some means. Eventually, the seals around the moving parts of the pump wear such that pump output is reduced; this reduction of the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pump</b> shot causes stumbling under acceleration until the seals on the pump are renewed.|$|E
50|$|Engine {{flooding}} was {{a common}} problem with carbureted cars, but newer fuel-injected ones are immune to the problem when operating within normal tolerances. Flooding usually occurs during starting, especially under cold conditions or because the <b>accelerator</b> has been <b>pumped.</b> It can also occur during hot starting; high temperatures may cause fuel in the carburetor float chamber to evaporate into the inlet manifold, causing the air/fuel mixture to exceed the upper explosive limit. High temperature fuel may also result in a vapor lock, which is unrelated to flooding but has a similar symptom.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{some of the}} {{numerical}} analyses of one-dimensional compressible flow with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) interaction have been carried out. A detailed study {{of this type of}} flow is vital for an understanding of many practical devices, such as the MHD generator, <b>accelerator</b> and <b>pump.</b> The steady conservation equations, coupled with the generalized Ohm 2 ̆ 7 s law, were solved. Numerical results for channels with flows of constant velocity, temperature and pressure, respectively, could be obtained, but a rather peculiar area variation is required. As {{in the case of a}} constant velocity flow, the channel can be classified into a total of three possible types dependent on the load factor, and the flow Mach number decreases with an increase in the load factor. On the other hand, in the case of a constant temperature flow, the flow Mach number increases with an increase in the load factor. There is some precise set of initial flow properties that flow velocity reaches sonic and smooth acceleration or deceleration through sonic condition occurs...|$|R
30|$|Magnetohydrodynamic free {{convection}} finds applications in fluid engineering {{problems such as}} MHD <b>pumps,</b> <b>accelerators</b> and flow meters, plasma studies, nuclear reactors, geothermal energy extraction, etc. Free convective flow past a vertical plate {{in the presence of}} a transverse magnetic field has been studied by several researchers. Kim [4] studied the magnetohydrodynamic convective heat transfer past a semi-infinite vertical porous moving plate with variable suction. The combined effects of thermal and mass diffusion on the unsteady {{free convection}} flow of a viscous incompressible fluid over an infinite vertical porous plate was investigated by Takhar et al. [5]. Ahmed et al. [6] considered the effects of thermal diffusion on a three-dimensional MHD free convection flow of a viscous incompressible fluid over a vertical plate embedded in a porous medium.|$|R
5000|$|The Quadrajet is a [...] "spread bore" [...] carburetor; {{the primary}} {{venturis}} are {{much smaller than}} the secondary venturis. By comparison, a [...] "square bore" [...] carburetor has primary and secondary venturis of similar size. Most Quadrajets were capable of 750 ft3 L/min (cfm) maximum, but some rare Buick and Pontiac models were capable of 800 ft3 L/min for use on high performance engines, and most 1984-1987 pickup trucks were also equipped with the 800-cfm carb. Most Quadrajets use a vacuum operated piston to move the primary metering rods to control the air-fuel ratio, allowing the mixture to be lean under low load conditions and rich during high load conditions. A less-common version uses a linkage driven off the primary throttle shaft to mechanically move the power piston. [...] "E" [...] (electronic control module controlled) series of Quadrajets use a computer controlled mixture control solenoid that responds to electronic signals from the throttle position and oxygen sensors via the computer, ideal for precise fuel metering and allowing additional fuel under load. The solenoid-controlled metering rods allow the fuel mixture to be very close to optimum, then the solenoid is pulse width modulated at about 6 Hz to fine-tune the air fuel ratio under closed loop conditions. The electronic versions have a throttle position sensor that is mounted inside the carburetor body, actuated by the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pump</b> lever.|$|E
50|$|A {{second problem}} with the {{conventional}} carburettor was its good performance in steady conditions, but poor progression: its dynamic ability to respond, such as when suddenly opening the throttle. This could give 'flat spots' in performance, or required great additional complexity to the carburettor such as multiple chokes, emulsion tubes and accelerator pumps. The Fish carburettor metered its fuel flow through a calibrated tapered groove, connected directly to the accelerator pedal and the throttle butterfly. The fuel metering orifice was controlled in immediate proportion to the throttle position, {{in a similar manner}} to the motorcycle slide carburettor. Between the float chamber and the venturi, an additional chamber, unique to the Fish design, contains the metering arm and groove. The arm is attached to the throttle spindle, moves with it, and is drilled with a hollow channel supplying fuel to the jets on the throttle spindle. This arm has an inlet hole at its end, which is a simple drilling and not of precise size. The hole passes over the metering groove, which is a radial arc in one wall of the chamber and it is the width of this groove which is precisely controlled, so as to accurately meter the fuel. As the throttle arm moves to the wide-throttle position, the arm sweeps across to the wider part of the groove, allowing more fuel to flow. The arm is close-fitting within the width of the chamber. As it moves, this close fit has the effect of a vane pump and acts as an <b>accelerator</b> <b>pump</b> to force additional fuel into the jet when the throttle is first opened.|$|E
40|$|A company {{program was}} planned {{which has a}} main drive to develop those {{emission}} reduction concepts that have the promise of earliest success. These programs were proposed {{in an attempt to}} enhance existing engine systems, exploiting their potential for emission reduction as far as is compatible with retaining the well established features in them that are well understood and in current production. The intended programs identified in the area of new concepts were: (1) upgrading the TCM fuel system, (2) evaluation of <b>accelerator</b> <b>pump,</b> (3) reduced cooling requirement, and (4) variable spark timing...|$|E
40|$|The flow of a {{dusty and}} {{electrically}} conducting fluid through apipe {{in the presence}} of a transverse magnetic field is encountered in a variety of applications uch as magnetohydrodynamic generators, <b>pumps,</b> <b>accelerators,</b> and flowmeters. Inthese devices, the solid particles in form of ash or soot are suspended in the conducting fluid as a result of the corrosion and wear activities and/or the combustion processes in MHD generators and plasma MI-ID accelerators. The consequent effect of the presence of solid particles on the performance of such devices has led to studies of particulate suspensions in conducting fluids {{in the presence of}} externally applied magnetic fields. When the particle concentration becomes high and random particle-particle interaction takes place, the performance or efficiency of these devices deteriorates drastically. Mutual particle interaction leads to higher particle-phase viscous stresses and can be accounted for by endowing the particle phase by the so called particle-phase viscosity. There have been many articles dealing with theoretical modeling and experimental measurements of the particle-phase viscosity in a dusty fluid (see, for instance, Soo [1], Gidaspow, Tsuo, and Luo [2], Grace [3], and Sinclair and Jackson [4]). The particulat...|$|R
40|$|Transverse {{pulse-to-pulse}} trajectory instability, ‘jitter’, in the linac of the SLAC Linear Collider (SLC) can {{be caused}} by various sources, including mechanical vibration, poor power supply regulation, and malfunctioning of trajectory feedbacks systems. Additionally, the linac can amplify pulse to pulse centroid motion that originates in the damping ring or the transport line that connects the ring to the linac. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify and characterize these sources and to apply corrections and fixes. Transverse jitter has been reduced in the last year from 0. 5 to 0. 2 in x and 1 to 0. 3 in y, measured in units of beam size. Jitter is estimated using position monitor data from a large sample of successive pulses. The FFT power spectrum of the data often indicate roughly equal contributions from motion at 59 Hz due to the <b>accelerator</b> cooling water <b>pumps,</b> 10 Hz motion due to mechanical vibration or power supplies, and < 0. 4 Hz due to the feedback loops. Some of the broadband, or random, pulse to pulse motion can be correlated with the microwave instability in the damping ring. In this paper we describe the data analysis and interpretation that can be used to help locate the subsystem component which is causing the instability. ...|$|R
40|$|Ion {{beams of}} MeV energy are in routine use as depth microscopes to {{determine}} composition and impurity profiles with depth resolutions of 100 - 300 Å over near-surface regions. Backscattering spectrometry with He ions and proton-induced x-rays are simple to implement. These techniques {{have been used}} in studies of thin-film reactions, solid-phase epitaxy, metallurgy of integrated circuits and solar cells, oxidation and corrosion, and other near-surface phenomena. The Spacelab orbital environment provides the possibility of depositing contamination-free films on clean interfaces. Ion beam techniques for material analysis can then be used to evaluate thin-film interdiffusion, and compound formation in a contaminant-free ambient. In addition, the ion beam techniques would be available for rapid analysis of near-surface regions of other experiments, such as molecular-beam epitaxy. The instrumentation-semiconductor nuclear-particle detectors and multichannel analyzer for such measurements are simple and were used in early Surveyor lunar analyses. The accelerator is based on the tandem <b>accelerator</b> principle <b>pumped</b> by the vacuum of space. It consists of a series of eight light equispaced titanium concentric spheres which are supported on a single insulating hollow column. The largest sphere which is at the potential of the spacecraft has a diameter of 200 cm. The smallest sphere has a diameter of 30 cm and is maintained at l MV potential. Voltage is generated between the largest sphere and the smallest sphere by using an inductively charged stapled belt to physically transfer charge. The belt system operates in vacuum {{within the confines of the}} hollow insulating column and needs only energy to supply bearing losses and the work done against the electrostatic forces. A series of small holes located collinear on the concentric spheres create a region of uniform electrostatic field which accelerate negative particles to 1 MeV at the terminal. Here a small gas canal is used for stripping electrons from the particles, causing them to change sign from negative to positive. These positive particles are repelled from the terminal back to ground to give He^(++) particles with energies up to 3 MeV and H^+ of 2 MeV. Two types of ion sources would be provided with this device. The first, a simple Penning source, would produce H^- beams for proton-induced x-ray measurement. A second lithium exchange source would provide He^- for backscatter measurements...|$|R
