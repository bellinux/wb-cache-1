50|$|Cognitive {{representations}} of social objects {{are referred to}} as schemas. These schemas are a mental structure that represents some aspect of the world. They are organized in memory in an <b>associative</b> <b>network.</b> In these associative networks, similar schemas are clustered together. When a particular schema is activated related schemas may be activated as well. Schema activation may also increase the accessibility of related schemas in the <b>associative</b> <b>network.</b> When a schema is more accessible this means it can more quickly be activated and used in a particular situation. When related schemas are activated, inferences beyond the information given in a particular social situation may influence thinking and social behavior, regardless of whether those inferences are accurate or not. Lastly, when a schema is activated a person {{may or may not be}} aware of it.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} this is {{demonstrated}} through a theory proposed by Gordon Bower called the <b>associative</b> <b>network</b> theory of feeling effects. Bower's theory explains the multiple associations of memory congruence within the paradigm of the nodes of the semantic memory network. The <b>associative</b> <b>network</b> theory of feeling effects explains how emotions are connected to many different words that represent the given emotion and represent different meanings for different individuals. Like with semantic memory networks, the nodes that represent particular emotions are triggered by the words that invoke that emotion. For instance, the word 'dog' can trigger different emotional nodes that represent different word strings and meaningful associations based on different and individual experiences. For a person who has only had positive interactions with the word 'dog', the person would subsequently connect to the emotional nodes that represented positive meanings such as dog = pet = happiness in childhood.|$|E

40|$|This chapter aims {{to expand}} the domain of brand image {{perception}} measurement by providing a method for eliciting brand <b>associative</b> <b>networks</b> and comparing it with traditional brand image measurement methods. This article then argues that these networks may differ from one individual to another, depending on the cultural background and/or the experience with the brand. Accordingly, the author introduces a methodology of clustering consumers with similar perceptions into distinct segments, which can be targeted differently. Using picture analysis and metaphor-based elicitation techniques, Lipton’s Ice Tea brand associations are extracted and utilized as an input {{for the creation of}} 160 individual <b>associative</b> <b>networks.</b> These networks are first aggregated to emphasize the brand reputation and subsequently clustered into 6 segments.

40|$|Concern about {{unethical}} {{behavior in}} the business world has moved many business colleges to examine the coverage of ethics in their coursework. Though some people think ethics cannot be effectively taught in college curricula because of a belief that ethics are formed by one’s upbringing, family and social influences, this study shows that ethical perceptions, as meas-ured in <b>associative</b> <b>networks,</b> can change after presenting information and having instructor-led discussion of ethical issues. Pathfinder analysis used in this study generates an <b>associative</b> or cognitive <b>network</b> for individuals and for group averages. These <b>associative</b> <b>networks</b> can be used to measure changes before and after presentation of information and group discus-sions of ethical issues. The results of this study show that people’s perceptions of ethical is-sues do change on average. It {{remains to be seen whether}} a change in one’s associative net-work persists over time or whether it could lead to changes in behavior. Beyond assessment of changes in <b>associative</b> <b>networks</b> and the impact of education, there is a brief discussion of how Pathfinder analyses might also be used by instructors to plan individualized education...|$|R

40|$|This study {{specifically}} {{addresses the}} question of how <b>associative</b> <b>networks</b> contribute to brand image perception measurement to segment the market more effectively, as well as to demonstrate brand image impairment. Carried out using surveys and experimental designs, this dissertation is positioned as part of the research stream on the use of <b>associative</b> <b>networks</b> in marketing, and particularly consumer mapping. Firstly, this study provides clear arguments for using brand concept maps (BCM) as highly suitable method to capture the complete brand image and segment the market based on brand perception. Secondly, thanks to BCM, the present research provide empirical evidences on the likelihood of brand image confusion, namely the dilution of attributes and the creation of unattractive associations, {{as a result of the}} introduction of a new brand. Thirdly, BCM captures the effect of exposure to negative user-generated content on the likelihood of doppelganger brand image, namely the appearance, or reinforcement, of negative associations at the brand reputation level. This work reveals that BCM is a superior approach to measure brand image and brand reputation, compared to dyadic methods. In addition, it broadens the applications of <b>associative</b> <b>networks</b> in marketing. Moreover this research shows how consumers and competitors may influence the brand image. Besides this scientific output, this research aims in providing brand mangers with an effective method to monitor and capture brand image and brand reputation...|$|R

Attitudes and attitude objects are functions of affective and cognitive components.

40|$|Markov Networks {{are widely}} used through out {{computer}} vision and machine learning. An important subclass are the <b>Associative</b> Markov <b>Networks</b> which are used {{in a wide variety}} of applications. For these networks a good approximate minimum cost solution can be found efficiently using graph cut based move making algorithms such as alphaexpansion. Recently a related model has been proposed, the <b>associative</b> hierarchical <b>network,</b> which provides a natural generalisation of the <b>Associative</b> Markov <b>Network</b> for higher order cliques (i. e. clique size greater than two). This method provides a good model for object class segmentation problem in computer vision. Within this paper we briefly describe the <b>associative</b> hierarchical <b>network</b> and provide a computationally efficient method for approximate inference based on graph cuts. Our method performs well for networks containing hundreds of thousand of variables, and higher order potentials are defined over cliques containing tens of thousands of variables. Due to the size of these problems standard linear programming techniques are inapplicable. We show that our method has a bound of 4 for the solution of general <b>associative</b> hierarchical <b>network</b> with arbitrary clique size noting that few results on bounds exist for the solution of labelling of Markov Networks with higher order cliques. ...|$|R

50|$|Roediger and McDermott {{are quick}} to point out that their results could be {{explained}} by an associative model of memory. That is, the presentation of associated words could spread activation through an <b>associative</b> <b>network</b> to the nonpresented lure word, and thus the false recognition of words could be due to residual activation. This model explains the higher false recognition in the second experiment as a product of more activation being spread due to the longer word-lists used. This theory has parallels with prototype theory, which claims that the presentation of patterns that match some prototype activates and increases the recognition of the prototype, even when it has never been presented. In terms of Roediger and McDermott's study, prototype theory would suggest that the list words activate the lure word (the prototype) that is then more easily recognisable. However, the fact that subjects reported ‘remembering’ the presentation of the critical lure suggests that there is some sort of explicit awareness of the lure during the presentation of words, which cannot be explained by prototype theory or by associative models of memory.|$|E

The present study, as far as literature is concerned, focuses on Umberto Eco's fourth novel Baudolino (2000), taking it as a typical example of multi-volume texts that seem to demand a careful approach. So, through this study, the analyst - in order to distinguish the preferred to the scientific reading - may use the common and rather traditional semiotic tool of isotopies, projecting it into Greimas' Generative Grammar, and on the way meaning is articulated in <b>associative</b> <b>networks.</b> Thus, it is examined whether this algorithmic confrontation leads to a multiscale analysis, with its bi-dimensionality verifying the concept of intertextuality, as conceived by Kristeva (1974, 1980). More specifically, the study methodologically passes through the theoretical concept of isotopies, as presented by various scholars, to carry on with the homogeneity traced with the <b>associative</b> <b>networks.</b> Next, the literary extracts from the original text show whether meaning can be anchored in phases, revealing how typology is related to topology (Lemke 2000) ...|$|R
