25|$|The {{governor}} general acts {{within the}} principles of parliamentary democracy and responsible government as a guarantor of continuous and stable governance and as a nonpartisan safeguard against the abuse of power.

25|$|The {{opinions}} that pit races {{against one another}} are likely to reflect Tolkien’s critique on war rather than a racist perspective. In The Two Towers, the character Samwise sees a fallen foe and considers for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> humanity of this fallen Southron who, just moments before, is {{shown to be a}} man of color. Director Peter Jackson considers Sam this scene in the director’s commentary of the scene and argues that Tolkien isn’t projecting any negative sentiments towards the individual soldier because of his race, but the evil that’s driving them from their authority, These sentiments, Jackson argues, were derived from Tolkien’s experience in the Great War and found their way into his writings to show the evils of war itself, not of other races.|$|E

25|$|Charles marched by Bridgnorth, Lichfield and Ashbourne to Doncaster, {{where on}} 18 August he {{was met by}} great numbers of Yorkshire gentlemen with {{promises}} of fresh recruits. For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> outlook was bright, for the Derbyshire men with Gell were far away at Worcester with Leven, the Yorkshire Parliamentarians engaged in besieging Scarborough and Pontefract castles and other posts. But two days later he heard that David Leslie with the cavalry of Leven's army was coming up behind him, and that, the Yorkshire sieges being now ended, Major-General Poyntz's force lay in his front.

25|$|At {{the time}} the French troops were debouching from Ligny, the 12th Brigade (Colonel Stülpnagel's) was posted in front of Sombreffe; and Colonel Rohr had just pushed forward towards Ligny with the 2nd Battalion of the 6th Kurmark Landwehr, when he {{perceived}} three French cavalry regiments advancing against {{the right wing of}} the brigade; whereupon he gradually retired, and the whole brigade threw itself into Sombreffe, just as the French cavalry made an attack at the entrance of Sombreffe, and captured the two guns of the Battery No. 12, which had been posted there. Major Dorville faced about the rear division of the 6th Kurmai'k Landwehr Cavalry, and gallantly attacked the French cavalry, in the hope of checking their progress; but the lances of his troopers were shivered against the cuirasses of their opponents, and for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> former could only defend themselves with their broken poles.

Among the influences on the young Bax was the Irish poet W. B. Yeats; Bax's brother Clifford introduced him to Yeats's poetry and to Ireland. Influenced by Yeats's The Wanderings of Oisin, Bax visited {{the west coast of}} Ireland in 1902, and found that [...] "in <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>the</b> Celt within me stood revealed".

500|$|Those who did read Austen saw {{themselves}} as discriminating readers—they were a cultured few. This became a common theme of Austen criticism during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Philosopher and literary critic George Henry Lewes articulated this theme {{in a series of}} enthusiastic articles in the 1840s and 1850s. In [...] "The Novels of Jane Austen", published anonymously in Blackwood's Magazine in 1859, Lewes praised Austen's novels for [...] "the economy of [...] easy adaptation of means to ends, with no aid from superfluous elements" [...] and compared her to Shakespeare. Arguing that Austen lacked the ability to construct a plot, he still celebrated her dramatisations: [...] "The reader's pulse never throbs, his curiosity is never intense; but his interest never wanes for <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>The</b> action begins; the people speak, feel, and act; everything that is said, felt, or done tends towards the entanglement or disentanglement of the plot; and we are almost made actors as well as spectators of the little drama." ...|$|E

After a brief frolic with prostitutes and a period of reflection, Pike and the gang try to forcibly persuade Mapache to release Angel, who by then was barely alive after the torture.

For <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>the</b> federales are so shocked that they fail to return fire, causing Engstrom to laugh in surprise. Pike calmly takes aim at Mohr and kills him, too. This results in a violent, bloody shootout—dominated by the machine gun—in which Pike and his men are killed, along with most of Mapache's present troops and the remaining German adviser.|$|E

500|$|The Parthians largely {{remained}} neutral during Caesar's Civil War, fought between forces supporting Julius Caesar {{and forces}} supporting Pompey {{and the traditional}} faction of the Roman Senate. However, they maintained relations with Pompey, and after his defeat and death, a force under Pacorus I assisted the Pompeian general Q. Caecilius Bassus, who was besieged at Apamea Valley by Caesarian forces. With the civil war over, Julius Caesar prepared a campaign against Parthia, but his assassination averted the war. The Parthians supported Brutus and Cassius during the ensuing Liberators' civil war and sent a contingent to fight on their side at the Battle of Philippi in 42BC.* Bivar (1993), 5657 After the Liberators' defeat, the Parthians invaded Roman territory in 40BC {{in conjunction with the}} Roman Quintus Labienus, a former supporter of Brutus and Cassius. They swiftly overran the Roman province of Syria and advanced into Judea, overthrowing the Roman client Hyrcanus II and installing his nephew Antigonus. For <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>the</b> whole of the Roman East seemed lost to the Parthians or about to fall into their hands. However, the conclusion of the second Roman civil war soon revived Roman strength in Asia. Mark Antony had sent Ventidius to oppose Labienus, who had invaded Anatolia. Soon Labienus was driven back to Syria by Roman forces, and, although reinforced by the Parthians, was defeated, taken prisoner, and killed. After suffering a further defeat near the Syrian Gates, the Parthians withdrew from Syria. They returned in 38BC but were decisively defeated by Ventidius, and Pacorus was killed. In Judaea, Antigonus was ousted with Roman help by Herod in 37BC.* Bivar (1993), 5758 With Roman control of Syria and Judaea restored, Mark Antony led a huge army into Atropatene, but his siege train and its escort were isolated and wiped out, while his Armenian allies deserted. Failing to make progress against Parthian positions, the Romans withdrew with heavy casualties. Antony was again in Armenia in 33BC to join with the Median king against Octavian and the Parthians. Other preoccupations obliged him to withdraw, and the whole region came under Parthian control.* Bivar (1993), 5865 ...|$|E

2500|$|In this way, Stevens's poems adopt {{attitudes that}} are corollaries to those earlier spiritual longings that {{persist in the}} {{unconscious}} currents of the imagination. [...] "The poem refreshes life so that we share, / For <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>the</b> first idea [...] [...] [...] It satisfies / Belief in an immaculate beginning / And sends us, winged by an unconscious will, / To an immaculate end." [...] The [...] "first idea" [...] is that essential reality that stands before all others, that essential truth; but since all knowledge is contingent on its time and place, that supreme fiction will surely be transitory. This is the necessary angel of subjective reality—a reality that must always be qualified—and as such, always misses the mark to some degree—always contains elements of unreality.|$|E

After basic infantry training, he served at various posts around the city with his unit. They were never sent to the front. In late April or early May, shortly before Germany's surrender, he deserted. Desertions were widespread during the last weeks of the war, although deserters were subject to death if caught. However, diminished morale and equally diminished risk of prosecution from a preoccupied and disorganized German military contributed to the growing wave of soldiers looking toward self-preservation. He left the city of Traunstein and headed for his nearby village. [...] "I used a little-known back road hoping to get through unmolested.
