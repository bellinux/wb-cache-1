A {{lack of any}} fanciful ideas {{is one of the}} most salient traits of all Far Eastern races, if indeed a sad dearth of anything can properly be spoken of <b>as</b> <b>salient.</b> Indirectly their want of imagination betrays itself in their every-day sayings and doings, and more directly in every branch of thought. Originality is not their strong point. Their utter ignorance of science shows this, and paradoxical as it may seem, their art, in spite of its merit and its universality, does the same. That art and imagination are necessarily bound together receives no very forcible confirmation from a land where, nationally speaking, at any rate, the first is easily first and the last easily last, as nations go. It is to quite another quality that their artistic excellence must be ascribed. That the Chinese and later the Japanese have accomplished results at which the rest of the world will yet live to marvel, is due to their--taste. But taste or delicacy of perception has absolutely nothing to do with imagination. That certain of the senses of Far Orientals are wonderfully keen, as also those parts of the brain that directly respond to them, is beyond question; but such sensitiveness does not in the least involve the less earth-tied portions of the intellect. A peculiar responsiveness to natural beauty, a sort of mental agreement with its earthly environment, is a marked feature of the Japanese mind. But appreciation, however intimate, is a very different thing from originality. The one is commonly the handmaid of the other, but the other by no means always accompanies the one.|$|E

5000|$|Altman and Kim (2015) {{find that}} homophily {{may affect the}} {{evolution}} of the degree distribution of scale-free networks. More specifically, homophily may cause a bias towards convexity instead of the often hypothesised concave shape of networks. Thus, homophily can significantly (and uniformly) affect the emergence of scale-free networks influenced by preferential attachment, regardless of the type of seed networks observed (e.g. whether it is centralized or decentralized). Although the size of clusters might affect the magnitude of relative homophily. [...] A higher level of homophily can be associated to a more convex cumulative degree distribution instead of a concave one.

5000|$|Theories {{suggest the}} {{claustrum}} may act to bind and integrate multisensory information, or else to encode sensory stimuli <b>as</b> <b>salient</b> or nonsalient (Mathur, 2014). One theory suggests the claustrum harmonizes and coordinates activity {{in various parts}} of the cortex, leading to the seamless integrated nature of subjective conscious experience (Crick and Koch, 2005; Stiefel et al., 2014). Disrupting claustral activity may lead to conscious experiences of disintegrated or unusually bound sensory information, perhaps including synesthesia. Such theories are in part corroborated by the fact that divinorum, which functions almost exclusively on the KOR system, can cause consciousness to be decoupled from external sensory input, leading to experiencing other environments and locations, perceiving other “beings” besides those actually in the room, and forgetting oneself and one’s body in the experience.|$|E
5000|$|The tale type {{index was}} criticized by Vladimir Propp of the Formalist {{school of the}} 1920s for {{ignoring}} the [...] of the motifs by which they are classified. Furthermore, Propp contended that using a [...] "macro-level" [...] analysis means that the stories that share motifs might not be classified together, while stories with wide divergences may be grouped under one tale type because the index must select some features <b>as</b> <b>salient.</b> [...] He also observed that while the distinction between animal tales and tales of the fantastic was basically correct—no one would classify Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf an animal tale because of the wolf—it did raise questions because animal tales often contained fantastic elements, and tales of the fantastic often contained animals; indeed a tale could shift categories if a peasant deceived a bear rather than a devil.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the assumptions identified by Berger et al. (1972), there are implicit assumptions inherent in expectation state theory. First, {{that men and women}} see their gender differences <b>as</b> <b>salient.</b> This is something that could differ based on the task that the group is working on (or what their common goal is), their cultural norms (are they more liberal or more conservative)may be more relevant than if they were working on a less gendered task (e.g., a, and even how strongly members themselves identify with their gender norms. If men and women are working on a highly gendered task (for example, a marketing team working on an advertising campaign for lipstick), expectation states then advertising campaign for flu vaccinations). Similarly, expectation states theory may be less relevant when referring to a group of individuals who do not conform to gender norms versus those that do.|$|E

50|$|To {{explain the}} {{relationship}} between semiotics and communication studies, communication {{is defined as the}} process of transferring data and-or meaning from a source to a receiver. Hence, communication theorists construct models based on codes, media, and contexts to explain the biology, psychology, and mechanics involved. Both disciplines recognize that the technical process cannot be separated {{from the fact that the}} receiver must decode the data, i.e., be able to distinguish the data <b>as</b> <b>salient,</b> and make meaning out of it. This implies that there is a necessary overlap between semiotics and communication. Indeed, many of the concepts are shared, although in each field the emphasis is different. In Messages and Meanings: An Introduction to Semiotics, Marcel Danesi (1994) suggested that semioticians' priorities were to study signification first, and communication second. A more extreme view is offered by Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1987; trans. 1990: 16), who, as a musicologist, considered the theoretical study of communication irrelevant to his application of semiotics.|$|E
5000|$|According to Kasarda, {{airports}} {{have evolved}} as drivers of business location {{and urban development}} {{in the 21st century}} {{in the same way as}} highways did in the 20th century, railroads in the 19th century, and seaports in the 18th century. The engine of the aerotropolis is the airport and its air routes which offer firms speedy connectivity to their distant suppliers, customers, and enterprise partners worldwide. Some aerotropolis businesses are more dependent on distant suppliers or customers halfway around the world than those located nearby. As economies become increasingly globalized and reliant on air commerce for trade in goods and services, the speed and agility aviation provides to long-distance movement of people and goods generate competitive advantages for firms and places. In the aerotropolis model, time and cost of connectivity replace space and distance as the primary metrics shaping development, with [...] "economies of speed" [...] becoming <b>as</b> <b>salient</b> for competitiveness as economies of scale and economies of scope.
