50|$|<b>Anconeus</b> is {{innervated by}} {{a branch of}} the radial nerve (cervical roots 7 and 8) from the {{posterior}} cord of the brachial plexus called the nerve to the <b>anconeus.</b> The somatomotor portion of radial nerve innervating <b>anconeus</b> bifurcates from the main branch in the radial groove of the humerus. This innervation pattern follows the rules of innervation of the musculature of the posterior forearm (extensor) compartment by the radial nerve.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Back {{of right}} upper extremity. (<b>Anconeus</b> labeled at bottom center.) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Anconeus</b> is {{supplied}} by the middle collateral artery from the profunda brachii artery.|$|E
50|$|The <b>anconeus</b> muscle {{can easily}} be palpated just medial to the {{olecranon}} process of the ulna.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{also known}} as the [...] "subanconeus muscle", for its {{relationship}} to the <b>anconeus</b> muscle.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>anconeus</b> is {{considered}} {{by some as a}} part of the posterior compartment of the arm.|$|E
50|$|The <b>anconeus</b> muscle (or anconaeus/ancon√¶us) {{is a small}} muscle on the {{posterior}} aspect of the elbow joint.|$|E
50|$|From {{the medial}} border {{a part of}} the flexor carpi ulnaris arises; while to the lateral border the <b>anconeus</b> muscle is attached.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anconeus</b> {{originates}} on {{the posterior}} {{surface of the}} lateral epicondyle of the humerus and inserts distally on the posterior surface of the ulna.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Small {{marginal}} osteophytes (arrows) of the processus <b>anconeus</b> of the ulna {{can be seen}} in this gross pathological {{specimen of}} a sow.|$|E
5000|$|The supinator and the <b>anconeus</b> {{are the two}} {{muscles in}} the {{posterior}} compartment of the forearm that do not pass through wrist extensor compartments.|$|E
50|$|The {{muscles of}} this {{compartment}} are the triceps brachii and <b>anconeus</b> muscle {{and these are}} innervated by the radial nerve. Their blood supply is from the profunda brachii.|$|E
50|$|Its role in elbow {{extension}} is trivial in humans. It {{assists in}} {{extension of the}} elbow, where the triceps brachii is the principal agonist, and supports the elbow in full extension. It also prevents the elbow joint capsule being pinched in the olecranon fossa during extension of the elbow. <b>Anconeus</b> also abducts the ulna and stabilizes the elbow joint. <b>Anconeus</b> serves to make minute movements with the radius on the ulna. In making slight abduction of the ulna, it allows any finger {{to be used as}} an axis of rotation of the forearm.|$|E
50|$|The elbow is innervated {{anteriorly}} by branches {{from the}} musculocutaneous, median, and radial nerve, and posteriorly from the ulnar nerve and {{the branch of}} the radial nerve to <b>anconeus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Trauma to {{the nerve}} {{supply of the}} <b>anconeus</b> muscle can usually result from a {{shoulder}} dislocation or fractures of {{the upper part of}} the humerus or around the olecranon, or any injury that damages the radial nerve. Harm inflicted upon the radial nerve through these mechanisms can paralyze the <b>anconeus</b> muscle as well as other extensors of the elbow and wrist. There are no specific acquired injuries that exclusively affect the <b>anconeus</b> muscle; however, any disease that compromises muscular functions, particularly arm extension (i.e. muscular dystrophy) will affect this particular accessory muscle. Heterotopic ossification can result from certain trauma as it is an abnormal growth of osseous tissue in non-osseous tissue (e.g. muscle tissue). The condition is usually found in the hips, although there have been documented cases of certain individuals with it occurring in the arms and legs. The cause for the process to initiate is not well understood, only that it typically results from surgery or trauma.|$|E
50|$|Extension in the humeroulnar joint is {{produced}} by the triceps brachii and <b>anconeus</b> muscle, with a tiny contribution from the muscles arising from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, such as the extensor digitorum muscle.|$|E
50|$|The Epitrochleoanconeus muscle (anconeous epitrochlearis muscle, anconeus-epitrochlearis or <b>anconeus</b> sextus) {{is a small}} {{accessory}} muscle of the arm {{which runs}} {{from the back of}} the inner condyle of the humerus over the ulnar nerve to the olecranon.|$|E
50|$|The {{muscle is}} used to {{stabilize}} the elbow during rapid flexion and extension while in a midposition, such as in hammering. The brachioradialis is synergistic with the brachialis and biceps brachii; the triceps brachii and <b>anconeus</b> are antagonistic.|$|E
50|$|Some {{consider}} <b>anconeus</b> to be {{a continuation}} of the triceps brachii muscle. Some sources consider it {{to be part of the}} posterior compartment of the arm, while others consider it part of the posterior compartment of the forearm.|$|E
50|$|The biceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis (which {{attaches}} distally) act to flex the elbow. (The biceps do not {{attach to}} the humerus.) The triceps brachii and <b>anconeus</b> extend the elbow, and {{attach to the}} posterior side of the humerus.|$|E
5000|$|Many mammals, such as dogs, cattle, and pigs, have {{a fourth}} head, the {{accessory}} head. It lies between the lateral and medial heads. [...] In humans, the <b>anconeus</b> is sometimes loosely called [...] "the fourth {{head of the}} triceps brachii".|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of muscles {{found in the}} posterior compartment are extrinsic, meaning its origin has {{some distance from the}} part that it moves. The brachioradialis and the <b>anconeus</b> are considered intrinsic muscles because they both arise within the forearm and they both move the forearm.|$|E
50|$|The brachioradialis, flexor of the elbow, {{is unusual}} {{in that it is}} located in the {{posterior}} compartment, but it is actually a muscle of flexor / anterior compartment of the forearm. The <b>anconeus,</b> assisting in extension of the elbow joint, is by some considered part of the posterior compartment of the arm.|$|E
50|$|It gives off, {{near its}} origin, the {{interosseous}} recurrent artery, which ascends to {{the interval between}} the lateral epicondyle and olecranon, on or through the fibers of the Supinator, but beneath the <b>anconeus,</b> and anastomoses with the middle collateral branch of the profunda brachii, the posterior ulnar recurrent and the inferior ulnar collateral.|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} of the elbow joint is to extend and flex the arm grasp and reach for objects. The range of movement in the elbow is from 0 degrees of elbow extension to 150 of elbow flexion. Muscles contributing to function are all flexion (biceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis) and extension muscles (triceps and <b>anconeus).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Elbow {{extension}} {{is simply}} bringing the forearm back to anatomical position. [...] This action is performed by triceps brachii with a negligible assistance from <b>anconeus.</b> Triceps originates with two heads posteriorly on the humerus {{and with its}} long head on the scapula just below the shoulder joint. It is inserted posteriorly on the olecranon.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interosseous}} recurrent artery (or recurrent interosseous artery) is {{an artery}} of the forearm which {{arises from the}} posterior interosseous artery near its origin. It ascends to the interval between the lateral epicondyle and olecranon, on or through the fibers of the supinator but beneath the <b>anconeus.</b> It anastomoses with the middle collateral artery.|$|E
50|$|The {{abductor}} pollicis longus lies immediately {{below the}} supinator and is sometimes united with it. It {{arises from the}} lateral part of the dorsal {{surface of the body}} of the ulna below the insertion of the <b>anconeus,</b> from the interosseous membrane, and from the middle third of the dorsal surface of the body of the radius.|$|E
5000|$|The forearm {{should have}} a neutral grip, {{the back of the}} hand should be {{superior}} and the palm should be inferior. The elbows should be pointed towards the scapulae. The Latissimus dorsi muscles aids the lateral rotators in transverse extension. [...] The <b>anconeus</b> muscles and triceps brachii muscles are involved isometrically in keeping the elbow straightened.|$|E
50|$|The radial {{nerve and}} its {{branches}} provide motor innervation to the dorsal arm muscles (the triceps brachii and the <b>anconeus)</b> and the extrinsic extensors of the wrists and hands; {{it also provides}} cutaneous sensory innervation {{to most of the}} back of the hand, except for the back of the little finger and adjacent half of the ring finger (which are innervated by the ulnar nerve).|$|E
50|$|The fibers {{converge}} to {{a single}} tendon to insert onto the olecranon process of the ulna (though some research indicates {{that there may be}} more than one tendon) and to the posterior wall of the capsule of the elbow joint where bursae (cushion sacks) are often found. Parts of the common tendon radiates into the fascia of the forearm and can almost cover the <b>anconeus</b> muscle.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{superfamily}} hominoidea or apes, {{configurations of}} {{the muscles of the}} posterior compartment of the forearm share similar characteristics. However, the <b>anconeus</b> is usually not present in the hylobates (gibbons). [...] Also, the extensor pollicis brevis is only present in the genus homo (humans) and the genus hylobates because the extensor pollicis brevis and the abductor pollicis longus exist as a single muscle in other genera.|$|E
50|$|The triceps brachii {{is a large}} muscle {{containing}} three heads a lateral, medial, and middle. The <b>anconeus</b> is a small muscle that stabilizes {{the elbow}} joint during movement. Some embryologists consider it as the fourth head of the triceps brachia as {{the upper and lower}} limbs have similar embryological origins, and the lower limb contains the quadriceps femoris muscle which has four heads, and is the lower limb equivalent of the triceps.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the bulk}} of the muscle body being visible from the {{anterior}} aspect of the forearm, the brachioradialis is a posterior compartment muscle and consequently is innervated by the radial nerve. Of the muscles that receive innervation from the radial nerve, it is one of only four that receive input directly from the radial nerve. The other three are the triceps, <b>anconeus,</b> and extensor carpi radialis longus. (All other posterior compartment muscles that receive radial innervation are supplied by the deep branch of the radial nerve.) ...|$|E
50|$|The lateral {{epicondyle}} of the humerus is a small, tuberculated eminence, curved a little forward, and giving {{attachment to the}} radial collateral ligament of the elbow joint, and to a tendon common to {{the origin of the}} supinator and some of the extensor muscles. Specifically, these extensor muscles include the <b>anconeus</b> muscle, the supinator, extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, and extensor carpi ulnaris. In birds, where the arm is somewhat rotated compared to other tetrapods, it is termed dorsal epicondyle of the humerus. In comparative anatomy, the term ectepicondyle is sometimes used.|$|E
