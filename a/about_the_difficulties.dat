5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed {{by the lack of}} intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton kept in touch with Susan B. Anthony, and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the movement from afar. Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony letters <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> of balancing domestic and public life, especially in a prejudiced society. As another antidote to the boredom and loneliness, Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly minded women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{there were}} no public art {{galleries}} in England with permanent collections. In 1816, {{in the face of}} his continued lack of success, Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections. He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815, but other than this had never been abroad. The 28-year-old Etty had fallen in love, and fretted <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> a potential marriage would cause, and whether it would be right to travel to further his career even though it would mean taking his new wife to a foreign country. In the event, the woman rejected him, and he set out for the Continent in early September 1816.|$|E

25|$|At this time, {{working as}} a schoolteacher {{was viewed as a}} {{position}} not suited for many women. Women who were middle-class or above were limited to roles as governesses by social convention. This created a dramatic shortage of qualified elementary teachers. She was initially worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> that middle-class women would face working in schools with members of lower social classes, but ultimately decided that such sacrifices would be justified because education was a noble cause. Otter College assured middle-class parents that their daughters would be educated around women of similar backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, {{during the}} Crimean War, Armstrong read <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> the British Army {{experienced}} in manoeuvring its heavy field guns. He decided {{to design a}} lighter, more mobile field gun, with greater range and accuracy. He built a breech-loading gun with a strong, rifled barrel made from wrought iron wrapped around a steel inner lining, designed to fire a shell rather than a ball. In 1855 he had a five-pounder ready for inspection by a government committee. The gun proved successful in trials, but the committee thought a higher calibre gun was needed, so Armstrong built an 18-pounder on the same design.|$|E
25|$|Local tourism {{officials}} {{viewed it}} as deus ex machina when Hollywood stepped in to rescue their industry. Harrison Ford, in the 1985 movie Witness, portrayed a Philadelphia detective who journeys to the Amish community {{in order to protect}} an Amish boy who has witnessed a murder in Philadelphia. The detective is attracted to the boy's widowed mother; the movie is less a thriller than a romance <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> faced by an outsider in love with a widow from The Community. The film was nominated for eight Oscars, and won two. However, the real winner was Lancaster County tourism.|$|E

Hoffman portrayed the enthusiastic rock critic Lester Bangs, a task by which he felt burdened, {{but he managed to}} convey the real figure's mannerisms and sharp wit after watching him in a BBC interview. The following year, Hoffman featured as the narrator and interviewer in The Party's Over, a documentary about the 2000 U.S. elections.

500|$|Stephanie Zacharek, {{writing for}} Salon.com {{said that with}} regard to issues of sexual {{orientation}} and homophobia, Babbit is preaching to the converted. Cynthia Fuchs, for NitrateOnline.com, agreed, stating that [...] "no one who is phobic might recognize himself in the film" [...] and that [...] "the audience who might benefit most from watching it either won't see the film or won't see the point." [...] David Edelstein said that the one sidedness of the film creates a lack of dramatic tension and calls it lazy counterpropaganda. In contrast, LaSalle said that [...] "the picture manages to make a heartfelt statement <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> of growing up gay" [...] and Timothy Shary said that the film openly challenges homophobia and offers support to teenaged gay viewers. Chris Holmlund said that the film shows that queer identity is multi-faceted, using as an example the scene where the ex-ex-gays tell Megan {{that there is no}} one way to be a lesbian.|$|E
500|$|For {{the second}} chorus, a new scene of Rihanna is introduced, with Rihanna meeting with her friends, having arrived at her destination, where they eat in {{restaurant}} and {{walk down the}} street.

During the final chorus, the singer is shown intimately dancing and partying with her boyfriend, whilst other scenes from the video are intercut.

500|$|Hitler {{called his}} senior {{officers}} and advisors to Munich {{for a meeting}} on May 4. Hitler spoke for about 45 minutes on the reasons to postpone the attack, essentially reiterating Model's arguments. A number of options were put forth for comment: going on the offensive immediately with the forces at hand, delaying the offensive further to await the arrival of new and better tanks, radically revising the operation or canceling it altogether. Manstein advocated an early attack, but requested two additional infantry divisions, to which Hitler responded that none were available. Kluge spoke out strongly against postponement and discounted Model's reconnaissance materials. Albert Speer, the minister of Armaments and War Production, spoke <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> of rebuilding the armoured formations and the limitations of German industry to replace losses. General Heinz Guderian argued strongly against the operation, stating [...] "the attack was pointless". The conference ended without Hitler coming to a decision, but Citadel was not aborted. Three days later, OKW, Hitler's conduit for controlling the military, postponed the launch date for Citadel to 12 June.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} {{portion of the}} book, a group of {{articles}} discuss which sets of laws {{should be used to}} regulate targeted killing. Philosophy professor Jeff McMahan of Rutgers University asks, [...] "Targeted Killing: Murder, Combat or Law Enforcement?". He says that eliminating enemies for purposes of self-defense is justified. McMahan [...] writes about the problematic nature of targeted killing and emphasizes regulations for law enforcement to avoid abuses of process. University of Pennsylvania law and philosophy professor Claire Finkelstein writes in [...] "Targeted Killing as Preemptive Action" [...] <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> of rationalizing targeted killing outside of the realm of typical combat between state actors. Finkelstein characterizes people as noncombatants unless they are a member of a group that includes identification through standardized attire and criminal behaviour patterns. Mississippi College School of Law professor Richard V. Meyer writes that current regulations and standards for targeted killing are inadequate. He says that any entity wishing to carry out targeted killing should first have to declare war on the targeted parties involved.|$|E
500|$|McGovern {{had made}} several real estate {{investments}} in the D.C.area and became interested in hotel operations. In 1988, using the money he had earned from his speeches, the McGoverns bought, renovated, and began running a 150-room inn in Stratford, Connecticut, {{with the goal of}} providing a hotel, restaurant and public conference facility. It went into bankruptcy in 1990 and closed the following year. In 1992, McGovern's published reflections on the experience appeared in Wall Street Journal and the Nation's Restaurant News. He attributed part of the failure to the early 1990s recession, but also part to the cost of dealing with federal, state and local regulations that were passed with good intentions but made life difficult for small businesses, and to the cost of dealing with frivolous lawsuits. McGovern wrote, [...] "I... wish that during the years I was in public office I had had this firsthand experience <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> business people face every day. That knowledge would have made me a better U.S.senator and a more understanding presidential contender."
