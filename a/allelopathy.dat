25|$|Many epichloae endophytes—including N. coenophialum {{symbiotic}} with Lolium arundinaceum (syn. Festuca arundinacea, tall fescue)—also produce ergot alkaloids {{that are}} toxic to mammalian herbivores. The ergot alkaloids occur at relatively low {{concentrations in the}} plant and are often difficult to detect analytically. By contrast, the lolines frequently accumulate to very high levels in grass tissues, and were, therefore, initially associated also with toxicity to mammalian herbivores. Specifically, the lolines {{were thought to be}} responsible for toxic symptoms called fescue toxicosis displayed by livestock grazing on grasses infected by N. coenophialum. However, subsequently it was demonstrated that only the endophyte-produced ergot alkaloids are responsible for the symptoms of fescue toxicosis (or summer syndrome), and not the lolines which, even at high doses, have only very small physiological effects on mammalians feeders. Another group of alkaloids, the senecio-type alkaloids, are produced by various plants and like the lolines, the senecio alkaloids possess a pyrrolizidine ring structure. Unlike the lolines, however, the senecio alkaloids exhibit strong hepatotoxicity, owing to a double bond between C-1 and C-2 in their ring structure. This double bond is absent in the lolines, explaining the lack of hepatotoxicity of this group of compounds. The lolines have been suggested to inhibit seed germination or growth of other plants (<b>allelopathy),</b> and to increase resistance of infected grasses against drought, but such effects have not been substantiated under more natural conditions of cultivation or in habitats.|$|E
2500|$|Plant {{secondary}} metabolites are {{low molecular}} weight compounds, sometimes with complex structures that have no essential role in primary metabolism. They function in processes such as anti-herbivory, pollinator attraction, communication between plants, <b>allelopathy,</b> [...] maintenance of symbiotic associations with soil flora and enhancing the rate of fertilization. Secondary metabolites have great structural and functional diversity and many thousands of enzymes {{may be involved in}} their synthesis, coded for by as much as 15–25% of the genome. Many plant secondary metabolites such as the colour and flavor components of saffron and the chemotherapeutic drug taxol are of culinary and medical significance to humans and are therefore of commercial importance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Allelopathy</b> is a {{biological}} phenomenon by which an organism produces {{one or more}} biochemicals that influence the germination, growth, survival, and reproduction of other organisms. These biochemicals are known as allelochemicals and can have beneficial (positive <b>allelopathy)</b> or detrimental (negative <b>allelopathy)</b> effects on the target organisms and the community. Allelochemicals are a subset of secondary metabolites, which are not required for metabolism (i.e. growth, development and reproduction) of the allelopathic organism. Allelochemicals with negative allelopathic effects {{are an important part}} of plant defense against herbivory.|$|E

50|$|Many crop cultivars show strong {{allelopathic}} properties, {{of which}} rice (Oryza sativa) {{has been most}} studied. Rice <b>allelopathy</b> depends on variety and origin: Japonica rice is more allelopathic than Indica and Japonica-Indica hybrid. More recently, critical review on rice <b>allelopathy</b> and the possibility for weed management reported that allelopathic characteristics in rice are quantitatively inherited and several allelopathy-involved traits have been identified.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{invasive}} {{plant species}} interfere with native plants through <b>allelopathy.</b> [...] A famous case of purported <b>allelopathy</b> is in desert shrubs. One {{of the most}} widely known early examples was Salvia leucophylla, because it was {{on the cover of the}} journal Science in 1964. Bare zones around the shrubs were hypothesized to be caused by volatile terpenes emitted by the shrubs. However, like many <b>allelopathy</b> studies, it was based on artificial lab experiments and unwarranted extrapolations to natural ecosystems. In 1970, Science published a study where caging the shrubs to exclude rodents and birds allowed grass to grow in the bare zones.A detailed history of this story can be found in Halsey 2004.|$|E

5000|$|The term <b>allelopathy</b> {{from the}} Greek-derived {{compounds}} allelo- and -pathy (meaning [...] "mutual harm" [...] or [...] "suffering"), {{was first used}} in 1937 by the Austrian professor Hans Molisch in the book Der Einfluss einer Pflanze auf die andere - Allelopathie (The Effect of Plants on Each Other - <b>Allelopathy)</b> published in German. He used the term to describe biochemical interactions that inhibit the growth of neighbouring plants, by another plant. In 1971, Whittaker and Feeny published {{a study in the}} journal Science, which defined allelochemicals as all chemical interactions among organisms. In 1984, Elroy Leon Rice in his monograph on <b>allelopathy</b> enlarged the definition to include all direct positive or negative effects of a plant on another plant or on micro-organisms by the liberation of biochemicals into the natural environment. Over the next ten years, the term was used by other researchers to describe broader chemical interactions between organisms, and by 1996 the International <b>Allelopathy</b> Society (IAS) defined <b>allelopathy</b> as [...] "Any process involving secondary metabolites produced by plants, algae, bacteria and fungi that influences the growth and development of agriculture and biological systems." [...] In more recent times, plant researchers have begun to switch back to the original definition of substances that are produced by one plant that inhibit another plant. Confusing the issue more, zoologists have borrowed the term to describe chemical interactions between invertebrates like corals and sponges.|$|E

50|$|<b>Allelopathy</b> is {{not universally}} {{accepted}} among ecologists {{and many have}} argued that its effects cannot be distinguished from the competition which results when two (or more) organisms attempt {{to use the same}} limited resource, to the detriment of one or both. <b>Allelopathy</b> is a direct negative effect on one organism resulting from the input of substances into the environment by another. In the 1970s, great effort went into distinguishing competitive and allelopathic effects by some researchers, while in the 1990s others argued that the effects were often interdependent and could not readily be distinguished.|$|E

50|$|His {{most highly}} cited papers {{investigate}} both {{the direct and}} indirect interactions between plants and with other organisms 1,2,3,4,5. More specifically, these interactions include resource competition, <b>allelopathy,</b> facilitation/mutualisms 2,3 and interactions with invasive species 4,5, as well as soil microbe 6, herbivore and competitor-mediated interactions 7.|$|E
50|$|Soil {{microorganisms}} also decrease pathogen and pest activity through competition. In addition, plants produce root exudates {{and other}} chemicals which manipulate their soil environment {{as well as}} their weed environment. Thus rotation allows increased yields from nutrient availability but also alleviation of <b>allelopathy</b> and competitive weed environments.|$|E
50|$|Some {{research}} {{also suggests that}} I. glandulifera may exhibit <b>allelopathy,</b> in which it excretes toxins that negatively affect neighboring plants, thus increasing its competitive advantage. This would further support the conclusion that pulling or cutting the plant and leaving it to decompose {{is not the best}} method to control this invasive species.|$|E
50|$|Lantana camara {{is known}} to be toxic to {{livestock}} such as cattle, sheep, horses, dogs and goats. The active substances causing toxicity in grazing animals is pentacyclic triterpenoids which result in liver damage and photosensitivy. L. camara also excretes chemicals (<b>allelopathy)</b> which reduce the growth of surrounding plants by inhibiting germination and root elongation.|$|E
50|$|The {{process by}} which a plant acquires more of the {{available}} resources (such as nutrients, water or light) from the environment without any chemical action on the surrounding plants is called resource competition. This process is not negative <b>allelopathy,</b> although both processes can act together to enhance the survival rate of the plant species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Allelopathy</b> is {{characteristic}} of certain plants, algae, bacteria, coral, and fungi. Allelopathic interactions are {{an important factor in}} determining species distribution and abundance within plant communities, and are also thought to be important in the success of many invasive plants. For specific examples, see spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), Casuarina/Allocasuarina spp., and nutsedge.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{aspect of}} diffuse knapweed’s success {{relies on the}} effect of its {{allelopathic}} chemicals in its novel environment. [...] Although there is still debate concerning the effectiveness of allelopathic chemicals in the field, the evidence of allelopathic effects demonstrated in a laboratory setting and its propensity to establish monocultures support the importance of <b>allelopathy</b> to diffuse knapweed’s success.|$|E
50|$|A {{study of}} Kochia scoparia in {{northern}} Montana by two {{high school students}} showed that when Kochia precedes spring wheat (Triticum aestivum), it reduces the spring wheat's growth. Effects included delayed emergence, decreased rate of growth, decreased final height and decreased average vegetative dry weight of spring wheat plants. A larger study later showed that Kochia seems to exhibit <b>allelopathy</b> on various crops in northern Montana.|$|E
50|$|They are {{trees or}} shrubs that are notable for their long, {{segmented}} branchlets that function as leaves. Formally termed , these branchlets somewhat resemble pine needles, although sheoaks are flowering plants. The leaves {{are reduced to}} minute scales encircling each joint. Fallen cladodes form a dense, soft mat beneath sheoaks, preventing the development of undergrowth (a phenomenon known as <b>allelopathy)</b> and making sheoak woods remarkably quiet.|$|E
5000|$|Less {{common than}} clumped distribution, uniform distribution, {{also known as}} even distribution, is evenly spaced. Uniform {{distributions}} are found in populations in which the distance between neighboring individuals is maximized. The need to maximize the space between individuals generally arises from competition for a resource such as moisture or nutrients, or {{as a result of}} direct social interactions between individuals within the population, such as territoriality. For example, penguins often exhibit uniform spacing by aggressively defending their territory among their neighbors. The burrows of great gerbils for example are also regularly distributed, which can be seen on satellite images. Plants also exhibit uniform distributions, like the creosote bushes in the southwestern region of the United States. Salvia leucophylla is a species in California that naturally grows in uniform spacing. This flower releases chemicals called terpenes which inhibit the growth of other plants around it and results in uniform distribution. [...] This is an example of <b>allelopathy,</b> which is the release of chemicals from plant parts by leaching, root exudation, volatilization, residue decomposition and other processes. <b>Allelopathy</b> can have beneficial, harmful, or neutral effects on surrounding organisms. Some allelochemicals even have selective effects on surrounding organisms; for example, the tree species Leucaena leucocephala exudes a chemical that inhibits the growth of other plants but not those of its own species, and thus can affect the distribution of specific rival species. <b>Allelopathy</b> usually results in uniform distributions, and its potential to suppress weeds is being researched. [...] Farming and agricultural practices often create uniform distribution in areas where it would not previously exist, for example, orange trees growing in rows on a plantation.|$|E
50|$|The {{brilliant}} {{red color}} of maple leaves {{is created by}} processes separate from those in chlorophyll breakdown. When the tree is struggling {{to cope with the}} energy demands of a changing and challenging season, maple trees are involved in an additional metabolic expenditure to create anthocyanins. These anthocyanins, which create the visual red hues, have been found to aid in interspecific competition by stunting the growth of nearby saplings (<b>allelopathy).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{few studies}} of the {{mutualism}} between M. schumanni-D. hirsuta have incorrectly concluded that these clearings are formed by <b>allelopathy</b> {{on the part of}} D. hirsuta. It was established that worker ants were injecting leaves with formic acid, a toxin commonly produced in ant species, and the plants started to die within 24 hours. Lemon ants are the only known insect to use formic acid as a herbicide.|$|E
50|$|Environmental {{factors such}} as light, {{temperature}} and humidity are controlled by automated systems in interior vertical ecosystems. Ecosystems that are situated outside require study {{and analysis of the}} natural variables of their particular area, combined with a study of the behaviour of the numerous plant species in the biotope in each location. The selection and combination of species {{is one of the key}} factors for correct development. This is known as positive <b>allelopathy.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of mucilage in seeds affects important ecological processes in some plant species, such as tolerance of water stress, competition via <b>allelopathy,</b> or facilitation of germination through attachment to soil particles. Some authors have also suggested a role of seed mucilage in protecting DNA material from irradiation damage. The amount of mucilage produced per seed {{has been shown}} to vary across the distribution range of a species, in relation with local environmental conditions of the populations.|$|E
