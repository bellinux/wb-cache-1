5|$|In April 2012, state {{officials}} {{released a report}} detailing possible sites for an infill station in East Lyme. Four sites were analyzed – two near downtown Niantic and two at Rocky Neck State Park. Niantic had previously been <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Clamdigger. As part of a bonding proposal made by Governor Malloy, $750,000 would be allocated for a new station at Niantic. A study will be undertaken to analyze the corridor capacity impacts that the station would bring.|$|E

5|$|Vettel {{was again}} fastest in third {{practice}} on Saturday morning, narrowly ahead of Hamilton's Mercedes. Before all drivers {{were able to}} set times on the super-soft tyres, Fernando Alonso coming to <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> start/finish straight brought out a red flag, halting the session. When practice resumed, rain had started to fall, preventing the drivers from improving on their times. Only Force India driver Sergio Pérez set a lap on the faster tyre compound, ending up fourth in the session.|$|E

5|$|Canterbury Castle was {{designed}} by Jeter O. Frye and constructed between 1929 and 1931. Immediately following construction, Frye was unable {{to sell the house}} and left Portland in bankruptcy to resume his career in California. Visitors immediately showed interest in touring the house. The castle attracted paying tourists and school groups, became <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Washington Park bus tour and hosted Halloween parties for a local radio station. The house became known as Canterbury Castle over time due to the plat and name of the street on which it was situated. The terraced garden was eliminated in the 1950s when a portion of the land was sold. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 under the ownership of Dale and Karen Bernards, who had submitted an application for listing one year prior.|$|E
5|$|Galactica departs {{the station}} and rises a chain lift hill. The ride's first drop dips to the right, before rising back up and flying through the ride's centrepiece theming element, a portal, which links to the ride's space theme. Followed by this, riders are turned from the prone {{position}} onto their backs. The coaster then performs a large upward left turn before twisting again, returning riders to the prone position. After exiting from the lie-to-fly element, Galactica passes underneath a small ravine before pitching up, into a tight turn over the plaza area. A 360 degrees inline twist is followed up {{by a series of}} straight flying, and several turns and dips in the track. The train then comes to <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brake run before returning to one of the station's two stations.|$|E
5|$|M-212 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Second Street and the Tromble Trail {{north of the}} entrance to Aloha State Park {{in the community of}} Aloha.

Progressing eastward, M-212 intersects with Third Street and Fourth Street, both of which are just separated by woodlands and residences. To the north of the highway, there is all woodlands and residences. To the south, there are just a few residences. After a while, there is a large clearing, which gives way to a farm to the north and more residences to the south. After the farm there is a large field and M-212 terminates at an intersection with M-33 in Aloha Township.|$|E

5|$|On the 36th lap, Glock's right-rear {{suspension}} failed {{coming out}} of the final corner. He spun through 180 degrees before hitting the pit wall with a strong rearward impact, with debris flying across the track. The car, pointing the wrong way, rolled to <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass. A dazed Glock extracted himself before being treated at the medical centre. The safety car was deployed after the accident. When the pit lane opened on lap38, most drivers headed in, including all of the leaders except Hamilton. McLaren believed that Hamilton had enough fuel to stay out, the plan being for him to then rapidly pull away from his heavily-fuelled rivals, after the safety car went in. Hamilton needed to build up enough of a lead to rejoin still in first position, following his final pit stop. This would prove to be very risky, as Massa rejoined in fourth position, fuelled to the finish.|$|E
