5|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of graph theory, a graph homomorphism is a mapping between two graphs that respects their structure. More concretely, it {{is a function}} between the vertex sets of two graphs that maps <b>adjacent</b> vertices to <b>adjacent</b> vertices.|$|E
5|$|Languages {{spoken in}} a series of dialects occupying <b>adjacent</b> {{territory}} form a dialect continuum or language complex, with some of the dialects being mutually intelligible while others are not. <b>Adjacent</b> dialects typically have relatively high degrees of mutual intelligibility, but the degree of mutual intelligibility between nonadjacent dialects varies considerably. In some cases speakers of nonadjacent dialects may not understand each other's speech.|$|E
5|$|Lindenwood {{purchased}} land <b>adjacent</b> to {{the main}} campus containing various residential properties to create two large student quarters in <b>adjacent</b> neighborhoods, known as the Linden Terraces and First Capitol Houses. The properties offer on-campus housing for married student couples and single-parent students, and are also available to male and female students. Linden Terrace neighborhood lies just southwest from the main campus. First Capitol Houses and the Powell Terrace Residential Area sit east of campus across First Capitol Drive from the main campus.|$|E
5|$|McCosh Health Center, Princeton University's infirmary, is {{situated}} <b>adjacent</b> to Frist, {{and can be}} seen in some shots.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 1976, a bomb {{exploded}} {{on an empty}} electric multiple unit at the station. Eight people in an <b>adjacent</b> train were injured.|$|E
5|$|Other major {{sporting}} and sport-related venues {{located in}} SportCity {{in the immediate}} vicinity of the Etihad Stadium, all legacies of the 2002 Commonwealth Games are the English Institute of Sport, west of the stadium, <b>adjacent</b> to the southwest corner of the Regional Arena; the Manchester Regional Tennis Centre, <b>adjacent</b> to {{the north end of the}} stadium; and the Manchester Tennis & Football Centre, also <b>adjacent</b> to the stadium, which is operated and administered by the Manchester Sport and Leisure Trust.|$|E
5|$|Other nearby lots {{have been}} redeveloped {{as a result}} of the light rail station opening on Capitol Hill. The Broadway Post Office, located <b>adjacent</b> to the south and west entrances, was {{demolished}} in 2016 for the construction of a 44-unit apartment building. An <b>adjacent</b> corner property, already home to a 14-unit apartment building, is planned to be replaced by a 50-unit building. The Bonney-Watson funeral home, located immediately south of the station, was sold for redevelopment in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Princess Elizabeth (died 1597), Gustav Vasa's {{youngest}} daughter {{is buried in}} the Finsta Chapel <b>adjacent</b> to Virgin Mary's Chapel.|$|E
5|$|Some {{additional}} communities such as La Marque, <b>adjacent</b> to Texas City, {{are treated}} as bayside communities by some sources.|$|E
5|$|Steep {{contacts}} between the thick basal breccia of Mount Silverthrone and older crystalline rocks of <b>adjacent</b> peaks {{suggest that the}} breccia {{is part of a}} caldera-fill succession. The presence of irregular subvolcanic intrusions and a profusion of dikes within the breccia—but not in <b>adjacent</b> country rock—provide further evidence of the Silverthrone Caldera. Potassium-argon dates of 750,000 and 400,000 years on rhyolitic lava domes above the basal breccia are consistent with the high rates of uplift and erosion recorded elsewhere in the Coast Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Tennis {{courts and}} a gravel field are {{available}} in the Community Grounds <b>adjacent</b> to the park. Reservations for use are made at the town office.|$|E
5|$|The Greystone campus {{maintains}} the Margie Schubert Library, located <b>adjacent</b> to the school's teaching kitchens.|$|E

5|$|The Southcote Service Station is an Esso petrol {{filling station}} and Tesco Express {{convenience}} store, <b>adjacent</b> to {{which is a}} Nissan dealership.|$|E
5|$|The Thayer School {{shares the}} Murdough Center (containing the Feldberg Business & Engineering Library) with the <b>adjacent</b> Tuck School of Business.|$|E
5|$|The <b>adjacent</b> {{bus stop}} {{is served by}} the First West of England number 76 bus, between Hengrove and Henbury.|$|E
5|$|The one-lane Rapid River Bridge was {{replaced}} by an <b>adjacent</b> two-lane bridge {{in the second quarter}} of 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{property}} was subsequently purchased from the Commonwealth Bank by businessman Alan Bond in 1978 {{along with the}} <b>adjacent</b> Terrace Arcade.|$|E

25|$|Naturally, two {{stones are}} said to be <b>adjacent</b> if they occupy <b>adjacent</b> {{intersection}}s. Similarly, a stone and an intersection are <b>adjacent</b> if the stone occupies an intersection <b>adjacent</b> to that intersection.|$|E
25|$|The New Haven Line {{has nine}} tracks at the station. The {{northern}} platform is <b>adjacent</b> to Tracks 1 and 3. The second platform {{from the north}} is <b>adjacent</b> to Tracks 2 and 4. The second platform from the south is <b>adjacent</b> to Tracks 8 and 10. The southern platform is <b>adjacent</b> to Tracks 12 and 14. Track 6, not <b>adjacent</b> to any platform {{in the center of}} the station, is used only by through trains or idling Shore Line East consists. Tracks 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 don't exist.|$|E
25|$|Hand-Off - Move {{and then}} give the ball to an <b>adjacent</b> player (or just give the ball to an <b>adjacent</b> player).|$|E
25|$|Multiplication {{was done}} by {{mechanisms}} based on the geometry of similar right triangles. Using the trigonometric terms for a right triangle, specifically opposite, <b>adjacent,</b> and hypotenuse, the <b>adjacent</b> side was fixed by construction. One variable changed {{the magnitude of the}} opposite side. In many cases, this variable changed sign; the hypotenuse could coincide with the <b>adjacent</b> side (a zero input), or move beyond the <b>adjacent</b> side, representing a sign change.|$|E
25|$|The heavenly tetrarch cannot move to an <b>adjacent</b> square, and {{has other}} idiosyncrasies; the fire demon 'burns' <b>adjacent</b> pieces. This is best {{described}} below.|$|E
25|$|A {{symmetric}} graph is a graph {{such that}} every pair of <b>adjacent</b> vertices may be mapped by an automorphism into any other pair of <b>adjacent</b> vertices.|$|E
25|$|An {{adjacency}} {{system allows}} certain structures {{to benefit from}} being built directly <b>adjacent</b> to others. Energy-consuming structures will use less energy when built <b>adjacent</b> to power generators and power generators will produce more energy when built <b>adjacent</b> to power storage structures. The same applies to their mass-producing equivalents. Likewise, factories will consume less energy and mass when built <b>adjacent</b> to power generators and mass fabricators/extractors, respectively. However, by placing structures in close proximity, they become more vulnerable to collateral damage if an <b>adjacent</b> structure is destroyed. Furthermore, most resource generation structures can cause chain reactions when destroyed (especially Tier III structures, which produce large amounts of resources but often have large detonations that can wipe out a nearby army).|$|E
25|$|S5: Contains all {{remaining}} vertices {{that have}} degree five, five distinct <b>adjacent</b> vertices, {{and at least}} one <b>adjacent</b> vertex with degree at most six.|$|E
25|$|Foul - Move {{and then}} foul an <b>adjacent</b> {{opposing}} player who is prone (or just foul an <b>adjacent</b> player who is prone).|$|E
