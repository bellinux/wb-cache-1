25|$|Seismic {{retrofitting}} is the {{modification of}} existing structures {{to make them}} more resistant to seismic activity, ground motion, or soil failure due to earthquakes. With better understanding of seismic demand on structures <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> recent experiences with large earthquakes near urban centers, the need of seismic retrofitting is well acknowledged. Prior to the introduction of modern seismic codes in the late 1960s for developed countries (US, Japan etc.) and late 1970s for many {{other parts of the world}} (Turkey, China etc.), many structures were designed without adequate detailing and reinforcement for seismic protection. In view of the imminent problem, various research work has been carried out. State-of-the-art technical guidelines for seismic assessment, retrofit and rehabilitation have been published around the world – such as the ASCE-SEI 41 and the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering (NZSEE)'s guidelines. These codes must be regularly updated; the 1994 Northridge earthquake brought to light the brittleness of welded steel frames, for example.|$|E
500|$|When {{the cast}} of the London musical version of Evita was being decided, Rice and Lloyd Webber {{naturally}} approached Covington to play the titular role. However she chose not to reprise the role. Producer Hal Prince wanted to cast a relatively unknown actress to play Eva, and thus Elaine Paige was signed for the part. In 1977, Rice and Lloyd Webber received the Ivor Novello award {{in the category of}} Best Song Musically and Lyrically. During the 1982 Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina, the song was sometimes played sarcastically by British regimental bands as they deployed to the Falklands. They changed the lyrics, singing it as [...] "You don't frighten me Argentina / The truth is we will defeat you / We'll sink your carrier, with our Sea Harrier / <b>And</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> Sea Kings subs'll be sinking". At the same time the Covington recording was banned from play on the BBC. The song was also banned in the Philippines during the dictatorship (1972–86) of President Ferdinand Marcos. The life of former First Lady Imelda Marcos, Marcos' wife, {{is similar to that of}} Evita Peron. The presentation of the musical Evita was repressed. In the United States, the song is also closely linked with Patti LuPone, who performed the role of Eva in the original Broadway production of the show.|$|E

Gaga {{comes to the}} top of the pillar and sings a combination of [...] "Starstruck" [...] and [...] "LoveGame" [...] as she is joined by her dancers in tracks and jackets and hands Gaga her trademark disco stick. After [...] "LoveGame", she talks a monologue about the year [...] "3009". And says that [...] "The kids came out of New York and shot the paparazzi." [...] followed by saying [...] "It was a thousand years before when the monster first entered the city, vanished for our hearts and for our brains and for our faces (referencing to the three video interludes of the tour)" [...] and [...] "we knew we could co-exist with this monster with our MUSIC!!! With our art <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> fashion. My name is Lady Gaga." [...] and tells the crowd she feels [...] "beautiful and dirty rich" [...] and sang [...] "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich". This leads to the end of the first part wherein a video introduction called [...] "The Brain" [...] starts with Gaga appearing again as Candy Warhol and brushing her hair. After the video ends, Gaga appears on the stage in a black and white leotard with high-pointed [...] "puff" [...] shoulders and lightning shaped symbols, while riding on a similarly colored vespa. She then starts singing [...] "The Fame". This is followed by a speech. Gaga said she's been [...] "travelling the whole world, but when I get back, I can still smell the stench of greed." [...] And then she performs [...] "Money Honey" [...] with the dancers who are wearing backpacks. [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] starts immediately, accompanied by hand-waving and Gaga wore a hat made of toppled dominoes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} of who Soulouque really was is heavily disputed. Virtually no official government records of cabinet meetings exists. According to Latin American scholar Murdo J. MacLeod ("The Soulouque Regime In Haiti -- 1847 - 1859: A Reevaluation.", Caribbean Studies/Vol. 10. No. 3): [...] "We are left with his policies as they are discernible, with {{an assessment of the}} men whom he used to govern, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> evaluation of how correct his appreciation of the situation really was. In every case we must conclude that Faustin Soulouque was a man of high intelligence, a realist, a pragmatist, and a superb, if ruthless politician and diplomat. There is no denying his patriotism and his ability to impose domestic tranquility.".|$|E
2500|$|Newman spelt out his {{theology}} of friendship in a sermon he preached on the Feast of St John the Evangelist, traditionally {{thought to be}} the same person as the disciple John, [...] "whom Jesus loved". In the sermon, Newman said: [...] "There have been men before now, who have supposed Christian love was so diffuse as not to admit of concentration upon individuals; so that we ought to love all men equally. ...Now I shall maintain here, in opposition to such notions of Christian love, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> Saviour's pattern before me, that the best preparation for loving the world at large, and loving it duly and wisely, is to cultivate our intimate friendship and affection towards those who are immediately about us". For Newman, friendship is an intimation of a greater love, a foretaste of heaven. In friendship, two intimate friends gain a glimpse of the life that awaits them in God. Juan R. Vélez writes that someday Newman [...] "may well earn a new title, that of Doctor amicitiae: Doctor of the Church on Friendship. His biography is a treatise on the human and supernatural virtues that make up friendship".|$|E
