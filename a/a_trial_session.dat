40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 55 - 58) The {{purpose of}} this investigation was to determine whether practice of a fine motor task with one limb, under the state of local muscular fatigue, resulted in significantly different bilateral transfer than that which occur?? red in a non-fatigued state. Seventy male volunteers, enrolled in San Fernando Valley State College physical education and recreation activity classes, served as subjects for the study. The subjects were ranked based on their pre-test scores. Group I was the fatigue and practice group, Group II was the practice group, and Group III was the control group. The study lasted for seven weeks, with two practice sessions and one testing session per week. Group I fatigued the dominant arm, using a hand dynamometer, and immediately trained on the star-trace maze for two sessions a week, with five <b>trials</b> <b>a</b> <b>session.</b> Group II trained with the dominant arm on the star-trace maze for two sessions a week, with five <b>trials</b> <b>a</b> <b>session.</b> Group III did not receive any training with the dominant arm. All three groups received one testing session a week with the non-dominant arm, with five <b>trials</b> <b>a</b> <b>session.</b> The data were statistically analyzed using the meantime, error and total(time plus error) scores for each subject. The null hypothesis, stating that performance of fine motor tasks with one limb, while in a state of local fatigue, will not significantly affect the amount of bi?? lateral transfer to the opposite limb, was found to be untenable. The following general conclusion appears to be justified: performance of fine motor tasks with one limb, while in a state of local muscular fatigue, will effect the amount of bilateral transfer to the opposite limb. This effect will be in the form of faster times and lower total(time plus errors) scores...|$|R

Shortly after it had begun, the normally wheelchair-bound Princen appeared to join friends of the defendant. As the trial session was taking place on the third floor, and there was no elevator, many of us were mystified as to how he had made it to the courtroom. [...] As the session ended, it became apparent. With the assistance of friends he had climbed the multiple flights of stairs. I was honoured to be asked among others to help him as he made the slow, painful descent back to the ground floor. His willingness to sacrifice for others, his wisdom and his love for the people of Indonesia, especially the poor, made him a tower of strength for Indonesians in their darkest days. [...] I recall also a conversation in which I joked that it was strange that he had been jailed by both President Soekarno and President Soeharto, and that he had managed also to irritate President Habibie. I said it seemed he was consistently against all Indonesian governments. With his playful smile he responded, [...] "No, you have it wrong; it is that I am always {{on the side of the}} people." [...] I recall finally what he called his [...] "anthem", Edith Piaf's haunting Non, je ne regrette rien. Truly, he had nothing to regret throughout a long and noble life".Ironically, the same Piaf song had been taken up, for diametrically opposite reasons, by members of the French Foreign Legion fighting to preserve colonial rule in Algeria.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes an {{approach}} for the manage-ment of differentiated traffic classes by effectively resorting to different radio channels {{on the same}} mobile phone. It focuses on an application developed in Symbian OS for mobile phone. In particular, the proposed approach uses both a middleware to enable data to be transferred along a heterogeneous network (comprised of Bluetooth and the GPRS technologies), and the UMTS radio channel to run a video-call. The mobile device establishes the best connection available at the moment for data transferring. These access channels are continuously monitored, allowing the device to switch to the Bluetooth interface, whenever this lower-cost alternative is available. Further, the middleware architecture that allows the transparent inter-operability among two different wireless networks during the file transfer is shown. To validate this result, <b>a</b> <b>trial</b> <b>session</b> has been set up, and the packet latency with and without a video-call running is shown, quantifying the delay to accept the call and the packet delivery ratio during a file transfer.
