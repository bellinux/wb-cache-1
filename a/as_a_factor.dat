5|$|Although Johnson was {{friends with}} actors such as David Garrick who had {{performed}} Shakespeare onstage, {{he did not}} believe that performance was vital to the plays, nor did he ever acknowledge the presence of an audience <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the reception of the work. Instead, Johnson believed that the reader of Shakespeare was the true audience of the play.|$|E
5|$|The immune {{response}} of tree sparrows is less robust {{than that of}} the house sparrow and has been proposed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the greater invasive potential of the latter. The house sparrow and tree sparrow are the most frequent victims of roadkill on the roads of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. The maximum recorded age is 13.1 years, but three years is a typical lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetics <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> of well-being. From {{the early}} austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a}} growing sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and it may also be that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting aesthetics.|$|E

5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be {{expressed}} in the human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific. The data that has been provided on gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E
5|$|Because Missouri had {{run aground}} during {{an unusually high}} tide, Wallin {{required}} a date on which the tide would be roughly comparable to {{the conditions under which}} Missouri was grounded in order to free her. The date selected was 2 February. With time <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor,</b> Wallin took charge of the operation and put his five-point plan into motion. With the assistance of Admiral Smith, Wallin was able to assemble a large salvage force which included submarine rescue ships, special salvage ships, divers, and pontoons to add additional buoyancy for the tug boats when the time came to move Missouri.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2007 season, Alston {{competed with}} Ron Warner and Jabari Issa for a {{starting}} {{role on the}} Eskimos. He made the active roster and originally split time with Warner and Robert Brown as a defensive lineman. In August, Alston replaced Adam Braidwood as the starting defensive end, but he was injured with a hip pointer {{in his first game}} in that role. He experienced nagging injury concerns {{for the remainder of the}} season. He finished the season with 11 tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble over six games. The Eskimos released Alston shortly after the end of the 2007. Head coach Danny Maciocia cited Alston's history of injuries <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in his release from the team.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the uproar}} over the poll tax <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in jury selection, the tax {{remained}} in Virginia until the {{ratification of the}} Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution outlawed it in 1964.

5|$|Hitler {{believed}} that Britain's refusal {{to end the}} war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later. He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate them <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor.</b> In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Schmid {{coached the}} Los Angeles Galaxy and the Columbus Crew in MLS, before {{becoming}} {{the head coach}} of Seattle Sounders FC in 2009.

Throughout his career, Schmid has received praise from critics for his ability to identify new talent. His defensive tactics are also highly regarded in the press and often cited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in his success. However, their deployment in his final two seasons with Los Angeles led directly to the termination of his contract.|$|E
5|$|Sullivan's version added {{women to}} the story; there were no {{significant}} female characters in Stevenson's original. The presence of women (especially Jekyll's fiancée, Agnes Carew) placed Jekyll in traditional social relationships, which made him seem more normal by contemporaneous standards. Hyde behaved lecherously towards Agnes and cruelly towards his landlady, and his behavior towards women in this and later adaptations led to new interpretations of the character. In Stevenson's novella and Sullivan's play, Hyde is said to have committed unspecified crimes. Interpreters began to identify the crimes as sexual, positing sexual repression <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in Hyde's characterization. However, Stevenson denied that this was his understanding of the character in his original story.|$|E

The close personal relationship between the then-Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe was also cited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the likeliness of such a deal. In response to the rumours of the Japanese deal, unsolicited proposals were made by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (its Type 216 submarine concept), Saab (an enlarged version of the A26 submarine), and Thales and DCNS (a diesel-electric variant of the Barracuda-class submarine).|$|E
5|$|Between 1974 and 1977, Boycott {{elected to}} make himself {{unavailable}} for England. He claimed in 2006 that he had simply lost his appetite for Test cricket and the stress became too much for him. Boycott's biographer, McKinstry, speculates that the self-imposed exile {{may also have been}} linked to the appointments of Mike Denness and then Tony Greig to the England captaincy, in preference to Boycott. Boycott was very critical of Denness's captaincy and his standard of batting in his autobiography in 1987, citing it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in his decision, along with the pressures at Yorkshire. His weak immune system was a recurring motivation for not touring the Indian subcontinent. This period of exile coincided with the peaks of several fast bowlers' careers, including Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Andy Roberts, and Michael Holding. However, he later came back to face the West Indies pace battery at its most fearsome in the late 70s and early 80s.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted {{early in}} the oral {{argument}} that the case presented two questions. First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA. California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court precedent was not necessary {{because he thought it}} obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave. John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued that age doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should not be required to get inside the head of each suspect.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the events}} of the summer, Alonso made a {{confident}} start to the season and both his peers and the press praised his strength of character, citing his influence <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the team's strong opening to the season. Alonso's importance to the team was further underlined when he scored the only goal, through a deflection, in a 0–1 victory against Chelsea, making Liverpool the first away team to win at Stamford Bridge in over four years. Statistical analysis reflected Alonso's good form: on 11 December, figures from Opta Sports revealed that he was the first Premier League player to complete 1,000 successful passes in the season. His last goal for Liverpool came in their 1–3 away win at Hull City on 25 April, striking after his free kick deflected off the Hull wall.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{armistice}} on 27July 1953, the squadron remained in South Korea on garrison duties—initially at Kimpo, later at Kunsan—until transferring to Iwakuni on 12October 1954. It departed for Australia on 19November and arrived in Sydney on 3December, having been based overseas for eleven years, {{a record for}} an RAAF unit. Its performance {{in the early days}} of the war has been cited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the United States' decision to ratify the ANZUS treaty in September 1951. The squadron's casualty rate in Korea was twenty-five percent killed or captured. Forty-one pilots died, thirty-five from the RAAF and six on exchange from the Royal Air Force. A further seven pilots became prisoners of war. Aircraft losses totalled almost sixty, including over forty Meteors, mostly to ground fire. The squadron flew 18,872 sorties, including 3,872 in Mustangs and 15,000 in Meteors. It was credited with shooting down five MiG-15s and destroying 3,700 buildings, 1,408 vehicles, ninety-eight railway engines and carriages, and sixteen bridges.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{was founded}} in 1989 by George Rathmann, Robert Nowinski, and Christopher Henney, each of whom had {{previously}} started another biotechnology company: Rathmann had created Amgen; Nowinski had launched Genetic Systems, later sold to Bristol-Myers Squibb; and Henney co-founded Immunex, later sold to Amgen. Icos was formed {{with the goal of}} developing new drugs to treat the underlying causes of inflammatory diseases and halt the disease process in the early stages. The name Icos comes from icosahedron, a 20-sided polyhedron, which is the shape of many viruses, and was chosen because the founders originally thought retroviruses might be involved in inflammation. The founders raised $33million in July1990 from many investors, including Bill Gates– who at the time was the largest shareholder, with 10% of the equity. The company initially had temporary offices in downtown Seattle, but moved to Bothell in September1990. Icos went public on June6, 1991, raising $36million. George Rathmann, seen as a guiding father to Icos, left the company in February2000, and was replaced as CEO and chairman by Paul Clark, a former executive at Abbott Laboratories. A former Icos manager named short-sighted leadership by Clark <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the failure of the company to develop any other successful drugs apart from Cialis.|$|E
