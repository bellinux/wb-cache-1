5000|$|PEG is {{also used}} as an <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent</b> in food - its INS number is 1521 or E1521 in the EU.|$|E
5000|$|Simethicone, {{combined}} with loperamide in some formulations, is an <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent</b> {{used to reduce}} bloating, discomfort or pain caused by excessive gas.|$|E
5000|$|Surfactants play an {{important}} role as cleaning, wetting, dispersing, emulsifying, foaming and <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agents</b> in many practical applications and products, including: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Anti-foam</b> <b>agents</b> (defoamants) {{inhibit the}} {{production}} of air bubbles and foam in the oil which can cause a loss of lubrication, pitting, and corrosion where entrained air and combustion gases contact metal surfaces.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{ingredients}} of jelly beans include sugar, corn syrup, and pectin or starch. Relatively minor {{amounts of the}} emulsifying <b>agent</b> lecithin, <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agents,</b> an edible wax such as beeswax, salt, and confectioner's glaze are also included. The ingredients that give each bean its character are also relatively small in proportion and may {{vary depending on the}} flavor.|$|R
50|$|Processing {{requires}} {{the use of}} an <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent</b> or natural defoamer during the boiling step. Bringing filtered soy milk to a boil avoids the problem of foaming. It is generally opaque, white or off-white in color, and approximately the same consistency as cow's milk.|$|E
50|$|Steam {{locomotives}} {{usually do}} not have condensers so the feedwater is not recycled and water consumption is high. The use of deionized water would be prohibitively expensive so other types of water treatment are used. Chemicals employed typically include sodium carbonate, sodium bisulfite, tannin, phosphate and an <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
50|$|Commercially, {{behenic acid}} {{is often used}} to give hair conditioners and moisturizers their {{smoothing}} properties. It is also used in lubricating oils, and as a solvent evaporation retarder in paint removers. Its amide is used as an <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent</b> in detergents, floor polishes and dripless candles. Reduction of behenic acid yields behenyl alcohol.|$|E
30|$|The basic {{chemistry}} of the solder masks was an epoxy acrylate dual cure system (bisphenol-A based epoxy and methyl methacrylate) with typical photoimageable solder mask formulations, including photoinitiators, thermal curing agents, silica-filler, pigment and several organic solvents. Solder mask type A was cured with an anhydride and solder mask type B was cured with an amine. Additionally, both solder mask formulations contained additives, like PDMS-based <b>anti-foaming</b> and wetting <b>agents,</b> which {{are introduced to}} impact specific properties of the solder masks. <b>Anti-foaming</b> <b>agents</b> contribute to the solder mask performance in a curtain coating application process [1].|$|R
50|$|Some {{silicone}} oils, such as simethicone, are potent <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agents</b> due {{to their}} low surface tension. They are used in industrial applications such as distillation or fermentation, where excessive amounts of foam can be problematic. They are sometimes added to cooking oils to prevent excessive frothing during deep frying. Silicone oils used as lubricants can be inadvertent defoamers (contaminants) in processes where foam is desired, {{such as in the}} manufacture of polyurethane foam.|$|R
50|$|Electrically {{conductive}} {{fabric softener}} chemicals may also prevent static charge buildup in clothes dryers. Other functions manufacturers claim include less friction during ironing, increased stain resistance, reduced wrinkling and pilling, and lower drying time. Most contain fragrances. Cationic fabric softeners are added during the rinse cycle {{rather than the}} wash cycle because they can interfere with detergent cleaning action. In addition to fabric softening chemicals, fabric softeners may include acids or bases to maintain optimal pH for absorption, silicone-based <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agents,</b> emulsion stabilizers, fragrances, and colors.|$|R
50|$|Inhalation of vapor {{obtained}} by nebulization {{of water and}} ethanol in oxygen {{has been used in}} treatment of pulmonary edema in humans. Alcohol vapor acts as an <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent</b> in the lungs, so the sputum becomes more liquid, and can be easily expelled. The method has also been used to reduce the alcohol withdrawal syndrome in patients who had intestinal tract surgeries.|$|E
5000|$|Simethicone is an orally {{administered}} <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent</b> used {{to reduce}} bloating, discomfort or pain caused by excessive gas [...] - [...] mainly swallowed air, with small amounts of hydrogen and methane - [...] in the stomach or intestines. In addition to that, it is administered orally after intoxication with detergents. Simethicone {{is a mixture of}} polydimethylsiloxane and hydrated silica gel.|$|E
50|$|A {{defoamer}} or an <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent</b> is {{a chemical}} additive that reduces and hinders {{the formation of}} foam in industrial process liquids. The terms anti-foam agent and defoamer are often used interchangeably. Commonly used agents are insoluble oils, polydimethylsiloxanes and other silicones, certain alcohols, stearates and glycols. The additive is used to prevent formation of foam or is added to break a foam already formed.|$|E
40|$|Mass {{transfer}} {{rates were}} measured {{in a large}} scale system, which consisted of an 8. 4 meter tall by 0. 76 meter diameter column containing one of three fluids: water with an <b>anti-foam</b> <b>agent,</b> water without an <b>anti-foam</b> <b>agent,</b> and AZ 101 simulant, which simulated a non-Newtonian nuclear waste. The testing contributed to the evaluation of large scale mass transfer of hydrogen in nuclear waste tanks. Due to its radioactivity, the waste was chemically simulated, and due to flammability concerns oxygen was used in lieu of hydrogen. Different liquids were used to better understand the mass transfer processes, where each of the fluids was saturated with oxygen, and the oxygen was then removed from solution as air bubbled up, or sparged, through the solution {{from the bottom of the}} column. Air sparging was supplied by a single tube which was co-axial to the column, the decrease in oxygen concentration was recorded, and oxygen measurements were then used to determine the mass transfer coefficients to describe the rate of oxygen transfer from solution. Superficial, average, sparging velocities of 2, 5, and 10 mm/second were applied to each of the liquids at three different column fill levels, and mass transfer coefficient test results are presented here for combinations of superficial velocities and fluid levels...|$|R
40|$|Gas holdup {{tests were}} {{performed}} in bench-scale and small-scale mechanically-agitated mixing systems at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) for a simulant of waste from the Hanford Tank 241 -AZ- 101. These featured additions of DOW Corning Q 2 - 3183 A <b>anti-foam</b> <b>agent.</b> Results {{indicated that this}} <b>anti-foam</b> <b>agent</b> (AFA) increased gas holdup in the waste simulant by about a factor of four and, counter-intuitively, that the holdup increased as the non-newtonian simulant shear strength decreased (apparent viscosity decreased). Such results raised the potential of increased flammable gas retention in Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) vessels mixed by air sparging and pulse-jet mixers (PJMs) during a Design Basis Event (DBE). Additional testing was performed {{to determine the effects}} of simulant properties, composition of alternate AFAs, and presence of trace noble metals. Key results are that: (1) Increased gas holdup resulting from addition of Q 2 - 3183 A is due to a decrease in surface tension that supports small bubbles which have low rise velocities. (2) Dow Corning 1520 -US AFA shows it to be a viable replacement to Dow Corning Q 2 - 3183 A AFA. This alternative AFA, however, requires significantly higher dosage for the same anti-foam function. (3) Addition of noble metals to the AZ- 101 waste simulant does not produce a catalytic gas retention effect with the AFA...|$|R
30|$|Several {{studies for}} ink {{additives}} and performance additives that {{would improve the}} print properties of water-based ink formulations [2]. Three additives generally used: (1) surfactants, (2) defoamers and (3) waxes. Surfactants are added to reduce the surface tension of water-based inks to allow adhesion on nonporous substrates; however, the presence of surfactants in the formulation results to production of stable foam during mixing. To address this problem, defoamers or <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agents</b> are also added used as additives together with the surfactants in the formulations of printing inks. On the other hand, waxes are used to impart essential surface properties such as abrasion resistance.|$|R
50|$|Rendered lard {{can be used}} {{to produce}} biofuel and soap. Lard is also useful as a cutting fluid in {{machining}}. Its use in machining has declined since the mid-20th century as other specially engineered cutting fluids became prominent. However it is still a viable option. Lard and other animal fats were formerly used as an <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent</b> in industrial fermentation processes such as brewing; there, animal fats have been superseded by polyethers.|$|E
50|$|Simethicone is an <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent</b> that {{decreases}} the surface tension of gas bubbles, {{causing them to}} combine into larger bubbles in the stomach that can be passed more easily. Simethicone does not reduce or prevent the formation of gas in the digestive tract; rather, it increases {{the rate at which}} it exits the body. Simethicone can relieve pain caused by gas in the intestines by decreasing foaming, which then allows for easier passing of flatulence.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{commercial}} use of dimethyl methylphosphonate is as a flame retardant. Other {{commercial use}}s are a preignition additive for gasoline, <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent,</b> plasticizer, stabilizer, textile conditioner, antistatic agent, and an additive for solvents and low-temperature hydraulic fluids. It {{can be used}} as a catalyst and a reagent in organic synthesis, as it can generate a highly reactive ylide. The yearly production in the United States varies between 100 and 1000 ST.|$|E
30|$|Batch {{fermentation}} {{was carried}} out in a 2  L BIOSTAT® Bplus stirred tank reactor (Sartorius Stedim System GmbH, Guxhagen, Germany) with a working volume of 1.5  L. The basal salts were dissolved in 1200  mL ddH 2 O and were autoclaved in the bioreactor. Also, a few drops of the <b>anti-foam</b> <b>agent</b> Pluronic® PE 8100 (BASF SE, Ludwigshafen, Germany) were added before fermentation started. Likewise, 300  mL of a carbon source stock solution (75  g carbon source) were autoclaved separately and were inoculated with 7.5 × 108 aerial conidia (5.0 × 104 spores/mL). To start the fermentation, the inoculum suspension was added to the bioreactor. Temperature was maintained at 25 °C and fermentation time was between 8 – 10 days.|$|R
30|$|Fed-batch {{cultures}} {{were performed}} in a 5 -L fermenter (Sartorius, Germany) with conditions set to optimize growth and (R)- 3 -HB production. The temperature was maintained at 30  °C and a pH of 6.0 was controlled {{by the addition of}} 2.5  M NaOH or 1  M H 2 SO 4. The level of oxygen was established at pO 2  =  1 % (glucose feeding) or pO 2  =  40 % (ethanol feeding) and maintained by the stirring rate. The culture was started in YPD followed by the addition of glucose and nitrogen to prevent the depletion of glucose and to maintain the metabolism of the organism. Foaming was reduced by the controlled addition of a silicone-based <b>anti-foam</b> <b>agent</b> (Strunktol SB 304, Schill + Seilacher GmbH, Germany).|$|R
50|$|Red inks usually {{contain the}} dye Eosin. Blue inks often contain Triarylmethane dye. Black inks are mixtures. In {{addition}} to water, the non-dye components (collectively {{referred to as}} the vehicle) might include polymeric resins, humectants to retard premature drying, pH modifiers, <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agents,</b> biocides to prevent fungal and bacterial growth, and wetting agents (surfactants). Surfactants reduce the surface tension of the ink; distilled water has a surface tension of 72 dyn/cm (72 × 10−3 N/m), but the desirable value for ink is between 38 and 45 dyn/cm (38 to 45 × 10−3 N/m). If the ink's surface tension were too high, then it would not flow through the pen; if it were too low, then the ink would run out of the pen with less control.|$|R
50|$|As {{it has no}} odour, {{it finds}} use as <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent</b> in {{detergent}} solutions, and in various emulsions, paints, and adhesives. It is also found as a defoamer in ethylene glycol-borax antifreeze solutions. In oil-based lubricants addition of TBP increases the oil film strength. It is used also in mercerizing liquids, where it improves their wetting properties. It is also used as a heat exchange medium. TBP is used in some consumer products such as herbicides and water thinned paints and tinting bases.|$|E
50|$|As of August 1, 2016, the {{ingredients}} within the United States are as follows: White boneless chicken, water, salt, seasoning (yeast extract, salt, wheat starch, natural flavoring, safflower oil, lemon juice solids, dextrose, citric acid), sodium phosphates. Battered and breaded with water, enriched flour (bleached wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), yellow corn flour, bleached wheat flour, salt, leavening (baking soda, sodium acid pyrophosphate, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate, calcium lactate), spices, wheat starch, dextrose, corn starch. Prepared {{in vegetable oil}} (canola oil, corn oil, soybean oil, hydrogenated soybean oil) with TBHQ and citric acid as preservatives and dimethylpolysiloxane as an <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent.</b> McDonald's ingredients can vary outside of the US. McDonald's announced that its Chicken McNuggets are now free of artificial preservatives, a change that the fast food giant {{has been working on}} for about a year.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{over-the-counter}} (OTC) medications {{that can be}} used to treat bloating. Food enzymes can be found in some products that will help break down the sugars found in grains, vegetables and dairy products. They can be taken before food is consumed or added to the food that causes the gas and bloating. Another type of medicine is activated charcoal tablets which decrease the odor from gas. The most common treatment is antacids. These medications have no effect on the gas that is presently in the intestines, but enable gas build-up to be belched away more easily, reducing the amount of bloating that develops. Another treatment is Simethicone, an oral <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent</b> that helps the body to expel the gas more quickly.Also combinations of prokinetics, such as domperidone + metoclopramide + diphenhydramine (the latter for the prevention of extrapyramidal reactions, especially acute dystonic reactions) + proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), have dramatic effects on bloaters and belchers especially.|$|E
5000|$|Foam, in {{this case}} meaning [...] "bubbly liquid", is also {{produced}} as an often-unwanted by-product {{in the manufacture of}} various substances. For example, foam is a serious problem in the chemical industry, especially for biochemical processes. Many biological substances, for example proteins, easily create foam on agitation or aeration. Foam is a problem because it alters the liquid flow and blocks oxygen transfer from air (thereby preventing microbial respiration in aerobic fermentation processes). For this reason, <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agents,</b> like silicone oils, are added to prevent these problems. Chemical methods of foam control are not always desired with respect to the problems (i.e., contamination, reduction of mass transfer) they may cause especially in food and pharmaceutical industries, where the product quality is of great importance. Mechanical methods to prevent foam formation are more common than chemical ones.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Lubricating {{properties}} of the lubricant is generally evaluated by the friction and wear testing machine. In this paper, by using Four-ball test machine to measure the maximum non-card bite load value (PB), wear scar diameter (WSD) and Pd 1. 0, Pd 2. 0 value. The uniform design of experiments is firstly used for arranging multi-level and multi-factor experiments. The stepwise technique is adopted to put forward the regression equation. The compatibility of Nano-ceramic and T 106 both additives is studied {{by a series of}} tests to improve the efficiency of use of lubricants. In order to make automotive engine oil achieve the desired results, there are some additives that include detergents, dispersants, anti corrosion agents, oiliness agents, antioxidants, viscosity index improvers, pour point depressants and <b>anti-foam</b> <b>agent.</b> There have extremely complex interactions between these additives. Between different additives not only produce the synergistic effect but als...|$|R
30|$|Esters, ketones and ether esters are {{suitable}} solvents for clear and pigmented PU coating systems. Traditional extenders, such as barytes, calcium carbonate, talc, kaolin, mica, and silica {{may be used}} in one- and two-component systems. Among the conventional inorganic pigments, titanium dioxide, titanium yellow, various iron oxides, cadmium reds and yellows, some carbon blacks and chrome oxide green {{are suitable}} for most of the 2 K PU systems. Organic pigments frequently found in the PU paint formulations, include quinocridone and perylene reds, monoazo and isoindoline yellows, and phthalocyanine blues and greens. The use of organic pigments from other classes may involve undesirable effects on the curing process of PU paint films [10]. Commercial PU coatings contain various additives, such as catalysts, flattening, leveling, thickening and <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agents.</b> The presence of catalysts offers advantageous rates of polyurethanes reaction at lower temperatures. Those used in PU industry essentially consist on tertiary amines and tin complexes compounds [9].|$|R
5000|$|The 2004 {{documentary}} Super Size Me {{states that}} [...] "originally created from old chickens that {{can no longer}} lay eggs, McNuggets are now made from chickens with unusually large breasts. They're stripped from the bone, and ground-up {{into a sort of}} 'chicken mash', which is then combined with all sorts of stabilizers and preservatives, pressed into familiar shapes, breaded, deep-fried, freeze-dried, and then shipped to a McDonald's near you." [...] Super Size Me also alleged inclusion of chemicals such as TBHQ (a phenolic antioxidant used as a chemical preservative), polydimethylsiloxane (a type of silicone used as an <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent)</b> and other ingredients not used by a typical home cook. This was subsequently restated by CNN. Marion Nestle, a New York University professor and author of What to Eat, says that the two said ingredients in McNuggets probably pose no health risks. As a general rule, though, she advocates not eating any food with an ingredient that is difficult for one to pronounce.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} contribution, the {{properties}} of dipropylene glycol isobornyl ether (Pribelance) are discussed, esp. {{in the context of}} microemulsion and emulsion formulations. Pribelance is a new low-toxic anti-foaming hydrotrope with excellent co-surfactant properties that has some similarities with long-chain alcs., but in contrast to them, it is liq. at room temp. In combination with another, more hydrophilic co-surfactant, it allows significant amts. of oil to be solubilized in water. Possible applications such as in cosmetics, as an <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent</b> or as additive to cooling lubricants are discussed. Further potential applications are plasticizers, fermn. systems, agrochems. and waste-water treatments...|$|E
40|$|From {{the results}} {{obtained}} in this study, it is concluded that the quantity of bubbles that PC-n, which is polycarboxylate having poly (n) ethylene glycol groups as side chains, introduces in concrete can be reduced when the side chains' length 'n' {{is designed to be}} longer than 25 mol. But basically it is suggested that PC-n would have the air entraining performance in itself; By using the specific AE agent and <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agent,</b> the stable bubbles can replace the unstable ones PC- 10 introduced in concrete. As a result the excellently durable concrete can be manufactured that maintains the relative dynamic Young's modulus beyond 90 % till about 1, 200 cycles...|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to produce baths with bubbles simultaneously in {{and on top of}} the water (as in a poured beer), but the combination has not been popular. Mechanical aeration of a foam bath may produce much more foam than is sought—the Internet is replete with first hand accounts and sometimes photographs of such experiences—and many mechanically aerated baths are hot tubs which are shared and not drained between uses and so are desired to be kept free of non-maintenance materials. Mechanically aerated baths for tissue debridement of burn victims typically have added <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agents</b> to counteract the film-forming properties that some medicinal additives have as a side effect, but the anti-foam is sometimes omitted or reduced for children to give them more of a pleasant distraction during debridement. Bath fizzies that also foam tend to produce disappointingly little foam when allowed to do so from their own fizz, and aeration of the water loses the gas from the fizz.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWithin {{the context}} of the ESA FOAM project, we have studied the {{stability}} of aqueous and non-aqueous foams both on Earth and in microgravity. Foams are dispersions of gas into liquid or solid newtorks. On Earth, the lifetime of a foam is limited by the gravitationnal drainage. By drainage, we are referring to the irreversible flow of liquid through the foam (leading to the accumulation of liquid at the foam bottom, and to a global liquid content decreases within the foam). When the liquid films become thinner, they eventually break, and the foam collapses. In microgravity, this process is no more present and foams containing large amounts of liquid can be studied for longer time. While the difference between foaming and not-foaming solutions is clear, the case of slightly-foaming solutions is more complicated. On Earth, such mixtures are observed to produce unstable froth for a couple of seconds. However, these latter solutions may produce foam in microgravity. We have studied both configurations for different solutions composed of common surfactant, proteins, <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agents</b> or silicon oil. Surprising results have been obtained, emphasizing the role played by gravity on the foam stabilizaiton process...|$|R
50|$|In 2004, the {{electronics}} side was improved greatly with the introductions of Electronic Throttle Control, electronically controlled transmissions, and transient engine and transmission controls. In addition, computing power was vastly increased. A solenoid {{control valve assembly}} integrated into the engine valley cover contains solenoid valves that provide a pressurized oil signal to specially designed hydraulic roller lifters provided by Eaton Corp. and Delphi. These lifters disable and re-enable exhaust and intake valve operation to deactivate and reactivate engine cylinders https://web.archive.org/web/20061029082032/http://www.gm.com/company/onlygm/fuel/engine.html. Unlike the first generation system, {{only half of the}} cylinders can be deactivated. It is notable that the second generation system uses engine oil to hydraulically modulate engine valve function. As a result, the system is dependent upon the quality of the oil in the engine. As <b>anti-foaming</b> <b>agents</b> in engine oil are depleted, air may become entrained or dissolve in the oil, delaying the timing of hydraulic control signals. Similarly engine oil viscosity and cleanliness is a factor. Use of the incorrect oil type, i.e. SAE 20W40 instead of SAE 20W50, or the failure to change engine oil at factory recommended intervals can also significantly impair system performance.|$|R
