5000|$|There is no mining {{process in}} Billon architecture, instead the genesis blocks in Billon's {{blockchain}} {{are created by}} <b>authorised</b> <b>issuer,</b> in this case licensed banks. All the users need a software that contains public keys of the issuers. Also this application just like bitcoin wallet, has {{to be capable of}} parsing Billon's digital blockchain format and verifying signatures on incoming and outgoing money. Most importantly, both the sending and receiving party have to register their public keys at the issuing bank. This is done automatically during registration process. To set up, every user of the system chooses login name and generates its own private keys which are presented to the bank for authentication. Once the one-time registration process is completed, the software automates all the cryptography and the user is only required to click [...] "Yes" [...] or [...] "No" [...] to confirm payment.|$|E
