5|$|Wolf and coyote {{packs and}} the solitary cougar {{are the most}} likely predators, {{although}} brown and black bears also prey on elk. Coyote packs mostly prey on elk calves, though they can sometimes take a winter-weakened adult. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem which includes Yellowstone National Park, bears are the most significant predators of calves. Major predators in Asia include the wolf, dhole, brown bear, Siberian tiger, <b>Amur</b> <b>leopard,</b> and snow leopard. Eurasian lynx and wild boar sometimes prey on Asian elk calves. Historically, tigers in the Lake Baikal region fed on Manchurian wapiti, and continue {{to do so in the}} Amur region.|$|E

2500|$|The Acacia Woodland exhibit {{features}} a leopard exhibit, {{a troop of}} vervet monkeys, and an aviary. The leopard does not feature the African subspecies of leopard, however.

The San Diego Zoo participates in the <b>Amur</b> <b>leopard</b> Species Survival Plan, a breeding program that focuses on preserving the genetics of the endangered cat. The Acacia Woodland exhibit will allow the Zoo to have more breeding spaces for the cats.|$|E
