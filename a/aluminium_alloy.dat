5|$|External {{cleaning}} {{may also}} be required to remove contaminants, corrosion products or old paint or other coatings. Methods which remove the minimum amount of structural material are indicated. Solvents, detergents and bead blasting are generally used. Removal of coatings by the application of heat may render the cylinder unserviceable by affecting the crystalline microstructure structure of the metal. This is a particular hazard for <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> cylinders, {{which may not be}} exposed to temperatures above those stipulated by the manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|Gary Klein, born , {{attended}} the University of California at Davis before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). During the Independent Activities Period in 1973, {{a group of}} students including Klein worked together under Professor Buckley to produce an aluminum framed bicycle. After analyzing a number of contemporary steel frames, and examining ones that had broken in use, they were able to determine the stresses placed on a bicycle frame. Faced with limited available types of aluminum alloy tubing, the students chose to construct frames from 6061 <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> seamless drawn tube; alternatives such as the stronger 7075 aluminum alloy were discarded because of the tubing dimensions.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} work {{is focused}} on description of characteristics and uses of <b>aluminium</b> and its <b>alloys</b> in foundry industry. The author briefly focuses with technical pure aluminium, and then describes the characteristics, distribution and technology of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> After the basic characteristics of all major <b>aluminium</b> casting <b>alloys,</b> the author mentions the use of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> {{in a variety of}} industrial sectors...|$|R
5000|$|The National Physical Laboratory began {{a series}} of {{experiments}} to study new <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> Experimental series [...] "Y" [...] was successful, and gave its name to the new alloy. Like duralumin, this was a 4% copper alloy, but with the addition of 2% nickel and 1.5% magnesium. This addition of nickel was an innovation for <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> These alloys are one of the three main groups of high-strength <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys,</b> the nickel-aluminium alloys having the advantage of retaining strength at high temperatures.|$|R
5|$|The BT46 was an <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> {{monocoque}} {{featuring the}} trapezoidal cross section common {{to many of}} Gordon Murray’s 1970s designs. It featured inbuilt pneumatic jacks fed from an external supply of compressed air to lift it off the ground for tyre changes during practice. It employed a very early version of the carbon brakes that were in universal use by the mid-1980s—a concept taken from the aircraft industry. The system, which Brabham had been developing since 1976, combined carbon composite brake pads with a steel disc faced with carbon composite 'pucks'.|$|E
5|$|The car was {{initially}} designed in 1979 as a short notice {{replacement for the}} team's Alfa Romeo-engined BT48, after Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone decided to end {{his relationship with the}} Italian engine manufacturer. The BT49 was created in only six weeks using elements of the BT48 chassis together with the widely used Cosworth DFV engine. It is a single seater with an open cockpit and exposed wheels. The monocoque chassis is made from <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> and carbon fibre composites. The car was fitted with controversial hydropneumatic suspension and water-cooled brakes at different points in its life.|$|E
5|$|Air {{compression}} on {{the outer}} surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch {{by the end of}} the flight. Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the nose, due to aerodynamic heating. The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy,</b> throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02. Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing. The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is {{investigate}} the friction stir welding capability of the EN AW 2024 - 0 and EN AW 5754 -H 22 Al alloys are studied, because two <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> are widely used in the industry and friction stir welding is getting widened to be used to join the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Friction stir welding (FSW) is a new solid fhase technique invented and patented for <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> EN AW 2024 - 0 and EN AW 5754 -H 22 are <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> can be welded by fusion welding, but many welding problems arises from fusion welding. While the friction stir welding is a solid state welding process, some problems may be prevented. Findings: It is found in the course that these two <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> can be friction stir welded if fhe welding parameters are carefully selected. Hardness value in weld area for EN AW 2024 - 0, there is an increase about 10 - 40 Hv. Because of this is recrystalization and getting smaller grains. For EN AW 5754 -H 22 there is a decrease of hardness value because of recrystalization. Welding performance of EN AW 2024 - 0 is reached to 96. 6 %. This value is 57 % for EN AW 5754 -H 22. It is possible to perform dissimilar welding using different <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> elding performance of dissimilar <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> EN AW 2024 - 0 and EN AW 5754 -H 22 is reached a value of 66. 39 %. Research limitations/implications: Research limitations are that the design of the welding probe which is used in the experiments is changed, the speed of the welding can be improved. The material of the welding probe can be changed. Originality/value: The <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> EN AW 2024 - 0 and EN AW 5754 -H 22 are widely used ones but the friction stir weldability is not investigated so far. It is found that if the welding parameters are carefully selected, these <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> can be friction stir welded succesfuly...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} structural {{limitation of}} <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> is their lower fatigue strength compared to steel. In controlled laboratory conditions, steels display a fatigue limit, {{which is the}} stress amplitude below which no failures occur - the metal does not continue to weaken with extended stress cycles. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> do not have this lower fatigue limit {{and will continue to}} weaken with continued stress cycles. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> are therefore sparsely used in parts that require high fatigue strength in the high cycle regime (more than 107 stress cycles).|$|R
5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|E

40|$|Commercial alloys are {{continuously}} {{developed to}} improve their performance. Therefore {{it is important to}} develop new optimisation software, which could be used in development of new materials or in materials selection. In this study the mechanical properties which are important in materials selection in mechanical design are investigated. Two types of materials are analysed, <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> and stainless steels but focus will be on the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> Thermodynamic analysis has been used to evaluate the effect of the microstructure. Solid solution hardening has been successfully modelled for both <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> and stainless steels and follows the theories by Labusch and Nabarro. The precipitation hardening is most dominant for the hardenable <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys,</b> but the non-hardenable alloys also increase their strength from precipitation hardening. The non-hardenable alloys are divided into tempers, which differ in the amount of strain hardening. This has also been modelled successfully. Combining these fundamental results with multiple regression, models for mechanical properties have been created. Separate models are developed for wrought <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> and stainless steels. For the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> this includes the solid solution hardening and the precipitation hardening. For the stainless steels the thickness, nitrogen content and ferrite content are included together with the solid solution hardening. QC 2010112...|$|R

50|$|Another {{important}} {{property of}} <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> is sensitivity to heat. Workshop procedures are {{complicated by the}} fact that aluminium, unlike steel, melts without first glowing red. Manual blow torch operations require additional skill and experience. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>alloys,</b> like all structural alloys, are subject to internal stresses after heat operations such as welding and casting. The lower melting points of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> make them more susceptible to distortions from thermally induced stress relief. Stress can be relieved and controlled during manufacturing by heat-treating the parts in an oven, followed by gradual cooling—in effect annealing the stresses.|$|R

25|$|The {{standard}} {{brakes on}} the RS4 are of two-piece construction. The cast iron discs are cross-drilled and radially ventilated and float on <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> disc hubs.

50|$|The {{addition}} of scandium to aluminium creates nanoscale Al3Sc precipitates which limit the excessive grain growth {{that occurs in}} the heat-affected zone of welded aluminium components. This has two beneficial effects: the precipitated Al3Sc forms smaller crystals than are formed in other <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> and the width of precipitate-free zones that normally exist at the grain boundaries of age-hardenable <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> is reduced. Scandium is also a potent grain refiner in cast <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys,</b> and atom for atom, the most potent strengthener in aluminium, both {{as a result of}} grain refinement and precipitation strengthening.|$|R
50|$|One {{important}} structural {{limitation of}} <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> is their fatigue strength. Unlike steels, <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> have no well-defined fatigue limit, meaning that fatigue failure eventually occurs, under even very small cyclic loadings. Engineers must assess applications and {{design for a}} fixed and finite life of the structure, rather than infinite life.|$|R

25|$|The {{airframe}} of the P.8 continued Pulawski's {{theme of}} semi-monocoque stressed skin <b>Aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> structure with fabric covered control surfaces. The wings were built up around two I-section <b>Aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> spars with alloy ribs and finely corrugated sheet Duralumin. High set gull style wings {{were attached to}} the upper fuselage with about 5 degrees dihedral out to the joint between centre-section and outer wings which had zero dihedral. Support for the wings came from pairs of struts attached to the lower fuselage and at the thickest section of the outer wings at about 1/3span. A fixed tail-wheel undercarriage consisted of strut mounted mainwheels attached to the fuselage at the wing strut attachment points and a steel shod tail-skid. Cooling for the engine was achieved by a large radiator bath under the rear fuselage on the P.8/I and by special surface heat exchangers under the rear fuselage of the P.8/II. The special heat exchangers caused cooling difficulties and were replaced by small radiators {{either side of the}} rear fuselage aft of the cockpit.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} take {{advantage}} of the potential of new high strength <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> for corrosion fatigue loaded components, it is of importance to qualify their suitability regarding superposed mechanical and corrosive loadings prior to established validation tests such as the structural durability proof. Up to now selection of potential <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> for chassis applications is based on stand-alone mechanical and fatigue properties as well as a wide range of alloy-specific corrosion tests not taking into account simultaneous cyclic mechanical and corrosive loadings occurring in service. Within this paper, approaches comprising fatigue testing in air, pre-corrosion with consecutive fatigue testing and corrosion fatigue tests are discussed regarding their suitability to assess the behaviour of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> under operating conditions. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> of different alloy series with different sensitisation conditions towards corrosion are included in this review...|$|R
