25|$|However, it is {{important}} to note that self-reported and Trait EI measures retain a fair amount of predictive validity for job performance after controlling Big Five traits and IQ. Newman, Joseph, and MacCann contend that the greater predictive validity of Trait EI measures is due to their inclusion of content related to <b>achievement</b> <b>motivation,</b> self efficacy, and self-rated performance. Meta-analytic evidence confirms that self-reported emotional intelligence predicting job performance is due to mixed EI and trait EI measures' tapping into self-efficacy and self-rated performance, in addition to the domains of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and IQ. As such, the predictive ability of mixed EI to job performance drops to nil when controlling for these factors.|$|E

To address this question, we test the male pragmatism hypothesis, which posits that men {{rely on their}} social and <b>achievement</b> <b>motivations</b> to set ethical standards more so than women. Across two studies, motivation was both manipulated and measured before examining ethicality judgments. Study 1 manipulated identification with two parties in an ethical dilemma and found that men were more egocentric than women. Whereas men’s ethicality judgments were affected by the identification manipulation, women’s judgments were not. Study 2 examined whether implicit negotiation beliefs, which predict <b>achievement</b> <b>motivations</b> to either demonstrate or develop negotiating skill, predicted ethicality judgments and, if so, whether this relationship was moderated by gender. As hypothesized, fixed beliefs predicted lower ethical standards, particularly for men. In combination, these findings suggest men are more pragmatic in setting ethical standards than women...|$|R
25|$|Internals were {{believed}} by Rotter (1966) to exhibit two essential characteristics: high <b>achievement</b> <b>motivation</b> and low outer-directedness. This {{was the basis}} of the locus-of-control scale proposed by Rotter in 1966, although it was based on Rotter's belief that locus of control is a single construct. Since 1970, Rotter's assumption of uni-dimensionality has been challenged, with Levenson (for example) arguing that different dimensions of locus of control (such as beliefs that events in one's life are self-determined, or organized by powerful others and are chance-based) must be separated. Weiner's early work in the 1970s suggested that orthogonal to the internality-externality dimension, differences should be considered between those who attribute to stable and those who attribute to unstable causes.|$|E

Whereas numerous researchers have found that substance use is predictive of graduation from high 3 chool, others have found that poor academic achievement and low academic aspirations have a significant influence on substance use onset.

Adolescents (N= 464), ages 12 - 16, from grades 6 through 11, and their parent(s) completed parallel questionnaires measuring marijuana, cigarette, and alcohol use; achievement motivation; and academic achievement.

2500|$|Rotter (1975) {{cautioned that}} internality and {{externality}} represent two {{ends of a}} continuum, not an either/or typology. Internals tend to attribute outcomes of events to their own control. People who have {{internal locus of control}} believe that the outcomes of their actions are results of their own abilities. Internals believe that their hard work would lead them to obtain positive outcomes. They also believe that every action has its consequence, which makes them accept the fact that things happen and it depends on them if they want to have control over it or not. Externals attribute outcomes of events to external circumstances. People with an external locus of control tend to believe that the things which happen in their lives are out of their control, and even that their own actions are a result of external factors, such as fate, luck, the influence of powerful others (such as doctors, the police, or government officials) and/or a belief that the world is too complex for one to predict or successfully control its outcomes. Such people tend to blame others rather than themselves for their lives' outcomes. It should not be thought, however, that internality is linked exclusively with attribution to effort and externality with attribution to luck (as Weiner's work – see below – [...] makes clear). This has obvious implications for differences between internals and externals in terms of their <b>achievement</b> <b>motivation,</b> suggesting that internal locus is linked with higher levels of need for achievement. Due to their locating control outside themselves, externals tend to feel they have less control over their fate. People with an external locus of control tend to be more stressed and prone to clinical depression.|$|E

40|$|Nationwide, {{increased}} accountability measures require educational {{leaders to}} develop and implement instructional practices that expedite the narrowing of the achievement gap. Legislation in several states allows states to annex low-performing schools. With such pressure, school districts are looking to educational consultants to facilitate the transformation of reading instruction, thereby raising levels of academic achievement. A thorough vetting of these interventions, however, is necessary to determine if the potential benefits can be generalized to other populations. The purpose of this quantitative, causal-comparative study was to compare the reading <b>achievement</b> and reading <b>motivation</b> of two groups of African American males in an alternative high school. One group (n = 140) was enrolled in READ 180, while their peers (n = 141) were enrolled in culturally relevant literature classes. Scholastic Reading Inventory scores were used to compare changes in reading achievement. Scholastic Independent Reader surveys were used to compare changes in reading motivation between the two groups over the course of one academic year. A repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to test the hypotheses. The two independent variables were (a) class with two levels (READ 180 and culturally relevant literature class), and (b) time with two levels (pre-intervention and post-intervention). The MANOVA assessed the effect of the independent variables on the linear combination of the dependent variables (<b>achievement</b> and <b>motivation).</b> Significant main effects and interactions were investigated. Students in READ 180 exhibited statistically significant growth in reading <b>achievement</b> and <b>motivation.</b> Similarly, students in culturally relevant literature classes vii also exhibited statistically significant growth in both reading <b>achievement</b> and <b>motivation.</b> While the changes in reading <b>achievement</b> and <b>motivation</b> were slightly higher for students who participated in culturally relevant literature classes, these differences were not statistically significant. The differences between groups at posttest were largely reflective of the differences that existed at pretest; it seems that differences between groups are more likely attributed to differences in the composition of the groups, rather than differences in the type of reading program.

30|$|Concerning the {{association}} between students’ <b>motivation,</b> <b>achievement,</b> parental education, educational aspiration and gender, {{the results indicate that}} the <b>achievement</b> levels and <b>motivation</b> factors such as parental involvement differ across these countries. Whereas the relationship between parental involvement and the other constructs were cultural specific the relationship between like mathematics, value mathematics, confidence in mathematics, and teacher responsiveness were universal. Moreover, parental education, gender and long-term educational aspiration also influence the students’ <b>achievement</b> and <b>motivation.</b> As with previous studies (e.g., Gil-Flores et al. 2011), higher educational aspirations and higher parental education were associated with higher achievement. Moreover, the study found that parental education and students’ aspirations were more associated with students’ <b>achievement</b> than students’ <b>motivation</b> (cf. Marks et al. 2001; Schoon and Parson 2002; Schoon et al. 2004). These findings contradict studies that indicate that self-concept (i.e., mathematics confidence) is the strongest motivational predictor of students’ achievement (e.g., Marsh et al. 2008; Marks et al. 2001). The strongest association was between teacher responsiveness and students’ self-beliefs. Interestingly, Ghana was the only nation where boys reported higher educational aspirations than girls as well as showing higher motivation levels for all the constructs. Even so achievement levels in Ghana were the lowest of all the countries.|$|R
