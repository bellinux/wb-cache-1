5|$|Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and {{the game}} ends {{immediately}} if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. In any given scene, the game provides no clues {{as to what the}} player should do next, features no HUD except for an oxygen bar during the swimming sequences, and no on-screen text; and the characters the player meets speak in unintelligible <b>alien</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike many of {{the sets}} {{featured}} on the show which were filmed on a Fox soundstage, the shot of the buried alien space craft was actually filmed in the hills near Simi Valley, California. Carter wanted a full-scale mock-up of the alien ship {{to be buried in}} the ground. This was unusual for the show; usually, {{a small portion of the}} ship would have been buried in the ground and the rest would have been filled in either via digital graphics, or with a scale model. In this episode, however, all of the shots of the alien ship, sans the take off, were done practically. To create the otherworldly glow of the ship, over 100 lamps were hidden within the craft. In addition, the ship itself was covered in glyphs that are supposed to be part of an unknown <b>alien</b> <b>language.</b> This was accomplished by designing fictional characters and programming them into a computer. These were then printed as letters which could be applied to the ship's hull.|$|E

25|$|Forced {{subtitles}} {{are common}} on movies and only provide subtitles when the characters speak a foreign or <b>alien</b> <b>language,</b> or a sign, flag, or other text {{in a scene}} is not translated in the localization and dubbing process.

25|$|The Foundation update {{also adds}} in two new play modes, with the {{original}} gameplay considered as the third, default mode. Survival mode is similar to standard gameplay but the difficulty is much higherâ€”atmospheric effects have larger impact on the exosuit's armour, alien creatures are more hostile, Sentinels are more alert and deadly, and resources tend to be sparse. If a player should die in Survival mode, they must restart {{without being able to}} recover their lost progress, though they still possess their credits, <b>alien</b> <b>language</b> progress, and known blueprints. Creative mode removes much of the mechanics that can kill the player's character, and gives them unlimited resources for constructing bases.|$|E

500|$|On {{a desolate}} planet, {{a team of}} 12 Xeno project {{scientists}} are conducting an archaeological excavation of the ruins of an ancient civilisation. Shortly after an underground tomb network is found to contain crystals and wall inscriptions, photographer Dean White (Dominic Jephcott) is engulfed in a rock blast and left incapacitated. Deciphering the <b>alien</b> <b>language</b> in the caves, xenolinguist Mitch (Trevor Thomas) theorises that the civilisation {{was built on the}} concept of dualism: the planet orbits a binary star, and a pair of twins seems to have ruled the race that once inhabited it. Medical assistant Sharon (Heather Wright) discovers that an energy field surrounds the crystals, which causes her to deduce that a [...] "chemical intelligence" [...] controlled life on the planet.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Reeve appears {{twice as}} Virgil Swann, a {{scientist}} {{who was able to}} translate the Kryptonian language. Swann first meets Clark in the season two episode [...] "Rosetta", where he explains his team of scientists intercepted a message from space and were able to translate it based on a mathematical key which accompanied the transmission. Swann informs Clark his birth name is Kal-El, and that he comes from a planet called Krypton, destroyed just after he was sent to Earth. When Lionel begins piecing together the <b>alien</b> <b>language</b> on the Kawatche cave walls, and Clark's constant presence at the caves, he seeks out Swann for the answers in the season three episode [...] "Legacy". Swann, though he denies knowing how to read the symbols in the caves, agrees to help Lionel when he correctly guesses Lionel is dying; how Swann helps Lionel is not made clear. In season four's [...] "Sacred", it is revealed Swann died, but not before sending Clark the octagonal disk from Clark's ship, which had been missing since season three's [...] "Legacy".|$|E

500|$|Joel Goldsmith and Richard Band, {{the brother}} of film {{producer}} Charles Band, composed the music for Laserblast, marking the first film score for both composers. The score was written in five days, and makes heavy use of synthesizer, particularly synthesized brass instruments, as well as electronic music. The music was also used in the Charles Band-produced film Auditions, released the same year, the 1986 science fiction film Robot Holocaust and the 1983 horror film The House on Sorority Row. [...] The company Echo Film Services handled the sound effects. The <b>alien</b> <b>language</b> chatter between the aliens in Laserblast was later used as sound effects in the metal band Static-X's song [...] "A Dios Alma Perdida", which is featured in their 2001 album Machine. During several points in the film when something explodes after it is shot by the laser gun, the scene is edited so that multiple shots of the same explosion are shown in succession. [...] This type of editing became a trademark of Charles Band's films, and was done previously in his 1977 films Crash! and End of the World.|$|E
500|$|While {{the events}} at the SGC repeat themselves, Daniel makes first {{progress}} in the translation of writings in the photos of the ancient altar. SG-1 return to the planet where Malikai lets slip he too remembers what's happening, but O'Neill finds himself back at breakfast before the altar's activation can be stopped. With the help of O'Neill's and Teal'c's explanations, Carter devises a plan to break the time loop by preventing an incoming wormhole, which fails. Meanwhile, Daniel attempts to translate the altar's writing loop after loop, but his memory is reset each time along with everyone else's, and he cannot possibly translate it all within just a few hours. [...] Ultimately, O'Neill and Teal'c realize the only solution is to learn and remember the <b>alien</b> <b>language</b> themselves. After many loops of teaching, Daniel makes an offhand remark about events that occur during each loop having no consequences once the loop is over, which inspires O'Neill and Teal'c to indulge in wildly outrageous behavior {{as a means of}} dealing with the boredom and frustration of being caught in repeating time. The pair play golf through the active Stargate (much to General Hammond's irritation in at least one loop), Teal'c takes action against the painful starts of his loops by slamming the door back {{in the face of the}} airman who accidentally hit him with it in the beginning of each loop, O'Neill tries pottery-making (clearly improving with each progressive loop), bicycles through the base, and just before the end of one loop, resigns from the Air Force whilst wearing an outrageous sweatshirt for the sole purpose of grabbing Carter and kissing her in the seconds before the loop resets.|$|E

2500|$|Louise {{returns to}} the camp as it is being evacuated, and tells Ian that the <b>alien</b> <b>language</b> is the [...] "weapon"; those who master it are able to {{perceive}} the future and past. She has a premonition of a United Nations event, in which Shang thanks her for having convinced him to call off the attack by calling his private number and reciting his wife's dying words. In the present, Louise steals a satellite phone, calls the number, and recites the words. The Chinese announce they are standing down and release their twelfth of the message. The other countries follow suit, and the craft disappear.|$|E
2500|$|The film uses {{a script}} {{designed}} by the artist Martine Bertrand (wife of the production designer Patrice Vermette), based on the scriptwriter's original concept. Computer scientists Stephen and Christopher Wolfram analysed it to {{provide the basis for}} Louise's work in the film. Three linguists from McGill University were consulted. The sound files for the <b>alien</b> <b>language</b> were created with consultation from Morgan Sonderegger, a phonetics expert. Lisa Travis was consulted for set design during the construction of the protagonist's workplaces. Jessica Coon, a Canada Research Chairin Syntax and Indigenous Languages, was consulted for her linguistics expertise during review of the script. Heisserer said at the Alamo Drafthouse's Fantastic Fest premiere at the end of September 2016 that Shang's wife's last words, translated into English, were [...] "In war, there are no winners, only widows". Villeneuve decided not to include subtitles for the line; Heisserer said he would have preferred it not be kept secret, and was happy to reveal the translation.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{interior}} and exterior locations used to suit {{the needs of the}} story, were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Within a 5-month shooting schedule, 3 weeks were spent shooting at studio locations. Production designer Jack Collis, explained how the film integrates a minority group (the aliens) into the film saying, [...] "The idea was to bring in this alien group, assimilate them into our society, and get them a locale that would be a part of Los Angeles, ... It would look almost as if a group of Koreans or Vietnamese that had moved into the area. This group would have established their own community. They have their own language, their own signs." [...] The film crew installed fictional <b>alien</b> <b>language</b> signs along Western Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard. Colored drawings were made of all stores {{on both sides of the}} street for two full blocks. Painted and electrical signs were designed for each building. Graffiti was also carefully planned out. The film crew did their own painting and even took a big blank concrete wall and inserted alien graffiti for a scene involving an early physical confrontation between the main characters. Essentially, the alphabet of the alien citizens had to be designed as an integral part of their environment. He commented how the crew [...] "came up with individual alphabets and then combined them into certain words like, say, 'enter' and 'open', so that we could repeat them, ..." [...] while also mentioning how they [...] "brought in a language expert to give us something the actors could be comfortable with." [...] The Hawthorns, a well known family of sign painters, created most of the alien signs. Collis even mused how at one point, store owners liked, and wouldn't want to take down the alien graffiti used during filming on their properties. Collis recalled how the <b>alien</b> <b>language</b> resembled [...] "a flowing design more like hand writing than lettering, that looks almost like a heartbeat graph. Occasionally, we'd underline it as though it came from sort of electronic machine, like an IBM report. It turned out to be such a simple thing once we got it going, but we had to go through a process of 'what is this going to look like?' before we got what we wanted." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Reader abounds with {{references}} to representations of the Holocaust, both external and internal to Michael's narrative, some real and some invented by Schlink. Of the latter, {{the most important is}} the book by the death-march survivor that constitutes the basis of the case against Hanna. It is summarized at some length and even briefly quoted, although its title is never given. Michael must read it in English since its German translation has not yet been published: [...] "(It was) an unfamiliar and laborious exercise at the time. And as always, the <b>alien</b> <b>language,</b> unmastered and struggled over, created a strange concatenation of distance and immediacy." [...] On a second reading in later life, he says, [...] "it is the book that creates distance." [...] For Michael, written media alone cannot convey a full impression of the Holocaust: the victims are not sympathetic, and the oppressors are too faceless to be judged. He cannot muster up the empathy to [...] "make the experience part of his internal life," [...] according to Froma Zeitlin. Hanna, however, has the opposite experience upon reading books by Holocaust survivors. She tells Michael: ...|$|E

60|$|New York {{became a}} changed city to Philip. Its roar and its turmoil, its babel of tongues {{speaking}} to him always in some <b>alien</b> <b>language,</b> were suddenly hushed! He was no longer conscious of the hard unconcern of a million faces, of the crude buildings in the streets, the cutting winds, the curious, depressing sense of being on a desert island, the hermit clutching at the sleeves of imaginary multitudes. A few minutes' journey in a cable car which seemed to crawl, a few minutes' swift walking along the broad thoroughfare of Fifth Avenue, where his feet seemed to fall upon {{the air and the}} passersby seemed to smile upon him like real human beings, and he was in her room. It was only an hotel sitting room, after all, but eloquent of her, a sitting room filled with great bowls of roses, with comfortable easy-chairs, furniture of rose-coloured satin, white walls, and an English fire upon the grate. Elizabeth was in New York, and the world moved differently.|$|E
50|$|Uhura has {{a smaller}} {{role in the}} first, second and third films.
