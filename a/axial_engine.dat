50|$|After {{the war he}} {{designed}} more motor-cycle engines, including an <b>axial</b> <b>engine,</b> and large 1,000 and 2,000 hp axial aircraft engines. A 3-cylinder Redrup 1948 Radial Motorcycle is preserved in the Sammy Miller Museum. The motorcycle uses a smaller 250 cc version of his radial engine mounted horizontally in a Royal Enfield motorcycle frame, and was assembled by him and his son.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} refined of the designs was the British Wooler wobble-plate engine of 1947. This 6-cylinder engine was {{designed}} by John Wooler, better known as a motorcycle engine designer, for aircraft use. It {{was similar to the}} Bristol <b>axial</b> <b>engine</b> but had two wobble-plates, driven by 12 opposed pistons in 6 cylinders. The engine is often incorrectly referred to as a swashplate engine. A single example is preserved in the Aeroplane Gallery of the Science Museum, London.|$|E
50|$|Charles Benjamin Redrup (1878-1961) was a British {{aeronautical}} engineer and inventor, who designed several innovative <b>axial</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Axial</b> <b>engines</b> (sometimes {{known as}} barrel or Z-crank engines) are {{a type of}} {{reciprocating}} engine with pistons arranged around an output shaft with their axes parallel to the shaft. Barrel refers to the cylindrical shape of the cylinder group (result of the pistons being spaced evenly around the central crankshaft and aligned parallel to the crankshaft axis) whilst the Z-crank alludes {{to the shape of}} the crankshaft.|$|R

50|$|On {{his return}} to Canada in 1944, the NRC sent Boyd to Turbo Research. The team {{initially}} had to decide between the centrifugal or <b>axial</b> <b>engine</b> designs, and Boyd outlined designs based on both, the TR.1 being the centrifugal version, and the TR.2 and TR.3 being two variations of the axial design. The team eventually decided to move directly to the more promising axial design, and started real work on the TR.3 in 1945. Boyd split off to start work on a smaller design, the TR.4, which was later named the Chinook. Work on the TR.3 was later abandoned.|$|E
50|$|During the 1840s, Page {{developed}} what {{he termed}} the <b>Axial</b> <b>Engine.</b> This instrument used an electromagnetic solenoid coil to draw an iron rod into its hollow interior. The rod's displacement opened a switch that stopped current from flowing in the coil; then being unattracted, the rod reverted out of the coil, and this cycle repeated again. The resulting reciprocating motion of the rod back and forth, {{into and out of}} the coil, was converted to rotary motion by the mechanism. After demonstrating uses of this engine to run saws and pumps, Page successfully petitioned the U.S. Senate for funds to produce an electromagnetic locomotive, based on this design.|$|E
50|$|The Bristol <b>Axial</b> <b>Engine</b> of the mid-1930s was {{designed}} by Charles Benjamin Redrup for the Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company; it was a 7-litre, 9-cylinder, wobble-plate type engine. It was originally conceived as a power unit for buses, possibly because its compact format would {{allow it to be}} installed beneath the vehicle's floor. The engine had a single rotary valve to control induction and exhaust. Several variants were used in Bristol buses during the late 1930s, the engine going through several versions from RR1 to RR4, which had a power output of 145 hp at 2900 rpm. Development was halted in 1936 following a change of management at the Bristol company.|$|E
5000|$|... == Swashplate and {{wobble plate}} engines == The only {{internal}} combustion cam engines {{that have been}} remotely successful were the swashplate engines. These were almost all <b>axial</b> <b>engines,</b> where the cylinders are arranged parallel to the engine axis, {{in one or two}} rings. The purpose of such engines was usually to achieve this axial or [...] "barrel" [...] layout, making an engine with a very compact frontal area. There were plans at one time to use barrel engines as aircraft engines, with their reduced frontal area allowing a smaller fuselage and lower drag.|$|R
5000|$|Redrup {{carried out}} most of his {{development}} work in a simply-equipped home workshop, and often said that he made most of his engines {{with little more than}} [...] "a knife and fork". He was the inventor of [...] "Wobble-Plate" [...] <b>axial</b> <b>engines,</b> which powered a motor launch and a Crossley Motors car in the 1920s. A variant of the engine also flew in a Simmonds Spartan aircraft in 1929, and was exhibited at the Olympia Air Show in July of that year. He also designed radial engines for Avro in the 1920s.|$|R

50|$|As {{a result}} of his engine shown at the Olympia Air Show, he was engaged by the Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company to design an engine for them, and moved to Bristol where he {{designed}} the Bristol <b>Axial</b> <b>Engine.</b> It was a 7-litre, 9 cylinder, wobble-plate type engine.

5000|$|An {{alternate}} design, the Rand cam engine, {{replaces the}} plate {{with one or more}} sinousoidal cam surfaces. Vanes mounted parallel to a shaft mounted inside a cylindrical 'barrel' that are free to sliding up and down ride the sinuous cam, the segments formed by rotor, stator walls and vanes constituting combustion chambers. In effect these spaces serving the same purpose as the cylinders of an <b>axial</b> <b>engine,</b> and the sinuous cam surface acts as the face of the pistons. In other respect this form follows the normal cycles of internal combustion but with burning gas directly imparting a force on the cam surface, translated into a rotational force by timing one or more detonations. This design eliminates the multiple reciprocal pistons, ball joints and swash plate of a conventional 'barrel' engine but crucially depends on effective sealing provided by sliding and rotating surfaces.http://www.regtech.com/radmax_technology/ ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1940, for a [...] "military load" [...] of 1500 lb, the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) {{had advised}} that {{work on an}} {{aircraft}} of 8500 lb all-up weight, with a total static thrust of 3,200 lb (14.2 kN) should be started, with an 11,000 lb (4,990 kg) design for the expected, more powerful, W.2 and <b>axial</b> <b>engine</b> designs. George Carter's calculations based on the RAE work and his own investigations was that a 8700 - 9000 lb aircraft with two or four 20 mm cannons and six 0.303 machine guns would have {{a top speed of}} 400-431 mph at sea level and 450-470 mph at 30,000 ft.

5000|$|While <b>axial</b> <b>engines</b> are {{challenging}} to make practicable at typical engine operating speeds some cam engines {{have been tested}} that offer extremely compact size (approximating to a six-inch (150mm) cube) yet producing approximately forty horsepower at c 7000 rpm, useful for light aerial applications. The attraction of lightweight and mechanically simple (far fewer major moving parts, {{in the form of}} a rotor plus twelve axial vanes forming twenty-four combustion chambers) engines, even with a finite working life, have obvious application for small unmanned aircraft. (Such a design having allegedly been tested at NAVAIR PSEF in 2003.) ...|$|R
50|$|Key to the engine's {{working cycle}} was an axial {{compressor}} of then-unique construction. Most German engines {{of the era}} had the stators {{do all of the}} actual compression, with the rotors speeding up the air for them to compress. In the HeS 30, the rotor and stators shared compression about 50-50, a design originally provided by Rudolph Friedrich of Junkers. Overall the engine had a five-stage compressor providing air at a compression ratio of 3:1 to ten flame cans, which powered a single-stage turbine. The turbine was also unique for the era, using a set of guide vanes that were adjustable for various operating speeds. Like most German <b>axial</b> <b>engines,</b> the engine also included a variable-geometry exhaust cone to lower back pressure when starting, but used an electric starter motor instead of the Riedel two-stroke, opposed-twin piston engine built into the BMW 003, Jumo 004 and the later HeS 011 engine designs for startup needs.|$|R

50|$|The last {{entry in}} the class is the UGST heavy {{deepwater}} torpedo {{with a range of}} up to 60 km (export versions are limited to 40 km). It differs from the most previous Soviet and Russian torpedoes in that unlike the previously dominant electric or peroxide propulsion, it uses the Otto fuel <b>axial</b> <b>engine,</b> which allows it to have much extended range while keeping the speeds of up to 65 knots. It also features an updated homing system, which, in addition to the traditional passive wake homing, features a phased array active sonar and an improved wire guidance system: previous Soviet torpedoes had the guidance wire spool in the torpedo body, with the wire released through the hollow propeller shaft, which had the disadvantage of the wire being prone to breakage, while the UGST has the wire release port on the side. Together with the towed extender spool, kept in the calmer portion of the wake, this makes the wire much more durable than before. It was supposed to enter service in the 1990s, but the teething problems and the lack of funding during that period made the deployment sluggish, and it entered the widespread service only in the 2015 by the Fizik name, being quickly replaced by the new-generation Futlyar (Fizik-2). Sources refer to them as heat-seeking torpedoes.|$|E
50|$|With {{these funds}} plus {{personal}} resources {{that took him}} into debt, Page built and tested the first full-sized electromagnetic locomotive, preceded only by the 1842 battery-powered model-sized Galvani of Scottish inventor Robert Davidson. Along the way, Page constructed a series of motors, revisions of the <b>axial</b> <b>engine</b> having different dimensions and mechanical features, which he tested thoroughly. The motor operated on large electrochemical cells, acid batteries having as electrodes zinc and costly platinum, with fragile clay diaphragms between the cells. Page's 1850 American Association for the Advancement of Science presentation about his progress impressed Joseph Henry, Benjamin Silliman and other leading scientists. On April 29, 1851, Page boosts its motors from 8 to 20 HP power. With two engines, he drives a 10-ton locomotive with {{a top speed of}} 30 km/h. He travels the route from Washington to Bladenburg in 19 minutes. Page conducted a full test, intending to run the 21,000 pound locomotive from Washington DC to Baltimore and back with passengers on board. Problems immediately arose. High voltage sparks, resulting from the very effect Page had investigated with the spiral conductor, broke through the electrical insulation of the electrical coils, resulting in short circuits. Many of the battery's fragile clay dividers cracked on starting up; others broke down subsequently. Page and his mechanic Ari Davis struggled to make repairs and keep the locomotive running. With some periods of steady running, the silent engine (by comparison to a steam locomotive) traveled 5 miles to Bladensburg, Maryland, attaining a top speed of 19 miles per hour. Page prudently reversed direction there, for what was an arduous, calamity-laced return to the National Capitol.|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the assessment of}} the effect of engine installation parameters such as engine position, size and power setting on the performance of a typical 300 seater aircraft at cruise condition. Two engines with very-high by-pass ratio and with different fan diameters and specific thrusts are initially simulated in isolation to determine the thrust and drag forces for an isolated configuration. The two engines are then assessed in an engine-airframe configuration to determine the sensitivity of the overall installation penalty to the vertical and <b>axial</b> <b>engine</b> location. The breakdown of the interference force is investigated to determine the aerodynamic origins of beneficial or penalising forces. To complete the cruise study a range of engine power settings were considered to determine the installation penalty at different phases of cruise. This work concludes with the preliminary assessment of cruise fuel burn for two engines. For the baseline engine, across the range of installed positions the resultant thrust requirement varied by 1. 7 % of standard net thrust. The larger engine was less sensitive with a variation of 1. 3 %. For an assessment over a 10000 km cruise flight the overall effect of the lower specific thrust engine showed that the cycle benefits of – 5. 8 % in specific fuel consumption was supplemented by a relatively beneficial aerodynamic installation effect but offset by the additional weight to give a - 4. 8 % fuel burn reduction...|$|E

50|$|Most {{revolving}} cylinder, <b>axial</b> piston <b>engine</b> designs utilize a fixed, multi-lobed barrel-type cam and rollers on the pistons {{to control}} the reciprocating movement of the pistons. The benefit of this approach, versus a conventional crankshaft-and-connecting-rod mechanism, is that the kinematics of the piston motion can be optimized with regards to combustion cycle efficiency.|$|R

50|$|The primary {{drawback}} to the revolving cylinder, <b>axial</b> piston <b>engine</b> design is that rotating piston assemblies {{are subjected to}} centrifugal forces, which can result in significant friction losses. These centrifugal forces increase at {{the square of the}} angular velocity. So unless the engine is run at very low rotational speeds, the friction losses due to centrifugal forces acting on the piston assemblies can quickly become unacceptable.|$|R
5000|$|In 1911 the Macomber Rotary Engine Company of Los Angeles marketed one of {{the first}} <b>axial</b> internal-combustion <b>engines,</b> {{manufactured}} by the Avis Engine Company of Allston, Massachusetts. A four-stroke, air-cooled unit, it had seven cylinders and a variable compression ratio, altered by changing the wobble-plate angle and hence the length of piston stroke. It was called a [...] "rotary engine", because the entire engine rotated apart from the end casings.|$|R
50|$|The primary claimed {{benefit of}} the {{revolving}} cylinder, <b>axial</b> piston <b>engine</b> is that a four-cycle, reciprocating piston engine can be achieved {{without the need for}} a complex and expensive valve train. The intake and exhaust flows are controlled by simple ports in the cylinder heads. Costs are further reduced because all cylinders {{at each end of the}} engine share a common fuel injector and/or spark plug. Additionally, the designs are typically compact and lightweight.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{elevated}} chamber pressure on combustion efficiency and heat transfer {{has been determined}} at the 100 lbf (445 N) thrust level for nitrogen tetroxide propellants. Measurements were made up to 500 psia (3. 45 MPa) with testbed hardware; tests at 100 psia (0. 690 MPa) and 250 psia (1. 72 MPa) were made with radiation-cooled rhenium chambers. The first task of the program served to determine desirable thruster applications and operating conditions: high total impulse, i. e. communication satellite or spacecraft bus <b>axial</b> <b>engines,</b> at chamber pressures up to 250 psia (1. 72 MPa) pressure-fed, or up to 500 psia (3. 45 MPa) pump-fed. The hardware modifications and testing required to obtain the data were determined in Task 2, which included design-support hot fire tests; supplemental hardware, including a 250 psia (1. 72 MPa) Pc rhenium chamber and a 20 % fuel-film cooled platelet injector was fabricated in Task 3. Testing showed that satisfactory operation of Ir-Re radiation chambers is assured at pressures up to 250 psia and may be possible up to 500. The heat transfer data obtained show good correlation with throat Reynolds number and are generally under values given by the simplified Bartz equation; chambers equilibrium temperatures match predicted values. Preliminary optimization of trip configuration and mixture ratio were made; Isp performance from thrust measurements was within 1 % of predicted values. Stability, compatibility, and front-end thermal management were determined to be satisfactory...|$|R
