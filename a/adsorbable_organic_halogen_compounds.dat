However, recent studies indicate compromising results since <b>adsorbable</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> increase rather than decrease due to the presence of high concentrations of halogen ions during the oxidation reactions. This might jeopardize the applicability of this innovative technique in the industry. Lab scale experiments with aqueous solutions containing either phenol or hexanol and 1000 mg L- 1 of chloride indeed show that AOX concentrations can increase until 300 µg Cl- L- 1 during chemical oxidation. Maximum concentrations depend greatly on the pH, chloride concentration, type of oxidant and oxidant dosage.

40|$|Materials {{of steam}} water cycles can suffer from {{corrosion}} induced by halide anions in feedwater. <b>Organic</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>compounds</b> in feedwater can be degraded and release halide anions under high temperature and pressure. Therefore {{it is necessary}} to be able to measure the <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> concentration. Existing measurements including <b>Adsorbable</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>Halogens</b> and Gas Chromatography are either not convenient, affordable, accurate or reproducible enough at these very low concentrations, meaning a new method should be developed. In this research the option of destroying the organic compounds to release the halide anions and measure them with ion chromatography was studied. The question is, which {{is the best way to}} destroy the organic compounds and release the halides anions. Six <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> model <b>compounds</b> were tested: aliphatic and aromatic fluorine, chlorine and bromine containing compounds. Two main methods were studied: UV/vacuumUV (VUV) photolysis and wet chemical oxidation with K 2 S 2 O 8. There are three phases in the research: 1. Study different UV lamps and oxidants on the target compounds and find the optimal combinations. 2. Try different dosages of K 2 S 2 O 8 and find an optimum. 3. Test halide release of target compounds in power plant conditions. In the experiments, three kinds of lamps were applied: VUV, low pressure (LP) lamp and medium pressure (MP) lamp. H 2 O 2 and TiO 2 were used as a catalyst. Last but not least, wet chemical oxidation was tested, with varying dosages of K 2 S 2 O 8. The experiments were executed with both single compounds and mixed compounds. The results show that the organic fluorine is the hardest to degrade while organic bromine is the easiest. Aromatic compounds are easier to degrade than aliphatic compounds. This happens not only in AOP process, but also in power plant conditions. The recovery of bromide and chloride in most methods could reach 95 % while aliphatic fluorine could only reach at most 70 %. It can be concluded that MP/H 2 O 2 is the most effective method for degradation of <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>compounds</b> since it requires less time for the reaction to be completed, but wet chemical oxidation also showed high recoveries for all halide anions. The advantage of wet chemical oxidation is simple equipment and universality. The method with the lowest degradation rate and recovery is UV/TiO 2.

Electrical conductivity (EC) of leachate may be used as a time and cost saving alternative to monitor sudden changes in concentration of these two parameters, due to high correlations of around 0. 8 with both COD and NH 4 -N values which are possibly due to low heavy metal concentrations in leachate. The decreased concentrations of heavy metals and BOD 5 favor the retrofitting of an existing biological reactor (nitrification/denitrification) with the deammonification process and post denitrification, as this lowers average annual operational cost (in terms of energy and external carbon source) and CO 2 emission by € 25, 850 and 15, 855 kg CO 2,eq respectively...|$|R

The present study is aimed to appraise the antioxidant potential and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis in Ananus comosus peel. The enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants profiles were analyzed in fresh peel of pineapple with the standard protocols and the FTIR was applied and Infrared spectrum in mid infrared region 4000 – 400 cm– 1 was used for discriminating and to identify various functional groups present in the ethanolic extract of Ananus comosus. The fresh peel shows the significant amount of antioxidants and the FTIR analysis also found the presence of amino acids, alkenes, nitrates, nitrites, ethers, esters, aldehydes, alkynes, aromatic <b>compounds,</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>compounds,</b> carbohydrates, sulphur derivatives and polysaccharides. In conclusion, the results presented in the peel of Ananus comosus have strong antioxidant content which may be act as good pharmacotherapeutic agents in future...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} communication, {{it was shown}} by Pillemer, Ecker and Wells (1) that keratins are species specific, and that their specificity depends on the redox state of the sulfhydryl groupings in their molecule. Since keratins contain {{a high percentage of}} disulfide sulfur (10 to 15 per cent cystine) and are readily reduced to sulfhydryl proteins by alkaline thioglycolate, a large number of substituent groups may be introduced into their molecules by reaction with simple <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>compounds</b> according to the following formula (2) : A [...] SH + R [...] X-' ~ A [...] S [...] R + HX The present report presents evidence showing that substitution of the SH group of kerateines by simple chemical compounds influences the serologic behavior as well as the chemical characteristics of the derived proteins.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{effectiveness}} of dehalogenation of <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>compounds,</b> a series of silver-modified Cu foam electrodes (Ag/Cu foam electrode) was prepared via chemical deposition, using AgNO 3 as the precursor. The crystal structure and morphology of the electrodes were measured by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that zero-valence Ag particles dispersed finely on the Cu foam surface and their number increased with Ag loading. Electrocatalytic activity was evaluated by monitoring the debromination of mono-bromoacetic acid (MBAA). The best operational conditions were a silver loading of 2 mg/cm 2, applied current density of 5. 5 mA/cm 2, and pH 7. 0. After five successive cycles, the Ag/Cu electrode remained stable for the electrocatalytic debromination of MBAA. We suggest that the improved electrocatalytic activity of the Ag/Cu electrode is mainly attributable to a strong interaction between MBAA and the Ag particles {{on the surface of}} electrode. These findings might be of great significance for improving the electrochemical dehalogenation process...|$|R
40|$|Xylanase {{production}} from a Bacillus subtilis gene cloned into {{a strain of}} Escherichia coli was measured. Although this gene was expressed in E. coli at several temperatures, efficient normal xylanase secretion did not occur, the observed protein release apparently depending on cell leakage or lysis. Screening for a better microbial protein secretor free of cellulase selected B. cereus # 259. The strain had wild plasmids that were hard to eliminate using acridine orange and elevated temperature curing techniques. While still bearing 5 wild plasmids, attempts to transform B. cereus # 259 were unsuccessful using conventional methods and electroporation. Another strain, B. cereus # 518, found {{to be free of}} wild plasmids, was then used. A bidirectional vector shuttle plasmid (pMK 3) was employed to carry the cloned gene into this B. cereus strain. Transformation was carried out by high voltage electroporation. Xylanase production by the new B. cereus clone was similar to that from E. coli, but was shown to be continuously and normally secreted. The xylanase gene products from the E. coli and B. cereus hosts were shown to function identically. Both xylanases improved the delignification of unbleached softwood and hardwood kraft pulps, thus reducing the Cl$ sb 2 $ required to achieve a given degree of bleaching, without altering the physical properties of the fibers. Using a target kappa number lignin content) of 5, xylanase pretreatment of aspen kraft pulp led to a 22 % saving of chlorine. <b>Adsorbable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halogens</b> in the bleachery effluent were also lowered by more than 50 %...|$|R
25|$|In 1974 Frank Sherwood Rowland, Chemistry Professor at the University of California at Irvine, and his {{postdoctoral}} associate Mario J. Molina {{suggested that}} long-lived <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>compounds,</b> such as CFCs, might {{behave in a}} similar fashion as Crutzen had proposed for nitrous oxide. James Lovelock had recently discovered, during a cruise in the South Atlantic in 1971, that almost all of the CFC compounds manufactured since their invention in 1930 were still present in the atmosphere. Molina and Rowland concluded that, like , the CFCs would reach the stratosphere where they would be dissociated by UV light, releasing chlorine atoms. A year earlier, Richard Stolarski and Ralph Cicerone at the University of Michigan had shown that Cl is even more efficient than NO at catalyzing the destruction of ozone. Similar conclusions were reached by Michael McElroy and Steven Wofsy at Harvard University. Neither group, however, had realized that CFCs were a potentially large source of stratospheric chlorine—instead, they had been investigating the possible effects of HCl emissions from the Space Shuttle, which are very much smaller.|$|R
