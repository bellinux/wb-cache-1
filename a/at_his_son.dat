25|$|Cylinder A {{opens on}} {{a day in the}} distant past when destinies were {{determined}} with Enlil, the highest god in the Sumerian pantheon, in session with the Divine Council and looking with admiration <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Ningirsu (another name for Ninurta) and his city, Lagash.|$|E
25|$|By 1200 Saladin's brother Al-Adil {{succeeded in}} {{securing}} {{control over the}} whole empire by defeating and killing or imprisoning his brothers and nephews in turn. With each victory Al-Adil incorporated the defeated mamluk retinue into his own. This process was repeated at Al-Adil's death in 1218, and <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Al-Kamil's death in 1238. The Ayyubids became increasingly surrounded by the mamluks, who acted semi-autonomously as regional atabegs. The mamluks increasingly {{became involved in the}} internal court politics of the kingdom itself as various factions used them as allies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} summer of 951, before his father marched across the Alps, Otto's son Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, invaded Lombardy in {{northern}} Italy. The exact reasons for Liudolf's action are unclear, and historians have proposed several possible motivations. Liudolf may {{have tried to}} help Adelaide, a distant relative of Liudolf's wife Ida, or he intended to strengthen his position within the royal family. The young heir was also competing with his uncle, Duke Henry of Bavaria, both in German affairs and Northern Italy. While Liudolf was preparing his expedition, Henry influenced the Italian aristocrats not to join Liudolf's campaign. When Liudolf arrived in Lombardy, he found no support {{and was unable to}} sustain his troops. His army was near destruction until Otto's troops crossed the Alps. The king reluctantly received Liudolf's forces into his command, angry <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> for his independent actions.|$|E

[...] During his childhood, he accompanied his father to meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous. LaBeouf has also said he was subjected to verbal and mental abuse by his father, who once pointed a gun <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> during a Vietnam War flashback. LaBeouf has stated {{that his father was}} [...] "on drugs" [...] during his childhood, and was placed in drug rehabilitation for heroin addiction, while LaBeouf's mother was [...] "trying to hold down the fort." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1941, Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes hired Adams for {{six months}} to create {{photographs}} of lands {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Department of the Interior. Wright accompanied Adams and his young son Michael Adams on a long road trip around the west. While traveling through the Chama River valley near nightfall on November 1, 1941, they encountered a [...] "fantastic scene", a church and cemetery near Hernandez, New Mexico, and pulled to the side of the road. Adams recalled that he yelled <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Michael and at Wright to [...] "Get this! Get that, for God's sake! We don't have much time!" [...] Desperate to capture the image in the fading light, they scrambled to set up the tripod and camera, knowing that only moments remained before the light was gone. The result was Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico, a photograph that became so popular and collectible that Adams personally made over 1,300 photographic prints of it during his long career. [...] On October 17, 2006, Sotheby's auctioned a print of this photograph for $609,600. [...] Art historian H. W. Janson called this photo [...] "a perfect marriage of straight and pure photography".|$|E

2500|$|Although his mother, sisters, and few {{close friends}} {{themselves}} never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed. One of Gacy's friends at school recalled several {{instances in which}} Gacy Sr. ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, he witnessed an incident in which Gacy's father began shouting <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> for no reason, then began hitting him. Gacy's mother attempted to intervene between her son and her husband. The friend recalled Gacy simply [...] "put up his hands to defend himself", adding that he never struck his father back during these altercations.|$|E
2500|$|While the Lady Of The Lake laments {{her lack}} of stage time ("Whatever Happened To My Part?"), Sir Lancelot {{receives}} a letter from what he assumes is a young damsel in distress. He is very {{surprised to find that}} the [...] "damsel" [...] is actually an effeminate young man named Prince Herbert ("Where Are You?"/"Here Are You") whose overbearing, music-hating father, the King of Swamp Castle, is forcing him into an arranged marriage. As Herbert is asking Lancelot to help him escape, the King of Swamp Castle cuts the rope that he is using to climb out of the window, and Herbert falls to his apparent death. Lancelot is a bit puzzled at the king's actions, but it is revealed that Herbert was saved at the last minute by Lancelot's sidekick, Concorde. The King asks his son how he was saved, exactly, to which Herbert replies happily with a song. But the king charges <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> with a spear, preparing to kill him. Lancelot steps in to save him, then gives a tearful, heartfelt speech about sensitivity to the king on Herbert's behalf, and Lancelot is outed as a homosexual in the process, an announcement celebrated in a wild disco number ("His Name is Lancelot").|$|E

60|$|Mr. Meadowcroft the elder, having {{not spoken}} one word thus far, himself {{introduced}} the newcomer to me, with a side-glance <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons,</b> which had something like defiance in it--a glance which, as I {{was sorry to}} notice, was returned with the defiance on their side by the two young men.|$|R
