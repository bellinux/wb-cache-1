5|$|The Clemson Tigers {{began the}} 2009 season after {{finishing}} 7–6 in 2008, including a season-ending {{loss in the}} 2009 Gator Bowl to Nebraska. Heading into 2010, Clemson returned many of its 2009 players, but faced questions about whether those players would perform better with another year of experience. Also under question was head coach Dabo Swinney, who was beginning his first full season as {{head coach of the}} Tigers after assuming control in the seventh game of 2008. Clemson attempted to <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the questions about the team's potential in {{the first game of the}} season, a 37–14 win against Middle Tennessee State.|$|E

25|$|In 1927, Ranjitsinhji {{came under}} attack from the All India States Peoples Conference which accused him, among other things, of being an {{absentee}} ruler, high taxes and restricting liberties. He responded through supporting published works by different authors, including Jamnagar and its Ruler in 1927, Nawanagar and its Critics in 1929 and The Land of Ranji and Duleep in 1931. Although not entirely accurate, they attempted to <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the criticisms. Ranjitsinhji visited England in 1930, {{to take part in}} talks on India's constitution. While there, he was well received by former cricketers and saw Duleepsinhji score 174 against Australia in a Test match at Lord's. At the request of Sussex, he was president of the county for the year. He continued to oppose Indian federation, despite support for the idea from the British and some of the princes. He was chancellor to the Chamber of Princes in 1933, shortly before he died.|$|E

I learned what letters he wanted to see and which ones it was not necessary to show him ... I came to know exactly how Mr. Roosevelt would <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his letters, how he would couch his thoughts. When he discovered that I had learned these things it took a load off his shoulders, for instead of having to dictate the answers to many letters he could just say yes or no and I knew what to say and how to say it.|$|E

500|$|In 1962, {{scientists}} at Los Alamos created a mockup of Little Boy known as [...] "Project Ichiban" [...] {{in order to}} <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the unanswered questions, but it failed to clear up all the issues. In 1982, Los Alamos created a replica Little Boy from the original drawings and specifications. This was then tested with enriched uranium but in a safe configuration that would not cause a nuclear explosion. A hydraulic lift was used to move the projectile, and experiments were run to assess neutron emission. Based on this and the data from The Great Artiste, the yield was estimated at 16.6 ± 0.3 kilotons. After considering many estimation methods, a 1985 report concluded that the yield was 15 kilotons ± 20%.|$|E
500|$|The Stanley {{plan also}} {{established}} {{a committee to}} investigate race relations and integration in Virginia. [...] This committee was officially titled the Virginia Committee on Law Reform and Racial Activities, but was publicly known as the [...] "Thomson Committee" [...] after its chair, Delegate James McIlhany Thomson. In 1954, David Scull (a printer in Annandale, Virginia) began publishing pro-integration literature {{on behalf of a}} number of organizations in Virginia. The Fairfax Citizens' Council, a group opposed to desegregation, publicized Scull's role in the printing of the literature in 1957. Scull was subpoenaed to appear before the Thomson Committee, and subjected to an aggressive series of questions (many of which did not pertain to the committee's legal charge). Scull refused to <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these questions, and the committee went to court to force him to answer. A state circuit court ruled against Scull and ordered him to answer the questions. He refused, and was convicted of contempt of court.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly Dalton Ross {{named the}} episode {{as one of}} the season's best, commending the fact that [...] "most of the main {{questions}} were actually answered," [...] unlike the season finale of Lost. He praised the Bree storyline as well as the conclusion to the Mary Alice mystery, calling it [...] "both shocking and satisfying." [...] Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC also compared the episode to the Lost season finale, writing: [...] "'Desperate Housewives' is willing to <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its mysterious questions and give readers a little bit of closure. 'Lost,' heading into its own two-hour finale this Wednesday, is still dangling a dozen carrots in front of impatient viewers." [...] Cooper felt that the episode was a satisfying conclusion to the season opining that [...] "by allowing some of its plots to remain tantalizing mysteries, yet offering up the satisfaction of explaining others, 'Desperate Housewives' has smartly set things up for its audience to return for its new season next fall." [...] Frazier Moore of USA Today called the finale [...] "a smashing close" [...] to the first season. Moore expressed interest in how the cliffhangers would be resolved, {{as well as in the}} Betty Applewhite character. He also theorized that Rex's death was a ruse, writing: [...] "Reminder: The audience saw no death scene and no body. When has Desperate Housewives exercised restraint without an ulterior motive?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Some more {{cautious}} commentators said the show had promise {{but could not}} go on tantalizing the audience with a proliferation of mysteries. [...] "The effort required to follow the story", said Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter, [...] "goes well beyond what most viewers {{might be willing to}} give." [...] Ken Tucker of [...] Entertainment Weekly called the pilot [...] "an irritating tease" [...] and hoped the second episode would <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the questions the pilot asked.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding truth, Armstrong holds {{to what he}} {{describes}} as a [...] "Maximalist" [...] version of truthmaker theory: he believes that every truth has a truthmaker, although there doesn't necessarily exist a one-to-one mapping between truth and truthmaker. The possibility of one to many relations between truths and truthmakers is a feature that Armstrong believes allows truthmaker theory to <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the criticisms levelled at older correspondence theories of truth (of which he believes truthmaker theory to be an improved version). Negative truths have truthmakers in Armstrong's account: he gives the example of a wall that is painted green. The wall being painted green is a truth for the proposition that it is not painted white and the proposition that it is not painted red and so on.|$|E
