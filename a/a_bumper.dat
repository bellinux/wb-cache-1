Notable cut scenes include Jim and the others {{trying to get the}} truck into the warehouse door but getting the truck stuck instead, Dwight trying to use Kevin as <b>a</b> <b>bumper</b> on the oil track, and Phyllis, Toby, and Ryan revealing what they would do if they won the lottery.|$|E
5|$|Located on an embankment, {{the station}} has four tracks {{with only the}} two outer ones in revenue service. The two center express tracks have been {{disconnected}} from the line and have permanently been removed from service. North of this station, {{a portion of the}} southbound express track connects with the southbound local track at its north end, and ends at <b>a</b> <b>bumper</b> block at its southern end. This section of track can be used for revenue service or work train layups, but this use has been made completely redundant because of the nearby Pitkin Yard serving as the primary layup yard instead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{the city was}} {{considered}} as a site for the film The Squaw Man by Jesse Lasky and Cecil B. DeMille, but was abandoned in favor of Hollywood. Several recent movies have been filmed, at least in part, in Flagstaff. A small scene in Midnight Run was filmed in Flagstaff at the train depot, the city was also referenced in the film. Several of the running scenes in Forrest Gump were filmed {{in and around the}} area, including a memorable scene where Forrest is seen jogging in downtown Flagstaff and gives inspiration to <b>a</b> <b>bumper</b> sticker designer ("Shit happens"). Parts of 2007 Academy Award winner Little Miss Sunshine were filmed at the junction of I-40 and I-17 in Flagstaff, and Terminal Velocity was partially filmed in the city.|$|E

5|$|The cabbage tree's year {{begins in}} autumn among the tight spike of unopened leaves {{projecting}} from {{the centre of}} each tuft of leaves. Some of the growing tips have changed from making leaves to producing inflorescences for the coming spring, and around these, two or three buds begin to produce leaves. The inflorescence and the leaf buds pass the winter protected by the enveloping spike of unopened leaves. Months later in spring or early summer, it bears its flowers {{on the outside of}} the tree, exposed to insects and birds. Flowering takes place over a period of four to six weeks, giving maximum exposure to pollinating insects. The flowers produce a sweet perfume which attracts large numbers of insects. The nectar produced by the flowers contains aromatic compounds, mainly esters and terpenes, which are particularly attractive to moths. Bees use the nectar to produce a light honey to feed their young and increase the size of the hive in the early summer. It takes about two months for the fruit to ripen, and by the end of summer a cabbage tree can have thousands of small fruits available for birds to eat and disperse. The strong framework of the inflorescence can easily bear the weight of heavy birds like the New Zealand pigeon, which was formerly the major disperser of the seeds. Each fruit contains three to six shiny, black seeds which are coated in a charcoal-like substance called phytomelan. The latter may serve to protect the seeds from the digestive process in the gut of a bird. The seeds are also rich in linoleic acid as a food source for the developing embryo plant, a compound which is also important in the egg-laying cycle of birds. Because it takes about two years for a particular stem to produce an inflorescence, cabbage trees tend to flower heavily in alternative years, with <b>a</b> <b>bumper</b> flowering every three to five years. Each inflorescence bears 5,000 to 10,000 flowers, so a large inflorescence may carry about 40,000 seeds, or one million seeds for the whole tree in a good flowering year—hundreds of millions for a healthy grove of trees.|$|E

25|$|There are twelve main appellations of Beaujolais wines {{covering}} {{the production of}} more than 96 villages in the Beaujolais region. They were originally established in 1936, with additional crus being promoted in 1938 and 1946, plus Régnié in 1988. About half of all Beaujolais wine is sold under the basic Beaujolais AOC designation. The majority of this wine is produced in the southern Bas Beaujolais region located around the town of Belleville. The minimum natural alcohol level for the grapes is 10%, and the maximum yield is 60 hl/ha (65 hl/ha for <b>a</b> <b>bumper</b> crop) The wine may be labeled as Beaujolais Supérieur in case the minimum natural alcohol level for the grapes is 10,5%, and the maximum yield is 58 hl/ha (63 hl/ha for <b>a</b> <b>bumper</b> crop). Exactly the same limits are effective for Beaujolais-Villages. Maximum chaptalization levels are established at 3 g/l (glucose + fructose).|$|E

25|$|Delaware fruit growers had {{experienced}} <b>a</b> <b>bumper</b> year in 1875, and {{a glut of}} peaches on the local market had depressed the price correspondingly. Seeking {{to take advantage of}} the situation, the ASC's management placed advertisements offering to ship the surplus fruit to the United Kingdom in specially ventilated compartments on Ohio. The ASC organized a train to pick up the fruit, and the response was overwhelming, with over 4,500 baskets of peaches delivered. Ohio sailed for Liverpool with its cargo of peaches in late August.|$|E
25|$|North of this station, {{there is}} an unused trackway, {{splitting}} from the southbound local track for a proposed subway under Fourth Avenue (later built as the BMT Fourth Avenue Line).
