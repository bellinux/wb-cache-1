40|$|A {{method to}} {{simulate}} residual stress field of planetary gear is proposed. In this method, the {{finite element model}} of planetary gear is established and divided to tooth zone and profile zone, whose different temperature field is set. The gear's residual stress simulation is realized by the thermal compression stress generated by the temperature difference. Based on the simulation, the finite element model of planetary gear train is established, the dynamic meshing process is simulated, and influence of residual stress on equivalent stress of <b>addendum,</b> pitch <b>circle,</b> and dedendum of internal and external meshing planetary gear tooth profile is analyzed, according to non-linear contact theory, thermodynamic theory, and finite element theory. The {{results show that the}} equivalent stresses of planetary gear at both meshing and nonmeshing surface are significantly and differently reduced by residual stress.

(2004) {{determined}} the optimal die gap programming of {{extrusion blow molding}} processes that establish a back propagation network using a Taguchi’s experimental array to predict the relationship between design variables and responses. Lakshminarayanan and Balasubramanian (2008) applied the Taguchi approach and {{determined the}} optimal value of tensile strength of friction stir-welded RDE- 40 aluminum alloy as 303  MPa. Through the Taguchi parametric design approach, the optimum levels of parameters were determined {{and the results were}} confirmed by further experiments. Parameswara Rao and Sarcar (2009) studied the influence of optimal parameters of wire cut EDM on cutting speed, surface roughness, spark gap and material removal rate of brass workpiece. This study was useful in finding cutting time for any size of job and to set parameters namely discharge current, voltage at rated wire speed and tension, for required surface finish with high accuracy of cutting. Kim and Lee (2009) once again applied the Taguchi method to determine the hybrid welding conditions of aluminum alloy (AA 5052 -H 32). By employing Taguchi method, they determined the optimal process parameters associated with hybrid welding of aluminum alloy. Results of tensile testing corresponding to orthogonal array were used to compute signal-to-noise ratios for optimal combination of parameters. The most crucial hybrid welding parameter determined by ANOVA was the weld direction. Chen et al. (2009) identified that the critical to quality characteristic identified was the roundness of holes cut by a plasma machine. They conducted the design of experiments with a total of 36 experiments in which the optimal setting combination was identified as 93  in/min for feed rate, 100  V for voltage and 63  A for amperage. Prashantha et al. (2009) in their research found that the addition of 2  wt% of carbon nanotubes into polypropylene (PP) significantly reduced the shrinkage and warpage of injection-moulded parts up to 48 %. The method employed was the Taguchi approach to study the effects of process parameters on the warpage and shrinkage of injection-moulded parts. Kamaruddin et al. (2010) evaluated the performance of plastic (75 % polypropylene and 25 % low-density polyethylene LPDE) trays in terms of its shrinkage behavior. An orthogonal array (OA), main effect, signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are employed to analyze the effect of injection molding parameters on the shrinkage behavior of the product. The optimum total shrinkage is found to be 0.1521  cm. Using Taguchi method for design of experiment (DOE), other significant effects such as interaction among injection molding parameters are also investigated. Zaharudin et al. (2012) employed the Taguchi method for optimizing the manufacturing parameters of friction materials produced by powder metallurgy method. The key quality characteristics identified were hardness, specific gravity, and wear. Taguchi method was used for optimizing the manufacturing parameters, namely molding pressure, molding temperature and molding time, for friction materials. Mehat et al. (2012) identified the shrinkage behavior as one of the crucial problems in plastic moulded gear. On integrating the gray relational analysis and Taguchi method, the shrinkage behavior in tooth thickness, <b>addendum</b> and dedendum <b>circles</b> of moulded gear is investigated via optimization of process parameters. The melt temperature was the prominent parameter followed by packing pressure, cooling time and packing time.|$|R

40|$|Shrinkage {{behavior}} {{is a crucial}} problem in manufacturing plastic molded gear. This is because it negatively affects the dimensional stability and accuracy of the involute profile, {{as well as the}} concentricity, roundness, tooth spacing uniformity, and size of the gear. By integrating the Taguchi robust design, Grey relational analysis, and principal component analysis, we investigated the dimensional stability related to the shrinkage of tooth thickness, <b>addendum</b> <b>circle,</b> and dedendum circle of molded gear via the optimization of processing parameters and glass fiber reinforcement. The results revealed that the optimal combination of the processing parameters of the molded gear to achieve minimum shrinkage is melt temperature of 260 °C, packing pressure of 60 %, packing time of 5 [*]s, and cooling time of 30 [*]s. The melt temperature showed the highest comparability sequence among the four key process parameters examined, followed by packing pressure, cooling time, and packing time. Meanwhile, the presence of glass fibers induced higher deviations of tooth thickness, <b>addendum</b> <b>circle,</b> and dedendum circle than those of the unfilled polyamide 6 gears...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of optimal processing parameters {{is an important}} practice in the plastic injection moulding industry because of the significant effect of such parameters on plastic part quality and cost. However, the optimization design of injection moulding process parameters can be difficult because more than one quality characteristic {{is used in the}} evaluation. This study systematically develops a hybrid optimization method for multiple quality characteristics by integrating the Taguchi parameter design, grey relational analysis, and principal component analysis. A plastic gear is used to demonstrate the efficiency and validity of the proposed hybrid optimization method in controlling all influential injection moulding processing parameters during plastic gear manufacturing. To minimize the shrinkage behaviour in tooth thickness, <b>addendum</b> <b>circle,</b> and dedendum circle of moulded gear, the optimal combination of different process parameters is determined. The case study demonstrates that the proposed optimization method can produce plastic-moulded gear with minimum shrinkage behaviour of 1. 8 %, 1. 53 %, and 2. 42 % in tooth thickness, <b>addendum</b> <b>circle,</b> and dedendum circle, respectively; these values are less than the values in the main experiment. Therefore, shrinkage-related defects that lead to severe failure in plastic gears can be effectively minimized while satisfying the demand of the global plastic gear industry...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Twin screw {{vacuum pump}} is an {{important}} kind of dry vacuum pump, which is widely used in the oil-free vacuum system. The design of the screw rotor profile directly influences the working performance and manufacture cost of the screw pumps. In this paper, a new rotor profile for twin screw vacuum pump is introduced which is comprised of the cycloid curve, the dedendum circle arc, the involute curve and the <b>addendum</b> <b>circle</b> arc. The processes of three-dimensional modeling, motion simulation, interference checking and structural optimization for twin screw vacuum pumps are studied by means of Solidworks software.

40|$|I {{tried to}} {{manufacture}} mechamical element {{parts in the}} rolling method instead of the injection molding way. 1) As the result of cold rolling the free drive, the manufacturing was found possible 0. 1 M～ 0. 6 M.

Out of gear blanks got from logs rather than from blanks, a better result can be obtainable without any difference of strength caused by the directions of blanks. 3) As the rolled plastic has less mounding character than metals, gear blanks outside diamter coincides with <b>addendum</b> <b>circle</b> diameter of the finished gear. 4) Among the rolling conditions, the rolling speed is better when the rotating speed is low while the pressing speed of the die-rollers is great...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe 17 CrNiMo 6 {{steel is}} mainly {{used for the}} gear shaft of large modulus in many fields of heavy {{industry}} such as mining, transit, hoist, forging and so on[1]. The size of <b>addendum</b> <b>circle</b> and common normal line is changed a lot beyond the tolerance because of the long time of carburizing process and the out-of-step structural stress and thermal stress during the quenching process. And thus the posterior grinding efficiency and quality are influenced. In the paper comparison {{and analysis of the}} deformation affected by solid and hollow gear shafts were done and the methods of simulation and practice were both used. The results are as follows: the deformation of gear shaft was small before and after carburizing while that of gear shaft was large before and after quenching because of different cooling velocity, structure and hardness of each position. And the deformation of hollow was much smaller than that of solid. Therefore, if the hollow gear shaft is used, the waste of material will be decreased, and finishing cost will be reduced, and thus the technology of heat treatment will be optimized...|$|E
