25|$|At {{that time}} Anglo Irish Bank was badly {{affected}} by the downturn in the property market. On 28 September 2008, the Irish government {{made the decision to}} introduce a bank guarantee to cover Anglo Irish Bank, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland. Seán FitzPatrick was forced to resign in January 2009 over the Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy. The meeting, over a seven-hour period, took place over <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> and a subsequent dinner with Fitzpatrick and two other directors of Anglo Irish Bank.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Homer feels bored after Moe {{closed his}} bar to judge {{competitions}} {{and decides to}} spend time with Marge. After his presence at the house becomes too annoying, Marge decides to help him to find a new bar, but when this fails (due to the obnoxious customers), Grampa advises Marge to put Homer in <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>golf,</b> where he will become too distracted to even bother her again. However, before the game begins, Marge meets an elderly man who tells her that he got addictive to golf and barely saw his family again. Marge them realizes that she was going too far and stops Homer from playing, and they both end up having make up sex. In the end, in the reopening of his tavern, Moe explains that he was put on trial and, as punishment for his sociopathic behavior, he is not only banned from California, but is also forbidden from ever judging anything again anywhere in the country (he cannot even express his opinion on how much beer a person could drink before driving). But fortunately for Moe, he is also forbidden from watching the Fox network, something that he acknowledges as being a blessing in disguise, as this leads to an increase of the customers in his bar, including Rupert Murdoch, who asks him to put on The Jay Leno Show.|$|E
500|$|Former US President Bill Clinton {{has been}} a member of the club since May 2003. Donald Trump has said that he bought the club partly [...] "because he knew Bill Clinton would need a place to play". Part of the Clintons' gift for Bill's 65th {{birthday}} was <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> at Trump National with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton.|$|E
500|$|Much {{to their}} discontent, {{the media were}} not allowed to ask questions. Patrick Smith of The Age said, [...] "To deliver such bland {{explanations}} to the world media as they did yesterday and then not accept questions was contemptuous of the Australian public they have let down so badly." [...] The press attention was so intense that when Waugh attempted to relax with <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> at a local course, media helicopters flew overhead.|$|E

500|$|Blyton's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} in 1957, when during <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> {{she started to}} complain of feeling faint and breathless, and by 1960 she was displaying signs of dementia. Her agent George Greenfield recalled that it was [...] "unthinkable" [...] for the [...] "most famous and successful of children's authors with her enormous energy and computer-like memory" [...] to be losing her mind and suffering from what {{is now known as}} Alzheimer's disease in her mid-sixties. Blyton's situation was worsened by her husband's declining health throughout the 1960s; he suffered from severe arthritis in his neck and hips, deafness, and became increasingly ill-tempered and erratic until his death on 15 September 1967.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{contains}} a fictional obituary of Bond, purportedly published in The Times, which provided details of Bond's early life, {{although many of}} these were Fleming's own traits. These included Bond's expulsion from Eton College, {{which was part of}} Fleming's own history. As with a number of the previous Bond stories, You Only Live Twice used names of individuals and places that were from Fleming's past. Bond's mother, Monique Delacroix, was named after two women in Fleming's life: Monique Panchaud de Bottomes, a girl Fleming was engaged to in the early 1930s, with Delacroix taken from Fleming's own mother, whose maiden name was Ste Croix Rose. Bond's aunt was called Charmian Bond: Charmian was the name of Fleming's cousin who married Richard Fleming, Ian's brother. Charmian's sister was called [...] "Pet" [...] which, when combined with the Bottom from Monique Panchaud de Bottomes, gives Pett Bottom, where Charmian lives. Pett Bottom is also the name of a real place which amused Fleming when he stopped for lunch after <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> at Royal St George's Golf Club, Sandwich.|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{established}} transition {{headquarters in}} New York, but Agnew was {{not invited to}} meet with him there until November 27, when the two met for an hour. When Agnew spoke to reporters afterwards, he stated that he felt [...] "exhilarated" [...] with his new responsibilities, but did not explain what those were. During the transition period, Agnew traveled extensively, enjoying his new status. He vacationed on St. Croix, where he played <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> with Humphrey and Muskie. He went to Memphis for the 1968 Liberty Bowl, and to New York to attend the wedding of Nixon's daughter Julie to David Eisenhower. Agnew was a fan of the Baltimore Colts; in January, he was the guest of team owner Carroll Rosenbloom at Super Bowl III, and watched Joe Namath and the New York Jets upset the Colts, 16–7. There was as yet no official residence for the vice president, and Spiro and Judy Agnew secured a suite at the Sheraton Hotel in Washington formerly occupied by Johnson while vice president. Only one of their children, Kim, the youngest daughter, moved there with them, the others remaining in Maryland.|$|E
50|$|In golf, {{the nineteenth}} hole is a slang {{term for a}} pub, bar, or {{restaurant}} {{on or near the}} golf course, very often the clubhouse itself. <b>A</b> standard <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> has only eighteen holes, so golfers will say they are at the 'nineteenth hole', meaning they are enjoying a drink after the game. The concept is similar to Après-ski in skiing.|$|R

2500|$|An {{offshoot}} to his broadcasting {{career has}} been a string of movie and TV appearances as himself {{in the role of}} [...] "beloved golf great".

2500|$|After a poor {{series against}} South Africa in 1955 – where he {{suffered}} a permanent injury to the little finger {{of his left hand}} when acting as substitute wicket-keeper – he was dropped midway through the 1956 tour by the Australians and was not selected for the winter tour to South Africa. [...] Perhaps jokingly, he later put his failure to be selected for the South Africa tour {{to the fact that he}} had beaten the chairman of selectors, Gubby Allen, at <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>golf.</b> His form in county cricket in 1957, where he was the leading run-scorer for the second successive season, prompted his recall to play the West Indies. [...] Although he was dismissed for 0 at Lords, he scored 258 at Trent Bridge (his highest score in first-class cricket) and a further century later in the series. Poor performances in the following year and the 1958–59 tour to Australia again led to his being dropped. [...] One Australian journalist, the former cricket Jack Fingleton, said afterwards that he did not think that Graveney's [...] "smiling nature fits in with the seriousness of Test cricket".|$|E
2500|$|Another event dubbed a [...] "Battle of the Sexes" [...] {{took place}} during the 1998 Australian Open between Karsten Braasch and the Williams sisters. Venus and Serena Williams had claimed that they could beat any male player ranked outside the world's top 200, so Braasch, then ranked 203rd, {{challenged}} them both. Braasch was described by one journalist as [...] "a man whose training regime centered around a pack of cigarettes and more than a couple bottles of ice cold lager". The matches took place on court number 12 in Melbourne Park, after Braasch had finished <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> and two shandies. He first took on Serena and after leading 5–0, beat her 6–1. Venus then walked on court and again Braasch was victorious, this time winning 6–2. Braasch said afterwards, [...] "500 and above, no chance". He added that he had played like someone ranked 600th {{in order to keep the}} game [...] "fun". Braasch said the big difference was that men can chase down shots much easier, and that men put spin on the ball that the women can't handle. The Williams sisters adjusted their claim to beating men outside the top 350.|$|E

25|$|A {{handicap}} is {{a numerical}} measure of an amateur golfer's {{ability to play}} golf {{over the course of}} 18 holes. A player's handicap generally represents the number of strokes above par that the player will make over the course <b>of</b> <b>an</b> above-average <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>golf.</b> The better the player the lower their handicap is. Someone with a handicap of 0 or less is often called a scratch golfer, and would typically score or beat the course par on <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> play (depending on course difficulty).|$|R
50|$|Hope's co-stars include Edie Adams and Anita Ekberg playing secret agents. Golfer Arnold Palmer {{also makes}} a brief cameo, playing <b>a</b> crazy <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> with Hope - a scene {{revisited}} in the film Spies Like Us where Hope makes a cameo appearance and plays golf through a tent. A scene involving an unseen President John F. Kennedy in his famous rocking chair is parodied with his Russian counterpart Nikita Khrushchev rocking in a chair that squeaks loudly.|$|R
2500|$|Dewey's wife Frances died in July 1970, after battling {{breast cancer}} for six years. In {{the autumn of}} 1970, Dewey began to date actress Kitty Carlisle, and {{there was talk of}} {{marriage}} between them. On March 15, 1971, Dewey traveled to Miami, Florida for a brief golfing vacation with friend Dwayne Andreas and other associates. On March 16, following <b>a</b> <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> with Boston Red Sox player Carl Yastrzemski, he returned to his room in the Seaview Hotel to pack; he was due that evening at the White House in Washington to help celebrate the engagement of President Nixon's daughter, Tricia. When Dewey failed to appear for his ride to the Miami airport, a concerned Andreas convinced the hotel management to take him to Dewey's room. They found Dewey's body, fully dressed, lying on his back across the bed, and packed to leave. An autopsy determined that he had died suddenly from a massive heart attack. He was 68 years old, dying eight days before his 69th birthday. Following a public memorial service at Saint James' Episcopal Church in New York City, which was attended by President Nixon, former Vice President Hubert Humphrey, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, and other prominent politicians, Dewey was buried next to his wife Frances in the town cemetery of Pawling, New York. [...] After his death, his farm of Dapplemere was sold and renamed [...] "Dewey Lane Farm" [...] in his honor.|$|E

5000|$|Dressed to Kill is a 1928 silent film drama {{produced}} and distributed by Fox Film Corporation and starring Mary Astor and Edmund Lowe.
