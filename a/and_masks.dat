SICSIC routinely attends major BGSU sporting events and other campus activities promoting school spirit. The organization is secret and contains six members, two each for sophomore, junior and senior classes. Two new members are chosen {{at the end of}} their class's freshman year to replace that year's two graduating seniors.

5|$|The main Monpa festivals held in {{the monastery}} are the Choksar, Losar, Ajilamu, and Torgya. Choksar is the festival when the Lamas recite {{religious}} scriptures in the monasteries. Following the religious recitations, the villagers carry the scriptures on their back and circumambulate their agricultural land seeking blessings for good yield of crops without any infestations by pests and to protect against attack by wild animals. In the Losar festival, which {{marks the beginning of}} the Tibetan New Year, people visit the monastery and offer prayers. Torgya, also known as Tawang-Torgya, is an annual festival that is exclusively {{held in the}} monastery. It is held according to the Buddhist calendar days of 28th to 30th of Dawachukchipa, which corresponds to 10 to 12 January of the Gregorian calendar, and is a Monpa celebration. The objective of the festival is to ward off evil spirits and ushering all round prosperity and happiness {{to the people in the}} ensuing year. During the three-day festival, dances performed by artists in colorful costumes <b>and</b> <b>masks</b> are held in the courtyard, including the Pha Chan and the Losjker Chungiye, the latter of which is performed by the monks of the monastery. Each dance represents a myth and costumes <b>and</b> <b>masks</b> represent animal forms such as cows, tigers, sheep, monkeys and so forth.|$|E
5000|$|... 32-bit images (including 32-bit BITMAPINFOHEADER-format BMP images) are {{specifically}} a 24-bit image {{with the addition}} of an 8-bit channel for alpha compositing. Thus, in 32-bit images, the <b>AND</b> <b>mask</b> is not required, but recommended for consideration. Windows XP and higher will use a 32-bit image in less than True color mode by constructing an <b>AND</b> <b>mask</b> based on the alpha channel (if one does not reside with the image already) if no 24-bit version of the image is supplied in the ICO/CUR file. However, earlier versions of Windows interpret all pixels with 100% opacity unless an <b>AND</b> <b>mask</b> is supplied with the image. Supplying a custom <b>AND</b> <b>mask</b> will also allow for tweaking and hinting by the icon author. Even if the <b>AND</b> <b>mask</b> is not supplied, if the image is in Windows BMP format, the BMP header must still specify a doubled height.|$|R

5|$|When Voight began {{research}} at Mount Merapi in Java, Indonesia, in 1988, {{it was largely}} unknown to volcanologists. It had been omitted in the Smithsonian Institution's 1981 publication Volcanoes of the World, despite being densely populated, having close to a million people on its slopes as of 1996. Voight set up meters to record movement within the volcano, and educated local scientists on volcanic monitoring. In July 1989, he obtained a $250,000 grant from the National Science Foundation's Division of Natural and Manmade Hazard Mitigation for his proposal to predict eruptions at Merapi. After his funding ran out, he temporarily abandoned his research. An eruption from the volcano in 1994 produced pyroclastic flows that killed 63 people, including guests at a wedding ceremony. Returning to Merapi the following year, Voight compared data from the dead and survivors, including {{the extent of their}} burn areas, clothing worn, and lung damage. He concluded that protective, long-sleeved clothing <b>and</b> <b>masks</b> enhance chances of survival when exposed to eruptive activity.|$|E
