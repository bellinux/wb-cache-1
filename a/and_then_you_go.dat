You count how many fish you have caught <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> home regardless of how many fish you have caught. Each fish has a probability of getting into the net that is proportional to its weight but independent of what happens to the other fish.|$|E
500|$|Columbus {{general manager}} Mark McCullers {{expressed}} {{concerns about the}} fairness of the scheduling since he claimed {{it would be difficult for}} the Crew to travel to the West Coast on October 5 and then return to Chicago three days later for a league match. Crew head coach Robert Warzycha also complained about the scheduling saying, [...] "You make it to a final, but you have to go to Seattle on Sunday after playing a home game on Saturday... You've got to fly all day, play on the (artificial) turf on Tuesday <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> play an important MLS game in Chicago on Friday. Great." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Insane Clown Posse albums, The Tempest is {{not connected}} to the Dark Carnival mythology, which {{formed the basis for}} ICP's [...] "Joker's Cards" [...] series, which began in 1992 with Carnival of Carnage and concluded with the albums [...] and Hell's Pit; however, it references themes, concepts and songs from previous albums. Joseph Bruce (Violent J) said that The Tempest is a concept album in its own right. Bruce describes the album's concept as relating to both a violent storm which turns into a tornado and pulls people into a hurricane as well as a roller coaster. According to Bruce, [...] "That's a lot like riding on a violent roller coaster, I'd assume. You get jerked to the left, jerked to the right, sucked way up into the sky, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> shooting down to the floor, and then you jerk up to the left and then you whip around to the right. Well, The Tempest is a storm {{in the form of a}} roller coaster." [...] As a result of this concept, the album focuses on a variety of different moods.|$|E

[...] "You will stop. <b>You</b> will <b>go</b> to Poppensdorf and to Kreitzberg, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> will <b>go</b> to Gottesberg, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> will <b>go</b> to Rolandseck, {{where there is}} a boat that will take you to Drachenfels, or to Koenigswinter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] said Grant quietly, [...] "don't you {{remember}} that your daughter Euphemia said something that evening about the land Lige had OFFERED you, and you snapped up the young lady rather sharply for letting out secrets, <b>and</b> <b>THEN</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> out? At least that's my impression." ...|$|R
2500|$|Referring to the perception, {{especially}} in the West, that India had previously been lecturing the world about the virtues of nonviolence, President Kennedy told the Indian ambassador to the US, [...] "You spend {{the last fifteen years}} preaching morality to us, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> ahead and act the way any normal country would behave… People are saying, the preacher has been caught coming out of the brothel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Evans' heroin {{addiction}} {{began in the}} late 1950s, and increased following LaFaro's death. His girlfriend Ellaine was also an addict. Evans habitually had to borrow money from friends, and eventually, his electricity and telephone services were shut down. Evans said, [...] "You don't understand. It's like death and transfiguration. Every day you wake in pain like death <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> out and score, and that is transfiguration. Each day becomes all of life in microcosm." ...|$|E
2500|$|Piper espouses a {{brand of}} creationism known as [...] "Historical Creationism", and credits John Sailhamer's book Genesis Unbound to {{explaining}} the view. [...] "Historical Creationism" [...] states that God created the universe, planet Earth, and many creatures and things within Earth itself {{over the course of}} an indefinite time period before {{the first day of the}} week of Genesis 1, and that the days of the creation week were God changing a desolate piece of land into the blessed region of Eden, where God would bring Adam and Eve into existence and place them within it on the sixth day. [...] "In verse 1, [...] " [...] Piper said, [...] "'In the beginning he made the heavens and the earth,' he makes everything. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> day by day and he's preparing the land. He's not bringing new things into existence; he's preparing the land and causing things to grow and separating out water and earth. And then, when it's all set and prepared, he creates and puts man there." [...] Piper acknowledged, however, that although it is his interpretation of the text, he is not dogmatic about the issue and that [...] "every pastor should go ahead and say what he believes...I'm inclined to not draw that too narrowly." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't suppose, really, that you're aware what a devil's {{argument}} that is," [...] said Westover. [...] "You got Lynde drunk, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> {{back to his}} sister, and allowed her to treat you {{as if you were}} a gentleman, and didn't deserve to be thrown out of the house." [...] This at last was something like what Westover had imagined he would say to Jeff, and he looked to see it have the imagined effect upon him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could make}} out what the devil it was that {{happened}} to you," [...] he said. [...] "Why, {{you used to be}} as smart as they make 'em, a regular nipper after business. I expected you'd be after me for a partnership before long, and I expect I'd have had to give it <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> clean dotty. I shall never forget that day at the sale, when you began telling people everything it wasn't good for them to know." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now, don't {{let that}} bother you, Sam. You {{can go to}} New York with me this Summer, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> back to college, and come out {{at the head of}} the class. That will surely please us all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You go up--but you hadn't {{ought to}} hit em', if you're careful. The {{thing is to}} get hold of the first mine all right, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> on to the next, and so on, in a way o' speakin'." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You needn't {{tell him}} {{anything}} about it," [...] advised Felicity. [...] "Just keep quiet {{and go to}} the Methodist church until <b>you</b> get big, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> can <b>go</b> where <b>you</b> please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{no matter}} {{at what cost}} to your amour propre. You should have remembered you were engaged. You forgot that, too, I suppose. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> and forget your quarrel. It's the most hopeless {{exhibition}} of levity I ever heard of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --Longworth is awfully sick, he said, {{after what}} {{you wrote about}} that old hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> and slate her drivel to Jaysus. Couldn't you do the Yeats touch? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expected}} {{better of}} you," [...] Grimstone said angrily. [...] "Foggy, indeed! I've been anxious and worried all day.

6000|$|... "Nor I," [...] agreed Psmith. [...] "Your narratives, Comrade Maloney, {{always seem}} to me to suffer from a certain lack of construction. You start at the end, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> back to any portion of the story which happens to appeal to you at the moment, {{eventually}} winding up at the beginning. Why should the fact that this stripling's father has come over from Italy to work on the Subway be a misfortune?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But not--not again--not {{for a long}} while. I {{want you}} to respect me. Maybe it wasn't wrong, dear, but it was terribly dangerous. Come, let's stand out in the cool air on the roof for a while <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> must <b>go</b> home." ...|$|R
6000|$|When Kipps {{was clear}} what an anagram meant, Coote {{came to the}} second heading, the Tea.

6000|$|Mr. Babcock {{buried his}} head in both hands. At last looking up, [...] "I don't think you {{appreciate}} my position," [...] he said.
