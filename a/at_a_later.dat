5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of rhabdomyolysis may be suspected in {{anyone who has}} suffered trauma, crush injury or prolonged immobilization, {{but it may also}} be identified <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> stage due to deteriorating kidney function (abnormally raised or increasing creatinine and urea levels, falling urine output) or reddish-brown discoloration of the urine.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Earth, Van den Berg {{continued to work}} on crystal growth experiments at EG in California and he became the head for the section of materials science. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> time he moved to Florida to become a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72, he continued to work up to 40 hours a week and grow crystals, a process he compares to gardening. The crystals he grows (Mercuric Iodide crystals) are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. These detectors are used in medical applications, by the defense industry and the International Atomic Energy Agency.|$|E

5|$|After the Norman Conquest, Gisa {{supported}} William, the {{new king}} of England. He helped consecrate Lanfranc as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1070, and attended the Council of Windsor in 1072 and the Council of London in 1075. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> church council, Giso asserted his {{authority over the}} abbots of Muchelney and Athelney, but failed to uphold the same claim in regards to Thurstan, Abbot of Glastonbury. Previously, he was credited {{as the author of}} Historiola de primordiis episcopatus Somersetensis, a history of the bishops of Wells, but he is no longer considered the author of that work.|$|E
5|$|Altar 13 {{is another}} early Maya {{monument}} {{dating to the}} Late Preclassic. Like Altar12 it was probably originally erected as a vertical stela. At some point it was deliberately broken, with severe damage inflicted upon the main portion of the sculpture, obliterating the central and lower portions. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> date it was reused as a horizontal altar. The remains of two figures can be seen flanking the damage lower portion of the monument and the large head of the sacred bird survives above the area of damage. The right hand figure is wearing an interwoven skirt and is probably female.|$|E
5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E

Obstacle breaching and bridgelaying variants may also be acquired <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> date.

5|$|Blue and Red Landers, {{recurring}} {{characters in}} many Compile games, increase the player's maximum life and power chip capacities, respectively. Blue Landers play multiple roles in The Guardian Legend. Some {{of them are}} not items but non-player characters that dispense advice to the player or exchange upgrades for power chips; others provide a password that allows the player to resume the game <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> time with their progress retained. These Blue Landers also serve as checkpoints; players can restart their game in these designated rooms after being defeated provided the system has not been turned off.|$|E
5|$|Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is {{recommended}} after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems {{in and around}} the brain. MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. If someone attends the emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> point. If a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures.|$|E
5|$|During a later court {{session on}} September 9, Takaesu {{attempted}} to submit medical evidence that Brown {{had suffered a}} back injury in 1999 and had a steel collar and bolts inserted around his spine.

The Naha court panel of three judges agreed to issue a decision as to whether the evidence was submissable <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> date.|$|E

5|$|Excavations in {{the acropolis}} {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} at least two superimposed platforms built with finely dressed stone blocks and covered with good quality stucco flooring. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> date the platforms and courtyard were covered with unworked stones bound with mortar and covered with another stucco floor. The two platforms were built in the Late Classic and appear to have been covered over in the Terminal Classic.|$|E
5|$|Few of the {{original}} windows survive in the tower, but those that remain are larger than {{in some of the}} other older peles, suggesting it may have been built with defence less in mind than in some earlier pele towers. The originals have mainly been replaced by 17th- and 18th-century versions. The original roof would have resembled that at nearby Yanwath Hall, but was replaced <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> date with the current hipped-roof design, probably during the late 16th or 17th centuries. The current roof was further restored in 1979.|$|E

The information in the score report includes the date, location of the game, the names of the teams, the names of the umpires who officiated the game, the final score, and the data that is required in rule 10.02.|$|E
