40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{alkaline}} protease (AP) {{has recently}} been shown to produce limited proteolysis of human gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and thereby destroy the antiviral and macrophage-activating activities of the lymphokine. In the present study we describe some {{of the characteristics of}} Pseudomonas elastase (E) with regard to inactivation of human IFN-gamma. The inhibitory effect of E on IFN-gamma bioactivity differed from that of AP in that the direct effects of E were reduced in the presence of human serum. That this property of human serum was in large part attributable to the protease inhibitor alpha 2 -macroglobulin (alpha 2 -M) was suggested by the following observations: (i) methylamine treatment of serum reduced its effect on E, (ii) E interacted directly with alpha 2 -M to induce a characteristic conformational change in the protease inhibitor, and (iii) preformed E-alpha 2 -M complexes lacked IFN-gamma-degrading activity. Despite these findings, <b>anti-E</b> <b>antiserum</b> partially neutralized the effect that a Pseudomonas filtrate showed on IFN-gamma, suggesting that E contributes to the activity of bacterial filtrates. Treatment of IFN-gamma with E {{in the presence of a}} suboptimal concentration of AP resulted in an E dose-dependent inactivation of the lymphokine. Preformed E-alpha 2 -M complexes, although ineffective by themselves at cleaving IFN-gamma, degraded the lymphokine, providing AP was also present in the reaction mixture. These data demonstrate that the destruction of small, biologically significant peptides by Pseudomonas proteases can involve protease-protease synergy that acts even in the presence of the serum protease inhibitor alpha 2 -M...|$|E
40|$|We used severe {{combined}} immunodeficient (SCID) mice {{to study}} resistance to invasive infection with Entamoeba histolytica. Seven of seven SCID mice developed liver abscesses when challenged intrahepatically with virulent HM 1 :IMSS strain E. histolytica trophozoites. Only {{one of seven}} similarly challenged immunocompetent congenic C. B- 17 mice developed an abscess. Adoptive transfer of polyclonal rabbit <b>anti-E.</b> histolytica <b>antiserum,</b> but not preimmune rabbit serum, completely protected 7 of 12 SCID mice from intrahepatic challenge with ameba. These results demonstrate that lymphocyte-based immunity is important in protection against amebic liver abscess, and that anti-E. histolytica antibody can protect against amebic infection in this system. The SCID mouse may provide a powerful model for studying the components of protective immunity to invasive amebiasis...|$|R

Phylogenetic {{position}} and codon usage of two centrin genes from the rumen ciliate protozoan, Entodinium caudatum. FEMS Microbiology Letters, 166 (1), 147 - 154. A lambda phage cDNA expression library was constructed from washed suspensions of the rumen ciliate protozoan, Endodinium caudatum, {{which had been}} maintained in an isolated, monofaunated sheep. The library was screened using an <b>anti-E.</b> caudatum <b>antiserum</b> raised in rabbits against sonically disrupted protozoa. DNA sequences for two centrins or caltractins, a subfamily of the EF-hand Ca 2 +-modulaled proteins which are closely related, highly conserved cytoskelelal proteins, were identified and characterised. Their phylogenetic position was established relative to other centrin gene sequences. The two proteins showed homology to Paramecium tetraurelia centrins: 50 and 52 % identities and 71 and 75 % similarities in the protein sequence, over 99 and 110 amino acids fragments. Codon usage and indices revealed that E. caudatum follows universal codon usage, but with a restricted number of codons, and has a low G+C content.

40|$|Ixodid ticks were {{collected}} from Connecticut, Massachusetts, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and British Columbia (Canada) during 1991 to 1994 to determine the prevalence of infection with hemocytic (blood cell), rickettsia-like organisms. Hemolymph obtained from these ticks was analyzed by direct and indirect fluorescent antibody (FA) staining methods with dog, horse, or human sera containing antibodies to Ehrlichia canis, Ehrlichia equi, or Rickettsia rickettsii. Of the 693 nymphal and adult Amblyomma americanum, Dermacentor variabilis, Ixodes scapularis, and Ixodes pacificus ticks tested with dog <b>anti-E.</b> canis <b>antiserum,</b> 209 (32. 5 %) contained hemocytic bacteria. The prevalence of infected ticks varied greatly with species and locale. In parallel tests of duplicate hemolymph preparations from adult I. scapularis ticks, the hemocytic organisms reacted positively with E. canis and/or E. equi antisera, including sera from persons who had granulocytic ehrlichiosis. In separate PCR analyses, DNA of the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis was detected in 59 (50. 0 %) of 118 adult and in 1 of 2 nymphal I. scapularis ticks tested from Connecticut. There {{was no evidence of}} Ehrlichia chaffeensis DNA in these ticks. In indirect FA tests of hemolymph for spotted fever group rickettsiae, the overall prevalence of infection was less than 4 %. Specificity tests of antigens and antisera used in these studies revealed no cross-reactivity between E. canis and E. equi or between any of the ehrlichial reagents and those of R. rickettsii. The geographic distribution of hemocytic microorganisms with shared antigens to Ehrlichia species or spotted fever group rickettsiae is widespread...|$|R
40|$|Two {{alternatively}} spliced {{products of}} the human E 2 A gene, E 12 and E 47, encode helix-loop-helix DNA-binding proteins. Here we describe the isolation of two Xenopus cDNAs; one, XE 12, is structurally similar to human E 12 and the other contains a sequence similar to E 47. Transcripts of both cDNAs are present at all the stages of Xenopus development tested and in all regions of the embryo. The DNA binding properties of in vitro translated XE 12 are indistinguishable from those of human E 12. We have shown previously that an embryonic muscle DNA-binding activity, EMF 1, that binds to a promoter sequence required {{for the expression of}} the cardiac actin gene, contains the Xenopus myogenic factor XMyoD. Here we show that it also contains protein that interacts with an <b>anti-E</b> 12 <b>antiserum,</b> suggesting that XE 12 and XMyoD proteins, or very similar ones, are present in EMF 1. We have addressed the functional role of XE 12 in muscle gene transcription in Xenopus embryos by injecting in vitro synthesized RNA into the two cell embryo. Overexpression of XE 12 and XMyoD augments by greater than 10 -fold the ectopic activation of the endogenous cardiac actin gene that can be produced by XMyoD alone. Our DNA binding results strongly suggest that this effect is mediated through a direct interaction of the XE 12 -XMyoD complex with specific sites in the cardiac actin promoter. We suggest that XE 12 is functionally important in muscle gene activation in embryonic development...|$|R
40|$|The Bacillus subtilis homolog of the Escherichia coli ftsZ gene was {{isolated}} by screening a B. subtilis genomic library with <b>anti-E.</b> coli FtsZ <b>antiserum.</b> DNA sequence {{analysis of a}} 4 -kilobase region revealed three open reading frames. One of these coded for a protein that was about 50 % homologous to the E. coli FtsZ protein. The open reading frame just upstream of ftsZ coded for a protein that was 34 % homologous to the E. coli FtsA protein. The open reading frames flanking these two B. subtilis genes showed no relationship {{to those found in}} E. coli. Expression of the B. subtilis ftsZ and ftsA genes in E. coli was lethal, since neither of these genes could be cloned on plasmid vectors unless promoter sequences were first removed. Cloning the B. subtilis ftsZ gene {{under the control of the}} lac promoter resulted in an IPTGs phenotype that could be suppressed by overproduction of E. coli FtsZ. These genes mapped at 135 degrees on the B. subtilis genetic map near previously identified cell division mutations...|$|R
40|$|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) {{and other}} viruses within the herpes group have {{recently}} been shown to induce Fc receptors in infected monolayers. We have examined the possibility that such receptors might facilitate the adherence of antibody-coated bacteria to CMV-infected cells. To do this, we infected confluent human embryonic lung (HEL) cell monolayers with CMV (strain AD 169) and then used a double radiolabel assay to measure adherence of Escherichia coli 06 to both infected and control monolayers. We examined infected monolayers 48 h after viral seeding, at which time 30 - 60 % of the cells exhibited characteristic cytopathic changes. We compared the adherence of untreated E. coli 06 with the adherence of E. coli 06 that had been preincubated for 1 h at 37 degrees C with either nonimmune or <b>anti-E.</b> coli 06 <b>antiserum.</b> Pretreatment of the E. coli 06 with specific antiserum significantly enhanced its adherence to CMV-infected, but not to control, monolayers (P less than 0. 01 by the Mann-Whitney U test). We did not see such enhancement when we used <b>anti-E.</b> coli 06 <b>antiserum</b> to treat a nontypable E. coli. The augmented adherence of antibody-coated E. coli 06 to CMV-infected monolayers was abrogated by pretreating the monolayers with nonimmune serum or purified Fc fragments, but not by pretreating with IgA, IgM, or 1 mM trypan blue. Preincubating HEL cell monolayers with 100 U/ml human leukocyte interferon for 72 h at 37 degrees C {{did not affect the}} adherence of antibody-coated E. coli 06 to the monolayers. To determine if antibody-coated bacteria that adhered to the surface of CMV-infected monolayers might themselves act as receptors for microorganisms with Fc binding potential, we compared the adherence of Cowan strain Staphylococcus aureus to CMV-infected and control monolayers that had been preincubated with antibody-coated E. coli 06. The S. aureus adhered significantly better to the former monolayers (P less than 0. 001). These results illustrate a previously unrecognized mechanism by which certain herpesviruses might enhance the adherence of secondary pathogens to nonphagocytic cell populations. Such a mechanism, if active in vivo, might facilitate the colonization of mucosal surfaces by these pathogenic microorganisms, and in this way might contribute to both the reported predisposition of CMV-infected patients to secondary infections and to the high prevalence of S. aureus in the vaginal flora of women with histories of genital herpes...|$|R
40|$|We used severe {{combined}} immunodeficient (SCID) mice {{to study}} resistance to invasive infection with Entamoeba histolytica. Seven of seven SCID mice developed liver abscesses when challenged intrahepatically with virulent HMI:IMSS strain 15. histolytica trophozoites. Only {{one of seven}} similarly challenged immunocompetent congenic C. B- 17 mice developed an abscess. Adoptive transfer of polyclonal rabbit <b>anti-E,</b> histolytica <b>antiserum,</b> but not preimmune rabbit serum, completely protected 7 of 12 SCID mice from intrahepatic challenge with ameba. These results demonstrate that lymphocyte-based immunity is important in protection against amebic liver abscess, and that anti-E, histolytica antibody can protect against amebic infection in this system. The SCID mouse may provide a powerful model for studying the components of protective immunity to invasive amebiasis. T he protozoan Entamoeba histolytica causes an estimated 36, 000, 000 cases of disabling colitis or liver abscess and kills at least 40, 000 people annually, ranking it third worldwide among parasitic causes of death (1). Despite intensive research {{over the past two}} decades, the precise mechanisms of protective immunity to amebiasis have not been defined (2). Part of the problem has been the lack of a suitable animal model. SCID mice lack functional B and T cells (3), a defect that can be corrected adoptive transfer of normal routine splenocytes (4). SCID mice have intact macrophage and NK cellmediated immunity (5, 6). SCID mouse models have proved useful in studies of resistance to a number of viral (7 - 9), bacterial (10, 11), helminth (12), and protozoan pathogens (13, 14). We report here the establishment of a SCID mouse model for amebic liver abscess, and the use of this model to demonstrate that immune serum protects against visceral E. histolytica infection...|$|R
40|$|An antigen {{common to}} {{most members of}} the family Enterobacteriaceae was first {{described}} by Kunin and coworkers (1, 2) and confirmed by Whang and Neter (3) and by Vosti etal. (4). Common antigen (CA) 1 was detected by passive hemagglutination with rabbit antiserum to Escherichia coli 014. This antiserum agglutinated red cells coated with crude lipopolysaccharides from most E. coli 0 serotypes (1) and from some species of Salmonella, Shigella, Proteus, and Aerobacter (2). Aoki et al. (5) demonstrated the presence of CA in the cell wall of species of E. coli, Klebsiella-Aerobacter, and Proteus by the indirect immunofluorescence technique using <b>anti-E,</b> coli 014 <b>antiserum.</b> Only immunization with E. coli 014 {{and to a lesser extent}} with E. coli 056, 0124, and 0144 gave rise to antibodies against CA (1). Whang et al. (6) also demonstrated that the immune response to CA was markedly suppressed when ethanolsoluble CA from S. typhimurium (7) was injected together with lipid A from E. coli or Salmonella. Hemagglufination-inhibition experiments indicated that the CA activities of lipopolysaccharide preparations from different E. coli 0 serotypes varied (8, 9). E. coli 014 contained large amounts of common antigen. Kunin (8) also demonstrate...|$|R
40|$|The ftsZ (sulB) gene of Escherichia coli {{codes for}} a 40, 000 -dalton protein that carries out a key {{step in the}} cell {{division}} pathway. The presence of an ftsZ gene protein in other bacterial species was examined {{by a combination of}} Southern blot and Western blot analyses. Southern blot analysis of genomic restriction digests revealed that many bacteria, including species from six members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, contained sequences which hybridized with an E. coli ftsZ probe. Genomic DNA from more distantly related bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus, did not hybridize under minimally stringent conditions. Western blot analysis, with <b>anti-E.</b> coli FtsZ <b>antiserum,</b> revealed that all bacterial species examined contained a major immunoreactive band. Several of the Enterobacteriaceae were transformed with a multicopy plasmid encoding the E. coli ftsZ gene. These transformed strains, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, were shown to overproduce the FtsZ protein and to produce minicells. Analysis of [35 S]methionine-labeled minicells revealed that the plasmid-encoded gene products were the major labeled species. This demonstrated that the E. coli ftsZ gene could function in other bacterial species to induce minicells and that these minicells could be used to analyze plasmid-endoced gene products...|$|R
40|$|Acetyl {{coenzyme}} A synthetase (Acs) activates acetate to acetyl coenzyme A {{through an}} acetyladenylate intermediate; two other enzymes, acetate kinase (Ack) and phosphotransacetylase (Pta), activate acetate through an acetyl phosphate intermediate. We subcloned acs, the Escherichia coli {{open reading frame}} purported to encode Acs (F. R. Blattner, V. Burland, G. Plunkett III, H. J. Sofia, and D. L. Daniels, Nucleic Acids Res. 21 : 5408 - 5417, 1993). We constructed a mutant allele, delta acs::Km, with the central 0. 72 -kb BclI-BclI portion of acs deleted, and recombined it into the chromosome. Whereas wild-type cells grew well on acetate across {{a wide range of}} concentrations (2. 5 to 50 mM), those deleted for acs grew poorly on low concentrations (or = 25 mM), and those deleted for acs, ackA, and pta did not grow on acetate at any concentration tested. Expression of acs from a multicopy plasmid restored growth to cells deleted for all three genes. Relative to wild-type cells, those deleted for acs did not activate acetate as well, those deleted for ackA and pta displayed even less activity, and those deleted for all three genes did not activate acetate at any concentration tested. Induction of acs resulted in expression of a 72 -kDa protein, as predicted by the reported sequence. This protein immunoreacted with antiserum raised against purified Acs isolated from an unrelated species, Methanothrix soehngenii. The purified E. coli Acs then was used to raise <b>anti-E.</b> coli Acs <b>antiserum,</b> which immunoreacted with a 72 -kDa protein expressed by wild-type cells but not by those deleted for acs. When purified in the presence, but not in the absence, of coenzyme A, the E. coli enzyme activated acetate across a wide range of concentrations in a coenzyme A-dependent manner. On the basis of these and other observations, we conclude that this open reading frame encodes the acetate-activating enzyme, Acs...|$|R
