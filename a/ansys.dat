25|$|When {{there are}} many degrees of freedom, one method of {{visualizing}} the mode shapes is by animating them using structural analysis software such as Femap or <b>ANSYS.</b> An example of animating mode shapes {{is shown in the}} figure below for a cantilevered -beam as demonstrated using modal analysis on <b>ANSYS.</b> In this case, the finite element method was used to generate an approximation of the mass and stiffness matrices by meshing the object of interest in order to solve a discrete eigenvalue problem. Note that, in this case, the finite element method provides an approximation of the meshed surface (for which there exists an infinite number of vibration modes and frequencies). Therefore, this relatively simple model that has over 100 degrees of freedom and hence as many natural frequencies and mode shapes, provides a good approximation for the first natural frequencies and modes. Generally, only the first few modes are important for practical applications.|$|E

2500|$|This {{field is}} not new, {{as the basis}} of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) or Finite Element Method (FEM) dates back to 1941. [...] But the {{evolution}} of computers has made FEA/FEM a viable option for analysis of structural problems. Many commercial codes such as <b>ANSYS,</b> NASTRAN, and ABAQUS are widely used in industry for research and the design of components. Some 3D modeling and CAD software packages have added FEA modules. [...] In the recent times, cloud simulation platforms like SimScale are becoming more common.|$|E
2500|$|The {{theoretical}} {{foundation for}} the XDEM was developed in 1999 by Peters, who described incineration of a wooden moving bed on a forward acting grate. [...] The concept was later also employed by Sismsek et al. to predict the furnace process of a grate firing system. Applications to the complex processes of a blast furnace have been attempted by Shungo et al. Numerical simulation of fluid injection into a gaseous environment nowadays is adopted by {{a large number of}} CFD-codes codes such as Star-CD of CD-adapco, <b>Ansys</b> and AVL-Fire. Droplets of a spray are treated by a zero-dimensional approach to account for heat and mass transfer to the fluid phase.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2008, NIST {{released}} its final {{report on the}} causes of the collapse of 7World Trade Center. This followed their August 21, 2008 draft report which included a period for public comments. In its investigation, NIST utilized <b>ANSYS</b> to model events leading up to collapse initiation and LS-DYNA models to simulate the global response to the initiating events. NIST determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role, nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the twin towers, nor did the transfer elements (trusses, girders, and cantilever overhangs). But the lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing floor beams near Column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, Column 79 soon buckled – pulling the East penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the entire building above to fall downward as a single unit. [...] From collapse timing measurements taken from a video of the north face of the building, NIST observed that the building's exterior facade fell at free fall acceleration through a distance of approximately 8 stories (32 meters, or 105 feet), noting [...] "the collapse time was approximately 40 percent longer than that of free fall for the first 18 stories of descent." [...] The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.|$|E
