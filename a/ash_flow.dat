5|$|In {{comparison}} to the well-preserved rocks of the dry, {{central part of the}} Andes, the record that defines the southern sector is poorly preserved. Remnants of Miocene and Quaternary eruptions within the central part are clearly preserved in the rock record. <b>Ash</b> <b>flow</b> sheets constitute as much as 40percent of the area's total erupted material, suggesting that pyroclastic eruptions were rather important during this time. By examining the eruption rate of individual volcanoes, Hildreth et al. concluded that similar amounts of ash-flow volcanism took place in the southern sector as well. Their study established that in particular silicic ash was missing from the record, and concluded that erosion had probably disrupted deposition of volcaniclastic rock.|$|E
25|$|The {{first phase}} {{was from the}} late Oligocene to early Miocene {{and at that time}} thirty to fifty percent of the Rio Grande rift was made; {{volcanism}} at that time included basaltic andesites, andesites, and silicic <b>ash</b> <b>flow</b> tuffs.|$|E
25|$|The Intercaldera Sequence {{comprises}} formations that crop {{out from}} overlying flows in triangularly shaped area, and includes thick volcanic ash (tuff), thick breccia layers, and intermediate to felsic igneous rocks {{that tend to}} intrude the above layers and are typically located along caldera margin faults. The Exocaldera Sequence contains <b>ash</b> <b>flow</b> tuffs, mafic lavas, alluvial redbeds, and porphyritic felsic lavas that are distributed across five different layers. The late Caldera-Fill Sequence contains rocks {{that are similar to}} those of the outflows of the other, older layers, and comprises two formations and two relatively minor intrusive lava flows. The volcanic flows are generally mafic. The stratigraphic subdivision is supported by geochemical and mineralogical analyses, which indicate that the basaltic rocks are mantle-derived and have, unusually, relatively intraplate (or hotspot) type chemical affinities. The multiple andesite flows were probably derived from basaltic magma by the crystallization of the magma material. The relatively rare, more felsic flow units, are thought to have originated from high-end crystallization inside the magma chamber. The various stages of fractionation are continually interrupted by eruptions, and have allowed scientists to recognize seven stages of caldera development. The genesis of the caldera is related to a period of lithospheric thinning that followed the Acadian Orogeny in the northern Appalachians.|$|E

With a volume of [...] to , it was smaller than the second eruption, but acted similarly, and had much more densely welded tuff.

500|$|After the basal {{shield volcano}} was constructed, several vents {{produced}} oversaturated, undersaturated, peralkaline and metaluminous lavas. This tremendous {{variation in the}} erupted magmas and influence of adjacent vents {{gave rise to a}} high and volumnous complex bimodal stratovolcano centrally located atop the shield. Mapping indicates that the headwaters of Kakuchuya Creek were the site of this large stratovolcano cap and that it grew over [...] in elevation. Volcanic rocks of felsic composition, notably peralkaline trachyte and comendite, were the primary products comprising this edifice, forming more than 80% of its volume. Explosive eruptions during this stage of activity deposited basalt agglomerates, ash fall and <b>ash</b> <b>flow</b> tuffs. Peralkaline felsic lava flows reached [...] long and [...] thick.

2500|$|In the Oligocene, <b>ash</b> <b>flows</b> {{became the}} {{predominant}} deposit of the area, with interbedded lava <b>flows</b> between.

The ignimbrite formations in this area cover the largest area of any known series, with ten calderas identified in the province. [...] Three of these calderas are in Copper Canyon. The lava has formed a series of mafic rock that form the Southern Cordilleran Basaltic Andesite Suite. The tuffs are above a thick formation of lava rock. Around five or six units have been identified, mostly around the Copper Canyon area. These tuffs have allowed wide-ranging correlation with formations in other geographical areas, for example Death Valley.|$|R
