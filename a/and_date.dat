40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to gain greater {{understanding}} of how bullying impacts the link between child maltreatment <b>and</b> <b>dating</b> violence. The first research question examined how well a structural equation model with the pathways from child maltreatment through moral disengagement, emotion dysregulation, <b>and</b> bullying to <b>dating</b> violence explained the relationship between child maltreatment <b>and</b> <b>dating</b> violence. The second research question analyzed the impact bullying had on improving the model 2 ̆ 7 s ability to predict dating violence. The third and fourth research questions determined the mediating effect of moral disengagement and emotion dysregulation on bullying involvement <b>and</b> <b>dating</b> violence involvement, respectfully. The final research question examined the moderating effects of bully/victim roles. Results suggested that moral disengagement significantly predicted involvement in dating violence while emotion dysregulation significantly predicted involvement in both bullying <b>and</b> <b>dating</b> violence. Additionally, a model including bullying explained the relationship between child maltreatment <b>and</b> <b>dating</b> violence slightly better than a model without the bullying construct. Implications for the prevention and intervention of bullying <b>and</b> <b>dating</b> violence involvement are discussed. ...|$|R
