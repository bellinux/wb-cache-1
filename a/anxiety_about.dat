5|$|In {{the first}} few weeks of 2010, there was renewed <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> {{excessive}} national debt, with lenders demanding ever-higher interest rates from several countries with higher debt levels, deficits, and current account deficits. This in turn made it difficult for four out of eighteen Eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or refinance existing government debt, particularly when economic growth rates were low, and when a high percentage of debt was in the hands of foreign creditors, {{as in the case of}} Greece and Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{is deeply}} troubled by Pfaster's crimes, and has unsettling dreams and {{hallucinations}} about the case. In Washington, {{she has a}} counseling session with a social worker, during which she shares her <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> the investigation. After the session, Scully learns that someone from Minnesota had called for her. When she contacts Mulder, she learns that neither he nor Bocks made the call. Tracing a fingerprint to Pfaster from his arrest, Bocks and Mulder raid his apartment, finding one of the prostitute's fingers in his refrigerator. Meanwhile, after Scully arrives in Minneapolis, Pfaster forces her car off the road. He kidnaps Scully and takes her to his late mother's abandoned house. He ties and gags Scully, and keeps her in a dark closet.|$|E

5|$|The couple {{established}} Marlborough House {{as their}} London residence and Sandringham House in Norfolk as their country retreat. They entertained on a lavish scale. Their marriage met with disapproval in certain circles {{because most of}} Queen Victoria's relations were German, and Denmark was at loggerheads with Germany over the territories of Schleswig and Holstein. When Alexandra's father inherited the throne of Denmark in November 1863, the German Confederation {{took the opportunity to}} invade and annex Schleswig-Holstein. Queen Victoria was of two minds whether it was a suitable match given the political climate. After the marriage, she expressed <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> their socialite lifestyle and attempted to dictate to them on various matters, including the names of their children.|$|E
5|$|Liddell {{entered the}} youth team on {{his arrival in}} 1938. Before he {{established}} himself in the side, Liddell had been frustrated at the frequent rotation of players until trainer Albert Shelley advised him to be patient. An injury incurred against Blackburn Rovers threatened to end his career prematurely. He had struck his knee against concrete near the corner flag after being challenged while running with the ball. Doctors informed him {{of the extent of}} tissue damage, causing Liddell <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> his future. He remained in Blackburn for two weeks, living in the family home of a colleague, before returning to Liverpool to continue his recovery. The Second World War precluded an official debut for Liddell, as the Football Association suspended competitive football from the abandoned 1939–1940 season and instituted a regional system in its place. Until the cessation of hostilities in 1945, Liddell guested for various domestic sides when unavailable for Liverpool and represented select teams, including a Football Association XI and Scottish Services XI. Liddell was capped eight times for Scotland during the war, scoring on his debut in a 5–4 win over England in 1942.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} a major {{challenge}} for the EU has emerged around social issues and collective identities. With {{the emergence of a}} European political community that has diminished national sovereignty at a time when global forces are also undermining nation states, both Europe and migration become linked as sources of instability. <b>Anxieties</b> <b>about</b> Europe and migration are linked with fears of a clash of civilizations and <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> social securities. Social discontent, fuelled by socio-economic changes, has undermined the traditional sources of identity around class and the nation, releasing xenophobic and nationalistic currents. Fear of others and <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> the future have emerged as potent social forces in contemporary society. The result is a crisis of European solidarity, along with a wider crisis of collective purpose. To combat such developments it is essential that the European project gives greater attention to issues of social justice and inclusive forms of social solidarity...|$|R

Drawing on a psychoanalytic theoretical approach, Faulkner argues that representations of childhood in Australia serve as a screen for more fundamental <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> colonial violence. Likewise, she argues that the removal of Aboriginal children (known as the stolen generations) has been both an effective instrument of colonisation and a symptom for the coloniser's own sense of displacement.|$|R

She argues that by displacing ignorance, political instability and lack of faith onto the Eastern and pagan Chaldean people as represented by Saturn, English people were encouraged to identify with ideals and behaviours of the Christianised figure of Solomon. This is cited as an example of bolstering English Christian culture through degrading the east.|$|R

25|$|The primary {{symptoms}} of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort {{in association with}} frequent diarrhea or constipation and a change in bowel habits.

There may also be urgency for bowel movements, a feeling of incomplete evacuation (tenesmus), bloating, or abdominal distension. In some cases, the symptoms are relieved by bowel movements. People with IBS, more commonly than others, have gastroesophageal reflux, symptoms relating to the genitourinary system, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, headache, backache, and psychiatric symptoms such as depression and <b>anxiety.</b> <b>About</b> a third {{of men and women}} who have IBS also report sexual dysfunction typically in the form of a reduction in libido.|$|E
25|$|It {{is rather}} universally {{accepted}} that {{a body of}} Shakespeare's sonnets, including 65, are addressed {{to a young man}} whose beauty the poems make known. The young man is like Caesar, then, in that Shakespeare recognizes the presence of feminine qualities in a man. But the common theme is more than recognition, it is an acknowledgment of tension created by that recognition. Especially by Cassius, Caesar is made out to be rather feminine, as is the young man in descriptions of his beauty. In that the speaker does not directly refer to the addressee of the sonnets as a man, and in that Brutus and the others find discomfort in Caesar's ruling ability because of his appeared weaknesses, shows that Shakespeare recognizes an <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> men with feminine qualities, or women with masculine qualities, like Queen Elizabeth, of whom Caesar {{may or may not be}} representative.|$|E

40|$|The {{references}} to Poland in United States print culture indicate that Poland {{is a significant}} presence in the nineteenth-century literary imagination. Though often idealized, Poland emerges as a gothic presence registering <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> culture, imperialism, slavery, the Other, economic ruin, and identity. Using Roland Barthes’ theory of cultural code, this dissertation looks to nineteenth-century United States newspapers to consider American readers’ cultural knowledge about Poland. The coded history of revolution beneath each reference to Poland indicates that Polish revolution is the mechanism that reveals American <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> instability, imperialism, class inequalities, and violence—all of which put pressure on America’s mythic history of revolution, freedom, and equality as they’re expressed in literature. In Charles Brockden Brown’s “Somnambulism: A Fragment” (1805), the reference to Silesia and allusion to Poland is code for Poland’s 1794 revolution against partitioning powers Austria, Prussia, and Russia. The allusion registers fears of outside threats to {{the sovereignty of the}} young, vulnerable United States. As code for the major 1830 - 31 revolution against partitioning powers, the Polish character in Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar” (1845) indicates American <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> the nation turning into an imperialistic aggressor similar to the nations that partitioned Poland because of its aggressive actions toward Mexico. For a nation struggling with its own imperialistic tendencies and increasingly quarreling over slavery, {{references to}} Poland in Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick—code for the 1846 Polish revolution—reveal further <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> imperialism and human servitude. In the mid-nineteenth century, when the U. S. struggled with nativist attitudes toward Catholics and immigrants, Polish characters in E. D. E. N. Southworth’s The Missing Bride (1855) and Louisa May Alcott’s “The Baron’s Gloves” (1868) point to Poland’s final nineteenth-century rebellions and betray <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> the threat and/or taint of the Polish Catholic immigrant Other. Finally, in Anthony Walton White Evans’s 1883 biography, Memoir of Thaddeus Kosciuszko, the financially broke and physically broken Thaddeus Kosciuszko, revolutionary hero of both Poland and America, registers concerns about economic ruin and psychological fragmentation that following crashes like that of the Panic of 1873.
