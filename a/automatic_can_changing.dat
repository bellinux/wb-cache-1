5000|$|Kick-down: In E mode, the {{kick-down}} {{function in}} a full <b>automatic</b> <b>can</b> be similarly activated in an MMT car. Additionally, the kick-down function can be manually activated using the - pedal flap {{on the steering wheel}} in E mode. This overrides the computer setting and E changes to E1/E2/E3/E4/E5/E6. To stop the manual override under E mode, pull and hold the + flap on the steering wheel, until the E1/E2/E3/E4/E5/E6 changes back to E. Alternatively, wait for the next computer activated gear change.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the notion of}} event-driven metrics {{as an alternative to}} generating metrics from software project artefacts on-demand or periodically. The rationale for wanting such an alternative stems from on-demand metric updates being prone to human error and for potentially missing important project events and trends. Furthermore, periodic updates, even if they are <b>automatic,</b> <b>can</b> also miss data and, at the other extreme, may even become burdensome if their frequency is too high. We begin by using scenarios to show how the event-driven mechanism might work, and then highlight some of the implementation issues. Finally, we point to the OPHELIA project as a concrete implementation of this notion...|$|R

The preliminary results show that the algorithm is able to achieve a PSNR of approximately 36. 7 and RMSE of approximately 3. 7.
