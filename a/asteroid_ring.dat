It turns out that the Classical KBOSs (CKBOS), which amount to ≈ 70 % of the observed population of Trans-Neptunian bodies, induce a systematic secular error of about 1 m after one year in the transverse direction T of the orbit of a test particle orbiting at 1 AU from the Sun. For Mercury the ratios of the secular perihelion precessions induced by CKBOs to the ones induced by the general relativity and the solar oblateness J 2 amount to 6 × 10 − 7 and 8 × 10 − 4, respectively. The secular transverse perturbation induced on a ≈ 1 AU orbit by the <b>asteroid</b> <b>ring,</b> which globally accounts for the action of the minor asteroids whose mass is about 5 × 10 − 10 solar masses, is 10 m yr − 1; the bias on the relativistic and J 2 Mercury perihelion precessions is 6. 1 × 10 − 6 and 1 × 10 − 2, respectively. Given the very ambitious goals of many expensive and complex missions aimed to testing gravitational theories to unprecedented levels of accuracy, these notes may suggest further and more accurate investigations of such sources of potentially insidious systematic bias...|$|E

40|$|We {{assess the}} ability of a solid ring to model a global {{perturbation}} induced by several thousands of main-belt <b>asteroids.</b> The <b>ring</b> is first studied in an analytical framework that provides an estimate of all the ring's parameters excepting mass. In the second part, numerically estimated perturbations on the Earth-Mars, Earth-Venus, and Earth-Mercury distances induced by various subsets of the main-belt population are compared with perturbations induced by a ring. To account for large uncertainties in the asteroid masses, we obtain results from Monte Carlo experiments based on asteroid masses randomly generated according to available data and the statistical asteroid model. The radius of the ring is analytically estimated at 2. 8 AU. A systematic comparison of the ring with subsets of the main belt shows that, after removing the 300 most perturbing asteroids, the total main-belt perturbation of the Earth-Mars distance reaches on average 246 m on the 1969 - 2010 time interval. A ring with appropriate mass is able to reduce this effect to 38 m. We show that, by removing from the main belt ~ 240 asteroids that are not necessarily the most perturbing ones, the corresponding total perturbation reaches on average 472 m, but the ring is able to reduce it down to a few meters, thus accounting for more than 99 % of the total effect.

30|$|The interplanetary dust {{particle}} (IDP) population reflects a complex balance between sources, transport, and sinks {{which are all}} functions of the {{dust particle}} sizes and their positions in the solar system. IDPs are created primarily in asteroid-asteroid collisions, from the disintegration of comets near the Sun, from collisions between Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), and from the continuous meteoroid bombardment of the moons, <b>rings,</b> <b>asteroids</b> and KBOs. Data from near-Earth and deep space missions suggest five distinct IDP populations (Divine, 1993). While this model makes predictions for IDP populations throughout the solar system, {{it has not been}} validated by direct measurements beyond 18 AU. The Divine (1993) model was used to set the science and measurement requirements for SDC in 2004.

30|$|Most of the {{experiments}} on soliton reflection were conducted in plasmas by neglecting the dust grains which are charged by ions and electrons, and are available in laboratory plasmas or space-related plasmas such as in planetary <b>rings,</b> <b>asteroid</b> zones, cometary tails and in lower parts of Earth’s ionosphere. In addition, low-temperature technological plasmas are also contaminated by highly charged dust impurities. Interestingly, the dust grains may acquire either negative charge or positive charge [24, 25, 26], but the chances are higher that the grains acquire negative charge. In most general situations, the temperature of all the electrons does not remain the same and two groups of electrons with lower and higher temperature {{are found in the}} plasmas [27, 28, 29]. In the two electron temperature plasmas, the characteristics of ion acoustic waves and solitons are modified [27, 28, 29, 30, 31] due to different distributions of these electrons.|$|R
50|$|Because an {{occultation}} {{event for}} an individual object is quite rare, the process of observing occultation events begins {{with the creation of}} a list of candidate targets.

Once a candidate event has been chosen whose ground track passes over the site of an observer, the preparations for the observation begin. A few minutes before the event is expected to happen the observing telescope is targeted to the target star and the star's lightcurve is recorded. The recording of the lightcurve continues during and for a short time after the predicted event. This extra recording time {{is due in part to}} uncertainties in the occulting objects orbit but also due to the possibility of detecting other objects orbiting the primary object (for example in the case of a binary <b>asteroid,</b> also the <b>ring</b> system around the planet Uranus was detected this way).|$|R
40|$|We {{suggest a}} {{generalized}} definition of self-organized criticality (SOC) systems: SOC {{is a critical}} state of a nonlinear energy dissipation system that is slowly and continuously driven towards a critical value of a system-wide instability threshold, producing scale-free, fractal-diffusive, and intermittent avalanches with powerlaw-like size distributions. We develop here a macroscopic description of SOC systems that provides an equivalent description of the complex microscopic fine structure, in terms of fractal-diffusive transport (FD-SOC). Quantitative values for the size distributions of SOC parameters (length scales L, time scales T, waiting times Δ t, fluxes F, and energies E) are derived from first principles, using the scale-free probability conjecture, N(L) dL ∝ L^-d, for Euclidean space dimension d. We apply this model to astrophysical SOC systems, such as lunar craters, the <b>asteroid</b> belt, Saturn <b>ring</b> particles, magnetospheric substorms, radiation belt electrons, solar flares, stellar flares, pulsar glitches, soft gamma-ray repeaters, black-hole objects, blazars, and cosmic rays. The FD-SOC model predicts correctly the size distributions of 8 out of these 12 astrophysical phenomena, and indicates non-standard scaling laws and measurement biases for the others...|$|R

Particle streams interacting with the gas within the Hill sphere of the protoplanet spiral into a prograde circumplanetary disc. Material is accreted on to the protoplanet due to stirring by the turbulent surroundings. We speculate that the trend for prograde rotation among the largest asteroids is primordial and that protoplanets accreted 10 – 50 per cent of their mass from pebbles and rocks during the gaseous solar nebula phase. Our model also offers a possible explanation for the narrow range of spin periods observed among the largest bodies in the asteroid and trans-Neptunian belts, and predicts that 1000 -km-scale Kuiper Belt objects that have not experienced giant impacts should preferentially spin in the prograde direction.

The primary objective of the study is to determine the impact of the Integer Cosine Transform (ICT) compression algorithm on Galilean images of atmospheric bodies, moons, <b>asteroids</b> and Jupiter's <b>rings.</b> The approach involved fifteen volunteer subjects representing twelve institutions involved with the Galileo Solid State Imaging (SSI) experiment. Four different experiment specific quantization tables (q-table) and various compression stepsizes (q-factor) to achieve different compression ratios were used. It then determined the acceptability of the compressed monochromatic astronomical images as evaluated by Galileo SSI mission scientists. Fourteen different images were evaluated. Each observer viewed two versions of the same image side by side on a high resolution monitor, each was compressed using a different quantization stepsize. They were requested to select which image had the highest overall quality to support them in carrying out their visual evaluations of image content. Then they rated both images using a scale from one to five on its judged degree of usefulness. Up to four pre-selected types of images were presented with and without noise to each subject based upon results of a previously administered survey of their image preferences. Fourteen different images in seven image groups were studied. The results showed that: (1) acceptable compression ratios vary widely with the type of images; (2) noisy images detract greatly from image acceptability and acceptable compression ratios; and (3) atmospheric images of Jupiter seem to have higher compression ratios of 4 to 5 times that of some clear surface satellite images...|$|R
40|$|The Lense-Thirring {{precession}} of the longitude of perihelion of Mercury, {{as predicted}} by general relativity {{by using the}} value of the Sun's angular momentum S = 190 x 10 ^ 39 kg m^ 2 s^- 1 from helioseismology, is - 2. 0 milliarcseconds per century, computed in a celestial equatorial reference frame. It disagrees at 4 -σ level with the correction 0. 4 +/- 0. 6 milliarcseconds per century to the standard Newtonian/Einsteinian precession, provided that the latter is to be entirely attributed to frame-dragging. The supplementary precession was recently determined in a global fit with the INPOP 10 a ephemerides to a long planetary data record (1914 - 2010) including also 3 data points collected in 2008 - 2009 from the MESSENGER spacecraft. The INPOP 10 a models did not include the solar gravitomagnetic field at all, so that its signature might have partly been removed in the data reduction process. On the other hand, the Lense-Thirring precession may have been canceled to a certain extent by the competing precessions caused by small mismodeling in the quadrupole mass moment of the Sun and in the PPN parameter beta entering the Schwarzschild-like 1 PN precession, both modeled in INPOP 10 a. On the contrary, the oblateness of Mercury itself has a negligible impact on its perihelion. The same holds for the mismodelled actions of both the largest individual <b>asteroids</b> and the <b>ring</b> of the minor asteroids. Future analysis of more observations from the currently ongoing MESSENGER mission will shed further light on such an issue which, if confirmed, might potentially challenge our present-day picture of the currently accepted laws of gravitation and/or of the physical properties of the Sun.

40|$|Granular {{physics is}} a sub-discipline of physics that {{attempts}} to combine principles {{that have been developed}} for both solid-state physics and engineering (such as soil mechanics) with fluid dynamics in order to formulate a coherent theory for the description of granular materials, which are found in both terrestrial (e. g., earthquakes, landslides, and pharmaceuticals) and extra-terrestrial settings (e. g., asteroids surfaces, asteroid interiors, and planetary ring systems). In the case of our solar system, the growth of this sub-discipline has been key in helping to interpret the formation, structure, and evolution of both <b>asteroids</b> and planetary <b>rings.</b> It is difficult to develop a deterministic theory for granular materials {{due to the fact that}} granular systems are composed of a large number of elements that interact through a non-linear combination of various forces (mechanical, gravitational, and electrostatic, for example) leading to a high degree of stochasticity. Hence, we study these environments using an N-body code, pkdgrav, that is able to simulate the gravitational, collisional, and cohesive interactions of grains. Using pkdgrav, I have studied the size segregation on asteroid surfaces due to seismic shaking (the Brazil-nut effect), the interaction of the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample-return mission sampling head, TAGSAM, with the surface of the asteroid Bennu, the collisional disruptions of rubble-pile asteroids, and the formation of structure in Saturn's rings. In all of these scenarios, I have found that the evolution of a granular system depends sensitively on the intrinsic properties of the individual grains (size, shape, sand surface roughness). For example, through our simulations, we have been able to determine relationships between regolith properties and the amount of surface penetration a spacecraft achieves upon landing. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that this relationship also depends on the strength of the local gravity. By comparing our numerical results to laboratory experiments and observations by spacecraft we can begin to understand which microscopic properties (i. e., grain properties) control the macroscopic properties of the system. For example, we can compare the mechanical response of a spacecraft to landing or Cassini observations of Saturn's ring to understand how the penetration depth of a spacecraft or the complex optical depth structure of a ring system depends on the size and surface properties of the grains in those systems...|$|R
