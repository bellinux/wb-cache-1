5|$|Mathews and {{his troops}} {{also played a}} key role in the ending of the Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896 which erupted out of an attempt to bypass the {{requirement}} that new Sultans must be vetted by the British consul.

5|$|Dunstan saw {{reform of}} the Legislative Council as an {{important}} goal, and later a prime achievement, of his Government. Labor, {{as a matter of}} party policy, wanted to see the Legislative Council abolished. Dunstan, seeing this as unfeasible in his term, set about to reform it instead. Two bills were prepared for Legislative Council reform; one to lower the voting age to 18 and introduce universal suffrage, <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>to</b> make councillors elected from a single statewide electorate under a system of proportional representation. The LCL initially blocked both bills, stating that it would only accept them if modifications were made to the second one. Changes were conceded; unlike the House of Assembly, voting would not be compulsory and the preference system was to be slightly altered. Once the amendments were made, the legislation was passed.|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore {{with a damp}} sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>to</b> load the gun {{with a bag of}} powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.|$|E
5|$|From {{her first}} sight of Florida, Stowe was greatly impressed. In Palmetto Leaves, she sings the praises of Florida in January as a {{beautiful}} land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (Gelsemium sempervirens) <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>to</b> magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things {{to find in the}} woods and what can be made of them. She also keeps a cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) in a cage and four cats, but sadly reports later in the year that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Phœbus the cardinal.|$|E

5|$|He began {{practicing}} law in Romney and was elected Prosecuting Attorney of Hampshire County in 1912. White {{was elected to}} the position four times, and served terms from 1912 to 1928. In addition, he served as the Commissioner of School Lands and as one of the Chancery Commissioners for Hampshire County. White was elected to represent the Fifteenth Senatorial District in the West Virginia Senate in 1930 and served in the senate until 1934. In 1933, White was chairman of the senate's Judiciary Committee and he was also appointed to two special committees: one on economy and efficiency to study state and municipal government spending, <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>to</b> investigate the road commission's awarding of a contract for gasoline, oil, and grease to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey over the Elk Refining Company.|$|E
5|$|In 538/539, Artabanes, at {{the time}} {{apparently}} still a young man, {{took part in the}} Armenian conspiracy against Acacius, the proconsul of First Armenia, whose heavy taxes and cruel behaviour was greatly resented. Artabanes himself killed Acacius. Shortly after, in a skirmish between the rebels and the Byzantine army at Oenochalacon, Artabanes may have killed the Byzantine general Sittas, sent by Justinian to quell the rebellion (Procopius supplies two accounts, one attributing Sittas's death to Artabanes <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>to</b> an otherwise unknown Armenian named Solomon). Artabanes's father tried to negotiate a settlement with Sittas' successor, Bouzes, but was murdered by the latter. This act forced Artabanes and his followers to seek the aid of the Sassanid Persian ruler, Khosrau I (r. 531–579). Crossing over to Persian territory, {{over the next few years}} Artabanes and those who followed him took part in Khosrau's campaigns against the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|In May, the {{battalion}} moved to Balcombe on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria, where they undertook range shoots, planning exercises and bivouacks. In mid-July, the 2/3rd received orders to move north to Cowra by road. Along the way, {{they stopped at}} Ingleburn, New South Wales where a draft of almost 400 reinforcements was received; {{the result of this}} was that in its second incarnation, about half {{the battalion}} came from New South Wales, instead of South Australia. The battalion remained in Cowra, where they carried out training, for ten months, eventually proceeding north to south-east Queensland in May 1943. Based around the Deception Bay area, north of Brisbane, a company was deployed to Moreton Island <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>to</b> Bribie Island. In late June, 'B' Company embarked upon the Dutch vessel, the SS Jansens and deployed to Netherlands New Guinea as part of Merauke Force, remaining there in a defensive capacity until May 1944.|$|E

5|$|Mellitus {{attended}} a council of bishops held in Italy in February 610, convened by Pope Boniface IV. The historian N. J. Higham speculates {{that one reason}} for his attendance may have been to assert the English Church's independence from the Frankish Church. Boniface had Mellitus take two papal letters back to England, one to Æthelbert and his people, <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>to</b> Laurence, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He also brought back the synod's decrees to England. No authentic letters or documents from this synod remain, although some were forged in the 1060s and 1070s at Canterbury. During his time as a bishop, Mellitus joined with Justus, the Bishop of Rochester, in signing a letter that Laurence wrote to the Celtic bishops urging the Celtic Church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter. This letter also mentioned the fact that Irish missionary bishops, such as Dagan, refused to eat with the Roman missionaries.|$|E
5|$|Mose Wright {{stayed on}} his front porch for twenty minutes waiting for Till to return. He did {{not go back to}} bed. He and another man went into Money, got gasoline, and drove around trying to find Till. Unsuccessful, they {{returned}} home by 8:00am. After hearing from Wright that he would not call the police because he feared for his life, Curtis Jones placed a call to the Leflore County sheriff, <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>to</b> his mother in Chicago. Distraught, she called Emmett's mother Mamie Till Bradley. Wright and his wife Elizabeth drove to Sumner, where Elizabeth's brother contacted the sheriff.|$|E
5|$|Remains {{attributed}} to Hypogeomys australis are known from Andrahomana in southeastern Madagascar and Antsirabe in central Madagascar, suggesting a broad former distribution. Its range {{is not known}} to overlap that of H.antimena, which has undergone a dramatic reduction during the Holocene. A bone from Andrahomana has been radiocarbon dated to about 4440 BP <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>to</b> 1536 BP. Although almost nothing is known of the ecology of H.australis, Goodman and Rakotondravony presumed that it was similar to its living relative in living in burrows in areas with loose soils. H.australis shows relatively high content of carbon-13 isotope, likely because it ate some plants which were enriched in carbon-13 through C4 carbon fixation and crassulacean acid metabolism; both of these photosynthesis-related processes occur most frequently in plants adapted to dry environments.|$|E

5|$|Sentiments {{changed with}} the XYZ Affair. Adams {{appointed}} a three-member commission to represent the United States to negotiate with France. The commission consisted of John Marshall, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Elbridge Gerry. However, when the envoys arrived in October 1797, they were kept waiting for several days, and then granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister Talleyrand. After this, the diplomats were met by three of Talleyrand's agents. Each refused to conduct diplomatic negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand personally, <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>to</b> the Republic of France. Supposedly this was {{to make up for}} offenses given to France by Adams in his speech. The Americans refused to negotiate on such terms. Marshall and Pinckney returned home, while Gerry remained.|$|E
5|$|Across its Central Asian distribution, the saxaul sparrow {{occurs in}} six {{probably}} disjunct areas, and {{is divided into}} at least three subspecies. The nominate subspecies Passer ammodendri ammodendri inhabits three of these areas, one in the Syr Darya basin of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>to</b> the south of Lake Balkhash and the north of Almaty, where it is only common in {{the valley of the}} Ili River. In a third area, sometimes recognised as a subspecies korejewi, ammodendri birds breed sporadically in parts of central Turkmenistan, Iran, and possibly Afghanistan, migrating to the south during the winter. The subspecies stoliczkae was named after Ferdinand Stoliczka in 1874 by Allan Octavian Hume, from specimens Stoliczka collected in Yarkand. This subspecies is separated from the other two subspecies by the Tian Shan mountains. It is found across a broad swath of China from Kashgar east to the far west of Inner Mongolia, through the areas around the Taklamakan Desert (but probably not in the inhospitable desert itself), and through the east of Xinjiang, northern Gansu, and the fringes of southern Mongolia. In the extreme west of the Gobi Desert a disjunct population separated from the other stoliczkae birds by the Gurvan Saikhan Uul mountains occurs, which is sometimes separated as a subspecies timidus. The subspecies nigricans, described by ornithologist L. S. Stepanyan in 1961, is found in northern Xinjiang's Manasi River valley.|$|E
5|$|Chetwode {{opened his}} advance XX Corps {{headquarters}} at 17:00 at el Buqqar, and a half-hour later the infantry approach marches began. The 74th (Yeomanry) Division advanced along the Tel el Fara-to-Beersheba road {{led by the}} 229th Brigade, with one brigade following to the north <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>to</b> {{the south of the}} road. The 60th (London) Division advanced from Abu Ghalyun, Bir el Esani and Rashid Bek in three brigade groups, the 181st Brigade (on the left) advanced north and south of the Wadi es Saba, while the 179th Brigade (on the right) advanced towards the Khalasa-to-Beersheba road. Their advance guard, the 2/13th Battalion, London Regiment, was attacked as they crossed the Wadi Halgon. Behind the 179th Brigade, the 180th Brigade in reserve advanced straight across from Esani. The XX Corps Cavalry Regiment, the Westminster Dragoons concentrated to the south-east, covering the corps' right flank with orders to connect with the Desert Mounted Corps south of Beersheba. In the rear, the 53rd (Welsh) Division dug in along the Wadi Hanafish; the XX Corps artillery, the last to move, approached from el Buqqar to the Wadi Abushar, arriving at 03:15 on 31 October. Reconnaissance had established that the Tel el Fara-to-Beersheba track (via Khasif and el Buqqar) could be used by the mechanical transport required to move the heavy gun battery and ammunition into position before the attack. This job was done by 135 lorries in three companies which travelled across the Sinai from Cairo. In addition, ammunition was hauled forward by 134 Holt tractors.|$|E
