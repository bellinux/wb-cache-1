We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> are.|$|E
500|$|The book's fiftieth {{anniversary in}} 2007 {{prompted}} a reevaluation {{of the book}} from some critics. Yvonne Coppard, reviewing the fiftieth anniversary edition in Carousel magazine, wondered if {{the popularity of the}} Cat and his [...] "delicious naughty behavior" [...] will endure another fifty years. Coppard wrote, [...] "The innocent ignorance of bygone days has given way to an all-embracing, almost paranoid awareness of child protection issues. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> have the mysterious stranger who comes in, uninvited, while your mother is out." ...|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the assassins}} {{had belonged to}} the Trujillo regime or had at one point been its staunch supporters, only to find their support for him eroded by the state's crimes against its people. Imbert, one of the assassins, sums up this {{realization}} in a comment prompted by {{the murder of the}} Mirabal sisters: [...] "They kill our fathers, our brothers, our friends. And now they're killing our women. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> sit, resigned, waiting our turn." [...] In an interview, Vargas Llosa describes the corruption and brutality of Trujillo's regime: [...] "He had more or less all the common traits of a Latin American dictator, but pushed to the extreme. In cruelty, I think he went far far away from the restand in corruption, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{learning}} of the revolt, the Viscount of Ouro Preto and the other Cabinet ministers went to Army Headquarters, located at the Field of Santana {{in the heart of}} the capital. The supposedly loyal troops there outnumbered and were better equipped than the rebel force. The adjutant-general (Commander) of the Army, Field Marshal Floriano Peixoto guaranteed his men's loyalty to Ouro Preto, but he was secretly in alliance with the rebels. Floriano and the Minister of the War Rufino Enéias, Viscount of Maracajú (a cousin of Deodoro) ignored repeated orders from Ouro Preto to attack the rebels who were approaching the headquarters. He tried to convince them, recalling the acts of bravery by the Brazilian military in the Paraguayan War. But Floriano replied to him that, [...] "in front of us there were enemies, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> are all Brazilians", which finally brought him to a realization of how far the mutiny had spread among the officer corps.|$|E
500|$|Fired {{partly by}} his mother's stories of joy flights in pre-war Britain, {{and a desire}} to become a flying boat captain for Imperial Airways, Cresswell applied to join the Royal Air Force (RAF) in September 1937. Receiving no answer from the RAF, he applied for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and was accepted. He entered No.1 Flying Training School at Point Cook, Victoria, as an air cadet in July 1938. Over the next twelve months he learnt to fly in Avro Cadet, deHavilland Gipsy Moth and Westland Wapiti trainers, and {{graduated}} as a pilot officer. His first posting was to No.3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron at Richmond, New South Wales, where he began flying Hawker Demon fighters in July 1939. Cresswell recalled a mix of excitement and panic within the squadron when World WarII broke out two months later: [...] "The second night we all slept on the hangar floor next to our aircraft. Imagine it: there was war over in Europe <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> were at action stations!" ...|$|E

He got Adrian Fisher for that, and he involved him {{in all of the}} political and other activities that he himself was involved in. The Secretary of State always is involved in a lot of controversial things, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> had the McCarthy era, the attack on the whole concept of Foreign Service and the State Department, and a terrific controversy over what to do about China, who had [...] "lost China." [...] Fisher was always at Acheson's right hand when he was dealing with other people about these things. Wherever he went, Fisher's office was backstopping him, getting all the necessary background information so he'd be prepared for any kind of question that came up. Of course, Acheson's own approach to being Secretary of State was such that when you took an agreement to him to be signed, his chief question was [...] "By what authority do I sign this?" [...] And whoever brought it to him to get it signed, had to be ready with the answer that would satisfy a lawyer -- [...] "by what legal authority" [...] -- as well as what it provides and so forth.|$|E
500|$|Despite Morello, Wilk and Commerford's {{involvement}} in Prophets of Rage, Commerford confirmed {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone that Rage Against the Machine has not split up, explaining, [...] "We just do things our own way. Throughout our career, we never did what anyone wanted us to do. We never made the records people wanted us to make. We never played by the rules people wanted us to play by. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> are, 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But where are they now? They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm sure will be fantastic—he's a great artist in his own right. But where you're going to hear Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{disaster}} at Sidi Barrani and the withdrawal from Egypt, Lieutenant General Annibale Bergonzoli's XXIII Corps faced the British {{from within the}} strong defences of Bardia. Mussolini wrote to Bergonzoli: [...] "I have given you a difficult task but one suited to your courage and experience as an old and intrepid soldier—the task of defending the fortress of Bardia to the last. I am certain that 'Electric Beard' and his brave soldiers will stand at whatever cost, faithful to the last." [...] Bergonzoli replied: [...] "I am aware of the honour and I have today repeated to my troops your message — simple and unequivocal. In Bardia we are <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> stay." [...] Bergonzoli had approximately 45,000 defenders under his command. The Italian divisions defending the perimeter of Bardia included remnants of four divisions. The northern ("Gerfah") sector was held by the 2nd [...] "28 October" [...] Blackshirt Division; the centre ("Ponticelli") sector by the 1st [...] "23 March" [...] Blackshirt Division and elements of the 62nd [...] "Marmarica" [...] Infantry Division; and the southern ("Mereiga") sector by the 63rd [...] "Cirene" [...] Infantry Division {{and the rest of}} the 62nd [...] "Marmarica" [...] Infantry Division. [...] Bergonzoli also had the remnants of the disbanded 64th [...] "Catanzaro" [...] Infantry Division, some 6,000 Frontier Guard (GaF) troops, three companies of Bersaglieri, part of the dismounted Vittorio Emanuele cavalry regiment, and a machine gun company of the 60th [...] "Sabratha" [...] Infantry Division.|$|E

500|$|PewDiePie {{originally}} registered a YouTube account {{under the}} name [...] "Pewdie"; he explains that [...] "pew" [...] represents the sound of lasers and [...] "die" [...] means death. After forgetting the password to this account, he then registered the [...] "PewDiePie" [...] YouTube channel on 29 April 2010. After {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers, his parents refused to support him, and as a result he funded his early videos by selling prints of his Photoshop art, as well as working at a hot dog stand. On having to work at the stand, PewDiePie stated, [...] "the fact that I could make videos was so much more important to me than [...] I had to spend a few hours a day doing a job that wasn’t that prestigious." [...] Five years later, PewDiePie recalled, [...] "I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn’t know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could just quit college to pursue. It was just something I loved to do. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> are five years later and it’s exploded." [...] By December 2011, PewDiePie's channel had around 60,000 subscribers. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, PewDiePie spoke at Nonick Conference 2012. On 11 July 2012, the channel reached 1 million subscribers, and it reached 2 million subscribers in September. In October, OpenSlate ranked the PewDiePie channel as the #1 YouTube channel. That December, PewDiePie signed with Maker Studios.|$|E

'There are things that nobody had time to do in London, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> have a wonderful opportunity to fix a few things.
