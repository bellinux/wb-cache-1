25|$|Rape {{culture is}} a term used within women's studies and feminism, {{describing}} <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> rape and other sexual violence (usually against women) are common and in which prevalent attitudes, norms, practices, and media condone, normalize, excuse, or encourage sexualized violence.|$|E
25|$|Niece of Caesar, Atia of the Julii is snobbish, willful, cunning, {{and sexually}} voracious. In <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> women lack formal power and men leave {{for years on}} {{military}} campaigns, the wives, daughters, and mothers have built powerful networks and alliances completely independent of the men's worlds. Atia is among the women who serve as the shadow rulers of Rome.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people of}} sub-Saharan Africa choose to foster their {{children}} to infertile women. IVF enables these infertile women {{to have their own}} children, which imposes new ideals to <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> fostering children is seen as both natural and culturally important. Many infertile women are able to earn more respect in their society by taking care of the children of other mothers, and this may be lost if they choose to use IVF instead. As IVF is seen as unnatural, it may even hinder their societal position as opposed to making them equal with fertile women. It is also economically advantageous for infertile women to raise foster children as it gives these children greater ability to access resources that are important for their development and also aids the development of their society at large. If IVF becomes more popular without the birth rate decreasing, there could be more large family homes with fewer options to send their newborn children. This could result in an increase of orphaned children and/or a decrease in resources for the children of large families. This would ultimately stifle the children's and the community's growth.|$|E

500|$|Owen {{suggested}} that the custom's decline was also a result of changing social conditions in South Wales. He argued that the Mari Lwyd wassailing custom [...] "gave an approved means of entering the houses of neighbours in <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> there were few public assemblies [...] {{at least in the}} heart of winter [...] in which the convivial spirit of the season could be released". Further, he {{suggested that}} the gifts of food, drink, and sometimes money [...] "no doubt helped to further the feeling of community among country folk {{while at the same time}} manifesting it". He argued that the changing social conditions altered the ways that people in southern Wales celebrated Christmas, hence contributing to the folk custom's decline.|$|E
500|$|A {{section of}} critics {{wrote on the}} {{relevance}} of the movie to the current times. In an interview, Gatlif stated that he wanted the movie to mirror the current times, adding that the times have not changed much, and that while the political extermination has gone, the psychological and political views of Romani have not. He criticised the French law that allows wanderers to stay in one place only for 24 hours. He was also critical of the plight of Romani in Hungary, Romania and Italy. He went on that the state of the Romani now in many places, [...] "with the rows of homeless people waiting for a bowl of soup with a tin can on their hands", is not very different from that in the concentration camps. Gatlif also lashed out against the fact that until 1969, Romani were required to have their papers stamped at a police station or city hall whenever they arrived at or left a French village. Bob Hill at Moving Pictures Network remarked that the movie draws parallels to the fact that [...] "we are once again veering toward <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> regimes and wealth determine who has the right to live free — and who has no rights at all", and cited present happenings such as the developments in the Middle East, racial wars and inter-country disputes. It added that the movie makes the audience ask themselves if they live in a society that embraces or condemns diversity.|$|E

2500|$|On the Road {{influenced}} {{an entire}} generation of musicians, poets, and writers including Allen Ginsberg. Because of Ginsberg’s friendship with Kerouac, Ginsberg was written into the novel through the character Carlo Marx. Ginsberg recalled that he was attracted to the beat generation, and Kerouac, because the beats valued “detachment from the existing society,” {{while at the same time}} calling for an immediate release from <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the most [...] "freely" [...] accessible items—bodies and ideas—seemed restricted (1). Ginsberg incorporated a sense of freedom of prose and style into his poetry as a result of the influence of Kerouac (1).|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, several U.S. {{government}} officials have criticised WikiLeaks for exposing classified information and claimed that the leaks harm national security and compromise international diplomacy. Several human rights organisations requested with respect to earlier document releases that WikiLeaks adequately redact the names of civilians working with international forces, {{in order to prevent}} repercussions. Some journalists have likewise criticised a perceived lack of editorial discretion when releasing thousands of documents at once and without sufficient analysis. In 2016, Harvard law professor and Electronic Frontier Foundation board member Jonathan Zittrain argued that <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> one constantly risks being [...] "outed" [...] as a result of virtual Watergate-like break-ins (or 4th amendment violations) could lead people to hesitate to speak their minds.|$|E

50|$|Hegemony was {{a concept}} {{previously}} used by Marxists such as Vladimir Ilyich Lenin {{to indicate the}} political leadership of the working-class in a democratic revolution, but developed by Gramsci into an acute analysis {{to explain why the}} 'inevitable' socialist revolution predicted by orthodox Marxism had not occurred by the early 20th century. Capitalism, it seemed, was even more entrenched than ever. Capitalism, Gramsci suggested, maintained control not just through violence and political and economic coercion, but also ideologically, through <b>a</b> hegemonic <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the values of the bourgeoisie became the 'common sense' values of all.

In emotional cultures, people often smile, talk loudly when excited, and greet each other with enthusiasm. So, when people from neutral culture are doing business in an emotional culture they should be ready for a potentially animated and boisterous meeting and should try to respond warmly. As for those from an emotional culture doing business in a neutral culture, they should not be put off by a lack of emotion.|$|E
