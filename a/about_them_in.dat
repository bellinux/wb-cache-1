5|$|Akane and Kogami arrest Makishima but he escapes. Akane is {{disappointed}} when Kogami leaves {{the police force}} to hunt him alone. Akane soon discovers {{that members of the}} Sibyl System, a private organization that manages the Psycho-Pass technology, want to use her to capture Makishima alive. Akane agrees on the condition they rescind their orders to kill the defecting Kogami. Despite her efforts, Akane fails to stop Kogami from killing Makishima. The Sibyl System members allow her to live on condition she does not reveal the truth <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> the epilogue, Akane becomes the de facto leader of Unit One; she is seen briefing a newly recruited Inspector in the finale of season one.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{cooperation}} between the Mongols and their Christian subjects in Antioch, other Christians in the Levant regarded the Mongol approach with unease. Jacques Pantaléon, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, saw the Mongols as a clear threat, and had written to the Pope to warn him <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> 1256. The Franks did, however, send the Dominican David of Ashby {{to the court of}} Hulagu in 1260. In Sidon, Julian Grenier, Lord of Sidon and Beaufort, described by his contemporaries as irresponsible and light-headed, took an opportunity to raid and plunder the area of the Beqaa Valley in Mongol territory. One of the Mongols killed was Kitbuqa's nephew, and in retaliation, Kitbuqa raided the city of Sidon. These events added to the level of distrust between the Mongols and the Crusader forces, whose own center of power was now in the coastal city of Acre.|$|E
5|$|Ramones is {{the debut}} studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones, {{released}} on April 23, 1976 by Sire Records. After Hit Parader editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, she wrote <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> an article and contacted Danny Fields, insisting {{that he be}} their manager. Fields agreed and convinced Craig Leon to produce Ramones, and the band recorded a demo for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president Seymour Stein {{to listen to the}} band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques to those of the Beatles and used advanced production methods by Leon.|$|E

The most important is brain disease and the effects of brain damage, that are covered in the human brain article.|$|E
5|$|When Rand {{first arrived}} in New York as an {{immigrant}} from the Soviet Union in 1926, she was greatly impressed by the Manhattan skyline's towering skyscrapers, which she saw as symbols of freedom, and resolved that she would write <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> 1927, Rand {{was working as a}} junior screenwriter for movie producer Cecil B. DeMille when he asked her to write a script for what would become the 1928 film Skyscraper. The original story by Dudley Murphy was about two construction workers working on a skyscraper who are rivals for a woman's love. Rand rewrote it, transforming the rivals into architects. One of them, Howard Kane, was an idealist dedicated to erecting the skyscraper despite enormous obstacles. The film would have ended with Kane standing atop the completed skyscraper. DeMille rejected Rand's script, and the completed film followed Murphy's original idea. Rand's version contained elements she would use in The Fountainhead.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{large amount}} of {{personal}} information {{is available on the}} web about any individual. S uch information could be used to make vital decisions <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> S o it is important to protect the privacy of individuals when searches <b>about</b> <b>them</b> are executed <b>in</b> the web. Even though some data may be seemingly harmless, they could be potentially abused by other people. The problem is that although people know that searches <b>about</b> <b>them</b> are possible <b>in</b> the web, the do not have any means of controlling the usage of their data on the web by others. If users are given provisions to control how the data <b>about</b> <b>them</b> will be displayed <b>in</b> web searches <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> this problem can be avoided to some extent. In this paper, some of the different techniques for preserving the privacy of an individual at least to a certain extent when searches <b>about</b> <b>them</b> occur <b>in</b> the web are discussed and their performances are compared...|$|R

25|$|German writer Heinrich Smidt {{believed}} that the sea kobolds, or Klabautermann, entered German folklore via German sailors who had learned <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> England. However, historians David Kirby and Merja-Liisa Hinkkanen dispute this, claiming no evidence of such a belief in Britain. An alternate view connects the Klabautermann myths {{with the story of}} Saint Phocas of Sinope. As that story spread from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea. Scholar Reinhard Buss instead sees the Klabautermann as an amalgamation of early and pre-Christian beliefs mixed with new creatures.|$|E

Stradivari's {{influence}} could also be seen in Spain with the outstanding work of José Contreras of Granada and Madrid. Having the privilege to be exposed to Stradivari's instruments through the Spanish court, he was experienced enough to replace the scroll of a 1717 Stradivari cello and possibly even make its back and ribs. He had a great ability to imitate the original varnish and intricacy of the instrument.|$|E
25|$|If the {{hypothesis}} is true, then the Chinese probably knew about differentials centuries before Europeans.

The first true differential gear definitely {{known to have been}} used in the Western world was by Joseph Williamson in 1720. He used a differential for correcting the equation of time for a clock that displayed both mean and solar time. Even then, the differential was not fully appreciated in Europe until James White emphasized its importance and provided details for it in his Century of Inventions (1822).|$|E
25|$|After Abu Sa'id's {{death in}} 1335, the Ilkhanate began to {{disintegrate}} rapidly and split up into several rival successor states, most prominently the Jalayirids. Hasar's descendant Togha Temür, {{who was the}} last of the obscure Ilkhan pretenders, was assassinated by Sarbadars in 1353. Timur later carved a state from the Jalayirids, ostensibly to restore the old khanate. Historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani wrote a universal history of the khans around 1315 that provides much material <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> 1357, the Golden Horde conquered the Chobanid-held Tabriz for a year, putting an end to the last hope for the return of the Ilkhanate. After the demise of the Ilkhanate, the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia lost Mongol protection against the Mamluks and was destroyed by them in 1375.|$|E
