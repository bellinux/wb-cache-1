5|$|In late 1857, Bologna's inquisitor Father Pier Feletti {{heard that}} Anna Morisi, {{who had worked}} in the Mortara house for six years, had {{secretly}} baptised Edgardo when she had thought he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> as a baby. The Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition held that this made the child irrevocably a Catholic and, because the Papal States forbade the raising of Christians by members of other faiths, ordered that he be taken from his family and brought up by the Church. Police came to the Mortara home late on 23 June 1858 and removed Edgardo the following evening.|$|E

Mulder realizes that Harold met each of the murdered women at the bowling alley. Harold lapses into a strange seizure, and from his point of view, sees Angie's ghost standing behind Mulder. He rushes {{out of the room and}} makes his way to the bowling alley, where Angie lies dead from a heart attack. Mulder tells Scully that every person who saw the apparitions was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> implying that Harold may be next. Scully, who also saw a victim's ghost, is struck by the implication.|$|E

Accepting that he's <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> he decides to leave rather than let his family see him endure a slow, painful death. He makes a tearful farewell {{to his family and}} friends and rides off on his motorbike. In April 2004, Martin receives a telephone call from Mark's nurse, informing him that Mark has died of the AIDS-related illness, Non-Hodgkins lymphoma. His body is returned to Walford and he is given a heart-felt send-off by the residents.|$|E
25|$|When Mar Ukba was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> {{he asked}} to see his charity accounts. Finding gifts worth 7,000 Sijan gold denarii {{recorded}} therein, he exclaimed that the provisions were scanty and the road was long, and he forthwith distributed half of his wealth to charity. The Gemara asked how Mar Ukba could have given away so much, when Rabbi Elai taught that when the Sanhedrin sat at Usha, it ordained that if a person wishes to give liberally the person should not give more than {{a fifth of the}} person's wealth. The Gemara explained that this limitation applies only during a person's lifetime, as the person might thereby be impoverished, but the limitation does not apply to gifts at death.|$|E

30|$|The Australian federal {{government}} has taken cover-up to another level by passing a law against giving information, through electronic means, <b>about</b> how <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> That means that a website giving information about obtaining the lethal drug Nembutal {{and how much to}} take for a peaceful death is illegal. It is also illegal to offer this sort of information over the telephone. This law is aimed at the organisation Exit International, which specialises in offering end-of-life information. Philip Nitschke, the director of Exit, and his partner Fiona Stewart wrote a book, The Peaceful Pill Handbook, giving detailed information <b>about</b> various ways <b>to</b> <b>die</b> (Nitschke and Stewart 2006).

25|$|Dispersal {{creates a}} {{relatively}} high mortality rate for sugarbeet root aphids. Additionally, alate aphids incur other disadvantages: if aphids fly then they may incur an additional cost in that their potential fecundity is further reduced {{and there is a}} further delay in the onset of reproduction. The combined effect is a marked reduction in reproductive potential and rate of increase. Although dispersal results in the colonization of suitable plants, it is not always clear what advantages there are in dispersing except from annual plants that are <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> As dispersal can be costly in terms of fecundity or survival, or both, then sugarbeet root aphids are likely to delay departure until host quality falls below the average expectation for the habitat.|$|E
25|$|Quaisoir {{meanwhile}} flees {{from the}} palace {{in search of}} Athanasius but instead is encountered {{by a group of}} rebels who attack her, blinding her by stabbing her in the eyes. Dowd and Judith, who had been having more visions of her, soon arrive and all the rebels are either killed or flee. Quaisoir at first thinks Dowd is her lord but when Judith spoils the illusion by talking, Dowd tries to kill her. Judith flees as Dowd attacks Quaisoir instead and ends up near a large well. Dowd catches up to her and is about to kill her by throwing her in there. <b>About</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> Judith has visions of her origin, she was created as a replica of Quaisoir hundreds of years before. Quaisoir, amazingly still alive arrives and using her power saves Judith and lets Dowd fall in the well after he reveals that hundreds of years before he found a woman for Hapexamendios, Celestine, who bore him a child.|$|E
25|$|The most noted of the palace's ghosts is the Vita frun (the White lady). A White Lady, White woman, Weiße Frau or Dame Blanche is said {{to exist}} in many European castles and {{likewise}} in Stockholm. According to legend, the White Lady is a messenger of death for someone in the Royal Family. She showed up when someone was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> She is supposedly tall and wears a white silk dress, only the rustle of the silk is heard as she approaches. There are several theories as to who she might be and where she comes from. According to one theory she is the Duchess Agnes of Merán, a German noble lady from the House of Hohenzollern {{who lived in the}} 1200s. She was married to Count Otto of Orlamünde until he died in 1293. She murdered both her children by him to be able to marry Albrect, a Count from Nurnberg also known as The Fair, but he abandoned her. She died in prison and is since then showing herself as a white lady in the Hohenzollern castles in connection to important family events.|$|E

The boys hide, and Will's father spots them hiding under a storm drain in front of the cigar store. The boys convince him to keep quiet. Mr. Dark later arrives to talk to him. Mr. Holloway pretends not to know the two boys whose faces are tattooed on the man's hand, but when the Witch comes and begins to sense the boys' presence he blows cigar smoke at her- choking her and forcing her to leave. Mr. Dark then asks Charles Holloway for his name, and Will's father tells him he is the town library's janitor. That night Will and Jim meet him at the library where he has done research into his own father's ministerial notes. The carnival arrives once a generation, and leaves {{in the midst of a}} giant storm. Mr. Dark appears and the boys hide in the book stacks. He discovers both of them and crushes the janitor's hand when Mr. Holloway attempts to fight him. The tarot witch casts spells on the boys to mesmerize them and also tries to stop Mr. Holloway's heart. Just before he is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> Charles Holloway looks at the Witch and begins to laugh hysterically. His laughter wounds her deeply and drives her away.

Chad later strikes up a romance with Abigail Deveraux despite his new family's disapproval. Chad briefly moves into the mansion until he is shot in August 2011 and moves out for his own good. Chad then falls for Abigail's best friend Melanie Jonas after they share a kiss at the town's Halloween party. Meanwhile, Chad, Will and Sonny Kiriakis launch an internet website for sport fans at Salem University.

The criminals then kidnap Chad and Melanie and believing they are <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> the two confess their feelings. Fortunately, they are rescued; however, Chad and Abigail break up. Abigail is initially upset about Chad and Melanie's romance, but she later gives them her blessing. Meanwhile, Chad and Gabi (Camila Banus) are forced to work together when they are both hired as models for Countess Wilhelmina. When Billie Reed (Lisa Rinna) mistakenly assumes they are dating, Gabi begins scheming to win Chad's affections. Melanie is uncomfortable with the attention Chad and Gabi are getting for their modeling campaign and their chemistry, but Chad assures her that he only has eyes for her.
