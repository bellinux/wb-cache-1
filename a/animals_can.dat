5|$|<b>Animals</b> <b>can</b> appear {{coloured}} due to two mechanisms, pigments {{and structural}} colours. Animals may have both biological pigments and structural colours, for example, some butterflies.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{account of}} {{metabolism}} sought {{to explain how}} food was processed by the body to provide both heat and the materials for the body's construction and maintenance. The metabolic system for live-bearing tetrapods described in the Parts of <b>Animals</b> <b>can</b> be modelled as an open system, a branching tree of flows of material through the body.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{crocodilians}} are stalk-and-ambush predators, though hunting strategies {{vary depending}} on the individual species and the prey being hunted. Terrestrial prey is stalked from the water's edge and then grabbed and drowned. Gharials and other fish-eating species sweep their jaws sideways to snap up prey, and these <b>animals</b> <b>can</b> leap out of the water to catch birds, bats, and leaping fish. Small <b>animals</b> <b>can</b> be killed by whiplash as the predator shakes its head. Caimans use their tails and bodies to herd fish into shallow water. They may also dig for bottom-dwelling invertebrates, and the smooth-fronted caiman will even hunt on land. Some crocodilian species have been observed to use sticks and branches to lure nest-building birds. Nile crocodiles are known to hunt cooperatively, and several individuals may feed on the same carcass. Most species will eat anything suitable that comes within reach and are also opportunistic scavengers.|$|E
50|$|The vacuum {{formed by}} the {{presence}} of the ball bearing keeps water from flowing out of the bottle. An <b>animal</b> <b>can</b> interrupt this vacuum by pressing against the ball bearing and forcing it slightly up the tubeâ€”thus an <b>animal</b> <b>can</b> drink from the bottle by licking the metal ball bearing.|$|R
50|$|The {{conditioned}} place preference protocol {{makes use}} of an apparatus that contains two or more compartments or areas. These two compartments are designed so that the <b>animal</b> <b>can</b> discriminate between them. Differently patterned walls or floors or different types of floor texture {{may be used to}} ensure the <b>animal</b> <b>can</b> discriminate between the compartments.|$|R
5000|$|The stay {{apparatus}} is {{an arrangement}} of muscles, tendons and ligaments that work together so that an <b>animal</b> <b>can</b> remain standing with [...] "virtually no" [...] muscular effort. [...] The effect is that an <b>animal</b> <b>can</b> distribute its weight on three limbs while resting a fourth in a flexed, non-weight bearing position. The <b>animal</b> <b>can</b> periodically shift its weight to rest a different leg and thus all limbs are able to be individually rested, reducing overall wear and tear. The relatively slim legs of certain large mammals such as horses and cows {{would be subject to}} dangerous levels of fatigue if not for the stay apparatus.|$|R
5|$|Many <b>animals</b> <b>can</b> learn {{behaviours}} by imitation, but ants may be {{the only}} group apart from mammals where interactive teaching has been observed. A knowledgeable forager of Temnothorax albipennis will lead a naive nest-mate to newly discovered food by the process of tandem running. The follower obtains knowledge through its leading tutor. The leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lags and speeds up when the follower gets too close.|$|E
5|$|Many {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed for animal navigation: there is evidence {{for a number of}} them. Investigators have often been forced to discard the simplest hypotheses - for example, some <b>animals</b> <b>can</b> navigate on a dark and cloudy night, when neither landmarks nor celestial cues like sun, moon, or stars are visible. The major mechanisms known or hypothesized are described in turn below.|$|E
5|$|Miri Crocodile Farm cum Mini Zoo {{is located}} near the Baram Delta. It houses 1,000 estuarine {{crocodiles}} including Malayan gharial crocodiles. Man-made sanctuary pools are also constructed for the crocodiles. Other <b>animals</b> <b>can</b> also be found here such as cassowary, sun bears, python, monkeys and porcupines. Visitors are allowed to feed the animals with bananas available from the canteen.|$|E

5|$|Some <b>animals</b> <b>can</b> {{navigate}} using celestial cues such as {{the position}} of the sun. Since the sun moves in the sky, navigation by this means also requires an internal clock. Many animals depend on such a clock to maintain their circadian rhythm. Animals that use sun compass orientation are fish, birds, sea-turtles, butterflies, bees, sandhoppers, reptiles, and ants.|$|E
5|$|Some prey {{species are}} capable of {{fighting}} back against predators, whether with chemicals, through communal defence, or by ejecting noxious materials. Many <b>animals</b> <b>can</b> escape by fleeing rapidly, outrunning or outmanoeuvring their attacker. Finally, some species are able to escape even when caught by sacrificing certain body parts: crabs can shed a claw, while lizards can shed their tails, often distracting predators long enough to permit the prey to escape.|$|E
5|$|Surnames that mention <b>animals</b> <b>can</b> also be toponymic, {{the names}} Horscroft, Horsfall, Horsley and Horstead for example all {{denoting}} {{people who came}} from these villages associated with horses. The surname Horseman (1226 onwards) {{on the other hand}} is a metonym for a rider, mounted warrior, or horse-dealer, while the surnames Horse and Horsnail could either be nicknames or metonyms for workers with horses and shoers of horses respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} Tarrare's {{behaviour}} is not known. While {{there are other}} documented cases of similar behaviour from the period, none of the subjects other than Tarrare were autopsied {{and there have been}} no modern documented cases resembling Tarrare. Hyperthyroidism can induce an extreme appetite, rapid weight loss, profuse sweating, heat intolerance, and fine hair. Bondeson (2006) speculates that Tarrare suffered from a damaged amygdala; it is known that injuries to the amygdala in <b>animals</b> <b>can</b> induce polyphagia.|$|E

5|$|While the jaguar {{closely resembles}} the leopard, it is {{sturdier}} and heavier, {{and the two}} <b>animals</b> <b>can</b> be distinguished by their rosettes: the rosettes on a jaguar's coat are larger, fewer in number, usually darker, and have thicker lines and small spots in the middle that the leopard lacks. Jaguars also have rounder heads and shorter, stockier limbs compared to leopards.|$|E

5|$|A {{nest box}} {{can also be}} {{regarded}} as an animal surveillance device. Surveilling <b>animals</b> <b>can</b> lead {{to the discovery of}} new scientific and industrial fields. For example, biologists and engineers can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe an animal. While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E
5|$|Because game <b>animals</b> <b>can</b> be shot using lead bullets, the {{potential}} for lead ingestion from game meat consumption has been studied clinically and epidemiologically. In a recent {{study conducted by the}} CDC, a cohort from North Dakota was enrolled and asked to self-report historical consumption of game meat, and participation in other activities that could cause lead exposure. The study found that participants' age, sex, housing age, current hobbies with potential for lead exposure, and game consumption were all associated with blood lead level (PbB).|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{down the}} line, the train passes the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad mine train roller coaster {{attraction}} and traverses a swing bridge, which crosses a canal {{that connects the}} Rivers of America to a boat servicing area. This bridge was originally located in Wabasso, Florida, and was previously owned by the Florida East Coast Railway. The train then runs through an area where numerous static and Audio-Animatronic displays of Native Americans and wild <b>animals</b> <b>can</b> be seen. After that, the train goes under an overpass, passes the spur line leading to the WDWRR's roundhouse where its trains are stored and maintained, and arrives at its next stop at Fantasyland Station.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its initial}} plausibility, the {{identity}} theory faces a strong {{challenge in the}} form of the thesis of multiple realizability, first formulated by Hilary Putnam. It is obvious that not only humans, but many different species of <b>animals</b> <b>can,</b> for example, experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.|$|E
5|$|In Albanian folklore, the dhampir is {{the hybrid}} {{child of the}} karkanxholl (a werewolf-like {{creature}} with an iron mail shirt) or the lugat (a water-dwelling ghost or monster). The dhampir sprung of a karkanxholl has the unique ability to discern the karkanxholl; from this derives the expression the dhampir knows the lugat. The lugat cannot be seen, he can only be killed by the dhampir, who himself is usually {{the son of a}} lugat. In different regions, <b>animals</b> <b>can</b> be revenants as lugats; also, living people during their sleep. Dhampiraj is also an Albanian surname.|$|E
5|$|Players of Donkey Kong Country control {{one of two}} {{characters}}: Donkey Kong or {{his nephew}} Diddy. The player can switch between characters if they are both on the screen. Donkey is {{the larger of the}} two, and can defeat enemies more easily while Diddy is faster and more agile. In several levels, players can gain assistance from various animals, who are found by breaking open crates. These helpers include Rambi the Rhino, Expresso the Ostrich, Enguarde the Swordfish, Winky the Frog, and Squawks the Parrot. Each animal can be found in an appropriately themed level: for example, Enguarde can only be found underwater, and Squawks is found in one cave level. Some <b>animals</b> <b>can</b> also give players access to bonus games.|$|E
