There was one clear path through the hills, which was especially well defended. Commandant Chaltin brought forward five companies for the attack, leaving his remaining three in reserve.|$|E

500|$|On January 25, 1865 the Shenandoah made harbor at Williamstown, Victoria, near Melbourne, {{in order}} to repair damage {{received}} while capturing Union whaling-ships. <b>At</b> <b>seven</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the evening, Waddell sent Lieutenant Grimball to gain approval from local authorities to repair their ship,; Grimball returned three hours later saying they were granted permission. [...] The United States consul, William Blanchard, insisted that the Victorian government arrest the Confederates as pirates, but Victoria's governor, Sir Charles Henry Darling, ignored his pleas, satisfied with the Shenandoah’s pleading of neutrality when requesting {{to be allowed to}} undertake repairs. [...] Aside from a few fist fights between Americans, there was no direct conflict between the two warring sides in Melbourne. [...] However, there were eighteen desertions while ashore, and there were constant threats of Northern sympathisers joining the crew {{in order to}} capture the ship when it was at sea.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Paul {{established}} the [...] "Ron Paul Channel", an Internet broadcast. Its slogan is [...] "Turn Off Your TV. Turn On the Truth." [...] Speaking about the channel, Paul said, [...] "I {{was at a}} debate one time a couple years ago, where I didn't think I got a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. I thought, maybe there's {{something wrong with the}} media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there’s a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media." [...] Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, [...] "They don’t sit and watch TV and turn the programs on <b>at</b> <b>seven</b> <b>o'clock</b> to watch us like that – so I thought the technology was there. The country is ripe for the continuation of this revolution." ...|$|E
500|$|Without a map, {{the route}} they chose was largely conjectural. By dawn they had ascended to [...] {{and could see}} the {{northern}} coast. They were above Possession Bay, which meant {{they would need to}} move eastward to reach their intended destination of Stromness. This meant the first of several backtrackings that would extend the journey and frustrate the men. At the close of that first day, needing to descend to the valley below them before nightfall, they risked everything by sliding down a mountainside on a makeshift rope sledge. There was no question of rest—they travelled on by moonlight, moving upwards towards a gap in the next mountainous ridge. [...] Early next morning, 20 May, seeing Husvik Harbour below them, they knew that they were on the right path. <b>At</b> <b>seven</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning they heard the steam whistle sound from Stromness, [...] "the first sound created by an outside human agency that had come to our ears since we left Stromness Bay in December 1914". After a difficult descent, which involved passage down through a freezing waterfall, they at last reached safety.|$|E

The pedal-driven bicycle was now established and 325 riders had entered for the 83-mile race to Rouen. The organisers were scared of starting them all together, so split the field into two groups – a little girl of five made the draw. My father was the race favourite; second favourite was Castéra, who was second at St Cloud; third favourite was an English visitor, a student from Cambridge named Johnson, who had won races at home.

2500|$|V-J Day in Times Square (also V-Day and The Kiss) is a {{photograph}} by Alfred Eisenstaedt that portrays a U.S. Navy sailor grabbing and kissing a stranger—a woman in a white dress—on Victory over Japan Day ("V-J Day") in New York City's Times Square on August 14, 1945. The photograph was published a week later in Life magazine, among many photographs of celebrations around the United States that were presented in a twelve-page section titled [...] "Victory Celebrations". A two-page spread faces three other kissing poses among celebrators in Washington, D.C.; Kansas City; and Miami opposite Eisenstaedt's, which was given a full-page display. Kissing was a favorite pose encouraged by medi{{a photograph}}ers of service personnel during the war, but Eisenstaedt was photographing a spontaneous event that occurred in Times Square soon before {{the announcement of the}} end of the war with Japan was made by U.S. President Harry S. Truman <b>at</b> <b>seven</b> <b>o'clock.</b> Similar jubilation spread quickly with the news.|$|E
2500|$|On February 16, 1804, <b>at</b> <b>seven</b> <b>o'clock</b> in {{the evening}} under {{the dim light of}} a waxing {{crescent}} moon, Intrepid slowly sailed into Tripoli harbor. Decatur's vessel was made to look like a common merchant ship from Malta and was outfitted with [...] To further avoid suspicion, on board were five Sicilian volunteers including the pilot Salvador Catalano, who spoke Arabic. The boarding party remained hidden below in position, prepared to board the captured Philadelphia. The men were divided into several groups, each assigned to secure given areas of the ship, with the additional explicit instruction of refraining from the use of firearms unless it proved absolutely necessary. As Decatur's ship came closer to Philadelphia, Catalano called out to the harbor personnel in Arabic that their ship had lost its anchors during a recent storm and was seeking refuge at Tripoli for repairs. By 9:30p.m. Decatur's ship was within 200 yards of Philadelphia, whose lower yards were now resting on the deck with her foremast missing, as Bainbridge had ordered it cut away and had also jettisoned some of her guns in a futile effort to refloat the ship by lightening her load.|$|E

2500|$|Gage, being thus left {{to his own}} resources, held {{a council}} of war, and <b>at</b> <b>seven</b> <b>o'clock,</b> after a desperate struggle, gained the summit of Cowdery's Down, and, {{notwithstanding}} the exhausted condition of his troops, cut {{his way through the}} lines of the beleaguering forces. In his efforts he was ably assisted by the garrison, who made a vigorous sally, and being thus attacked in front and rear, the Parliamentarians soon left the way clear, and Gage made a triumphant entry into the House, carrying with him a large quantity of ammunition. The attacking forces, being thrown into great disorder, retired to some distance to re-organize themselves, and the opportunity was seized by Gage to collect food and forage {{for the use of the}} garrison. The provisions being brought in, a sally was made by 100 musketeers under the command of Major Cufaude and Captain Hall, and the enemy's works upon the Basing side were carried, including the church, the garrison of which were made prisoners, and consisted of captains John Jephson and Jarvis, one lieutenant, two sergeants, and 30 soldiers. The quarters of the Roundheads were that night set alight in three places, [...] "the enemy so hastening from these works as scarcely three could be made to stay the killing".|$|E
2500|$|In December 1978, the EGP group leader, Ramon, was {{captured}} by soldiers of the military detachment in El Estor and transferred to the military zone of Puerto Barrios; after two years returned to El Estor; but this time as {{an officer in the}} Army G2 and joined a group of soldiers that came to the village. On the evening of 28 September 1981, an army officer accompanied by four soldiers and a military commissioner met with about thirty civilians. <b>At</b> <b>seven</b> <b>o'clock,</b> over thirty civilians, mostly from [...] "Nueva Esperanza', including several 'informants' known to military intelligence, gathered around La Llorona along with some military commissioners and a small group of soldiers and army officers. Then they entered the village. Civilians and commissioners entered twelve houses, and each of them were pulling men and shot them dead outside their own homes; those who tried to escape were also killed. Women who tried to protect their husbands were beaten. While the military commissioners and civilians executed men, soldiers subtracted belongings of the victims; within half an hour, the authors of the assault left the village. The victim bodies, fourteen in all, were in front of houses. Women, despite having been threatened with death if telling what had happened, ran to the nearest village, El Bongo, for help. After a few hours, women came back with people who helped to bury the bodies. Days later, widows, with almost 60 fatherless children were welcomed by the parish of El Estor for several days, until the soldiers forced them to return to their village. Two widows of those executed on 29 September established close relations with the military commissioners from Bongo. This situation led to divisions that still exist in the community.|$|E
2500|$|<b>At</b> <b>seven</b> <b>o'clock</b> on {{the morning}} of 29 August work on the hull was carried out and Royal George was heeled over by rolling the ship's {{starboard}} guns into the centreline of the ship. This caused the ship to tilt over in the water to port. [...] Further, the loading {{of a large number of}} casks of rum on the now-low port side created additional and, it turned out, unstable weight. The ship was heeled over too far, passing her centre of gravity. Realising that the ship was settling in the water, the ship's carpenter informed the lieutenant of the watch, Monin Hollingbery, and asked him to beat the drum to signal to the men to right the ship. [...] The officer refused. [...] As the situation worsened, the carpenter implored the officer a second time. [...] A second time he was refused. [...] The carpenter then took his concern directly to the ship's captain, who agreed with him and gave the order to move the guns back into position. [...] By this time, however, the ship had already taken on too much water through its port-side gun ports, and the drum was never sounded. [...] The ship tilted heavily to port, causing a sudden inrush of water and a burst of air out the starboard side. The barge along the port side which had been unloading the rum was caught in the masts as the ship turned, briefly delaying the sinking, but losing most of her crew. Royal George quickly filled up with water and sank, taking with her around 900 people, including up to 300 women and 60 children who were visiting the ship in harbour. 255 people were saved, including eleven women and one child. Some escaped by running up the rigging, while others were picked up by boats from other vessels. Kempenfelt was writing in his cabin when the ship sank; the cabin doors had jammed because of the ship's heeling and he perished. Waghorn was injured and thrown into the water, but he was rescued. [...] The carpenter survived the sinking, but died less than a day later, never having regained consciousness. Hollingbery also survived.|$|E
