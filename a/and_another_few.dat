60|$|This {{happened}} on a Saturday morning, {{and on that}} afternoon Roger Carbury rode over to Lowestoft, to a meeting there on church matters at which his friend the bishop presided. After the meeting was over he dined at the inn with half a dozen clergymen {{and two or three}} neighbouring gentlemen, and then walked down by himself on to the long strand which has made Lowestoft what it is. It was now just the end of June, and the weather was delightful;--but people were not as yet flocking to the sea-shore. Every shopkeeper in every little town through the country now follows the fashion set by Parliament and abstains from his annual holiday till August or September. The place therefore was by no means full. Here and there a few of the townspeople, who at a bathing place are generally indifferent to the sea, were strolling about; <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>few,</b> indifferent to fashion, had come out from the lodging-houses and from the hotel, which had been described as being small and insignificant,--and making up only a hundred beds. Roger Carbury, whose house was not many miles distant from Lowestoft, was fond of the sea-shore, and always came to loiter there for a while when any cause brought him into the town. Now he was walking close down upon the marge of the tide,--so that the last little roll of the rising water should touch his feet,--with his hands joined behind his back, and his face turned down towards the shore, when he came upon a couple who were standing with their backs to the land, looking forth together upon the waves. He was close to them before he saw them, and before they had seen him. Then he perceived that the man was his friend Paul Montague. Leaning on Paul's arm a lady stood, dressed very simply in black, with a dark straw hat on her head;-- very simple in her attire, but yet a woman whom {{it would be impossible to}} pass without notice. The lady of course was Mrs Hurtle.|$|E

40|$|Referees' and editors' {{behavior}} {{is illustrated by}} data from {{a random sample of}} refereeing requests by seven economics journals. Referees tend to be higher-quality (better-cited, prime-age) than authors. Except for a few superstar authors, there is no matching of authors and referees by quality. Nearly 80 percent of those asked to referee do so, with a median completion time of less than two months. Except for a few very slow referees <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>few</b> who promise but fail to accomplish the task, the slow editorial process is not due to referees' behavior.

40|$|Language is {{a vehicle}} of {{intangible}} heritage and transmits many {{social and cultural}} concepts from generation to generation. Half of the world's languages, including most of the Altaic languages, are now in danger of extinction. The loss of a language means the loss of cultural and intellectual diversity. This paper describes a linguistic project which aims to preserve the endangered Altaic languages. The ASK REAL (Altaic Society of Korea, Researches on Endangered Altaic Languages) team has gathered linguistic resources from thirty-eight Altaic languages and plans to build an extensive digital archive of all fifty-five of them. Through field research in minority language communities spread over a vast area of Eurasia, we acquired nearly three thousand lexical items of multimediadata, a few hundred grammatical constructions <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>few</b> hundred examples of daily conversation for each language.

40|$|Worldwide, {{increasing}} demand for drinking water {{to cater to}} the increasing urban population {{has led to the}} use of lakes and reservoirs with unprotected catchments as sources of public water supplies. These water bodies receive drainage water containing large amount of nutrients, mostly from intensive agricultural practices, resulting in algal blooms, which have become a growing environmental problem. Conventional treatment used for surface water may not always produce satisfactory quality water in these situations. In addition, the increasing occurrence of toxins produced by cyanobacteria in such water bodies has become an important public health issue. “Eastern Coastal Towns of Ampara District (ECTAD) Water Supply Project”, where the raw water source is an irrigation tank with high inflows of nutrients was used as a case study. Coagulation, flocculation, dissolved air floatation (DAF), rapid gravity filtration and disinfection are the unit operations that have been designed and constructed, while Pre-chlorination and Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) adsorption are also currently used in this water treatment plant, which have been introduced to treat taste an odour problems encountered after commissioning the plant. The case study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of pre-chlorination, activated carbon adsorption, Dissolved Air Flotation, filtration and disinfection in removal of cyanotoxins, taste and odor causing dissolved organic substances and colour causing substances such as iron and manganese from the source water, in order to provide satisfactory potable water. The samples were collected at the source, and the inlet and outlets of each unit operations. Samples were collected in the morning and afternoon to capture the diurnal variations in quality. It was decided to carry out four trials during two dry seasons and two wet seasons since the raw water quality reports showed that the quality was significantly varied seasonally. It was found from this study that raw water in Konduwatuwana Tank has high cyanobacteria content and Microcystis aeruginosa is the predominant specie. Main findings of our study were that PAC was effective in removal of Microcystin as well as dissolved organic substances, but needs to be optimized by providing sufficient contact time, and pre-chlorination does not improve the performance. The results of this study were generalized using water quality data of irrigation tanks in Gal oya cascade system, several irrigation tanks in the Kala Oya Basin <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>few</b> selected irrigation tanks in the North Central Province (not in the Kala Oya Basin) ...|$|E

40|$|The top quark, when it {{was finally}} {{discovered}} at Fermilab in 1995 completed the three-generation structure of the Standard Model (SM) and opened up the new field of top quark physics. Viewed as just another SM quark, the top quark {{appears to be a}} rather uninteresting species. Produced predominantly, in hadron-hadron collisions, through strong interactions, it decays rapidly without forming hadrons, and almost exclusively through the single mode t {r_arrow} Wb. The relevant CKM coupling V{sub tb} is already determined by the (three-generation) unitarity of the CKM matrix. Rare decays and CP violation are unmeasurable small in the SM. Yet the top quark is distinguished by its large mass, about 35 times larger than the mass of the next heavy quark, and intriguingly close to the scale of electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking. This unique property raises a number of interesting questions. Is the top quark mass generated by the Higgs mechanism as the SM predicts and is its mass related to the top-Higgs-Yukawa coupling? Or does it play an even more fundamental role in the EW symmetry breaking mechanism? If there are new particles lighter than the top quark, does the top quark decay into them? Could non-SM physics first manifest itself in non-standard couplings of the top quark which show up as anomalies in top quark production and decays? Top quark physics tries to answer these questions. Several properties of the top quark have already been examined at the Tevatron. These include studies of the kinematical properties of top production, the measurements of the top mass, of the top production cross-section, the reconstruction of t{bar t}pairs in the fully hadronic final states, the study of {tau} decays of the top quark, the reconstruction of hadronic decays of the W boson from top decays, the search for flavor changing neutral current decays, the measurement of the W helicity in top decays, and bounds on t{bar t} spin correlations. Most of these measurements are limited by the small sample of top quarks collected at the Tevatron up to now. The LHC is, in comparison, a top factory, producing about 8 million t{bar t}pairs per experiment per year at low luminosity (10 fb{sup {minus} 1 }/year), <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>few</b> million (anti-) tops in EW single (anti-) top quark production. They therefore expect that top quark properties can be examined with significant precision at the LHC. Entirely new measurements can be contemplated {{on the basis of the}} large available statistics...|$|E
