The Windows version of Internet Explorer 5 had been released a year earlier, but used the Trident layout engine. The Macintosh Edition introduced a new rendering engine called Tasman that was designed to be more compliant with emerging W3C standards such as HTML 4.0, CSS Level 1, DOM Level 1, and ECMAScript. It also introduced a number of features that were later added to other browsers such as complete support for the PNG image standard (which previous versions did not support at all), DOCTYPE switching, Text Zoom and XML source view. It also included an <b>Auction</b> <b>Manager</b> for tracking auctions in sites like eBay and an Internet Scrapbook to allow users to quickly and easily store and organize web content (for example an image or a piece of selected text). Preview releases of the browser included a feature called the MediaBar which integrated MP3 and internet radio playback, but this feature was dropped from the final version. The initial release was just for Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9, however two months after that release on May 15 a Mac OS X version was released, bundled with the Mac OS X DP4 release handed out to developers at the 2000 Worldwide Developers Conference. The Mac OS X Public Beta included another preview of the Mac OS X version of IE. The release of Mac OS X 10.0 on March 24, 2001 included yet another preview of the Mac OS X version of IE 5. This was updated later, and the release of Mac OS X v10.1 on September 25, 2001 included the final version of Internet Explorer 5.1 for Mac OS X.

The order is reversed {{at the end of each}} round so that the manager with the first overall pick does not maintain this advantage in every round.

40|$|M. Sc. This {{dissertation}} investigates how auctioneer agents can maximise {{the revenue}} of an auction. Auctions are an effective solution to agent negotiation {{because of their}} simplicity. They are therefore {{the most widely used}} approach to agent negotiation. A review of auction theory proves that auction revenue is influenced by factors such as the auction format and the auction parameters. The optimal auction format and parameters are dependent on the bidders and the auction environment. A study of internet auctions confirms the findings of auction theory regarding the importance of the format as well as the parameters in an auction. There has been significant research on the strategies bidding agents can adopt in order to maximise their utility. There is little research, however, on the strategies auctioneer agents can adopt to maximise auction revenue. In this study, a survey is done of the related auctioneer agents in research that maximise auction revenue. The shortcomings of these are identified. The aim of this research is to develop an adaptive auctioneer agent that can maximise the revenue of an auction. The proposed solution is the revenue maximising adaptive auctioneer (RMAA) agent. The RMAA agent consists of three components: the <b>auction</b> <b>manager,</b> the auction format selector (AFS) and the auction parameter selector (APS). The AFS employs a customised zeroth-level classifier system to select the auction format based on the auction environment. The APS employs reinforcement learning combined with a local hill climbing algorithm to learn what the most profitable values are for auction parameters, such as the reserve price and the bid increment. The <b>auction</b> <b>manager</b> automates the auction and coordinates the AFS and APS. It implements the four traditional auction formats, namely the English auction, the Dutch auction, the Vickrey auction and the first-price sealed-bid auction. Experiments conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the RMAA agent prove that this agent can consistently generate more revenue than a non-adaptive auctioneer agent. The contribution of this research is an auctioneer agent that adapts both the auction format and the auction parameters according to the environment in order to maximise the auction revenue...|$|E

As a potential solution to minimizing environmental impacts and social costs, we developed a smart market for sediment discharge. This approach would encourage individuals to internalize the environmental and social cost of sediment. The smart market system uses a hydrological simulator and a linear program that would allow an auctioneer to manage the third-party effects of trades, which are not possible with an ordinary auction. The system would give better price signals related to the sensitivity of key environmental features by location. Importantly, the proposed system would reduce transaction costs, because users {{do not need to}} search for trading partners, bargaining is simpler, price history information can be made available, and the <b>auction</b> <b>manager</b> ensures market discipline...|$|E

On the server side, bids submitted by auction participants are handled by a hierarchical organization of agents that can be efficiently distributed on a computer network. This approach avoids the bottlenecks of bid processing that might occur during periods of heavy bidding, like for example snipping. We present experimental results that show a significant improvement of the server throughput compared with the architecture where a single <b>auction</b> <b>manager</b> agent is used for coordinating the participants for each active auction that is registered with the server.

40|$|An English auction is {{the most}} {{familiar}} type of auctions. Generally, an electronic auction has mainly two entities, the registration manager (RM) who treats the registration of bidders, and the <b>auction</b> <b>manager</b> (AM) who holds auctions. Before starting an auction, a bidder who wants to participate in English auction is registered to RM with her/his information. An electronic English auction protocol should satisfy the following nine properties, (a) Anonymity, (b) Traceability, (c) No framing, (d) Unforgeability, (e) Fairness, (f) Verifiability, (g) Unlinkability among plural auctions, (h) Linkability in an auction, and (i) Efficiency of bidding. Furthermore from the practical point of view we add two properties (j) Easy revocation and (k) One-time registration. A group signature is adapted to an English auction {{in order to satisfy}} (a), (b), and (f). However such a direct adoption suffers from the most critical drawback of efficiency in group signatures. In this paper we propose more realistic electronic English auction scheme, which satisfies all of these properties without using a group signature. Notable features of our scheme are: (1) both of bidding and verification of bids are done quite efficiently by introducing a bulletin board, (2) both properties (j) Easy revocation and (k) One-time registration are satisfied...|$|E
40|$|In public auction, all bid {{values are}} published, but each bidder participates in auction {{protocol}} in anonymous way. Recently, Omote and Miyaji [OM 01] proposed {{a new model}} of public auction in which any bidder can participate in plural rounds of auction with one-time registration. They have introduced two managers, registration manager (RM) and <b>auction</b> <b>manager</b> (AM), and have used efficient tools such as bulletin board and signature of knowledge [CS 97]. In this scheme, even if a bidder is identified as a winner in a round, he can participate in next rounds of auction maintaining anonymity for RM, AM, and any bidder. But a problem of this protocol is that the identity of winner cannot be published. In the winner announcement stage, RM informs the vendor of winner's identity secretly. Therefore RM's nal role cannot be verified, and AM and any participating bidder can not be sure of the validity of auction. In this paper, we propose a new public auction scheme which can solve this problem. In the proposed scheme, both RM and AM execute randomization operation in round setup process which makes the publication of winner's identity be possible while keeping anonymity of winner in next rounds of auction. Moreover, AM provides ticket identifier based on Diffie-Hellman key agreement which is recognized only by the bidder. Our scheme provides real anonymity in plural rounds of auction with one-time registration in a verifiable way...|$|E

Because of the economic significance of ruminant {{livestock production}}, producers in the four-state area are continually looking for opportunities to increase income and improve the viability of their farm and ranch operation. Accordingly, the Four-state Ruminant Consortium, an integrated research and extension program, was created to specifically address issues related to ruminant livestock production. The purpose of the Four-State Ruminant Consortium is to enhance economic development in the target study area of southwestern North Dakota, northwestern South Dakota, southeastern Montana, and northeastern Wyoming by strengthening and capturing value from the ruminant livestock industry. This study sought to identify opportunities for and constraints to expanding value-added enterprises within the beef cow-calf sector. A number of sources were utilized in assessing opportunities and impediments to adopting value-added beef enterprises. A mail questionnaire was delivered to 5, 270 livestock producers in 37 counties in the 4 -state study area of southwestern North Dakota, northwestern South Dakota, southwestern Montana and northwestern Wyoming. The questionnaire was designed to solicit a wide variety of information about operators' current production practices, including marketing, backgrounding, retained ownership, herd management and feed and forage practices.

The auction network contributes significantly to models of price dynamics and the network predicts final sales prices better than economic (non-network) indicators alone. In addition, network analyses are useful in identifying the key bidders whose actions seem to exert disproportionate influence on other bidders and the final sales prices. Furthermore, the key bidders may be identified very early in an auction process, which has practical implications for the <b>auction</b> house <b>managers</b> and for other bidders...|$|R

We represent an auction as a network of bidders where the nodes represent the bidders participating in the auction and the ties between them represent an Influencer?Reactor relationship. We further develop a random effects bilinear model that is capable of handling covariates of both bidder types {{at the same time and}} account for higher order dependence among the bidders during the auction. Using the model and data from a Modern Indian Art auction, we find that Reactors tend to update their values on items that have high pre-auction estimates, bid on items created by high investment risk artists; bid selectively only on certain items; and are more active in the second half of the auction.

40|$|In Northwestern Portugal {{there is}} a large number of small fishing {{communities}} facing problems well characterized by several studies conducted in the region and in similar areas {{in other parts of the}} world. These problems undermine the social and economic fabric of these communities. At the economic level, the following issues can be pointed out: - Difficulties in the products' flow, mainly the ones with lower commercial value; - High production operational costs; - Difficulties managing the value chain of fishery products, mainly in what concerns trading; - Low ability in the management of innovation in the fish value chain; - Difficulty in establishing long lasting relationships with all intervenients in the value chain. In view of this reality, Project INOVEMAR was created by the food engineering group of the Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo, in co-operation with the Social Services of the same institute, and Docapesca, the national fish <b>auction</b> <b>managers.</b> The objective of the project is to improve the utilization of fish species with less commercial value and create new alternatives to produce flow. These processes include: •	a betterment of typical products and processes, such as canned products and patés; •	the evaluation of the success in the introduction of foreign produce, such as smoked and marinated fish; •	the development of new processes and products based on low commercial valued species; •	the production of ready-to-eat fish meals preserved in cold storage and modified atmospheres. Following information conveyed by Docapesca, the less valued species captured in the region are different mackerel species, Atlantic horse mackerel, pout, octopus and mullet. Mackerel and Atlantic horse mackerel, due to their high subcutaneous fat were used for smoking and for the production of canned smoked fillets and patés, with different sauces. The smoking process included: washing fresh fish, 30 minutes immersion in a 80 º brine, followed by dripping and drying for 48 h. Smoking was carried out at 70 ºC during 3 h, with a final stage at 90 ºC. Several paté formulations were developed with mackerel and atlantic horse mackerel, with different types and quantities of ingredients and flavourings to obtain different products. Special attention was paid to the amounts of thickeners and emulsifiers to attain a pleasant spread ability. All preparations were sterilized for 15 minutes at 121 ºC. A sensory panel with 10 judges and a consumer panel with 59 consumers were used to test the developed products. The 59 consumers (17 - 25 years of age) classified smoked products as moderately pleasant. 82 % of the consumers tested expressed willingness to purchase the product. In what concerns patés, sensory judges as well as consumers rated the majority of products as very good in the several parameters under evaluation, indication that {{there is a}} great potential for these type of commodities. Several fish species are being studied for pre-cooking conservation. In all the cases studied, typical Portuguese cuisine is being used, followed by rapid chilling and packing with modified atmospheres. Preparations, preservation and subsequent consumption are being carried out at the school's canteen. The results obtained until now show that low commercial valued species can be used with success, providing some culinary expertise is added. This is a very important aspect since, transferring this technology to industry, may lead to the development of new products and help an easy flow of these products into the market. Consequently, fishing communities will be able to sell all their produce, reducing waste, and increasing their economic situation...|$|R

40|$|The global {{art market}} has {{undergone}} a huge transition {{in the last decade}} leading to the creation of new art hedge funds, art mutual funds, and art online auction sites. The increasing interest in the overall art market has also helped popularize emerging art markets such as Indian contemporary art. In this paper we focus on simultaneous online auctions (SOA) for Indian contemporary art. SOAs sell high-value items in auctions that take place simultaneously and are different from popular individual auctions (e. g. eBay) in multiple ways and in particular in that they induce high levels of competition both within and between auctions. The SOA art marketplace has the promise of extremely high profits but also the risk of high losses if not monitored carefully. Forecasting price during an ongoing SOA is therefore important to <b>auction</b> house <b>managers,</b> who can make real-time decisions and intervene while an auction is in progress. We present a novel dynamic forecasting approach for predicting price in ongoing simultaneous online art auctions. Our model forecasts the price from the time of prediction until auction close and updates its prediction in real-time as the auction progresses based on newly arriving information and price dynamics. We find high predictive accuracy of the dynamic model for a data set of contemporary Indian art SOAs and compare its performance to more traditional approaches. We then investigate the source of the predictive power of price dynamics and find that dynamics capture bidder competition within and across auctions. The importance of this finding is both conceptual and practical: price dynamics are simple to compute at high accuracy, as they require information only from the focal auction and are therefore a parsimonious representation of different forms of within-auction and between-auction competition...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses selected {{works of}} Grant Wood's {{art as a}} touchtone to investigate a broader visual culture surrounding agriculture in America during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries. By doing so I argue that Wood engaged with pressing social questions, including the phenomenon now referred to as agribusiness. Although agribusiness is often associated with the Green Revolution of the 1940 s and 1950 s, its beginning dates to the nineteenth century. Indeed, Wood's lifetime was an era when land was consolidated, production and distribution were vertically integrated, and breeding became scientifically informed. To access the power dynamics of this transition, I begin each chapter with work by Wood, and then analyze it in conjunction with imagery produced by or for individuals with diverse cultural agendas. This wide range of voices includes government officials, members of socialist farm organizations, newspaper publishers, plant breeders, owners of large and small farms, <b>auction</b> house <b>managers,</b> and university educators. To show precedents for and the legacy of Wood's work I begin my analysis of visual culture before his birth and end after his death. The dissertation thus begins in 1862 —the year that land in the Midwest began to be parceled out for grain farming as small 160 -acre homesteads and gargantuan bonanza farms thousands of acres in size. The dissertation ends in 1957 —the year that the term agribusiness was coined by the Harvard-based economists John Davis and Ray Goldberg. I take an interdisciplinary approach anchored most fully within the norms of art history, but also engage with strategies from visual, cultural, and agricultural studies. My argument, ultimately, is that agribusiness is a cornerstone of modern thinking, and that Grant Wood was not only aware of the experiences, debates, institutions, and theories of agribusiness emerging in his midst but engaged with them in his fine art. More broadly, by using a wide range of imagery, including photography, advertising, penmanship, film stills, crops, cartoons, architecture, and diagrams I show that the way Americans came to understand and accept agribusiness as the basis of their food system was negotiated, in part, through visual materials...|$|R
