40|$|The {{timing of}} {{reproduction}} of many species depends on seasonal changes in prolactin secretion. Photoperiod coincides with annual seasonal changes and typically regulates prolactin secretion. However, when environmental conditions are unpredictable, other ecological factors {{may contribute to}} prolactin regulation. In <b>African</b> <b>striped</b> mice (Rhabdomys pumilio), males show seasonal changes in reproduction and in prolactin levels, but unexpected increases of food availability out of the regular breeding season can also induce reproduction. We measured prolactin levels in free-ranging male <b>African</b> <b>striped</b> mice during three periods: (1) the natural breeding in spring with increasing photoperiod; (2) the natural nonbreeding season in summer (dry season) with decreasing photoperiod; and (3) during two summers with unexpected rainfall inducing breeding in the population. Here, we report that breeding males showed increased prolactin levels when they were breeding independently of increases and decreases in day length. Also, we found a positive correlation (P = 0. 05) between the availability of food plants and prolactin levels. Changes in prolactin levels in opportunistically breeding species like the <b>African</b> <b>striped</b> mouse are not strictly regulated by photoperiod, but seem to respond to cues from food availability...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIndividual recognition, {{the ability}} to {{discriminate}} between members of a social group according to their distinctive characteristics, is a sophisticated form of social recognition. Several laboratory studies demonstrated individual recognition in rodents, but not under natural conditions. We combined behavioral observations and an experiment to assess individual recognition in free-living <b>African</b> <b>striped</b> mice Rhabdomys pumilio. Striped mice live in groups that share a nest, but forage alone during the day. Interactions among group members are typically amicable and {{take place at the}} nest. In order to determine whether striped mice have individualized relationships, we analyzed whether focal mice interacted repeatedly more often with one specific group member. Data from 58 focal individuals from 15 groups revealed that the individual with which amicable interactions occurred the most was often alone in one mode of the data distribution, indicating that behavior toward this specific individual differed compared to the behavior to all other group members. Striped mice consistently preferred this specific individual during the following weeks. Preferred social partners of both breeders and younger non-breeders were young non-breeders. Sex-specific effects were obtained only for young adult males and breeding females, which both associated more often with the opposite sex. For 11 young adults from 11 groups, the preferred social partner was trapped and removed, either overnight (experiment) or only during the day (control), when striped mice forage solitarily and usually do not interact with group members. Striped mice interacted on average more with their preferred social partner after it returned in the experimental group compared to the control (7 of 11 experiments), but the difference was not significant (P = 0. 16). Our study indicates that striped mice might have individualized relationships, although they failed to significantly indicate individual recognition during experimental removals.

40|$|International audienceStudying the {{association}} between fitness and cognition in free-living animals is a fundamental step in the elucidation {{of the evolution of}} cognition. We assessed whether survival until the onset of the breeding season was related to reaction time or spatial memory in the <b>African</b> <b>striped</b> mouse Rhabdomys pumilio, a rodent that has to survive summer drought before breeding. We tested a total of 90 individuals at the beginning of summer. Female survival was related to a faster response to predation stimuli. Male survival increased with greater spatial memory, possibly because it is important for males to remember the configuration of the environment during dispersal. This study revealed that individual variation in reaction time and spatial memory can be related to survival probability, which is important for understanding the selection pressures acting on basic cognitive traits...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMammalian colour {{patterns}} {{are among the}} most recognizable characteristics found in nature and can have a profoundimpact on fitness. However, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms underlying the formation and subsequent evolutionof these patterns. Here we show that, in the <b>African</b> <b>striped</b> mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio), periodic dorsal stripes resultfrom underlying differences in melanocyte maturation, which give rise to spatial variation in hair colour. We identify thetranscription factor ALX 3 as a regulator of this process. In embryonic dorsal skin, patterned expression of Alx 3 precedespigment stripes and acts to directly repress Mitf, a master regulator of melanocyte differentiation, thereby giving rise tolight-coloured hair. Moreover, Alx 3 is upregulated in the light stripes of chipmunks, which have independently evolveda similar dorsal pattern. Our results show a previously undescribed mechanism for modulating spatial variation in haircolour and provide insights into how phenotypic novelty evolves...|$|R
40|$|During early {{demersal}} ontogeny, many {{marine fishes}} display complex habitat-use patterns. Grunts of the speciose genus Haemulon {{are among the}} most abundant fishes on western North Atlantic coral reefs, with most species settling to shallow habitats (# 12 m). To gain understanding into cross-shelf distributional patterns exhibited by newly settled stages of grunts (, 2 cm total length), we examined: 1) depth-specific distributions of congeners at settlement among sites at 8 m, 12 m, and 21 m, and 2) depth-variable predation pressure on newly settled individuals (species pooled). Of the six species identified from collections of newly settled specimens (n = 2125), Haemulon aurolineatum (tomtate), H. flavolineatum (French grunt), and H. striatum (<b>striped</b> <b>grunt)</b> comprised 98 % of the total abundance; with the first two species present at all sites. Prevalence of H. aurolineatum and H. flavolineatum decreased substantially from the 8 -m site to the two deeper sites. In contrast, H. striatum was absent from the 8 -m site and exhibited its highest frequency at the 21 -m site. Comparison of newly settled grunt delta density for all species on caged (predator exclusion) and control artificial reefs at the shallowest site (8 -m) revealed no difference, while the 12 -m and 21 -m sites exhibited significantly greater delta densities on the caged treatment. This result, along with significantly higher abundances of co-occurring piscivorous fishes at the deeper sites, indicated lower predation pressure at the 8 -m site. This study suggests habitat-use patterns of newly settled stages of some coral reef fishes that undergo ontogenetic shifts are a function of depth-variable predation pressure while, for at least one deeper-wate...|$|R
40|$|Flexibility – {{reversible}} phenotypic {{changes in}} physiology, morphology, and / or behaviour – {{has been extensively}} studied {{in the framework of}} alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs). A reproductive tactic is a phenotype that results from a strategy – a decision rule based on genetic program. The relative plasticity hypothesis states that environmentally-induced hormonal changes cause the development of one out several possible ARTs. However, causality between hormones and ARTs has been poorly studied. Further, it is important to determine which environmental factors influence hormonal changes in males of different ARTs to determine in how far these hormonal changes are flexible. In this thesis, I experimentally studied the role of testosterone in causing physiological, morphological, and behavioural differences between two alternative reproductive tactics in male <b>African</b> <b>striped</b> mice, Rhabdomys pumilio: 1) group-living helpers showing alloparental care, low testosterone levels, and high corticosterone levels. 2) solitary 14 living roamers showing no parental care, high testosterone levels, and low corticosterone levels. Finally, I tested the flexibility of prolactin secretion as prolactin {{may play a role in}} the regulation of ARTs. For this, I studied the role of photoperiod and food availability in regulating prolactin levels of paternal dominant breeding males. In chapter 1 I studied which factors correlate with alloparental care. For the first time I demonstrated that both male and female, juvenile and adult philopatrics show extensive helping behaviour (14. 7 % of their time). Corticosterone levels correlated with alloparental care in an age- and sex-dependent manner. Natural variation of testosterone levels between helpers did not correlate with alloparental care, suggesting that changes in alloparental care after the tactic switch are not caused by testosterone. In chapter 2, I tested whether an experimental increase of testosterone in male group living helpers influenced alloparental care and dispersal-like behaviours. An experimental increase of testosterone in male group-living helpers did not reduce alloparental care nor aggressive behaviour, but increased boldness, decreased anxiety, and lowered basal corticosterone levels. In the field, exogenous testosterone did not cause dispersal, but it caused male group-living helpers to expand their home ranges (chapter 3). I suggested that an increase of testosterone facilitate dispersal by reducing stress reactivity (low corticosterone levels and low anxiety). Exogenous testosterone also induced sexual maturation and spermatogenesis – testosterone-treated male group-living helpers became scrotal and showed larger testes and epididymis (chapter 3). Thus, I suggested that a quick increase of testosterone levels is an important event during the tactic switch to cause necessary Summary physiological, morphological, and behavioural changes in group-living helpers to disperse and become solitary-living roamers. In chapter 4 I showed that free-ranging paternal dominant breeding males showedhigher prolactin levels when they were breeding compared to the non-breeding season, independently whether this was during spring (increase of photoperiod) or during summer, i. e. normal non-breeding season (decrease of photoperiod). Food availability correlated with prolactin levels, suggesting that cues related to food availability may regulate prolactin levels. As paternal dominant breeding males have higher reproductive success than males following an alternative reproductive tactic (i. e. group-living helpers and solitary-living roamers), flexibility in prolactin secretion seems adaptive. My thesis demonstrated that testosterone plays an important role in physiological,morphological and behavioural differences between males of different ARTs in <b>African</b> <b>striped</b> mice. I also showed that the role of environmental factors (e. g. food availability) iscrucial in hormonal flexibility (prolactin levels). Thus, studies from the <b>African</b> <b>striped</b> mousesuggest a complex relationship between hormonal and environmental factors in the regulation of ARTs. For future studies, I discussed how to integrate environmental factors in the behavioural endocrinology approach to study proximate mechanisms of ART...|$|R
