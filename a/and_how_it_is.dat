5|$|The game {{primarily}} {{focuses on}} Zack Fair, a young {{member of the}} paramilitary organization SOLDIER, who is assigned {{to look for the}} missing SOLDIER Genesis Rhapsodos. As he searches for Genesis, Zack discovers Genesis' origin, Project G, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> related to two other high-ranking SOLDIERs; Sephiroth and Angeal Hewley. The game's storyline takes the player from the war between the megacorporation Shinra and the people of Wutai to the events in Nibelheim, ending just before the beginning of Final Fantasy VII.|$|E
5|$|The purely orchestral works {{fall into}} two categories. The best-known ones in the West, and perhaps the finest in overall quality, are mainly {{programmatic}} in nature—in other words, the musical content <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> handled in the piece {{is determined by the}} plot or characters in a story, the action in a painting or events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works are more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.|$|E
5|$|Following the Great Fire of Smyrna, Lefty and Desdemona {{must start}} life anew. When she is 14years old, Callie {{experiences}} a second birth to become Cal. To become a male, Callie peregrinates across the United States {{and becomes a}} midwife of her new life by teaching herself to forget what she has learned as a female. Likewise, Cal's grandparents undergo a transformation, becoming husband and wife instead of brother and sister. Middlesex delves into the concept of identity, including how it is formed <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> administered. The immigrant predicament is a metaphor and synecdoche for Calliope's hermaphroditic condition; Callie's paternal grandparents become Americanized through the amalgamation {{of the elements of}} heredity, cultural metamorphoses, and probability. Callie's maternal grandfather, Jimmy Zizmo, undergoes a rebirth when he transforms from a bootlegger into Fard Muhammad, a Muslim minister.|$|E

5|$|The Hindu elite {{follow the}} {{religious}} ideology of Shaiva Siddhanta (Shaiva school) while masses practice folk Hinduism, upholding {{their faith in}} local village deities not found in formal Hindu scriptures. The place of worship depends on the object of worship <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> housed. It could be a proper Hindu temple known as a Koyil, constructed according to the Agamic scripts (a set of scriptures regulating the temple cult). More often, however, the temple is not completed in accordance with Agamic scriptures but consists of the barest essential structure housing a local deity. These temples observe daily Puja (prayers) hours and are attended by locals. Both types of temples have a resident ritualist or priest known as a Kurukkal. A Kurukkal may belong to someone from a prominent local lineage like Pandaram or Iyer community. In the Eastern Province, a Kurukkal usually belongs to Lingayat sect. Other places of worship do not have icons for their deities. The sanctum could house a trident (culam), a stone, or a large tree. Temples of this type are common in the Northern and Eastern Provinces; a typical village has up to 150 such structures. The offering would be done by an elder of the family who owns the site. A coconut oil lamp would be lit on Fridays, and a special rice dish known as pongal would be cooked either on a day considered auspicious by the family or on the Thai Pongal day, and possibly on Tamil New Year Day.|$|E
