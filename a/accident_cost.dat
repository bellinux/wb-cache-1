In July Raw temporarily vacated his position at No. 2 Squadron so he could focus on preparing for the air race. The Canberras piloted by Raw and Cuming departed Australia for the United Kingdom on 10 September, and the race began on 9 October.

40|$|This article {{shows that}} extant rights-based {{theories}} of accident law contain a gaping hole. They inadequately address the following question: What justifies using community standards to assign <b>accident</b> <b>costs</b> in tort law? In the United States, the jury determines negligence for accidental harm by asking whether the defendant met the objective reasonable person standard. However, what determines {{the content of}} the reasonable person standard is enigmatic. Some tort theorists say that the content is filled out by juries using cost benefit analysis while others say that juries apply community norms and conventions. I demonstrate that what is missing from this exchange is a theory that adequately justifies using a particular way of filling out {{the content of the}} objective reasonable person standard. Rights-based theories are particularly guilty of ignoring what I call the central normative concern. That concern is what criterion should determine the amount of precaution an individual must use to avoid being justifiably assigned others’ <b>accident</b> <b>costs.</b> To identify this problem I focus on rights-based theories of accident law. After showing how several rights-based theories of accident law inadequately address the central normative concern, I briefly outline a theory of assigning <b>accident</b> <b>costs</b> that has the potential for offering the best answer to the central normative concern. The most important aspect of this theory, called democratic community standard theory, is that it provides a justification for using community standards to adjudicate tort claims.

40|$|Optimal safety {{standards}} under moral hazard when accident prevention {{is a function}} of both firm- and worker efforts. A double principle-agent model is developed to analyze optimal safety regulation when accident risks are affected by decisions made by the firm as well as the firm’s employees (workers). The regulator perfectly observes the safety investments of the firm, but can not observe worker safety decisions, while the firm imperfectly observes the worker safety decisions. It is shown, in the case of no regulation, that the first-best is unattainable unless third-party <b>accident</b> <b>costs</b> are absent and the firm uses performance payments. The optimal regulatory standard produces a sub-optimal solution and is shown to depend on safety effort <b>costs,</b> the <b>accident</b> technology, the distribution of <b>accident</b> <b>costs</b> across firms, workers and third-parties, and the firm’s ability to observe worker safety efforts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Accident</b> <b>costs</b> are an {{important}} component of external costs of traffic, a substantial part is related to fatal accidents. The evaluation of fatal <b>accident</b> <b>costs</b> crucially depends on the availability of an estimate for the economic value of a statistical life. This paper aims to develop a model for road accident through systems dynamics approach. To build an accident model, various factors causing the road <b>accident</b> and <b>cost</b> were identified. This model is capable of calculating the accident rate and its costs for the future. In this study the accident caused by bus alone is considered. The cost model is dealt more in this study as it requires more complex assessment. The accident model is built on the year 2000 data and predicted the accidents up to 2020 for every 5 -year interval. The accident model is valuated by comparing the predicted and actual accident data for the year 2005. Three scenarios were studied by changing the income growth rate and discount rate. Finally, best scenario is suggested for implementation. The outcome of the study is highly useful for the planners, administrators and police to make their decisions effectively for road safety investment projects...|$|R
