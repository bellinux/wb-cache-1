25|$|In {{spite of}} ongoing {{efforts to improve}} water {{resources}} management in Honduras, many challenges continue to exist such as insufficient employment generation, unfavorable investment climate, overvalued currency, lack of credit, high commercial interest rates, deficient infrastructure (water delivery, electricity, communications, and roads), weak legal institutions, inadequate education and workforce productivity, burdensome bureaucratic obstacles, and an unstable political climate. As Honduras {{and the international community}} work together to address these hurdles, Honduras will improve water supplies, quality of water, efficiency in irrigation, important freshwater wildlife habitats, and reduce <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> damage.|$|E

5000|$|Before the {{construction}} of the Aswan High Dam the <b>annual</b> <b>flooding</b> of the Nile (وفاء النيل [...] ) provided fertile and hydrated soil for the vines, and the stable weather conditions made it a competitive location for the cultivation of wine grapes. After {{the construction}} of the dam in 1970 the <b>annual</b> <b>flooding</b> stopped. Today vineyards in Egypt use drip irrigation {{to make up for the}} lack of rain.|$|R

25|$|Before the {{construction}} of dams on the Nile, particularly the Aswan High Dam (started in 1960, completed in 1970), the fertility of the Nile Valley was sustained by the water flow and the silt deposited by the <b>annual</b> <b>flood.</b> Sediment is now obstructed by the Aswan High Dam and retained in Lake Nasser. The interruption of yearly, natural fertilization and the increasing salinity of the soil has been a manageable problem resulting from the dam. The benefits remain impressive: more intensive farming on thousands of square kilometers of land made possible by improved irrigation, prevention of flood damage, and the generation of millions of gigajoules of electricity at low cost.|$|E
25|$|When {{agriculture}} {{was first}} developed, simple hand-held digging sticks and hoes {{were used in}} highly fertile areas, such as {{the banks of the}} Nile where the <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> rejuvenates the soil, to create drills (furrows) to plant seeds in. Digging sticks, hoes, and mattocks were not invented in any one place, and hoe-cultivation must have been common everywhere agriculture was practiced. Hoe-farming is the traditional tillage method in tropical or sub-tropical regions, which are characterised by stony soils, steep slope gradients, predominant root crops, and coarse grains grown at wide distances apart. While hoe-agriculture is best suited to these regions, it is used in some fashion everywhere. Instead of hoeing, some cultures use pigs to trample the soil and grub the earth.|$|E
25|$|Landforms {{present in}} this region include the upland terra firme (non-flooded) mostly on nutrient-poor {{lateritic}} soils, ancient alluvial plains (mostly non-flooded) on nutrient-rich soils, and present alluvial plains (várzea, seasonally flooded) of super-rich sediments renewed with each <b>annual</b> <b>flood.</b> Floristically, distinct lowland humid forest types occur {{on each of these}} landforms with the terra firme mature forests and late successional, seasonally flooded forest being the two major types. Permanent swamp forests are common on the alluvial plains. Pockets of nutrient-poor white sand soils are found here that host forests of lower height, a more open forest canopy, and lower alpha diversity, but with many endemics. The forests are mostly dense tropical rain forest, but some patches of open forest exist.|$|E

25|$|To {{organize}} {{and feed the}} manpower needed to create these pyramids required a centralized government with extensive powers, and Egyptologists believe the Old Kingdom at this time demonstrated this level of sophistication. Recent excavations near the pyramids led by Mark Lehner have uncovered a large city {{that seems to have}} housed, fed and supplied the pyramid workers. Although it was once believed that slaves built these monuments, a theory based on The Exodus narrative of the Hebrew Bible, study of the tombs of the workmen, who oversaw construction on the pyramids, has shown they were built by a corvée of peasants drawn from across Egypt. They apparently worked while the <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> covered their fields, as well as a very large crew of specialists, including stonecutters, painters, mathematicians and priests.|$|E
2500|$|Black soils of {{floodplains}} are fertile, grasses grow {{on them as}} soon as the <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> recedes {{and provide}} a rich resource [...] for herbivores. If the <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> is disrupted by dams, woody shrubs of lower nutritional value tend to replace grasses and so reduce the number of herbivores and biodiversity.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{insufficient}} rainfall in the Timbuktu region for purely rain-fed agriculture and crops are therefore irrigated using {{water from the}} River Niger. The main agricultural crop is rice. African floating rice (Oryza glaberrima) has traditionally been grown in regions near the river that are inundated during the <b>annual</b> <b>flood.</b> Seed is sown {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season (June–July) so that when the flood water arrives plants are already [...] in height.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> of the Niger River is {{a result}} of the heavy {{rainfall}} in the headwaters of the Niger and Bani rivers in Guinea and northern Ivory Coast. The rainfall in these areas peaks in August but the flood water takes time to pass down the river system and through the Inner Niger Delta. At Koulikoro, [...] downstream from Bamako, the flood peaks in September, while in Timbuktu the flood lasts longer and usually reaches a maximum at the end of December.|$|E
2500|$|The Ancient Egyptian Sadd-el-Kafara Dam at Wadi Al-Garawi, {{located about}} [...] south of Cairo, was [...] long {{at its base}} and [...] wide. The {{structure}} was built around 2800 or 2600 BC as a diversion dam for flood control, but was destroyed by heavy rain during construction or shortly afterwards. During the Twelfth Dynasty in the 19th century BC, the Pharaohs Senosert III, Amenemhat III and Amenmehat IV dug a canal [...] long linking the Fayum Depression to the Nile in Middle Egypt. Two dams called Ha-Uar running east-west were built to retain water during the <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> and then release it to surrounding lands.

2500|$|Aquarius is {{identified}} as [...] "The Great One" [...] in the Babylonian star catalogues and represents the god Ea himself, who is commonly depicted holding an overflowing vase. The Babylonian star-figure appears on entitlement stones and cylinder seals from the second millennium. It contained the winter solstice in the Early Bronze Age. In Old Babylonian astronomy, Ea was the ruler of the southernmost quarter of the Sun's path, the [...] "Way of Ea", corresponding to the period of 45 days {{on either side of}} winter solstice. Aquarius was also associated with the destructive floods that the Babylonians regularly experienced, and thus was negatively connoted. In Ancient Egypt astronomy, Aquarius was associated with the <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> of the Nile; the banks were said to flood when Aquarius put his jar into the river, beginning spring.|$|E

2500|$|The Zambezi river, {{upstream}} from the falls, experiences a rainy season from late November to early April, and a dry season {{the rest of}} the year. The river's <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> season is February to May with a peak in April,/s (318,000 cu ft) is quoted by many websites for Victoria Falls but this is the mean maximum instantaneous rate, which is only achieved for a few days per year. The figure of 536 million m3/minute (18.9 billion cu ft/min) on some websites (e.g. ZNTB) is an error for 536 million litres/minute (equivalent to 9100 m3/s or 142 million U.S. gallons/min). The '10-year maximum' is the mean of the maximum monthly rate returned in a ten-year period. The spray from the falls typically rises to a height of over 400 metres (1,300ft), and sometimes even twice as high, and is visible from up to [...] away. At full moon, a [...] "moonbow" [...] {{can be seen in the}} spray instead of the usual daylight rainbow. During the flood season, however, it is impossible to see the foot of the falls and most of its face, and the walks along the cliff opposite it are in a constant shower and shrouded in mist. Close to the edge of the cliff, spray shoots upward like inverted rain, especially at Zambia's Knife-Edge Bridge.|$|E
60|$|Bad weather, {{very heavy}} rains, and an unusually early {{rise in the}} Missouri, {{rendered}} the ascent of the river toilsome, slow, and dangerous. The rise of the Missouri does not generally take place until the month of May or June: the present swelling of the river must {{have been caused by}} a freshet in some of its more southern branches. It could not have been the great <b>annual</b> <b>flood,</b> as the higher branches must still have been ice-bound.|$|E

For the first five days they had a fair and fresh breeze, and the boats made good progress. The wind then came ahead, and the river beginning to rise, and to increase in rapidity, betokened the commencement of the <b>annual</b> <b>flood,</b> caused by the melting of the snow on the Rocky Mountains, and the vernal rains of the upper prairies.|$|E

60|$|Yet he who had {{not seen}} the desert or felt the sun heavily on his {{shoulders}} would hardly admire the fertility of the riparian scrub. Unnourishing reeds and grasses grow rank and coarse from the water's edge. The dark, rotten soil between the tussocks is cracked and granulated by the drying up of the <b>annual</b> <b>flood.</b> The character of the vegetation is inhospitable. Thorn-bushes, bristling like hedgehogs and thriving arrogantly, everywhere predominate and with their prickly tangles obstruct or forbid the path. Only the palms by the brink are kindly, and men journeying along the Nile must look often towards their bushy tops, where among the spreading foliage the red and yellow glint of date clusters proclaims the ripening of a generous crop, and protests that Nature is not always mischievous and cruel.|$|E
60|$|The {{other natural}} wonder of Egypt was the annual rising of the Nile. About midsummer, the {{peasantry}} who lived {{along the banks}} would find the river gradually beginning to rise. The stream became more turbid, too, as the bosom of the waters swelled. No cause for this mysterious increase appeared, as the sky remained as blue and serene as before, and the sun, then nearly vertical, continued to shine with even more than its wonted splendor. The inhabitants however, felt no surprise, and asked for no explanation of the phenomenon. It was the common course of nature at that season. They had all witnessed it, year after year, from childhood. They, of course, looked for it when the proper month came round, and, though {{they would have been}} amazed if the <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> had failed, they thought nothing extraordinary of its coming.|$|E
60|$|In the {{occurrence}} of these annual inundations lies one of several resemblances between {{the valley of the}} Euphrates and that of the Nile. But there are important differences. The time of the <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> is reversed, the Nile being highest in autumn and winter, and lowest in spring and early summer. The periodical overflows of the Nile, regulated by the great lake basins in the south, are usually punctual in arrival, gradual in growth, and beneficial in operation. No lakes are interposed between the mountain torrents of the upper basis of the Tigris and the Euphrates and their lower courses. Hence, heavy rain, or an unusually rapid thaw in the uplands, gives rise to the sudden irruption of a vast volume of water which not even the rapid Tigris, still less its more sluggish companion, can carry off in time to prevent violent and dangerous overflows. Without an elaborate system of canalisation, providing an escape for such sudden excesses of the supply of water, the annual floods of the Euphrates, and especially of the Tigris, must always be attended with risk, and often prove harmful.|$|E
