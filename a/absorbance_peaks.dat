The structural and optical properties of (Cu 2 O) nanoparticles were investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-VIS Spectroscopy. XRD analysis has indexed nanocrystalline nature of cubical phase Cu 2 O with an average edge length of about 20 nm. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) measurements also ascertain the cubical morphology. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) affirms the presence of characteristic functional group of Cu 2 O. The <b>absorbance</b> <b>peak</b> at 485 nm in UV-VIS spectra also confirms the Cu 2 O synthesis. Furthermore, UV-VIS absorbance spectra at different ageing time substantiate the phase stability of Cu 2 O nanoparticles. The ageing leads to blue shift of <b>absorbance</b> <b>peak</b> mainly due to decrease in Cu 2 O particle size with no additional <b>absorbance</b> <b>peak</b> in UV-VIS spectra indicating the formation of secondary phase. The {{reduction in particle size}} may be attributed to tiny conversion Cu 2 O to CuO.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that there have been many studies of {{graphite}} exfoliation, none really addresses the issue of starting form of graphite. To address this issue various graphite forms (solid, powder and sooth) and graphite oxide (powder) are exfoliated in acetonitrile and studied via ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. In different graphite forms two major <b>absorbance</b> <b>peaks</b> are observed at 223 nm and 273 nm corresponding to graphene oxide and graphene dispersions, respectively. The intensity change of the peaks refers to the layer number change. The intensity ratios of these peaks give information about the concentration of the exfoliation products. We observed that graphite oxide sample has the thinnest graphene dispersions among the compared samples, whereas graphite rod has the thickest. It appears that few layer graphene oxide dispersions exist more in graphite sooth and graphite oxide samples. Graphite oxide UV-Vis spectrum reveals two new <b>absorbance</b> <b>peaks</b> at 312 nm and 361 nm in addition to the graphene oxide and graphene dispersion peaks.

When liquid cultures of FF 48 strain were grown they were assayed for the chrome azurol sulphonate (CAS) agar plate test according to Schwyn and Neilands (1987). Liquid cultures were centrifuged at 10, 000 rpm for 15 min and filtered at 0.2 µm with a syringe filter (Millipore) to obtain an undiluted, cell-free supernatant, which was examined {{for the presence of}} siderophores by the CAS assay (Schwyn and Neilands 1987). The nature of the siderophores produced in the supernatant was determined preliminarily by the FeCl 3 test, examining the maximum absorption of the iron-siderophore complex using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (TU- 1810 S Split Beam). One ml of supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of aqueous FeCl 3 (2 %), and a spectrogram was then done between 400 and 500 nm, using supernatant without FeCl 3 as blank. The complex ferric hydroxamate siderophore should exhibit an <b>absorbance</b> <b>peak</b> between 420 and 450 nm, and the ferric catecholate shows an <b>absorbance</b> <b>peak</b> at 495 nm (Jalal and Helm 1991).

Lipid extracts of FMF sera retained neutrophil-aggregating activity and had UV <b>absorbance</b> <b>peaks</b> at 269 and 279 nm, indicating {{the presence of}} lipids with a conjugated triene structure.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{temperature}} on real time changes in optical density (ΔOD) of GAFCHROMIC® EBT film were investigated. The spectral peak of maximum change in absorbance (λmax) {{was shown to}} downshift linearly when {{the temperature of the}} film was increased from 22 to 38 °C. The ΔOD values were also shown to decrease linearly with temperature, and this decrease could not be attributed to the shift in λmax. A compensation scheme using λmax and a temperature-dependent correction factor was investigated, but provided limited improvement. Part of the reason may be the fluctuations in hydration of the active component, which were found to affect both position of <b>absorbance</b> <b>peaks</b> and the sensitivity of the film. To test the effect of hydration, laminated and unlaminated films were desiccated. This shifted both the major and minor <b>absorbance</b> <b>peaks</b> in the opposite direction to the change observed with temperature. The desiccated film also exhibited reduced sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Rehydration of the desiccated films did not reverse the effects, but rather gave rise to another form of the polymer with absorbance maxima upshifted further 20 nm.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{propose a}} general theme, labeled mechan-ical electrodynamics, where the {{relative}} three-dimensional (3 -D) orientation {{of particles with}} nontrivial geometries is tracked based {{on the details of}} the absorption spectrum beyond a one-dimensional (1 -D) distance dependence. Specifically, we simulate absorption spectra of a subwavelength denture-like nanostructure with freely moving parts. The nanodentures are made of two gold nanoarches that either open and close or rotate about a single arch base (hinge rotation). We show how the absorption spectrum for the nanodentures changes depending on orientation and position. There is a ∼ 0. 1 − 0. 2 eV shift in <b>absorbance</b> <b>peak</b> frequencies as the denture closes, corresponding to an increased coupling between the two gold arches, while a hinge rotation results in a depletion of one <b>absorbance</b> <b>peak</b> (1. 48 eV) with the simultaneous emergence of a new <b>absorbance</b> <b>peak</b> at lower frequencies (0. 88 eV). The unique spectral signature of each position and orientation of the nanodentures points to a variety of applications. One will be experimentally tracking and measuring orientation and position of plasmonic-coupled nanoparticles using simple methods such as UV−vis or IR spectral analysis. Additionally, the denture structure will tune in and out of different plasmon resonance frequencies, or turn “on and off, ” depending on its orientation. The simulations were performed efficiently by the recent near-field (NF) approach, which is a time-dependent Poisson algorithm that shares a lot of the machinery of full-fledged Maxwell equations but allows for much larger time steps and therefore can treat large systems.
