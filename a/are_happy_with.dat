5|$|Maier {{writes that}} the novel {{includes}} themes of love, with Hidjo's love for Woengoe, Betje, and Biroe paralleling that of Walter's love for Roos, Woengoe, and Betje. He also notes {{that there is a}} theme of social mobility, where Hidjo's relationships with noble women are fostered by his merchant father to grant the family a greater social position; bride prices also feature prominently, showing that one can become a noble through marriage if one has enough money. He notes that, {{towards the end of the}} novel, love is described as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find, as the social-financial meaning of marriage remains predominant among the traditional Javanese. The characters, despite not all marrying for love, <b>are</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> their eventual partners and have a comfortable life.|$|E
25|$|After the wedding, the Pandava {{brothers}} are invited back to Hastinapura. The Kuru family elders and relatives negotiate and broker a split of the kingdom, with the Pandavas obtaining a new territory.

25|$|Single-mother and lower-class {{families}} {{have a much}} more difficult time negotiating childcare or finding sustainable childcare options. The breadwinner-homemaker family and economic model does not apply to single-parent families because the single-parent must be both roles at all times. Because child care services cost a substantial amount, low-income mothers spend a higher percentage of their income on child care than middle class mothers do. Few low-income mothers <b>are</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> their childcare arrangements {{especially in light of the}} fact that low-income childcare arrangements suffer from frequent disruptions. In the United States, state assistance for childcare is nowhere near the level of other developed countries and has actually decreased.|$|E

25|$|When Estonia regained its {{independence}} in 1991, Narva again became a border city. Local leaders, holdovers from the Soviet era, wanted autonomy, and {{contended that the}} notion of a breakaway 'Transnarovan SSR' republic in northeastern Estonia was becoming increasingly popular, but this was contradicted by polls showing 87% of the region's population opposed secession from Estonia. In 1993, dissatisfaction with newly enacted citizenship and election laws (non-citizens were not allowed to hold office) culminated in the Narva referendum of 16–17 July 1993, which proposed autonomy for Narva and Sillamäe, a nearby town. 97% voted in favor of the referendum, though turnout in Narva was 55% and there were credible charges of vote rigging. Russian residents nowadays <b>are</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> their status as Estonian citizens and live peacefully alongside their compatriots.|$|E
25|$|The {{rise of the}} {{minstrel}} show {{coincided with}} the growth of the abolitionist movement. Many Northerners were concerned for the oppressed blacks of the South, but most had no idea how these slaves lived day-to-day. Blackface performance had been inconsistent on this subject; some slaves were happy, others victims of a cruel and inhuman institution. However, in the 1850s minstrelsy became decidedly mean-spirited and pro-slavery as race replaced class as its main focus. Most minstrels projected a greatly romanticized and exaggerated image of black life with cheerful, simple slaves always ready to sing and dance and to please their masters. (Less frequently, the masters cruelly split up black lovers or sexually assaulted black women.) The lyrics and dialogue were generally racist, satiric, and largely white in origin. Songs about slaves yearning to return to their masters were plentiful. The message was clear: do not worry about the slaves; they <b>are</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> their lot in life. Figures like the Northern dandy and the homesick ex-slave reinforced the idea that blacks did not belong, nor did they want to belong, in Northern society.|$|E

A Hong Kong {{newspaper}} reported that Swire Pacific was in advanced negotiations that would see Cathay Pacific taking over Dragonair. This was dismissed outright by Tony Tyler, then {{chief operating officer of}} Cathay Pacific who said [...] "We have no plans to change that structure right now... we <b>are</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> the structure of the shareholding in Dragonair at the moment.

When asked whether adopted children would <b>be</b> <b>happier</b> <b>with</b> a Guatemalan family or with a foreign family, 55  % replied that they would <b>be</b> <b>happier</b> <b>with</b> a Guatemalan family and 37.1  % replied that they would <b>be</b> <b>happier</b> <b>with</b> a foreign family (Seijo 2008).|$|R

2500|$|Finally, a third theory {{suggests}} an {{emotional and behavioral}} tie between the purchaser and the product which drives both the likelihood of an impulsive purchase {{as well as the}} degree that a person will retroactively be satisfied with that purchase result. [...] Some studies have shown a large number of individuals <b>are</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> purchases made on impulse (41% in one study) which is explained as a preexisting emotional attachment which has a positive relationship both with the likelihood of initiating the purchase as well as mitigating post purchase satisfaction. [...] As an example, when purchasing team-related college paraphernalia a large percentage of those purchases are made on impulse and are tied to the degree with which a person has positive ties to that team.|$|E

60|$|One day, {{at a big}} dinner, he {{announced}} casually that the Directors had shifted on to him a Natural Curiosity, from England, in the Accountant line. He was perfectly correct. Mr. Silas Riley, Accountant, was a MOST curious animal--a long, gawky, rawboned Yorkshireman, full of the savage self-conceit that blossom's only in the best county in England. Arrogance was a mild word for the mental attitude of Mr. S. Riley. He had worked himself up, after seven years, to a Cashier's position in a Huddersfield Bank; and all his experience lay among the factories of the North. Perhaps {{he would have done}} better on the Bombay side, where they <b>are</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> one-half per cent. profits, and money is cheap.

6000|$|Yet Swedenborg, {{after his}} mode, pinned his theory to a {{temporary}} form. He exaggerates the circumstance of marriage; and, though he finds false marriages on the earth, fancies a wiser choice in heaven. But of progressive souls, all loves and friendships are momentary. Do you love me? means, Do {{you see the}} same truth? If you do, we <b>are</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> the same happiness; but presently one of us passes into the perception of new truth;--we are divorced, and no tension in nature can hold us to each other. I know how delicious is this cup of love,--I existing for you, you existing for me; {{but it is a}} child's clinging to his toy; an attempt to eternize the fireside and nuptial chamber; to keep the picture-alphabet through which our first lessons are prettily conveyed. The Eden of God is bare and grand: like the outdoor landscape, remembered from the evening fireside, it seems cold and desolate, whilst you cower over the coals; but, once abroad again, we pity those who can forego the magnificence of nature, for candle-light and cards. Perhaps the true subject of the [...] "Conjugal Love" [...] is conversation, whose laws are profoundly eliminated. It is false, if literally applied to marriage. For God is the bride or bridegroom of the soul. Heaven is not the pairing of two, but the communion of all souls. We meet, and dwell an instant under the temple of one thought, and part as though we parted not, to join another thought in other fellowships of joy. So far from there being anything divine in the low and proprietary sense of, Do you love me? it is only when you leave and lose me, by casting yourself on a sentiment which is higher than both of us, that I draw near, and find myself at your side; and I am repelled, if you fix your eye on me, and demand love. In fact, in the spiritual world, we change sexes every moment. You love the worth in me; then I am your husband: but it is not me, but the worth, that fixes the love; and that worth is a drop of the ocean of worth that is beyond me. Meantime, I adore the greater worth in another, and so become his wife. He aspires to a higher worth in another spirit, and is wife of receiver of that influence.|$|E
