There was a close correlation between the mechanical characteristics and the non-ideal storage time. Sensory evaluation showed significant ranking in “bite and chewing”, “sweet taste” and “global impression” attributes according to the Page test. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots were determined for the <b>acoustic</b> <b>stiffness</b> coefficient, cutting force and deformation work ratio and these showed that PC 1 followed a tendency {{similar to that of}} the storage time. PCA plots were determined for the electronic tongue measurements and this PCA separated the sample groups along PC 1 and PC 2. We used partial least square (PLS) regression to predict “bite and chewing” from the <b>acoustic</b> <b>stiffness</b> coefficient, cutting force, and deformation work ratio with an acceptable correlation. The “sweet taste” was predicted from the electronic tongue measurement results with good correlation.

40|$|Acute {{purulent}} {{otitis media}} and otitis media with effusion, are common diseases in childhood. Years later {{some of the}} children will get "complications", such as retraction pockets and cholesteatoma, that often need advanced surgical treatment. Our hypothesis is that already a short period of inflammatory middle ear disease can cause a loss of stiffness in the tympanic membrane. Such a stiffness loss may predispose for the late complications. In previous experimental studies, stiffness changes were shown to develop in the pars tensa of the tympanic membrane during otitis media. Retraction pockets are, however, often found in the pars flaccida, which differs greatly from the pars tensa regarding morphologic structure. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>stiffness</b> properties of the tympanic membrane were studied in early stages of experimental cholesteatoma in the gerbil. The measurements were performed with an invitro tympanometry model. The results showed an increased <b>acoustic</b> <b>stiffness.</b> This <b>acoustic</b> <b>stiffness</b> change was correlated to a pathological thickness increase of the tympanic membrane. The increase of <b>acoustic</b> <b>stiffness</b> contrasts to previous results showing a loss of mechanical stiffness in the same disease model. This difference emphasizes that acoustic and mechanical stiffness are governed by different structural properties. Awareness of this may be important searching for better surgical methods and materials in middle ear reconstruction. A projection moire interferometry model was designed in order to enable measurements of the mechanical stiffness of the pars flaccida in the gerbil. Moire interferometry is a noncontacting optical method with which the shape and displacement of an object can be measured. Peak displacement versus pressure was used as a measure of mechanical stiffness. The mechanical stiffness properties of the healthy pars flaccida {{as well as of the}} pars flaccida during purulent otitis media and otitis media with effusion were assessed. The border of the pars flaccida was almost circular and the displaced pars flaccida had the shape of a sphere cap. Therefore the volume displacement could be calculated as well. In the peak displacement measurements a loss of mechanical stiffness was assessed during purulent otitis media and otitis media with effusion already within a few days. This loss of stiffness may be persistent and may predispose for future retraction pocket formation and cholesteatoma development...|$|E

Two typical installations where a layer of porous material is placed next to a rigid wall, and where it is placed at a distance from a rigid wall are used as reference cases.

40|$|Because {{of surface}} roughness, {{the area of}} contact between real {{surfaces}} {{is less than the}} geometrical area. For this reason the known rules of acoustic reflection and transmission have to be modified for real interfaces. Ultrasonic transmission through imperfect interfaces is commonly described in terms of the contact stiffness model which assumes distributed springs between the surfaces in contact [Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 202 244; J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 89 (1991) 503 ff; J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 68 1516; J. Nondestr. Eval. 4 177; J. Geophys. Res. 94 (1989) 17681 ff]. Several authors [Trans. ASME 123 8 ff; J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 103 657 ff; Ultrasonics 38 513] theoretically and experimentally show the pressure and frequency dependence of the ultrasonic transmission through such interfaces. Our paper will document, that the temperature of the interface has significant influence on the ultrasonic transmission as well. In the experimental approach, a CuSn 8 -rod was clamped between the electrodes of a resistance welding unit. Either longitudinally or transversally polarised ultrasonic pulses were generated by a transmitter built in the upper electrode. The transmitted ultrasonic signal was subsequently detected by the receiver integrated in the lower electrode. After the welding current was turned on, a strong decrease in ultrasonic transmission has been observed due to resistance heating of the interfaces between the welding electrodes and the rod. To explain this extraordinary strong temperature effect, a simple quasistatic analytical thermal–electrical model of the contacting area was used to give a rough estimation of the maximum interfacial temperature and the temperature distribution during the flow of the welding current. In a second step, the temperature dependence of the material data in the <b>acoustic</b> contact <b>stiffness</b> model was used to calculate the changes in ultrasonic transmission caused by the welding current. It is shown, that the observed decrease in ultrasonic transmission with increasing temperature is mainly caused by the temperature dependence of the elastic constants of the metals and is much stronger than expected for ideal interfaces. The calculated ultrasonic transmission is in very good agreement with the experimental data and seems to be interpreted correctly by the <b>acoustic</b> contact <b>stiffness</b> model...|$|R

The amplitude of surface waves above the cavity is observed to vary with the slope of variation of the L-dependent acoustic radiation pressure exerted on the liquid surface, i. e. with the <b>acoustic</b> spring <b>stiffness.</b> The observed simultaneous back-scattering of these surface waves demonstrates that the surface response to the cavity length variations results mainly in an added stiffness, i. e., in an increase of the real part of the surface impedance above the cavity.

40|$|Bruise {{prediction}} {{models for}} tomatoes are discussed. These models can provide useful {{information about the}} influence of fruit properties (for example ripeness) on bruise susceptibility, leading to recommendations for fruit handling. Statistical models were constructed with impact energy or peak contact force as the main independent variable. Bruise prediction models were made for tomato cultivar 'Tradiro'. The impacts were controlled by a pendulum. Multiple linear and nonlinear regression models were made to link fruit properties like ripeness, <b>acoustic</b> <b>stiffness,</b> fruit temperature, radius of curvature and location of impact (partition or compartment of tomato) with bruise damage. Because an objective method to measure the bruise size of tomatoes does not exist, absorbed energy was taken as a measure. Besides significant main effects significant interactions between fruit properties were also identified. Mutual interactions between fruit properties (for example interaction between radius of curvature and temperature) together with significant interactions between some fruit properties and the degree of bruising were noticed.

Correlations between the compressive strength and the sonic velocity were highest in the marble (0. 94 - 0. 97), and lowest in the granite (0. 68).

However, there appear to be large discrepancies between texture measurements obtained by these different techniques. This research is aimed at evaluating the relationship between several well-known texture measurement techniques. Apple fruits of two cultivars, Jonagold and Kanzi (different softening behaviour) were harvested at commercial maturity, stored at 1 or 4 °C under optimal controlled atmosphere conditions, at high or low relative humidity. At the end of 6 months storage, the fruits were placed under shelf life conditions for 3 weeks, during which texture and weight loss were measured. Furthermore, texture measurements were compared with changes in the water soluble pectin (WSP) fraction, cell morphology and loss in cell turgor potentials. The <b>acoustic</b> firmness (<b>stiffness)</b> decreased throughout storage and shelf life. However, the firmness obtained by the Magness Taylor puncture test increased during the first week of shelf life exposure. Further analysis of the force-deformation curves at this time point showed that failure was possibly due to cell separation, rather than cell breakage. Textural changes in apples seems to be governed principally by pectin degradation (evident by increased in WSP) and moisture losses.

Instrumental measures used were Magness-Taylor penetrometer readings, stiffness by acoustic resonance, and a range of sensory descriptors assessed by a trained panel.

Storage Time Equivalent Value (STEV) was calculated and introduced based on mass-loss analysis. The changes of the non-destructive parameters were analyzed vs. this virtual storage time (STEV).

The work in this thesis examines the structural-acoustic interaction problem within enclosures using both analytical and numerical solutions. The analytical solutions for the noise generated within a uniform linear duct and a three-dimensional rectangular cavity are given. It is shown how the acoustic field inside the linear duct could be controlled by altering the boundary conditions. This gives {{a basic understanding of}} the interaction problem and of the measures available in the much more complex case of vehicle noise control to reduce or avoid boom problems. An analytical solution for the acoustic pressure within a closed rectangular cavity with one flexible simply supported panel is given. The results of this analysis are used to find the effect, in terms of <b>acoustic</b> <b>stiffness,</b> of such a backing cavity on panel vibration. Both the acoustic field and the structure are analysed. It is shown that using mobility measurement as input data to the acoustic analysis gives better results than using structural analysis.

An efficient and accurate computer program has been developed and tested on a variety of enclosures. The code is written in FORTRAN and uses the Boundary Element Method as the analysis tool to calculate the interior sound level in a volume surrounded by boundaries of arbitrary shape. The input data required for the numerical model are a surface mesh of boundary elements and the vibrational data on the surface. The vibrational data in this thesis are obtained from mobility measurements. The acoustic field is then modelled by the Boundary Element Method.

MethodsFive groups of rabbits of various ages (3 weeks, 8 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2. 5 years) consisting of five rabbits per group were examined. Signal intensity (index of stiffness), signal duration (index of surface irregularity) and interval between signals (index of thickness) of the ultrasound reflection from articular cartilage were examined at four sites: posterior lateral femoral condyle, posterior medial femoral condyle, lateral tibial plateau, and medial tibial plateau. The sites were observed macroscopically and microscopically with a light microscope and a polarized light microscope. ResultsAt the lateral and medial condyles and the lateral tibial plateau, signal intensity was least in 3 -week-old specimens. The intensity increased until 6 months or 1 year of age. At these sites, the signal durations and intervals between signals were least at the ages of 6 months or 1 year. At the medial tibial plateau, the intensity was the least at 2. 5 years of age and the interval between signals was least at 3 weeks of age; there was no effect of age on signal duration. Cartilage surfaces of all specimens were smooth and no degenerative changes were macroscopically or microscopically evident.

40|$|Texture is an {{important}} quality parameter in fresh horticultural products. However, its complexity and variability entails that instrumental analyses describe it only partial whereas various properties are involved. For example, product water status, cell wall physical properties and tissue structure interdependently determine compressive and tensile strength, and elastic properties, which all together characterise texture. Furthermore, short-term effects on texture under unfavourable conditions during shelf five may be functionally different from those occurring during long-term storage. During recent years, new methods such as the acoustic impulse-response technique have become available to non-destructively analyse the elastic texture components. In addition, water potential, osmotic potential and turgor can be non-destructively assessed with the pressure bomb in combination with pressure volume analyses in many products. An experiment was designed to comprehensively {{study the effects of}} water status on different tissue elastic parameters. Water potential (Psi), fresh mass, apparent elastic modulus (E, quasi-static compression test), and stiffness factor (S, acoustic impulse-response test) were repeatedly determined on radish tubers during desiccation by free transpiration. E showed a two-phased linear relationship with Psi. At water potentials beyond the turgor-loss-region, the slope of this relationship largely declined. In turgescent tubers a considerable part of the variation of E could be explained by water potential. S showed a less clear two-phased relation and wilting seems to exhibit only minor effects on stiffness. Both E and S increased linearly with pressure potential but S showed a weaker correlation with turgor. While the decline in <b>acoustic</b> <b>stiffness</b> with increasing relative water deficit seemed to follow an exponential model, the correlation between E and RWD could be best described by a power function. E and S increased with increasing volumetric modulus of elasticity (epsilon) in a curvilinear manner. When E and S were compared directly, a curvilinear correlation was found. These results show that S is a good indicator for changes in produce water content. Both parameters are useful to indicate postharvest texture changes.

40|$|Introduction: Some {{forces and}} impacts that occur during {{transporting}} and handling {{can reduce the}} apricot quality. Bruise damage is {{a major cause of}} fruit quality loss. Bruises occur under dynamic and static loading when stress induced in the fruit exceeds the failure stress of the fruit tissue. Needless to say that physical and mechanical properties of fruits in the design and optimization of systems related to production, processing and packaging of the products are important. Harvesting, transport, packaging and transportation of fruits and vegetables, result in their bruising which can cause loss of marketability of the fruit by consumers. The term of ‘absorbed energy’ could be used to express the quantity of damage done on the fruit and the high the absorbed energy, the higher the damage on the fruit. The object of this research was due to the importance of apricot fruit and lack of information about the mechanical behavior. Materials and Methods: In this study, apricot fruit variety “Ziaolmolki” was examined to determine some physical and mechanical properties. In order avoid any damage, the fruits were carefully harvested from trees and gathered in plastic boxes in a row, to prevent damage to the apricots. For determination of mechanical properties and levels of impact energy used test axial machine and pendulum device, respectively. Dependent variables (acoustics stiffness, radius of curvature, color characteristic a* and b*, Brix percentage, penetration force, penetration work and penetration deformation) and independent variables (impact energy in three levels, temperature and color in 2 levels each) were selected and analyzed by block designs with factorial structure. In the experimental design, the fruits were stored in two temperature levels, 3 oC and 25 oC. Two areas of any fruit (red and yellow areas) were subjected to 3 impact energy levels. For each of the 8 levels, 8 fruit samples were selected. Overall, 96 fruits 8 (number of fruit per level) × 3 (impact energy level) × 2 (both red and yellow) × 2 (at 25 oC and 3 oC) was selected. In this study, using a factorial experiment in a completely randomized design, the effect of different factors (impact energy in 3 levels, temperature in 2 levels 3 oC and 25 °C and color in 2 levels red and yellow) on <b>acoustic</b> <b>stiffness,</b> radius of curvature, color characteristic a* and b*, precent Brix, penetration force, penetration work and penetration deformation in apricot under the quasi-static forces were studied. In order to conduct this experiment, the universal testing machine of biological materials was used. After the determination of mechanical properties of the products, the SAS statistical program (1. 9) was applied to analyze and normalize the resulted data. Factorial test also was used {{to determine the effects of}} independent variables on the dependent variables. Data analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SAS version 19. 0). The variance analysis of the data was conducted in the form of multivariate factorial (2 × 2 × 3) design.

The additive and non-additive variances were calculated {{separately from the}} total genetic variances in C. citriodora subsp. variegata clonal trials to allow the estimation of broad- and narrow- sense heritabilities. Efficient selection strategies using selection indices are also presented in discussion section. For C. citriodora subsp. variegata clonal trials, Quambalaria shoot blight damage at the ages of 1. 0 - 1. 7 years and 3. 5 - 3. 8 years was under predominantly non-additive genetic control (H 2 = 0. 02 - 0. 46, h 2 = 0 - 0. 17). Growth traits were, overall, under moderate genetic control (H 2 = 0. 32 - 0. 54, h 2 = 0 - 0. 54). For tree height, nearly 100 % of the genetic variances were contributed by the non-additive component. For diameter at breast height and individual tree volume, the dominant genetic variances were non-additive (66 - 80 %) at the Coffs Harbour and Grafton sites, whilst the additive variances (88 - 100 %) became dominant at the other two sites. Bark thickness and percentage (H 2 = 0. 45 - 0. 81) and non-destructive wood properties (H 2 = 0. 57 - 0. 87) were under moderate to high genetic control, with 45 - 100 % of the genetic variances being additive for bark traits and basic density and 76 - 100 % of the genetic variances being non-additive for <b>acoustic</b> <b>stiffness</b> (represented by acoustic velocity squared). Growth traits were strongly correlated with Quambalaria damage, especially for the second assessment (rg = 0. 53 - 0. 85). Correlations between growth and bark traits showed that larger trees tended to have thicker bark (rg = 0. 50 - 0. 79), but did not necessarily have higher bark proportion (rg = - 0. 48 to 0. 26). There was no significant relationship between growth traits and wood properties (Pilodyn penetration, basic density or acoustic velocity squared), but strongly negative correlations between Pilodyn penetration and acoustic velocity squared (rg = - 0. 76 to - 0. 53). Basic density and Pilodyn penetration were highly negatively correlated (rg = - 0. 95 to - 1. 00). Low across-site correlations for Quambalaria damage (rg = 0. 13 - 1. 00) were observed, indicating genotype by environment interactions (GEIs) occurred. Across-site correlations for growth traits were reasonably high, with most estimates above 0. 8. Relatively lower correlations (under 0. 7), however, were also found between some pairs of sites. These lower correlations for growth traits were {{probably due to the}} disease effects or due to some degree of GEL By contrast, across-site correlations for wood properties (rg = 0. 84 - 0. 99) and bark traits (rg = 0. 83 - 0. 96) were notably high, especially those for basic density, indicating no significant GEI. For E. urophylla progeny trials, growth traits (h 2 = 0. 05 - 0. 39) were under low to moderate additive genetic control, whereas bark traits (h 2 = 0. 22 - 0. 38) and wood properties (h 2 = 0. 35 - 0. 66) were under moderate to strong additive genetic control. Narrow-sense heritabilities for growth traits and basic density appeared to decrease over generations. The larger trees tended to have thicker bark (rg = 0. 48 to 0. 57) but did not necessarily have higher bark percentage (rg = - 0. 40 to 0. 32). Correlations between growth traits and basic density (say diameter at breast height and Pilodyn penetration) were favourable strong in the first generation (rg = 0. 26 and 0. 48) but were not significantly different from zero in the second generation (rg = - 0. 06 and 0. 20). There was strong negative correlation (rg = - 1. 00) between basic density and Pilodyn penetration. Acoustic velocity squared was highly positively correlated with basic density (rg = 0. 63) (except Pilodyn penetration, rg = - 0. 04) and growth traits (rg = 0. 49 - 0. 63). Across-site correlation for diameter at breast height within the inland Dongmen region (rg = 0. 81) indicated that there was no GEI. However, GEIs for growth traits were significant between Dongmen and Shankou (rg = 0. 37 - 0. 79). No GEI for basic density was present either within the Dongmen region (rg = 1. 00) or between Dongmen and Shankou (rg = 0. 99). Traits with higher heritabilities (e. g. wood property traits) in the first generation had higher across-generation correlations (rg = 0. 63 - 1. 00). On the contrary, traits with lower heritabilities (e. g. growth traits) had lower across-generation correlations (rg = - 0. 26 to 0. 83). The estimates of across-generation correlations between Dongmen and Shankou obtained in this study were somewhat lower, indicating some degree of GEI...|$|E

Current efforts {{have moved to}} <b>acoustic</b> screening for <b>stiffness</b> at similar age. Breeding cycles are still too long. An alternative is to screen out the worst trees even earlier: shorter breeding cycles should outweigh the lower accuracy due to early selection. Besides genetic effects, {{there is also evidence}} that wood stiffness is affected by wind, particularly for stands with low stocking and trees in forest margins. A glasshouse experiment was setup for early selection considering two factors: tree position and clone. Tree positions were straight (control), leaning (30 ° from the vertical) and rocked (15 minutes every hour, simulating 10 km h- 1 wind). Four clones were used covering a range of wood stiffness and replication was 12 plants per treatment. The response variables at 8 months were squared acoustic velocity (v 2, surrogate of stiffness), basic density, collar diameter, diameter asymmetry and compression wood. There were significant differences of v 2 for treatments and clones.

40|$|Flat panel {{speakers}} {{are characterized}} by its low manufactured depth. Compared with conventional loudspeakers the space saving integration in existing surroundings is an advantage. From the acoustics point of view disadvantages come along with the low manufactured depth that influence the reproduction in the lower and middle frequency range. Based on measurements and FEM-simulations {{the reasons for this}} behavior were analyzed. Supplementary methods for solving this problem have been considered that are derived from conventional loudspeaker technologies. It has been shown that the advantage of flat panel speakers mounted next to a wall or other sound hard boundaries caused sound radiation problems. In case of flat panel speakers, mounting in a baffle or an enclosure can be a solution. But due to <b>acoustic</b> short-circuit and <b>stiffness</b> of the air volume inside an enclosure unwieldy large baffle or cabinet dimensions are necessary. Furthermore simulation and measurement results show that the stiffness of the air spring seems to be independent on the enclosure shape. The air spring of flat enclosures are comparable to the air spring of non-flat enclosures with the same volume. But the flat enclosures have to be very broad to offer the same air volume like an conventional enclosure. Otherwise, the resonance frequency and thus the lower cutoff frequency will be increased. Therefore approaches to handle or reduce the air stiffness of small enclosures have to be further investigated...|$|R

To select high stiffness radiata pine for breeding purpose, rapid, inexpensive methods for measuring wood stiffness are desirable. In this study, we explored acoustic instruments to measure stiffness of young standing trees in radiata pine and examined inheritance and genetic gain for stiffness in an Australian national breeding program. Time of flight of sound waves was recorded in standing trees in two progeny trials, one in eastern Victoria (Flynn) aged 8 years and the other in South Australia (Kromelite) aged 7 years. Average time of flight at Kromelite was higher than at Flynn, (519 µs/metre compared to 463 µs/metre) which corresponds to 3. 7 GPa and 4. 7 GPa for MoE, respectively. Heritability for time of flight was higher at Flynn (h 2 = 0. 67 ± 0. 10) than at Kromelite (h 2 = 0. 30 ± 0. 14). Selection of the best 10 % for time of flight based on pooled data would result in 21 % genetic gain in wood stiffness.

Characteristics of these processes evaluated numerically, in comparison with experimental results, could allow to simulate complex structural processes taking place during fatigue and ageing degradation of composite. It is expected to prove relations between chosen physical properties of simulated processes and strength characteristics determining load capacity of materials. Design/methodology/approach: Planar, biphase model of fibre reinforced laminate was applied. Pseudo-random procedure of model structure and physical parameters modification was used. A programme of numerical simulations was performed to evaluate sensitivity of characteristics of acoustic wave propagation and heat transport processes on model modifications. Findings: Possibility of model structural and parametric modifications resulting in changes of composite physical properties, such as <b>stiffness,</b> <b>acoustic</b> wave propagation velocity and thermal conductivity, observed during degradation processes was demonstrated. Research limitations/implications: It is expected that results of composite testing programme, being now realized by authors, will allow quantitative adjustment of acoustic and thermal characteristics achieved numerically and experimentally.

40|$|Malignant or benign tumors may be ablated with high‐intensity focused {{ultrasound}} (HIFU). This technique, {{known as}} focused ultrasound surgery (FUS), has been actively investigated for decades, but slow {{to be implemented}} and difficult to control {{due to lack of}} real‐time feedback during ablation. Two methods of imaging and monitoring HIFU lesions during formation were implemented simultaneously, in order to investigate the efficacy of each and to increase confidence in the detection of the lesion. The first, Acousto‐Optic Imaging (AOI) detects the increasing optical absorption and scattering in the lesion. The intensity of a diffuse optical field in illuminated tissue is mapped at the spatial resolution of an ultrasound focal spot, using the acousto‐optic effect. The second, Harmonic Motion Imaging (HMI), detects the changing stiffness in the lesion. The HIFU beam is modulated to force oscillatory motion in the tissue, and the amplitude of this motion, measured by ultrasound pulse‐echo techniques, is influenced by the stiffness. Experiments were performed on store‐bought chicken breast and freshly slaughtered bovine liver. The AOI results correlated with the onset and relative size of forming lesions much better than prior knowledge of the HIFU power and duration. For HMI, a significant artifact was discovered due to acoustic nonlinearity. The artifact was mitigated by adjusting the phase of the HIFU and imaging pulses. A more detailed model of the HMI process than previously published was made using finite element analysis. The model showed that the amplitude of harmonic motion was primarily affected by increases in <b>acoustic</b> attenuation and <b>stiffness</b> as the lesion formed and the interaction of these effects was complex and often counteracted each other. Further biological variability in tissue properties meant that changes in motion were masked by sample‐to‐sample variation. The HMI experiments predicted lesion formation in only {{about a quarter of the}} lesions made. In simultaneous AOI/HMI experiments it appeared that AOI was a more robust method for lesion detection.

It is well recognized that measuring wood properties of logs in real time during harvesting would lead to improved log allocation decisions and increased value recovery. Wood stiffness {{is certainly one of}} the attributes defining the quality of forest products such as veneer and lumber. Accurately assessing stiffness in realtime can be a challenge for log supply managers requiring logs segregated into different product classes based on <b>stiffness.</b> <b>Acoustic</b> technology {{has proven to be a}} well established non-destructive technique for assessing potential product performance by identifying logs with high stiffness. Launched by the worldwide trend towards increased mechanization of forest harvesting operations, providing a platform for innovative measurement systems, the interest in incorporating technologies for measuring internal stem features into a harvester head is rapidly growing. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to provide forest products stakeholders with comprehensive scientific information on the potential capabilities, limitations, and applicability of acoustic technology to improve value recovery from Douglas-fir stands by means of in-forest sorting of veneer quality logs. This dissertation: • Demonstrated that recovery of high quality green veneer from Douglas-fir peeler logs could be accurately predicted using resonance-based acoustic velocity measurements, • modeled the predictive capabilities of spatial as well as internal and external log and tree characteristics in terms of veneer quality and analyzed their effects on acoustic velocity measurements of Douglas-fir wood stiffness, • determined whether time of flight acoustic technology could be used for pre-harvest veneer quality assessment of Douglas-fir stands in terms of stiffness requirements, • described influential factors arising from incorporating acoustic instruments on a mechanized harvester head and suggested optimal procedures for scanning in terms of feasibility and harvester productivity, • presented a general methodology to estimate breakeven prices of Douglasfir peeler logs based on the net return obtained when logs from stiffness graded stands using acoustic technology are processed and converted into end products...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{aimed at}} {{studying}} {{the potential of}} two nondestructive methods to estimate the wood mechanical properties and mass loss due to thermal treatments. In this study, a low-density tropical hardwood species Simarouba amara (marupá) was used. Forty small beams with dimensions of (25 × 25 × 400)  mm (width × thickness × length) were cut from this species. Initially, the beams were nondestructively tested using stress wave and ultrasound methods. Stress wave velocity (Swv), ultrasound velocity (V LL), dynamic modulus of elasticity (E d) and stiffness coefficient (C LL) were longitudinally determined. Afterwards, the beams were thermally treated using a chamber without air circulation under atmospheric pressure. Two schedules were tested: 160 ºC for 180 minutes and 200 ºC for 70 minutes. Mass loss (ML) due to thermal treatment was calculated and the thermally treated material was again nondestructively evaluated. Afterwards, modulus of rupture (f m), modulus of elasticity (E M) and parallel compression strength (f c, 0) of treated material were assessed. Backward linear multiple regression analysis was run in order to estimate these properties. Parameters investigated through nondestructive testing (before and after treatment) and derivative variables were used as independent variables, totaling 12 variables. For both treatment schedules, all parameters related to nondestructive techniques were affected by the thermal treatment, thus <b>acoustic</b> velocities and <b>stiffness</b> values were improved. It was found that all evaluated properties of treated material could be modeled at a reasonable level (R 2 =  0. 392 to 0. 874) depending on the nondestructive method and treatment schedule used. Nevertheless, ultrasound method fitted the most suitable models for {{a large number of}} properties. The utilization of variables from both methods together yielded better models whose R 2 value ranged from 0. 466 (f m) to 0. 941 (E M). It was found that the most important nondestructive variables which entered into the models were: Swv before and after treatment, V LL after treatment, E d before treatment and C LL after treatment. Finally, it could be concluded that stress wave and ultrasound nondestructive methods presented great potential to evaluate properties of thermally treated wood material. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death for {{developed}} countries, including the United States. In order to diagnose and detect certain cardiac diseases, it is necessary to assess myocardial performance and function. One mechanical property that has been shown to reflect myocardial performance is myocardial <b>stiffness.</b> <b>Acoustic</b> radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging has been demonstrated to be capable of visualizing variations in local stiffness within soft tissue. In this thesis, the initial investigations into the visualization of myocardial performance with ARFI imaging are presented. In vivo ARFI images were acquired with a linear array placed on exposed canine hearts. When co-registered with the electrocardiogram (ECG), ARFI images of the heart reflected the expected changes in myocardial stiffness through the cardiac cycle. With the implementation of a quadratic motion filter, motion artifacts within the ARFI images were reduced to below 1. 5 &mu m at all points of the cardiac cycle. The inclusion of pre-excitation displacement estimates in the quadratic motion filter further reduced physiological motion artifacts at all points of the cardiac cycle to below 0. 5 &mu m. In order for cardiac ARFI imaging to more quantitatively assess myocardial performance, novel ARFI imaging sequences and methods were developed to address challenges specifically related to cardiac imaging. These improvements provided finer sampling and improved spatial and temporal resolution within the ARFI images. In vivo epicardial ARFI images of an ovine heart were formed using these sequences, and the quality and utility of the resultant ARFI-induced displacement curves were examined. In vivo cardiac ARFI images were formed of canine left ventricular free walls while the hearts were externally paced by one of two electrodes positioned epicardially on either side of the imaging plane. Directions and speeds of myocardial stiffness propagation were measured within the ARFI imaging field of view. In all images, the myocardial stiffness waves were seen to be traveling away from the stimulating electrode. The stiffness propagation velocities were also shown to be consistent with propagation velocities measured from elastography and tissue velocity imaging as well as the local epicardial ECG. ARFI-induced displacement curves of an ovine heart were formed and temporally registered with left ventricular pressure and volume measurements. From these plots, the synchronization of myocardial stiffening and relaxation with the four phases (isovolumic contraction, ejection, isovolumic relaxation, and filling) of the cardiac cycle was determined. These ARFI imaging sequences were also used to correlate changes in left ventricular performance with changes in myocardial stiffness. These preliminary results indicated that changes in the ARFI imaging-derived stiffnesses were consistent with those predicted by current, clinically accepted theories of myocardial performance and function. These results demonstrate the ability of ARFI imaging to visualize changes in myocardial stiffness through the cardiac cycle and its feasibility to provide clinically useful insight into myocardial performance.
