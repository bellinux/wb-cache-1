40|$|Atomobile {{evaporative}} emission canisters contain <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> sorbents that <b>trap</b> and store fuel vapors emitted from automobile fuel tanks {{during periods of}} hot ambient temperatures and after engine operation. When a vehicle is started, combustion air is pulled through the canister, and adsorbed vapors are removed from the sorbent and routed to the intake manifold for combustion along with fuel from the tank. The two primary requirements of an effective canister sorbent are that (1) {{it must be a}} strong enough adsorbent {{to hold on to the}} fuel vapors that contact it and (2) it must be a weak enough adsorbent to release the captured vapors in the presence of the airflow required by the engine for fuel combustion. Most currently available commercial canister sorbents are made from wood, which is reacted with phosphoric acid and heat to yield an <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> with optimum pore size for gasoline vapor adsorption. The objectives of Task 5. 7 were to (1) design and construct a test system for evaluating the performance of different sorbents in trapping and releasing butane, gasoline, and other organic vapors; (2) investigate the use of lignite char as an automobile fuel evaporation canister sorbent; (3) compare the adsorbing and desorbing characteristics of lignite chars with those of several commercial sorbents; and (4) investigate whether the presence of ethanol in fuel vapors affects sorbent performance in any way. Tests with two different sorbents (a wood-derived <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> and a lignite char) showed that with both sorbents, ethanol vapor breakthrough took about twice as long as hydrocarbon vapor breakthrough. Possible reasons for this, including an increased sorbent affinity for ethanol vapors, will be investigated.

40|$|A {{composite}} of γ-alumina and <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> made of cassava peels was studied {{in terms of}} its pore structures and its properties. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the interaction and structure, as well as the character and pore size of γ-alumina – <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> composite. Carbon made of cassava peels was activated by H 2 SO 4 and its activities were tested according to the Indonesian Industrial Standards (SII). The addition of <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> into γ-alumina made in variations of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 % w/w, of the total weight of 10 grams. The {{composite of}} γ-alumina - <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> was characterized by FTIR, SAA (Surface Area Analyzer), XRD, and determination of Hysteresis Loop composites. The greater addition of <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> to γ-alumina causes intermolecular interactions between –O-H groups form rehydrated hydrogen bonds in the composite is greater. The structure of γ-alumina in the composites remain intact although the percentage of <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> in composite is large. The total pore volume and surface area using the BET method of the composite decreases with increasing <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> percentage. The greater addition of <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> to γ-alumina causes size of mesoporous composites decreased with the characteristic of a composite formed is closer to the <b>activated</b> <b>carbon...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} develop {{biomaterials}} useful in reconstructive surgery, mechanism of adsorption of chitosan onto <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> has been investigated. <b>Activated</b> <b>carbons</b> have been characterised using SEM, NH 3 adsorption and 129 Xe NMR spectroscopy. Adsorption of chitosan on <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> in acid aqueous solution increases when the degree of acetylation of chitosan decreases. Sterilization does not modify the adsorption capacity of the studied sample of <b>activated</b> <b>carbon...</b>|$|R
30|$|Decolourization {{process of}} {{neutralized}} sunflower oil {{was carried out}} with <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> products obtained from pyrolysis liquid products. The effect of parameters such as time, temperature, moisture and dosage on bleaching sunflower oil was investigated. It was found that <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> samples are an effective adsorbent for decolourization process of sunflower oil. It was determined that the ability of adsorption of the <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> samples at 20  °C temperature is {{higher than that of}} the bleaching earth which is used for this purpose. The analysis results directly prove that <b>activated</b> <b>carbons</b> remove the unwanted pigments and residues from sunflower oil. Moreover, <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> sample A 2 has a more positive effect on pigment removal than other <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> samples (A 1 and A 3). 1 % of <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> sample A 2, 0.01 % sunflower oil moisture, 20  °C temperature and 30  min contact time are optimal values in a sunflower oil bleaching process. Therefore, these <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> samples can be used to bleach sunflower oil instead of bleaching earth.|$|R
40|$|Coconut shell {{was used}} as a {{precursor}} for the production of <b>activated</b> <b>carbon.</b> The substrate was initially physically activated for determination of optimum temperature of production. However on comparison with various chemical activations, zinc chloride activation produced the best results. Preliminary tests determine the inefficiency of epoxy resins as binders. Later concentrated sugarcane juice {{was used as}} an adhesive for pellet formation. On activation of these pellets, enhanced surface properties (better than powder <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> using same procedures) are obtained. The characteristics of the pellet <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> were studied through various tests and analysis. The iodine number of the pellet <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> was determined to be 1100 mg/g and had a yield of 36. 95 %. However the powder <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> had an iodine number of only 1020 mg/g. The adsorption study of the pellet <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> hence provides evidence for better activity and surface area than commercial <b>activated</b> <b>carbon.</b> It also determines a suitable application of Methane gas storage by adsorption on this pellet <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> at high pressure...|$|R
40|$|The adsorptive {{characteristics}} of imidacloprid on magnetic <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> (MAC 12) {{in comparison to}} powdered <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> (PAC) were investigated. Adsorption of imidacloprid onto powdered <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> and magnetic <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> was studied {{as a function of}} time, initial imidacloprid concentration, temperature and pH. Pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and intraparticle diffusion models for both carbons were used to describe the kinetic data. The adsorption equilibrium data were analyzed using the Langmuir and Freundlich models. For powdered <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> the isotherm was ‘H’ type, and ‘L’ type for magnetic <b>activated</b> <b>carbon.</b> Equilibrium data fits well to the Langmuir model in the studied concentration range of imidacloprid. It was found that both the boundary layer and intraparticle diffusion for both adsorbents {{play an important role in}} the adsorption mechanisms of imidacloprid. The adsorption of imidacloprid on PAC and MAC 12 followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model rather than pseudo-first-order model. A decrease in the adsorption of imidacloprid on powdered <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> and magnetic <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> was observed with the increase in temperature. The pH of the solutions had no effect on the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents...|$|R
40|$|The <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> is {{the best}} {{absorbent}} for the absorptive treatment of the volatility organic compound content emission gas. However, the <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> is pertinent to a specified combustible by Fire Defense Law. As for the <b>activated</b> <b>carbon,</b> usage restrictions are set to the absorptive treatment of the volatility organic compound content emission gas for that. Then, the compound was tried by physically doing the mixture granulation expecting the synergy effect of the <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> and silicagel. As a result, the mixture ratio of the <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> and silicagel indicated {{and the amount of}} the impregnation of silicagel indicated the maximum value by 1 : 0. 4. And, the adsorption character of the obtained <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> compound absorbent clarified dependence on the particle diameter of silicagel. Moreover, the efficiency of twice the <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> was obtained in the processing of ethyl acetate content gas emission by vacuum pressure swing adsorption method...|$|R
