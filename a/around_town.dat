5|$|After {{finding out}} that Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) was flashed in the parking lot, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens an investigation. He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to {{interview}} Phyllis and make a sketch of the flasher. However, Phyllis says she didn't {{get a good look}} at him, so Pam instead draws a picture of Dwight with a mustache and without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) assists (who also seems to notice that the sketch looks similar to Dwight) an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it <b>around</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bart's House of Weirdness is an action-adventure-strategy {{platform}} {{game that}} uses single-screen movement. The plot sees Bart grounded {{to his room}} by his parents Homer and Marge after having pulled one too many pranks. With nothing to do, he quickly gets bored and escapes from the home. He travels <b>around</b> <b>town,</b> and eventually heads to an amusement park where he has to save Krusty the Clown from his archenemy Sideshow Bob.|$|E
5|$|Khánh {{flew into}} Saigon after Wilson's confirmation, and {{stayed at the}} house of a friend and waited for the coup, which was {{scheduled}} the coup for 04:00 January 30. According to the plan, Khiêm's forces in Saigon would surround the homes of the sleeping junta members while Khánh and a paratrooper unit would occupy the Joint General Staff headquarters near Tan Son Nhut Air Base. Thi followed Khánh to the capital on the same day, and the plotters met in obscure places <b>around</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ort's Oldies, a used {{record store}} on Jackson Street, and its proprietor, William Orten Carlton, {{commonly}} known as Ort, were among the institutional figures that made the Athens music scene possible. Ort has an excellent memory for rock trivia, which served him well in running the store. Perhaps more importantly, his off-the-wall {{sense of humor and}} warmly iconoclastic personality (and his thrift-sale wardrobe) were regularly on display at parties, gigs and musical venues <b>around</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E
5|$|Popotan {{takes place}} in the distant future within the {{remnants}} of Tokyo, destroyed by a cataclysm and since altered by geological transformations. The disaster was caused by a giant dandelion structure resembling a spire that arose in the city atop a hill. The main location of the game is a European-style mansion, seen as completely out-of-place in the city. Much of the daytime is spent outside the mansion wandering <b>around</b> <b>town</b> meeting characters and triggering event sequences.|$|E
5|$|Although Faversham Abbey was {{dissolved}} by Henry VIII {{the nearby}} St Mary of Charity, Faversham Parish Church remains, {{and has been}} a Grade I listed building since 1950. The church was established in 1147 by King Stephen and Queen Matilda, with a distinctive spire added around 1794 – 97 that can be easily seen from many places <b>around</b> <b>town.</b> The interior was restored in the mid-19th century by the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott, who redesigned the nave and transepts and added a stone encasing to the spire. The church reputedly contains the remains of King Stephen, which were recovered from Faversham Creek after the dissolution of the abbey. The church holds an altar dedicated to Saints Crispin and Crispinian, who reportedly fled to Faversham in the 3rd century.|$|E

5|$|Coleman {{hired the}} Portland company Sandstrom Design {{to help with}} marketing. Sandstrom helped to improve the promotional {{materials}} of the organization, while Portland Center Stage modified the nature and style of its performances. Sandstrom Design produced a 56-page flyer that showed the performance schedule for the 2003–2004 season which was mailed to subscribers, potential customers, handed out at performances and placed <b>around</b> <b>town.</b> The promotional campaign stressed the unique qualities of a live theater performance as entertainment over television and film. PCS's productions were presented in the Winningstad and Newmark theatres in Portland through the 2005–2006 season. Portland Center Stage moved to the new Gerding Theater at the Armory beginning with the 2006–2007 season.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, Mike meets up {{with his}} friends, the Terenzi {{brothers}} (Michael Siegel and Peter Licassi), and using the intercom on an ice cream truck, they drive <b>around</b> <b>town</b> attempting to warn people of the invading klowns. At Debbie's house, popcorn stuck to her clothes from her earlier encounter with the klowns mutates into monsters and attack her. She fends off the creatures, but another group of klowns arrive and trap her in a giant balloon. Mike, Dave, and the Terenzis witness Debbie's capture and give chase, following the klowns to an amusement park, and the relocated circus tent. Journeying through a funhouse leading to the klowns' lair, the Terenzi brothers become separated and meet two female-looking klowns. After Dave and Mike witness a klown using a crazy straw to drink liquefied townspeople, they rescue Debbie and flee into a maze full of tricks and traps.|$|E
5|$|Hit & Run {{has seven}} levels, each with {{missions}} and sub-plot. The player can control one specific character in each level. The game's playable characters are Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge, and Apu. Homer and Bart are played twice. When travelling on foot, the player character can walk, run, and perform {{three types of}} melee attacks: a normal kick, a jumping kick, and a smashing move. To drive, the player can either commandeer {{one of the many}} civilian vehicles that drive endlessly <b>around</b> <b>town,</b> or use a phone booth to select a car. The game's driving missions are also similar to those of Grand Theft Auto III. In both games, the player races against other characters, collects items before a timer runs out, and wrecks other cars.|$|E

5|$|In Oslo, {{the company}} had its offices and {{workings}} spread <b>around</b> <b>town.</b> The main depot was at the East Station; the head office was at Fred. Olsens gate 21 from 1919 to 1921, at Kongens gate 29 until 1932, and at Tollbodgaten 24 until 1938. Management wanted to centralise both a new depot and administrative offices at a single location close to the railway station, preferably co-located with a hotel. In 1936 work began on a hotel at Jernbanetorget, but the project was cancelled. The proposed hotel would have had 100 rooms {{across the street from}} Oslo Ø. However, the plans were blocked by Parliament (which was opposed to the state railway operating hotels). Instead, the administration moved into Nylandsveien 10, in a new building built on a lot owned by NSB.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{attempts}} to find her brother by exploring the Squidport for clues. She learns from Grampa that black sedans that have been appearing <b>around</b> <b>town</b> are connected to Bart's disappearance, she also learns from Chief Wiggum that government-style agents have been appearing across the Squidport area. Lisa destroys the sedans, but finds them to be empty. After completing a task for the Sea Captain, she destroys a black limo but discovers Bart {{got out of it}} and boarded a ship. She finds Bart on the ship; he appears to have memory loss and is mumbling unintelligibly, as well as soiling his pants, while occasionally mentioning the sedans and Buzz Cola.|$|E
5|$|That night, Lisa prays to God and assures him she has {{not turned}} her back on him, but plans to seek a new path to him. While on a walk <b>around</b> <b>town</b> passing many sacrilegious signs, she finds Springfield's Buddhist temple. Inside she sees Lenny and Carl meditating, and Hollywood actor Richard Gere teaches the core {{concepts}} of Buddhism to her. An intrigued Lisa takes a pamphlet on Buddhism and studies it at home. It convinces her of the virtues of the faith, and Lisa announces out her window she has become, and forever will be, a Buddhist. Lisa plants her own bodhi tree in the back yard and begins to meditate, but Marge grows increasingly worried about Lisa's soul and tries to convince her to come back to Christianity.|$|E
50|$|On 22 December, {{a ceasefire}} {{was signed in}} which both sides agreed to the removal of all their {{military}} checkpoints and barriers <b>around</b> the <b>town.</b> Neutral armed men from the Hashid and Bakil tribes would be deployed <b>around</b> the <b>town</b> to ensure both sides adhere to the ceasefire.|$|R
25|$|A French counterattack with {{reinforced}} troops {{was launched}} in late 1928 and on December 11, Karnou {{was killed by a}} French military patrol. The rebellion, however, continued to spread unevenly from the Sangha basin to include the neighbouring groups from Cameroon and the lower Ubangi region, namely in the Mbéré and Vina valleys of French Cameroons, <b>around</b> the <b>towns</b> of Baïbokoum and Moïssala in southern Chad, <b>around</b> the <b>towns</b> of Yaloke, Bambio, Ndele and Boda in the Mambéré-Kadéï and Lobaye regions of Ubangi-Shari, and <b>around</b> the <b>town</b> of Berandjoko in the French Congo.|$|R

Sixty-two pieces have been sponsored by local businesses and citizens, and design of the horses was conceived and painted by local artists. They are placed throughout the city and county.|$|E
5|$|When he {{was first}} {{developing}} the characters, Hillenburg wanted Pearl and Mr. Krabs to travel <b>around</b> <b>town</b> in a caravan boat with a whale-sized teardrop trailer connected to it; while this element did {{make it into the}} series, it was only used sparsely in early episodes. The decision to have Mr. Krabs and Pearl live in an anchor was made after production of the first season had begun. The original map of the show's setting, which Hillenburg showed Nickelodeon executives as part of his pitch to the network in 1997, did not include an anchor house, and instead labeled the Krusty Krab as both characters' residence.|$|E
5|$|Another {{close friend}} of SpongeBob is Sandy Cheeks, a {{squirrel}} from Texas. She is a scientist and an expert in karate. She lives in an oak tree entrapped in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal. When outside of her dwelling, she wears an astronaut-like suit because she cannot breathe underwater. Mr. Krabs, a miserly crab obsessed with money, {{is the owner of}} the Krusty Krab restaurant and SpongeBob's boss. Krabs has a teenage whale daughter named Pearl, whom he values equally with his riches. His rival, Plankton, is a small green copepod who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called the Chum Bucket, located {{across the street from the}} Krusty Krab. Plankton spends most of his time planning to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers, so as to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business. The majority of Plankton's plans come from his intelligent yet sarcastic computer wife Karen, who is more competent and less conceited than him. When SpongeBob is not working at the Krusty Krab, he can often be found at Mrs. Puff's boating school (the underwater equivalent of a driver's education course). SpongeBob is perpetually unable to pass Mrs. Puff's exams, which is why he almost always walks <b>around</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E

5|$|Teenager Billy Duncan {{wakes up}} in his bed, {{seemingly}} disturbed, and learns his mother is leaving for vacation. He goes to visit his girlfriend Kathy, but her deranged grandfather Colonel Farley makes him leave before he can see her. As Billy drives <b>around</b> <b>town,</b> he is harassed by bullies Chuck Boran and Froggy, and by two police deputies who give him a speeding ticket. Billy wanders into the desert and discovers the laser cannon and pendant. He starts playing with the cannon, pretending to shoot things, then realizes he can fire the weapon while wearing the pendant. Meanwhile, on the alien spacecraft, the two aliens converse with their leader who shows them footage of Billy using the cannon, prompting the aliens to turn their ship around {{to head back to}} Earth. Context implies that the two aliens, upon departing Earth, left the cannon and pendant behind under the presumption that no other human would be able to use them as the green-skinned man had, but they have now learned that they were in error.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Herod sees Cort's busted {{hand and}} gives Ratsy twenty seconds to leave town. He offers to face Cort left-handed, which Herod is equally fast at drawing with. Herod kills Ratsy {{with a rifle}} and then squares off to fight Cort. Herod then {{secretly}} tells his guards to kill Cort if he is the winner. At the moment Herod draws, several buildings explode on the street. Herod's house and the clock tower are also blown up, and through the smoke and flames, Ellen walks back into town, having faked her death {{with the help of}} Cort, Doc Wallace, the Blind Boy, and the Kid's stash of dynamite. Cort tells Herod that from now on all fights in town will be fair, and proceeds to kill Herod's men who were stationed <b>around</b> <b>town.</b> Ellen and Herod face off, and she finally reveals to him who she is when she throws her father's old badge at Herod's feet. They draw on each other; Herod shoots Ellen in the arm and she fires a shot though Herod's chest. Herod raises his gun to fire again but Ellen shoots him in the eye, finishing him for good. She throws her father's badge to Cort and names him as the new Marshal before saddling up and riding out of the town.|$|E
5|$|The trio {{were joined}} by General Trần Thiện Khiêm, the disaffected {{commander}} of the III Corps that surrounded Saigon, {{and an assortment of}} Marine, Air Force and Special Forces officers and their units. Other notable recruits were Diem loyalist and former chief of the Civil Guard, Duong Ngoc Lam, who was under investigation for corruption, and General Đức, who had recently returned from exile in Paris. The cabal scheduled the coup for 04:00, 30 January. On 29 January, Thi followed Khánh to the capital. The plotters and their agents met in obscure locations spots <b>around</b> <b>town.</b> On the night of 29 January, the rebel troops assumed their positions around Saigon. A number of American officers and embassy officials were alerted to be in their offices at 2:00. At 03:00, Khánh took over the Joint General Staff Headquarters at Tan Son Nhut, and by dawn, the coup had succeeded without a shot being fired as Minh's junta was caught unaware. The popular Minh was allowed to stay on as a ceremonial but powerless head of state, but his colleagues were taken into custody. Nevertheless, Minh remained disgruntled and persistently tried to regain his influence through political means. On 2 February 1964, Thi was appointed to be commander of the 1st Division based in Huế, as part of I Corps. He stayed in the post until 21 October and on 14 November, he took control of the entire corps. This corps oversaw the five northernmost provinces of central Vietnam and the 1st and 2nd Divisions.|$|E
