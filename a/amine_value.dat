40|$|The {{dispersion}} {{properties of}} carbon black (CB) slurries {{as well as}} the accompanying electrochemical properties of Li(Ni 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3) O 2 (NCM) electrodes were investigated by controlling the <b>amine</b> <b>value</b> of polyurethane-based dispersants. The increase in <b>amine</b> <b>value</b> of dispersants leads to an increase in adsorption level on CB surface due to a strong acid/base interaction between dispersants and CB particles, providing the improvement of steric repulsion between particles at the solid-liquid interface. This results in the enhancement of the dispersion stability of CB and the related microstructure of the electrodes. Electrochemical experiments indicated that the rate capabilities and cycle performance of the electrodes are in good agreement with dispersion properties of CB slurries. However, {{it was found that the}} excessive addition of the dispersant was deleterious to electrochemical properties because the non-adsorbed dispersants act as an electronic conduction barrier between solid phases. Therefore, it is suggested that the <b>amine</b> <b>value</b> of dispersant and tailored amount of dispersant addition can be key roles for obtaining the optimized dispersion stability of CB and the corresponding excellent electrochemical properties of the cathode. clos...|$|E

In this secondfermentation, malic acid is converted into L-lactic acid under controlled setups. Howeverthis process is not free from possible collateral effects that on some occasions produceoff-flavors, wine quality loss and human health problems. In warm viticulture regions suchas the south of Spain, the risk of suffering a deviation during the malolactic fermentationprocess increases due to the high must pH. This contributes to produce wines with highvolatile acidity and biogenic <b>amine</b> <b>values.</b> This manuscript develops a new red winemakingmethodology that consists of combining the use of two non-Saccharomyces yeast strains asan alternative to the traditional malolactic fermentation.

Replacement of ethylenediamine by ethanolamine replaced certain amide linkages by ester linkages, decreasing the intermolecular hydrogen bonding, leading to decrease in the crystallinity of the material, and thus the mechanical, thermal, adhesion, and rheological properties.

40|$|The role {{of copper}} in bovine serum amine oxidase was {{investigated}} {{by studying the}} effect of copper-binding inhibitors on the reactions of the pyrroloquinoline quinone carbonyl and on the reaction with oxygen. Hydrazines and hydrazides were used as carbonyl reagents {{and one of the}} hydrazines, benzylhydrazine, which was found to behave as a pseudo-substrate, was used to probe the reaction with oxygen. The presence of N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate, a chelator that binds copper irreversibly, did not prevent the reactions at the carbonyl, but slowed down their rate and modified the conformation of the adducts. The same happened to the reaction with oxygen, which was slowed down but not abolished. Copper, which was never seen in the reduced state, thus appears to control all reactions without being directly involved in the binding of either hydrazines or oxygen.

For those <b>amines</b> with pK(a) <b>values</b> ca. 8, both acid and base forms of the buffer react with 1. The magnitude of the kinetic term in the base form of the amine (RNH 2) increases with amine pK(a) and is attributed to nucleophilic addition of the amine to the epoxide group. Curvatures in plots of the kinetic term due to buffer (k(buff)) {{as a function of}} the mole fraction of buffer acid for substituted ammonium ions with pK(a) > 8 are interpreted in terms of a change in rate-limiting step of the general acid-catalyzed pathway from epoxide ring opening at low amine base concentrations to reaction of amine base acting as either a general base or nucleophile with an α-hydroxycarbocation at higher amine base concentrations. Thus, epoxide ring opening of I in buffer solutions of the more basic amines is a reversible reaction. Rate and product studies of the reaction of 1 in acid solutions (pH 5. 5) and in Tris buffer solutions containing sodium azide show that azide ion is effective in trapping the α- hydroxycarbocation intermediate, subsequent to its rate-limiting formation by reaction of 1 with either H+ or Tris-H+.

40|$|Activation of prohistidine decarboxylase (pi 6) from Lactobacillus 30 a {{proceeds}} by an intramolecular, pH- and monovalent cation-dependent {{reaction in}} which its constituent pi chains are cleaved nonhydrolytically between Ser- 81 and Ser- 82 with loss of NH 3 and conversion of Ser- 82 to the pyruvoyl residue of active histidine decarboxylase (alpha beta) 6. <b>Amines</b> with pKa <b>values</b> more than 7. 0 substitute for K+ or NH 4 + in the activation of prohistidine decarboxylase, {{but they also}} catalyze its inactivation in a competing reaction, pi 6 [...] pi' 6. Sequence analysis of the appropriate tryptic peptide from amine-inactivated prohistidine decarboxylase established that inactivation results from conversion of Ser- 82 of the pi chain to an aminoacrylate residue. The inactivated proenzyme (pi' 6) does not form histidine decarboxylase; this fact eliminates one of two postulated mechanisms of activation and, thus, favors activation by beta-elimination of the acyl group of an intermediate ester formed between Ser- 81 and Ser- 82. L-Histidine is bound by the proenzyme (Kd = 1. 7 x 10 (- 4) M) and is an effective activator; one binding site is present per pi subunit. K+, NH 4 +, and Na+ competitively inhibit (Ki values = 2. 8 - 4. 4 x 10 (- 3) M) activation by histidine. The data suggest the presence of two classes of monovalent cation binding sites on prohistidine decarboxylase: one (near Ser- 82) is readily saturable and one is unsaturable even by 2. 4 M K+...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree of}} deacetylation (DDA) of various low {{molecular}} weight chitosan (LMWC) species as the hydrochloride and free base (amine form) was determined by direct and back potentiometric titration, respectively. The DDA values obtained for the chitosan hydrochloride by direct titration were greater than 93 % for all oligomers tested (Molecular weight (Mwt) between about 1. 3 to 30. 0 kDa). However, the DDA values obtained for chitosan amine oligomers using back titration were significantly lower, especially for the relatively high molecular weight (30. 0 kDa) chitosan amine oligomers. Furthermore, after using the back titration method, greater DDA values were obtained for the same samples of chitosan amine after the chitosan solution had been heated to 60 EC before titration. In addition, the DDA values showed a significant decrease with increased concentration for a given chitosan oligomer. Although the effects of hydration time, ionic strength and method specific behavior were not explicitly studied and therefore cannot be entirely ruled out, {{the results from this}} study might be attributed to the conformation of changes of chitosan in solution that lead to more inter/intra attractive forces in the case of chitosan <b>amine.</b> The DDA <b>values</b> obtained by the potentiometric method were also compared with those obtained by the FDUV and IR spectroscopic methods. Thus, subject to the caveats mentioned above, DDA values obtained for chitosan amine by the back titration method should be used with caution since the results are significantly lower than those obtained by direct titration, FDUV spectroscopy or FTIR...|$|R
40|$|Differences in {{molecular}} properties between linear and branched alkanes as well {{as between}} compounds with branched alkyl groups is of relevance due to the large number of branched isomers of environmentally relevant compounds (e. g. fuels, fuel additives, surfactants). For branched alkane vapor pressures, the McGowan specific volume is a poor predictor. Therefore, in this study a correction on the McGowan specific volume is derived {{in terms of the number}} of branches and the number of pairs of vicinal branches to improve the prediction of branched alkane vapor pressures. This branching correction also brought branched /alkane solvent accessible volumes, octanol/water partition coefficients, air/hexadecane partition coefficients, and aqueous solubilities {{as well as}} alkyl-branched substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon air/hexadecane partition coefficients more in line with corresponding linear hydrocarbon properties when compared on a McGowan specific volume basis. Even for air-hexadecane partition coefficients of substituted aliphatic hydrocarbons with substituents at non-terminal carbons, application of the branching correction to the carbon bearing the substituent caused these partition coefficients to be more in line with those for linear compounds. Values for the Abraham A and B solvation parameters for nonlinear aliphatic ethers, amines, and alcohols, recalculated using branching corrected McGowan specific volumes, turned out to be closer to chemical expectations based on linear aliphatic ether, <b>amine</b> and alcohol <b>values</b> compared to previously reported experimental values obtained using uncorrected McGowan specific volumes. A comparison of alkylbenzene and alkene partition coefficient estimates from two different linear solvation energy relations, one containing a McGowan specific volume term and one without such a term, suggests that no branching correction is needed for alkyl groups at sp 2 carbons. The main advantage of using branching corrected McGowan specific volumes is that the values of other solvation parameters become chemically more consisten...|$|R
40|$|The {{procedures}} used in Spain for {{the extraction of}} salt include a case which uses the purification and crystallization of the salt obtained from the process {{for the production of}} potassium chloride by flotation. This process involves an initial stage consisting in the extraction of the raw mineral made up of sodium chloride and potassium chloride and other impurities. After the removal of some of the impurities, the mineral undergoes a flotation process for the separation of potassium chloride involving the use of different reactants, including flocculants, foaming agents and collectors. The salt obtained by means of this procedure between the sixties and the nineties was dumped as useless. Neverthless, those dumps are currently being used as raw material for obtaining table salt. The lack of information regarding the specific substances used in the potassium chloride production process, and its potential harmfulness, has created a safety concern. Therefore it has been considered necessary to assess a wide group of substances which may have been used in the process, with the recommendation of the absence of all these substances at levels above reference values, based on toxicological considerations. Therefore, {{from the point of view}} of the potential presence of aliphatic amines and amino alcohols the reference value to establish their absence is 0. 3 mg N 2 /kg of salt. For the specific case of the sum of potentially present aromatic <b>amines</b> a reference <b>value</b> for determining their absence is recommended as low as the detection limit of the analytical technique, at maximum of 30 µg of total aromatic amines/kg of salt. The absence of pine oil residues based on the determination of alpha terpineol must be established, at minimum, at a level of 1 µg/kg of salt...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of more sustainable catalytic reductive amination processes for the generation of high <b>value</b> <b>amines</b> represents a high priority challenge. An alternative cleaner route for the selective production of an amino acid (Tert-butylglycine, TBG) from a a-keto-carboxylic acid (Trimethylpyruvic acid TMP) under mild reaction conditions has been investigated. TMP was reacted with aqueous NH 3 and hydrogen gas under atmospheric pressure at 343 K over commercial Pd/C, Pt/C, Rh/C and Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. Catalyst characterization in terms of temperature programmed reduction (TPR), H 2 chemisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), BET area/pore volume and pH point of zero charge (pHpzc) measurements is provided and correlated with catalytic activity and selectivity. Mass transport contributions during reaction in a three phase slurry reactor were evaluated experimentally by varying (i) hydrogen flow rate, (ii) stirring speed, (iii) catalyst concentration and (iv) temperature. Reaction conditions wherein chemical control prevailed were established. Reductive amination rate was pressure invariant over the 1 - 20 bar range. Process optimisation revealed that the rate was sensitive to solution pH and NH 3 /TMP ratio. An increase in pH (with NaOH addition) above the pKa of ammonia was shown to elevate reaction rate. The basic character of the aminating agent also influenced rate as demonstrated by a comparison of activity using ammonium hydroxide, ammonium acetate and ammonium nitrate. Catalyst reuse was examined where a decline in activity was observed and is linked to pore occlusion and metal sintering. Solvent (water, 1 -propanol, 1 -butanol and aqueous mixtures of 1 -propanol/ 1 -butanol) effects were established where, in absence of mass transport limitations, reaction in pure 1 -butanol delivered higher rate, a response that is attributed to combined TMP solubility and ammonia solvation. With the goal of probing reaction mechanism, the amination of two additional a-keto-carboxylic acids (pyruvic acid and phenylpyruvic acid) were screened where steric hindrance due to the substituent resulted in lower reaction rate...|$|R
40|$|Three New Zealand marine species, hoki (Macruronus novaezealandiae), kahawai (Arripis trutta) and {{trevally}} (Pseudocaranx dentex) {{were used}} to develop model fermented fish sausage. The formulation comprised fish mince, carbohydrate, minced garlic {{and salt in a}} mass ratio of 1 (fish) : 0. 15 : 0. 05 : 0. 03, respectively. The carbohydrate source was cooked rice or glucose. (Endogenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) failed to ferment rice). Folate was also added to the mixture as a factor. The mixtures were extruded into 50 mL plastic syringes, where the needle end of the barrel had been excised by lathe. The lubricated barrel was overfilled to 60 mL, capped with a layer of ParafilmTM and aluminium foil, sealed tightly by rubber band and incubated at 30 °C. Over time the piston was progressively advanced to yield samples for microbiological, physical, and chemical analysis. Over 96 hours an increase in the LAB count was observed with a concomitant decrease in pH. After fermentation was complete, the samples contained around 8. 77 log cfu LAB g- 1 with the pH range from 4. 38 to 5. 08. The microbiological and pH behaviour of each species varied between preparations. Hardness, adhesiveness, springiness and cohesiveness of the treatments increased with fermentation, except for hoki. The treatments showed different colour characteristics with fermentation. The light reflectance (L* values) of the trevally and kahawai treatments increased, while the a* (redness) and b* (yellowness) values decreased. Hoki exhibited smaller colour changes except for yellowness, which increased markedly. Proteolysis, measured colorimetrically by soluble peptide bonds, was greatest for trevally. Lipid oxidation, measured by the thiobarbituric acid method, was least for hoki, notably the species with the lowest fat content. Biogenic amines, which are a general quality indicator of fermented products, increased during fermentation. The trevally treatment generated the highest concentration of <b>amines,</b> but these <b>values</b> were lower than those reported for fermented fish sausage in Southeast Asia. Notably there were no important difference between folate treatments and those without folate. The results point to commercial opportunities and further research with New Zealand marine species, especially trevally. To improve the product quality and to show geographical exclusivity, further research could be done by using starter culture, and a New Zealand staple carbohydrate source such as kumara and potato, and spices and herbs which are commonly used in New Zealand, such as rosemary, thyme and sage or specific to New Zealand, such as horopito. In addition, sensory studies should also be performed before the products could be tested in the market...|$|R
