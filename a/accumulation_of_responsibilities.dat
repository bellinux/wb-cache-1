Many people begin their careers without expecting {{to be involved in}} entrepreneurship, they accumulate over time, skills and knowledge that challenge them, eventually to exceed the limits previously imposed by themselves, while in other cases, the quality of entrepreneurs is that they start their careers. Whatever path they followed, responsibilities will be the same, although there is a higher probability of success for the gradual <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> High percentage of those who still have not validated the economic environment indicate the need to restructure the educational environment, the continuous adaptation of education offered to the market and the involvement of persons seeking employment or who are dissatisfied with what currently working in professional qualification courses...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the nursing work organization in long-stay institutions for the elderly and its relationship to pleasure and suffering at work. Data were collected through observation and interviews between April and September 2013 and submitted to content analysis, in light of Dejours' psychodynamics of work theory. Professionals experience suffering as they face physical exertion, a fast-paced work environment and repetitive routines, limited human resources, <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and lack of medical service in the institution. Pleasure is experienced through the division of labor among workers, staff's good working relationships, freedom to change the work organization and the possibility of creating a bond with the elderly. The study provides subsidies for planning adequacies in the nursing work organization at these institutions, which will improve the workers' relationship to their work activities...|$|E
40|$|As {{the numbers}} of older persons (and with managed chronic diseases) {{increases}} rapidly, so will {{the number of people}} involved in caring, as the case of Mary illustrates. This is both a threat and a challenge to understanding and upholding the generally accepted ethical principle of respect for autonomy of patients. I will argue that we need to broaden the traditional ethical framework in addressing the connectivity between patients and their carers. We first need a new understanding {{of what it means to}} be elderly and dependent. Vulnerability is often understood as an inescapable dimension of life, but its meaning in healthcare is unclear. In gerontology, the concept of frailty is used. The degree of frailty reflects overall functional capacity, which is dependent on many factors, including social and psychological functioning and thus ‘self-management capabilities'. We will discuss the meaning of autonomy in the context of frailty, vulnerability and care dependency in elderly persons. In what way is Mary frail, vulnerable, dependent? Secondly, we need to understand the position of informal carers (Mary's stepson, niece, neigbours) who are partners in the (virtual) support team. These carers can be described as ‘dependency workers' (Kittay 1999) - they support someone who is dependent upon them, but this dependency in turn makes them vulnerable, and thus in need of ‘care for the carer'. Formal agencies, and related records, need to develop ways of identifying the needs of these ‘dependency workers' for respect and support. We need to remedy for the fact that informal carers are not only a resource and a team member but also persons with consequent needs and rights in their own respect. We will need to assess the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> many informal carers face (Mary's neighbours keeping an eye on her and at the same time caring for their own partner).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Owing to adverse pharmacokinetics, {{azathioprine}} {{treatment may}} fail to induce a satisfactory clinical response in systemic connective tissue diseases. The major intracellular cytotoxic metabolites of azathioprine are 6 -thioguanine nucleotides (6 TGNs). METHODS: To assess whether the erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN is a clinically applicable index for monitoring azathioprine treatment, erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN was measured in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 12), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 7), polyarteritis nodosa (n = 2), myositis (n = 1), or leukocytoclastic vasculitis (n = 1). Ages ranged from 28 to 75 (median 58) years. RESULTS: Erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN varied among the patients from 20 to 303 (median value 95) nmol/mmol haemoglobin. No significant correlation was found between erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN and the dose of azathioprine/kg body weight, {{the age of the}} patients, the duration of treatment, or the presence of myelotoxicity or hepatotoxicity. The interindividual coefficient of variation (CV) in the erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN/mg azathioprine/kg body weight was 0. 65. The median intraindividual CV in erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN at an unchanged dose of azathioprine was 0. 09 (19 patients; range 0. 03 - 0. 27). CONCLUSIONS: The low intraindividual variation compared with the high interpatient variation in erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN implies that erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN may be clinically applicable for monitoring azathioprine treatment. Prospective studies are needed to clarify the relation between the erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN and the clinical response to treatment, and to establish recommendations for dose modifications...|$|R

The <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> ALA, eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5 n- 3), docosapentaenoic acid (22 : 5 n- 3), and 24 : 5 n- 3 in cell phospholipids was linearly related to the concentration of supplemented ALA over the range tested (1. 8 - 72 microM). The <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> the post-D 6 D products of 22 : 5 n- 3, 24 : 6 n- 3 and DHA, in cell phospholipids was saturated at concentrations of > 18 microM ALA.
