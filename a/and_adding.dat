40|$|This study {{reviewed}} {{the literature on}} ADHD/ADD including {{a survey of the}} disorder, current clinical interventions and, diagnostic techniques. Data was collected comparing three groups of children (control, ADHD, ADD) on a newly developed nonverbal assessment test, the Leiter-R. The findings show that the Leiter-R resulted in significant differences in scores between the control group and the ADHD <b>and</b> <b>ADD</b> groups on twelve of the twenty subtests. This demonstrates the efficacy of the Leiter-R as an assessment tool for ADHD <b>and</b> <b>ADD.</b> Based on these findings the following tentative recommendations were proposed to assist children with ADHD <b>and</b> <b>ADD.</b> Children with ADHD <b>and</b> <b>ADD</b> need to have assistance with cognitive deficits as well as with behavioral problems. Children with ADHD <b>and</b> <b>ADD</b> may learn better when material is presented visually rather than in oral form only. Affected children may need to be taught problem solving skills because they have trouble generalizing from one situation to another. Research with children with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) has {{led to the development of}} teaching strategies that may be helpful with children with ADHD <b>and</b> <b>ADD...</b>|$|R
