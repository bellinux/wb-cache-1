5000|$|Even {{though a}} fair number of {{international}} observers were present, the CNE instituted an open and public series of audits of the vote results. Each one of the 11,118 <b>automated</b> <b>polling</b> places was equipped with multiple high-tech touch-screen DRE voting machines, one to a [...] "mesa electoral", or voting [...] "table". In total, 32,331 voting machines were in use country-wide. After the vote is cast, each machine prints out a paper ballot, or VVPAT, which is inspected by the voter and deposited in a ballot box belonging to the machine's table. The voting machines perform in a stand-alone fashion, disconnected from any network until the polls close. Voting session closure at each of the voting stations in a given polling center is determined either by the lack of further voters after the lines have emptied, or by the hour, at the discretion {{of the president of the}} voting table.|$|E

This is the final report which documents the development of Internet-based data logger polling. The project consists of two main tasks: the development of <b>automated</b> <b>polling</b> procedures that can be launched remotely with no operator input, {{and the development of}} a polling engine to launch the above procedures and pass the data on to the database server. This final report describes the <b>automated</b> <b>polling</b> procedures that have been developed for Synergistic, Highland and ABB loggers. This report also describes the universal polling engine, which, in addition to launching polling and transferring data, is able to convert ABB data into Synergistic format (the format required to load the data into the LoanSTAR Informix database). The results of testing with Synergistic, Highland and ABB loggers are also described, as well as the real-world production use with ABB power meter loggers at West Texas A&M University...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{technology}} enhancements {{have been}} used worldwide {{to fulfill the requirements}} of the industrial sector, especially in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems as a part of industrial control systems (ICS). SCADA systems have gained popularity in industrial automations due to technology enhancements and connectivity with modern computer networks and/or protocols. The procurement of new technologies has made SCADA systems important and helpful to processing in oil lines, water treatment plants, and electricity generation and control stations. On the other hand, these systems have vulnerabilities like other traditional computer networks (or systems), especially when interconnected with open platforms. Many international organizations and researchers have proposed and deployed solutions for SCADA security enhancement, but most of these have been based on node-to-node security, without emphasizing critical sessions that are linked directly with industrial processing and automation. This study concerns SCADA security measures related to critical processing with specified sessions of <b>automated</b> <b>polling,</b> analyzing cryptography mechanisms and deploying the appropriate explicit inclusive security solution in a distributed network protocol version 3 (DNP 3) stack, as part of a SCADA system. The bytes flow through the DNP 3 stack with security computational bytes within specified critical intervals defined for polling. We took critical processing knowledge into account when designing a SCADA/DNP 3 testbed and deploying a cryptography solution that did not affect communications...|$|E

The findings come from a weighted JWS Research national IVR (<b>automated)</b> <b>poll</b> of over 1, 500 Australians, commissioned by The Climate Institute and presented in this two-page factsheet. The issue of most importance driving Australians’ votes yesterday was concern for the economy and jobs (31 per cent).

50|$|Two days out, a ReachTEL <b>automated</b> phone <b>poll</b> of 678 respondents, {{commissioned}} by the Save Our Councils Coalition, showed the Liberals with a 54.7 percent primary vote after exclusion of the 15.3 percent undecided. Accurately interpreted, this amounted to a 6.4 percent drop from the 2013 Liberal vote, rather than the 14.7 percent in the report, which ignored the undecided component. The poll result had the Greens on 22.8 percent, the Christian Democratic Party on 4.1 percent, and everyone else on 18.3 percent.|$|R
25|$|More {{than a dozen}} {{candidates}} ran in the Portland race, but {{news outlets}} called Dozono the only candidate to provide a serious challenge to front-runner Sam Adams. An <b>automated</b> telephone <b>poll</b> of approximately 600 Portland residents in early April suggested that Dozono was within a percentage point of Adams in supporters. In the official results of the vote, Dozono garnered the second most votes of any candidate, around 34%, while Adams won with over 50%. Winning over 50% ensures that no run off vote is required in November to confirm the result. According to Dozono's campaign manager, it is not expected that he will run for office again.|$|R

After the charges were dropped, Cahaly filed a suit against state officials (including SLED Chief Reginald Lloyd), claiming his constitutional right to free speech had been violated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Donor risk-behavior {{assessment}} {{is important for}} blood safety. Few evaluations of automated telephone systems for eliciting risk exposure among voluntary blood donors have been reported. STUDY DESIGN and METHODS: A modified risk-behavior questionnaire was presented after donation via an <b>automated</b> telephone <b>polling</b> system to 805 of 15, 092 Hong Kong Chinese voluntary blood donors. Risk-behavior rates were compared to those of all other donors (14, 287) simultaneously completing the questionnaire in a pencil-and-paper format. RESULTS: The telephone group included proportionally more women (46. 3 % vs. 44. 9 %), previous donors (93. 3 % vs. 83. 6 %), and sexually inactive donors (66. 5 % vs. 71. 2 %) with lower educational achievement (60. 7 % vs. 54. 5 %). The telephone group demonstrated fewer missing data (mean 1. 3 %, range 0. 4 %- 3. 1 % vs. mean 9. 8 %, range 8. 0 %- 14. 2 %) and more complete demographic detailing, probably accounting for the demographic differences. The telephone group reported higher prevalence rates of needle or syringe sharing (1. 5 % vs. 0. 3 %), homosexual and/or bisexual intercourse (4. 1 % vs. 1. 3 %), knowing or suspecting that partner had intercourse with another during past year (12. 4 % vs. 8. 5 %), and future intention to use blood donation {{as a means to}} test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; 19. 1 % vs. 13. 7 %). There was no difference in knowledge of the HIV window period or proportions visiting or using condoms with commercial sex workers between telephone and pencil-and-paper groups. CONCLUSION: This survey with automated telephone screening of potential blood donors revealed increased reporting of risk exposure relative to commonly used paper-and-pencil methods. This raises questions of possible underreporting of risk among blood donors screened by paper questionnaire and perhaps face-to-face interview. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
