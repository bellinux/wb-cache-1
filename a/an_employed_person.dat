40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a social identity perspective to job insecurity research.

Job insecurity hence threatens a person’s social identity as <b>an</b> <b>employed</b> <b>person.</b> This in turn will affect well-being and job performance. A three-wave survey study among 377 British employees supports this perspective. Persons who felt higher levels of job insecurity {{were more likely to}} report a weaker social identity as <b>an</b> <b>employed</b> <b>person.</b> This effect was found to be stable over time, and also held against a test of reverse causality. Furthermore, social identity as <b>an</b> <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> influenced well-being and in-role job performance and mediated the effect of job insecurity on these two variables over time.

30|$|Secondly, total {{work hours}} is also {{closely related to}} work-family conflict, which is a key factor {{affecting}} the subjective well-being of individuals, especially women. Work-family conflict refers to the conflict in roles that occurs when <b>an</b> <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> cannot simultaneously fulfill their duties at work and at home (Greenhaus and Beutell 1985). In modern societies, work-family conflict has been becoming a very common social phenomenon, one leading to serious consequences for individuals, families, and work organizations (Jacobs and Gerson 2004; Nomaguchi 2009). Some researchers consider time conflict (the distribution of time spent for work and family) as a basic form of work-family conflict. When more time is spent in the labor market, it may inevitably squeeze the time that can be spent at home (Greenhaus and Beutell 1985).|$|E

40|$|In {{times of}} {{persistently}} high unemployment, labour market policy measures become increasingly important. Apart from traditional programmes such as continuous vocational training or re-education, the transition into self-employment is promoted in many industrialised countries. The {{aim is to}} shift {{people out of the}} unemployment status and to reduce the level of unemployment. In Germany, the transition from unemployment to self-employment is supported by the Federal Employment Services by so-called bridging allowances. Since August 1994, the conditions for receiving allowances were considerably eased, which led to a sharp {{increase in the number of}} people subsidised. In 1996, the transition of 90, 000 unemployed people into selfemployment was supported, compared to 25, 000 in 1993. A discussion of expected costs and benefits of self-employment gives reason to assume that the threshold of expected income at which a decision in favour of selfemployment is made is lower for unemployed people. Opportunity costs of business formation by unemployed persons probably lie below those of <b>an</b> <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> with the same endowment of human and financial capital, while the sunk costs migh...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} causes of {{unemployment}} persistence among the Belgian labour force. The underlying issue {{was to determine the}} impact of past unemployment spells on future labour market opportunities. Some European studies have demonstrated the existence of a true causal relationship between successive unemployment spells implying a stigmatisation effect for the unemployed. This so-called state dependence can occur through a reduction in human capital or through employer recruitment and labour retention practices. The model used is a dynamic random effects probit model controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and the initial condition problem. It was applied on the Panel Study on Belgian Households, covering the years 1994 to 2002. The results suggest that while observed and unobserved heterogeneity explain between 57 % and 82 % of unemployment persistence, the remainder is induced by the presence of state dependence. All else equal, an individual unemployed this year will be between 11. 4 and 33 percentage points more likely to be unemployed next year as compared with <b>an</b> <b>employed</b> <b>person.</b> The presence of a stigmatisation effect of unemployment involves that the costs of unemployment are muc...|$|E

50|$|Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity Barbara Castle {{introduced}} <b>an</b> <b>Employed</b> <b>Persons</b> (Health and Safety) Bill in 1970 but {{the debate}} around the Bill soon generated {{a belief that}} it did not address fundamental issues of workplace safety. In the same year, the Occupational Safety and Health Act was passed into United States federal law. As a result, a committee of inquiry chaired by Lord Robens was established towards the end of Harold Wilson's first government. When the Conservative Party came to power following the United Kingdom general election, 1970, they gave Castle's Bill no parliamentary time, preferring to wait for the Robens Report which was published in 1972. Conservative Secretary of State for Employment William Whitelaw introduced a new Bill on 28 January 1974 but Labour were returned to power in the United Kingdom general election, February 1974 and the Bill again lost. The new Labour administration finally secured the passage of a Bill that year.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{dynamics}} of labor markets in Chile. Our goal is to understand how flexibility {{in the labor market}} has changed over time, and in particular, to relate this change with the legislation framework. We analyze mobility in four different periods, each of them associated with different labor regimes. Based on flows, we estimate transition probabilities across three relevant possible states: unemployment, employment, and out of the labor force. Our finding shows that since 1974 employment became less secure. The probability for <b>an</b> <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> of becoming unemployed almost doubled since 1974 and remained thereafter. Also, the probability of remaining unemployed increased from 26, 1 % in the period 1962 - 73, to over 40 % in the periods 1974 - 79 and 1980 - 89, but felt to 25, 6 % after 1990. This in spite the average unemployment rate doubled between these two periods. The probabilities related with discourage and added worker effects were stable in the different periods considered, except since 1990, where the hypothesis of discouraged workers is challenged. Finally, whilst the natural rate of unemployment doubled after the reforms in 1974, it remained high until the last period, starting in 1990. Changes in participation compensated such changes, and hence, the expected length of unemployment did not increase dramatically in the period, remaining stable around two quarterslabor markets, transition probabilities, unemployment. ...|$|E
40|$|The sharp {{increase}} in unemployment in the 1990 s has focused attention once again on the causes, extent and effects of high and long-term unemployment. This article presents a methodology for estimating the cost, in income terms, that individuals and their families bear {{as a result of}} becoming unemployed. Estimates of the cost of job loss are developed for Australia for the period 1973 to 1992. Two methods of estimating the cost of job loss are presented in this article. The first method is the conditional cost of job loss which refers to the loss in income <b>an</b> <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> would incur over a given period of time if they became unemployed. In Australia, the conditional cost of job loss rose sharply in the mid 1980 s and again in the early 1990 s because of a marked increase in the average duration of unemployment which more than offset a slight increase in the net replacement ratio (that is, the ratio of unemployment income to wage income). The second cost of job loss measure we estimate is the expected cost of job loss. This measure refers to the difference between the expected income stream of workers and the income stream associated with continued certain employment. We interpret the expected cost of job loss as an indicator of the bargaining strength of workers.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the causes of unemployment persistence among the Belgian labour force. The underlying issue is to determine the eventual existence of a true causal relationship between successive unemployment spells. Design/methodology/approach - The model used is a dynamic random effects probit model controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and the initial condition problem. It was applied to the Panel Study on Belgian Households (1994 - 2002). Findings - The results suggest that while observed and unobserved heterogeneity explain between 57 per cent and 82 per cent of unemployment persistence, the remainder is induced by the presence of state dependence. All else being equal, an individual unemployed this year will be between 11. 4 and 33 percentage points more likely to be unemployed next year as compared with <b>an</b> <b>employed</b> <b>person.</b> Practical implications - The presence of a stigmatisation effect of unemployment means that the costs of unemployment are much higher than the simple loss of income and human capital associated with the current job loss. The study demonstrates the importance of concentrating efforts on the prevention of unemployment. Originality/value - The paper's contribution is to test again the hypothesis of the presence of state dependence in unemployment using a different technique, allowing, among other things, to control for exogenous variables. The paper demonstrates its existence and measures its contribution in the explanation of unemployment persistence in Belgium, besides that of observed and unobserved characteristics. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.
