40|$|The {{development}} of the multiphase morphology of uncompatibilized blends of poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) and <b>acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene</b> <b>terpolymer</b> (ABS) and PBT/ABS blends compatibilized with methyl-methacrylate glycidyl-methacrylate (MMA-GMA) reactive copolymers during compounding in a twin-screw extruder and subsequent injection molding was investigated. Uncompatibilized PBT/ABS 60 / 40 (wt %) and compatibilized PBT/ABS/MMA-GMA with 2 and 5 wt % of MMA-GMA showed refined cocontinuous morphologies at {{the front end of}} the extruder, which coarsened towards the extruder outlet. Coarsening in uncompatibilized PBT/ ABS blends is much more pronounced than in the compatibilized PBT/ABS/MMA-GMA equivalents and decreases with increasing amounts of the MMA-GMA. For both systems, significant refinement on the phase morphology was found to occur after the blends pass through the extruder die. This phenomenon was correlated to the capacity of the die in promoting particles break-up due to the extra elongational stresses developed at the matrix entrance. Injection molding induces coarsening of the ABS domains in the case of uncompatibilized PBT/ABS blends, while the reactive blend kept its refined phase morphology. Therefore, the compatibilization process of PBT/ABS/ MMA-GMA blends take place progressively leading to a further refinement of the phase morphology in the latter steps, owing to the slow reaction rate relative to epoxide functions and the carboxyl/hydroxyl groups...|$|E
40|$|Polymer-layered clay {{nanocomposite}} {{has received}} much attention {{because of the}} significant improvement in thermal stability, flame retardancy and mechanical properties of virgin polymer at very low clay loading. The preparation of a nanocomposite may be accomplished either by in-situ polymerization or by blending, with melt blending the industrially preferred process. In order to obtain a well-dispersed nanocomposite by melt blending, two major factors, compatibility and thermal stability, must be considered. The correct design of modified clay is the key factor to ensure the effective penetration of the polymer or oligomer into the clay layers and results in the desired exfoliated or intercalated nanocomposite. In this study, we have prepared polymer-layered clay nanocomposite using different oligomerically modified clays, which include polycaprolactone, polystyrene copolymer or terpolymer and poly (methyl methacrylate) copolymer. These nanocomposites were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, cone calorimetry and mechanical properties. The results show that polycaprolactone-modified clay can give a completely exfoliated nanocomposite when a clay which contains hydroxyl functionality is used while either immisible or intercalated nanocomposite are formed when the starting clay does not contain functional groups on the ammonium cation; the incorporation of phosphate {{as a component of}} an oligomeric ammonium salt modified clay nanocomposite gives a large reduction in the peak heat release rate, suggesting this system has potential for the formation of fire retardant polymeric system. Maleic anhydride modified clay improves the compatibility between the clay and polystyrene, while high and low molecular weight oligomerically-modified clay only has an effect on the mechanical properties and there is no effect on the other properties. A methyl methacrylate oligomerically modified clay show mixed intercalated/exfoliated morphology depending on polymer nature, it has good compatibility with poly (methyl methacrylate) and high impact polystyrene, HIPS, but not with <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> <b>terpolymer,</b> polypropylene, or polyethylene...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this study}} <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> (ABS) <b>terpolymer</b> was {{reinforced}} with HNO 3 -treated short carbon fibers (HCFs). The effects of HCF concentration on the tensile {{properties of the}} composites were examined. Increasing the HCF concentration in the ABS matrix from 10 to 30 wt % resulted in improved tensile strength and tensile modulus. To obtain a strong interaction at the interface, polyamide- 6 (PA 6) at varying concentrations was introduced into the ABS/ 10 wt % SCF composite. The incorporation and increasing amount of PA 6 in the composites increased tensile properties of the ABS/PA 6 /HCF systems due to the improved adhesion at the interface, which was confirmed by the ratio of tensile strength as an adhesion parameter. These results were also supported by scanning electron micrographs of the ABS/PA 6 /HCF composites, which exhibited an improved adhesion between the SCFs and the ABS/PA 6 matrix.

40|$|Low {{and high}} {{molecular}} weights poly(ethylene glycols) (PEGs), the PEG- 400 and PEG- 20000, respectively and also, poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) {{with a very}} high molecular weight of 170000, were considered as the modifiers for <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> (ABS) <b>terpolymer</b> in CO 2 /N 2 separation. The gas permeation and separation properties of the prepared membranes were studied. The results showed that CO 2 permeability as well as CO 2 /N 2 selectivity increased for all the blends compared with the pristine ABS. Furthermore, {{it was revealed that}} the selectivity enhancements were mostly due to the solubility rather than the diffusivity. Finally, it was concluded that the ABS/PEG blend membranes offered better results than ABS/PVAc ones for capturing CO 2 from flue gases. Among the studied PEGs, the PEG- 20000 showed better results than PEG- 400. By this modification, CO 2 permeability and CO 2 /N 2 selectivity increased from 5. 22 and 25. 97 for the pristine ABS to 9. 76 and 44. 36 for the PEG- 20000 modified ABS, respectively which caused an increase of nearly 87 % in permeability and 71 % in selectivity...|$|R
40|$|Poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) / <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> (ABS) <b>terpolymer</b> blends were {{prepared}} in a twin screw extruder {{and the use}} of methyl methacrylate-glycidyl methacrylate-ethyl acrylate (MGE) terpolymer as compatibilization additive was evaluated. The effect of different screw profiles and mixing conditions were evaluated on the crystallization of the blends. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to evaluate melting and crystallization behaviors of the PBT/ABS blends. The binary PBT/ABS blend has shown a double melting peak when cooled at lower cooling rates, mainly due to its melt-recrystallization during the heating up step. ABS has not affected the melting characteristics of neat PBT. The presence of MGE, as a reactive compatibilizer, in the PBT/ABS blends has reduced its heat of fusion and has partially inhibited its melt-recrystallization under heating. As result, it has prevented the occurrence of double melting peak. The epoxy functional groups of the MGE may react in situ to the carbonyls and hydroxyls end groups of the PBT molecules, thereby hindering the mobility of PBT molecules during the crystallization process due to its grafting to the compatibilizer molecules. The melt mixed blends prepared at lower feeding rate have shown a higher degree of crystallinity for the PBT/ABS blend, probably due to degradation of PBT caused by longer residence time in the extruder. The highest shear stress imposed to the blends at higher screw speed increased the degree of crystallinity of PBT, also due to its degradation...|$|R
