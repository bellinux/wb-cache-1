40|$|Patterned {{surfaces}} {{were created}} using two polymers: polystyrene (PS) {{on the one}} hand, and either poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) or poly(methyl methacrylate) -poly(methacrylic acid) (PMMA-PMAA) on the other hand. PMMA was dissolved in a solvent of PS; this solution was then spin-coated on a PS support that partially dissolved during the process. The materials were analyzed by water contact angle measurement, XPS, ToF-SIMS and AFM. The effect of the solvent on the final surface morphology was strongly marked. With chloroform, the <b>acrylic</b> <b>polymer</b> was the major surface constituent, possibly {{because of the high}} evaporation rate of this solvent. With toluene, which is a better solvent for PS compared to PMMA, the obtained surface was almost exclusively constituted of PS. The use of chlorobenzene provided inclusions of <b>acrylic</b> <b>polymer</b> in PS, both polymers being exposed at the outermost surface.

50|$|Growing {{concerns}} about {{the health effects of}} acids and solvents {{led to the development of}} less toxic etching methods in the late 20th century. An early innovation was the use of floor wax as a hard ground for coating the plate. Others, such as printmakers Mark Zaffron and Keith Howard, developed systems using <b>acrylic</b> <b>polymers</b> as a ground and ferric chloride for etching. The polymers are removed with sodium carbonate (washing soda) solution, rather than solvents. When used for etching, ferric chloride does not produce a corrosive gas, as acids do, thus eliminating another danger of traditional etching.|$|E

Natural sealants and adhesive-sealants included plant resins such as pine pitch and birch pitch, bitumen, wax, tar, natural gum, clay (mud) mortar, lime mortar, lead, blood and egg. In the 17th century glazing putty was first used to seal window glass made with linseed oil and chalk, later other drying oils were also used to make oil-based putties which were often referred to as caulks. In the 1920s polymers such as <b>acrylic</b> <b>polymers,</b> butyl polymers and silicone polymers were first developed and used in sealants.

50|$|The {{introduction}} of polymer-modified bitumen and emulsion binder has increased chipseal's ability to prevent crack reflection and improve stone retention by improving {{the properties of}} the bitumen binder. Newer techniques use asphalt emulsion (a mixture of liquid asphalt, surfactant, and water) instead of asphalt. This has been shown to help reduce aggregate loss and reduce cost of installation, but can increase stripping. It reduces emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) due to the lower solvent content. New methods also utilize cross linking styrene <b>acrylic</b> <b>polymers</b> which also provide quality water resistance. Chips precoated with about one percent bitumen have been used successfully to minimize aggregate loss and to give the surface a black look. It can keep good pavement in good condition by sealing out water, but provides no structural strength and will repair only minor cracks. While the small stones used as surface yield a relatively even surface without the edges of patches, it also results in a very rough surface that leads to louder rolling noise from automobile wheels.|$|E

40|$|Polymer {{modified}} cement-based {{materials and}} fiber reinforced cementitious composites are both {{widely used in}} civil engineering applications. Both show great advantages, especially in repair and rehabilitation. The work reported here, however, deals with polymer modified fiber reinforced cement based composites (PM-FRC) that is, combined used of fibers and polymers in the same system. This paper reports the quantitative study of all the three additives each taken with three settings, namely, steel fiber (1. 0 %, 1. 5 % and 2. 0 %), <b>acrylic</b> emulsion <b>polymer</b> (1. 0 %, 2. 5 % and 4. 0 %) and silica fume (5. 0 %, 6. 0 % and 8. 0 %). The other two control variables were chosen as water-cement ratio (0. 42, 0. 50 and 0. 60) and aging (3, 7 and 28 days). In this study, steel fiber reinforced polymer modified concrete (SFRPMC) was produced {{with the addition of}} <b>acrylic</b> emulsion <b>polymer</b> (< 4 %) into steel fiber reinforced concrete which enhance the workability, strength and thermal properties. The unique properties of steel fiber qualify it to be the best option as reinforcement in <b>acrylic</b> <b>polymer</b> cement composite. However, uniform dispersion is the biggest challenge in generating a composite with an optimum performance. Hence, <b>acrylic</b> emulsion <b>polymer</b> and silica fume with different percentages was used {{to improve the quality of}} steel fiber reinforced concrete. In this study, we have used a comprehensive approach known as Design of Experimental (DoE) which had been applied efficiently from the material formulation and processing stage until the material characterization. Through verification experiment, the compressive strength had increased by as much as 59 % compared to control concrete specimen. To optimize other mechanical properties such as flexural strength, splitting tensile strength and modulus of elasticity, the L 9 array method was used. Variant analysis and average analysis were then used to get the optimum formulation and through the X-ray diffraction analysis, the dispersion of <b>acrylic</b> <b>polymer</b> is slightly improved when combined with steel fiber reinforced concrete. From morphology observation, the dispersion of steel fiber with <b>acrylic</b> <b>polymer</b> addition showed a better uniformed dispersion in SFRPMC. Through thermal analysis, optimum specimen was proven to own good thermal stability than the other specimens. Steel fiber reinforced <b>acrylic</b> emulsion <b>polymer</b> modified concrete (SFRPMC) were produced based on the significant parameters suggested by Taguchi Analysis that was performed earlier. SFRPMC had improved the dispersion of steel fiber and <b>acrylic</b> <b>polymer</b> in matrix composite due to the presence of a few functional groups of elements from different materials, as observed through the morphology examination through SEMEDX analysis. Synergistic effect between the fibers and the polymer were observed in most of the composites as long as suitable polymer dosages were used. It is concluded that a high performance composites with 2. 5 % <b>acrylic</b> emulsion <b>polymer,</b> 8 % silica fume, 1. 5 % steel fiber and water-cement ratio 0. 50 at 28 days curing could be a promising material for both structural and repair purpose...|$|R
