500|$|Jolie was {{involved}} in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She {{had fallen in love with}} Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair, saying, [...] "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife." [...] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.|$|E
500|$|The Sandman {{became a}} cult success for DC Comics and {{attracted}} an audience {{unlike that of}} mainstream comics: much of the readership was female, many were in their twenties, and many read no other comics at all. Comics historian Les Daniels called Gaiman's work [...] "astonishing" [...] and noted that The Sandman was [...] "a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before." [...] DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that [...] "The Sandman became the first extraordinary success {{as a series of}} graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure." [...] Gaiman had a finite run in mind for the series, and it concluded with issue No. 75. Gaiman said in 1996, [...] "Could I do another five issues of Sandman? Well, damn right. And would I be able to look <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the mirror happily? No. Is it time to stop because I've reached the end, yes, and I think I'd rather leave while I'm in love." [...] The final issue, No. 75, was dated March 1996.|$|E
500|$|... "Much {{has been}} written about that scene ... most of it silly," [...] wrote Gene Lees in High Fidelity. The scene was {{inspired}} by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering. [...] During [...] "Where Do I Go?", the stage was covered in a giant scrim, beneath which those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes. [...] At the musical cue, [...] "they [...] naked and motionless, their bodies bathed in Fisher's light projection of floral patterns. [...] They chant of 'beads, flowers, freedom, and happiness.'" [...] It lasted only twenty seconds. Indeed, the scene happened so quickly and was so dimly lit that it prompted Jack Benny, during the interval at a London preview, to quip, [...] "Did you happen to notice if any of them were Jewish?" [...] Nevertheless, the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places. It also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes. Groucho Marx quipped, [...] "I was gonna go see it, and then I called up the theater. ... They said the tickets were $11 apiece. I told them I'd call back, went into my bathroom, took off all my clothes, and looked <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the full-length mirror. Then I called the theater and said, 'Forget it.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My DEAR MR. WILLIS--I {{am about}} {{to make an effort}} <b>at</b> re-establishing <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the {{literary}} world, and feel that I may depend upon your aid.|$|R
60|$|Very {{considerably}} fagged out {{we arrived}} in town at 9 o'clock <b>at</b> night, <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the lead--for when my horse finally {{came to understand that}} he was homeward bound and hadn't far to go, he turned his attention strictly to business.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am equally gratified and vexed at all this; gratified and {{infinitely}} flattered to {{find that}} I have not passed before your eyes like the common herd, who leave no traces of even their features behind them; and vexed <b>at</b> finding <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> a situation that, I fear, you fancy excessively ridiculous?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Schwarzenegger took to {{visiting a}} gym in Graz, {{where he also}} frequented the local movie theaters to see {{bodybuilding}} idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: [...] "As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed {{me a sense of}} what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve." [...] In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. [...] "It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it." [...] When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: [...] "I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I used to cry {{sometimes}} when I looked <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the glass as a child," [...] she confessed. [...] "My hands {{were the only}} thing that consoled me." ...|$|E
60|$|I looked <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> {{the little}} gilt mirror over the mantel-piece. Perhaps because I looked, {{thinking}} {{of myself as}} I {{had been in the}} days before these strange happenings had come into my life, I answered his question promptly.|$|E
60|$|I am {{filled with}} deep emotion <b>at</b> finding <b>myself</b> {{standing}} <b>in</b> this place, where were collected together the wisdom, the patriotism, the devotion to principle, from which sprang the institutions under which we live.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a present}} from Lucius," [...] said the other, [...] "and as such must be used. But I shall never feel <b>myself</b> <b>at</b> home <b>in</b> my own carriage." ...|$|R
60|$|But in {{my passion}} I held her, despite entreaties, threats, and struggles. I was brutal, if you will. Yet {{think of what}} was in my soul at being so misjudged, <b>at</b> finding <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> this position, and deal not over harshly with me. The courage to confess which I had lacked for days, came to me then. I must tell her. Let the result be what it might, {{it could not be}} worse than this, and this I could endure no longer.|$|R
6000|$|I laughed <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> turn. [...] "Upon my word, Hilda," [...] I cried, [...] "I {{set out to}} find you. Beyond {{the desire}} to find you, I had no plan in my head. That was an end in itself. My {{thoughts}} went no farther." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And, also, I never confessed," [...] she said, [...] "on {{that same}} occasion, what I must now own to: that I opened the japanned box, {{and took out}} that strange-looking wig inside it, {{and put it on}} and looked <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the glass in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Greatly cheered by the idea, I {{seized the}} hair-brushes and looking <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the glass {{began to use}} them. Suddenly a hush fell upon the noise outside, and I heard (the ports of my cabin were thrown open)--I heard a deep calm voice, not on board my ship, however, hailing resolutely in English, but with a strong foreign twang, [...] "Go ahead!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I? I believe I {{was about}} as young when you were born. But I don't think <b>at</b> all about <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> this matter. I am too old to care to change my manner of living. It won't affect me very much. Indeed, I hardly know yet how it may affect me. Your mother thinks I ought {{to give up the}} living. If you were in orders, Harry--" ...|$|R
6000|$|I need {{scarcely}} {{say that}} I {{felt a little}} awkward <b>at</b> finding <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the streets of New York in such a guise; but the gravity and self-possession of my uncle were {{a constant source of}} amusement to me. He actually sold a watch on the wharf before the boat left it, though I imputed his success to the circumstance that his price was what a brother dealer, who happened to be trading in the same neighborhood, pronounced [...] "onconscionably low." [...] We took a comfortable state-room between us, under the pretence of locking up our property, and strolled about the boat, gaping and looking curious, as became our class.|$|R
6000|$|... "None whatever, sir," [...] Mr. John Effingham coldly answered. [...] "All the state-rooms are in common, and I {{propose to}} seize an early {{occasion}} to return this compliment, by making <b>myself</b> <b>at</b> home <b>in</b> the apartment {{which has the}} honour to lodge Mr. Dodge and Sir George Templemore." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{turned my}} back on Tom, and winked <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> a mirror. I heard him moving, and I turned again quickly. I didn't want a hundred and ninety-eight pounds falling on me from the rear. But Tom had only turned partly over, and laid one arm across his face. He spoke a few words rather more {{distinctly}} than before.|$|E
60|$|When I had {{finished}} looking <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the shield, I leaned upon the parapet {{staring at the}} sea and wondering how the plains of Aar looked that night beneath this selfsame moon, and whether Freydisa were dead by now, and whom Iduna had married, and if she ever thought of me, or if Steinar came to haunt her sleep.|$|E
60|$|Looking <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the restaurant's mirrors, {{it seemed}} to me that I had not much benefited by my week-end. Next morning I wrote out all my Holmescroft notes at fullest length, in the hope that by so doing I could put it all behind me. But the {{experience}} worked on my mind, as they say certain imperfectly understood rays work on the body.|$|E
5000|$|On her 100th {{birthday}} Schütte-Lihotzky commented [...] "You'll {{be surprised}} that, before I conceived the Frankfurt Kitchen in 1926, I never cooked <b>myself.</b> <b>At</b> home <b>in</b> Vienna my mother cooked, in Frankfurt I {{went to the}} Wirthaus restaurant/pub. I designed the kitchen as an architect, not as a housewife [...] ".|$|R
6000|$|That I was {{concerned}} <b>at</b> finding <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> a strange place, without a farthing in my pockets--without hat, shoes or coat, is certain--but it is wonderful how little apprehension I felt. I knew nothing, and feared nothing. While licking the molasses, I told the boys my situation; and I {{met with a}} great deal of sympathy among them. The word passed from one to the other, that a [...] "poor English boy had lost his vessel, and did not know where to go to pass the night." [...] One promised me a supper; and, as for lodgings, the general opinion seemed to be, that I might find a berth under one of the butchers' stalls, in the adjacent market. I had different projects for myself, however.|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{answered}} me, {{not even}} a stir behind the door. Jacobus's house might have been made empty {{for me to make}} <b>myself</b> <b>at</b> home <b>in.</b> I did not call again. I had become aware of a great discouragement. I was mentally jaded, morally dejected. I turned to the garden again, sitting down with my elbows spread on the low balustrade, and took my head in my hands.|$|R
60|$|A wicked man! I {{had never}} beheld the {{handsome}} and fascinating Mr. Jennings, but I visualised him now; dark, like all villains, {{with a black}} moustache and snapping black eyes. He carried a cane. I always associated canes with villains. Whereupon I arose, groped for the matches, lighted the gas, and gazing <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the mirror was a little reassured to find nothing sinister in my countenance....|$|E
60|$|You see how I grin sometimes. I can't help that. But I {{can put it}} on a lot. I'm not bad, though. I look <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the glass. My {{mouth is}} funny, I know that, and it lops down, and my teeth are bad. You can tell a feeb {{anywhere}} by looking at his mouth and teeth. But that doesn't prove I'm a feeb. It's just because I'm lucky that I look like one.|$|E
6000|$|... "I left it behind, in pieces, on the thorns {{and rocks}} along {{a good many}} leagues of trail; but it wasn't extensive--when you travel in this country you have often to choose between food and clothes. It was {{obviously}} impossible to buy any more, but the day before we reached camp I made Crestwick cut my hair. After a look <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> Nasmyth's pocket-glass, I'm inclined {{to think he was}} unwarrantably proud of his success." ...|$|E
6000|$|As I {{turned the}} problem {{over in my}} mind, however, one phrase at last came back to me--a phrase which Hilda herself had let fall when we were debating a very similar point about poor Hugo Le Geyt: [...] "If I were in his place, {{what do you think}} I would do?--why, hide <b>myself</b> <b>at</b> once <b>in</b> the greenest {{recesses}} of our Carnarvonshire mountains." ...|$|R
60|$|I found Hemlock Jones {{in the old}} Brook Street lodgings, musing {{before the}} fire. With the freedom of an old friend I <b>at</b> once threw <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> my usual {{familiar}} attitude at his feet, and gently caressed his boot. I was induced {{to do this for}} two reasons: one, that it enabled me to {{get a good look at}} his bent, concentrated face, and the other, that it seemed to indicate my reverence for his superhuman insight. So absorbed was he even then, in tracking some mysterious clue, that he did not seem to notice me. But therein I was wrong--as I always was in my attempt to understand that powerful intellect.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a wonder}} I haven't done {{something}} desperate—I've been half mad since I said—Oh, Lettie, I was a damned fool and a wretch—I could have torn <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> two. I've {{done nothing but}} curse and rage <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> ever since. I feel as if I'd just come up out of hell. You don't know how thankful I am, Lettie, that you've not—oh—turned against me for what I said." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{then the}} {{moonlight}} flooded the cave, and there before me lay {{my own body}} {{as it had been}} lying all these hours, with the eyes staring toward the open ledge and the hands resting limply upon the ground. I looked first at my lifeless clay there upon the floor of the cave and then down <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> utter bewilderment; for there I lay clothed, and yet here I stood but naked as at the minute of my birth.|$|E
60|$|The {{first thing}} I had done on {{returning}} to the Palazzo Orsi was to strip myself of my purple and fine linen, shave my beard and moustache, cut my hair short, put on the clothes of a serving-man, and look <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> a mirror. If I had met in the street the image I saw I should have passed on without recognising it. Still I was not dissatisfied with myself, and I smiled as I {{thought that it would}} not be too extraordinary if a lady's wench lost her heart to such a serving-man.|$|E
60|$|Everything was {{arranged}} {{in the course}} of the following day, our wigs of themselves completely effecting all the disguises that were necessary. As for my uncle, he was nearly bald, and a wig was no great encumbrance; but my shaggy locks gave me some trouble. A little clipping, however, answered the turn; and I had a hearty laugh <b>at</b> <b>myself,</b> <b>in</b> costume, that afternoon, before Dunning's dressing-room glass. We got round the felony law, about being armed and disguised, by carrying no weapons but our tools in the way of trade.|$|E
6000|$|For I {{really had}} not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it had so bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning. The morning hurry and flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I had waited for Wemmick, his hint had come like a {{surprise}} at last. And now I began to wonder <b>at</b> <b>myself</b> for being <b>in</b> the coach, and to doubt whether I had sufficient reason for being there, and to consider whether I should get out presently and go back, and to argue against ever heeding an anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose very few hurried people are strangers. Still, the reference to Provis by name mastered everything. I reasoned as I had reasoned already without knowing it,--if that be reasoning,--in case any harm should befall him through my not going, how could I ever forgive myself! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here," [...] said he, [...] "ended {{the worst}} of my state; for now I could <b>at</b> least put <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the way of happiness; I could exert myself; I could do something. But to be waiting so long in inaction, and waiting only for evil, had been dreadful. Within the first five minutes I said, 'I will be at Bath on Wednesday,' and I was. Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and to arrive {{with some degree of}} hope? You were single. It was {{possible}} that you might retain the feelings of the past, as I did; and one encouragement happened to be mine. I could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man, at least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help often saying, 'Was this for me?'" ...|$|R
60|$|I kept my temper. My whole future depended, in all probability, on my {{not losing}} {{possession}} of <b>myself</b> <b>at</b> that moment. The {{time had come}} to put Mr. Bruff's theory to the test. In the breathless interest of trying that experiment, I moved round so as to place <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> front of her.|$|R
