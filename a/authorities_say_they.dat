"Crimes Unseen: Extrajudicial Executions in Bangladesh" also documents how the Rapid Action Battalion justify these killings as accidental or {{as a result of}} officers acting in self-defence, although in reality many victims are killed following their arrest. “Hardly a week goes by in Bangladesh without someone being shot by RAB with the <b>authorities</b> <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> were killed or injured in ‘crossfire’ or a ‘gun-fight’. However the authorities choose to describe such incidents, the fact remains that they are suspected unlawful killings,” said Abbas Faiz, Amnesty International’s Bangladesh Researcher.   Image - from report: Students protest against the arrest and alleged torture of journalist Masum Fakir by the Rapid Action Battalion, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, October 2009.   AP Photo / Pavel Rahma...|$|R

500|$|In {{spite of}} having {{provided}} Mengele with legal documents in {{his real name}} in 1956, thus enabling him to regularize his residency in Argentina, West Germany offered a reward for his capture. Ongoing newspaper coverage of his wartime activities (accompanied by photographs of the fugitive) led Mengele to relocate again in 1960. Former pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel put him {{in touch with the}} Nazi supporter Wolfgang Gerhard, who helped Mengele get across the border into Brazil. He stayed with Gerhard on his farm near São Paulo until more permanent accommodation was found with Hungarian expatriates Geza and Gitta Stammer. Helped by an investment from Mengele, the couple bought a farm in Nova Europa, and Mengele was given the job of manager. In 1962 the three bought a coffee and cattle farm in Serra Negra, with Mengele owning a half interest. Initially, Gerhard told the couple that Mengele's name was [...] "Peter Hochbichler", but they discovered his true identity in 1963. Gerhard convinced them not to report Mengele's location to the <b>authorities,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> could themselves get in trouble for harboring the fugitive. West Germany, tipped off to the possibility that Mengele had relocated there, widened its extradition request to include Brazil in February 1961.|$|R

Keyes reportedly broke into the Curriers' home on the night of June 8 and tied them up before driving to an abandoned farmhouse, where he shot Bill Currier before sexually assaulting and strangling Lorraine Currier. However, their bodies have not been found. Two years prior to the Curriers' deaths, Keyes hid a [...] "murder kit" [...] near their home, which included a handgun and various supplies. Keyes used these supplies during the murder of the Curriers.

5000|$|A liver-transplant {{registry}} system {{was established in}} Shanghai, in 2008, which allows the monitoring of the after-care of liver recipients; {{at the same time}} a nationwide proposal was announced that would allow people to note on their driving licence that they wish to donate their organs. Despite these initiatives the China Daily newspaper reported in August 2009 that approximately 65% of transplanted organs still came from death row prisoners, which has been described as [...] "not a proper source for organ transplants" [...] by Vice-Health Minister Huang Jiefu. China's first posthumous organ donation system was jointly launched in March 2010 by the Red Cross and the Ministry of Health. Huang Jiefu announced that the scheme, which will allow people to express their wishes on their driver's licences, would be trialled in 10 pilot regions including the cities of Tianjin, Wuhan and Shenzhen. Funds will be made available for the families of people who voluntarily donate their organs. Chinese <b>authorities</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> hope the pilot program's success will reduce the need to take organs from death row prisoners and stem the tide of black market organs. In 2012 China officials stated they plan to phase out organ harvesting of death-row inmates.|$|E

The alleged bribes reportedly totaled $789,851. Silvio Antonio Marques, a São Paulo state prosecutor confirmed the civil and criminal investigations to the Wall Street Journal and added that the reporting individual also provided documentation of the misconduct by Brookfield employees. A former Brookfield employee, who is being sued by Brookfield for embezzlement and is being investigated by Brazilian authorities, reported the alleged bribes to both the authorities in Brazil and to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

In June, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission informed Brookfield Asset Management that it had concluded its investigation and would not be bringing charges over alleged bribery in Brazil.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, when Israel assumed {{control of}} the area, it made a {{military}} census that erred, according to B'Tselem, by defining Nuaman's population as residents of the West Bank. Since {{the head of a}} clan resided in Um A-Talla, all the villagers were registered as belonging to that village, and Nuaman was erased from the Israeli map, being renamed Mazmuriya, a reference to a nearby Roman archaeological site. In consequence, they were issued with West Bank identity cards, as opposed to the Israeli identity cards that were distributed to other Palestinian residents in the now municipally unified area of Jerusalem. The oversight transformed most of the townsfolk overnight into illegal residents of the area under Israeli law. As of 2006, the population consisted of some 220 people, of whom an exiguous minority (10%) retained Jerusalem identity cards, having migrated there from neighbouring villages. The village was left undisturbed for over two decades. The lives and prospects of the Nuaman villagers have been affected since the mid 1990s by several developments. They were informed by the Jerusalem administration under Ehud Olmert in 1992/3 that no building would be permitted. A further threat arose with the establishment of the Israeli settlement of Har Homa in 1997, which then began to extend its growth over Nuaman's village land, and is planned to replace Nuaman itself. Secondly further confiscations were made to create a military zone. Thirdly, Israel requisitoned some 30 dunams of their land for the Mazmuriya trade terminal (2005), and fourthly, the Jerusalem Ring Road was routed in a way that cut through the hamlet. Finally, the Israeli Separation Barrier, which the Palestinians call the Apartheid Wall, girds the hamlet, cutting it off from Beit Sahour two hundred yards away. The barrier effectively cuts them off from the very West Bank where the Israeli <b>authorities</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> belong. Altogether the Wall spread over 2.89 km of the Nuaman-Khas village territory, confiscating 776 dunums of arable land and forest, while isolating Nuaman from its sister community. The Israeli authorities have over the past decades uprooted an estimated 1,000 olive trees, 150 grapevines and 1,000 stone-fruit trees from the joint Nuaman/Al-Khas lands.|$|E

40|$|Bikini Atoll {{has been}} {{reshaped}} through time according to Western mythologies regarding ‘‘deserted’ ’ islands. Geographers have increasingly recognized that landscapes {{are shaped by}} the ways human agents conceptualize places. Ideals that shape places are not only based on interpretations of a given place, however, but are also formed by the semiotic linking of representations of similar landscapes. Conceptualizations of Bikini Atoll en-abled the drastic alteration of the landscape by nuclear testing in the 1940 s and 1950 s as well as subsequent development projects such as the current tourism operation on the atoll. The information {{presented in this article}} stems from interview research conducted in the Marshall Islands in 2001 and 2002 as well as from a review of historical accounts of the atoll from 1945 to the present. The conceptualizations of Bikini Atoll held by members of the Bikinian community, U. S. military and government officials, other people living in the Marshall Islands, and visitors to the atoll explain the transformations of the atoll landscape. Going beyond the notion of landscapes as readable texts, places can be understood as discursive-material formations where the semiotic meanings of places are intrinsically entwined with their reproduction. Key Words: place, landscape, nuclear testing, semiotics, tourism. As for Juda of Bikini and his people, now living on Rongerik Atoll, they probably will be repatriated if they insist on it, though United States military <b>authorities</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> can’t see why they should want to: Bikini and Rongerik look as alike as two Idaho potatoes. —(E.
