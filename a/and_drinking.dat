40|$|Background:  Heavy <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> smoking during {{pregnancy}} {{are known to}} {{have a negative impact on}} the unborn child. However, the impact of low-to-moderate alcohol consumption <b>and</b> binge <b>drinking</b> has been debated recently. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of moderate prenatal <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> binge <b>drinking</b> with birthweight, being small for gestational age (SGA) at birth, preterm birth, and neonatal asphyxia. Methods:  Moderate alcohol <b>drinking,</b> binge <b>drinking,</b> <b>and</b> several possible confounders were assessed in 1, 258 pregnant women; information on neonatal health was obtained at birth. Results:  Results indicate that 30. 8 % of the women drank at low levels ( 6. 35  mmol and/or Apgar score < 7 at 5  minutes). When controlling for maternal age, citizenship, occupational status, parity, smoking, use of prescription/over-the-counter drugs, illicit drug use, and child gender moderate drinking was related to lower birthweight (p <  0. 01), <b>and</b> moderate <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> binge <b>drinking</b> were associated with neonatal asphyxia at trend level (p =  0. 06 and p =  0. 09).

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effects of}} beer prices, alcohol availability, and policies related to {{driving under the influence}} of alcohol on <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> binge <b>drinking</b> among youths <b>and</b> young adults. Data are from a nationally representative survey of students in U. S. colleges and universities. Separate estimates are obtained for underage male and female students, as well as for older male and female students. The estimates indicate that the drinking practices of male college students are generally insensitive to the price of beer. However, underage <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> binge <b>drinking</b> by female students do respond significantly to price, although both are relatively inelastic. The results also show that strong drunk driving policies targeting youths and young adults significantly reduce <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> binge <b>drinking</b> by male students. Similarly, these policies reduce drinking among female college students but appear to have little impact on their binge drinking. Instead, the results indicate that many elements of campus life (including participation in a fraternity or sorority, living on campus, and the ready availability of alcoholic beverages) are among the most important determinants of <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> binge <b>drinking</b> among college students.

Specifically, manner of drinking moderated the relationships such that among students with high impulsive sensation seeking, those using strategies related to how they drink (e. g. avoiding rapid <b>and</b> excessive <b>drinking)</b> reported lower levels of binge <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> alcohol-related consequences than those using fewer of these strategies.

40|$|Although the {{relationship}} between religiosity-spirituality and risky alcohol use {{is one of the}} most frequently studied topics in mental health, relatively little is known about how these variables relate to each other over time, especially during specific developmental periods such as the transition from high school to college. This study analyzed three waves of self-report data collected from a sample (N= 623) of college students over a two-year period. Analyses examined (1) the stability of religiosity-spirituality <b>and</b> risky <b>drinking</b> over the transition to college, (2) the magnitude and direction of relationships between religiosity-spirituality <b>and</b> risky <b>drinking,</b> (3) the degree to which third variables account for relationships between religiosity-spirituality <b>and</b> risky <b>drinking,</b> <b>and</b> (4) the degree to which observed relationships between religiosity-spirituality <b>and</b> risky <b>drinking</b> extend to multiple, alternative measures of these constructs. Religiosity-spirituality <b>and</b> risky <b>drinking</b> demonstrated a high degree of stability over the transition to college. Consistent with previous literature, religiosity-spirituality predicted risky drinking, but risky drinking did not predict religiosity-spirituality. Relationships between religiosity-spirituality <b>and</b> risky <b>drinking</b> were observed across multiple alternative measures of the constructs and remained significant even after controlling for race and conduct disorder symptoms. In conclusion, religiosity-spirituality is a stable and important correlate and predictor of risky drinking, as well as a potential target for prevention and intervention during the transition to college...|$|R

This study evaluated the perception of social norms in youngsters during early adolescence (13 - 15 years) and the contribution of these norms to heavy <b>and</b> problem <b>drinking</b> over a 4 -year period. Adolescents (N = 428; 205 boys) participated in a prospective study with 5 annual waves.

Descriptive norms of the proximal reference group also predicted problem drinking in late adolescence. This study demonstrates the role of social norms in the prediction of heavy <b>and</b> problem <b>drinking</b> over time. Additionally, it illustrates the contribution of proximal rather than distal reference peers to heavy <b>and</b> problem <b>drinking</b> in late adolescence, and it suggests the relevance of targeting these norms in prevention research.

Weekend <b>and</b> weekday <b>drinking</b> volume scores were calculated from end-of-day reports of drinking across eight days. As expected, more drinking occurred during weekends.
