Several years later, Briosi and Cavara discovered the presence of setae on the fungus, reclassifying it from the Gloeosporium genus to Colletotrichum, where it remains today. Recognizing the devastating effect the fungus was having on common bean populations worldwide, it quickly became a heavily studied subject among scientists, who principally investigated means of controlling its spread. In 1911, Barrus reported the discovery of multiple fungal strains, each of which differed in its ability to infect certain varieties <b>of</b> <b>bean</b> plants, which initiated the work of Edgerton and Moreland, who found eleven different strains of the pathogen, but theorized more may exist.

Strains of C. lindemuthianum belonged to a single clade; we selected an authentic specimen as lectotype, and an appropriate specimen and culture from the CBS collection to serve as epitype.

Resistance inducers, commercially formulated microorganisms, non-formulated selected strains of different microorganisms (fungi, bacteria and yeasts) and plant extracts were applied as dry or liquid seed treatments on naturally infested seeds. Seedling emergence and disease incidence and/or severity were recorded. Almost all seed treatments turned out to be ineffective in controlling the Ascochyta infections, which is in line with the literature stating that these pathogens are difficult to control. The only alternative treatments that gave some control of Ascochyta spp. were thyme oil and a strain of Clonostachys rosea.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate the antifungal activities of plant extracts {{which can be used}} to control bean and cowpea anthracnose.

The same extracts were then tested for antifungal activity in vivo as seed treatments against anthracnose disease. The water extracts of Carica and Syzygium were active against C. lindemuthianum and had minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 1 · 56 mg/ml. Syzygium, Allium and Chlorophytum water extracts were active against C. dematium and MICs were 3 · 13, 6 · 25 and 12 · 5 mg/ml, respectively. The MICs of Allium, Syzygium and Agapanthus acetone extracts were 0 · 78, 3 · 13 and 6 · 25 mg/ml, respectively, against C. lindemuthianum and 0 · 78, 6 · 25 and 3 · 13 mg/ml against C. dematium. Agapanthus water extracts and all the acetone extracts tested in vivo effectively reduced the incidence and severity <b>of</b> <b>bean</b> <b>anthracnose</b> disease in the greenhouse. Agapanthus acetone, Allium water, and both acetone and water extracts of Carica and Syzygium performed well in vivo in reducing cowpea anthracnose disease and compared well with reductions due to the application of the synthetic fungicide fludioxonil+mefenoxam (the commercial product Celest® XL) applied at 25 gai/l and also with levels in the non-inoculated control.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to measure the quality attributes <b>of</b> cocoa <b>beans</b> including level <b>of</b> broken <b>beans,</b> bean waste (foreign matter), water content, and <b>bean</b> count (number <b>of</b> <b>beans</b> in 100 g) from Seven Regencies in South Sulawesi. Each regencies consist of 5 collector???s storage, sample of cocoa was 2 kg per collector, separated between whole beans,broken beans and bean waste, and then calculated their quality level. water content calculated by Sartorius AG MA 40 - 000 V 2 series number: 70501045 	The study indicates that quality attributes <b>of</b> cocoa <b>beans</b> had not yet met the standard set by Indonesian National Standard <b>of</b> Cocoa <b>beans</b> (SNI 01 - 2323 - 2002), except for the level <b>of</b> broken <b>beans.</b> Based on classes/categories <b>of</b> cocoa <b>beans</b> in SNI standard, due to the number <b>of</b> <b>beans</b> in 100 g bean weight, cocoa beans from Wajo, Bone and Sinjai included in class A, Soppeng and Polmas in class B, Luwu and Pinrang in class C...|$|R

This is suspected {{to be the}} cause of low quality coffee beans encountered by traders. This research aimed to characterize some engineering properties <b>of</b> coffee <b>beans</b> produced from wet process in respect to different colors of coffee cherries, and to especially highlight engineering properties <b>of</b> <b>beans</b> from green and deep red cherries. Non Factorial Simple Random Sampling Experimental Design was used for experiment and then ANOVA and DMRT 5 % of SPSS statistical package programs were employed to analyze the experimental data. The result of experiments indicated that some engineering properties varied among the beans from different colors of coffee cherries. The length, frontal area, weight <b>of</b> 1000 <b>beans,</b> porosity, density and true density <b>of</b> <b>beans</b> processed from green cherries, and weight <b>of</b> 1000 <b>beans</b> and angle <b>of</b> repose <b>of</b> <b>beans</b> produced from deep red cherries were significantly different from those <b>of</b> <b>beans</b> resulted from the other cherries. This finding suggested that the first 6 and the second 2 engineering properties might be elaborated to separate respectively coffee <b>beans</b> <b>of</b> green cherries and coffee <b>beans</b> <b>of</b> deep red cherries, from the other beans...|$|R
