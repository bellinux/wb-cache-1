40|$|PURPOSE:To {{investigate}} the accelerating effects of low-intensity pulse ultrasound stimulation (LIPUS) on the fracture healing of distal radius. METHODS:A total of 81 patients with distal radius fracture were randomly {{divided into two}} groups: the ultrasound treatment group and the control group. Patients in the ultrasound treatment group were immobilized in a below-elbow cast and received LIPUS treatment 15 min/day, while the control group were immobilized by a plaster support and cast. The patients were followed up every week <b>and</b> took <b>X-ray</b> <b>films.</b> The initial <b>and</b> healed <b>X-ray</b> <b>films</b> <b>and</b> the gray value of fracture site were analyzed by Photoshop software.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the techniques for silver recovery from radiographic waste; effluent <b>and</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>films.</b> The decline in silver natural resource {{has increased the}} cost of sourcing for pure silver.

The negative impact of pure silver on human and the environment is low but its soluble salt and emission from its recovery process pose a great risk to the ecosystem. Pyro-metallurgical processes of silver recovery requires heat > 950 °C which also destroys the polymer substrate. Hydrometallurgical processes such as electrolysis, metallic replacement, chemical precipitation and adsorption, are often used and provides high purity and efficiency.

40|$|Context: Jejunal diverticuli {{are rare}} and usually asymptomatic. More commonly, {{they are seen}} as {{incidental}} findings on CT images, enteroclysis, or during surgery. Complications such as bleeding, perforation, obstruction, malabsorption, diverticulitis, blind loop syndrome, volvulus, and intussusceptions may warrant surgical intervention. Case report: We report a case of 47 -year old woman who had suffered from intestinal obstruction for 3 days. The symptoms did not improve after conservative treatment. An exploratory laparotomy found small bowel obstruction due to proximal jejunal diverticulum with an adhesion epiploic band. Strangulation of the jejunum resulted from the internal hernia caused by the band. The band was removed and the proximal jejunum segmentally resected. The postoperative course was uneventful. Conclusion: Although this phenomenon is rare, we {{should keep in mind}} that intestinal diverticulosis may induce intestinal obstructions of different kinds, repeat physical examinations <b>and</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>films</b> are needed <b>and</b> enteroclysis studies or CT scan are helpful in diagnosis.

The first stage is process-oriented and produces {{a limited number of}} intermediate products. The second stage is. ow shop oriented and splits up the intermediate products into {{a very large number of}} end products. The objective is to develop an integrated repetitive cyclic master production plan, minimising the total set-up and inventory holding costs of the work-in-process and end products. The problem corresponds with solving the capacitated lot sizing problem in a two-stage, multi-product environment under the additional constraint of repetitive cyclic production schedules.
