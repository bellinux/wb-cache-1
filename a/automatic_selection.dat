The International Fencing Federation's rules call for events not held in the previous Games to receive <b>automatic</b> <b>selection</b> and {{for at least one}} team event in each weapon to be held. Voting is conducted to determine the fourth event. In 2004, the three men's team events and the women's épée were held. Thus, in 2008, the women's foil and sabre events and men's épée were automatically selected. Men's sabre was chosen over foil by a 45–20 vote.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa, Harvey embarrassed the Board of Control when he frankly discussed his financial situation during a television interview. He {{revealed that the}} players earned only £85 per Test {{and that he was}} almost broke, despite being an <b>automatic</b> <b>selection</b> for Australia. Ten years of making time for cricket had disrupted his working life, so he was contemplating a move to South Africa, the homeland of his wife, Iris. Consequently, Harvey received a job offer to work as a sales supervisor for a glass manufacturer in Sydney, so he moved to New South Wales and gave up the Victorian captaincy. As a new player to NSW, he was behind vice-captain Richie Benaud in the state's pecking order, despite being the Test vice-captain, ahead of Benaud. Fatefully, Craig was unfit {{for the start of the}} 1958–59 season, due to the after-effects of hepatitis.|$|E

He confirmed his selection with 182 in a Test trial, an innings regarded by many as the best he had ever played. Another scare with illness saw him hospitalised in Adelaide after the Christmas match against South Australia, missing the next two state matches. His health problems continued after an operation to remove his tonsils; a procedure that was arranged by the Australian Board of Control despite Jackson never having previously suffered any problems with his tonsils. Bill Ponsford had suffered from tonsillitis during the previous tour and the Board were anxious to avoid similar occurrences. Complications resulting from the operation saw Jackson lose a stone (6.4 kilograms) in weight.|$|E

5|$|As a result, Lindwall was {{selected}} as part of Sir Donald Bradman's Invincibles that toured England without defeat in 1948. There were two concerns for Lindwall in the lead-up {{to the start of}} the tour. Lindwall was carrying an injured leg tendon and his foot drag in the delivery stride led to murmurings in the media and among umpires as to its legality. Bradman arranged for Lindwall to see his Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who had Lindwall's leg back to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front. Bradman stated his firm belief that Lindwall's delivery was fair. During the lengthy boat journey to England, Bradman emphasized to Lindwall the importance of caution with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to keep his dragging rear right foot even further than usual, to avoid being no-balled, and to avoid bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his action. Bradman assured Lindwall that he was an <b>automatic</b> <b>selection</b> for the Tests even if he did not take a wicket in the lead-in tour matches, telling him that being passed by the umpires was the first priority. Bradman recalled how Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 tour, destroying his confidence. Lindwall was not no-balled in the first match at Worcester, and so it remained for the rest of the tour.|$|E

The <b>automatic</b> model <b>selection</b> is a software feature routinely used by many companies in their forecasting, for instance in sales planning. Our empirical tests are based on data for time series showing trend, seasonal and trend-seasonal patterns. We use this data first in its "pure", unaltered form. Afterwards, we add varying amounts of normally-distributed noise to see how this affects the quality of model selection and the forecasting result. We, thereby, mimic real-time data quality which very seldom {{comes in the form of}} undisturbed trends, seasonal or other patterns. Our findings indicate that <b>automatic</b> model <b>selection</b> should be used with care, and that some planners should reconsider their rather unreflective attitude towards <b>automatic</b> model <b>selection</b> in practical forecasting.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{reinforcement}} learning methodology for <b>automatic</b> online algorithm <b>selection</b> is introduced and empirically tested. It is applicable to <b>automatic</b> algorithm <b>selection</b> methods that predict {{the performance of}} each available algorithm and then pick the best one. The experiments confirm {{the usefulness of the}} methodology: using online data results in better performance. As in many online learning settings an exploration vs. exploitation trade-off, synonymously learning vs. earning trade-off, is incurred. Empirically investigating the quality of classic solution strategies for handling this trade-off in the <b>automatic</b> online algorithm <b>selection</b> setting is the secondary goal of this paper. The <b>automatic</b> online algorithm <b>selection</b> problem can be modelled as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem. Two classic strategies for solving this problem are tested in the context of automatic online algorithm selection: epsilon-greedy and lower confidence bound. The experiments show that a simple purely exploitative greedy strategy outperforms strategies explicitly performing exploration. status: publishe...|$|R

In case-based reasoning system, previously deployed applications are used to help in selection of services for new applications. Using a set of similarity functions (local and global similarity functions) the similarity of the target application’s requirements and preferences to the applications already in the case base is calculated and the top most similar ones are used to recommend a list of solutions (services) for the target application. The discovered solutions are then adapted to the requirements and preferences of the target application.|$|R

25|$|When Lindsay Hassett {{retired after}} the 1953 Ashes Series his vice-captain Arthur Morris was not {{appointed}} {{to succeed him}} because he was not a state captain. In 1954-55 Australia had not played a Test series since and the selectors were divided as to who should be captain. As with everything else down under cricket was divided between the power centres of Sydney, New South Wales and Melbourne, Victoria. The fast bowling all-rounder Keith Miller was captain of New South Wales and the winner of the 1954-55 Sheffield Shield. He had the obvious advantage of being an <b>automatic</b> <b>selection</b> for the Australian team, and was a charismatic and inspirational leader on the field. Against him was his cavalier approach to the game and that he was little inclined to enforce discipline. His rival was the captain of Victoria, the off-spinner Ian Johnson. Johnson had been little used on the 1948 tour and was left behind in 1953 and was not an <b>automatic</b> <b>selection</b> for the Test team. However, {{he was the son of}} the Test selector William Johnson, had attended the elite Wesley College. Lindsay Hassett and the chairman of selectors Don Bradman favoured Johnson and he was appointed captain by the A.C.B.. Unlike Miller he was seen as a safe pair of hands and he was an astute captain and a fine ambassador for Australian cricket, but not everybody was happy with the choice. Frank Tyson reckoned that his innings victory in the First Test cost Australia the series as it confirmed Johnson in the captaincy, whereas Miller might have won the next three vital Tests. As it was vice-captain Arthur Morris was blamed for the defeat in Sydney and (strangely) Melbourne and the selectors stuck by Johnson. He went on to captain the successful Australian tour of the West Indies in 1954-55, where his diplomacy ensured that he did not suffer the same problems as Len Hutton in 1953-54, and his captaincy was considered to be equal to that of Richie Benaud. He retired after the Australian tour of England, Pakistan and India in 1956, where he again failed to regain the Ashes after being 1-0 up in the series.|$|E
25|$|During the 2002–03 season, Roberts captained the Norwich City team.

The season overall, however, was not a happy one for Roberts or Norwich. The Canaries faded after a good start to the season and failed to qualify for the play-offs, while Roberts scored just 7 goals in 47 games leading many supporters to believe that his best days were behind him. The 2003–04 season would be his last at Carrow Road and although he was no longer an <b>automatic</b> <b>selection</b> for the first team he played an important part in one of the club's best-ever seasons. The team won the division one championship in style and were promoted to the premiership. Roberts weighed in with some crucial goals, including the winning goal in a top-of-the-table match against Sheffield United. Roberts revealed in his autobiography that in February of that season he had a cancer scare and had to have a malignant melanoma removed from his arm.|$|E
25|$|Hobbs was an <b>automatic</b> <b>selection</b> for the MCC tour of Australia in {{the winter}} of 1911–12, and in {{previewing}} the series, former Australian captain Harry Trott saw Hobbs as the key batsman. Hobbs once more suffered from sea-sickness on the journey, even travelling by land to meet the team's ship at Marseilles to reduce his time on the water. After scoring 43 when the team stopped in Colombo on the way, Hobbs and the MCC arrived in Australia in October 1911. The side faced immediate difficulties when their captain, Pelham Warner became seriously ill shortly after scoring 151 in the opening game. Warner named Johnny Douglas his replacement as leader, a decision which pleased the team and Hobbs, an admirer of Douglas, in particular. However, several leading batsmen struggled for form in the opening games, including Hobbs. Affected by sunstroke, Hobbs highest score, and only fifty, in seven innings before the Tests began was 88. Nor did Douglas' captaincy convince Australian critics at first. Problems continued during the first Test, which Australia won by 146 runs, and Douglas faced severe criticism of his leadership. Hobbs scored 63 in the first innings, although by his own admission he did not play well, and 22 in the second. Although Rhodes was in the team, he did not open the batting owing to his poor form, and Hobbs opened with Septimus Kinneir.|$|E
