Speaking there, Attorney General and Minister of Justice Ba Tambadou said that justice should prevail for the victims and families of those killed. He said that the Barrow government would try everything in its power {{to find out who}} gave the order to shoot the protesters and bring them to justice.|$|E
25|$|Surviving {{accounts}} of the expedition differ on when Baret's gender was first discovered. According to Bougainville, rumors that Baret was a woman had circulated for some time, but her gender was not finally confirmed until the expedition reached Tahiti in April 1768. As soon as she and Commerson landed on shore to botanize, Baret was immediately surrounded by Tahitians who cried {{out that she was}} a woman. It was necessary to return her to the ship to protect her from the excited Tahitians. Bougainville recorded this incident in his journal some weeks <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened,</b> when he had an opportunity to visit the Étoile to interview Baret personally.|$|E

[...] "As far as the kiss, any doubt she may have had about her relationship with Bianca dissolved immediately <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened.</b> It was a moment of needing a connection. It was not about being in love with Zach. She was drunk, upset, and it was unfortunate. It was a terrible mistake. As far as I am concerned, Reese has always been in love with Bianca." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the murder}} of Virgil Starks nine weeks later, Hollis and Larey {{declared}} that their attacker was the same person who killed the other five victims. Hollis said, [...] "I think {{the man is a}} young white man; under thirty years old." [...] He also stated, [...] "I know he's crazy. The crazy things he said made me feel that his mind was warped," [...] and [...] "Evidently he thought he had killed me that night. Right <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened,</b> I told the deputy sheriff and the city attorney that that man was dangerous. He is a potential murderer. The next person he gets will be killed. It wasn't long after that when the first two bodies were found out on West Seventh street. I think there are three people alive today who escaped from that man. The woman who is in the hospital now , Mrs. Larey and I." ...|$|E
5000|$|Opponents of the {{organization}} often argue that it should instead focus on addiction treatment or lobbying for government health care.

Those resources we do have are spent to prevent a problem for $300 rather than paying millions <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> in cost to care for a potentially damaged child."

2500|$|In 1996, Hayden Ebbern, Sean Mulligan and Barry Beyerstein {{visited the}} Medical Center to {{investigate}} the story. They placed a tennis shoe on the same ledge and discovered that the shoe was visible from within the building and could have easily been observed by a patient lying in bed. They also discovered the shoe was easily observable from outside the building and suggested that Maria may have overheard a comment about it during her three {{days in the hospital}} and incorporated it into her OBE. They concluded [...] "Maria's story merely reveals the naiveté and the power of wishful thinking" [...] from OBE researchers seeking a paranormal explanation. Clark did not publish the description of the case until seven years <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened,</b> casting doubt on the story. Richard Wiseman has said that although the story is not evidence for anything paranormal it has been [...] "endlessly repeated by writers who either couldn’t be bothered to check the facts, or were unwilling to present their readers with the more skeptical side of the story." ...|$|E
2500|$|News of {{the crash}} was {{reported}} in mainland Chinese media shortly <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened,</b> but the story was then rapidly suppressed. Reportedly, Ling Jihua, after viewing {{the body of the}} driver at the morgue, denied it was his son. Ling was also said to have mobilized staff from the Central Security Bureau, an organ in charge of national leaders' security which reported into the General Office, to cover up the crash. Chinese media also reported that Ling had contacted Zhou Yongkang, then chief of the powerful Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, to reach unspecified [...] "political deals" [...] in exchange for assistance on covering up the death of his son. Ling then went on to work as normal. In China, Internet search terms such as [...] "Ferrari", [...] "Little Ling" [...] and [...] "Prince Ling" [...] were blocked. In November 2012, an 'exclusive' from the South China Morning Post reported that Jiang Jiemin, a former associate of Zhou Yongkang then serving as chief executive of China National Petroleum Corporation, wired money from the company's accounts {{to the families of the}} two women involved in the crash to keep silent about the crash.|$|E
2500|$|... 1999–2000 {{was one of}} {{the most}} tumultuous seasons in {{franchise}} history and the tumult actually started three months prior to the start of the regular season. In the span of a few days in July, longtime broadcaster Gene Hart died due to illness and defenseman Dmitri Tertyshny, coming off his rookie season, was fatally injured in a freak boating accident. Head Coach Roger Neilson was diagnosed with bone cancer, forcing him to step aside in February 2000 to undergo treatment, so Assistant Coach Craig Ramsay took over as interim coach for the rest of the season; Neilson later recovered but was informed that he would not return. In January, longtime Flyer and fan favorite Rod Brind'Amour was shipped to the Carolina Hurricanes for Keith Primeau, with the intention of acquiring a big center to complement Lindros. Meanwhile, the strife between Flyers management (particularly Clarke) and Lindros, continued to worsen. Less than a month after Ramsay took over, Lindros suffered his second concussion of the season. He played several games after the initial hit and afterwards criticized the team's training staff for failing to initially diagnose the concussion <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened.</b> It was after this that the Flyers' organization decided to strip Lindros of the captaincy on March 27 and name defenseman Eric Desjardins the team's captain.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} the business transaction results in a higher potential risk in terms of SLA violation. The fulfillment of the QoS constraints specified in global SLA can be threatened at any time by different unexpected events that could occur during the execution of a business transaction. Unfortunately, there is no solution found that can efficiently mitigate this risk. Some of the current business transaction monitoring and managing solutions can monitor business transaction and report fault only <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens.</b> The framework proposed in this paper, monitors business transactions, computes potential risks and performs proactively adaptation actions {{in order to avoid}} global SLA violation that could causes transaction abortion...|$|R
50|$|On the lam, the duo {{look for}} a {{blacksmith}} who can remove their cuffs. They are freed, but <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens,</b> Gina is alone and forlorn. She starts crying and admits to Bart that she has no family. The police come and arrest them (and a bear that Cletus said would attack Chief Wiggum), telling the Simpsons that now Bart will stay in Juvie even longer. Gina, feeling terrible, confesses that she was behind the escape, clearing Bart of further charges. The Simpsons and the warden step in to help Gina feel better for being without family, offering a Mexican food feast in her cell at the end.|$|R

60|$|But, unhappily, {{there was}} alacrity enough in another quarter.

50|$|The {{way people}} view {{stillbirths}} {{has changed dramatically}} over time, however its economic and psychosocial impact is often under estimated. In the early 20th century, when a stillbirth occurred, the baby was taken and discarded and the parents were expected to immediately {{let go of the}} attachment and try for another baby. In many countries parents are expected by friends and family members to recover from the loss of an unborn baby very soon <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens.</b> Societally-mediated complications such as financial hardship and depression are among the more common results. A stillbirth can have significant psychological impacts on the parents, notably causing feelings of guilt in the mother.|$|R

With this method, we build a cache with the domain name and the IP. With this cache, domain name can be detected if DSN hijacking happens in DNS cache server and this system can detect domain name hijacking efficiently <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens...</b>|$|R
60|$|Galt called.--Mem.--to {{ask some}} one {{to speak to}} Raymond in favour of his play. We are old fellow-travellers, and, with all his eccentricities, he has much strong sense, {{experience}} of the world, and is, as far as I have seen, a good-natured philosophical fellow. I showed him Sligo's letter on the reports of the Turkish girl's aventure at Athens soon <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened.</b> He and Lord Holland, Lewis, and Moore, and Rogers, and Lady Melbourne have seen it. Murray has a copy. I thought it had been unknown, and wish it were; but Sligo arrived only some days after, and the rumours {{are the subject of}} his letter. That I shall preserve,--it is as well. Lewis and Gait were both horrified; and L. wondered I did not introduce the situation into The Giaour. He may wonder;--he might wonder more at that production's being written at all. But to describe the feelings of that situation were impossible--it is icy even to recollect them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{have a very}} {{extraordinary}} {{story to}} tell you. You know, of course, that Alfred had an uncle, Stephen Monkton. Well, some time ago this uncle fought a duel in the Roman States with a Frenchman, who shot him dead. The seconds and the Frenchman (who was unhurt) took to flight in different directions, as it is supposed. We heard nothing here {{of the details of}} the duel till a month <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened,</b> when one of the French journals published an account of it, taken from the papers left by Monkton's second, who died at Paris of consumption. These papers stated {{the manner in which the}} duel was fought, and how it terminated, but nothing more. The surviving second and the Frenchman have never been traced from that time to this. All that anybody knows, therefore, of the duel is that Stephen Monkton was shot; an event which nobody can regret, for a greater scoundrel never existed. The exact place where he died, and what was done with the body are still mysteries not to be penetrated." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{hands were}} now called to get both the boats afloat, {{and there was}} {{certainly}} no time to be lost. The water rose over the cabin-floor while we were doing it. We did not stand to get up tackles, but cut away the rail and launched the long-boat by hand. We got the passengers, men, women, children, and servants into her, as fast as possible, and followed ourselves. Fortunately, {{there had been a}} brig in company for some time, and she was now less than two leagues ahead of us, outsailing the Belle Savage a little. We had hoisted our ensign, union down, as a signal of distress, and well knew she must see that our craft had sunk, <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened,</b> if she did not observe our ensign. She perceived the signal, however, and could not fail to notice {{the manner in which the}} brig was all adrift, as soon as we deserted the helm. The strange brig had hauled up for us even before we got out the launch. This rendered any supply of food or water unnecessary, and we were soon ready to shove off. I was in the small boat, with three men. We pulled off a little distance, and lay looking at our sinking craft with saddened eyes. Even the gold, that precious dust which lures so many souls to eternal perdition, was abandoned in the hurry to save the remnants of lives to be passed on earth. The Belle Savage settled quite slowly into the ocean, one sail disappearing after another, her main-royal being the last thing that went out of sight, looking like the lug of a man-of-war's boat on the water. It is a solemn thing to see a craft thus swallowed up in the great vortex of the ocean.|$|E
50|$|The film {{begins in}} 1888, with Billy having {{been dead for}} fifteen years, {{and the story of}} his life on Earth (from his first meeting with Julie at the {{carousel}} to his death) is made into a flashback that takes up three-quarters of the film. Billy tells his own story to the Starkeeper in order to receive permission to return to Earth for one day, which he was offered when he first arrived and turned down. This last change was made to safeguard against the movie audience's being surprised at the death of Billy, and to prevent them from leaving the movie theatre directly <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> in case they thought the story ended at that point.|$|R
