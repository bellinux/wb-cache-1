5000|$|Despite Musacco {{already left}} the club, Roma {{had set up}} a special <b>amortise</b> fund <b>to</b> <b>amortise</b> the toxic player asset in 10-year period since 2002-03 season. The special law was allowed the club <b>to</b> <b>amortise</b> <b>to</b> {{transfer}} fee regardless the players was still in the squad or not, which Musacco value was split into €720,000 <b>to</b> <b>amortise</b> normally according <b>to</b> the length of the contract, and €1.78 million to the special fund. The fund which still had an asset [...] "value" [...] of nearly €80 million on 30 June 2006, was removed in the start of 2006-07 financial year, which also made the net equity decreased €80 million immediately.

50|$|For the 2009-10 season, Mantova was {{guided by}} former Italian {{international}} Michele Serena. The financial situation of the club was deteriorated, which the club raised the short term profit by player exchange, but also raised the long term amortisation cost. The club had swapped Stefano Mondini with Christian Jidayi on 30 June 2008 in co-ownership deal for €750,000, made the clubs had player selling revenue of €1.5 million. June 2009 also saw Jidayi return to Cesena and Mondini back to Mantova; 50% of both players' rights were valued at €750,000. However, it became a financial burden for both clubs, which Mantova had <b>to</b> <b>amortise</b> Mondini's value (€1.5 million) in instalments as amortisation. In June 2008 Mantova also swapped Valerio Di Cesare (€1M) and Simone Calori (€0.5M) with Riccardo Fissore (€0.5M) and Mattia Marchesetti (€1M). Again, Mantova had <b>to</b> <b>amortise</b> €0.5M in for 3 seasons for Fissore (€166,667) and Marchesetti (€333,333).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a quantitative concept for bisimulations by integrating {{the notion of}} amortisation (cf. [3]). This allows us to make behavioural comparisons between nondeterministic systems that are inherently non-terminating and to analyse the relative long-term costs of deploying them. To this end, we conservatively extend CCS to include {{a new set of}} cost-based actions and define a cost-based quantitative relation called amortised bisimulation. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by two case studies. In both cases the cost of additional administration is shown <b>to</b> <b>amortise.</b> We furthermore show that the amortised preorder for speed introduced in [6] is naturally expressible in our setting. ...|$|R

This paper examines the relationship between international business activities and firm performance using a sample of about 200 young high-tech firms in Germany and the UK that were contacted by two surveys in 1997 and 2003.

5000|$|The {{bodies were}} {{manufactured}} {{in what was}} becoming a rather old fashioned manner, with the structural strength coming from a timber frame over which steel panels were fitted. [...] By this time competitor vehicles from volume automakers such as the Peugeot 402 and Citroën Traction were coming with all-steel bodies formed from sheet steel using heavy presses, and {{without the need for}} any separate structural frame underneath the panels. The all-steel car bodies could be more curvaceously styled and, given sufficient volumes, more cheaply produced, but Berliet sold fewer than 10,000 Dauphines, and this would have fallen far short of the volumes necessary <b>to</b> <b>amortise</b> the high capital costs involved with heavy steel presses and dies for stamping body panels.|$|R
40|$|Using Danish {{household}} level data, we {{find that}} a relatively large share of total interest-only mortgage debt is held by families with few liquid assets and high loan to value ratios. This may arise because families with interest-only loans do not fully use the lower instalments to increase their savings or <b>to</b> <b>amortise</b> more expensive debt. This is in particular {{the case for the}} families who choose interest-only loans with a variable interest rate, which is the most common loan type in Denmark, and the largest difference is found for those families who have the lowest savings propensity, and those with a high loan to value ratio. Furthermore, first time borrowers choosing interest-only loans take loans of higher initial sizes and have higher loan to value ratios than first time borrowers choosing amortising loans...|$|R

5000|$|Up {{until the}} early 1990s, a number of local {{authorities}} had been engaged in interest rate swap transactions as part of managing their debt portfolios. Under the Local Authorities Act 1972, the local authorities had power to borrow in order <b>to</b> <b>amortise</b> their costs of capital projects {{over a longer period}} of time. In connection with that borrowing, certain local authorities sought to enter into swap transactions to hedge their exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. There were some doubts as to the ability of local authorities to enter into such transactions, but the local authorities sought the opinion of Anthony Scrivener QC, a leading commercial silk, who had advised that if a [...] "rate swap is undertaken as part of the proper management of the council's fund then ... the swap will be intra vires" [...] within the powers of the council.|$|R
5000|$|Despite Chelsea's {{intermediate}} holding company, [...] "Chelsea FC plc", {{making a}} sight improvement in its accounts {{with a net}} loss of £67.7 million for the 2010-11 season, the effect of the increase in intangible <b>assets</b> led <b>to</b> a higher cost in the future. As transfer fee was considered as a purchase of a capital, the real effect of transfer fee was the amortisation of the transfer fee, which is proportionally to the contract length. For example, Fernando Torres' £50 million transfer fee had <b>to</b> be <b>amortised</b> by about £9 million a season, which in the 2010-11 season amounted to only £4.5 million (due to half season). The club may lower the expense of amortisation by selling players and extending the player contract.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{selection}} of accounting policies for intangible assets in the Italian football industry, focusing {{on the effects of}} the so-called salva calcio decree. Introduced by the Italian government, the decree effectively permitted clubs <b>to</b> <b>amortise</b> the <b>asset</b> of players’ registration rights over an arbitrary time period of ten years rather than over the length of players’ contracts, thus improving clubs’ reported financial position and performance. While adoption of the salva calcio decree had no direct cash flow effect, it had indirect economic consequences. It is argued that adoption of this policy by some Italian clubs was motivated by a form of legitimacy theory, whereby clubs sought to legitimise their financial position and performance with a view to meeting the licensing demands of football governing bodies. It also highlights the difficulty stakeholders face when trying to understand a football club’s financial results. Far from being neutral, figures in financial statements are value-laden...|$|R
