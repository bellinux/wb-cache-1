5|$|An old {{qualitative}} {{test for}} the presence of the alkene functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a bromohydrin with some of the dibromoalkane also produced. The reaction passes through a short-lived strongly electrophilic bromonium intermediate. This {{is an example of a}} halogen <b>addition</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E

25|$|Alkenes {{react in}} many <b>addition</b> <b>reactions,</b> which occur by {{opening up the}} double-bond. Most of these <b>addition</b> <b>reactions</b> follow the {{mechanism}} of electrophilic addition.

25|$|Modern organic syntheses now {{require the}} {{synthesis}} of compounds in enantiopure form. Since the aldol <b>addition</b> <b>reaction</b> creates two new stereocenters, up to four stereoisomers may result.|$|E
25|$|The <b>addition</b> <b>reaction</b> with bromine {{does not}} require a catalyst. Borazines undergo {{nucleophilic}} attack at boron and electrophilic attack at nitrogen. Heating borazine at 70°C expels hydrogen with formation of a borazinyl polymer or polyborazylene, in which the monomer units are coupled in a para fashion by new boron-nitrogen bonds. Boron nitride can be prepared by heating polyborazylene to 1000°C. Borazines are also starting materials for other potential ceramics such as boron carbonitrides. Borazine can also be used as a precursor to grow boron nitride thin films on surfaces, such as the nanomesh structure which is formed on rhodium.|$|E
25|$|Lin and {{coworkers}} {{have shown that}} the postmodification of MOFs can be achieved to produce enantioselective homochiral MOFs for use as catalysts. The resulting 3D homochiral MOF {• 4DMF • 6MeOH • 3H2O} (L=(R)-6,6'-dichloro-2,2'-dihydroxyl-1,1'-binaphthyl-bipyridine) synthesized by Lin was shown to have a similar catalytic efficiency for the diethylzinc <b>addition</b> <b>reaction</b> as compared to the homogeneous analogue when was pretreated by Ti(OiPr)4 to generate the grafted Ti- BINOLate species. The catalytic activity of MOFs can vary depending on the framework structure. Lin and others found that MOFs synthesized from the same materials could have drastically different catalytic activities depending on the framework structure present.|$|E

40|$|Three alkyltitanium {{reagents}} of RTi(O-i-Pr) (3) (R = Cy (1 a), i-Bu (1 b), and n-Bu (1 c)) {{were prepared}} in good yields. The high-resolution mass spectroscopy showed that 1 b and 1 c {{in the gas}} phase are monomeric species. However, the solid state of 1 a revealed a dimeric structure. Asymmetric additions of 1 a- 1 c to aldehydes catalyzed by a titanium catalyst of (R) -H- 8 -BINOL were studied at room temperature. The reactions produced desired secondary alcohols in good yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities of up to 94 % ee. Reactivity and enantioselectivity differences, in terms of steric bulkiness of the R nucleophiles, are herein described. The <b>addition</b> <b>reactions</b> of secondary c-hexyl to aldehydes were slower than the reactions of primary i-butyl or n-butyl nucleophiles. For the primary alkyls, lower enantioselectivities were obtained for products from <b>addition</b> <b>reactions</b> of the linear n-butyl {{as compared with the}} enantioselectivities of products from the <b>addition</b> <b>reactions</b> of the branched i-butyl group. The same stereochemistry of RTi(O-i-Pr) (3) <b>addition</b> <b>reactions</b> as the <b>addition</b> <b>reactions</b> of organozinc, organoaluminum, Grignard, or organolithium reagents directly supports the argument of that titanium- catalyzed <b>addition</b> <b>reactions</b> of aldehydes involve an addition of an organotitanium nucleophile.

25|$|One common {{solution}} is to form the enolate of one partner first, and then add the other partner under kinetic control. Kinetic control means that the forward aldol <b>addition</b> <b>reaction</b> must be significantly faster than the reverse retro-aldol reaction. For this approach to succeed, two other conditions must also be satisfied; it must be possible to quantitatively form the enolate of one partner, and the forward aldol reaction must be significantly faster than {{the transfer of the}} enolate from one partner to another. Common kinetic control conditions involve the formation of the enolate of a ketone with LDA at −78°C, followed by the slow addition of an aldehyde.|$|E
25|$|A typical modern aldol <b>addition</b> <b>reaction,</b> shown above, {{might involve}} the {{nucleophilic}} {{addition of a}} ketone enolate to an aldehyde. Once formed, the aldol product can sometimes lose a molecule of water to form an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. This is called aldol condensation. A variety of nucleophiles may be employed in the aldol reaction, including the enols, enolates, and enol ethers of ketones, aldehydes, and many other carbonyl compounds. The electrophilic partner is usually an aldehyde or ketone (many variations, such as the Mannich reaction, exist). When the nucleophile and electrophile are different, the reaction is called a crossed aldol reaction; on the converse, when the nucleophile and electrophile are the same, the reaction is called an aldol dimerization.|$|E
25|$|Boranes react {{rapidly to}} alkenes {{in a process}} called hydroboration. This concept was {{discovered}} by Dr. Herbert Charles Brown, work for which he eventually received the Nobel Prize (jointly with Georg Wittig for his discovery of the Wittig reaction). Although diborane as a pure compound is a dimer, BH3 forms 1:1 complexes with basic solvents, for instance THF. In an ordinary electrophilic <b>addition</b> <b>reaction</b> of HX (X = Cl, Br, I, etc.), Markovnikov's rule, which states that the less electronegative atom, usually hydrogen, adds to the least substituted carbon of the double bond, this determines regioselectivity. With boranes the mode of action is the same, the hydrogen adds to the most substituted carbon because boron is less electronegative than hydrogen. When a positive charge develops in the alkene on the most substituted carbon atom, {{that is where the}} partially negatively charged hydrogen atom adds, leaving the least substituted carbon atom for the boron atom. The so-called anti-Markovnikov addition because when the boron is replaced with a hydroxyl group the overall reaction is addition of water over the double bond in what appears to be an anti-Makovnikov addition.|$|E
50|$|As a {{physical}} organic chemist, Nelson {{developed a new}} synthetically useful technique for gathering mechanistic information on <b>addition</b> <b>reactions</b> of alkenes.

2500|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} elimination reactions is those involving alkyl halides, with good leaving groups, reacting with a Lewis base {{to form an}} alkene.

2500|$|In hydrohalogenation, an alkene {{reacts with}} a dry {{hydrogen}} halide (HX) like hydrogen chloride (...) or hydrogen bromide (...) to form a mono-haloalkane. The double bond of the alkene is replaced by two new bonds, one with the halogen and one with the hydrogen atom of the hydrohalic acid. Markovnikov's rule states that in this reaction, the halogen {{is more likely to}} become attached to the more substituted carbon. This is an electrophilic <b>addition</b> <b>reaction.</b> Water must be absent otherwise there will be a side product of a halohydrin.

2500|$|The {{absence of}} lithium boryl {{compounds}} is notable because in other period 2 elements lithium salts are common e.g. lithium fluoride, lithium hydroxide lithium amide and methyllithium.

2500|$|Silane {{pyrolysis}} gives polymeric {{species and}} finally elemental silicon and hydrogen; indeed ultrapure silicon is commercially {{produced by the}} pyrolysis of silane. While the thermal decomposition of alkanes starts by the breaking of a C–H or C–C bond {{and the formation of}} radical intermediates, polysilanes decompose by eliminating silenes :SiH2 or :SiHR, as the activation energy of this process (~210kJ/mol) is much less than the Si–Si and Si–H bond energies. While pure silanes do not react with pure water or dilute acids, traces of alkali catalyse immediate hydrolysis to hydrated silicon dioxide. If the reaction is carried out in methanol, controlled solvolysis results in the products SiH2(OMe)2, SiH(OMe)3, and Si(OMe)4. The Si–H bond also adds to alkenes, a reaction which proceeds slowly and speeds up with increasing substitution of the silane involved. At 450°C, silane participates in an <b>addition</b> <b>reaction</b> with acetone, as well as a ring-opening reaction with ethylene oxide. Direct reaction of the silanes with chlorine or bromine results in explosions at room temperature, but the reaction of silane with bromine at −80°C is controlled and yields bromosilane and dibromosilane.
