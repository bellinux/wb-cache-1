50|$|In {{industrial}} process control, an annunciator panel {{is a system}} to alert operators of alarm conditions in the plant. Multiple back-lit windows are provided, each engraved {{with the name of}} a process alarm. Lamps in each window are controlled by hard-wired switches in the plant, arranged to operate when a process condition enters an abnormal state (such as high temperature, low pressure, loss of cooling water flow, or many others). Single point or multipoint <b>alarm</b> <b>logic</b> modules operate the window lights based on a preselected ISA 18.1 or custom sequence.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a compact Radar for real-time detection of targets in smart mobility applications. The Radar integrates Fabry–Perot resonating antennas, X-band and configurable continuous wave transceiver, high-speed analog-digital-converter and low-power/low-cost FPGA for the baseband signal processing. The latter includes region-of-interest selection, 2 D Fast Fourier Transform for range-Doppler map extraction, peak detection and <b>alarm</b> decision <b>logic.</b> The transmitted power can be configured from few mW to 1. 8 W. This allows for a trade-off between the maximum detection range, from few hundreds of meters up to 1. 54 km, and the Radar power consumption, from 2. 56 W to 11. 66 W. The measured speed is up to 40 m/s. The speed and distance resolutions are 0. 3 m/s and 37. 5 cm, respectively. The configurable Radar features increased robustness vs. laser-scanners, video cameras, or induction loops detection techniques, and stands for its better trade-off in terms of covered range, size, and low-power consumption vs. state-of-the-art surveillance Radars...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} test of a compact multi-channel platform for acquisition and real-time processing of Radar sensor signals. The sensing system includes a multi-channel X-band transceiver, implementing a linear frequency-modulated continuous wave scheme, plus an FPGA processor implementing sensor signal processing chain. The latter includes ROI (Region of Interest Selection), 3 D FFT, peak detection, <b>alarm</b> decision <b>logic,</b> data calibration and diagnostic. The FPGA also manages data communication with external hosts. The Radar sensing system allows detecting moving and still targets with covered range of 300 m and a resolution better than 40 cm. The sensor is suited for operations in urban scenarios like surveillance of railroad crossing and road crossing, monitoring of cars parking, with increased robustness vs. LIDAR, camera or ultrasounds techniques. The sensor has a low power consumption and low weight, and hence can be mounted on-board vehicles such as cars or UAVs for aerial surveillance of smart cities...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to study of interactions of utra-high energy cosmic rays using measured data from the Pierre Auger Observatory, automatic alarm system called Shift Guard and analysis of correlation of temperature and detector response. The Pierre Auger Observatory is the largest experiment to study ultra-high energy cosmic rays. The assumed relation between temperature and fluorescence detector response is studied together with descriptive temperature analysis, which shows that the air-conditioning system {{is not able to}} stabilize temperature enough. The temperature influence on camera response is investigated in order to measure the calibration correction factor. Shift Guard - the alarm system dedicated to protect fluorescence detectors and data taking is introduced and its functionality is described. The alarm system informs shifters about some events and situations that can endanger detector or deteriorate data quality. The basic parameters and <b>alarm</b> system <b>logic</b> are described together with light and sound signals. The discrepancy between measured and predicted number of muons at ground level calculated by EAS generators is showed and possible sources of this disagree- ment are studied. The result of massive dark photons decay in EAS as one of exotic muon source is presented. The analysis [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{protection}} of the Windings of RFX against fast electric faults relies on an original dedicated Fast Protection System able to operate within 1 ms. The first ring of the protection chain is the fault protection system of the winding, named RGM, that consists of: about hundred highly reliable voltage and current probes, all electric signal lines and an analog-digital device where signals are processed and <b>logic</b> <b>alarms</b> are generated. RGM is an original machine that required a careful design and manufacturing work. After a long test and adjustment phase it now operates properly. It has already operated against some earth faults which, due to low level of earth current, were not dangerous for the machine but very hard to detect...|$|R
40|$|In the LHC beam {{pipes and}} cryostats, the {{pressure}} measurement covers a wide range, from 1500 mbar down to 10 ⁻¹¹ mbar and even lower. If vacuum deteriorates, alarm signals are generated {{and sent to}} other systems, e. g. cryogenics, accelerating cavities, kicker magnets, and beam interlock. In addition, an unacceptable pressure rise in beam pipes generates interlocks to close the adjacent sector valves, thus isolating the sector, so that the pressure rise does not propagate. This paper describes the measurement chains, the <b>alarms</b> and interlocks <b>logic</b> used in the vacuum control system of the LHC. We analyze the possible signal degradation caused by ionizing radiation or due to cable length, shielding and grounding. The weaknesses of the existing vacuum measurement system are pointed out, and a prospective for improvement of the conditioning electronics is proposed. During the first LHC long shut down, several corrections were applied; {{the results of the}} tests after commissioning are also presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{test of a}} Radar sensor signal {{acquisition}} and processing platform {{is presented in the}} paper. The Radar sensor operates in real-time and is suited for surveillance applications in transport systems. It includes a front-end with a continuous-wave frequency-modulated transceiver operating in X-band, with a single transmitter and multiple receivers, and a multi-channel high-speed A/D converter. Sensor signal processing and data communication tasks with external hosts are managed by an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). The signal processing chain includes region of interest selection, multi-dimensional FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), peak detection, <b>alarm</b> decision <b>logic,</b> data calibration and diagnostic. By configuring the Radar sensing platform in low-power mode (7 dBm transmitted power) it is possible to detect still and moving targets with a covered range up to 300 m and 30 cm resolution. The measuring range can be increased up to 2 km by adding an extra 34. 5 dBm power amplifier. The Radar sensing platform can be configured for a maximum detected speed of 200 km/h, with a resolution of 1. 56 km/h, or a speed up to 50 km/h with a resolution of 0. 4 km/h. The cross-range resolution depends on the number of receiving channels; a trade-off can be found between cross-range resolution of the Radar sensor and its complexity and power consumption. With respect to the state-of-the-art of surveillance Radar sensors and Lidars, the proposed solution stands for its high configurability, and for the better trade-off that can be found in terms of covered distance and power consumptio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, installation {{and implementation of}} an integrated energy information system at the central plant, auxiliary utility plants, and selected buildings at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The Comprehensive Integrated Metering and Monitoring System (CIMMS) at the University of New Mexico collects electricity, natural gas, chilled water and steam energy consumption and production data. The CIMMS project was implemented to develop baseline energy consumption measurements and provide the ability to evaluate and improve energy system performance through data analysis and control systems. Prior to implementation of CIMMS, the campus had only two main electric meters and no way to collect detailed steam, chilled water or natural gas consumption data. CIMMS was implemented by Square D in association with New Horizon Technologies and the Energy Systems Laboratory at Texas A&M University. As installed, CIMMS included 28 Square D Power Logic Circuit Monitors with on-board data logging, true RMS metering, ANSI C 12. 16 revenue accuracy, sag/swell and harmonic power quality analysis and field installable modules for Ethernet, on-board <b>alarming</b> and programmable <b>logic.</b> The system also included six Power Logic Power Meters and System Manager Software (SMS). Another key element of CIMMS is the integration of mechanical metering. Twenty Modicon Momentum Programmable Logic Controllers were networked with the Circuit monitors and collect more than 120 thermal energy data points from utility natural gas meters and campus natural gas, steam and chilled water sub-meters. Square D's SMS is the primary communication and data collection software that is used for integrating MODBUS devices, uploading onboard logs, storing historical data logs and pictorially displaying real-time data. EnerTel? software, developed by eComponents Technology, Inc., overlays the SMS database to create historical data views, load profiles, utility cost estimates and custom reports. The CIMMS software generates numerous automated custom reports including a campus energy balance with electricity, steam and chilled water subsystems, steam and chilled water production and consumption reports and individual facility or building energy production and consumption reports. This paper {{will focus on the}} design, installation and implementation challenges associated with a large, state-of-the-art energy information system. Key aspects of CIMMS that will be highlighted in this paper include the following: ?Turn-key project ownership ?Proven technology (Commercial, Off-the-Shelf) ?Industry standard, open system network protocols ?Reliance on the existing campus Ethernet TCP/IP backbone fiber optic network ?Requirement of 48 hours of on-board data-logging capability at the device level to provide security from network disruption ?Integration of legacy electronic Watt metering equipment into CIMMS ?Extensive data analysis and reporting software requirements ?Capability for integration with future building automation system (BAS) ...|$|R
