40|$|Hand tremor {{measurement}} {{was evaluated}} {{in a group}} of 54 male workers (mean age 38. 5 years) exposed to mercury vapor (average duration of exposure 7. 7 years) using an <b>accelerometer</b> <b>test</b> and two psychomotor tests (eye-hand coordination and hand steadiness). The results were compared with those obtained in a well-matched control group of 48 workers. The intensity of current mercury vapor exposure was rather moderate as reflected by the mean (geometric) levels of mercury in blood (2. 4 micrograms/dl) and in urine (63 micrograms/g creatinine). The hand steadiness test and eye-hand coordination test revealed preclinical alterations in postural and intentional tremor, whereas the changes evidenced by the <b>accelerometer</b> <b>test</b> were not statistically significant. Furthermore the practical advantage of the psychomotor <b>tests</b> over the <b>accelerometer</b> <b>test</b> makes them most appropriate for the early detection of mercury-induced hand tremor. The present study also suggests that young adults (less than 21 years) may be more susceptible to the neurotoxic effect of mercury vapor...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a new genetic {{evaluation}} model to estimate the genetic merit of boars for growth based on 1) performance of their crossbred progeny fattened in the <b>test</b> <b>station</b> and 2) their own performance or those of relatives from the on-farm testing system. The model was a bivariate random regression animal model with linear splines and was applied to Piétrain boars from the Walloon Region of Belgium mated with Landrace sows. Data contained 1) 12, 610 BW records from the <b>test</b> <b>station</b> collected on 1, 435 crossbred pigs from Piétrain boars and Landrace sows, and 2) 52, 993 BW records from the on-farm testing system collected on 50, 670 pigs with a breed composition of at least 40 % Piétrain or Landrace. Since 2007, 56 Piétrain boars have been <b>tested</b> in the <b>station.</b> Data used to estimate variance components and breeding values were standardized for the age to take into account heterogeneity of variances and then pre-adjusted at 210 d of age to put all records on the same scale. Body weight records from the <b>test</b> <b>station</b> and from the on-farm testing system were considered as 2 different traits. The heterosis effect was modeled as fixed regression on the heterozygosity coefficient. As all <b>test</b> <b>station</b> animals were similarly crossbred, smaller variation in heterozygosity caused the sampling error of the regression estimate at 210 d to be larger in the <b>test</b> <b>station</b> than in on-farm data with estimates of 28. 35 ± 14. 55 kg and 9. 02 ± 0. 67 kg, respectively. Therefore, the most likely reason for the large differences in estimates was sampling. Heritability estimates ranged from 0. 37 to 0. 60 at 210 and 75 d, respectively, for <b>test</b> <b>station</b> BW and from 0. 42 to 0. 60 at 210 d and 175 d, respectively, for on-farm BW. Genetic correlation decreased when the age interval between records increased, and were greater between ages for <b>test</b> <b>station</b> than for on-farm data. Genetic correlations between <b>test</b> <b>station</b> and on-farm BW at the same age were high: 0. 90 at 175 d and 0. 85 at 210 d. For the 56 boars <b>tested</b> in the <b>station,</b> the average reliability of their EBV for ADG between 100 and 210 d was improved from 0. 60 using only <b>test</b> <b>station</b> data to 0. 69 using jointly <b>test</b> <b>station</b> and on-farm data. Based on these results, the new model developed was considered as a good method of detection of differences in growth potential of Piétrain boars based on <b>test</b> <b>station</b> and on-farm data.
