25|$|Addison’s {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{that affects the}} adrenal cortex such that it is unable to efficiently secrete hormones. The immune system specifically targets {{the cells of the}} adrenal cortex and destroys them, but Addison’s disease can also be caused by a severe infection such as tuberculosis. Some symptoms include hypoglycemia and decreased blood sodium levels and increased blood potassium levels caused by a deficiency of aldosterone. These electrolyte imbalances induce nerve and muscle issues. Other symptoms include fatigue, salt cravings, weight loss, and increased skin pigmentation. Increased skin pigmentation is caused by a deficiency of the <b>adrenocortical</b> <b>hormone</b> hydrocortisone. Its normal behavior would be as negative feedback at the pituitary gland, stimulating the pituitary gland to decrease secretion of corticotropin. Because hydrocortisone is not able to be produced in Addison’s disease, the pituitary gland continues to secrete corticotropin which binds to the receptor for melanocyte-stimulating hormone. It then causes melanocytes to produce more pigment, thus darkening the skin tone.|$|E

Memory can also be selectively enhanced by post-training administration of drugs and hormones. It is also well known that emotional situations produce an [...] "adrenaline rush". This adrenaline, as well as cortisol (<b>adrenocortical</b> <b>hormone)</b> serve to influence an organism's response to stress, but also may aid future responding by enhancing declarative memory of them.|$|E

Carleton MacDowell in 1928 discovered a strain of mouse called C58 that developed spontaneous leukemia - an early mouse model of cancer.

25|$|In {{humans and}} other animals, the <b>adrenocortical</b> <b>hormones</b> are hormones {{produced}} by the adrenal cortex, the outer region of the adrenal gland. These polycyclic steroid hormones {{have a variety of}} roles that are crucial for the body’s response to stress (for example, the fight-or-flight response), and they also regulate other functions in the body. Threats to homeostasis, such as injury, chemical imbalances, infection, or psychological stress, can initiate a stress response. Examples of <b>adrenocortical</b> <b>hormones</b> that are involved in the stress response are aldosterone and cortisol. These hormones also function in regulating the conservation of water by the kidneys and glucose metabolism, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Addison's disease, {{sometimes}} called bronze skin disease, is the progressive {{destruction of the}} adrenal glands with the result being deficiency of secretion of <b>adrenocortical</b> <b>hormones.</b> Addison described this condition in his 1855 publication: On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsules.|$|R
50|$|Theories {{behind the}} disease include stress-driven hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{dysfunction}} and <b>adrenocortical</b> <b>hormone</b> (endocrine) abnormalities, neurogenic inflammation, and myofascial pain syndrome. In {{the latter two}} categories, dysregulation of the local nervous system due to past trauma, infection or an anxious disposition and chronic albeit unconscious pelvic tensing lead to inflammation that is mediated by substances released by nerve cells (such as substance P). The prostate (and {{other areas of the}} genitourinary tract: bladder, urethra, testicles) can become inflamed by the action of the chronically activated pelvic nerves on the mast cells {{at the end of the}} nerve pathways. Similar stress-induced genitourinary inflammation has been shown experimentally in other mammals. However, there is no correlation between inflammation on histological examination of the prostate and the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that acute injury re-sults in {{an outpouring of}} <b>adrenocortical</b> <b>hormones</b> 5 (1, 2), and that these hormones {{play an important role}} in the response of the total organism to such injury. The marked increase in urinary nitrogen excretion which characteristically occurs immedi-ately following acute injury is usually considered to result from the catabolic action of the adreno-cortical hormones on protein metabolism (3). Supporting this concept are recent studies corre-lating the negative nitrogen balance following surgical trauma in man with the rise in 17 -hy-droxysteroid excretion (4). The participation of the thyroid gland in the response to acute injury in man is less well deline-ated. Certain observations have suggested that there may be an increase in circulating thyroid hormone in man following trauma (5, 6); other in-vestigators have been unable to confirm this finding (7, 8). The role of the thyroid is particularly difficult to evaluate following injury because the increased output of <b>adrenocortical</b> <b>hormones</b> may affect some of the methods used to assay thyroid function (9 - 11), and may also tend to inhibit thyroid activity (9, 11 - 14). Goldenberg, Lutwak, Rosenbaum, and Hayes (15) have recently proposed that the catabolic response to injury is due primarily to excess thy-roid <b>hormone</b> rather than <b>adrenocortical</b> <b>hormones...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} maternal <b>adrenocortical</b> <b>hormones</b> {{on the development of}} fetal pancreatic islet cells, pregnant rats were adrenalectomised on d 6 of gestation. On d 12 – 16 the growth patterns of fetal insulin-producing B cells, glucagon-producing A cells, and somatostatin-producing D cells were observed histometrically. Maternal adrenalectomy resulted in growth retardation of fetal B cells on d 12 – 15. Maternal corticosterone therapy prevented this retardation. Maternal adrenalectomy, however, did not affect the developmental patterns of A and D cells. By Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, glucocorticoid receptors were demonstrated to be present in the islet cells from d 12 to d 15. These results suggest that maternal <b>adrenocortical</b> <b>hormones,</b> glucocorticoids in particular, maintain the early development of fetal pancreatic B cells through their specific intracellular glucocorticoid receptor...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether annual changes in physiology occur in individually housed squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus). Physiological measures were monitored for 20 months. Over {{the course of}} the study, all individually housed males and females exhibited clear annual changes in gonadal and adrenal hormone levels, and males exhibited species-typical changes in body weight. Females exhibited a typical pattern of hormonal changes, with elevations in gonadal steroids occurring during the same months as elevations in cortisol. Males, however, exhibited an atypical pattern, as elevations in hormone levels were not synchronized with each other; rather, elevations in testosterone occurred out of phase with changes in cortisol and body weight. The timing of annual events in individually housed subjects was compared to that in nearby social groups, in which the timing of the breeding season from year to year was determined by social group formations and was outside the naturally occurring breeding season.

25|$|<b>Adrenocortical</b> <b>hormones</b> {{are divided}} into three classes by function: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Mineralocorticoid hormones are {{synthesized}} in the outermost layer of the adrenal cortex known as the zona glomerulosa. Their function is to regulate the concentration of electrolytes circulating in the blood. For example, aldosterone functions to raise blood sodium levels and lower blood potassium levels by targeting the kidneys. Specifically, it binds receptors of cells that comprise the distal tubules of the kidneys which then stimulate ion channels to conserve sodium and excrete potassium. Additionally, the ion gradient initiates conservation of water.|$|R

It was synthesized in 1940. The steroid has profound effects on carbohydrate metabolism and possesses activities associated with adrenal cortex hormones like cortisone. However, it is non-toxic even in high dosages, suggesting that it lacks conventional glucocorticoid activity, and it does not possess mineralocorticoid activity, unlike other <b>adrenocortical</b> <b>hormones.</b> 11-Ketoprogesterone may act through membrane glucocorticoid receptors.|$|R
