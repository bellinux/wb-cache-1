5|$|Developments in AspectJ have {{revealed}} {{the potential to}} incorporate just-in-time compilation into the execution of aspect-oriented code to address performance demands. At run-time, an aspect weaver could translate aspects in a more efficient manner than traditional, static weaving approaches. Using AspectJ on a Java Virtual Machine, dynamic weaving of aspects at run-time {{has been shown to}} improve code performance by 26%. While some implementations of just-in-time virtual machines implement this capability through a new virtual machine, some implementations can be designed to use features that <b>already</b> <b>exist</b> in current virtual machines. The requirement of a new virtual machine is contrary to one of the original design goals of AspectJ.|$|E
5|$|Phases 3 and 4 {{will extend}} the line south from 63rd Street to Houston Street and Hanover Square, respectively. As part of Phase 3, a {{connection}} to the IND 63rd Street Line would be built, allowing for non-revenue moves into Queens. This connection will be constructed through underground drilling and blasting. Bellmouths <b>already</b> <b>exist</b> for this connection east of the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station. This section, {{like the rest of the}} line, will mainly consist of a two-track line. However, between 21st Street and 9th Street, two additional tracks will be constructed on either side of the main alignment to allow for the storage of eight trains. This location was selected due to the sufficient depth of the area.|$|E
5|$|Day and Greene sounded out {{scientists}} and science communicators about their idea, enlisting {{many of their}} contacts as the festival's scientific advisors. They met with {{the presidents of the}} city's major universities and its cultural and scientific institutions, forging partnerships for the festival's organization. According to Greene, their idea fell on open ears wherever they went, and the most frequent reaction to their proposal was the expression of disbelief that a festival like this did not <b>already</b> <b>exist</b> in New York City. Early 2006 saw the founding of the Science Festival Foundation (SFF), a non-profit organization based in New York City, dedicated to organizing the festival and related events. Greene serves as the foundation's chairman, and is also on its board of directors. The other members of the board are Alan Alda, Columbia University president Lee Bollinger, the foundation's president Judith Cox, New York University president John Sexton, and Tracy Day, who also serves as the festival's executive director.|$|E

25|$|A {{fundamental}} {{problem in the}} design of decompression tables is that the simplified rules that govern a single dive and ascent do not apply when some tissue bubbles <b>already</b> <b>exist,</b> as these will delay inert gas elimination and equivalent decompression may result in decompression sickness. Repetitive diving, multiple ascents within a single dive, and surface decompression procedures are significant risk factors for DCS. These have been attributed {{to the development of a}} relatively high gas phase volume which may be partly carried over to subsequent dives or the final ascent of a sawtooth profile.|$|E

25|$|Since R. revolutionalis queens mate singly, {{there is}} a high level of {{relatedness}} within the colony, and the workers are more likely to favor the sons produced by workers rather than sons produced by the queen because the workers are more closely related to each other's sons. This can create potential conflict. However, when there are multiple queens in a colony, the level of relatedness decreases, and the workers are more likely to favor the queen’s sons. So, the workers switch between wanting to invest in new queens and wanting to invest in males depending on how many queens <b>already</b> <b>exist</b> in the colony.|$|E

25|$|Despite its {{reliance}} on manufacturing, Indiana has been less affected by declines in traditional Rust Belt manufactures than many of its neighbors. The explanation appears to be certain factors in the labor market. First, much of the heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires highly skilled labor, and firms are often willing to locate where hard-to-train skills <b>already</b> <b>exist.</b> Second, Indiana's labor force is located primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises. This {{makes it possible for}} firms to offer somewhat lower wages for these skills than would normally be paid. Firms often see in Indiana a chance to obtain higher than average skills at lower than average wages.|$|E
25|$|Some {{standard}} {{but rarely}} used options <b>already</b> <b>exist</b> in JPEG {{to improve the}} efficiency of coding DCT coefficients: the arithmetic coding option, and the progressive coding option (which produces lower bitrates because values for each coefficient are coded independently, and each coefficient has a significantly different distribution). Modern methods have improved on these techniques by reordering coefficients to group coefficients of larger magnitude together; using adjacent coefficients and blocks to predict new coefficient values; dividing blocks or coefficients up among {{a small number of}} independently coded models based on their statistics and adjacent values; and most recently, by decoding blocks, predicting subsequent blocks in the spatial domain, and then encoding these to generate predictions for DCT coefficients.|$|E
25|$|Symmetric-key cryptosystems use {{the same}} key for {{encryption}} and decryption of a message, though a message or group of messages may have a different key than others. A significant disadvantage of symmetric ciphers is the key management necessary to use them securely. Each distinct pair of communicating parties must, ideally, share a different key, and perhaps each ciphertext exchanged as well. The number of keys required increases as {{the square of the}} number of network members, which very quickly requires complex key management schemes to keep them all consistent and secret. The difficulty of securely establishing a secret key between two communicating parties, when a secure channel does not <b>already</b> <b>exist</b> between them, also presents a chicken-and-egg problem which is a considerable practical obstacle for cryptography users in the real world.|$|E
