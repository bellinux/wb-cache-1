40|$|A key {{unanswered}} {{question that}} must be addressed before polymeric composites will be widely used in automotive structural components is their known durability. Major durability issues are the effects that cyclic loadings, creep, <b>automotive</b> <b>fluid</b> environments, and low-energy impacts have on dimensional stability, strength, and stiffness throughout the required life of a composite component. This report reviews the current state of understanding in each of these areas. It also discusses the limited information that exists on one of the prime candidate materials for automotive structural applications [...] an isocyanurate reinforced with a continuous strand, swirl mat. Because of the key role that nondestructive evaluations must play in understanding damage development and progression, a chapter is included on ultrasonic techniques. A final chapter then gives conclusions and recommendations for research needed to resolve the various durability issues. These recommendations will help provide a sound basis for program planning for the Durability of Lightweight Composite Structures Project sponsored by the US Department of Energy in cooperation with the Automotive Composites Consortium of Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors...|$|R
40|$|Before {{composite}} structures can be {{widely used in}} automotive applications, their long-term durability must be assured. The Durability of Lightweight Composite Structures Project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory was established by the US Department of Energy to help provide that assurance. The project is closely coordinated with the Automotive Composites Consortium. The experimentally-based, durability-driven design criteria described in this paper {{are the result of}} the initial project thrust. The criteria address a single reference composite, which is an SRIM (Structural Reaction Injection Molded) polyurethane, reinforced with continuous strand, swirl-mat E-glass fibers. The durability issues addressed include the effects of cyclic and sustained loadings, temperature, <b>automotive</b> <b>fluid</b> environments, and low-energy impacts (e. g., tool drops and roadway kickups) on strength, stiffness, and deformation. The criteria provide design analysis guidance, a multiaxial strength criterion, time-independent and time-dependent allowable stresses, rules for cyclic loading, and damage tolerance design guidance. Environmental degradation factors and the degrading effects of prior loadings are included. Efforts are currently underway to validate the criteria by application to a second random-glass-fiber composite. Carbon-fiber composites are also being addressed...|$|R
40|$|Thermosets show {{excellent}} {{mechanical properties}} and chemical resistance (for most <b>automotive</b> <b>fluids)</b> even at high temperatures up to 300 °C. Furthermore {{they can be}} highly efficient processed by injection molding. So they should be particularly suited for e. g. under the bonnet applications. However, the reality shows that thermosets are, except fiber reinforced composites, heavily underrepresented in technical applications. E. g. thermosetting components only account 0, 2 % to a vehicle’s weight. Therefore reasons {{can be found in}} limited knowledge, e. g. relating mold filling behavior. The objective of the study is to analyze the influence of the mold filling behavior during injection molding of highly filled phenolic compounds on mechanical properties. Injection molding filling studies, mechanical testing and optical microscopy were done while varying mold geometry (injection gate and cavity height), mold temperature and injection rate during injection molding a highly filled phenolic compound. It was found that the mold filling behavior varies with altered injection molding parameters as well as the mold geometry. In consequence of this the mechanical properties change according to the resulting reinforcement orientation. The results can help to improve part and mold design for optimal load transmission...|$|E
40|$|In {{automotive}} under-the-hood applications, electronics respectively their {{packaging materials}} {{come in contact}} with <b>automotive</b> <b>fluids.</b> The effect of automatic transmission fluid (ATF) on an anhydride-cured epoxy was investigated at temperatures up to 180 8 C for up to 1000 h. This study has shown that ATF retards the oxidative aging of the epoxy, presumably due to oxygen consumption. Where as in air the material underwent a thermo-oxidative aging with a mass loss of up to 4 % and a strong broadening of Tg to higher temperatures, in ATF a temperature dependent distinctive drop of Tg from 142 8 C to 126 8 C after 1000 h aging at 180 8 C, and a mass loss of maximum 1 % was observed which might be a thermal decomposition of the epoxy material. A slight broadening of the damping factors might indicate an intrusion of ATF components. A color change of the samples could be observed after aging in air and ATF, with the discoloration in air being more intense. An explanation for the color change might be either a minor amount of oxygen causing an oxidative discoloration reaction or the intrusion of colored ATF degradation products. While the oxidation-kinetics in air exhibited Arrhenius temperature-dependence the mechanism in ATF changed above 165 8 C. An acceleration of aging tests at temperatures beyond 150 8 C is therefore not possible...|$|E

40|$|Multilayer {{automotive}} fuel lines {{are currently being}} developed in response to stricter environmental legislation governing evaporative emissions. These fuel lines generally have different polymers, an Quter layer (pA 12), a high barrier inner layer (pVdF, THY or PBT) and an adhesive tie layer (modified PA 12) to bond together the outer and inner layers. A range of fuel line polymers were injection moulded and samples immersed in a conventional unleaded fuel, a standard test fuel and fuel components methanol, ethanol and toluene at 20 Ã‚Â°C. Weight gain, swelling and mechanical property analysis showed minimal change for the fluoropolymers but the tie layer resins exhibited gross swelling and significant reduction in mechanical properties. DMTA analysis showed that {{this was due to}} the plasticizing effect ofthe various fluids in the polymer matrices. Elevated temperature immersion studies on nylon 12, PVdF and PBT resins indicated that much higher diffusion coefficients were recorded for the nylon 12 resin, particularly at 600 C. The results also showed that the PVdF exhibited the best barrier performance to these fluids, even at 600 C. A range of multilayer tubes were manufactured at the University and the barrier performance ofthese tubes were determined using an EMS P-tester, the results confirmed that multilayer tubes with a PVdF inner layer exhibited low permeation values. An FTIR-ATR technique was developed to reduce the time tak. ~n to measure the. diffusion of fuel components through polymer films. The results demonstrated that the diffusion coefficients measured using the FTIR-ATR technique correlated well with results obtained using the gravimetric method.

40|$|Tuning cables {{of various}} designs are {{commonly}} included in automotive power steering systems {{to reduce the}} undesirable effects of pressure pulsations generated in the power steering pump. A recent development which {{has the potential to}} reduce noise is the plastic tuner (PT). The main benefit of this device when compared with the existing spiral wound steel tuner (SWST) is the vastly reduced cost associated with the methods of manufacturing. Despite the apparent attractiveness of such a device, the PT has not been widely implemented by <b>automotive</b> <b>fluid</b> system suppliers. The main reason is relatively {{little is known about the}} performance of these devices and indeed their comparative performance with respect to a SWST. This research seeks to address this issue by developing a better understanding of the PT using experimental and analytical techniques to examine the acoustic noise reduction mechanisms of a variety of PT designs. This thesis examines the relevant literature associated with the subject and covers several noise reduction techniques that can be applied to this research. The literature review section highlights a general gap in the knowledge base, where little specific detail exists that has not been derived experimentally from SWSTs. As such the general aim of this research is to further the knowledge into PTs, investigate the significant parameters of PT designs, and generate a suitable system model. The methodology proposed to achieve these aims is explained in detail and experimental and theoretical approaches are outlined. Finally, conclusions derived from the experimental investigations are discussed and a comparison is drawn between experimental and predicted results. For all PT parameters evaluated, good agreement is illustrated between predicted and experimental results. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Mechanical Engineering, 201...|$|R
