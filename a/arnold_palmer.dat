25|$|<b>Arnold</b> Daniel <b>Palmer</b> (September 10, 1929– September 25, 2016) was an American {{professional}} golfer who {{is generally}} {{regarded as one of}} the greatest and most charismatic players in the sport's history. Dating back to 1955, he won numerous events on both the PGA Tour and the circuit now known as PGA Tour Champions. Nicknamed The King, he was one of golf's most popular stars and its most important trailblazer, the first superstar of the sport's television age, which began in the 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|Latrobe Country Club {{was founded}} in 1920 {{by a group of}} leading industrialists, bankers and {{professionals}} from Latrobe, Pennsylvania. The group had acquired 63 acre of the Kennan Farm bordering on what was then the National Lincoln Highway (U.S. Route 30) just west of Youngstown. By the summer of 1921, work was well underway on the golf course and clubhouse.

5|$|The tournament has {{a number}} of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, {{although}} it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot {{on the morning of the}} first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, <b>Arnold</b> <b>Palmer,</b> Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.|$|E

50|$|Arnold {{married the}} former Gale Hussman of Camden in 1958, but the {{marriage}} {{ended in divorce}} in 1975. Gale's father was the Arkansas publisher and mass media mogul Walter E.

Arnold had two daughters by Gale: Janet Sheppard Arnold Hart of San Carlos, California, and Lydia <b>Palmer</b> <b>Arnold</b> of Syracuse, New York. Both daughters {{went on to become}} lawyers. Ms. Arnold formerly was an adjunct professor at Syracuse University College of Law.

60|$|Edward {{called for}} him in a rickety trap drawn by an old mare, and they drove along a road that ran by the sea. On each side of it were plantations, coconut and vanilla; and now and then they saw a great mango, its fruit yellow and red and purple among the massy green of the leaves; now and then they had {{a glimpse of the}} lagoon, smooth and blue, with here and there a tiny islet graceful with tall <b>palms.</b> <b>Arnold</b> Jackson's house stood on a little hill and only a path led to it, so they unharnessed the mare and tied her to a tree, leaving the trap {{by the side of the}} road. To Bateman it seemed a happy-go-lucky way of doing things. But when they went up to the house they were met by a tall, {{handsome}} native woman, no longer young, with whom Edward cordially shook hands. He introduced Bateman to her.|$|R
5|$|Woods {{began his}} 2012 season with two tournaments (the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship and the AT Pebble Beach National Pro-Am) {{where he started}} off well, but {{struggled}} on the final rounds. Following the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, where he was knocked out {{in the second round}} by missing a 5-foot putt, Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second at the Honda Classic, with the lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career. After a short time off due to another leg injury, Woods won the <b>Arnold</b> <b>Palmer</b> Invitational, his first win on the PGA Tour since the BMW Championship in September 2009. Following several dismal performances, Woods notched his 73rd PGA Tour win at the Memorial Tournament in June, tying Jack Nicklaus in second place for most PGA Tour victories; a month later, Woods surpassed Nicklaus with a win at the AT National, to trail only Sam Snead, who accumulated 82 PGA tour wins.|$|E
5|$|Woods took a hiatus from {{professional}} golf from December 2009 to early April 2010 {{in order to}} focus on difficult issues in his personal life. He and his estranged wife Elin eventually divorced. His many alleged extramarital indiscretions were revealed by several women, through many worldwide media sources. This {{was followed by a}} loss of golf form, and his ranking gradually fell to a low of No. 58 in November 2011. He ended a career-high winless streak of 107 weeks when he triumphed in the Chevron World Challenge in December 2011. After winning the <b>Arnold</b> <b>Palmer</b> Invitational on March 25, 2013, he ascended to the No.1 ranking once again, holding the top spot until May 2014. Woods had back surgery in April 2014 and September 2015 and has struggled since to regain his dominant form. By March 29, 2015, Woods had fallen to #104, outside of the top 100 {{for the first time since}} 1996. In May 2016, Woods dropped out of the world top 500 for the first time in his professional career. In July 2017, the Official World Golf Ranking placed Woods at number 1,005, the worst of his career and only time he has ever been out of the top 1,000. He had ranked number one for a total of 683 weeks, more than any other player in history.|$|E
