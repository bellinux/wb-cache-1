5|$|In 1951, {{his novel}} The Catcher in the Rye was an {{immediate}} popular success. His depiction of adolescent <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> loss of innocence in the protagonist Holden Caulfield was influential, especially among adolescent readers. The novel remains widely read and controversial, selling around 250,000 copies a year.|$|E
5|$|Several of Schubert's last songs (the Schwanengesang collection), {{composed}} {{during the}} period of the sketching of the last sonatas, also portray a deep sense of <b>alienation,</b> <b>and</b> bear important similarities with specific moments in the sonatas. These include the songs Der Atlas (recalls the opening of the C minor Sonata), Ihr Bild (the B-flat major/G-flat major conflict {{at the opening of the}} B-flat Sonata), Am Meer, and Der Doppelgänger.|$|E
5|$|Within {{his first}} three films, Hard Eight, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, Anderson {{explored}} themes of dysfunctional families, <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness. Boogie Nights and Magnolia were noted for their large ensemble casts, which Anderson returned to in Inherent Vice. In Punch-Drunk Love, Anderson explored similar themes but expressed a different visual style, shedding the influences and references of his earlier films, being more surreal and having {{a heightened sense of}} reality. It was also short, compared to his previous two films, at 90 minutes.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} scene Harris and Klebold are {{standing}} outside their high school. The player guides {{them to the}} cafeteria to plant their timed propane bombs without being detected by security cameras or hall monitors. After the explosives are set, the two stop {{for a moment on}} a hill outside the school, discussing their <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> hostility. After the bombs fail to explode as planned, Harris and Klebold decide to enter the school and murder as many people as they can; the final number killed is up to the player. After roaming around the school shooting innocents, Harris and Klebold commit suicide. A montage of clips showing Harris and Klebold's corpses, students comforting each other, and childhood photos of the gunmen plays.|$|E
5|$|Megadeth's lyrics often {{focus on}} death, war, politics, and religion. The lyricism centers on nihilistic themes, but {{occasionally}} deals with {{topics such as}} <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> social problems. The earliest releases featured themes such as occultism, graphic violence, and Satanism. Nuclear warfare and government conspiracy were preoccupations on albums such as Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction. During Megadeth's commercial peak, Mustaine elaborated on more personal themes such as addiction and intimate relationships. For the lyrics on Cryptic Writings, Mustaine said {{that he wanted to}} write songs that had more appeal to a wider audience. The title of United Abominations is a satiric play on the name of the United Nations; Mustaine criticized the organization's ineffectiveness on a number of songs on that album. Later albums contained lyrics in a similar vein.|$|E
5|$|According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, {{the themes}} of <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> persecution, {{although}} present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading the Kafka work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour {{may have been an}} inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.|$|E

25|$|Responding to the {{intensification}} of <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> irrationality in an advanced capitalist society, critical theory is a comprehensive, ideology-critical, historically self-reflective body of theory aiming simultaneously to explain domination and point to the possibilities of bringing about a rational, humane, and free society. Frankfurt School critical theorists developed numerous theories of the economic, political, cultural, and psychological domination structures of advanced industrial civilization.|$|E

25|$|Such {{events were}} now officially sanctioned {{and no longer}} {{discouraged}} by their managements. No police raids at these establishments took place. With these weekly gatherings for energetic dancing to let off steam and meet new friends, homosexuals felt the first bonds of a relatively cohesive community- a warm feeling of being welcomed into a new brotherhood, in contradistinction to erstwhile isolation, <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness for many.|$|E
25|$|Twilight {{received}} lukewarm reviews. Some {{praised the}} novel's tone and its portrayal of common teenage emotions such as <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> rebellion. Others criticized Meyer's prose and argued {{the story was}} lacking in character development. It reached number five on the New York Times bestseller list within a month of its release and eventually reached first place. The novel was named one of Publishers Weeklys Best Children's Books of 2005.|$|E
25|$|This {{research}} perspective {{deals with}} relationships between large-scale social systems and individual behaviors and mental states including feelings, attitudes and values, and mental faculties. Some researchers focus {{on issues of}} health and how social networks bring useful social support to the ill. Another line of research deals with how education, occupation, and other components of social class impact values. Some studies assess emotional variations, especially in happiness versus <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> anger, among individuals in different structural positions.|$|E

5000|$|King was an Englishman, {{a native}} of Huntingdonshire. His {{predecessor}} as bishop of Elphin, John Lynch, greatly impoverished the see by alienating properties and in 1611 resigned, declaring himself a Roman Catholic. During {{more than a quarter}} of a century as bishop, King was able to recover Lynch's <b>alienations</b> <b>and</b> much improved the revenue of the diocese. Dod's Peerage of 1848 says of him that [...] "...his bishopric, which he found the poorest, he left one of the richest in all Ireland".|$|R
25|$|In 1935, Mussolini invaded Ethiopia, {{resulting}} in an international <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> leading to Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations; Italy allied with Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan and strongly supported Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war. In 1939, Italy annexed Albania, a de facto protectorate for decades. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. After initially advancing in British Somaliland and Egypt, the Italians were defeated in East Africa, the Balkans, Russia and North Africa.|$|E
25|$|Gordimer's award-winning 2002 novel, The Pickup, {{considers}} {{the issues of}} displacement, <b>alienation,</b> <b>and</b> immigration; class and economic power; religious faith; and the ability for people to see, and love, across these divides. It {{tells the story of}} a couple: Julie Summers, a white woman from a financially secure family, and Abdu, an illegal Arab immigrant in South Africa. After Abdu's visa is refused, the couple returns to his homeland, where she is the alien. Her experiences and growth as an alien in another culture form the heart of the work.|$|E
25|$|The {{withdrawal}} of drum and bass {{from the mainstream}} {{was not only a}} result of its growing fascination with its own (progressively darker) sound, but also resulted from the explosive birth and growing popularity of UK garage (2 step and 4x4 garage, aka speed garage), a musical genre heavily influenced by jungle, with similar beats, vocal and basslines but slower speeds and more friendly (or at least radio-friendly) beats. Drum and bass suddenly found itself losing popularity and established drum and bass producers expressed shock at its sudden <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> abandonment by the general public. This turn fuelled the harder sound of techstep.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish Inquisition (Inquisición Española) {{can be seen}} as {{an answer}} to the multi-religious nature of Spanish society {{following}} the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula from the Muslim Moors. After invading in 711, large areas of the Iberian Peninsula were ruled by Muslims until 1250, when they were restricted to Granada, which fell in 1492. However, the Reconquista did not result in the total expulsion of Muslims from Spain, since they, along with Jews, were tolerated by the ruling Christian elite. Large cities, especially Seville, Valladolid and Barcelona, had significant Jewish populations centered in Juderia, but in the coming years the Muslims were increasingly subjugated by <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> torture.|$|E
25|$|Most earlier Muse songs lyrically {{dealt with}} introspective themes, {{including}} relationships, social <b>alienation,</b> <b>and</b> difficulties they had encountered {{while trying to}} establish themselves in their hometown. However, with the band's progress, their song concepts have become more ambitious, addressing {{issues such as the}} fear of the evolution of technology in their Origin of Symmetry (2001) album. They deal mainly with the apocalypse in Absolution (2003) and with catastrophic war in Black Holes and Revelations (2006). The Resistance (2009) focused on themes of government oppression, uprising, love, and panspermia. The album itself was mainly inspired by Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. Their sixth studio album, The 2nd Law (2012) relates to economics, thermodynamics, and apocalyptic themes. Their latest album, Drones (2015) is a concept album that uses autonomous killing drones as a metaphor for brainwashing and loss of empathy.|$|E
25|$|Fa Zheng (176–220), {{courtesy}} name Xiaozhi, {{was a key}} {{adviser to}} the warlord Liu Bei in the late Eastern Han dynasty. Born {{in a family of}} high social status and of noble descent, Fa Zheng travelled to Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) in the late 190s and became a subordinate of Liu Zhang, the provincial governor. However, his feelings of <b>alienation</b> <b>and</b> perception of Liu Zhang as an incompetent governor eventually led him to betray Liu Zhang and defect to Liu Bei in 211. Between 211 and 214, Fa Zheng assisted Liu Bei in overcoming Liu Zhang and seizing control of Yi Province, and became one of Liu Bei's most trusted advisers. In 217, he urged Liu Bei to launch the Hanzhong Campaign to capture the strategic Hanzhong Commandery from a rival warlord, Cao Cao, but died a year after Liu emerged victorious in the campaign.|$|E
