25|$|After God created Adam, who was alone, He said, 'It is {{not good}} for man to be alone.' He then created a woman for Adam, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith {{immediately}} began to fight. She said, 'I will not lie below,' and he said, 'I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while I am to be the superior one.' Lilith responded, 'We are equal to each other inasmuch <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> both created from the earth.' But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air.|$|E

500|$|Meyer {{described}} his script as [...] "'Hornblower' in outer space", utilizing nautical references and a swashbuckling atmosphere.

Sallin was impressed with Meyer's vision for the film: [...] "His ideas brought dimension that broadened {{the scope of the}} material <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> working on it." [...] Gene Roddenberry disagreed with the script's naval texture and Khan's Captain Ahab undertones, but was mostly ignored by the creative team.|$|E

Costs for the recording sessions reached between $700,000 and $1,000,000. Wainwright admitted that he and Brion took their time recording the album in Los Angeles, and considered the extended time a [...] "blessing" [...] and [...] "luxury", claiming that [...] "most people have two weeks to record their first album". According to Wainwright, Waronker [...] "didn't care how long it took, as long <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing good work."

It was nice being able to run though scenarios with him and get his opinion on how he perceived his character.

It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and getting to write Daryl [...] which is one of my favorite characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book. It was a blast.|$|E
