5000|$|RMASG Control Tank â€” While not {{strictly}} an <b>armament</b> <b>conversion,</b> as no new ordnance was involved, Sherman V tanks {{allocated to the}} Royal Marines Armoured Support Group for the D-Day landings were fitted with a dial sight in a protruding square cover on the top right of the turret. This permitted them to be used accurately in the indirect fire role as self-propelled artillery, initially from the decks of landing craft but later also ashore. Direct fire sights were retained. These tanks can be identified in photos by the 360 degree compass bearing markings around the turret.|$|E

5000|$|In convoy with 10 other tank landing ships, LST-209 {{departed}} the Mediterranean {{through the}} Suez Canal {{and headed for}} India. After arriving at Calcutta during {{the latter part of}} November, she loaded 14 M3 [...] "General Lee" [...] tanks on 3 December and embarked 67 men of the British 14th Army before departing on 5 December, with [...] and two British motor gunboats, bound for Regu Creek, near Arakan, Burma. Although LST-208 ran aground on the run in, LST-209 beached successfully at 23:24 on 6 December. She completed unloading the tanks within 30 minutes, retracted, and reached Calcutta in the afternoon of 9 December. A week later, LST-209 received orders to proceed to the British Isles. Departing Colombo on 28 December, the ship reached the Welsh port of Milford Haven on 12 February 1944 and, after a week of operational training, was drydocked at Cardiff. She next underwent additional training, including beaching exercises on the south coast of England. After shifting thence to Rosneath, Scotland LST-209 received an <b>armament</b> <b>conversion</b> alongside destroyer tender , losing her single 3 in gun and receiving several 40 millimeter Bofors and 20 millimeter Oerlikon antiaircraft guns.|$|E

2500|$|Early in the Second World War, Shikari, {{along with}} several other S-class destroyers based in the UK, was {{modified}} as a dedicated anti-submarine escort. After <b>conversion,</b> <b>armament</b> consisted of a single 4-inch gun forward, with a 12-pounder anti-aircraft gun amidships. Close-in anti-aircraft armament consisted of two quadruple Vickers [...]50 machine gun mounts. Both sets of torpedo-tubes were removed, allowing a heavy depth charge armament, with 112 depth charges carried, with sufficient depth charge throwers and racks to allow 14-charge patterns of charges to be used. Type 286 radar and Type 133 Sonar was fitted. Later in the war, the depth charge armament was reduced, with a 10-charge pattern substituted (as this {{was found to be}} as effective as the earlier 14-charge pattern). The [...]50 machine guns were eventually replaced by four single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, and the 12 pounder anti-aircraft gun removed to allow Type 271 radar to be fitted on a lattice mast aft.|$|R
