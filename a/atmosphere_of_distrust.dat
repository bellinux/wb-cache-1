25|$|While many {{witnesses}} {{said that the}} Fanchers were in general a peaceful party whose members behaved well along the trail, rumors spread about aggressive and threatening behavior and other misdeeds. Brevet Major James Henry Carleton led the first federal investigation of the murders, published in 1859. He recorded Hamblin's account that the train was alleged to have poisoned a spring near Corn Creek; this resulted {{in the deaths of}} 18 head of cattle and two or three people who ate the contaminated meat. Carleton interviewed the father of a child who allegedly died from this poisoned spring, and accepted the sincerity of the grieving father. But, he also included a statement from an investigator who did not believe the Fancher party was capable of poisoning the spring, given its size. Carleton invited readers to consider a potential explanation for the rumors of misdeeds, noting the general <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> among Mormons for strangers at the time, and that some locals appeared jealous of the Fancher party's wealth.|$|E
25|$|After it grew {{sufficiently}} dark, Cunningham {{gathered his}} crew at 9pm and announced {{his intention to}} escape the mutiny by sailing the Clyde out of the port {{in the next three}} hours so that they would arrive at Sheerness before daybreak. He encouraged them by declaring that if they agreed to this, Sir Harry Neale would join them with the St Fiorenzo. The crew almost unanimously agreed to this, a single voice of dissent was quickly shouted down. At midnight, Cunningham ordered the anchor raised and the Clyde silently slipped out of the port. By daybreak, Cunningham and his ship arrived at Sheerness safely away from the mutiny. The Clyde's successful escape from the mutineers cause an <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> to spread among those who agreed to follow the mutineer leaders. This distrust formed the first effective blow against the ringleaders, and soon other ships were abandoning the mutinies and returning control to their respective commanders. As a result, the mutinies soon were quashed.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Bagrat became king, the Bagratids’ drive to {{complete}} the unification of all Georgian lands had gained irreversible momentum. The kings of Georgia sat at Kutaisi in western Georgia from which they ran all {{of what had been}} the Kingdom of Abkhazia and a greater portion of Iberia/Kartli; Tao/Tayk had been lost to the Byzantines while a Muslim emir remained in Tbilisi and the kings of Kakheti obstinately defended their autonomy in easternmost Georgia. Furthermore, the loyalty of great nobles to the Georgian crown was far from stable. During Bagrat’s minority, the regency had advanced the positions of the high nobility whose influence he subsequently tried to limit when he assumed full ruling powers. Simultaneously, the Georgian crown was confronted with two formidable external foes: the Byzantine Empire and the resurgent Seljuq Turks. Although the Byzantine Empire and Georgia had centuries-long cultural and religious ties, and the Seljuqs posed a substantial threat to the empire itself, Constantinople’s aggressiveness on the Caucasian political scene contributed to an <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> and recrimination, and prevented the two Christian nations from effective cooperation against the common threat. With assertion of the Georgian Bagratid hegemony in the Caucasus being the cornerstone of Bagrat’s reign, his policy can be understood as the attempt to play the Seljuqs and Byzantines off against one another.|$|E

However, following the vote, Taffa Tabiou said on 5 March that the VSAT machines had failed and that it would therefore be necessary for all 35 electoral district directors to bring physical proof of the results to Lomé. That was unacceptable to the UFC, which said that results not transmitted through VSAT could not be trusted; it claimed that the machines had not failed but were simply switched off by the government.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{perceptions}} of {{sources of information}} on the transitional justice process in Croatia, dealing with the 1991 - 1995 conflict. This provides an insight into the broader nation-building process in Croatia by analysing where the predominant war narrative is reproduced and contested. It is based on focus group, dyad and interview research conducted in 2014 and 2015 with teachers, members of war veterans’ associations and pensioners. Respondents trusted few sources in an <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> general <b>distrust</b> and pessimism towards institutions. Participants in the conflict and images from television were, on the other hand, highly trusted. This paved the way for everyday narratives to have more of an influence than narratives presented from above by institutions, indicating that individuals and organisations concerned with the historical study of the war in Croatia are perceived to be more reliable if they also appeal to these criteria of participation and imagery, regardless of the academic merit of their investigations...|$|R
40|$|The {{events of}} 9 / 11 and the {{subsequent}} "War on Terror" activated long standing stereotypes in the United States that portrayed Muslims as fundamentally different from other Americans. In this project, I interview 15 Muslims who have served in the U. S. military since 9 / 11 to determine if and how the activation of this us/them boundary shaped their military experiences. I find that the us/them atmosphere that characterizes civilian discourse about Muslims {{is present in the}} military. However, most of my respondents felt that it had little practical effect on them. I discuss this in terms of the presence but irrelevance of this boundary. I connect this finding to the history of racial integration in the U. S. military, arguing that characteristics of the military, including an emphasis on policies of equal opportunity, the ability to compel certain behaviors, and the nature of military service, which promotes close contact among diverse individuals, can mitigate some of the negatives effects of being othered. While most of my respondents had positive experiences, in some units the us/them discourse was exacerbated, creating <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> and suspicion which led to negative outcomes including harassment, accusations, and decisions by Muslim service members to leave the military. A theme that emerged in exploring this dichotomy of experience among my respondents was the role of leadership. Leadership that saw value in diversity and was invested in supporting it, mitigated negative effects of othering, making this an irrelevant frame. However, leadership that repeated stereotypes or fears reinforced this tension, creating toxic environments in which Muslim service members felt excluded. I began this project with the expectation that citizenship would be a central narrative for Muslim service members, as it was for Japanese Americans in World War II. However, the respondents in my sample rarely use their military service to directly make claims on citizenship. They do however express institutional motivations to serve and engage in dialogue, bridge building, and other aspects of everyday citizenship...|$|R
2500|$|Some people {{suspected}} that the current fighting would ignite a full-fledged war between the United States and Mexico.

[...] On July 29, a Mexican named Adolfo Munoz was killed near San Benito for [...] "scheming to rob a local bank and having connections with armed raiders." [...] Cameron County Deputy Sheriff Frank Carr and the Texas Ranger Daniel Hinojosa arrested Munoz but, according to the officers, when they were leaving San Benito a party of eight armed men, wearing masks, forced them to give up Munoz. On the next day, Munoz's body was found about two miles from town, [...] "riddled with bullets" [...] and hanging from a tree. The lynching, whether perpetrated by the rebels or by the Texans, created an <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> among the local Mexican population for the Texas Rangers and other American police forces. J. T.

[...] A lawyer in San Benito, named William G. B. Morrison, said that Munoz's lynching was [...] "the spark that fired the flame among the white people." [...] However, a federal investigator said that the lynching was [...] "an expression of the indignation of the people against the repeated failure to enforce the laws." ...|$|E

5000|$|Money's Minister (or Controller) {{at the new}} Ministry of Shipping was Sir Joseph Maclay, a Scottish {{shipowner}} who, unusually, sat {{in neither}} House of Parliament, {{as a result of}} which Money was the ministry's spokesman in the Commons (with his own PPS, Thomas Owen Jacobsen). Maclay, who was himself strong willed and very self-disciplined, at first resisted Money's appointment, describing him to Lloyd George as [...] "very clever - but impossible, living in an <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> suspicion and <b>distrust</b> <b>of</b> everyone - satisfied only with himself and his own views". However, Lloyd George stuck by the appointment and, in the event, the two men appear to have worked in reasonable harmony. Among Money's particular achievements was developing the policy of concentrating merchant shipping in the North Atlantic, thus reducing the risk of attack from German U-boats which had been a perilous problem when goods had been brought from around the world. By the time of the Zeebrugge raid in April 1918, the use of convoys had largely contained the threat from U-boats, with every troopship of American reinforcements over the previous two months having arrived safely.|$|R
6000|$|Kells led Joan and Cleve {{from one}} part of the smoky hall to another, and they looked on at the games and the strange raw life {{manifested}} there. The place was getting packed with men. Kells's party encountered Blicky and Beady Jones together. They passed by as strangers. Then Joan saw Beard and Chick Williams arm in arm, strolling about, like roystering miners. Williams telegraphed a keen, fleeting glance at Kells, then went on, to be lost in the crowd. Handy Oliver brushed by Kells, jostled him, apparently by accident, and he said, [...] "Excuse me, mister!" [...] There were other familiar faces. Kells's gang were all in Alder Creek and the dark machinations of the bandit leader had been put into operation. What struck Joan forcibly was that, though there were hilarity and comradeship, they were not manifested in any general way. These miners were strangers to one another; the groups were strangers; the gamblers were strangers; the newcomers were strangers; and over all hung an <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>distrust.</b> Good fellowship abided only in the many small companies of men who stuck together. The mining-camps that Joan had visited had been composed of an assortment of prospectors and hunters who made one big, jolly family. This was a gold strike, and the difference was obvious. The hunting for gold was one thing, in its relation to the searchers; after it had been found, in a rich field, the conditions of life and character changed. Gold had always seemed wonderful and beautiful to Joan; she absorbed here something that was the nucleus of hate. Why could not these miners, young and old, stay in their camps and keep their gold? That was the fatality. The pursuit was a dream--a glittering allurement; the possession incited a lust for more, and that was madness. Joan felt that in these reckless, honest miners there was a liberation of the same wild element which was the driving passion of Kells's Border Legion. Gold, then, was a terrible thing.|$|E
6000|$|That {{year was}} a bad year, a year of world-wide {{economic}} disorganization. Through their want of intelligent direction the great [...] "Trust" [...] of American ironmasters, a gang of energetic, narrow-minded furnace owners, had smelted far more iron than the whole world had any demand for. (In those days there existed no means of estimating any need of that sort beforehand.) They had done this without even consulting the ironmasters of any other country. During their period of activity they had drawn into their employment {{a great number of}} workers, and had erected a huge productive plant. It is manifestly just that people who do headlong stupid things of this sort should suffer, but in the old days it was quite possible, it was customary for the real blunderers in such disasters, to shift nearly all the consequences of their incapacity. No one thought it wrong for a light-witted [...] "captain of industry" [...] who had led his workpeople into overproduction, into the disproportionate manufacture, that is to say, of some particular article, to abandon and dismiss them, nor was there anything to prevent the sudden frantic underselling of some trade rival in order to surprise and destroy his trade, secure his customers for one's own destined needs, and shift a portion of one's punishment upon him. This operation of spasmodic underselling was known as [...] "dumping." [...] The American ironmasters were now dumping on the British market. The British employers were, of course, taking their loss out of their workpeople as much as possible, but in addition they were agitating for some legislation that would prevent--not stupid relative excess in production, but [...] "dumping"--not the disease, but the consequences of the disease. The necessary knowledge to prevent either dumping or its causes, the uncorrelated production of commodities, did not exist, but this hardly weighed with them at all, and in answer to their demands there had arisen a curious party of retaliatory-protectionists who combined vague proposals for spasmodic responses to these convulsive attacks from foreign manufacturers, with the very evident intention of achieving financial adventures. The dishonest and reckless elements were indeed so evident in this movement as to add very greatly to the general <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> and insecurity, and in the recoil from the prospect of fiscal {{power in the hands of}} the class of men known as the [...] "New Financiers," [...] one heard frightened old-fashioned statesmen asserting with passion that [...] "dumping" [...] didn't occur, or that it was a very charming sort of thing to happen. Nobody would face and handle the rather intricate truth of the business. The whole effect upon the mind of a cool observer was of a covey of unsubstantial jabbering minds drifting over a series of irrational economic cataclysms, prices and employment tumbled about like towers in an earthquake, and amidst the shifting masses were the common work-people going on with their lives as well as they could, suffering, perplexed, unorganized, and for anything but violent, fruitless protests, impotent. You cannot hope now to understand the infinite want of adjustment in the old order of things. At one time there were people dying of actual starvation in India, while men were burning unsalable wheat in America. It sounds like the account of a particularly mad dream, does it not? It was a dream, a dream from which no one on earth expected an awakening.|$|E

Less than two days after Hudson's arrival at Ravna Gora, Tito and Mihailović met to make one last effort at forming a joint command, but despite Tito's request that Hudson be present during the negotiations, Mihailović insisted it was not necessary. Despite a provisional agreement, the two leaders were at cross-purposes; Tito would not place himself or his forces under Mihailović's control, and would not conform with Mihailović's urging that he cease attacks on the Germans. By this time, Mihailović knew from Ostojić that he had official recognition from the Yugoslav government-in-exile, who had also promised British recognition and support. The situation in western Serbia was one of incipient civil war. Despite some jointly-held towns and joint operations by Partisans and Chetniks, an <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> creeping <b>distrust</b> predominated between the two camps.

40|$|Considering that {{distrust}} is a core {{element of}} human interaction, {{it has received}} surprisingly little scientific attention. This research contributes to filling this gap by investigating distrust’s influence on creativity. Intuitively {{as well as in}} light <b>of</b> prior research, <b>distrust</b> and creativity appear incompatible. The social consequences <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> include reluctance to share information, a quality detrimental to creativity in social settings. At the same time, the cognitive concomitants <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> bear resemblance to creative cognition: Distrust seems to foster thinking about non-obvious alternatives to potentially deceptive appearances. This tendency resembles cognitive flexibility, which is conducive to creativity. These cognitive underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> hold the provocative implication that distrust may foster creativity. Mirroring these contradictory findings, I suggest that the social vs. cognitive consequences <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> have diverging implications for creativity. I address this question in Study 1 by introducing private/public as a moderating variable for effects <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> on creativity. Consistent with distrust’s social consequences, subliminal distrust (vs. trust) priming had detrimental effects on creative generation presumed to be public. Consistent with distrust’s cognitive consequences, though, the opposite emerged in private. Study 2 replicated a beneficial effect <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> on private creative generation with a different priming method. Studies 3 and 4 showed increased category inclusiveness vs. increased remote semantic spread after distrust priming. The latter findings are consistent with enhanced cognitive flexibility as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>distrust.</b> Taken together, these results provide evidence for the creativity-enhancing potential <b>of</b> <b>distrust</b> and suggest cognitive flexibility as the process in question...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} one of {{the more}} vexing questions facing analysts of relations between the Islamic world and the West: How can we speak about deeply divisive cultural and political issues in ways that foster conflict transformation rather than an intensification of conflict? Using narrative analysis as an approach, we examine the most common “stories” that actors identifying with Islam and the West use to organize their thinking about conflict: a story of intercultural confrontation and a story of intercultural compatibility. After noting that both Western and Muslim narrators of these stories make a number of strikingly similar claims, we conclude by suggesting that a “new story ” emphasizing intercultural complementarity can help agents of conflict transformation reframe differences and advance the cause of peaceful coexistence. It has become commonplace to observe that the Islamic world and the West appear to be mired in an intensifying cycle of political and cultural conflict, and that the most significant source of rivalry is the profoundly unsettled nature of American relations with the Muslim Middle East. In matters related to Persian Gulf geopolitics, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the politics of Islamic revivalism, American policy preferences for maintaining stability and control through a system of regional alliances are met with contrary regional preferences for dramatic change. Frictions generated by conflicting interests and desires spill over into the cultural domain, resulting in the politicization of identities and an escalatory conflict dynamic in which the basic value commitments, beliefs and mores of the “other ” are regarded as threatening and problematic. The result is an <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> doubt, <b>distrust,</b> and disrespect in which efforts to dominate and coerce adversaries displace initiatives to collaborate in a search for intercultural understanding and means of mutual political accommodation. On both sides of the troubled relationship between Americans and the Muslim Middle East, there is deep estrangement and a growing belief in the futility of communication. 2 Isla...|$|R
