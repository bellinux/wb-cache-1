25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} with some of my friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E

[...] Billingsley commissioned Tiffany & Co. to produce sterling silver Stork Club logo Victory pins as gifts for their crew members. Patrons were not always on the receiving end; Billingsley's writings claimed that one of his waiters received a $20,000 tip. [...] A bartender received a new Cadillac from a grateful patron, and a headwaiter received a $10,000 tip from tennis star Fred Perry. It was necessary for Billingsley to give the expensive gifts and to provide some or all of a celebrity's Stork Club services for free to bring the stars to the club and keep them coming back. The notables were what brought {{people from all over the}} country in all walks of life to visit the Stork Club.|$|E

They called her voice sounding as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium", while the other detractors suggested that she was [...] "almost entirely helium, a gas-filled, lighter-than-air creation of MTV and other sinister media packagers." [...] Madonna said: [...] "From the very beginning of my career, people have been writing shit about me and saying, 'She's a one-hit wonder, she'll disappear after a year'." [...] She responded to the comment [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium" [...] by doing a photoshoot with Alberto Tolot, where she flirted with a giant Mickey Mouse toy, putting its hand inside her dress and looking at it with an admonishing glare. Author Debbi Voller noted that [...] "such provocative imagery at a young age of her career, could have hurt her too much. But it went on to shut those twerps who dared to take a swag at her voice again." [...] Twenty-five years later, in her acceptance speech of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Madonna thanked the critics who snubbed her in the early years, [...] "The ones that said I was talentless, that I was chubby, that I couldn't sing, that I was a one-hit wonder.

[...] There were tears from McCain, his wife Cindy, and some of the campaign staff and delegates. [...] Many of McCain's supporters were vocally unhappy with his words of support for Bush, and the Times wrote that, [...] "Politics as usual with its compromises, cruelties and emotional costs — caught up with Senator John McCain this weekend." [...] McCain made a point of having Cindy McCain head the Arizona delegation at the convention, not his antagonist Governor Hull. [...] On August 1, the second night of the convention, McCain delivered a speech in praise of Bush, in particular trying to solidify Bush's national security and foreign policy credentials. In it, McCain connected his family to Bush's, making reference to former President George H. W. Bush's combat service as a naval aviator in the Pacific Theater of World War II under Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., McCain's grandfather. [...] He said directly of the nominee, [...] "I support him. I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> to him. And I am proud of him."

500|$|After making three {{separate}} returns in September 2013, September 2014 {{and another in}} February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of EastEnders in EastEnders Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to EastEnders in 2016, appearing in the episode broadcast on 15 January. After this, {{it was announced that}} the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor's personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: [...] "Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst , who I adore, is still in charge I want him {{to be the one to}} oversee it. I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes." [...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So this is the end of an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been working harder than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud." [...] Windsor resumed filming on 21 March 2016.|$|E

500|$|Stevenage's league {{campaign}} {{got off to}} {{a typically}} patchy start; with the side recording just one win from their first five games of the season. Following a 2–1 defeat to Oxford United in August 2009, the team went on a 17-game unbeaten run that stretched four months from August to December 2009, propelling the club into the top two. Unlike in previous seasons, the club were performing strongly away from home, and secured victories at the likes of Luton Town and Mansfield Town. A 4–1 victory against Cambridge United on New Year's Day ultimately meant that Stevenage hit top-spot {{for the first time in}} the season. However, two defeats on the road within the space of a week in February meant that rivals Oxford United had an eight–point lead going into March 2010. The team responded well, winning eight games on the bounce; including an important 1–0 victory over Oxford United in late March, subsequently replacing Oxford at the top of the table. Borough brushed aside a late challenge from Luton Town, securing promotion to the Football League with two games to spare following a 2–0 win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough. The team won their last six games of the league campaign without conceding a single goal, and recorded 42 points from a possible 45 from their last 15 league fixtures. Stevenage finished the season having amassed a total of 99 points from 44 games, winning the league by 11 points, with Westley winning many plaudits for the way he had secured promotion despite considerably less resources than a lot of the teams in the division. The promotion means Westley has led Stevenage to the Football League for the first time in their history, as well as managing a Football League team for the first time in his managerial career. Westley also guided the club to another FA Trophy Final; this time losing 2–1 after extra-time against Barrow at Wembley Stadium. At the end of the season, Westley signed a new two-year contract; keeping him contracted to the club until 2012. On signing the new deal, Westley said [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> for all the support that we have all been given in the past two years. I am delighted to have the opportunity to manage the launch of the club into the Football League". In his first two seasons back at the club, from May 2008 to May 2010, Westley has been in charge for 114 games, winning a total of 70 games – recording a win percentage of 61.40%.|$|E
