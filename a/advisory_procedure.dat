40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} {{the impact of the}} decisions of the International Court of Justice on third parties {{from the perspective of the}} general and specific guarantees available for the protection of their interests under the Court's Statute. In the first chapter, the general protection extended to third parties is considered from the viewpoint of the general principle of the relative effect of judicial decisions, their value as building blocks of the Court's jurisprudence and their role as a subsidiary legal source. The second and third chapters are devoted to a critical analysis of the nature, scope, effect and conditions for the operation of the specific third party guarantees, namely, intervention for the purpose of the protection of the interest of a third party and intervention when the construction of a convention is in issue in a pending case. The fourth chapter examines the position of third parties in relation to the Court's advisory jurisdiction by considering the nature and effect of advisory opinions, by defining and identifying "third parties" in the context of the <b>advisory</b> <b>procedure,</b> by assessing the nature and extent of their participation in advisory proceedings and by undertaking a brief empirical survey of the impact of advisory opinions on them. Finally, some of the principal observations are recapitulated and suggestions for improving and strengthening the third party safeguards, which have been explored, are offered. The main conclusion of this study is that in the final analysis the utility of the various third party safeguards considered, lies both in a liberal interpretation of the conditions governing their operation and in full participation by interested parties in contentious and advisory proceedings...|$|E
40|$|Preimplantation genetic {{diagnosis}} (PGD) is an established alternative for couples {{at high risk}} of having an affected child, with the advantage that the genetic testing is performed at the embryo stage and the couple can thereby avoid a pregnancy termination of an affected foetus. The disadvantage is that an IVF treatment is required, which can be a stressful experience. The main indications for PGD are monogenic disorders and chromosome abnormalities and there is an increasing demand for PGD each year. The PGD process can be divided into three steps 1) The IVF treatment, 2) The biopsy and 3) The genetic analysis. The aim with this thesis was to identify factors of importance for an optimal PGD and to learn more about patient’s experience of PGD in order to improve the <b>advisory</b> <b>procedure</b> and care of these patients. Another aim was to gain more knowledge regarding the segregation of different reciprocal translocations and their influence on fertility. Carriers of reciprocal translocations are usually healthy but have an increased risk of producing sperm or oocytes with an unbalanced chromosome content which gives them a high risk of repeated miscarriages, infertility and an increased risk to have an affected child. The unbalance arises during meiosis when the sperm and oocytes are formed and are present in every cell in the body in the offspring. However, some abnormalities arise after conception during the early embryo development resulting in mosaicism where some cells have the abnormality and some do not. This was the case in Paper I where germline mosaicism was demonstrated to be the cause of repeated pregnancies with the same unbalanced chromosome abnormality, although karyotypes from both parents initially were interpreted to be normal. Extended investigations with microsatellite markers and FISH analysis revealed the same abnormality in 4 - 6 % of the mother’s fibroblasts. The couple went through four PGD cycles and the abnormality was found in 35 % of the embryos. The low level mosaicism in the fibroblasts gave no phenotypic symptoms but since the abnormality seemed to be present at a higher frequency in her gonads, there was a high” hidden” recurrence risk for affected offspring or repeated miscarriages. In Paper II a linear regression analysis was performed of data from all 569 PGD cycles performed between 1996 and 2009. We found two factors of significant importance for the PGD outcome. Firstly, the age of the woman at stimulation start where women under 36 years were {{three times more likely to}} achieve a pregnancy P = 0. 003 and odds ratio 3. 1 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 5 - 6. 5]. Secondly, the number of biopsied cells from each embryo where PGD cycles with one cell removal were twice as likely to result in a pregnancy compared to those cycles were two cells had been removed P = 0. 0013 and odds ratio 2. 55 (95 % CI 1. 44 – 4. 52). Accordingly, we have now introduced an age limit of 40 years at stimulation start for the woman and changed policy to one cell biopsy for almost all indications since 2009. Paper III was based on statistical analyses of data from a survey study concerning the experience of PGD between June 2005 and 2011. A questionnaire was sent to 222 couples and 146 answered, of which 20 % had the experience from a pregnancy termination of an affected foetus, one third had the experience of previous traditional prenatal diagnosis and 35 % had given birth to an affected child. The results showed that couples with monogenic disorders choose PGD because of an objection to pregnancy termination for psychological reasons while carriers of chromosome abnormalities opted for PGD because of previous miscarriages. We could confirm that there is an extensive stress associated with PGD and that the couples seemed to have been less prepared for the psychological stress than for the physical stress. It has previously been suggested that a sperm FISH analysis could predict the PGD outcome and that there is a linear correlation between the proportion of abnormal sperm and the proportion of abnormal embryos. In Paper IV sperm FISH analyses from ten male carriers of different reciprocal translocations was performed in connection with their first PGD and the result from sperm and embryos were compared. We found a difference with an increase of unbalanced embryos compared to sperm with no linear correlation. We could confirm that the number of balanced embryos available for transfer correlates to the pregnancy rate. In conclusion, PGD is a valuable and preferred reproductive alternative for couples {{at high risk of}} having a child with a severe genetic disorder. It is a rapidly developing field worldwide and new techniques as well as new indications are continuously announced. It is of great importance that medical and ethical aspects are considered and up to date before the introduction of new methods and that new techniques are constantly evaluated regarding accuracy and safety, in order to optimise the PGD program...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a brief review {{and analysis of}} advisory proceedings before the International Court of Justice {{as well as an}} explanation of the nature and importance of advisory opinions as specific decisions of the International Court of Justice. The intention was to make the public more familiar with the nature of these proceedings drawing attention of the professional public to some specific elements that characterize <b>advisory</b> <b>procedures,</b> which in a sense make them closer to the proceedings in resolving disputes between states. Although not binding by their nature as are decisions of the Court, advisory opinions have, however, some weight and importance that primarily stem from the importance and authority of the body that provides them. A non-binding effect of advisory opinions is just a starting point in explaining them. Actually, it is the fact that opinions have a great authority and this requires some further explanations...|$|R

40|$|Farmers {{have been}} slow to adopt {{decision}} support system (DSS) models and their outputs, mainly owing to (i) the complexity of the data involved, which most potential users are unable to collect and process; and (ii) inability to integrate these models into real representations of their informational environments. This situation raises questions about the way farm management researchers have modelled information and information management, and especially {{about the quality of the}} information assessed by the farmers. We consider that to review <b>advisory</b> <b>procedures</b> we need to understand how farmers select and use farm management-related information, rather than focusing on decisions made in particular situations. The aim of this study was to build a conceptual model of the farmer-targeted farm management-related information system. This model was developed using data collected in commercial beef cattle farms. The design structure and operational procedures are based on (i) data categories representing the diversity of the informational activity; and (ii) selected criteria for supporting decisions. The model is composed of two subsystems, each composed of two units. First, an organizational subsystem organizes, finalizes and monitors informational activity. Second, a processing subsystem builds and exploits the informational resources. This conceptual model makes it possible to describe and understand the diverse range of farmers’ informational activity by taking into account both the flow of information and the way farmers make sense of that information. This model could serve as a component of biodecisional DSS models for assigning information in the decision-making process. The next task will be to take into account the broad range of farmers’ perceptions of the management situations in DSS model...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{following}} {{case study}} examines the workings, consequences and {{lessons to be}} learned from a reform of FDA <b>advisory</b> committee decision-making <b>procedures.</b> Up to July 2007, the public voting practiced in these committees was oral and sequential: members sitting around a table expressed their preference in turn. In August 2007 secret-public voting was introduced, first in the imperfect form of hand-raising, then (a few months later and ever since) more systematically in the form of electronic voting. FDA advisory committees constitute an interesting case in terms of methodology because they can be studied both qualitatively and quantitatively: debates and voting are public and recorded in full in easily accessible verbatim minutes. But advisory committee voting is interesting for another reason. The 2007 reform replaced public voting with secret-public voting, but it also replaced oral voting, which left ample opportunity to individual members to express themselves, with “manual” followed by digital voting, which precludes all such expression. It therefore enables us to study two distinct yet intertwined phenomena, a seldom encountered situation of great general value: the history of the shift from public to secret voting, mainly in the area of political elections, has often gone together with changes in the way choices are expressed, and the specific impact of those changes has not always been fully measured. As we shall see in this particular case, the impact of oral voting and of abolishing that method has been underestimated...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the aspects of expert advice that decision makers find most useful in the development of evidence-based guidance and to identify the characteristics of experts providing the most useful advice. Methods: First, semi-structured interviews were conducted with seventeen members of the Interventional <b>Procedures</b> <b>Advisory</b> Committee of the UK's National Institute of Health and Care Excellence. Interviews examined the usefulness of expert advice during guidance development. Transcripts were analyzed inductively to identify themes. Second, data were extracted from 211 experts’ questionnaires for forty-one consecutive procedures. Usefulness of advice was scored using an index developed through the qualitative work. Associations between usefulness score and characteristics of the expert advisor were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Expert opinion was seen as a valued complement to empirical evidence, providing context and tacit knowledge unavailable in published literature, but helpful for interpreting it. Interviewees also valued advice on the training and experience required to perform a procedure, on patient selection criteria and the place of a procedure within a clinical management pathway. Limitations of bias in expert opinion were widely acknowledged and skepticism expressed regarding the anecdotal nature of advice on safety or efficacy outcomes. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that the most useful advice was given by clinical experts with direct personal experience of the procedure, particularly research experience. Conclusions: Evidence-based guidance production is often characterized as a rational, pipeline process. This ignores the valuable role that expert opinion plays in guidance development, complementing and supporting the interpretation of empirical data...|$|R
40|$|In 1938, {{the passage}} of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) {{established}} discovery practice. Discovery was idealistically intended to be a cooperative and self- regulating process that would function largely free from judicial intervention. But modern electronic-discovery (e-discovery) practice has strayed from these cooperative ideals, and discovery has instead come to rely on judicial intervention. Due to recent technological advances that were unforeseen when the FRCP were amended in 2006 — such as predictive coding, metadata, and shadow copies—the FRCP cannot properly govern modern e-discovery. E-discovery practice’s status quo is plainly ineffective—it is hugely burdensome and expensive, and is an obstacle rather than a tool. E-discovery’s issues must be confronted head-on. Many have requested that the Advisory Committee on the Rules of Civil <b>Procedure</b> (<b>Advisory</b> Committee) amend the FRCP in order to remedy these issues. In response, the Advisory Committee is currently discussing the idea of limiting evidence spoliation by adding a data-preservation duty on potential litigants. But recent technological advances and judicial activity render this proposal insufficient—the FRCP must be amended to recognize that e-discovery will perpetually present novel threats. E-discovery’s modern threats require constant judicial intervention, so to maintain discovery’s cooperative spirit towards fact-finding, the court must be brought in at litigation’s earliest stages. This Comment proposes that the Rule 26 (f) discovery conference be amended to bring the court in at the earliest stage of discovery. Amending Rule 26 (f) in this way recognizes that e-discovery is perpetually evolving, and would create a versatile discovery system that can efficiently react to novel issues that will inevitably arise. Part I of this Comment discusses the FRCP’s current e-discovery framework and the mechanical evolution of the Rule 26 (f) conference. Part II gives an overview and evaluation of the current dialogue on whether the FRCP should be amended in light of modern e-discovery law’s shortcomings. Part III considers three contemporary developments in the e-discovery landscape—predictive coding, metadata, and shadow copies—and gives light to the FRCP’s current failures in effectively managing e- discovery. Part IV proposes an amendment to the Rule 26 (f) discovery conference, which would give the court an active managerial role at this early litigation stage. Finally, Part V demonstrates the benefits of this proposed amendment by applying it to a current issue—the federal circuit split on which costs relating to the production of electronically stored information (ESI) are recoverable by the prevailing party...|$|R
