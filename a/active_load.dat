25|$|The {{negative}} feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier {{to compare the}} input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a common emitter stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (a better design would probably use some form of <b>active</b> <b>load</b> here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in class A. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push–pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide {{the majority of the}} current amplification (while consuming low quiescent current) and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).|$|E

Using these expressions, the radio frequency interference (RFI) demodulation in bipolar operational amplifiers, using <b>active</b> <b>loaded</b> common-emitter and differential pair amplifiers can be predicted.

2500|$|The {{negative}} feedback introduced by resistors RE {{can be seen}} in these parameters. For example, when used as an <b>active</b> <b>load</b> in a differential amplifier, I1 ≈ −I2, making the output impedance of the mirror approximately R22 -R21 ≈ 2 β rORE /(rπ + 2RE) compared to only rO without feedback (that is with RE = 0 Ω) [...] At the same time, the impedance on the reference side of the mirror is approximately [...] R11−R12 ≈ , only a moderate value, but still larger than rE with no feedback. In the differential amplifier application, a large output resistance increases the difference-mode gain, a good thing, and a small mirror input resistance is desirable to avoid Miller effect.|$|E

Trees also exhibit high solute concentrations and low hydraulic conductivity and thus are thought to be passive loaders. Based on early research, scientists correlated herbaceous species with <b>active</b> <b>loading</b> and trees and other woody species with passive loading. However, in 2011, Davidson et al. examined the correlation between growth from and phloem-loading strategy. They found that a loose association exists but not a definitive correlation.

40|$|Time-domain {{modelling}} of wave-energy devices is important. This {{is due to}} {{the need}} for information on the device’s transient response characteristics; even when linear potential theory is assumed when modelling hydrodynamic loads, significant non-linearities may be present in the system due to the power-take off (PTO), mooring, and control subsystems.

50|$|For voltage amplification, {{the range}} of allowed output voltage swing in this {{amplifier}} is tied to voltage gain when a resistor load RC is employed, as in Figure 1. That is, large voltage gain requires large RC, and that in turn implies a large DC voltage drop across RC. For a given supply voltage, the larger this drop, the smaller the transistor VCB and the less output swing is allowed before saturation of the transistor occurs, with resultant distortion of the output signal. To avoid this situation, an <b>active</b> <b>load</b> can be used, for example, a current mirror. If this choice is made, the value of RC in the table above is replaced by the small-signal output resistance of the <b>active</b> <b>load,</b> which is generally at least {{as large as the}} rO of the active transistor in Figure 1. On the other hand, the DC voltage drop across the <b>active</b> <b>load</b> has a fixed low value (the compliance voltage of the <b>active</b> <b>load),</b> much less than the DC voltage drop incurred for comparable gain using a resistor RC. That is, an <b>active</b> <b>load</b> imposes less restriction on the output voltage swing. Notice that <b>active</b> <b>load</b> or not, large AC gain still is coupled to large AC output resistance, which leads to poor voltage division at the output except for large loads RL ≫ Rout.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{rigorous}} and mathematically consistent technique for circuit analysis of modern electrical power systems consisting in the interconnection of three-phase components and single-phase <b>active</b> <b>loads.</b> Indeed, {{it is well known}} that the standard technique based on the symmetrical components transformation is commonly used in the analysis of symmetrical threephase systems.

Using this novel method, binary ethosomes containing total alkaloids extracted from Sophora alopecuroides (TASA) were prepared successfully at the temperature below the phase transition temperature (Tc) of the phosphatidyl choline (PC). Several factors affecting this method were investigated. The qualities of the TASA binary ethosomes were characterized by the shape, particle size, and encapsulation efficiency (EE). The percutaneous absorption study of TASA binary ethosomes was performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy and Franz diffusion cells. The results showed that more than 90 % sophoridine, 47 % matrine, 35 % sophocarpine, and 32 % lemannine in TASA were entrapped within 1  h at 40 °C, with an efficiency improvement of 8. 87, 8. 10, 7. 63, and 7. 78 -fold than those observed in passive loading method.
