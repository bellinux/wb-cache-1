40|$|In this paper, an {{innovative}} heuristic for domestic loads management is proposed. The method is straightforward {{and easy to}} be implemented on embedded systems. The idea is to start from the mathematical modeling of loads and to perform a profile based scheduling, namely loads will try to fit a given schedule. The solution of the scheduling {{is based on a}} rolling horizon of 24 hours and is recomputed when <b>an</b> <b>ON</b> <b>signal</b> is provided to the considered appliance. Experimental results show the pertinence of the approach and how it may be profitably used to lower the energy costs for the end user...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Verrucarin A is an {{inhibitor}} {{of protein}} synthesis. In this study, {{we examined the}} inhibitory action of verrucarin <b>A</b> <b>on</b> <b>signal</b> molecules. Verrucarin <b>A</b> partially inhibited the IL- 8 production of a PMA-stimulated promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL- 60 cells), and the effect {{was related to the}} inhibition of NF-ÃŽÂºB activation at noncytotoxic concentrations. Moreover, the inhibition of mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase by verrucarin A was especially strong with p 38 - and JNK-phosphorylation. The findings show a new action of verrucarin A, and it is expected that this action relaxes the signal activation in response to stress...|$|R
