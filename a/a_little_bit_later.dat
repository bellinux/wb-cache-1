Canadian sales of the Geo Metro only began in 1992, after {{the demise of the}} Asüna brand. For 1990, the Metro's second model year, Geo introduced the Metro LSi models, which included an automatic transmission, air conditioning and a stereo with cassette player. Geo also introduced the frugal XFi model, featuring a lower powered economy-tuned version of the three-cylinder engine, a higher final drive gear ratio, and certain deleted interior amenities (e.g., the passenger mirror). It thereby achieved 43 city, 51 highway per the revised 2007 EPA mileage standards. XFi made up less than 10% of Metro sales. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>later,</b> the Japanese-built convertible model debuted, available in LSi trim. In 1991, GM increased convertible production and added paint options. In 1992, the Metro received a facelift with new hubcaps, exterior modification and new interior controls.|$|E

The music has a basic chord progression of A–E–F#m–D.

The {{first half of the}} race was slow, 5000 metres lap time being only 14:13.07. At 5800 metres, Paul Kipkoech changed pace and left other runners behind. Francesco Panetta, Salvatore Antibo and Vainio started their pursuit <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> and were not able to properly challenge Kipkoech. Subsequently, Kipkoech was far ahead of the other runners and the officials decremented the lap table, which displays the remaining laps for the runners, immediately after Kipkoech passed the finish line after each round. As a result, Vainio and some other runners became confused about the remaining laps, started their sprint 400 metres too early and finished the race after 9600 metres. Some runners continued the race after their [...] "first finish", but Vainio was too tired to realize the situation. Vainio also competed in the Marathon, but after a fairly good start he did not finish. At the Track & Field News annual world ranking, Vainio was recognized as the seventh best runner in 10,000 metres.|$|E

When Peyton comes back home, she reveals to him that she did come to the signing, and then inspires him by repeating his quote: [...] "Your art matters". When he tells Peyton that the bartender she is flirting with at the Clothes Over Bros store opening {{is not good enough}} for her, it becomes obvious that, despite his relationship with Lindsey, he still loves Peyton. After remembering the night he proposed, he goes straight to her house, though she is not there. When Peyton begins to antagonize Lindsey, he goes to confront her, but things escalate into a verbal fight about their break up. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>later,</b> after Peyton confesses her feelings and kisses him, he kisses her back, passionately, but later proposes to Lindsey, leading Peyton to tell him that she will bury her feelings so that he can be happy. He then wins his first game as the Ravens coach, although the female counterparts miss it because they were locked in the library. He soon has to go to Dan's parole and speak up in order to have him stay locked up. He decides to have Nathan as his best man and then fuses his bachelor party with Lindsey's. He also gives Haley his new book, and she tells him not to marry Lindsey after reading it. Lucas proceeds with the wedding, but Lindsey stops him after realizing his book is about Peyton. She leaves him, and when he chases after her, he sees Lindsey's bags packed. After a confrontation, she leaves him, saying, [...] "People always leave, Luke. You know that." [...] (A reference to one of Peyton's famous lines, also featured in his first book.) Lucas flees to stay with his mother and Andy after the failed wedding. Andy convinces Lucas to go after Lindsey, prompting him to go to her and tell her that one day she will come back to him. She comes back to Tree Hill for Jamie's 5th birthday, but tells Lucas that it was really over. He then helps Brooke cope with having baby Angie around. After Lindsey calls him to tell him she is seeing someone, he blows up after an opposing player gets away with attempting to injure Quentin Fields, drawing himself a 10-game suspension. He becomes heavily drunk and tells Peyton he hates her when she comes to his help. He later apologizes to her after being confronted by Haley. He tells her that it was hard to let her go, hard to see her and that it remains difficult for him, making apparent his love for Peyton. Lindsey comes by to tell him his book is over and he can e-mail her the dedication. When he does, she reveals by phone that she still loves him. He then decides to go to Las Vegas and calls someone to get married. Brooke, Peyton, and Lindsey are all shown answering the phone, and the viewers are left hanging as to whom he decides to propose to.|$|E
