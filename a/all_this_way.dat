500|$|Covering {{the event}} for Doctor Who Magazine, David Darlington {{noted that the}} stated aim of the Proms is [...] "to {{encourage}} an audience for concert hall music who, though not normally attending classical concerts, would be attracted by the low ticket prices and informal atmosphere" [...] and concluded that if {{the children in the}} audience had such a love for Doctor Who [...] "that they have come <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> to spend an hour or two listening to the music from the show, and that they will happily also sit through a formal, experimental and rather abrasive piece of modern classical music and then enthusiastically applaud at the end, then all concerned can be happy with their day's work." ...|$|E
500|$|Hornish again {{returned}} to Penske in 2006. The team changed manufacturers, joining Honda when Toyota and Chevrolet left the series after the 2005 season. His season highlight was the Indianapolis 500, {{when he passed}} Marco Andretti for the lead on the final lap {{to win in the}} second-closest margin of victory in the race's history. Hornish later said about the pass, [...] "I figured I came <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> I ought to give myself one more shot at it. I kind of looked at it as, I was going to drive over him if I had to. For Marco to come as a rookie and drive like that he should be proud no matter what." [...] His second win of the season was at Richmond (after leading for all but 38 laps), and he took the points lead after winning the next race at Kansas. His fourth and final win of the season was at Kentucky, when he started second and led for 57 laps. In the season-ending race at Chicagoland Hornish qualified for the pole position and finished third, clinching his third series championship and Penske's first. Although he and Dan Wheldon finished the year with the same number of points, the tie was broken by wins; Hornish had four, and Wheldon two.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the fall}} of the Paterangi line, Wiremu Tamihana, leading one of the two major Kingite divisions, retreated east to Maungatautari to block a British advance up the Waikato River into Ngati Raukawa {{territory}} and Matamata beyond. Cameron remained at Rangiaowhia, preparing to pursue him. Rewi Maniapoto, with the other main division, moved south into the Hangitiki Valley to defend Ngati Maniapoto bases. Ngati Maniapoto fighters and their allies remained determined to continue the war, but were divided over their strategy: whether to guard the hinterland with large defensive systems on the fringes, or to challenge the nearby occupying forces with a new pa. Rewi deferred a decision until he could consult with Tamihana, the kingmaker, and set out with a small group to Tamihana's stronghold near present-day Cambridge on the upper Waikato. On the way he encountered a group of about 140 of the dispersed Paterangi army, mainly warriors from distant Tuhoe and Ngati Raukawa iwi. The Tuhoe chiefs urged Rewi to build a pa at the agricultural village of Ōrākau, near Kihikihi, to challenge the troops, explaining that their guns and ammunition had been carried a long distance and were [...] "too heavy to carry <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> for nothing". Although he strongly opposed the plan, convinced it would result in their defeat, Rewi relented—possibly in return for the loyalty they had shown in crossing the North Island to join the fight for his territory—and accompanied them back to Ōrākau, arriving about 28 March.|$|E

2500|$|Brian Close was {{replaced}} by Colin Cowdrey for the MCC tour of the West Indies in 1967–68, his third spell as England captain and {{he was determined to}} make a success of it. Barrington and the MCC fared poorly in the run up matches and with West Indian supporters constantly telling him [...] "Charlie's waiting for you man. He'll kill you". Barrington was so upset that told his wife that he wouldn't tour again. In the First Test at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad Cowdrey won the toss and batted with Boycott and Edrich adding 80 for the first wicket and Barrington coming in against the spinners at 110/2. Soon after Gary Sobers responded to the crowd and brought on Griffith, but Barrington twice called him to halt as the chanting of the crowd interfered with his concentration. Although hit with bouncers on the shoulders and back he survived the five over spell and the tired bowler was taken off. He brought up his 50 with a six off Lance Gibbs and added 134 with Cowdrey and 188 with Tom Graveney before hitting Gibbs for another six to bring up his 20th century. When he saw the ball sailing into the stands the 37-year-old Barrington took off his cap and waved his fist in triumph. He was finally caught by Griffith off Gibbs for 143, the second time that he had made a century in four successive Tests. England made 568 and the West Indies followed on (Barrington dismissing Sobers), but survived the last day on 243/8 for a draw. Barrington made 63 in the Second Test at Sabina Park, Jamaica, again stopping Griffith's run up as the crowd went wild. John Snow took 7/49 and the West Indies followed on again, but when the local favourite Basil Butcher was out at 204/5 the crowd disagreed with the decision and rioted, even though Butcher had walked. Tear gas was used by the Jamaican police to restore order and play resumed, but the England team lost their hold on the game as Sobers made 113 not out and the West indies 391/9. Needing only 159 to win England collapsed to 68/8 (Barrington 13), but somehow managed a draw. The Third Test at Bridgetown, Barbados was another draw (Barrington 17) and the Fourth back at Trinidad looked like going the same way. The West Indies had made 526/7 and England replied with 404, where Cowdrey (148) and Barrington (48) added 133 for the third wicket. Sobers, remembering the England collapse in the Second Test declared at 92/2 leaving England 215 to win in 135 minutes, a run-rate they had yet to achieve in the series [...] Cowdrey was uncertain, but Barrington convinced him to go for the win, shouting [...] "Will we go for it? Of course we'll go for it. That's what we've come <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> for, isn't it?" [...] Barrington did not bat, but England made 215/3 and won by seven wickets. Sobers was lambasted by the Caribbean press for his cavalier declaration, but responded in the Fifth Test in Georgetown, Guyana with 152 and 95 not out, Barrington taking his wicket again in the first innings, and England were struggling at 206/9 when stumps were pulled on the last day, but they drew the match and won the series. Barrington had made only 4 and 0, but finished with 288 runs (41.14) and 5 wickets (51.40), having dismissed Sobers and Seymour Nurse twice each and the opener Steve Camacho.|$|E
