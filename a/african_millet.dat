40|$|Finger millet (Eleusine coracana L.) is {{also known}} as <b>African</b> <b>millet</b> and is {{commonly}} called “ragi” in India. It has excellent nutritional value and is even superior to other common cereals. It is a richest source of calcium (344  mg) and magnesium (408  mg) than other millets. Predominant fatty acids of this millet are oleic (49 %), linoleic (25 %), and palmitic acids (25 %). Finger millet contains both water-soluble and lipo-soluble vitamins. Emerging bakery products prepared from this millet are pasta, noodles, vermicelli, and bread. Being gluten free, it is suitable for individuals suffering from celiac disease. Finger millet grain is a rich source of several phytochemicals. Finger millet possesses blood glucose lowering, cholesterol lowering, and antiulcerative, wound healing properties as indicated by in vitro and in vivo studies. Commonly used processing techniques for this millet are milling, malting, popping, and decortications...|$|E

Salt Absorption by Forage Grasses from Soils, and Decomposition of the Harvests in Soils. Noritsugu SHIMADA, Yukio SATO, Shoichi ASHIHARA, Hisakazu OIZUMI, Yasuo TAKASAKI, Zenichi KANARI and Hiroshi NOJIMA. Faculty of Horticulture, Chiba University, Matsudo, Japan. Tech. Bull. Fac. Hort. Chiba Univ., No. 26 : 15 - 21, 1979. Short term {{cultivation}} of forage grasses in summer with pot experiment was examined as a countermeasure to prevent salt accumulation in soils, which frequently occured {{in the growth}} under structure. Four species of forage grasses (corn, sorgo, <b>African</b> <b>millet</b> and rhodesgrass) were cultivated on the soils in which the salt concentrations were varied into four nutrient levels. The greatest absorption of salts was observed in corn. Dry matter yields of <b>African</b> <b>millet</b> was much smaller than that of corn, but {{the total amount of}} salts absorbed by a single plant of this species was next to corn and nearly equal to that of sorgo, having relatively high concentration of each elements. EC values of soil solutions were lowered down by the {{cultivation of}} the forage grasses, corresponding to the amount of salts absorbed by the crops. Model experiments on the mineralization of the harvests in soils were carried out to evaluate them as a organic material for soil improvement. During 20 days of incubation, both corn and sorgo added into soils accelerated the organization of inorganic nitrogen which was previously contained in the soils or derived from themselves in this period. Even 30 days of incubation, the amount of inorganic nitrogen in the corn-added soil was less than that in blank soil. It was recognized that potassium contained in forage grasses was rapidly dissolved into soils after incubation. 施設栽培でしばしば問題となる土壤の塩類集積を防止する対策の一つとして, イネ科飼料作物の夏季短期栽培について検討した. また青刈した収穫物を有機質資材として利用するために, 土壤中における養分の無機化についてモデル実験を行なった. 塩類濃度の異なる 4 段階の土壤を充てんしたポットに栽培されたトウモロコシ, ソルゴー, シコクビエ, ローズグラスのうちで肥料成分の吸収が最も多かったのはトウモロコシであった. シコクビエは乾物生産量は劣ったが, 各元素の含有率が高いために吸収量はトウモロコシにつぎ, ソルゴーと同程度であった. イネ科飼料作物の栽培により土壤のECは低下し, その値は作物の養分吸収量と対応していた. トウモロコシとソルゴーの地上部収穫物を土壤に添加し, 無機化に関する室内実験を行なった結果, 2 草種とも 20 日間のインキュベーションでは土壤の無機態窒素の有機化を促進し, 30 日間でもトウモロコシ添加区ではブランクの土壤よりも無機態窒素量は減少した. 一方植物体のカリウムは速やかに土壤中に溶出してくることがわかった...|$|E
40|$|According to Lloyd Rooney, Distinguished Professor of Food Science at Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M, “A consistent, {{high quality}} grain supply {{is the first}} {{prerequisite}} {{for the development of}} the food processing industry in West Africa. ” The International Sorghum and Millet (INTSORMIL) Collaborative Research Support Program in West Africa is helping farmers produce a consistent supply of high quality sorghum and millet that meets the requirements of industry. INTSORMIL’s Marketing-Processing Project, funded by USAID/WARP and directed by Botorou Ouendeba, Nigerien millet breeder and former Coordinator of the West and Central <b>African</b> <b>Millet</b> Research Network is responding to the emerging market demand by promoting the development and transfer of sorghum and millet technology that increases production to meet the needs of the food and feed processors. This involves increasing the supply of clean millet and sorghum grain so that the food industry can process food products such as steamed millet in yoghurt, couscous, arraw, degue, sankal, thiackri, and other products. A key component of this project is the strengthening of the bonds between the producers (farmers) and the animal feed and food processors.

40|$|The {{phenotype}} {{of medium}} duration pearl millet varieties grown in West Africa {{differs from that}} of the shorter duration millets grown in India. African varieties are usually much taller, have longer panicles, fewer productive tillers, and a lower ratio of grain to above-ground dry-matter (harvest index). The effect of crop duration on plant phenotype was investigated in two hybrids using extended daylengths to increase the duration of the vegetative phase (GSl: sowing to panicle initiation). The two hybrids, 841 A × J 104 and 81 A × Souna B, were considered to represent the Indian and African phenotype, respectively. Tiller production and survival, leaf area, and dry-matter accumulation and partition, were monitored over the season. Grain yield and its components were determined at maturity. The two hybrids responded similarly to the short and long daylength treatments. The duration of GSl was increased from 20 to 30 days, resulting in increased number of leaves, leaf area, and stem and total dry-matter accumulation; there was no effect on tiller production and survival, or on panicle growth rate. Grain yield was, therefore, the same in both GSl treatments, and harvest index (HI) was much reduced in the long GSl treatment owing to the increased stem growth. One evident effect of a longer GSl was on dry-matter partitioning between shoots; partitioning to the main stem (MS) was increased, whereas partitioning to the tillers was reduced. There was no difference in crop development, growth or yield between the two hybrids in either GSl treatment. The only significant differences were in the efficiency with which intercepted radiation was converted to dry matter, which was greater in 841 A × J 104 than in 81 A × Souna B, and in the balance between MS and tillers; the grain yield of the MS was significantly greater in 81 A x Souna B than in 841 A × J 104, but at the expense of number of productive tillers. The results demonstrate that both African and Indian phenotypes are equally productive under good agronomic conditions. The lower HI in longer duration <b>African</b> <b>millets</b> is a consequence of a much extended stem growth phase and therefore increased competition between stem and panicle during grain filling. Possible ways to increase grain yield in the medium duration <b>African</b> <b>millets</b> are considered...|$|R

Substantial diversity was observed in all the characters studied. Diversity was more among the countries than within the country. Flowering time ranged from 50 to 120 days. The early flowering accessions are found in Burundi and late flowering accessions in Ethiopia. Plant height ranged from 55 to 240 cm {{with a mean of}} 104 to 120 cm. Dwarf accessions were from Kenya, whereas tallest accessions were from Uganda. Basal tillers per plant ranged from 1 to 40 and culm branches per plant ranged from 0 to 10.

We screened the isolates for the abilities to survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract and to synthesize folate and riboflavin. The isolates were also tested in vitro for their abilities to survive exposure to bile salts and to survive at pH 2. Because the ability to hydrolyze starch confers an ecological advantage on LAB that grow in starchy matrixes as well as improving the nutritional properties of the gruels, we screened for genes involved in starch metabolism. The results showed that genes with the potential ability to survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract were widely distributed among isolates and metagenomes, whereas in vitro tests showed that only a limited set of isolates, mainly those belonging to L. fermentum, could tolerate a low pH. In contrast, the wide distribution of genes associated with bile salt tolerance, in particular bsh, {{is consistent with the}} high frequency of tolerance to bile salts observed.

Like many other species, pearl millet secretes germination stimulants (strigolactones) {{into the soil}} in response to mineral nutrient deficiency, which triggers Striga seed germination resulting in infection. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of different doses of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer on strigolactone production and Striga infection in three different <b>African</b> pearl <b>millet</b> cultivars (KBH, Sadore Local and Striga resistance). All the pearl millet genotypes produced varying amounts of different strigolactones like orobanchol, epi-orobanchol, orobanchyl acetate and 5 -deoxystrigol, the level of which decreases with increasing doses of DAP. The control treatment (no DAP) showed maximum Striga germination, emergence and dry biomass production in all cultivars of pearl millet. Supply of DAP fertilizer up to 4 g per hill suppressed Striga germination by 69, 64 and 59 %; emergence by 87, 85 and 95 % and dry biomass by 91, 98 and 83 % in cvs KBH, Sadore Local and Striga Resistance, respectively.

40|$|Fifteen (15) west <b>African</b> pearl <b>millet</b> {{varieties}} comprising eight (8) from Senegal {{and seven}} (7) from Côte d’Ivoire were characterized for their physico-chemical and technological qualities. Thousand grains weight ranged from 5. 98 g to 9. 94 g; Mean {{and standard deviation}} values for this parameter were respectively 8. 03 g and 0. 18. Five Côte d’Ivoire varieties and three from Senegal are above this mean value. They are SRR 2, VPCN, VPNW, VPNE and LOCAL FERKE for Côte d’Ivoire and for Senegal: ISMI 9102, ISMI 9301 and ISMI 9303. Having the highest 1000 grains weight, they consequently will present better outputs potential millers. The contents of proteins ranged from 8. 31 % to 12. 01 % for all the varieties with 10. 52 % mean value. All Senegalese varieties are above the mean value while only one Côte d’Ivoire variety (VPP) is above. Fat content in the grains values ranged from 4. 75 % to 5. 90 % and the mean value is 5. 14. Five varieties from Senegal and three from Côte d’Ivoire are superior to the mean. The best varieties for fat contents were ISMI 9102, ISMI 9303, ISMI 9305 and SOUNA 3 for Senegal then SRR 2, VPNE and LOCAL FERKE for Côte d’Ivoire. The phosphorus contents mean value is 0. 30 for the fifteen varieties. Five Senegalese varieties and three Côte d’Ivoire varieties are above this mean value.

40|$|Background: Genetic {{diversity}} of finger millet (Eleusine coracana), a nutritious neglected staple cereal in Africa and South Asia is largely uncharacterized. This study analysed 82 published SSR markers for finger millet across 10 diverse accessions to compile an informative set for genetic characterisation. Extensive optimization compared single samples with bulked leaf or bulked DNA samples for capturing within accession genetic diversity. The markers were evaluated to determine (1) how efficiently they amplified target loci during high-throughput genotyping with a generic PCR protocol, (2) ease of scoring PCR products and (3) polymorphism {{and ability to}} discern genetic diversity within the tested finger millet germplasm. Results: Across 88 samples, the 52 markers that worked well amplified 274 alleles, ranging from 2 to 14 per locus {{with a mean of}} 4. 89.

40|$|Published online: 18 Sep 2015 Traditional and {{improved}} varieties of maize, pearl millet and sorghum were planted by small-scale farmers {{under the direction}} of the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture in two Nigerian agro-ecological zones: the Sudan Savanna and the Northern Guinea Savanna. Samples were collected for the determination of Fusarium infection and fumonisin (B 1, B 2 and B 3) contamination. A previous paper reported Aspergillus infection and aflatoxin contamination of these samples. Fusarium infection levels, measured by per cent kernels infected, were modest with mean levels for the above cereals of 16 % ± 11 % (SD), 12 % ± 7 % and 13 % ± 16 %, respectively. However, the Fusarium species recovered from maize were predominantly the fumonisin producers F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum, together making an infection rate of 15 % ± 10 %, whereas these species were present to a limited extent only in the other two cereals, 1 % ± 1 % for pearl millet and 2 % ± 6 % for sorghum. Fumonisin contamination was variable but reflected the diversity of Fusarium producers in these three cereals. Mean levels were 228 ± 579 µg kg– 1 (range < 5 – 2860 µg kg– 1) for maize, 18 ± 7 µg kg– 1 (range = 6 – 29 µg kg– 1) for pearl millet and 131 ± 270 µg kg– 1 (range < 5 – 1340 µg kg– 1) for sorghum. Together with previous results on aflatoxin, this study confirmed the co-occurrence of aflatoxins and fumonisins in maize as well as in the traditional <b>African</b> cereals, <b>millet</b> and sorghum (89 % co-occurrence across all three cereals). The low fumonisin levels may be ascribed to the use of good agricultural practices. Of the Fusarium species present, those in maize consisted mainly of fumonisin producers, the opposite of what was observed in pearl millet and sorghum. It is concluded that replacement of maize by pearl millet and sorghum could improve food safety with regards to aflatoxin B and fumonisin B exposure. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale {{excavations}} {{were recently}} undertaken {{at the site}} of Ukunju Cave in the Mafia Archipelago, Tanzania, to collect new bioarchaeological and material culture data relating to the site 2 ̆ 7 s occupation and the nature of early subsistence and long-distance trade in the region. Our findings suggest that occupation of the cave began during the Middle Iron Age (MIA, seventh to tenth centuries AD), as indicated by the presence of local Early Tana Tradition (ETT) /Triangular Incised Ware (TIW) pottery in the lowest layers above bedrock, as well as small quantities of imported ceramics and glass beads also dating from the mid- to the late first millennium AD. Small assemblages of faunal and botanical remains, including introduced <b>African</b> crops (pearl <b>millet,</b> sorghum, baobab and possibly cowpea) were found in association with these finds, indicating that these MIA communities practised a mixed economy of fishing, domestic livestock keeping and agriculture. In addition, the presence of cotton suggests they may have also been producing fibres or textiles, most likely for local use, but possibly also for long distance trade. Although some quartz artefacts were recovered, we found no evidence of any pre-Iron Age LSA culture at the cave, contrary to previous claims about the site...|$|R
40|$|Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. ] was domesticated in Sahelian West Africa. This highly outcrossing crop {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} staple cereals in the semiarid tropics, adapted to very harsh rain-fed conditions. Agro-morphological characterization of local germplasm is very important to better understand existing diversity, ease targeted genetic broadening of breeding populations, and potentially link this knowledge to genotypic information. The objectives of our study were to (i) characterize West and Central <b>African</b> (WCA) pearl <b>millet</b> accessions based on their agro-morphological traits; (ii) evaluate the possibility to group accessions based on their agro-morphological characteristics; (iii) determine geographic patterns of phenotypic differentiation; and (iv) derive conclusions for pearl millet improvement in WCA. A total of 360 early-tomedium maturity accessions were phenotyped for 12 agro-morphological traits at six environments in WCA. Wide ranges of all observed traits indicated a high diversity of the tested accessions. Principal component analysis revealed very large diversity within individual countries, especially within Mali and Burkina Faso. Some limited grouping of accessions from Niger, Senegal, Cameroon, Morocco, and Mauritania was observed for individual principal component axes. Geographical differentiation and country differences were detected for several traits. The results and data presented in our study reflect WCA pearl millets’ tremendous diversity and adaptability to a wide range of environments and give a sound basis for breeders to select and utilize this germplasm to serve the manifold needs of WCA pearl millet farmers...|$|R

The objective of this study to determine the level of improving the nutritive value, removing the antinutrient of millet by solid state fermentation process using Aspergillus niger and effect of the product on the growth performance of <b>African</b> catfish fingerlings. <b>Millet</b> seeds were sterilized for 30 minutes, inoculated with Ammonium sulphate and urea at 10 gNKg- 1 substrate, spores of Aspergillus niger and sulphuric acid to obtain initial pH of 3. 5 - 40. The mixture was fermented for 84 h at 35 0 C and 90 - 95 % RH in the laboratory, then sundried for 48 hrs, five diets(40 % Crude protein) were formulated, containing 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 % inclusion levels of fermented millet. The diets were fed to 225 fingerlings (two week old) weighing 1. 28 + 0. 2, stocked at density of 15 fingerlings per tank in triplicate. Millet protein increased from 10. 9 % to 17. 0 %, phytic acid reduced significantly from 0. 02 mg/ 100 g to 0. 014 mg/ 100 g. fingerlings fed 4 % inclusion has the highest value of Percentage weight gain (PWG) 110. 2 %, Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) 1. 4 and lowest value of Feed conversion ratio (FCR) 1. 8 while fingerlings fed diet containing 8 % and 12 % inclusion levels had the lowest value of PWG 26. 7 %, 37. 5 % and PER 0. 66, 0. 68 respectively with highest FCR 3. 6.

40|$|Starch {{serves as}} {{the main energy source}} in cereal and tuber-rich diets, and its glycemic {{response}} profile has been associated with health-related conditions. Sorghum and millet are known to have relatively low starch digestibility, a potentially desirable property for controlling blood glucose response and providing sustained energy. Gastric emptying rates of traditional sorghum and millet-based African foods of the Sahelian region (couscous, thick and thin porridges made from millet and/or sorghum) were compared to those of non-traditional 2 ̆ 2 modern 2 ̆ 2 foods that are mostly consumed in urban areas using a non-invasive 13 C-labelled octanoic acid breath test in healthy volunteers. The obtained results showed that traditional sorghum and millet-based solid African foods had markedly slower in gastric emptying rate compared to rice, potatoes, and pasta as measured by lag phase and half-emptying time (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Factors that regulate gastric emptying of an ingested food are of interest since their understanding may help in controlling overall energy intake. In a second study, Polycose® solution (rapidly absorbed glucose) and slow digesting, cooked and washed alginate-based waxy starch-entrapped microspheres (of variable digestion rates) were consumed as a preload, followed 20 minutes later by a 13 C-labeled non-nutritive paste mixture. A comparatively fast emptying rate was observed when the paste was consumed alone whereas the slowest digesting starch-entrapped microspheres preload presented the slowest paste emptying rate as measured by the lag phase and the half emptying time parameters of the gastric emptying test (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). ^ Starch is also a dominant source of dietary energy in complimentary feeding of growing toddlers. After weaning, dietary glucose is generated mostly from starch which is the main component of most complementary foods. A new, non-invasive modified 13 C-breath test was used to assess pancreatic 2 ̆ 6 agr;-amylase activity, and the ability to digest sorghum porridge starch in healthy and moderately stunted toddlers from 18 – 30 months of age in Bamako, Mali. 2 ̆ 6 agr;-amylase insufficiency was present in both Malian healthy and stunted toddlers. However, children with 2 ̆ 6 agr;-amylase insufficiency digested, absorbed, and oxidized the released glucose from normal sorghum porridge starch at least as well as, and in some cases even better, than the healthy group, indicating that the 2 ̆ 6 agr;-glucosidases compensate for the 2 ̆ 6 agr;-amylase insufficiency, and particularly well in the stunted group. A thicker porridge and its 2 ̆ 6 agr;-amylase thinned counterpart were also digested well by the stunted group. ^ Overall, this work shows value of traditional <b>African</b> sorghum and <b>millet</b> foods and could lead to increased demand for local foods and, thus, provide better markets for smallholder farmers. The clinical study conducted on toddlers suggests that thick energy dense porridges supply digestible carbohydrates to stunted children, and that pending further study could be considered for supplemental feeding program...|$|R
