25|$|The Brandt Mle CM60A1, {{also known}} as the Brandt HB 60LP, MCB-60 HB, or simply as the Brandt 60mm LP Gun-Mortar, is a 60mm (2.36 in.) gun-mortar. Unlike {{conventional}} infantry mortars, it was not designed to be mounted on a bipod and <b>a</b> <b>baseplate,</b> but rather in the turrets of armoured fighting vehicles. The CM60A1 could be fired at a very low angle of elevation, giving it the dual purpose of direct fire artillery. Its hydraulic recoil mechanism reduces peak loads, allowing it to be mounted in very light armoured cars such as the Panhard AML-60 or wheeled armoured personnel carriers like the Panhard M3.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{technology}} existed, it remained for British designers {{to develop a}} system that could deliver hollow-charge ammunition in a larger size and with a greater range than that possessed by the No. 68. At {{the same time that}} Mohaupt was developing hollow-charge ammunition, Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Blacker of the Royal Artillery was investigating the possibility of developing a lightweight platoon mortar. However, rather than using the conventional system of firing the mortar shell from a barrel fixed to <b>a</b> <b>baseplate,</b> Blacker wanted to use the spigot mortar system. Instead of a barrel, there was a steel rod known as a 'spigot' fixed to <b>a</b> <b>baseplate,</b> and the bomb itself had a propellant charge inside its tail. When the mortar was to be fired, the bomb was pushed down onto the spigot, which exploded the propellant charge and blew the bomb into the air. By effectively putting the barrel {{on the inside of the}} weapon, the barrel diameter was no longer a limitation on the warhead size. Blacker eventually designed a lightweight mortar that he named the 'Arbalest' and submitted it to the War Office, but it was turned down in favour of a Spanish design. Undeterred, however, Blacker continued with his experiments and decided to try to invent a hand-held anti-tank weapon based on the spigot design, but found that the spigot could not generate sufficient velocity needed to penetrate armour. But he did not abandon the design, and eventually come up with the Blacker Bombard, a swivelling spigot-style system that could launch a [...] bomb approximately although the bombs it fired could not actually penetrate armour, they could still severely damage tanks, and in 1940 a large number of Blacker Bombards were issued to the Home Guard as anti-tank weapons.|$|E

50|$|The 4.2-inch Mortar entered {{production}} {{at the end of}} 1941 with <b>a</b> standard <b>baseplate</b> and tripod. The normal detachment was six men and it was transported with ammunition in a 10 cwt trailer, usually towed behind a Loyd Carrier. There was also <b>an</b> auxiliary <b>baseplate</b> that fitted around it, to increase its area for use on softer ground. Later an integrated trailer/baseplate was developed, called the Mk 1 Mobile Baseplate. The wheels, which were on suspension arms, were unlocked and raised for firing; the Mk1/1 had detachable wheels and the barrel with tripod attached, was stowed on top for towing. The mobile baseplate trailer mounting could be brought into action by 2 men. Regarding rate of fire, one source reports a crew putting 23 bombs in the air before the first impacted.|$|R
