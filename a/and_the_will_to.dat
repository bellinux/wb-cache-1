25|$|Kashmiri Shaivism {{describes}} {{freedom as}} svātantrya - {{the freedom to}} create, maintain and destroy the universe pertaining to Śiva himself. It is considered that Śiva, above any restriction or conditioning, creates the universe of his free will as a playful expression of his spirit (lila). Here the kaulas are unlike Advaita and Veda, where there is the conception that maya (cosmic illusion) is superimposed upon the brahman (absolute), inducing a sort of illusory creation. Here, creation is considered real, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>to</b> create is considered free and unfettered. Svatantrya is identical to Ananda (bliss) and vimarśa (reflexive consciousness/auto-consciousness).|$|E
25|$|The Latin Kingdom {{continued}} to exist, theoretically, {{on the island}} of Cyprus. There the Latin kings schemed and planned to recapture the mainland, but in vain. Money, men, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>to</b> do the task were all lacking. One last effort was made by King Peter I in 1365, when he successfully landed in Egypt and sacked Alexandria. Once the city was pillaged, however, the Crusaders returned as speedily as possible to Cyprus to divide their loot. As a crusade, the episode was futile, and this and further coastal raids over the following decades led in 1410–11 to a destructive counter-raid by the Mamelukes; in 1426 Cyprus was forced into Mameluke vassalship with a hefty yearly tribute.|$|E

2500|$|Friedrich Nietzsche {{believed}} {{the search for}} truth, or 'the will to truth', was {{a consequence of the}} will to power of philosophers. He thought that truth should be used as long as it promoted life <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>to</b> power, and he thought untruth was better than truth if it had this life enhancement as a consequence. As he wrote in Beyond Good and Evil, [...] "The falseness of a judgment is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgment... The question is to what extent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-breeding..." [...] (aphorism 4). He proposed the will to power as a truth only because, according to him, it was the most life-affirming and sincere perspective one could have.|$|E

[...] Any man who goes into it must expect anything and take it, but Morse was tackled altogether beyond the pale of pardon, more than once.

[...] However, the beating took a permanent toll on Morse. [...] After the game, The New York Times reported on Morse's retirement from football:"Franklin B. Morse, '95, Princeton's greatest half back, has gone out of training and quit the game. [...] This move was not taken by Morse until it was forced upon him. [...] He has been ill for some time and was really unable to go in the game with Pennsylvania, although he played in that game as long as he could stand on his feet. [...] Since then he has been on the field only a few times, and had to leave the game each time. [...] The whole student body deeply regrets Morse's inability to continue playing." ...|$|E
