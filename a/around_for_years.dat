25|$|Point Break is an American-German-Chinese co-{{production}}. Studio Babelsberg co-produced and oversaw {{production services}} for the film. A script for the remake had been lying <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> {{but it was not}} until Ericson Core pitched his idea to Warner Bros. that the film actually got off the ground. However, Core's idea for the film was significantly different than the script. His concept was much more of a big tentpole movie, with scenes that defy the laws of physics.|$|E
25|$|Chrissie Wellington {{has said}} she has two passions in life: sport and development. In her victory speech at the 2007 Hawaii Ironman, she {{referred}} to her experience teaching at Beaver Country Day School near Boston, where she first noticed the difference that sport can make to children's lives. She also noted, from her experience in Nepal, how sport can bring conflict-affected communities together. In an interview, her coach Brett Sutton said: She has kicked <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> through South East Asia, working for underprivileged people. That's why she was in Nepal. Already this year she has done clinics in Thailand and the Philippines and now sponsors a young Filipino athlete to attend our group for the coach to work some magic. I think her win could be the catalyst for the sport in South East Asia.|$|E
25|$|Chasers heavily utilize still {{photography}} {{since the}} beginning. Videography gained prominence by the 1990s {{into the early}} 2000s but a resurgence of photography occurred {{with the advent of}} affordable and versatile digital SLR (DSLR) cameras. Prior to this, 35 mm SLR print and slide film formats were mostly used, along with some medium format cameras. In the late 2000s, mobile phone 3G data networks became fast enough to allow live streaming video from chasers using webcams. This live imagery is frequently used by the media, as well as NWS meteorologists, emergency managers, and the general public for direct ground truth information, and it provides video sales opportunities to chasers. Also by this time, camcorders using memory cards to record video began to be adopted. Digital video had been <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> but was recorded on tape, whereas solid-state is random access rather than sequential access (linear) and has no moving parts. Late in the 2000s HD video began to overtake SD (which had been NTSC in North America) in usage as prices came down and performance increased (initially there were low-light and sporadic aliasing problems due to chip and sensor limitations). By the mid-2010s 4K cameras were increasingly in use. Tripods are used by those seeking crisp professional photo and video imagery and also enable chasers to tend to other activities.|$|E

500|$|In her 2007 book Naked on the Internet, author Audacia Ray {{wrote of}} the fucking machines: [...] "In the fusion of female {{sexuality}} and technology, the curious and enthralling thing about these toys {{is the way in}} which they cast sexuality and technology together in a near miasma of technophobia and technofetishism." [...] Jon Mooallem of The New York Times Magazine described the website as [...] "dedicated entirely to women having sex with large and distressingly elaborate machines." [...] In an article for Wired News, Regina Lynn noted that the presence of Fucking Machines at the 2007 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo was a move to the mainstream for the website: [...] "The website has been <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> in that grey area of 'indie internet kink' the Industry doesn't quite understand.

500|$|Meanwhile, {{punk rock}} scenes were {{emerging}} around the globe. In France, les punks, a Parisian subculture of Lou Reed fans, {{had already been}} <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> Following the lead of Stinky Toys, Métal Urbain played its first concert in December 1976. In August 1977, Asphalt Jungle played at the second Mont de Marsan punk festival. Stinky Toys' debut single, [...] "Boozy Creed", came out in September. It was perhaps the first non-English-language punk rock record, though as music historian George Gimarc notes, the punk enunciation made that distinction somewhat moot. The following month, Métal Urbain's first 45, [...] "Panik", appeared. After the release of their minimalist punk debut, [...] "Rien à dire", Marie et les Garçons became involved in New York's mutant disco scene. Asphalt Jungle's [...] "Deconnection" [...] and Gasoline's [...] "Killer Man" [...] also came out {{before the end of}} the year, and other French punk acts such as Oberkampf and Starshooter soon formed.|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Davis said {{regarding}} {{the writing of}} the album [...] "Right after we got done touring with Ozzy Osbourne, Ross [...] hooked up with us. We went into a rehearsal studio and started writing. It was faster and thrashier. It was us reacting the vibe that we had to hurry up and get this done. We thought, [...] "Let's do something great, but let's not take a year on it." [...] James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer collaborated [...] "Some of the songs and riffs from the first record had been lingering <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> When it was time to write Life Is Peachy, we went back into the rehearsal studio and we wanted to take the elements that the fans liked and we liked about Korn and elaborate on some of those like Jonathan freaking out. [...] "Twist" [...] came to life. There was that dissonant guitar playing. There was more of a punk rock feel and attitude that the band had. I think a lot of that came from touring so much and the energy of the crowds. We wanted to create a really angry album." ...|$|E
