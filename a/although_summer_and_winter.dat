40|$|The Commonwealth of Massachusetts promulgated an Act {{limiting}} S 2 {{emissions from}} large sources that burn fuel {{at a rate}} {{greater than or equal}} to 100 million Btu (MBtu) of fuel input per hour. The Act requires that by 1995 the average emission rate at such facilities be less than or equal to 1. 2 lb SO 2 per MBtu fuel input. Because of their size, almost all power plants in Massachusetts could be subject to emission reductions. Since the average 1980 - 1982 annual emission rate of Massachusetts power plants was 1. 84 lb S 02 /MBtu ("base case"), the Act requires the annual average emission rate of power plants to diminish by 35 %. We use a source apportionment model to estimate the wet sulfate deposition to typical sensitive Massachusetts receptors from Massachusetts power plants, separately for the summer (April-September) and winter (October-March) half-years. We find that the summer wet deposition is about twice the winter deposition, <b>although</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter</b> SO 2 emissions are approximately equal. Therefore, to reduce sulfate deposition, t is more effective to reduce emissions in the summer months rather than in winter. Using the seasonal source apportionment model we find that an annual wet deposition reduction equal to that resulting from the Act could be accomplished if only summer emission rates were reduced to 0. 86 lb SO /MBtu, with winter emission rates remaining at 1. 84 lb S 02 /MBtu. The resulging annual average emission rate is 1. 35 lb SO /MBtu, 27 % less than the base value. As 1980 - 1982 average annual emissions rom power plants amounted to 270, 000 tons of SO annually, a summer emission control program would save about 21, 000 tons of S emission reduction without sacrificing wet deposition protection. Te summer emission reduction could be acomplished by substituting lower sulfur content fuels, including natural gas, for higher sulfur content fuels.

Collegiate Challenge participants travel to host sites throughout the United States and spend one week working {{in partnership with}} the local Habitat affiliate, the local community, and partner families to help eliminate poverty housing in the area. Host affiliates provide housing for the groups, as well as a place to shower and cook meals for the week. More than 14,000volunteers took part in Collegiate Challenge in 2011, {{making it one of the}} world's largest alternative break programs. Since its inception in 1989, nearly 240,000 students have participated in Collegiate Challenge and have donated more than $25 million to Habitat for Humanity affiliates.|$|R
40|$|The {{distributions}} of Sanderling and Turnstone were determined {{for the south}} side of the Tees Estuary. Location of roosting sites and the movement of the tide were the major factors affecting movement patterns of these two species. The invertebrate species Nerine, Bathyporeia and Eurydice, were observed to comprise virtually all of the Sanderling's open-beach diet. Extensive sampling of these three prey species showed a predictable occurrence along the beach with each species; most common at particular transect and distance below the High Water Mark, (e. g. Nerine was most abundant at 50 to 90 metres below the HWM). The times when these bands became available to 'foraging Sanderling helped to determine the movement patterns of the birds. Detailed studies of the feeding behaviour of Sanderling showed three main foraging techniques: probe feeding, water-column feeding and stitch feeding. The first two of these techniques have a visual component, (the Pause position). Switching occurred between these two techniques but was uncommon between the water column and stitch technique (which was a tactile feeding method). When feeding, Sanderling oriented themselves so that they could watch the progress of the waves. Colour-marked individuals of both Sanderling and Turnstone helped to determine movement, patterns, fidelity to site within a season and survival and fidelity between seasons. Mortality rates for Turnstone were especially low; fidelity was high for both species. Feeding observations on winter Turnstone showed both dispersed and concentrated situations. While aggression was seldom observed for Sanderling, it was common for Turnstone. Two main types of aggressive encounters were observed for the Turnstone and were determined mainly by the potential payoff of the encounter. The suggestion is advanced that aggressive patterns may help determine the dispersion of the Turnstone. Aggression may also help to determine the feeding location of the juveniles. Observations of breeding Turnstone (Finland) present, a picture of communal feeding (aiding in, predator awareness), high; nesting concentrations and numerous, interactions with the lafid species present. The latter include extensile robbing of larid eggs by Turnstone. <b>Although</b> the <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter</b> Turnstone populations have different Wintering grounds, there are valuable comparisons to be mad...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} species composition and abundance of appendicularians {{in the northwestern}} coastal waters of South China Sea based on in situ data obtained by 169 mu m planktonic nets during <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter,</b> <b>and</b> discusses the influence of environmental factors on their distribution and assemblages. A total of 19 appendicularian species (including one unidentified species) was collected. Species richness is higher in <b>summer</b> than in <b>winter,</b> <b>and</b> it increases from inshore to offshore waters. Average abundance of appendicularians is 103. 1 (+/- 198. 1) and 54. 6 (+/- 111. 1) ind. m(- 3) in <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter,</b> respectively. The abundance distribution of appendicularians is generally high around inshore waters during <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter,</b> <b>and</b> with a higher abundance assemblage along the eastern coast from Leizhou Peninsula to Hainan Island, especially at the eastern mouth of Qiongzhou Strait in summer. Oikopleurids accounted for 97. 5 % and 99. 6 % of total appendicularians abundance in <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter,</b> <b>and</b> the region of high values was the same to that of total appendicularians abundance. Oikopleura longicauda, Oikopleura rufescens, and Oikopleura fusiformis are dominant species during <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter.</b> Results showed that spatial distribution of species richness of appendicularians {{is considered to be}} the result of physical factors such as temperature <b>and</b> salinity in <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>winter,</b> while variations in abundance of appendicularians are affected by the combination of physical and biological factors. In particular, variations of appendicularians abundance are affected by food availability in summer. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
