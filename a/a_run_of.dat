5|$|A strong {{start to}} the season saw Arsenal top the league table by September. Defeat against Sevilla in November ended <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> 28 matches undefeated {{and it was not}} until a month after did the team lose in the league for the first time, away at Middlesbrough. Arsenal {{extended}} their league lead to five points in February, but a career-threatening injury to Eduardo against Birmingham City coincided with the team going on <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> four draws in the Premier League. Manchester United soon overtook them in first and defeat to Chelsea in March moved Arsenal down in third place, where they remained {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|For West Indies, Desmond Haynes was unfit, ending <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> 72 {{consecutive}} caps. He {{was replaced}} by the spinner Roger Harper, and Patrick Patterson {{was replaced by}} Winston Benjamin.|$|E
5|$|Hammond's health {{remained}} poor at {{the start}} of the 1935 season. He developed septic tonsillitis which made it difficult for him to breathe, eat and sleep, and ultimately required an operation to remove his tonsils in early 1936. Hammond's form was indifferent and he believed it was his worst season. In first-class matches, he scored 2,616 runs (average 49.35) and took 60 wickets (average 27.26). He became the ninth player to reach 100 first-class centuries, emerging from <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> bad form against Somerset. Long a regular in the side, for the first time he captained the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's. In the five-Test series against South Africa, <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> low scores again brought press speculation about his place in the national side. He did not pass fifty until the third Test, when he scored 63 and 87 not out, ending <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> 22 innings without a fifty, in which time he averaged 23.47 over 14 Tests. Hammond made two more fifties in the last two Tests, although they were insufficient to prevent England from losing 1–0, their third successive series defeat. He finished the series with 389 runs at an average of 64.83, but remained unsatisfied with his form.|$|E
50|$|Production {{examples}} of the Pioneer CC.1 were fitted with full-span controlled leading-edge wing slats and large-area Fowler-type trailing edge flaps, giving <b>a</b> take-off <b>run</b> <b>of</b> 225 feet and <b>a</b> landing <b>run</b> <b>of</b> only 200 feet.|$|R
50|$|The Devolve EP is the 1990 debut release by New Zealand {{rock band}} Shihad. The EP was {{originally}} released in 1990 on <b>a</b> limited <b>run</b> <b>of</b> 1000 vinyl records, and later rereleased as <b>a</b> limited <b>run</b> <b>of</b> CDs.|$|R

5|$|Mills was {{appointed}} manager of Gateshead's National League rivals Wrexham on 28 April 2015 on a one-year rolling contract. On 13 October 2016, Mills was dismissed by Wrexham, after <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> four defeats from six matches left them 15th in the table.|$|E
5|$|After this shaky {{beginning}} in the professional ranks, Gomez had <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> victories from September 1997 to February 1999. During this period Gomez won seven straight fights before challenging for his first title belt, the vacant British Central Area featherweight title against Chris Jickells on 27 February 1999 in Oldham. Gomez won the title with a fifth-round knockout. He followed his first title win by adding another championship, the IBF Inter-Continental featherweight title, with a second-round knockout over Nigel Leake.|$|E
5|$|Barton {{would have}} made his debut for the City first team in November 2002 against Middlesbrough, had he not lost his shirt after leaving it on the {{substitutes}} bench at half-time. He eventually made his first-team debut for the club against Bolton Wanderers on 5 April 2003. His first senior goal came two weeks later in a 2–0 win over Tottenham Hotspur on Good Friday. He ended the 2002–03 season with <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> seven consecutive starts.|$|E
50|$|Two {{releases}} {{were made}} by Ralph America. The original, in 1998, was <b>a</b> limited <b>run</b> <b>of</b> 1200 copies. It was re-released in 2005 in <b>a</b> second <b>run</b> <b>of</b> 1000 copies, with {{a note on the}} inside showing that it was a second pressing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{print edition}} was {{published}} in 2005, in two signed limited editions: one slipcase hardback edition with <b>a</b> print <b>run</b> <b>of</b> 200, and one hardback edition with <b>a</b> print <b>run</b> <b>of</b> 500 books. [...] In 2009, Swanwick posted the stories on a weblog dedicated to the purpose.|$|R

5|$|Before the 2008–09 season, Central Coast was {{predicted}} {{to be among}} the A-League leaders, but had <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> three losses in a row to end the regular season. Even with the losing streak, the club narrowly qualified for the finals, finishing in fourth, two points ahead of Sydney F.C. and Wellington Phoenix. Central Coast lost 4–1 on aggregate in their minor semi-final against Queensland Roar, ending the team's season.|$|E
5|$|Bremner was {{appointed}} manager of struggling Fourth Division side Doncaster Rovers in November 1978. He oversaw a 1–0 win over Rochdale at Belle Vue {{in his first}} match in charge. Results fluctuated during the 1978–79 season, demonstrated by a 7–1 defeat by struggling Bournemouth punctuating <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> five wins in six games. Rovers ended the season in 22nd place, though 11 points ahead of Halifax Town and Crewe Alexandra, and successfully applied to the Football League for re-election.|$|E
5|$|Challinor {{returned}} to Conference Premier club Rushden & Diamonds after signing a two-year contract on 28 May 2007. He made his debut in a 1–1 draw away to Woking on 11 August 2007, before scoring his first goal in a 1–1 draw away to Salisbury City on 8 September. He started the season playing in midfield, but when being played as a striker in late February 2008 {{he went on}} <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> scoring six goals in five consecutive matches.|$|E

5|$|Chambers {{began his}} 2013 {{season with a}} 60m win in Glasgow with <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> 6.58 seconds. A back injury {{affected}} his preparations for the 2013 European Indoor Championships, where he was eliminated in the heats. Outdoors, he won his fourth consecutive British Championship title, running 10.04. A month later at the World Championships in Moscow, he ran 10.14 in his heat to reach the semi-finals, where he was eliminated running 10.15.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{made his}} Test match {{debut in the}} First Test against Pakistan at the Gabba in Brisbane in November 1999 {{becoming}} the 381st Australian Test cricketer. He replaced Healy, who was dropped after <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> poor form, despite the incumbent's entreaties to the selectors to allow him a farewell game {{in front of his}} home crowd. Gilchrist's entry into the Test arena coincided with a dramatic rise in Australia's fortunes. Up to this point, they had played eight Tests in 1999, winning and losing three.|$|E
5|$|He {{introduced}} massages {{and changed}} the canteen and team kit for the 1979–80 campaign. With no money available for transfers {{he was forced to}} turn to the youth team for new players, though he could afford to take on Ian Nimmo, Hugh Dowd, John Dowie and Billy Russell on free transfers. He appointed former Leeds coach Les Cocker as his assistant. The season started poorly, but the squad bonded following Cocker's death on 4 October and went on <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> six straight wins, for which Bremner was credited with the Fourth Division Manager of the Month award. However <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> just one win in 15 games followed, for which Bremner blamed his small squad and lack of training facilities. A mounting injury crisis caused him to make a return to playing on 29 March for the visit of Bournemouth, a game in which 16-year-old Ian Snodin was named on the bench. Rovers ended the season in 12th place.|$|E

5|$|His {{first season}} with Blackburn was mixed – he missed half of it through injury after {{snapping}} his right anterior cruciate ligament in a match against Leeds United in December 1992, but scored a prolific 16 goals in the 21 games in which he did feature. Shearer also became a regular in the England team this season and scored his second international goal; it came in a 4–0 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier win over Turkey in November. The season ended sourly, however, as Shearer was forced to miss January through to May due to injury and England's World Cup qualification chances were hit by <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> poor form.|$|E
5|$|However, {{he broke}} the same finger again and missed the First Test, ending <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> 48 {{consecutive}} Test matches. He returned for the remaining Tests and scored 68 in the Third Test to help to force a draw, after Australia had conceded a 221-run first innings lead, but apart from {{that he had a}} disappointing series, failing to pass 25 and finishing with 131 runs at 21.83.|$|E
5|$|In April, Ødegaard {{was dropped}} from Castilla after <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> four defeats, with staff finding {{problems}} with him training {{with the first}} team while playing for the reserves, {{in addition to a}} language barrier. First team manager Carlo Ancelotti called for fans to be patient while Ødegaard settles in a new country. On 29 April, he was included in Real Madrid's matchday squad for the first time for a home La Liga fixture against UD Almería, as Ancelotti was without Gareth Bale, Luka Modrić and Karim Benzema through injury. However, he did not feature in the 3–0 victory.|$|E

5|$|In August 2010, Wenger {{signed a}} further three-year {{contract}} {{to continue his}} managerial career at Arsenal. His team were on course for a quadruple trophy haul in 2010–11, before defeat to Birmingham City in the 2011 Football League Cup Final, when a mix-up between goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny and defender Laurent Koscielny allowed Obafemi Martins to score the winning goal. This was followed by <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> just two wins in 11 Premier League games, to take them from title contenders to a fourth-place finish. Arsenal then made exits in the FA Cup and the Champions League to Manchester United and Barcelona, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In March 1989, he {{was sold}} to Hull City for £200,000 (at the time a Hull record). This move reunited him with manager Eddie Gray. Leeds spent the money they {{received}} {{from the sale of}} Swan on bringing Gordon Strachan in from Manchester United. Leeds would go on to win the league title in 1991–92 under Wilkinson, with Strachan playing a large part in the success. However Swan and Hull did not find success; Gray used Swan in defence, and lost his job in the summer following <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> just one win in twelve games.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, Bruce {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} extension. <b>A</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> poor form left Hull {{near the bottom of}} the table going into the final game of the 2014–15 season and needing to defeat Bruce's former club Manchester United to stand any chance of avoiding relegation. They could only manage a 0–0 draw and were relegated to the Championship. The poor performances of a number of players signed by Bruce, including club record signing Abel Hernández, were identified as key factors in the club's failure to remain in the Premier League.|$|E
