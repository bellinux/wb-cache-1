5|$|After {{three days}} and nights of this battle, C Company of the 35th Infantry and A Company of the 29th Infantry moved up astride the Komam-ni road during the morning of August 20 to bolster A and B Companies on Sibidang. A large {{concentration}} of North Koreans advanced to renew the attack. The US troops directed <b>artillery</b> <b>fire</b> on this force and called in an air strike. Observers estimated that the <b>artillery</b> <b>fire</b> and the air strike killed about 350 North Korean troops, half the attack group.|$|E
5|$|German {{infantry}} {{were spotted}} advancing towards the brigade box and were bombarded by heavy artillery, which repulsed the attack. Around 09:00, more infantry attacked {{the box and}} came too close for <b>artillery</b> <b>fire.</b> Hand-to-hand fighting began and a British platoon was overrun before a tank-infantry counter-attack repulsed the German infantry and restored the position. The Germans resorted to harassing fire, sniping, mortar bombardments and heavy <b>artillery</b> <b>fire.</b> After a long artillery bombardment, simultaneous attacks by tanks and infantry were made at 19:00, {{from the north and}} south, which broke into the box and closed on the brigade headquarters, before being driven back around 22:30.|$|E
50|$|The defense fired 122 barrages. The light AA <b>artillery</b> <b>fired</b> 2,745 {{shots and}} the heavy AA <b>artillery</b> <b>fired</b> 7,719 shots. The Finnish Air Force had no night fighters at this time.|$|R

5|$|Shortly after this, however, Chinese infiltrators began {{appearing}} {{regularly in the}} undermanned 2nd Company's area, and by 15 May, Queen discovered the Chinese were moving in force to Hill 581, several miles from their position, from which the Chinese could fortify and attack Hill 258. Queen led the platoon on a sneak attack of the Chinese force on 17 May, covered by 7th Division <b>artillery</b> <b>fire.</b> At 15:00, they engaged the surprised Chinese, conducting a double envelopment supported by continued <b>artillery</b> <b>fire.</b> By 17:00, the Rangers secured Hill 581 from the Chinese, who suffered 50 killed and 90 wounded in the attack.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there had}} been plenty of {{fighting}}, the main Japanese force on Manus had not been located. Advancing inland towards Rossum, the 7thCavalry found it on 20March. Six days of fighting around Rossum were required before the 7th and 8thCavalry reduced the entrenched Japanese positions there. The Japanese bunkers, actually log and earth pillboxes, proved resistant to <b>artillery</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|Colonel England's 2/3rd Infantry Battalion was {{supported}} by the guns of the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery and a troop of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment. The tanks were late in arriving, and England postponed his attack to 1030. The battalion came under <b>artillery</b> <b>fire,</b> mostly from a battery north of Bardia that was then engaged and silenced by the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. The advance resumed, only to come under machine gun and <b>artillery</b> <b>fire</b> from Wadi el Gerfan. An eight-man section under Lance Corporal F. W. Squires was sent to reconnoitre the wadi but attacked a battery position instead and returned with 500 prisoners. The wadi was found to contain large numbers of Italian soldiers from technical units who, untrained for combat, surrendered in large numbers. One company captured over 2,000 prisoners, including 60 officers.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the renewed NVA <b>artillery</b> <b>fire,</b> on 30 May, 4 M107s and 4 M110s were deployed to KSCB from Camp Carroll and these engaged in a 48-hour artillery barrage named Operation Drumfire II against suspected NVA artillery positions in the Co Roc Range, with little noticeable effect.|$|E
5|$|In spiking {{the guns}} at the Red House battery, the Americans had {{accomplished}} {{the more important}} of their two objectives: an invading force could now land between Chippawa and Fort Erie without facing <b>artillery</b> <b>fire.</b> However, subsequent events would render their service useless.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November, the {{combined}} Yugoslav force sailed through the Korčula Channela strait separating {{the islands of}} Hvar and Korčulato reach safety at the Yugoslav Navy base at Vis. The warships were then engaged by Croatian coastal artillery deployed on Korčula and the Pelješac Peninsula, losing two minesweepers to the <b>artillery</b> <b>fire</b> in the process.|$|E

5|$|On the Confederate {{right flank}} {{a total of}} six {{batteries}} engaged the Federals, but they did so one-by-one instead of in unison, and each was consecutively cut to pieces by concentrated Union <b>artillery</b> <b>fire.</b> Moreover, they engaged the Union artillery later than the guns of the left flank, so the desired crossfire bombardment was never achieved.|$|E
5|$|That morning, Azmy's paratroopers moved {{south to}} their objectives, {{reaching}} them with relative ease. The 89th Battalion occupied all five strong points between Jebel Mariam and the pumping station. The commander {{made the mistake}} of separating his forces equally among all five strong points, rather than concentrating his forces at the southernmost strong points. However, from the rampart at the pumping station, the paratroopers could clearly see the Israeli pontoon bridge at Deversoir, and corrected <b>artillery</b> <b>fire</b> being directed against the bridge. Second Army's artillery forces continued to fire almost unceasingly until the following day, sometimes scoring hits on the bridge. Egyptian <b>artillery</b> <b>fire</b> against the bridges would inflict heavy casualties on the Israelis {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The 18th Armoured Regiment disembarked at Taranto on 22 October 1943 and {{gradually}} travelled north towards the Sangro River, which it duly crossed on 3 December. The advance had been slow due to mine fields and delaying ambushes by the Germans. Pleasants, the regiment's commanding officer, was slightly wounded by <b>artillery</b> <b>fire</b> and Major Hugh Green briefly took over. He was mortally wounded by <b>artillery</b> <b>fire</b> on 3 December {{at the village}} of Melone, {{to the north of}} the Sangro River. Two days later the regiment, with Pleasants back in command, mounted an attack on the German positions at Melone but this failed and seven tanks became stuck. The crews remained with the tanks until they were recovered at the beginning of 1944.|$|E

5|$|The <b>artillery</b> <b>fire</b> {{progressively}} intensified until 23 June, {{while the}} RSK mobilised and counterattacked against the HV {{positions at the}} Miljevci Plateau. However, the mobilisation yielded only 227 additional troops, and the counterattack failed. An UNPROFOR assessment concluded the situation might deteriorate further and engulf all of the pink zones. To address the situation, UNPROFOR military commander Lieutenant General Satish Nambiar met with Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia Milan Ramljak and Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia General Anton Tus in Zagreb the same day, {{in order to discuss}} the developments on the Miljevci Plateau. Skirmishes continued on 24 June, accompanied by some <b>artillery</b> <b>fire.</b> Morale of the RSK troops plummeted though, causing a TO garrison based in nearby Trbounj to abandon its barracks.|$|E
5|$|The beaches {{themselves}} were overlooked by pillboxes of various types. These were sometimes placed low {{down to get}} maximum advantage from enfilading fire whereas others were placed high up making them much harder to capture. Searchlights were installed at the coast to illuminate the sea surface and the beaches for <b>artillery</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|The land walls {{stretch from}} Fort Bokar {{in the west}} to the {{detached}} Revelin Fortress in the east. On the landside, the wall is protected with an additional range of slanted supporting walls as defense against <b>artillery</b> <b>fire,</b> especially against possible Ottoman attacks.|$|E

50|$|Indirect fire, {{the firing}} of a {{projectile}} without relying on direct line of sight between the gun and the target, possibly {{dates back to the}} 16th century. Early battlefield use of indirect fire may have occurred at Paltzig in July 1759, when the Russian <b>artillery</b> <b>fired</b> over the tops of trees, and at the Battle of Waterloo, where a battery of the Royal Horse <b>Artillery</b> <b>fired</b> Shrapnel indirectly against advancing French troops.|$|R
5|$|The {{next morning}} five North Korean T-34 tanks crossed {{the river and}} moved toward Hamch'ang. <b>Artillery</b> <b>fire</b> from A Battery of the 90th Field Artillery Battalion knocked out four of the tanks immediately. The fifth moved back across the river, where an air strike later {{destroyed}} it.|$|E
5|$|These {{advances}} {{took place}} under Swedish <b>artillery</b> <b>fire.</b> From 21 March until 29 March (when, according to Aleksander Myshlayevsky, the Russians began firing their artillery), 66 bombs and 1,200 round shots were released by Swedish artillery. Also, the Swedes attempted a ground assault, but were driven {{back into the}} fort.|$|E
5|$|A replica wooden bridge {{runs from}} the outer defences over the water to an island called a ravelin, which is in turn linked to the inner defences by another replica bridge, {{protected}} with two drawbridges. The ravelin formed a physical barrier to incoming <b>artillery</b> <b>fire</b> aimed {{at the entrance to}} the inner defences and could also have directed fire against enemy forces that breached the outer defensive line.|$|E
