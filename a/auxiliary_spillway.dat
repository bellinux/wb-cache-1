25|$|A {{spillway}} is {{a section}} of a dam designed to pass water from the upstream side of a dam to the downstream side. Many spillways have floodgates designed to control the flow through the spillway. There are several types of spillway. A service spillway or primary spillway passes normal flow. An <b>auxiliary</b> <b>spillway</b> releases flow {{in excess of the}} capacity of the service spillway. An emergency spillway is designed for extreme conditions, such as a serious malfunction of the service spillway. A fuse plug spillway is a low embankment designed to be overtopped and washed away {{in the event of a}} large flood. The elements of a fuse plug are independent free-standing blocks, set side by side which work without any remote control. They allow increasing the normal pool of the dam without compromising the security of the dam because they are designed to be gradually evacuated for exceptional events. They work as fixed weirs at times by allowing over-flow for common floods.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{possibilities}} of numerical modelling of an overflow over selected types of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>spillways</b> {{and then the}} possibilities are verified in particular localities. In thesis, there is carried out the determination of capacity of selected spillways by using several methods: the calculation of the overflow equation, one-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical models and physical model. The author created parametric analysis to each single method. Parametric analysis represent various hydraulic conditions. Subsequently, there is possible to express the effect of parametric analysis. The author makes a comparison of water levels received by mentioned methods set out under the specific hydraulic conditions by calibration of each model with the physical model. Finally, author recommends values of all coefficients which {{have an impact on}} results of numerical modelling of the flow over selected types of weirs mostly using like <b>auxiliary</b> <b>spillways...</b>|$|R

50|$|In an {{intermediate}} type, normal level {{regulation of the}} reservoir {{is controlled by the}} mechanical gates. If inflow to the reservoir exceeds the gate's capacity, an artificial channel called either an <b>auxiliary</b> or emergency <b>spillway</b> that is blocked by a fuse plug dike will operate. The fuse plug is designed to over-top and wash out in case of a large flood, greater than the discharge capacity of the spillway gates. Although it may take many months to restore the fuse plug and channel after such an operation, the total damage and cost to repair is less than if the main water-retaining structures had been overtopped. The fuse plug concept is used where it would be very costly to build a spillway with capacity for the probable maximum flood.|$|R
40|$|The box inlet drop {{spillway}} {{is defined as}} a rectangular box open at the top and at the downstream end. The spillway is shown in Figure 1. Storm runoff is directed to the box by dikes and headwalls, enters over the upstream end and two sides, and leaves through the open downstream end. An outlet structure is attached to the downstream end of the box. The long crest of the box inlet permits large flows to pass over it with relatively low heads, yet the width of the spillway need be no greater than that of the exit channel. the {{drop spillway}} has been extensively used as a gully control structure where it is necessary to drop water from as short a distance as 2 feet to as much as 12 feet. In more recent years it has also been used in drainage ditches where it functions as a title outlet and means of dropping excess surface water into the ditch. For the sake of economy, <b>auxiliary</b> vegetated <b>spillways</b> are sometimes provided to pass part of the runoff from the larger storms and to permit the use of smaller mechanical spillway. In order to prevent scour of the drainage ditch banks the elevations of the vegetated spillways are adjusted so no water will pass over them until the downstream drainage ditch flows back full. In other words, the mechanical spillway must have sufficient capacity to fill the ditch completely before any flow passes over the vegetated spillway. Under these conditions the high downstream water level will likely submerge the spillway and reduce its flow. After the vegetated spillways come into operation, the downstream level rises still further and submergence of the mechanical spillway becomes greater. Spillways designed in this manner are known as the "island dam" type because they can be completely surrounded by water during flood periods. The necessity for these studies to determine the capacity of box inlet drop spillways under submerged flow conditions thus becomes apparent...|$|R

The dam was completed in 1972, and the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>spillway</b> in December 1974. The dam was later raised to accommodate an improved intake and an additional 2.4 m in water elevation.

40|$|The nature-like fishway has {{attracted}} attention as a fish passage solution {{that allows a}} dam to remain in place while providing passage to {{a wider variety of}} fish species and life stages as compared to traditional technical fishway options. Nature-like fishways provide additional instream habitat and are more riverine in appearance than technical fishways, allowing the fishway to be incorporated into attractive park-like settings. By providing more diverse fish passage, better instream habitat, and improved aesthetics over technical fishways, the nature-like fishway is an appealing option for the establishment of fish passage at dams with a low likelihood of removal. Although bypass channels, a type of nature-like fishway, have gained acceptance in Europe, they are still a relatively new idea in the United States. The aim of this discussion will be to further introduce the nature-like fishway and to present a design protocol based on projects here in the United States. For a nature-like fishway to be passable, the velocity, cover, and depth of flow must be scaled to the swimming and biological characteristics of one or more fish species. A design protocol, drawing upon examples of nature-like fishways constructed by Milone 2 ̆ 6 MacBroom, Inc. (MMI), is presented. These examples include a fishway at the Grangebel Park Dam, a long, low structure located at the upstream limit of tidewater on the Peconic River. The dam consists of an earth embankment, a principal (north) <b>spillway,</b> and an <b>auxiliary</b> (south) <b>spillway</b> with a raceway channel. An Alaskan Steep Pass type of fishladder was seasonally placed in the north spillway channel. The Town of Riverhead, New York and the watershed association identified the south spillway as a location for a more permanent, attractive, lower maintenance facility for the passage of alewife and American eel. During its three years of operation, the nature-like fishway has proven to be very successful. This design protocol will also include a nature-like fishway that is under design on the Swan River in Brookhaven, NY and one that will be under construction on the Naugatuck River in Seymour, CT...|$|R

50|$|Because {{of safety}} concerns, the dam was later {{modified}} during the mid-1990s by the Bureau of Reclamation. Beginning in March 1994, the dam was raised 21.5 ft and subsequently, its service spillway was modified {{as well to}} accompany the new height. An unlined <b>auxiliary</b> <b>spillway</b> was also constructed about 1500 ft south of the dam's left abutment.

Because of later development downstream, the dam was reclassified as high hazard in 2006.
