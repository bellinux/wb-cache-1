5000|$|This study {{consisted}} of 572 {{men and women who}} agreed to fill out a questionnaire that measured conflict over anger expression. The premise of the experiment was to see if [...] "pent up anger" [...] and the inability to express one self has an effect on health and blood pressure. In the past, {{it has been shown that}} hypertension is most prevalent in lower social classes and among those experiencing a high degree of social disruption. Their systolic blood pressures were then record and conclusions were drawn about suppressed anger and its relationship to blood pressure. Across all of the subjects, blood pressure was significantly related to suppressed anger. After the researchers controlled age, social class, and obesity, the relationship remained. The relationship between suppressed anger and gender then varied. There was a significant relationship for white men, a trend shown for black men, and no significance between the two in women. The study took place at an unemployment office, and was set up to offer free blood pressure screenings. The participants were then briefly seated, and asked to fill out a questionnaire that asked about certain demographic and health information. They were then asked about a hypothetical situation in which they had to decide how they would deal with anger they felt, either by holding it in or expressing it outwardly. A three-point scale was then determined for the ability to express anger, and these scores were compared to the blood pressure results. In <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>analyses,</b> diastolic pressure was not related to suppressed anger. Systolic blood pressure, however, was found to be significantly related to suppressed anger, even after controlling for age, social class, and obesity.|$|E

However, for the characteristic frequencies between proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules to be compared, it is required to make adjustments for the differences in distances between nucleotides (3.4  Å) and amino acids (3.8  Å).

(Tartary buckwheat) morphogenic and non-morphogenic callus {{lines are}} interesting systems for gaining {{a better understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanisms {{that are responsible for}} the genetic stability and instability of a plant tissue culture. In this work, we used histological sections and transmission electron microscopy to identify and describe <b>the</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nuclei <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> callus lines. We demonstrated that the embryogenic callus cells had prominent round nuclei that did not contain heterochromatin clumps in contrast to the non-morphogenic callus lines, in which we found nuclei that had multiple lobes. Flow cytometry analysis revealed significant differences in the relative DNA content between <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> calli. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> morphogenic callus lines had peaks from 2 C to 8 C as compared to the non-morphogenic callus lines, whose peaks did not reflect any regular DNA content and exceeded 8 C and 16 C for the line 6 p 1 and 16 C and 32 C for the callus line 10 p 2 A. The results showed that non-morphogenic calli are of an aneuploid nature. The TUNEL test enabled us to visualise the nuclei that had DNA fragmentation in both the morphogenic and non-morphogenic lines. We revealed significantly higher frequencies of positively labelled nuclei in the non-morphogenic lines than in the morphogenic lines.
