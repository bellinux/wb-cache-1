25|$|<b>As</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> in bicycle racing, the countersteering {{becomes evident}} {{when there is}} an {{obstacle}} preventing the wheel from countersteering (e.g., when closely overlapping wheels or riding very close to a curb). In these situations, the way to initiate a turn with the handlebars away from the obstacle is to countersteer towards obstacle to avoid crashing into it. Lack of understanding of this principle leads to accidents in novice bicycle races.|$|E
25|$|Fibred {{category}} admitting no splitting: A group G can {{be considered}} as a category with one object and the elements of G as the morphisms, composition of morphisms being given by the group law. A group homomorphism f: G → H can then be considered as a functor, which makes G into a H-category. It can be checked that in this set-up all morphisms in G are cartesian; hence G is fibred over H precisely when f is surjective. A splitting in this setup is a (set-theoretic) section of f which commutes strictly with composition, or in other words a section of f which is also a homomorphism. But <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> in group theory, this is not always possible (one can take the projection in a non-split group extension).|$|E

For armament, she carried 12 guns. She was also fitted with an iron ram. On March 8, 1862, she {{attacked}} the Union fleet enforcing the blockade at Hampton Roads, on the James River near Norfolk. She sank two major Union warships ( [...] and [...] ), and menaced a third (...) , which had grounded {{in the attempt to}} get into action. The damages she suffered were negligible. In that first day of the battle, she had demonstrated the basic validity of Mallory's belief that armored warships could destroy the best wooden ships and were almost impervious to damage in return. <b>As</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known,</b> when Virginia returned to battle the next day intending to finish off [...] Minnesota, she encountered the Union's [...] The two armored vessels fought inconclusively, demonstrating the flaw in Mallory's argument: an ultimate weapon is truly decisive only if one side does not have it.|$|E

[...] "It is true that while Muslim families, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known,</b> continue to make a lot of children, Christian ones on the contrary tend to have fewer and fewer," [...] the monsignor said.

2500|$|Resurgent Islam {{is one of}} {{the most}} dynamic {{religious}} movements in the contemporary world. The Vatican's newly-released 2008 yearbook of statistics revealed that for the first time, Islam has outnumbered the Roman Catholics globally. It stated that, [...] "Islam has overtaken Roman Catholicism as the biggest single religious denomination in the world", and stated that, [...] "It is true that while Muslim families, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known,</b> continue to make a lot of children, Christian ones on the contrary tend to have fewer and fewer". According to the Foreign Policy, High birth rates were cited as the reason for the Muslim population growth. With 3.1 children per woman, Muslims have higher fertility levels than the world’s overall population between 2010 and 2015. High fertility is a major driver of projected Muslim population growth around the world and in particular regions. Between 2010-2015, with exception of the Middle East and North Africa, Muslim fertility of any other region in the world was higher than the rate for the region as a whole. While Muslim birth rates are expected to experience a decline, it will remain above replacement level and higher fertility than the world’s overall by 2050.
