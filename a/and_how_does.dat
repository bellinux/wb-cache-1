5|$|Other {{issues in}} {{philosophy}} of psychology are philosophical {{questions about the}} nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy of mind. For example, are humans rational creatures? Is there any sense in which they have free will, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>does</b> that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and artificial intelligence, questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.|$|E
25|$|The project {{inspired}} and {{paved the way}} for genomic work in other fields, such as agriculture. For example, by studying the genetic composition of Tritium aestivum, the world’s most commonly used bread wheat, great insight has been gained into the ways that domestication has impacted the evolution of the plant. Which loci are most susceptible to manipulation, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>does</b> this play out in evolutionary terms? Genetic sequencing has allowed these questions to be addressed for the first time, as specific loci can be compared in wild and domesticated strains of the plant. This will allow for advances in genetic modification in the future which could yield healthier, more disease-resistant wheat crops.|$|E
500|$|Philosophy of {{mathematics}} {{is concerned with}} the philosophical foundations and implications {{of mathematics}}. The central questions are whether numbers, triangles, and other mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind and {{what is the nature of}} mathematical propositions. Is asking whether [...] "1+1=2" [...] is true fundamentally different from asking whether a ball is red? Was calculus invented or discovered? A related question is whether learning mathematics requires experience or reason alone. What does it mean to prove a mathematical theorem <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>does</b> one know whether a mathematical proof is correct? Philosophers of mathematics also aim to clarify the relationships between mathematics and logic, human capabilities such as intuition, and the material universe.|$|E

[...] Kirkus Reviews praised the book, writing, [...] "while making no attempt at depth of characterization, Whitehead audaciously blurs the line between social realism and fabulist satire." [...] The Library Journal praised the book, noting, [...] "in spare and evocative prose, Whitehead does Shakespeare one better: What's in a name, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>does</b> our identity relate to our own sense of who we are?" [...] The New York Observer was critical of the book but noted, [...] "readers not looking for direct emotional access to the characters may find it gratifying to solve the intellectual puzzle set here by Colson Whitehead." ...|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{electrification}} systems take AC {{energy from}} a power grid which is delivered to a locomotive and {{converted to a}} DC voltage {{to be used by}} traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors which require further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. Where should this conversion take place and at what voltage and current (AC or DC) should the power flow to the locomotive? [...] <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>does</b> all this relate to energy-efficiency? [...] Both the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors). [...] Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. [...] Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for.|$|E
