5|$|On another {{occasion}} during the war, when {{the lady in}} waiting who usually picked them up from the hospital was detained and sent a carriage without an attendant, Tatiana and her sister Olga decided to go shopping for the first time. They ordered the carriage to stop near a group of shops and went {{into one of the}} stores, where they were unrecognized because of their nurses' uniforms. They came back out without buying <b>anything</b> <b>when</b> they realized they did not have money with them and wouldn't have known how to use it even if they did. The next day they asked Chebotareva how to use money.|$|E
5|$|This {{leads the}} {{brothers}} to the riverside Sunrise Apartments in Jefferson City, Missouri. The boys manage to overpower the demons guarding John, and rescue him. However, they are attacked by Meg's demonic brother Tom, and Dean {{is forced to}} kill him {{with one of the}} three remaining bullets of the Colta mystical gun capable of killing <b>anything.</b> <b>When</b> the Winchesters later find refuge in a secluded cabin, Azazel reveals himself to be possessing John. Dean, while being tortured by the demon, begs his father to break free and save him. John is able to temporarily gain control, and then begs Sam to use the Colt to kill Azazel. Unable to bring himself to kill his father, Sam instead shoots him in the leg, causing Azazel to flee to safety. The Winchesters rush towards the hospital, but their car is rammed into by a semi-trailer truck being driven by a demonically-possessed truck driver.|$|E
25|$|When {{the team}} visited {{the school in}} April they found it empty, to their delight. However, this was only because the {{students}} were on Easter holidays and soon returned. H. Gaunt, the headmaster, {{was concerned about the}} mysterious arrival of numerous government inspectors on 25 April, who left without telling them <b>anything.</b> <b>When</b> he contacted the Ministry of Works and Planning he was informed that a government department would be moving into the school, forcing him to move the students {{for the second time in}} two years.|$|E

25|$|Lü Meng {{rejected}} the coins and gold, but Sun Quan {{insisted that he}} accept. He became ill again before he was enfeoffed as a marquis. Sun Quan was at Gong'an County then so he had Lü Meng brought to his personal residence to stay with him. He also offered 1,000 jin of gold as a reward to any person who could cure Lü Meng. Sun Quan became more worried as Lü Meng's condition deteriorated over time. He wanted to see Lü Meng but {{felt that it was}} too troublesome to keep moving around, so he had a hole drilled in the wall to observe Lü Meng's room. He was happy when he saw Lü Meng having his meals, but could not sleep at night when he saw that Lü Meng did not eat <b>anything.</b> <b>When</b> Lü Meng's condition improved slightly, he was so happy that he ordered his subjects to visit Lü Meng and wish him well. He even invited Taoist priests to perform rituals to increase Lü Meng's lifespan. Despite Sun Quan's efforts, Lü Meng eventually died in Gong'an County at the age of 42 (by East Asian age reckoning). Sun Quan was extremely grieved by Lü Meng's death. Before Lü Meng died, he had instructed his family to store all their priced possessions – including gifts from Sun Quan – in a vault and return them to his lord after his death. He had also asked for a simple funeral. Sun Quan felt even more sad when found out that Lü Meng had made such arrangements before his death.|$|E

500|$|Thanks to {{developments}} in technology {{over the past}} few decades, consciousness has become a significant topic of interdisciplinary research in cognitive science, with significant contributions from fields such as psychology, anthropology, neuropsychology and neuroscience. The primary focus is on understanding what it means biologically and psychologically for information to be present in consciousness—that is, on determining the neural and psychological correlates of consciousness. [...] The majority of experimental studies assess consciousness in humans by asking subjects for a verbal report of their experiences (e.g., [...] "tell me if you notice <b>anything</b> <b>when</b> I do this"). [...] Issues of interest include phenomena such as subliminal perception, blindsight, denial of impairment, and altered states of consciousness produced by alcohol and other drugs, or spiritual or meditative techniques.|$|E
500|$|Zero {{was created}} by {{designer}} Keiji Inafune when {{he was told to}} recreate Mega Man for a new series on the Super Nintendo, Mega Man X. He wanted to design a Mega Man different from the original one. However, Inafune realized afterwards that the character he created was too different from Mega Man's old appearance to be viewed positively by fans. Deciding to let another designer work on the character that eventually became Mega Man X while he developed Zero, Inafune created the character intending him to be [...] "the 'other main character' that would [...] "steal all the good scenes". He further described Zero as representing the idea that [...] "nothing is absolute", and circumstances can change <b>anything.</b> <b>When</b> asked if Zero had killed the cast of the original Mega Man titles, suspected due to their absence in the X series, he replied no, adding that given how he had designed the character, [...] "Zero is not such a person--it is not in his profile." ...|$|E
500|$|The Soviet Union made {{substantial}} use {{of deception}} while preparing for their military intervention of Czechoslovakia in 1968. The historian Mark Lloyd called {{the effect on}} the Prague Spring [...] "devastating". When the Kremlin had failed to reverse the Czech leader Alexander Dubcek's liberal reforms with threats, it decided to use force, masked by deception. The measures taken included transferring fuel and ammunition out of Czechoslovakia on a supposed logistics exercise; and confining most of their soldiers to barracks across the northern Warsaw Pact area. The Czech authorities thus did not suspect <b>anything</b> <b>when</b> two Aeroflot airliners made unscheduled landings at night, full of [...] "fit young men". The men cleared customs and travelled to the Soviet Embassy in the centre of Prague. There they picked up weapons and returned to the airport, taking over the main buildings. They at once allowed further aircraft to land uniformed Spetsnaz and airborne troops, who took over key buildings across Prague before dawn. Reinforcements were then brought in by road, in complete radio silence, leaving NATO Electronic Warfare units [...] "confused and frustrated".|$|E

500|$|Crash Nitro Kart is {{a racing}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} characters from the Crash Bandicoot universe, most of whom race in karts. While racing, the player can accelerate, steer, reverse, brake, hop or use weapons and power-ups with the game controller's analog stick and buttons. Four distinct types of crates are scattered throughout the tracks and arenas of Crash Nitro Kart. [...] "Item Crates" [...] are marked with a question mark (?) and usually come in sets of four. The player can obtain a weapon or power-up by driving through an Item Crate and breaking it apart. The player can only carry one weapon or power-up at a time. [...] "Multiplier Crates" [...] are marked with an [...] "X" [...] and are usually found in hard-to-reach spots on the tracks. These special crates contain three of a certain weapon or power-up. [...] "Wumpa Crates" [...] are unmarked and carry [...] "Wumpa Fruit" [...] that strengthens the player's weapons and power-ups if ten of them are obtained. [...] "Activation Crates" [...] are marked with an exclamation point (!) and don't give the player <b>anything</b> <b>when</b> they are driven through; instead, they activate either a trap that can slow down the other racers or a boost pad.|$|E
