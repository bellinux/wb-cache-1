500|$|Anthony Horowitz, the {{original}} writer of Midsomer Murders, borrowed {{part of the}} name of the town when he adapted Caroline Graham’s Chief Inspector Barnaby series for television in 1997. [...] Although the series itself is primarily filmed in picturesque villages in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, Horowitz chose the name after looking <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> of Somerset, believing that it sounded quintessentially English. Although no filming of the show has ever taken place in Midsomer Norton or the surrounding parishes, some names of other nearby locations have been used by the producers in creating their fictional county of Midsomer, including Midsomer Wellow (Wellow), Midsomer Magna (Chew Magna), Midsomer Morton and the main settlement of Causton (Corston). Despite some occasional confusion, there is no other link between Midsomer Norton and the television series.|$|E
500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, I remember saying, [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. What could it be?" [...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If you take a look <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{criticized the}} {{character}} development of Lori Grimes. Goldman was angry upon viewing the crash sequence, avouching that it stunted any development {{intended for the}} scene. He stated, [...] "The Walking Dead really needs to work on strengthening its female characters, and it doesn't help when Lori has a major accident for such a stupid reason, getting distracted as she looked <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> while she drove. Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, {{but it could have}} been an animal [...] just as easily, and it really undercut the intended drama of her situation when it just seems so stupid that it happened at all." [...] Halden thought that the foundation set up for furthering storyline progression was contrived, while Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal said that the premise of the dilemma made no sense. Jeffery was much more optimistic about the scene, ultimately evaluating it as a [...] "jaw-dropping moment".|$|E

Looking <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> of the area, Navarre chose the small town of Điện Biên Phủ, located about [...] north of the Lao border and [...] west of Hanoi as a target to block the Viet Minh from invading Laos. Điện Biên Phủ had a number of advantages: it was on a Viet Minh supply route into Laos on the Nam Yum River, it had an old airstrip for supply, and it was situated in the Tai hills where the Tai tribesmen, still loyal to the French, operated.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the plan}} to build a road, Bert Kienzle later said, [...] "Some twit at {{headquarters}} had looked <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> and said 'We'll put a road there'." [...] It {{has been described as a}} [...] "pipe dream". [...] Historian, Peter Brune describes it as [...] "one of the most ludicrous" [...] orders ever given. Author, Peter Fitzsimons, reports that Morris, now Major General, commander of New Guinea Force, [...] "just didn't want to hear" [...] that the task exceeded reasonable expectations, [...] "So after a little argy-bargy the senior man had pulled rank and ordered Kienzle, as a bare minimum, to evaluate it." [...] Lieutenant Noel Owers, a surveyor with New Guinea Force, had been given the task of surveying a route to Kokoda. [...] Owers prepared a report outlining a route to Kagi (about halfway to Kokoda).|$|E
2500|$|A look <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> still {{reveals the}} {{directions}} where {{the ice age}} glaciers ran. The farthest expansion of the Rhône glacier to the northeast is indicated by way the western Swiss Plateau valleys trend: The valleys of the Broye and the Glâne as well as lake Murten, lake Neuchâtel, and lake Biel that [...] trend all northeast, parallel to the Jura and to the Alps. The glaciers of the Reuss and the Limmat have carved the valleys of the central Swiss Plateau that trend northwest (among others including the valleys of the Wigger, the Suhre, the Seetal, the Reuss and the Limmat). The Rhine glacier has mostly left traces that trend west: The eastern Swiss Plateau Thur valley and lake Constance. In certain places, there are characteristic drumlins of base moraine, often clustered, especially in the highlands of Zurich, in the Hirzel region, in the lake Constance region and between the Reuss valley and the Lake Baldegg.|$|E

The pair had {{paid a visit to}} Đôn to discuss military issues at 09:15, but instead of the Vietnamese general hosting his American visitors as Joint General Staff headquarters, as was the norm, Đôn went to the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam office. Although Felt was surprised, the Americans did not realise the reason for the unusual venue and then pointed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> and wondered why two airborne battalions appeared to be idling. Đôn replied that they were going into battle, and Harkins nodded, unaware that they were entering Saigon. Harkins had told the generals earlier that he opposed a coup, so Đôn avoided the topic. Felt had been told of the existence of coup plans by Lodge, who falsely informed him that it was not imminent, saying [...] "There isn't a Vietnamese general with hair enough on his chest to make it go." [...] Felt later said that Đôn appeared to be calm and composed.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new method for mapping {{ontology}} schemas that address similar domains. The problem of ontology mapping is crucial {{since we are}} witnessing a decentralized development and publication of ontological data. We formulate the problem of inferring a match between two ontologies as a maximum likelihood problem, and solve it using the technique of expectation-maximization (EM). Specifically, we adopt directed graphs as our model for ontologies and use a generalized version of EM to arrive <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>mapping</b> between the nodes of the graphs. We exploit the structural and lexical similarity between the graphs, and improve on previous approaches by generating a many-one correspondence between the concept nodes. We provide preliminary experimental results in support of our method and outline its limitations...|$|R
40|$|Software design aims <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>mapping</b> from domain {{concepts}} to an implementation. Abstractions {{that are not}} highlighted in the implementation structure often exist only {{in the minds of}} the developers during development. While this works reasonably well for single-purpose systems, software product lines, i. e., systems built by reusing the same core functionality, require explicit presence of several types of abstractions. In particular, the relation between the implementation and underlying domain concepts, and product variance must both be mastered in parallel. In this paper, we will discuss these dimensions of concern, and introduce a way to manage them in software product lines with logical layers. The principal idea is to superimpose different aspects rather than partition the system into straightforward implementation components in the specification phase...|$|R
