25|$|WDAF radio (610 <b>AM,</b> <b>now</b> at 106.5 FM; AM {{frequency}} now {{occupied by}} KCSP) signed on in 1927 as {{an affiliate of}} the NBC Red Network, under the ownership of The Star. In 1949, the Star signed on WDAF-TV as an affiliate of the NBC television network. The Star sold off the WDAF stations in 1957, following an antitrust investigation by the United States government (reportedly launched at Truman's behest, following a long-standing feud with the Star) over the newspaper's ownership of television and radio stations. KCMO radio (originally at 810 <b>AM,</b> <b>now</b> at 710 AM) signed on KCMO-TV (now KCTV) in 1953.
