Among the pastes without EGTA, highest TGase activity was observed at 25 °C but breaking force of the gel set at 25 °C was lower than that set at 30 °, 35 °, and 40 °C. Addition of EGTA (5 m mol/kg) to the paste suppressed TGase activity at all setting temperatures from 20 ° to 40 °C. Gelation of the pastes and cross-linking of MHC on addition of EGTA were suppressed completely at 20 ° and 25 °C, partially at 30 ° and 35 °C, and not at all at 40 °C.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, the authors {{reported on the}} distribution pattern of the <b>Alaska</b> <b>pollack,</b> Theragra chalcogramma (PALLAS), which {{have been found in}} fairly large numbers during the feeding season in the adjacent waters of the Funka Bay, Hokkaido. In this paper, the distribution, migration, and spawning grounds of the adult <b>Alaska</b> <b>pollack</b> in the spawning season during August 1973 through July 1974 have been examined and is reported. The spawning season marked by the maturation stage of the gonad in the <b>Alaska</b> <b>pollack</b> lasted during January to March in 1974. The shoal migrated toward the shallow parts with the progress of maturation of their gonads; they stayed {{at the front of the}} cold water mass near the 100 meter depth. The cold water mass in the shallow parts was caused by the cooling in winter and by the upper layer water mass of the Oyashio current, 1974. The spawning grounds of the <b>Alaska</b> <b>pollack</b> varied with the intensity of cooling in winter and with the upper layer cold water mass of the Oyashio current. In 1954, the main spawning grounds were reported to be inside the Funka Bay, when the sea water temperature of the shallow parts in this region was high, but in 1974 when the sea water temperature of the shallow parts is low, its grounds were at the entrance of the Bay near the 100 - 120 meter depth. The sex ratio of the fish in the spawning season varied at each station. The male fish remained for a long time in the spawning grounds, but the female fish migrated to the deep sea areas once spawning was over. Because there were more male fish than female fish at the spawning grounds, the female fish predominated at the feeding groounds in the deep sea areas. 1. 1973 年 8 月から 1974 年 7 月に噴火湾周辺海域において底刺網による漁獲試験，魚探の利用，スケトウダラ卵の採集，海洋観測等を行い，産卵期を中心としたスケトウダラの分布回遊を明らかにした。 2. 生殖巣の成熟Stageからみた 1974 年の産卵期は 1 月から 3 月であつた。 3. 魚群は生殖巣の成熟に連れて，索餌期に棲息していた水深 300 m付近の餌生物が多い親潮系底層水域から浅海域に産卵のため回遊し，表層からの冬期冷却と寒冷な親潮系表層水の影響によつて 100 m付近に発生した冷水前線に停滞した。 4. 産卵場は冬期間の冷却と親潮系表層冷水塊の強さによって変化する。中心部は浅海域の水温が高かつた 1954 年には噴火湾の内部にみられたが，水温が低かつた 1974 年には湾ロ部の水深 100 ～ 120 m付近に形成された。 5. スケトウダラ卵の水平分布密度は魚探反応による魚群密度とほぼ一致している。しかし地球岬付近では噴火湾口部で産み出された卵が親潮系表層水によって噴火湾内に移送されており，卵の水平分布から産卵場を推定する場合には産卵群の分布や海流を考慮することが必要である。 6. 産卵期における性比は各地点によって変化している。雄は産卵場に長く留まるが，雌は産卵を終えると深海域に回避する。したがつて産卵場においては雄が雌より多く，深海域の索餌場では雌が卓越している...|$|E

Cross-linked myosin heavy chain formation was suppressed. From the result that the gel was also obtained {{in the presence of}} IAA, it would appear that TGase may not always be required for the setting of surimi paste.

For this reason, the authors investigated water temperature, salinity, food organisms and biological factors of fish once a month from February 1974 to February 1975 six definite stations. This paper deals with the examination of the seasonal variations of water mass in this area. 1. The Tsugaru warm current (salinity more than 33. 8 ‰ as an indicater of presence) enters this area through the mid-water layer in June and occupies the widest sphere in November.

The surface layer water of the Oyashio current (salinity less than 33. 2 ‰) occupies most of the surface and mid-water layers in February and gradually declines from March. In June this water is thrust toward the coastal area by the inflow of the Tsugaru warm current and almost disappears in November. 3. The bottom layer water of the Oyashio current (temperature less than 3. 5 ℃ and salinity less than 33. 7 ‰) occupies about 200 - 450 m in depth near the bottom in February, but the range gradually decreases with the inflow of the Tsugaru warm current and shows the minimum range during December and January. 著者らは前報で噴火湾周辺海域におけるスケトウダラ成魚群の索餌期と産卵期の生態について報告した。本報では年間を通した魚群環境を明らかにするために， 6 定点で 1974 年 2 月から 1975 年 2 月にかけて毎月 1 回水温と塩分を調査した結果から，水塊の季節変化を検討した。 1. 津軽暖流系水は 6 月に沖合の中層から増勢し始め， 11 月には最も広範囲を占めるようになる。しかし 12 月には劣勢に転じ， 1 - 2 月には消滅する。 2. 親潮系表層水は 2 月に最も分布域が広いが， 3 月以降は次第に衰退し， 6 月以降の津軽暖流系水の流入期には沿岸に押しやられ， 11 月には完全に消滅する。 3. 親潮系底層水は親潮系表層水とその起源を共にすることから，盛衰の季節変化がほぼ一致し， 2 月に最も強く， 12 - 1 月に最も弱く分布域も小さい...|$|E

In the spawning period, gonads of males ripen earlier than females and males migrate from the feeding grounds (300 - 350 m depth) to the spawning grounds (near 100 m depth) before females. Most of the males remain in the spawning grounds through the period, while females migrate to the spawning grounds in {{the order in which}} gonads ripen and leave soon after spawning. Consequently, males abound remarkably in the spawning grounds. There is no feeding activity among the spawners. 2. In the transitional period from the end of spawning period to the beginning of feeding period, almost all the fish disperse chiefly to the offshore area in search of their food organisms. 3. In the feeding period, adult fishes concentrate in the bottom layer water of the Oyashio current (300 - 350 m depth) which is abundant in Euphausiids and Amphipods. But, in 1974 when these food organisms were scarce fishes migrated to area near 200 m depth and fed chiefly on the young <b>Alaska</b> <b>pollack</b> and shrimp. 4. In the transitional period from the end of feeding period to the beginning of spawning period, adult fishes mature rapidly. Males begin to migrate to the spawning grounds and females continue light feeding activity in the feeding grounds. 噴火湾周辺海域において 1974 年 2 月から 1975 年 2 月にかけて毎月 1 回底刺網を用いてスケトウダラを漁獲し，その標本の生物学的資料に基づいて成魚群の生活期を 4 期に区分して月別，地点別に検討し，各生活期における生態について考察した。 1. 産卵期（ 12 - 3 月）には雄が雌より生殖巣の成熟が早く，雌に先行して産卵場になる水深 100 m付近の浅海域に集中する。雌は沖合の水深 300 - 350 m付近に多いが，生殖巣の成熟したものから順次産卵場に回遊し，産卵を終えると沖合に去る。したがって産卵場の群は雄の割合が多く，ほとんど摂餌することなく産卵活動をしている。 2. 産卵期から索餌期への移行期（ 3 月末- 4 月末）の魚群は一部産卵しているものもあるが，ほとんどのものは産卵を終え，産卵活動によって消耗したエネルギー補充のため，餌を求めて主に沖合へと広範囲に分散する。 3. 索餌期（ 5 - 10 月）には浅海域が津軽暖流系水の流入と夏期の昇温および餌料プランクトンの減少のため，寒冷で餌料プランクトン豊度が高い水深 300 - 350 mの親潮系中層水域を餌場として集群する。しかし餌料プランクトン豊度が低い年には噴火湾内から沖合の底層に回避し始めるスケトウダラ幼魚群やホッコクアカエビを捕食対象として水深 200 m以浅域にまで餌場を拡大する。 4. 索餌期から産卵期への移行期（ 10 月末- 11 月末）には生殖巣が急速に発達し，産卵態勢に入る雄が多くなり，浅海の産卵場に回遊する。雌の一部には産卵を始める個体もみられるが，産卵場に回遊する群はまだ少なく，主群は生殖巣熟度が他より遅れているため，索餌場の水深 300 - 350 mの底層に棲息し，索餌期に比べると摂餌指数は低いが，まだ摂餌活動を続けている...|$|E

Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was inhibited and free radical scavenging activity increased with increasing MDCM hydrolysate content (p< 0. 05). In conclusion, the addition of MDCM to IFP improves gel characteristics. Additionally, protein hydrolysates from MDCM serve as a potential source of ACE inhibiting peptides...|$|E
40|$|Chicken paste (Cp) is a {{material}} for foods prepared by formulating ground chicken bones into frozen blocks. It {{has not been}} clarified yet whether Cp is available and effective {{in the production of}} fish-paste products. From this viewpoint, we have examined the availability of Cp in Kamaboko by adding Cp to several fish meats. Cp showed the maximum gelation effect on <b>Alaska</b> <b>pollack,</b> common mackerel and sardine meats when added thereto in amounts of 2 %, 8 % and 4 % respectively. Thus the optimum Cp content varied depending on fishes. The gelation was more accelerated in fish meat having weak Kamaboko-forming ability such as common mackerel or sardine. Since Cp would exhibit no gelation effect alone, it is assumed that calcium contained in Cp in a large amount may affect thereon. The addition of Cp would bring about a decrease in the whitenss, so that it is suitable not for conventional Kamaboko products requiring a high whiteness but for special Kamaboko products, for example, those having a salami flavor...|$|E
30|$|Nowadays, natural {{additives}} involving antioxidants {{have gained}} attention from consumers. Protein hydrolysates, especially from marine processing byproducts, have attracted interest {{due to their}} safety as well as bioactivities (Kim and Wijesekara 2010; Gómez-Guillén et al. 2011). Enzymatic hydrolysis has been intensively employed to produce antioxidative gelatin hydrolysates (Gómez-Guillén et al. 2011). However, {{the high cost of}} production is mainly associated with enzyme, energy consumed and production process. Recently, autolysis mediated by indigenous protease was used as the aid for production of gelatin hydrolysates with antioxidative activity from unicorn leatherjacket skin that could reduce the amount of commercial proteases and energy used (Karnjanapratum and Benjakul 2014 a). The selection of proper enzyme to substrate was crucial for production of antioxidative gelatin hydrolysate from <b>Alaska</b> <b>pollack</b> skin (Kim et al. 2001). Kittiphattanabawon et al. (2012) found that glycyl endopeptidase, the major cysteine protease in papaya latex, showed the effectiveness in cleaving peptide bonds with Gly at P 1 of fish gelatin from blacktip shark skin, yielding antioxidative gelatin hydrolysate with high degree of hydrolysis. Additionally, the active fraction of glycyl endopeptidase from papaya latex was prepared using aqueous two-phase system to remove offensive odour compounds (Karnjanapratum and Benjakul 2014 b).|$|E
40|$|A {{satisfactory}} {{separation of}} the molecular species of fish muscle lecithin was made by modifying the lecithin into diglceride acetate for high performance reversed phase liquid chromatography (HPLC), The molecular species of each chromatographic peak was determined by fatty acid composition and by total acyl carbon number analysis subsequent to separation, using a thin layer chronatographic technique with silver nitrate impregnated silica ged plated (Ag+-TLC). After plotting the relative retention time (RRT) of each molecular species from soybean, egg yolk, chum salmon, big-eyed tuna, <b>Alaska</b> <b>pollack,</b> and carp muscle lecithins semilogarithmically against the total cayl carbon number {{of the number of}} total double bonds of each molecular species, a set of parallel straight oblique lines was obtained. Thus we can express the molecular species in matrix relation by giving a variable integer x for the acyl carbon number and a variable integery for the number of double bonds of each fatty acid in the molecular species. By using the correlations between the RRTs and the corresponding molecular species on semilogarithmic plots, it was conclude that an identification of molecular species from fish lipids could be done by RRTs from HPLC...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Between 1988 and 1997, Japanese {{fish and}} {{shellfish}} catch dropped by 42 percent, falling to its lowest level in 31 years. Domestic prices sharply increased, but per capita {{fish and shellfish}} consumption is still {{higher than that of}} all meats. To meet rising demand, Japan became the world's largest importer, absorbing one third of global fish and shellfish imports, and the United States became its largest supplier up to 1996, when the United States was superceded by China. Outlook for exporting to Japan is excellent because the U. S. catch contains most of the species prized highly in the Japanese market, such as salmon, crabs, and <b>Alaska</b> <b>pollack.</b> Keywords: World fish market, U. S. fish exports, Japan's fish imports, and per capita fish and meat consumption. The Role of Fish in the Japanese Diet The Japanese diet traditionally has relied mainly on rice for calories and on seafood for animal protein. An island nation, Japan has looked to the sea to supplement the limited food supply derived from its small agricultural land area. Raising livestock to supply animal protein for meat consumption is a relatively new phenomenon in Japan's history, beginning in the Meiji era (1868 - 1912...|$|E
40|$|With {{a view to}} {{reducing}} the content of salt, i. e. sodium chloride (NaCl) in preparing kamaboko (fish jelly products), influences of potassium chloride (KCl), calcium chloride (CaCl₂) and magnesium chloride (MgCl₂) as substitutes for NaCl on the gel-forming ability of kamaboko and their combined effects with sodium polyphosphate (PP) were examined. The addition of these salts as substitutes for NaCl was within 0. 6 % for KCl and CaCl₂ (NaCl 2. 4 %, 20 % as a rate of substitution), 1. 2 % for MgCl₂ (NaCl 1. 8 %, 40 % as a rate of substitution) in fish meat with a comparatively high gel-forming ability and 0. 6 % for MgCl₂ (NaCl 2. 4 %, 20 % as a rate of substitution) in that with a comparatively low gel-forming ability. On the other hand, the addition of MgCl₂ as substitute for NaCl {{in the presence of}} PP 0. 2 % was 0. 6 % for MgCl₂ (NaCl 2. 4 %, 20 % as a rate of substitution) in other fish meat with a comparatively low gel-forming ability, except for frozen minced meat (e. g. <b>Alaska</b> <b>pollack</b> frozen surimi). The addition to this extent has scarcely influenced the taste of kamaboko...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to study the changes {{undergone}} by starch during heat-induced surimi gel preparation either with or without added egg white, and their effects {{on the structure of}} gels using light and scanning electron microscopy. Gels were made from SA-grade <b>Alaska</b> <b>pollack</b> (Theragra chalcogramma) surimi with: (1) salt (3 %, w/w); (2) salt and waxy corn starch (3 % and 5 %, respectively w/w); or (3) salt, waxy corn starch and egg white (3 %, 5 % and 5 %, respectively, w/w). Final moisture was adjusted to 73 % or 83 %. The gels were prepared by prior setting (40 °C, 30 min, followed by 90 °C, 30 min) or cooking (90 °C, 30 min). The prepared gel was frozen and stored at - 20 °C (± 1 °C) until analysis. Samples were observed by light and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the starch granules alter according to the processing conditions, with the predominance of crystalline or amorphous morphology depending upon the availability of heat and water. Large cavities formed in the protein gel matrix during setting can trap water; as a result, water availability is limited for starch to swell and gelatinize even in the high-moisture gel. © Springer-Verlag 1998.

40|$|Since the {{development}} of 'frozen mince ' (reito surimi) from <b>Alaska</b> <b>pollack</b> in 1959, {{there has been a}} remarkable increase in the catch of this North Pacific fish, resulting in a supply of three million tonnes of fish per year to the Japanese market. The frozen mince technique is based on the prevention of denatura-tion, during freezing, of the fish actomyosin by the removal of albumins and inorganic salts and by the addition of sucrose and polyphosphates. Based on a fundamental study of frozen fish mince, the author and his colleagues have proposed some twenty new cryoprotective additive compounds, among which glutamate and aspartate have the greatest effect. These compounds can also modify the eating quality of cooked products. These results, together with the technical success of fish mince and a proposal for another new tech-nique, illustrate the potential for products developed from fish mince {{in many areas of the}} world. The success of the frozen surimi (frozen mince or reito surimi) industry in Japan presents an example of the successful development of an unutilized food resource by introducing an original technique. This paper deals with a profile of the frozen surimi industry, its scientific background and an analysis of the conditions which were instrumental t o success...|$|E
