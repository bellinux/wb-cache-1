By 1987, however, Muammar Gaddafi had lost his allies, exposing Libya's inadequate knowledge of the area. Libyan garrisons came to resemble isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian Sahara. Also important was the low morale among the troops, who were fighting in <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>country,</b> and the structural disorganization of the Libyan army, which was in part induced by Gaddafi's fear of a military coup against him.

5|$|One {{issue that}} has arisen is whether a Singaporean who votes in <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>country</b> where {{the right to vote}} is not {{exclusive}} to nationals of that country is disqualified from voting in a Singapore election.

When queried, the Elections Department stated that since suffrage in the UK is not exclusive to British citizens, Singaporeans who vote there are still eligible to vote in Singapore.

40|$|Investors {{can access}} foreign {{diversification}} opportunities through either {{foreign portfolio investment}} (FPI) or foreign direct investment (FDI). By combining data on US outbound FPI and FDI, this paper analyzes whether the composition of US outbound capital flows reflect efforts to bypass home country tax regimes and weak host country investor protections. The cross-country analysis indicates that a 10 % decrease in <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>country's</b> corporate tax rate increases US investors' equity FPI holdings by 21 %, controlling for effects on FDI. This suggests that the residual tax on foreign multinational firm earnings biases capital flows to low corporate tax countries toward FPI. A one standard deviation increase in <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>country's</b> investor protections is shown {{to be associated with}} a 24 % increase in US investors' equity FPI holdings. These results are robust to various controls, are not evident for debt capital flows, and are confirmed using an instrumental variables analysis. The use of FPI to bypass home country taxation of multinational firms is also apparent using only portfolio investment responses to within-country corporate tax rate changes in a panel from 1994 to 2005. Investors appear to alter their portfolio choices to circumvent home and host country institutional regimes. ...|$|R

The trials were held under the Royal Warrant of 18 June 1945, thus under British Military Law. The decision put the trials on a shaky legal basis, as foreign nationals were being tried for crimes against foreigners in <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>country.</b> The first trial, held in Rome, was of Mackensen and Mälzer for their part in the Ardeatine massacre. Both were sentenced to death on 30 November 1946.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the emperor}} held supreme power, he more often sought {{the advice of}} his cabinet and other ministers before making {{decisions}} and when revoking them. He often assembled leading officials for debates or discussions on policy, known as court conferences (tingyi 廷議).

Although the emperor could reject the decisions reached by his court conference, he did so at the risk of alienating his leading ministers.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between lagged stock returns and export growth in a panel of worldwide markets. Previous {{studies have focused on}} analyzing the effect of future economic output growth on stock returns. This study finds that annualized changes in <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>country’s</b> exports to the United States five to seven years in the future, defined as long-term, positively predict the annual stock market returns while the nation’s total export changes are already priced-in. An additional percentage point increase in long-term exports to the United States growth results in a 0. 1 to 3. 5 percentage point rise in annual stock returns. However, both growth in total exports and those to the United States do not predict equity returns over the short-term, defined as average annual growth from year 0 to year 4. Thus, establishing a foothold and cracking the highly competitive and homogeneous United States market is not guaranteed and unpredictable, requiring 5 years of investments before successful foreign firms are able convert it into earnings. Alternatively, investors may be shortsighted, uninformed, and pay limited attention about <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>country’s</b> exports to the United States beyond their forecast horizon, for example, five years. Moreover, the analysis finds that GDP growth at both the <b>foreign</b> <b>country</b> and United States level does not affect lagged foreign stock returns and could be priced-in, unlike long-term growth in the nation’s exports to United States...|$|R
