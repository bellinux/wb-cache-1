Samuel resigned as Treasurer in the Cowper ministry after his budget proposals for trade licences and increased duties on tea and sugar had been defeated. In 1870, at the Intercolonial Conference in Melbourne, Samuel proposed intercolonial free trade to settle the border customs dispute.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that spatial {{equilibrium}} model is used as an efficient analytical tool of international trade. But {{it is very difficult to}} take specific duties and <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>duties</b> into consideration when we try to apply the spatial equilibrium model to analyze the real international trade under complex tariff quota system. This paper is the sequel of Shono and Kawaguchi (1999), which present a spatial equilibrium model of perfectly competitive international trade under real tariff quota system with specific duties and <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>duties,</b> but which does not present such a model of imperfectly competitive international trade. In this paper, based on the concept of shadow prices and Linear Complementarity Problem, we show how to take specific duties and <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>duties</b> into consideration when we try to apply the model, and present a spatial equilibrium model of international trade, which can be used as an efficient and general analytical tool of oligopolistic international trade of some type under real traiff quota system with specific duties and <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>duties.</b> We also present simple examples of the model and solve the example problems to get equilibrium solutions.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of antidumping (AD) duties on the pricing behaviour of exporters targeted with these measures. Using product and firm-level data for South Korea, the study provides evidence of increased export unit values and firms' markups following the imposition of AD <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>duties.</b> These {{findings are consistent with}} the hypothesis that, unlike other import tariffs, AD duties are not absorbed by exporters. The results on firms' average markups also suggest that the price adjustment following the imposition of AD duties occurs mostly through the export price, and not through reductions in the exporter's home price. The analysis controls for the presence of other trade measures as well as the endogeneity in AD and other contingent protection measures...|$|E

The paper then looks at the conditionalities of the WTO Agriculture Chair’s December 2008 text (TN/AG/W/ 4 /Rev. 4). These include exclusion of en route shipments from the price-based SSM coverage; the trigger and remedy, and the omission to take into account the value declines in <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>duties</b> when prices drop; the cross-check; and the exclusion of preferential trade from SSM coverage. An analysis of these conditionalities is provided. Some of these clauses, if agreed upon, will severely curtail countries ’ ability to invoke the price-based SSM.

A {{permission}} to call when all her other acquaintances would be there, was not much; but still, perhaps, it was {{as much as he could}} expect to obtain on that occasion. He looked up and saw that Lord Dumbello's eyes were again upon him, and that Lord Dumbello's brow was black. He began to doubt whether a country house, where all the people were thrown together, was the best place in the world for such manoeuvring. Lady Dumbello was very handsome, and he liked to look at her, but he could not find any subject on which to interest her in that drawing-room at Hartlebury. Later in the evening he found himself saying something to her about the sugar duties, and then he knew that he had better give it up. He had only one day more, and that was required imperatively for his speech. The matter would go much easier in London, and he would postpone it till then. In the crowded rooms of London private conversation would be much easier, and Lord Dumbello wouldn't stand over and look at him. Lady Dumbello had taken his remarks about the sugar very kindly, and had asked for a definition of an <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>duty.</b> It was a nearer approach to a real conversation than he had ever before made; but the subject had been unlucky, and could not, in his hands, be brought round to anything tender; so he resolved to postpone his gallantry till the London spring should make it easy, and felt as he did so that he was relieved for the time from a heavy weight.|$|R

The paper describes landings of fish, production of aquatic species, import and export of fish and the development of the consumption of seafood. The analysis shows that the total consumption of fish has stagnated in Sweden, however it is possible to identify differences at product level. The interesting thing is that both import to and export from Sweden are increasing steadily. The per capita consumption of seafood is low, also relative to consumption of meat. There is an unrealized potential for further growth in the Swedish seafood market. A realization of the growth potential is a matter of offensive marketing and not least supplying fish at competitive prices relative to food prices and quality in general...|$|R
