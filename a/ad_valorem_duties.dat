40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of antidumping (AD) duties on the pricing behaviour of exporters targeted with these measures. Using product and firm-level data for South Korea, the study provides evidence of increased export unit values and firms' markups following the imposition of AD <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>duties.</b> These {{findings are consistent with}} the hypothesis that, unlike other import tariffs, AD duties are not absorbed by exporters. The results on firms' average markups also suggest that the price adjustment following the imposition of AD duties occurs mostly through the export price, and not through reductions in the exporter's home price. The analysis controls for the presence of other trade measures as well as the endogeneity in AD and other contingent protection measures...|$|E

An analysis of these conditionalities is provided. Some of these clauses, if agreed upon, will severely curtail countries â ability to invoke the price-based SSM.

He began to doubt whether a country house, where all the people were thrown together, was the best place in the world for such manoeuvring. Lady Dumbello was very handsome, and he liked to look at her, but he could not find any subject on which to interest her in that drawing-room at Hartlebury. Later in the evening he found himself saying something to her about the sugar duties, and then he knew that he had better give it up. He had only one day more, and that was required imperatively for his speech. The matter would go much easier in London, and he would postpone it till then. In the crowded rooms of London private conversation would be much easier, and Lord Dumbello wouldn't stand over and look at him. Lady Dumbello had taken his remarks about the sugar very kindly, and had asked for a definition of an <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>duty.</b> It was a nearer approach to a real conversation than he had ever before made; but the subject had been unlucky, and could not, in his hands, be brought round to anything tender; so he resolved to postpone his gallantry till the London spring should make it easy, and felt as he did so that he was relieved for the time from a heavy weight.|$|R

The interesting thing is that both import to and export from Sweden are increasing steadily. The per capita consumption of seafood is low, also relative to consumption of meat. There is an unrealized potential for further growth in the Swedish seafood market. A realization of the growth potential is a matter of offensive marketing and not least supplying fish at competitive prices relative to food prices and quality in general...|$|R
