500|$|A {{national}} telephone {{poll conducted}} {{in the second quarter}} of 2011 by Fairleigh Dickinson University’s PublicMind showed that a majority of American voters (57%) agreed that states should have the “right to regulate the sale of video games [...] in order to protect minors; the same way states regulate tobacco, alcohol and pornography.” On the other hand, 39% of voters agreed with the Court’s majority that “parents should make the decision” about what video games they purchase for their children, and what constitutes “too violent.” These voters agreed with the statement “states do not have the right to decide that some video games are too violent for , <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> have the right to decide what literature or fairy tales are too violent.” The poll was conducted before the Court released its decision on June 27, 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Although Hazlitt {{retained}} a few devoted admirers, his reputation {{among the general}} public had been demolished by the cadre of reviewers in Tory periodicals whose efforts Hazlitt had excoriated in [...] "On the Jealousy and the Spleen of Party". [...] According to John Wilson of Blackwood's Magazine, for example, Hazlitt had already [...] "been excommunicated from all decent society, and nobody would touch a dead book of his, <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> would {{the body of a}} man who had died of the plague".|$|E
2500|$|The second stage, Pahawh Njia Dua O (Pajhawj Ntsiab Duas Ob) [...] "second stage reduced version", was {{the first}} {{practical}} Hmong script. It was taught by Shong in 1965 and is supported today by the Australian Language Institute and Cwjmem (Everson 1999). The consonants are graphically regular, in that each column in the pedagogic charts contains the same diacritic, but are phonetically irregular, in that the diacritics have no consistent meaning. (This situation remained in all later stages.) Tone assignment is irregular, in that the diacritics do not represent specific tones with the rimes <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> represent specific features with the consonants. For example, the trema sometimes represents the -b tone, sometimes -j, -v, or -g, depending on which rime it is added to. The one exception is the -d [...] "tone", which is actually a prosodic inflection of the -m tone. Shong added a specific diacritic for this when Chia, who was familiar with RPA, asked him how RPA -d should be written, but it was treated as extraneous to the tone system, {{was not included in}} the rime charts, and was not always taught to Shong's disciples.|$|E
2500|$|McLaughlin's wife, Irene Castle, {{designed}} {{the original version}} of the team's logo, which featured a crudely-drawn black and white Native head in a circle. This design went through several significant changes between 1926 and 1955. During this period, seven distinct versions of the primary logo were worn on the team's uniforms. At {{the beginning of the}} 1955–56 season, the outer circle was removed and the head began to resemble the team's current primary logo. This crest and uniform went through subtle changes until the 1964–65 season; the basic logo and jersey design have remained constant ever since. In 2008, The Hockey News staff voted the team's main logo to be the best in the NHL. In 2010, sports columnist Damien Cox called on the franchise to retire the [...] "racially insensitive" [...] logo, saying that, [...] "Clearly, no right-thinking person would name a team after an aboriginal figure these days <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> would use Muslims or Africans or Chinese or any ethnic group to depict a specific sporting notion." [...] Furthermore, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) believes that all Native-themed logos, including that of the Blackhawks, [...] "continue to profit from harmful stereotypes originated during a time when white superiority and segregation were common place." ...|$|E
