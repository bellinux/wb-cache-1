500|$|In the mitochondrion, {{pyruvate}} is oxidized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase {{complex to}} the acetyl group, which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle (also {{known as the}} Krebs cycle). Every [...] "turn" [...] of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP guanosine triphosphate (GTP) through substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase, three molecules of NADH, and one equivalent of FADH2. NADH and FADH2 are recycled (to NAD+ and FAD, respectively), generating additional ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. The oxidation of NADH results in the synthesis of 2–3 equivalents of ATP, and the oxidation of one FADH2 yields between 1–2 equivalents of ATP. The majority of cellular ATP is generated by this process. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular oxygen, it is an obligately <b>aerobic</b> <b>process</b> because O2 is used to recycle the NADH and FADH2. In the absence of oxygen, the citric acid cycle ceases.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOxygen {{availability}} drives {{changes in}} microbial diversity and biogeochemical cycling between the aerobic surface layer and the anaerobic core in nitrite-rich anoxic marine zones (AMZs), which constitute huge oxygen-depleted {{regions in the}} tropical oceans. The current paradigm is that primary production and nitrification within the oxic surface layer fuel anaerobic processes in the anoxic core of AMZs, where 30 - 50 % of global marine nitrogen loss takes place. Here we demonstrate that oxygenic photosynthesis in the secondary chlorophyll maximum (SCM) releases significant amounts of O 2 to the otherwise anoxic environment. The SCM, commonly found within AMZs, was dominated by the picocyanobacteria Prochlorococcus spp. Free O 2 levels in this layer were, however, undetectable by conventional techniques, reflecting a tight coupling between O 2 production and consumption by <b>aerobic</b> <b>processes</b> under apparent anoxic conditions. Transcriptomic analysis of the microbial community in the seemingly anoxic SCM revealed the enhanced expression of genes for <b>aerobic</b> <b>processes,</b> such as nitrite oxidation.

50|$|Composting is an <b>aerobic</b> <b>process</b> {{of mixing}} sewage sludge with {{agricultural}} byproduct sources of carbon such as sawdust, straw or wood chips. In {{the presence of}} oxygen, bacteria digesting both the sewage sludge and the plant material generate heat to kill disease-causing microorganisms and parasites. Maintenance of aerobic conditions with 10 to 15 percent oxygen requires bulking agents allowing air to circulate through the fine sludge solids. Stiff materials like corn cobs, nut shells, shredded tree-pruning waste, or bark from lumber or paper mills better separate sludge for ventilation than softer leaves and lawn clippings.

50|$|Mulch {{normally}} {{smells like}} freshly cut wood, but sometimes develops a toxicity that causes it to smell like vinegar, ammonia, sulfur or silage.

Once {{exposed to the}} air, the process quickly reverts to an <b>aerobic</b> <b>process,</b> but these toxic materials may be present {{for a period of}} time. If the mulch is placed around plants before the toxicity has had a chance to dissipate, then the plants could very likely be damaged or killed depending on their hardiness.

NOx produced by industrial processes, automobiles and agricultural fertilization and NH3 emitted from soils (i.e., as an additional byproduct of nitrification) and livestock operations are transported to downwind ecosystems, influencing N cycling and nutrient losses. Six major effects of NOx and NH3 emissions have been cited: 1) decreased atmospheric visibility due to ammonium aerosols (fine particulate matter PM); 2) elevated ozone concentrations; 3) ozone and PM affects human health (e.g. respiratory diseases, cancer); 4) increases in radiative forcing and global climate change; 5) decreased agricultural productivity due to ozone deposition; and 6) ecosystem acidification and eutrophication.|$|E
