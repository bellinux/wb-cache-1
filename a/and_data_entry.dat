30|$|Surveys {{are used}} {{extensively}} {{to gather information}} from clinical, market, and psychological research studies. However, this process is time-consuming and error-prone especially with the tedious <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> Psychvey is a web and mobile application that allows the easy design, creation, analysis, and taking part in surveys electronically. Collected data are easily exported into spreadsheets for subsequent statistical analysis, displacing the physical collection of survey responses <b>and</b> manual <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> This allows for added confidential security <b>and</b> prevents <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> errors while maximising participants’ convenience. Psychvey facilitates data collection from simple surveys to long multi-typed studies and aids studies <b>and</b> <b>data</b> collection, thus catering to {{a whole range of}} purposes.|$|R

The selection of a mobile computing platform is contingent upon the amount <b>and</b> complexity of <b>data.</b> [...] To ensure successful implementation, it is important to examine the strengths and limitations of each device. Tablets are more functional for high volume <b>and</b> complex <b>data</b> <b>entry,</b> <b>and</b> are favoured for their screen size, and capacity to run more complex functions. PDAs are more functional for low volume <b>and</b> simple <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> <b>and</b> are preferred for their lightweight, portability and long battery life.|$|R

40|$|In the {{administration}} of quantitative research instruments it has been customary to use 'pencil and paper' forms, with the researcher distributing forms, collating the responses <b>and</b> supervising <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> into a structured database. The advancements in connected-computer technologies and statistical software applications offer quantitative researchers a more streamlined method for the collection, storage, manipulation <b>and</b> dissemination of <b>data.</b> These advancements {{have made it possible}} to dispose of, in appropriate studies, 'paper-and-pencil' instruments <b>and</b> manual <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> However, the use of the internet, as with any method of collecting data, does have limitations and many of these are technical. This paper explores the technical issues associated with the development of connected-computer, quantitative instruments...|$|R
