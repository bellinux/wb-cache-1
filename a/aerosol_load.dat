5000|$|Lidars {{are capable}} of {{retrieving}} the complete wind vector based on the optical Doppler effect. The so-called Doppler lidars can capture the movement of molecules and particles by detecting the frequency shift of the backscattered light. In particular, supposing that the emitting radiation is at a frequency f0=c/λ0, where λ0 is the wavelength of the laser beam, for a moving target (i.e., aerosol particle or molecule) with a relative line-of-sight velocity v, the backscattered light detected by the lidar receiver has a frequency shift equal to Δf=2v/c. The particle velocity is defined where a positive line-of-sight velocity means that a target is moving towards the lidar and leads to a positive frequency shift. In literature regarding lidar applications, the line-of-sight velocity is always referred as radial velocity. The magnitude of the shift can be detected by several methods, the major being coherent and direct-detection detection techniques [...] When aerosols are used as tracers, {{the strength of the}} return signal depends upon the <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> in the atmosphere and this is known to be dependent upon geographic location, the condition of the atmosphere, and the synoptic situation. The operational wavelength can be any wavelength sensitive to the underlying particle sizes. In general, aerosol return improves at lower wavelengths in the UV band. Nevertheless, the lidar signal gets more sensitive to air molecules in the UV band, and an expected aerosol-to-molecule backscatter ratio is harder to be met. Doppler lidars are usually pointed to zenith and provide vertically-resolved profiles of the vertical wind component. Scanning techniques are applied to retrieve the horizontal wind component. Several such systems are operated from the ground for applications related to e.g. airports, wind-farms, study of the Planetary Boundary Layer turbulence etc. The ADM-Aeolus satellite mission of the European Space Agency, will be the first wind lidar to operate from space.|$|E

Aerosols attributable to the Pinatubo eruption were detected in the stratosphere late in September; during autumn and early winter the stratospheric <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> slowly increased. In the region above approximately 18 km the <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> depended on the location of the station relative to the polar vortex. A temporary increase of the aerosol concentration was detected up to about 26 km at the beginning of February, when Thule was located for a few days outside the vortex.

AOT products retrieved from POLDER on low <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> days, and products from a radiometric instrument (MODIS) on high and low <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> days, are presented for comparison. Our study reveals that for high aerosol days, the monitoring capability of the polarized instrument is lower than that of the traditional instrument. The accuracy of matched POLDER fine-AOTs is lower than that of MODIS-matched AOTs. On low <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> days, the performance of the polarized instrument is good when monitoring the aerosol optical thickness. Further analysis reveals that for the high <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> days, the mean relative errors of matched POLDER fine AOTs and MODIS AOTs with respect to AERONET measurements are 44 % and 16 %, respectively. For the low <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> days, the mean relative errors of POLDER and MODIS measurements with respect to AERONET measurements are 41 % and 40 %, respectively. During high aerosol days, POLDER-retrieved fine-AOTs reveal a poor accuracy with only 14 % of matches falling within the error range, which is nearly one fourth of the MODIS regression results (51. 59 %).

Over all urban clusters, for all SLP regimes, CC {{is found to}} increase with AOD, thus {{pointing out that the}} CC dependence on AOD is not solely due to meteorological co-variability. WV is found to have a stronger impact on CC than AOD. This impact is more pronounced at high <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> than at low <b>aerosol</b> <b>load.</b> Hence, studies of AOD-CC relationships based on satellite data, might greatly overestimate or underestimate the AOD impact on CC in regions where AOD and WV have similar or opposite seasonal variations, respectively. Further, this impact shows that the hydrological cycle interferes with the aerosol climatic impact and we need to improve our understanding of this interference.

40|$|Significant inter-annual {{variability}} of biomass burning {{was observed in}} South America over the 2007 – 2009 period. The 2007 number of fires detected from space in South America, {{as well as the}} magnitude of the atmospheric <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> resulting from fire activity, was the largest over the last ten years. The huge 2007 increase in fire activity was followed by large reductions in the 2008 and 2009 burning seasons. Large drops of the atmospheric load of carbonaceous aerosols over the subcontinent, relative to previous years, was registered in 2008 and 2009 by the OMI sensor onboard the Aura platform, and the MODIS sensors on the Terra and Aqua satellites. The 2009 fire season in South America was the least active of the last ten years. Satellite observations of fire statistics, precipitation, and aerosol optical depth data were used to analyze the fire season over South America and Central Africa during the last ten years to understand the factors that led to the 2007 and 2009 extremes. An analysis of precipitation anomaly data shows that the largest 6 -month (May–October) precipitation deficit of the last ten years in South America occurred during 2007. The same analysis indicates that in 2009, this region experienced the largest excess precipitation of the decade. Since precipitation is the most important meteorological factor controlling biomass burning activity, it can be concluded that the 2007 maximum and 2009 minimum in fire activity and <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> were driven by the observed levels of precipitation. Analysis of the precipitation record, however, does not explain the extremely low 2008 biomass burning activity. Although the 2008 precipitation deficit was similar in magnitude to the one that in 2005 contributed to the second most intense biomass burning season in the last ten years, the 2008 fire season was surprisingly weak. The combined analysis of satellite data on atmospheric <b>aerosol</b> <b>load,</b> fire counts and precipitation strongly suggests that the observed 2008 decline in <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> and fire activity in South America was heavily influenced by conditions other than meteorological factors...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the potential {{effects on the}} ozone layer of gases released by the engines of proposed high altitude supersonic aircraft. The major problem arises from the emissions of nitrogen oxides which {{have the potential to}} destroy significant quantities of ozone in the stratosphere. The magnitude of the perturbation is highly dependent on the cruise altitude of the aircraft. Furthermore, the depletion of ozone is substantially reduced when heterogeneous conversion of nitrogen oxides into nitric acid on sulfate aerosol particles is taken into account in the calculation. The sensitivity of the <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> on stratospheric ozone is investigated. First, the model indicates that the <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> induced by the SO 2 released by aircraft is increased by about 10 - 20 % above the background aerosols at mid-high latitude of the Northern Hemisphere at 15 km for the NASA emission scenario A (the NASA emission scenarios are explained in Tables I to III). This increase in aerosol has small effects on stratospheric ozone. Second, when the <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> is increased following a volcanic eruption similar to the eruption of El Chichon (Mexico, April 1982), the ozone column in spring increases by as much as 9 % in response to the injection of NOx from the aircraft with the NASA emission scenario A.

However, in 2005 the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) aboard the TRMM satellite observed anomalously high lightning activity in that area. In the same year the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measured anomalously high <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading.</b> The high <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> was traced to volcanic activity, and not to any factor linked to meteorology, disentangling the usual convolution between aerosols and meteorology. We show that in general lightning activity is tightly correlated with aerosol loadings at both inter-annual and biweekly time scales. We estimate that a approximately 60 % increase in <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> leads to more than 150 % increase in lightning flashes. Aerosols increase lightning activity through modification of cloud microphysics. Cloud ice particle sizes are reduced and cloud glaciation is delayed to colder temperature when <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> is increased. TRMM precipitation radar measurements indicate that anomalously high <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> is associated with enhanced cloud mixed phase activity and invigorated convection over the maritime ocean.

The upper limit was obtained using a viscous settling method. These results suggest that the steady-state extraterrestrial influxes of halogens are minor compared to tropospheric sources but the sulfur input may be comparable to the present observed stratospheric content.

Based on long-term observations, we revealed that NPF seen in a central large city of the basin (Budapest) and its regional background occur in a consistent and spatially coherent way as a result of a joint atmospheric phenomenon taking place on large horizontal scales. We found that NPF events at the urban site are usually delayed by >  1  h relative to the rural site or even inhibited above a critical condensational sink level. The urban processes require higher formation rates and growth rates to be realized, by mean factors of 2 and 1. 6, respectively, than the regional events.

40|$|Atmospheric {{particulate}} matter (aerosols), originating from {{both natural and}} anthropogenic sources, is affecting the regional and global climate through direct, indirect, and semi-direct effects on the radiative energy budget of the Earth-atmosphere system. In order to quantify these effects {{it is necessary to}} determine the load of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. An effective {{way to do this is}} by measuring the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The higher the AOD values the greater the <b>aerosol</b> <b>load.</b> Along with AOD, the Fine mode Fraction (contribution of particles smaller than 1 μm to the total AOD, FF) is an effective parameter for the characterization of the aerosol, providing a rough proxy for the size of the particle present in a region at a particular time. In this study, I investigate the spatiotemporal variability of the AOD, FF, fine and coarse mode AOD over the Northwestern European Seas (that extend from 43 ° N to 67 ° N and from 10 ° W to 31 ° E), where the presence of both natural and anthropogenic particles is significant. Anthropogenic particles (both primary and secondary aerosols, mostly fine mode) originate from ship activity, or from urban-industrial and fossil fuel and biomass burning processes. The natural, coarse mode particles are primarily originated either from the oceans (sea salt particles) or from the desserts (dessert dust particles). In the present study I use mean daily aerosol data (Collection 006 Level- 3) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument that is on board Aqua satellite. These data are available in 1 ° × 1 ° resolution (ca. 100 km × 100 km). The study period extends from 2002 until 2014. A significant spatial variability of the <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> is observed over the study region. On annual level, the highest AOD values (up to 0. 32) are observed over the English Channel and the coasts of the Netherlands and Germany. The highest FF values (values up to 0. 77) are observed over the same regions, indicating that a large contribution of the <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> is from anthropogenic particles. Offshore (at remote regions), both AOD and FF are lower compared to coastal regions, thus indicating the predominance of maritime aerosols (sea salt particles). The data also show a clear seasonal cycle, with larger <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> observed during spring and summer period (AOD up to 0. 60), and lower during autumn and winter period (AOD up to 0. 30). A similar pattern is observed only for the FF, implying a larger contribution of anthropogenic particles during spring and summer period compared to autumn and winter period. The highest FF values (up to 0. 80 - 0. 85) are observed during summer over the Baltic Sea, while year-round the lowest values are observed in remote maritime areas, mostly in the northern part of the study region, accentuating the predominance of maritime/sea salt particles. The AOD experiences an overall decreasing trend over most of the study region (slope range between - 0. 18 to 0. 05 per decade). Over the northwestern ocean parts of the study region positive values are observed (sea salt particles are dominating), while over most of the rest study region parts the slope is of the order of - 0. 02 to - 0. 05 per decade. These decreasing AOD trends are associated with a reduction of mostly the fine mode AOD. Therefore it can be assumed that the decrease of the <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> over the study region is mainly due to the reduction of the anthropogenic emissions.

40|$|An {{increase}} in atmospheric <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> could alter the microphysics, dynamics, and radiative characteristics of deep convective clouds. Earlier modeling {{studies have shown}} that the effects of increased aerosols on the amount of precipitation from deep convective clouds are model-dependent. This study aims to understand the effects of increased <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> on a deep convective cloud throughout its lifetime with the use of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model as a cloud-resolving model (CRM). It simulates an idealized supercell thunderstorm with 8 different aerosol loadings, for three different cloud microphysics schemes. Variation in aerosol concentration is mimicked by varying either cloud droplet number concentration or the number of activated cloud condensation nuclei. We show that the sensitivity to <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> is dependent on the choice of microphysics scheme. For the schemes that are sensitive to <b>aerosols</b> <b>loading,</b> the production of graupel via riming of snow is the key factor determining the precipitation response. The formulation of snow riming depends on the microphysics scheme and is usually a function of two competing effects, the size effect and the number effect. In many simulations, a decrease in riming is seen with increased <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading,</b> due to the decreased droplet size that lowers the riming efficiency drastically. This decrease in droplet size also results in a delay in the onset of precipitation, as well as so-called warm rain suppression. Although these characteristics of convective invigoration (Rosenfeld et al., 2008) are seen in the first few hours of the simulations, variation in the accumulated precipitation mainly stems from graupel production rather than convective invigoration. These results emphasize the importance of accurate representations of graupel formation in microphysics schemes...|$|R

Using 12  years of in situ and satellite observations, we examined the association of <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> with cloud fraction, cloud top pressure, cloud top temperature, and daily surface rainfall over the Indian summer monsoon region (ISMR). Our results showed positive correlations between <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> and cloud properties as well as rainfall. A decrease in outgoing longwave radiation and an increase in reflected shortwave radiation {{at the top of the}} atmosphere with an increase in <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> further indicates a possible seminal role of aerosols in the deepening of cloud systems. Significant perturbation in liquid- and ice-phase microphysics was also evident over the ISMR. For the polluted cases, delay in the onset of collision–coalescence processes and an enhancement in the condensation efficiency allows for more condensate mass to be lifted up to the mixed colder phases. This results in the higher mass concentration of larger-sized ice-phase hydrometeors and, therefore, implies that the delayed rain processes eventually lead to more surface rainfall. A numerical simulation of a typical rainfall event case over the ISMR using a spectral bin microphysical scheme coupled with the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF-SBM) model was also performed. Simulated microphysics also illustrated that the initial suppression of warm rain coupled with an increase in updraft velocity under high <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> leads to enhanced super-cooled liquid droplets above freezing level and ice-phase hydrometeors, resulting in increased accumulated surface rainfall. Thus, both observational and numerical analysis suggest that high <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> may induce cloud invigoration, thereby increasing surface rainfall over the ISMR. While the meteorological variability influences the strength of the observed positive association, our results suggest that the persistent aerosol-associated deepening of cloud systems and an intensification of surface rain amounts was applicable to all the meteorological sub-regimes over the ISMR. Hence, we believe that these results provide a step forward in our ability to address aerosol–cloud–rainfall associations based on satellite observations over the ISMR...|$|R
40|$|How do {{changes in}} the amount and {{properties}} of aerosol affect warm clouds? Recent studies suggest that they have opposing effects. Some suggest that an increase in <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> leads to enhanced evaporation and therefore smaller clouds, whereas other studies suggest clouds' invigoration. In this study, using an axisymmetric bin-microphysics cloud model, we propose a theoretical scheme that analyzes the evolution of key processes in warm clouds, under different <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> and environmental conditions, to explain this contradiction. Such {{an analysis of the}} key processes reveals a robust reversal in the trend of the clouds' response to an increase in <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading.</b> When <b>aerosol</b> conditions are shifted from superpristine to slightly polluted, the clouds formed are deeper and have larger water mass. Such a trend continues up to an optimal concentration (N op) that allows the cloud to achieve a maximal water mass. Hence, for any concentration below N op the cloud formed contains less mass and therefore can be considered as aerosol-limited, whereas for concentrations greater than N op cloud periphery processes, such as enhanced entrainment and evaporation, take over leading to cloud suppression. We show that N op {{is a function of the}} thermodynamic conditions (temperature and humidity profiles). Thus, profiles that favor deeper clouds would dictate larger values of N op, whereas for profiles of shallow convective clouds, N op corresponds to the pristine range of the <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading.</b> Such a view of a trend reversal, marked by the optimal concentration, N op, helps one to bridge the gap between the contradictory results of numerical models and observations. Satellite studies are biased in favor of larger clouds that are characterized by larger N op values and therefore invigoration is observed. On the other hand, modeling studies of cloud fields are biased in favor of small, mostly trade-like convective clouds, which are characterized by low N op values (in the pristine range) and, therefore, cloud suppression is mostly reported as a response to an increase in <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the {{presented}} new Land Daily Aerosol algorithm developed at EUMETSAT is to derive simul-taneously the mean daily tropospheric <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> and the land surface reflectance from MSG/SEVIRI observations. The algorithm {{is based on the}} Optimal Estimation theory, where the forward radiative transfer model explicitly accounts for the surface anisotropy and its coupling with the atmosphere. A priori information on surface reflectance results from its temporal stability. Results of comparisons with AERONET data are presented to validate the modelling approach and the algorithm that resolves the inversion problem...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{characterize}} the different contributions to the <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> in the atmosphere of Buenos Aires {{and the role of}} the atmospheric flow in Southeastern South America as a transport mechanism. The analysis is based on measurements of the columnar aerosol content and derived quantities obtained with ground-based remote sensors. The results provided evidence of the relative importance of the regional transport and the local contribution, as well as elements related with the particulate size distribution and their links with the possible aerosol sources. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{eruption}} of the Mexican volcano El Chichon in April 1982 enhanced the stratospheric <b>aerosol</b> <b>load</b> {{to a level}} which so far has not been observed by remote sensing techniques. The ruby lidar system at Garmisch-Partenkirchen (47. 5 N, 11. 0 E) recorded an increase of integral stratospheric particle backscattering of about two orders of magnitude above the background level of the years 1977 / 78. At northern midlatitudes backscattering was peaking in January/February 1983, as shown in Figure 1. This paper will discuss {{the decline of the}} El Chichon stratospheric perturbation. (IFU...|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} of this review is to summarize our development activities and prospective update strategies for the <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> interface {{since the publication of}} IG 08. The interface connects small-scale CRM simulations to large-scale aerosol transport simulations in a dynamical downscaling framework and complements information about aerosol size distribution spectra. This interface is currently undergoing development in order to couple it with regional models, including a detailed cloud microphysical scheme, referred to as spectral-bin microphysics (SBM; e.g., Khain et al. 2015). Since this paper aims at reviewing the <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> interface in detail, detailed descriptions of SBM are not included. Such descriptions can be found in Khain et al. (2000, 2015), among others.|$|R

The results show that increasing <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> inspires the convective intensity, and then increases the lightning flash density. The spatial distribution of the correlation between <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> and electrical activity shows a remarkable regional difference over China. The high-correlation regions embody the positive aerosol microphysical effect on {{the intensity of the}} electrical activity, while the large-scale processes may play the main role in convection development and producing lightning in low-correlation regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{uncertainty}} in empirical {{estimates of the}} shortwave flux in the Southampton Oceanography Centre (SOC) air-sea flux climatology due to neglect of tropospheric aerosols is investigated. The SOC shortwave flux fields were derived using a formula originally developed from data {{in an area of}} low <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading</b> and do {{not take into account the}} variability of aerosol content over the global ocean. We use the method of Tragou et al. (1999) to estimate the reduction that should be applied in order to correct for the effects of <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading.</b> Our results suggest that the mean global effect of not specifying atmospheric aerosol content is that the SOC shortwave flux is an overestimate, but by no more than 2 Wm- 2. This equates to less than 7 % of the global bias in the original climatology. At a regional level, the effect of the aerosols may be up to 40 Wm- 2 in the tropical Atlantic and the Arabian Sea. Independent measurements of the shortwave flux from research buoys and satellites provide some support for our results. However, further analyses are required as only a few independent buoy measurements are currently available in regions of high <b>aerosol</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|R
