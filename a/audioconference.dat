One particular pedagogical question that research does not provide guidance on teachers’ treatment of during videoconferencing and <b>audioconferencing</b> lessons. This study uses Conversation Analysis to compare lessons conducted by the same teacher-student dyads in audio and videoconferencing. The findings show distinct differences in teachers’ treatment of silence and teachers’ and students’ pausing behaviour in video and <b>audioconferencing.</b> Specifically, teachers tended to wait longer in videoconferencing and took the conversational floor faster in <b>audioconferencing,</b> thus leading to a higher number of overlaps with students’ emergent turns. This suggests that teachers need to be trained for conducting lessons via audio and video conferencing, and that teachers and teacher trainers need to identify specific pedagogical behaviours for each of these contexts. 10 page(s...|$|R

According to preference theory, no response or absence of recipient reaction are understood as dispreferred actions.

40|$|<b>Audioconference</b> {{participants}} {{often have}} difficulty identifying {{the voices of}} other conferees, especially in ad hoc groups of unfamiliar members. Simultaneous presentation of multiple voices through a single, monaural channel can be discordant and difficult to comprehend. To address these shortcomings, we have developed the Vocal Village, a communications tool that allows for real-time spatialized audioconferencing across the Internet. The Vocal Village system uses binaural audio signals to present the voices of individual conference participants from different apparent positions in space by adding location cues to audio information. This paper describes our experimental research {{to determine whether the}} real-time, “within the head, ” spatialization cues implemented by Vocal Village are sufficient to provide performance benefits compared to traditional, monaural audioconferencing methods. Performance benefits included memory, speaker identification, and participant preference.

40|$|Group {{services}} like the <b>audioconference</b> require a minimum level {{of quality of}} service for multicast sessions. This work proposes a new overlay multicast architecture based on SIP extensions and a genetic algorithm. The architecture consists of a SIP Extender client (SE), a Multicast Gateway Agent (MGA) and a Multicast Manager (MM). The SE receives information about the most adequate MGA for it determined by a genetic algorithm inside the MM, then connects the chosen MGA and maintains connection with the MM itself. The genetic algorithm is implemented with JGAP(Java Genetic Algorithm Package) libraries. The SE and MGA are programmed with JainSIP and JainSDP libraries which contain Java structures associated with the SIP protocol and session description. Some experiments over UTP wired and WiFi IEEE 802. 11 n network were performed. Partial results with static and dynamic MGA selection show that, if we compare the joining and leaving time measured inside a station containing SE client programmed with JainSIP and JainSDP libraries versus SJphone proprietary client, the software engineering may have more influence than the medium access method in the response time for a potential group member. Even more, the genetic algorithm at the MM minimizes the response time at great scale...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an iterative signal enhancement algorithm for noise reduction in speech. The algorithm {{is based on}} a truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) procedure, which has already been used as a tool for signal enhancement [1][2].

It can also be extended easily to multiple channels. 1 INTRODUCTION In many speech communication applications, like <b>audioconferencing</b> and hands-free mobile telephony, the recorded and transmitted speech signals contain a considerable amount of acoustic background noise.
