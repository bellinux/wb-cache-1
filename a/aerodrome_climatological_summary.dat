These plans initially included a new crosscutting Task Team on Delayed Mode Voluntary Observing Ship Data (TTDMVOS) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} written to present <b>climatological</b> <b>summaries</b> {{of the wind}} data at the Central Climatology (CC) tower in a {{convenient}} format and to point out some features of the wind speed and direction {{that have not been}} widely appreciated in the past. Short-term (two-week) wind roses provide a means to demonstrate the temporal and spatial relationships that wind speed and direction undergo using a ten-year database from the CC tower. These relationships are best demonstrated by examining the figures provided in this report or looking at loops of computer-generated images provided by the authors...|$|R

40|$|From the Proceedings of the 1975 Meetings of the Arizona Section - American Water Resources Assn. and the Hydrology Section - Arizona Academy of Science - April 11 - 12, 1975, Tempe, ArizonaThe {{universal}} soil loss equation (USLE) {{is widely}} used for estimating annual and individual storm erosion from field-sized watersheds. Records from a single precipitation gage in climatic areas dominated by thunderstorms {{can be used to}} estimate the erosion index (EI) only for the point in question on individual storms or for a specific annual value. Extrapolating the results for more than about a mile leads to serious error in estimating the erosion by the use of the USLE. Short time intervals must be used to obtain an adequate estimate of the EI when using the USLE. The variability of the annual EI can be approximated with a log-normal distribution. All studies indicated that investigations are needed to facilitate estimating the average annual EI from precipitation data as reported by state <b>climatological</b> <b>summaries</b> for states west of the 104 th meridian. Additional work is needed to facilitate estimating the EI value from the precipitation data available in most areas of the southwest where thunderstorms dominate the rainfall pattern...|$|R
50|$|Besides the officially {{documented}} tornadoes, {{several other}} events {{were identified as}} tornadoes by Grazulis in his 1993 documentation. The official <b>Climatological</b> Data National <b>Summary</b> of February 1950 also identified one tornado that, like the others listed below, {{does not appear in}} the archives of the Storm Prediction Center. They are as follows.|$|R
40|$|In the paper, {{medium and}} long term yield {{simulation}} and energy estimation are carried out for conventional tillage and for no-tillage. Analyses were performed by means of forecasting model SALUS. Such software was fed with several data sets: <b>climatological</b> data <b>summaries</b> (since 1990), climate forecasts (from 2011 to 2025), soil characteristics, crops and management techniques for eight different farms involved in the study. For each farm, simulations provided yield {{in the case of}} both conventional and no-tillage. Technical input and yield were converted into energy in order to estimate efficiency. Medium {{and long term}} forecasts reveal how no-tillage can provide a better energy efficiency, with enhanced effects in the long term...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} a {{comprehensive}} solar energy system analysis data base developed by NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center and the University of Alabama is presented, along with its current status. The Marshall Information Retrieval and Data Storage (MIRADS) system was chosen for the data base, and feedback systems were arranged to cope with changes in {{the needs of the}} program management for the type of data gathered. The final structure of the data base consists of 22 files divided into 6 topical sections: <b>summaries,</b> <b>climatological,</b> utility rates, architectural, equipment, and economics. The data base offers help to the solar industry in two ways: it provides information and it serves as a model for users trying to establish the climatic and socioeconomic variables they should take into account when they examine a potential market for solar energy equipment...|$|R
