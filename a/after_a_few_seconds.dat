5|$|The Dive Coaster is a steel {{roller coaster}} {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders experience {{a moment of}} free-falling {{with at least one}} near 90-degree drop. Unlike other roller coasters where the lift hill takes the train directly to the first drop, a Dive Coaster lift hill leads to a flat section of track followed by a holding brake which stops the train just as it enters the vertical drop. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> the train is released into the drop.|$|E
5|$|On 13 October 1990, {{meteoroid}} EN131090, with {{an estimated}} mass of 44kg, entered the Earth's atmosphere above Czechoslovakia and Poland and, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> returned to space. Observations of such events are quite rare; {{this was the second}} recorded using scientific astronomical instruments (after the 1972Great Daylight Fireball) and the first recorded from two distant positions, which enabled the calculation of several of its orbital characteristics. The encounter with Earth significantly changed its orbit and, to a smaller extent, some of its physical properties (mass and structure of its outer layer).|$|E
5|$|Peggy convinces Al to sue {{the motel}} with her and the Rhoades. Steve, not wanting a lawyer to take any of the million dollars he expects to win from the case, decides to act as one for the two families. The case begins with Steve {{presenting}} a lengthy opening statement, during which the stenographer and the judge fall asleep. Next, Steve shows the subpoenaed sex tapes from the motel, despite objections from his wife. After a few hours, the tape runs out and the courtroom applauds Steve and Marcy's romp. Next, Steve shows Peggy and Al's tape, which ends <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds.</b>|$|E
60|$|He must go down {{regardless}} of the many dangers, or return to {{the room where the}} men could murder him whenever they felt so disposed, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>second's</b> reflection he chose the former course.|$|R
60|$|The {{result was}} a {{complicated}} knot; and Mrs Grumbit, <b>after</b> staring <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> at the old gentleman in surprise, said so, and begged to know what use it was of.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} will," [...] Sam said, promptly, <b>after</b> waiting <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> without hearing any reply from Teddy. [...] "Tell {{us what to}} do, an' I'll see to the whole thing." ...|$|R
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of the fourth stage, the level then increments, and the game repeats the stages with progressive difficulty. For example, Donkey Kong begins to hurl barrels faster and sometimes diagonally, and fireballs get speedier. The victory music alternates between levels 1 and 2. The fourth level however, consists of 5 stages with the final stage at 125m. The 22nd level is colloquially known as the kill screen, due to an error in the game's programming that kills Mario <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> effectively ending the game.|$|E
5|$|A {{collision}} with purple enemies is fatal to the character, whereas the green enemies {{are removed from}} the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs {{on either side of}} the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is an action-adventure {{video game}} in which players take {{on the role of}} series protagonist Link through a series of overworlds {{populated}} by monsters and navigating dungeons featuring puzzles and further enemies including dedicated bosses. Link is controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and the Wii MotionPlus expansion device is required to play. The greater majority of gameplay mechanics revolve around use of motion controls: these include camera control with the Nunchuck and general hotkey actions and movement linked to the Wii Remote. Jumping across gaps and scaling ledges happen automatically within context. The Nunchuck is also used to make Link perform a forward roll. In addition to his standard pace, Link can sprint for short distances. Sprinting and other actions such as climbing and carrying heavy objects is limited by a stamina meter, which recharges <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> when not performing actions that drain it. When depleted entirely, Link's movement speed is reduced and he is left vulnerable until the meter refills. Standard navigation takes place from a third-person perspective, while the Dowsing search function switches to a first-person view: Dowsing scans an area for a selected object, with new Dowsing objectives appearing depending on game context.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> {{four men}} lay dead or dying. Three Texas Rangers were {{standing}} nearby, {{but did not}} take part, saying later that they felt Stoudenmire had the situation well in hand.|$|R
6000|$|<b>After</b> meditating <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> Joe Blunt again {{shook his}} head, and muttered to himself; [...] "The boy's bold enough, but he's too {{reckless}} for a hunter. There {{was no need}} for that yell, now--none at all." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{fishermen}} {{turned their}} drunken {{eyes in the}} direction indicated, and, <b>after</b> blinking <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> clearly made out the large blue flag, with its letters MDSF, fluttering in the light breeze that had risen with the sun.|$|R
5|$|At a Nintendo {{press conference}} in Tokyo, Japan on October 5, 2005, the company {{announced}} several games {{that it would be}} releasing in 2006 in Japan. The list included Brain Age 2, with a release date set for December 29, 2005. Nintendo later announced that the game would be released in Europe on June 29, 2007 for €30, and in Australia on July 5, 2007 for A$49.95. The American version of Brain Age 2 was first revealed in May 2007. The game is targeted to casual gamers, similar to its predecessor; its basic concepts stay the same as in , along with the graphics, menu, and presentation. Brain Age 2 also uses the same Sudoku engine, an addition in the original Brain Age that has been applauded for being one of the best handheld Sudoku games available; Brain Age 2s rendition of Sudoku introduces 100 new puzzles. All of the minigames in the game are new to the series; however, some of them are derived from exercises in Brain Age. One of the challenges in the first game, Head Count, requires that the player count how many people are shown on the screen; <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> a house falls on top of them, and then several people leave and enter the house. Afterward, the player must write down how many people they think are still in the house. A variation of this game is available in Brain Age 2, called Memory Sprint, which asks the player to observe a specific sprinter in a race as they pass other sprinters and are passed themselves, and then determine which place they finished in after they cross the finish line. The game's voice recognition technology has improved since the last game. The only challenge that uses the feature, Rock, Paper, Scissors, requires that the player speak the correct answer into the microphone as soon as possible.|$|E
25|$|When {{the cursor}} hovers over a link, {{depending}} on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box, which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.|$|E
25|$|Most level {{crossings}} (Bahnübergang in German, “passage à niveau” in French, “passaggi a livello” in Italian) in Switzerland have two red {{lights on the}} bottom of a triangle backboard, bells, barriers, and more rarely, another triangle with one red light in the middle. When activated, each red light flashes for a third of a second. The bells ring as well. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> the barriers come down and the bells stop ringing. Most Swiss crossings are automatic and a few are also on rack railway systems, so they have rising teeth that come out from the ground.|$|E
50|$|The second attempt {{began with}} another perfect first leg, but the return {{was marred by}} another hard start. Seeing that the engine was badly damaged (although flying), the team {{commanded}} an abort. The module landed back on the pad <b>after</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds.</b>|$|R
60|$|No {{doubt there}} was {{something}} in the stranger's face and attitude which re-assured the Jew, for <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more <b>seconds</b> of anxious hesitancy, he did take the lanthorn from Diogenes' hand and then shuffled back to the street door which he once more carefully barred and bolted.|$|R
60|$|Yeobright {{returned}} to the room without his cousin. When within two or three feet of Eustacia he stopped, as if again arrested by a thought. He was gazing at her. She looked another way, disconcerted, and wondered how long this purgatory was to last. <b>After</b> lingering <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> he passed on again.|$|R
25|$|Swett {{repeatedly}} {{attacked the}} line of dive bombers, downing each in turn with short bursts. He brought down four and was attacking a fifth when his ammunition was depleted {{and he had his}} cockpit shot up by return fire. Wounded, he decided to ditch his damaged fighter off the coast of Florida Island, after it became clear that his oil cooler had been hit and he would not make it back to base. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> his engine seized, and despite initially being trapped in his cockpit underwater, Swett extricated himself and was rescued in Tulagi harbor after ditching his plane. This feat made the 22-year-old Marine aviator an ace on his first combat mission.|$|E
25|$|Less publicized is film shot by British {{television}} cameraman Alan Downes for the British ITN {{news service}} and his Vietnamese counterpart Le Phuc Dinh {{who was working}} for the American television network NBC, which shows the events just before and after the photograph was taken (see image on right). In the top-left frame, a man stands and appears to take photographs as a passing airplane drops bombs. A group of children, Kim Phúc among them, run away in fear. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> she encounters the reporters dressed in military fatigues, including Christopher Wain who gave her water (top-right frame) and poured some over her burns. As she turns sideways, the severity of the burns on her arm and back can be seen (bottom-left frame). A crying woman runs in the opposite direction holding her badly burned child (bottom-right frame). Sections of the film shot were included in Hearts and Minds, the 1974 Academy Award-winning documentary about the Vietnam War directed by Peter Davis.|$|E
25|$|The video {{opens with}} Brandy giving her fictional boyfriend a watch. However, the couple starts to fight <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> leading Brandy {{to drive the}} boyfriend {{to the middle of}} a road and leaving him alone. She then changes her Facebook status to 'Single'. Next, we see Monica giving her lover a new car. The scene then cuts to both having a {{discussion}} on their room, that ends with Monica cutting her boyfriend's necktie with a pair of scissors. The singers are then seen together dressing black leather clothes in a bathroom. As they leave, they carry a MacBook, a golden box and a suit, while placing the items inside the car Monica had previously given her lover. As the lover watches both from afar, Monica and Brandy wave him goodbye. They leave on Brandy's car, as the other explodes in front of Monica's old house. The video ends with a dedication to Whitney Houston. Some of the video shows scenes of Brandy and Monica sitting the same way from Brandy's left and Monica's right with their chairs, Monica singing in the light with a hat and black clothing and later a beret headband from the 70s, Brandy and Monica singing in their dress and signing behind the mirror with the light.|$|E

When Kate, Jack, Hurley and Jin go to the temple to save Sayid, Sawyer asks Miles to remain behind to help bury the now-deceased Juliet and to use his power to find out what she was trying to tell him before she died. He reluctantly agrees, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> tells Sawyer [...] "it worked." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the middle}} of the second chorus, the [...] "funereal brass" [...] is introduced, {{stressing}} the ominous lyrics. After three verses and four choruses, the line [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] is repeated three times, and the song fades out with guitar, cello and swarmandal instrumentation. The song fades back in <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> into the [...] "nightmarish" [...] ending, with the Mellotron playing in a haunting tone – one achieved by recording the Mellotron [...] "Swinging Flutes" [...] setting in reverse – scattered drumming, and Lennon murmuring, after which the song completes.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{most of the}} game, Alyssa has a [...] "Panic Meter" [...] {{visible on}} screen. If she is scared by a Subordinate, {{attacked}} by a spirit or simply frightened by her surroundings, the meter will begin to rise. If it fills, she enters [...] "Panic mode". In this state, the screen starts flashing and Alyssa becomes difficult to control and begins stumbling and falling over. She is also unable to use holy water and cannot enter hiding spots. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> she will momentarily freeze, covering her ears. Panic mode only lasts for {{a certain amount of}} time, and its duration can be reduced by using [...] "Lavender water". However, if she is hit by a Subordinate while in Panic Mode, she will die instantly.|$|E
25|$|In males, the {{beginning}} of the excitement phase is observed when the penis becomes partially erect, often <b>after</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> of erotic stimulation. The erection may be partially lost and regained repeatedly during an extended excitement phase. Both testicles become drawn upward toward the perineum, notably in circumcised males where less skin is available to accommodate the erection. Also, the scrotum can tense and thicken during the erection process.|$|R
50|$|A ploye, {{contrary}} to a pancake, is only cooked {{on one side}} (but some turn it over <b>after</b> for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds).</b> Once cooked, it is buttered, and covered in maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses or cretons. It is then rolled or folded up and eaten. It is also served with the local traditional chicken stew called fricot, which more closely resembles chicken soup with homemade flour dumplings (also called sliders).|$|R

500|$|Tony, Carmela, and AJ {{meet for}} dinner, while the Journey song [...] "Don't Stop Believin'" [...] {{plays in the}} background. The camera cuts away from the Soprano family and {{presents}} vignettes of other diners. As the tension increases, Meadow is shown struggling with parking then crossing {{the street to the}} restaurant. A man, who had been previously shown at the counter specifically taking notice of Tony, is shown entering the restroom, the door of which is directly facing and approximately 90 degrees to the table at which Tony and his family are sitting. As Meadow walks up to the door, the screen goes to Tony. The diner door opens with a bell ringing, Tony looks up and the show smash cuts to black and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> the credits roll in silence.|$|E
500|$|Riders then {{arrive in}} an {{underground}} city named Draconian City, where they battle against Draconians and Archers. Nearing the finale, forward-facing riders see Stansein making his final appearance, following the train. Riders are then confronted by more Draconians and Archers before entering a gold-covered area where King Adelsten's crown is found. Soon after, Ormaar arrives and breathes fire toward the ground. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> the drop track releases the train into a [...] free fall, escaping from Ormaar. As the train leaves the drop track, the trains are rotated {{to their original}} positions {{and all of the}} riders' scores are displayed {{on both sides of the}} track. After turning left into the station, riders disembark and the next riders board. One cycle of the ride lasts approximately three-and-a-half minutes.|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to come to a}} decision, Lois and Peter decide to visit the local {{family-planning}} center, and ultimately decide to abort the embryo. However, as Peter exits the center he encounters an anti-abortion rally, where he is shown an anti-abortion video by one of the protesters. The video causes him to reconsider about aborting the unborn baby. Returning home, Lois continues to advocate her right to choose, while Peter now attempts to argue the unborn child's right to life and whether Lois has the responsibility of carrying it to term. At their wits' end, the two decide to discuss the matter, once and for all. The next day, Lois talks with the family about [...] "the wonderful new member of the Griffin family", but then, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> of silence, Peter turns to the camera and says to the audience [...] "We had the abortion", promptly ending the episode.|$|E
60|$|To {{the first}} {{utterance}} {{of the signal}} no reply was made. <b>After</b> waiting <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> Bounce gave it forth again. Immediately after, the low howl of a wolf was heard on the opposite bank, and a figure appeared {{at the edge of}} the river. Darkness prevented the trapper ascertaining who it was, but a repetition of the cry convinced him that it could be none other than Black Gibault.|$|R
