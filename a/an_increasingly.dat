5|$|<b>An</b> <b>increasingly</b> common {{strategy}} to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site.

Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E
