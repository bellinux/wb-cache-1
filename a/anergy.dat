25|$|Energy {{is neither}} created nor {{destroyed}} during a process. Energy changes from one form to another (see First Law of Thermodynamics). In contrast, exergy is always destroyed when a process is irreversible, for example loss of heat {{to the environment}} (see Second Law of Thermodynamics). This destruction {{is proportional to the}} entropy increase of the system together with its surroundings. The destroyed exergy has been called <b>anergy.</b> For an isothermal process, exergy and energy are interchangeable terms, and there is no <b>anergy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Negative {{selection}} is not 100% effective, some autoreactive T cells escape thymic censorship, and are {{released into the}} circulation. Additional mechanisms of peripheral tolerance active in the periphery exist to silence these cells such as <b>anergy,</b> deletion, and regulatory T cells. If these peripheral tolerance mechanisms also fail, autoimmunity may arise.|$|E
25|$|Deletion or <b>anergy</b> of {{activated}} T-cells follows infection. This {{results from}} production of IL-4 and IL-10 from prolonged {{exposure to the}} toxin. The IL-4 and IL-10 downregulate production of IFN-gamma, MHC Class II, and costimulatory molecules {{on the surface of}} APCs. These effects produce memory cells that are unresponsive to antigen stimulation.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there is}} only a limited {{repertoire}} of antigen that B cells can encounter within the thymus. B cell tolerance then must occur within the periphery after the induction of B cell tolerance within the thymus as a more diverse group of antigens can be encountered in peripheral tissues. This same positive and negative selection mechanism, but in peripheral tissues, is known as clonal <b>anergy.</b> The mechanism of clonal <b>anergy</b> is important to maintain tolerance to many autologous antigens. Active suppression is the other known mechanism of T cell tolerance. Active suppression involves the injection of large amounts of foreign antigen {{in the absence of an}} adjuvant which leads to a state of unresponsiveness. This unresponsive state is then transferred to a naïve recipient from the injected donor to induce a state of tolerance within the recipient.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance is also {{produced}} in T cells. There are also various processes {{which lead to}} B cell tolerance. Just as in T cells, clonal deletion and clonal <b>anergy</b> can physically eliminate autoreactive B cell clones. Receptor editing is another mechanism for B cell tolerance. This involves the reactivation or maintenance of V(D)J recombination in the cell {{which leads to the}} expression of novel receptor specificity through V region gene rearrangements which will create variation in the heavy and light immunoglobulin (Ig) chains.|$|E
25|$|Having {{received}} the first TCR/CD3 signal, the naïve T cell must activate a second independent biochemical pathway, known as Signal 2. This verification step is a protective measure {{to ensure that}} a T cell is responding to a foreign antigen. If this second signal is not present during initial antigen exposure, the T cell presumes that it is auto-reactive. This results in the cell becoming anergic (<b>anergy</b> is generated from the unprotected biochemical changes of Signal 1). Anergic cells will not respond to any antigen in the future, even if both signals are present later on. These cells are generally believed to circulate throughout the body with no value until they undergo apoptosis.|$|E
2500|$|SAg {{production}} effectively corrupts {{the immune}} response, allowing the microbe secreting the SAg {{to be carried}} and transmitted unchecked. One mechanism by which this is done is through inducing <b>anergy</b> of the T-cells to antigens and SAgs. [...] Lussow and MacDonald demonstrated this by systematically exposing animals to a streptococcal antigen. [...] They found that exposure to other antigens after SAg infection failed to elicit an immune response. [...] In another experiment, Watson and Lee discovered that memory T-cells created by normal antigen stimulation were anergic to SAg stimulation and that memory T-cells created after a SAg infection were anergic to all antigen stimulation. [...] The mechanism by which this occurred was undetermined. [...] The genes that regulate SAg expression also regulate mechanisms of immune evasion such as M protein and Bacterial capsule expression, supporting the hypothesis that SAg production evolved primarily as a mechanism of immune evasion.|$|E
2500|$|Activation of CD4+ T cells occurs {{through the}} {{simultaneous}} engagement of [...] the T-cell receptor and a co-stimulatory molecule (like CD28, or ICOS) on the T cell {{by the major}} histocompatibility complex (MHCII) peptide and co-stimulatory molecules [...] on the APC. [...] Both are required for production of an effective immune response; {{in the absence of}} [...] co-stimulation, T-cell receptor signalling alone results in <b>anergy.</b> [...] The signalling pathways downstream from co-stimulatory molecules usually engages the PI3K pathway generating PIP3 at the plasma membrane and recruiting PH domain containing signaling molecules like PDK1 that are essential for the activation of PKCθ, and eventual IL-2 production. Optimal CD8+ T cell response relies on CD4+ signalling. CD4+ cells are useful in the initial antigenic activation of naïve CD8 T cells, and sustaining memory CD8+ T cells in the aftermath of an acute infection. Therefore, activation of CD4+ T cells can be beneficial to the action of CD8+ T cells.|$|E

50|$|Various {{chemicals}} inducing/inhibiting described T {{cell signalling}} pathways {{can be used}} to study the <b>anergy.</b> The <b>anergy</b> in T cells can be induced by Ionomycin, the ionophore capable of raising intracellular concentration of calcium ions artificially.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anergy</b> may {{be taken}} {{advantage}} of for therapeutic uses. The immune response to grafting of transplanted organs and tissues could be minimized without weakening the entire immune system— {{a side effect of}} immunosuppressive drugs like cyclosporine. <b>Anergy</b> may also be used to induce activated lymphocytes to become unresponsive with autoimmune diseases like diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. [...] Likewise, preventing <b>anergy</b> in response to a tumoral growth may help in anti-tumor responses.It might also be used for immunotherapeutic treatment of allergies.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, Ca+II {{chelators}} such as EGTA can sequester Calcium ions {{making them}} unable {{to cause the}} <b>anergy.</b> Blocking of the pathway leading to the <b>anergy</b> can be also done by cyclosporin A, which is capable of inhibiting calcineurin - the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating of NFAT priming its activation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anergy</b> {{is a term}} in {{immunobiology}} {{that describes}} a lack of reaction by the body's defense mechanisms to foreign substances, and consists of a direct induction of peripheral lymphocyte tolerance. An individual {{in a state of}} <b>anergy</b> often indicates that the immune system is unable to mount a normal immune response against a specific antigen, usually a self-antigen. Lymphocytes are said to be anergic when they fail to respond to their specific antigen. <b>Anergy</b> is one of three processes that induce tolerance, modifying the immune system to prevent self-destruction (the others being clonal deletion and immunoregulation).|$|E

50|$|In this manner, the immune-privileged {{property}} {{has served}} {{to work against}} the eye instead. T cells normally encounter self-antigens during their development, when they move to the tissue draining lymph nodes. <b>Anergy</b> is induced in T cells which bind to self-antigens, deactivating them and preventing an autoimmune response in the future. However, the physical isolation of eye antigens results in the body's T cells never having encountered them {{at any time during}} development.Studies in mice have shown that the lack of presentation of eye self-antigens to specific T cells will fail to induce a sufficient amount of <b>anergy</b> to the self-antigens. While the lack of antigen presentation (due to the physical barriers) is sufficient to prevent the activation of autoreactive immune cells to the eye, the failure to induce sufficient <b>anergy</b> to T cells has detrimental results. In the case of damage or chance presentation to the immune system, the antigen presentation and immune response will occur at elevated rates.|$|E

50|$|However, a {{small number}} of the body's army of {{lymphocytes}} are able to react with proteins that are normally present in a healthy body.
