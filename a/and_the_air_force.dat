5|$|Research {{and studies}} were {{initiated}} {{to find a}} safe method to destroy the materials and it was discovered they could be incinerated safely under special conditions of temperature and dwell time. However, these herbicides were expensive <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> wanted to resell its surplus instead of dumping it at sea. Among many methods tested, a possibility of salvaging the herbicides by reprocessing and filtering out the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) contaminant with carbonized (charcoaled) coconut fibers. This concept was then tested in 1976 and a pilot plant constructed at Gulfport.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{to shore}} duty in Washington, he was {{assigned}} to Joint Task Force 2, which was charged by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara with investigating whether it was necessary to have aircraft that could fly at low altitude at supersonic speeds.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Gandhi {{decided to}} promote Manekshaw to the rank of field marshal and {{subsequently}} appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). However, after several objections from the bureaucracy, and the commanders of the navy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>force,</b> the appointment was dropped. It was felt that, as Manekshaw was from the army, as comparatively smaller forces the navy and air force would be neglected. Moreover, bureaucrats felt that it might challenge their influence over defence issues. Though Manekshaw was to retire in June 1972, his term was extended by a period of six months. On 3 January 1973, Manekshaw was conferred with the rank of field marshal at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He was the first Indian army officer to be promoted to the rank.|$|E
5|$|Although the eye feature became {{obscured}} and banding features {{appeared to}} be dissipating six hours after becoming a hurricane, the NHC predicted rapid intensification. As the eye became visible on satellite imagery early on August23, winds increased to 100mph (155km/h), and Fausto became a Category 2 hurricane. Although the convective cloud tops had warmed slightly late that day, wind speeds continued to increase, and intensity estimates made at the University of Wisconsin were as high as 145mph (230km/h), though the National Hurricane Center was in agreement with estimates from all three Dvorak Technique agencies (the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB), the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> Weather Agency (AFWA)), which estimated winds at 115mph (185km/h). Based on this, Hurricane Fausto had intensified into a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E

5|$|Between 1970 and 1975, {{advisories}} for {{systems in}} the eastern Pacific basins were initiated by the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) {{as part of the}} National Weather Service (NWS) office in San Francisco, California. At that time, the advisories released were written in cooperation with the United States Navy Fleet Weather Center in Alameda <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> Hurricane Liaison Officer at the McClellan Air Force Base. Following the move of the hurricane center to Redwood City in 1976, track files were created and altered by Arthur Pike and were later re-modified following the release of a study in 1980. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) extended its authority to the EPHC in 1988, and subsequently began maintaining the tracks.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the planned}} exhibit, {{especially}} those of the American Legion <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> Association, charged that the exhibit focused too much attention on the Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb, {{rather than on the}} motivations for the bombing or the discussion of the bomb's role in ending the conflict with Japan. The exhibit brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings. As a result, after various failed attempts to revise the exhibit {{in order to meet the}} satisfaction of competing interest groups, the exhibit was canceled on 30 January 1995. Martin O. Harwit, Director of the National Air and Space Museum, was compelled to resign over the controversy.|$|E

The committee also said that eventually a single civil agency should be given the power to regulate all air space for all types of aircraft. Furthermore, the committee stated that military flying should be controlled in the vicinity of airways not only in instrument weather, but also in visual conditions.|$|E
