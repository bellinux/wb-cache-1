25|$|Konuma's first {{assignment}} {{as director}} was Call of the Pistil in 1971. Two {{of his most}} popular films-- Flower <b>and</b> <b>Snake</b> <b>and</b> Wife to Be Sacrificed—were made for Nikkatsu in 1974, both with Naomi Tani. Though it was Konuma who brought Oniroku Dan's work to the mainstream through Flower <b>and</b> <b>Snake,</b> the author was reportedly never happy with Konuma's interpretation of his work or the SM genre. The success of Flower <b>and</b> <b>Snake</b> introduced the SM style to Roman Porno films as well as inspiring a Flower <b>and</b> <b>Snake</b> series which ran through the 1970s and returned in the mid-1980s.|$|R

5|$|The adult robin is preyed upon by hawks, cats, <b>and</b> <b>snakes,</b> {{but when}} feeding in flocks, {{it can be}} {{vigilant}} and watch other birds for reactions to predators.

5|$|Bee-eater nests may be raided by rats <b>and</b> <b>snakes,</b> and {{the adults}} are hunted by {{birds of prey}} such as the Levant sparrowhawk. The little {{bee-eater}} and red-throated bee-eaters are hosts of the greater honeyguide and the lesser honeyguide, both brood parasites. The young honeyguides kill the bee-eater's chicks and destroy any eggs. The begging call of the honeyguide sounds like two bee-eater chicks, ensuring a good supply of food from the adult bee-eaters.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began in}} Marrakech, Morocco, on May 4, 1998, and lasted {{seventeen}} weeks; {{the crew had}} to endure dehydration, sandstorms, <b>and</b> <b>snakes</b> while filming in the Sahara.

5|$|Pest {{control is}} at least as old as agriculture, as {{there has always been a}} need to keep crops free from pests. As long ago as 3000 BC in Egypt, cats were used to control pests of grain stores such as rodents. Ferrets were domesticated by 500 AD in Europe for use as mousers. Mongooses were {{introduced}} into homes to control rodents <b>and</b> <b>snakes,</b> probably by the ancient Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|The first amniotes (clade of {{vertebrates}} {{that today}} includes reptiles, mammals, and birds) are {{known from the}} early part of the Late Carboniferous. By the Triassic, this group had already radiated into the earliest mammals, turtles, and crocodiles (lizards and birds appeared in the Jurassic, <b>and</b> <b>snakes</b> in the Cretaceous). This contrasts sharply with the (possibly fourth) Carboniferous group, the baphetids, which have left no extant surviving lineages.|$|E

5|$|The nests of red wattlebirds {{are often}} parasitized by the pallid cuckoo (Cacomantis pallidus), and less {{commonly}} by the Pacific koel (Eudynamys orientalis). Nest predators include the brown goshawk (Accipiter fasciatus), black falcon (Falco subniger), pied currawong, Australian raven (Corvus coronoides), common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), domestic cat, <b>and</b> <b>snakes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the Eleonora's falcon, and eggs and young may be taken by terrestrial predators including stoats <b>and</b> <b>snakes.</b> As {{with other members of}} its genus, the water pipit is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. Eggs of cuckoos that specialise in parasitising pipits are similar in appearance to those of their hosts.|$|E
5|$|According to Renaissance accounts, gigantic, {{triangular}} fossil teeth {{often found}} embedded in rocky formations were once {{believed to be}} the petrified tongues, or glossopetrae, of dragons <b>and</b> <b>snakes.</b> This interpretation was corrected in 1667 by Danish naturalist Nicolas Steno, who recognized them as shark teeth, and famously produced a depiction of a shark's head bearing such teeth. He described his findings in the book The Head of a Shark Dissected, which also contained an illustration of a megalodon tooth.|$|E

5|$|Bears, crocodiles, golden jackals, leopards <b>and</b> <b>snakes</b> are {{the main}} predators of the jungle cat. The golden jackal, particularly, can be a major {{competitor}} to the cat. When it encounters a threat, the jungle cat will vocalise before engaging in attack, producing sounds like small roars – a behavior uncommon for {{the other members of}} Felis. The meow of the jungle cat is also somewhat lower than that of a typical domestic cat. The jungle cat can host parasites such as Haemaphysalis and Heterophyes species.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{maternal}} care they receive, hatchlings commonly fall to predation. While the female is transporting some {{to the nursery}} area, others are picked off by predators that lurk near the nest. The hatchlings {{are a source of}} food for most of the creatures that feed on eggs, and are also subject to aquatic attacks by turtles, fish, <b>and</b> <b>snakes.</b> Birds of prey take their toll, and in any clutch there may be malformed individuals that are unlikely to survive. In northern Australia, the survival rate for saltwater crocodile hatchlings is only twenty-five percent, but with each succeeding year of life this improves, reaching sixty percent by year five. Mortality rates are fairly low among subadults and adults, though they are occasionally preyed on by large cats <b>and</b> <b>snakes.</b> The jaguar and the giant otter may prey on caimans in South America. In other parts of the world, elephants and hippopotamuses may kill crocodiles defensively. Authorities differ as to whether much cannibalism takes place among crocodilians. Adults do not normally eat their own offspring, but there is some evidence of subadults feeding on juveniles and of adults attacking subadults. In Nile crocodiles, rival males sometimes kill each other during the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|During evolution, some {{structures}} {{may lose}} their original function and become vestigial structures. Such structures {{may have little}} or no function in a current species, yet have a clear function in ancestral species, or other closely related species. Examples include pseudogenes, the non-functional remains of eyes in blind cave-dwelling fish, wings in flightless birds, the presence of hip bones in whales <b>and</b> <b>snakes,</b> and sexual traits in organisms that reproduce via asexual reproduction. Examples of vestigial structures in humans include wisdom teeth, the coccyx, the vermiform appendix, and other behavioural vestiges such as goose bumps and primitive reflexes.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are thought}} to be preyed upon by large owls, such as the Madagascar owl (Asio madagascariensis), <b>and</b> <b>snakes</b> like the Malagasy tree boa (Sanzinia madagascariensis). In one case, a family of fork-marked lemurs {{exhibited}} mobbing behavior when they encountered a Malagasy tree boa. Diurnal raptors, such as the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and Madagascar cuckoo-hawk (Aviceda madagascariensis) hunt these lemurs at dusk, and the hunting behavior of the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) suggests it might extract them from their sleeping holes. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) has also been seen attacking fork-marked lemurs, and remains have been found in their scat.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{nuthatch}}es, the white-breasted nuthatch forages for insects on {{trunks and}} branches {{and is able}} to move head-first down trees. Seeds form a substantial part of its winter diet, as do acorns and hickory nuts that were stored by the bird in the fall. The nest is in a hole in a tree, and the breeding pair may smear insects around the entrance as a deterrent to squirrels. Adults and young may be killed by hawks, owls, <b>and</b> <b>snakes,</b> and forest clearance may lead to local habitat loss, but this is a common species with no major conservation concerns over most of its range.|$|E
5|$|More than 16 {{kinds of}} lizards <b>and</b> <b>snakes</b> live in various {{habitats}} {{in the park}} and consume large quantities of insects, spiders, scorpions, other reptiles, and small mammals. The collared lizard, which occurs in every habitat, is the largest and most often seen. Plateau striped whiptails, a species consisting entirely of females, prefer grasslands and developed areas. Side-blotched lizards live in rocky areas of the park but are seldom seen. Gopher snakes, which sometimes imitate rattlesnakes when disturbed, are among the most common snakes in the park. The Western rattlesnake, the only venomous snake found in the park, prefers grasslands and shrub areas.|$|E
