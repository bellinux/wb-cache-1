From October 2012 to April 2013 <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>she</b> planned {{to take time off}} to focus on her health.|$|E
5|$|In Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey, Lohan meets and {{interviews}} victims of human trafficking in Delhi, Kolkata and {{a village in}} West Bengal. They talk about the exploitation and abuse they have experienced, describing sexual slavery, physical abuse and difficulties in bringing their traffickers to justice. She also talks to a former trafficker and parents of trafficked children. One trafficked boy says {{that he can not}} go back home because his mother is ill. A mother who trafficked her daughter describes how her family did not have enough food, and how even though they never received the promised payments for her daughter's work, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> was fed.|$|E
500|$|Geri Halliwell {{described}} the single as a [...] "big love song" [...] and [...] "a Spice Girl classic". Chisholm, in her 2008 appearance on Never Mind The Buzzcocks, commented {{that she thought}} the song was not good at all, and that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> was against the release of any new material when the record company was trying to market the Greatest Hits release. She would later say [...] "Headlines grew on me, it really came in to its own when we toured it, and it really felt lovely on stage".|$|E

50|$|Quickly {{becoming}} a spinster by her culture's standards, she {{is eager to}} escape the community that views her as a failure. After pleading with her parents for permission, she boards a plane bound for the United States and a dream of a career. And although husband-hunting isn't any easier in New York City, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she's</b> got company.|$|R

500|$|Also in 2009 she next co-starred as {{frequent}} flyer Alex Goran, opposite George Clooney, in Jason Reitman's comedy-drama Up in the Air. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Farmiga's performance, {{stating that}} she [...] "is {{one of the}} warmest and most attractive women in the movies, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> plays one". She received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role, BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress, and her second nomination for the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress. On June 25, 2010, she {{was inducted into the}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.|$|E
500|$|Gary Susman of Entertainment Weekly was {{complimentary}} towards Jackson, {{concluding that}} she was [...] "all business, playing it straight" [...] in the episode. He reported that [...] "she makes a fabulous entrance and departs with her dignity intact". Charleston Daily Mail contributor Kevin McDonough wrote that in the season premiere episode [...] "FYI: I Hurt, Too" [...] of season seven, singer Jennifer Lopez appeared [...] "in a farfetched and laugh-free guest appearance. Tonight , it's Janet Jackson's turn. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> has sitcom experience." [...] In her annual countdown of the best quotes of 2004, Amy Amatangelo of Knight Ridder included Will Arnett's line [...] "Like a Sicilian woman's eyebrows, we could not be kept apart". In March 2006, Entertainment Weekly named Jackson's guest spot as their number nine most memorable guest appearance on Will & Grace.|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{was pleased}} that the writers decided to let her {{character}} discover Walter's secret, commenting [...] "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. I {{think that it was}} really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that." ...|$|E

500|$|Robert Hilburn {{from the}} Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "Madonna {{represents}} a contemporary fantasy figure that revives the glamour, innocence and raw sexuality {{of many of}} Madonna's own teen heroes, including Marilyn Monroe and James Dean. Like the early Monroe, Madonna may portray a bimbo, but there she's clearly no pushover. Though the audience was on its feet throughout, it often seemed that Madonna was operating beneath her potential in this pop format. It's important to demonstrate that she can handle herself live, but the simplicity of pop concerts doesn't begin to tax her ambition or talent. In fact, she has so little to do other than express this aggressive, sexy attitude that the show seemed long at just over an hour. Heidi Sherman from Spin commented, [...] "The Virgin Tour was Madonna's first, yet it {{put her in the}} same league as Prince and Bruce Springsteen. It proved that Madonna was beyond real. And if her stage presence indicated she was more showgirl than musician, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> knew how to gussy up her act for the postfeminist MTV age. Boy Toy? Not exactly. She was a bonafide pop star in the process of becoming a cultural icon." ...|$|E
500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} and second unit director David Leitch {{compared it to}} a [...] "Jackie Chan hybrid of comedy and action." [...] Prior to the filming, Leitch organized a month-long boot camp in order to prepare Renner and Arterton (who said she was also glad that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> could use her prior training that she received while studying at RADA) with extensive weapons, fight and stunt training. Janssen said she enjoyed [...] "flying", something that she always wanted to do, adding that despite her reputation as an action star {{it was the first}} film where she really had to do something physical (including suffering a minor accident on the set), because she could not use a double in the close-up scenes where she had the makeup on. During one of the scenes, where Gretel is thrown through a wall and falls down several meters, a stunt double for Arterton was dangerously injured when a nail got lodged in her skull close to the brain; Arterton said she initially wanted to do this stunt herself but Wirkola would not let her. Arterton herself suffered an injury when she sprained her ankle while running through the forest. Stunts for the more aggressive witches were done by New Zealander stuntwoman and actress ZoÃ« Bell. Renner did practically all of his stunt scenes himself.|$|E
500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{compared}} the album unfavorably to In the Zone, saying that although Blackout [...] "scores well, and its hotness quotient is remarkably high, [...] isn't {{much of a}} step forward for Britney following 2003's surprisingly strong In the Zone, for which she received a writing credit on {{a majority of the}} songs (as opposed to a scant three here)." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club said Blackout [...] "counts both as a significant event and as a disquieting aberration that couldn't be more mysteriously manufactured or bizarrely ill-timed" [...] in which [...] "every song counts as markedly progressive and strange." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian called it [...] "a bold, exciting album: the question is whether anyone will be able to hear its contents over the deafening roar of tittle-tattle." [...] He elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall, an artist has two options: making music [...] "that harks back to your golden, pre-tailspin days" [...] to [...] "underlin your complete normality" [...] or [...] "to throw caution to the wind: given your waning fortunes, what's the harm in taking a few musical risks?" [...] Petridis commented that Spears opted for the latter and the results were [...] "largely fantastic." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said, [...] "The electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears's voice is thin, and as the album title suggests, the general mood is bracingly unapologetic." [...] Sanneh added that said Spears became a spectral presence in her own album, explaining that when compared to her previous records, [...] " [...] cuts a startlingly low profile on Blackout [...] Even when she was being marketed as a clean-cut ex-Mouseketeer, and even when she was touring the country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop, something about her was intense." [...] Peter Robinson of The Observer stated that Spears [...] "delivered the best album of her career, raising the bar for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of Timbaland's Shock Value and her own back catalogue." [...] The Phoenixs Ellee Dean said the album [...] "may be more a tribute to the skills of the A-list producers who guided her through the disc than to any of her own talents. But <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> was smart enough to accept that guidance." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and said that [...] "From 'Gimme More's 'It's Britney bitch' hiya to 'Piece of Me's single-of-the-year sonics, from 'Ooh Ooh Baby's 'feel you deep inside' to 'Perfect Lover's 'touch me there', this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked." [...] Blackout was ranked by Rolling Stone at number fifty on their list of the 100 Best Albums of 2007. The album topped Billboards Reader's Choice poll as the best album of the year.|$|E
60|$|There {{was so much}} {{to think}} of, so many plans to be {{considered}} in regard to going back to Barbadoes or staying in Jamaica, that really she could not make up her mind, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> not until <b>she</b> had seen her father. She would be so sorry if Mr. Newcombe came to Spanish Town before her father should arrive, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> before <b>she</b> should hear from him.|$|R

2500|$|According to {{film critic}} Robin Wood Magnani's [...] "persona {{as a great}} actress is built, not on transformation, but on {{emotional}} authenticity... doesn't portray characters but expresses 'genuine' emotions." [...] Her style is notable by not displaying the more obvious attributes of the female star, with neither her face or physical makeup being considered [...] "beautiful". However, she possesses a [...] "remarkably expressive face," [...] and for American audiences, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>she</b> represents [...] "what Hollywood had consistently failed to produce: 'reality'". She was the atypical star, the [...] "nonglamorous human being", as her genuine style of acting became a [...] "rejection of glamour".|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Susan Lucci {{responded to}} a casting call for All My Children. She {{initially}} auditioned {{for the role of}} Tara Martin. The [...] "character that we were all interested in was not Erica, but Tara," [...] said Doris Quinlan, the show's former executive producer. [...] "She was the sweet young ingenue â the one with all the problems that everyone was supposed to care about... I certainly couldn't cast [...] as a young, innocent, sweet little Irish girl. That's not what comes out. She's much more sophisticated â <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> gives that appearance. She was perfect to play Erica." [...] After a meeting with a casting director, they promised to call her back in six months. One of hundreds of people they called back in, Lucci progressed on from each reading of the part until she received the role. [...] "I saw the audition tapes, and she just stood out," [...] said Agnes Nixon. [...] "There was never a question, ever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Emma Frost {{appears in}} Marvel Adventures Spider-Man #53 {{as the best}} friend of mutant Sophia Sanduval, also known as Chat, and mostly uses her powers for {{personal}} gains. She {{is also one of}} the few people who knows Peter Parker's identity as Spider-Man and grows interested in him. She uses her telepathic powers and briefly takes on the alias [...] "The Silencer" [...] to see what Peter is capable of. Chat begins dating Peter afterward. After Chat discovers Emma's schemes, Chat seeks Spider-Man's help, leading to a confrontation between him and Emma. Eventually, Emma confesses her crush on Peter, which she began to have after first looking into his mind and realizing his earnest heroic beliefs and motives. She also reveals that she had caused everything in an attempt to break him and Chat up, feeling that she could neither date Peter while he was with Chat, nor could she spend time with Chat like she used to. By breaking them up, Emma hoped that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> could reclaim Chat's friendship. She makes up with Chat, who still believes her to be good, and allows herself to be arrested, while Peter and Chat go on a date.|$|E

2500|$|Nobody's Daughter was {{released}} on April 26, 2010 worldwide on Mercury Records, and was received by music critics with moderately positive acclaim. Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars, but noted [...] " [...] was an absolute monster vocalist in the nineties, the greatest era ever for rock singers... She doesn't have that power in her lungs anymore â barely a trace. But <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> remembers, and that means something in itself." [...] The magazine also referred to the album as [...] "not a true success", but a [...] "noble effort". Love's voice, which had been noticeably raspier (likely due to years of scream-singing, drug abuse, and smoking) was compared {{to the likes of}} Bob Dylan. NME gave the album a 6/10 rating, and Robert Christgau rated it an [...] "A-", saying, [...] "Thing is, I can use some new punk rage in my life, and unless you're a fan of Goldman Sachs and BP Petroleum, so can you. What's more, better it come from a 45-year-old woman who knows how to throw her weight around than from the zitty newbies and tattooed road dogs who churn most of it out these days. I knowâfor her, BP Petroleum is just something else to pretend about. But the emotion fueling her pretense is cathartic nevertheless." [...] In support of the release, Hole toured extensively between 2010 and 2012 throughout North America and Europe, as well as performing in Japan, Russia, and Brazil.|$|E
