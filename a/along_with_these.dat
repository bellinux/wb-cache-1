Likewise, when Theobald consecrated Gilbert as Bishop of St Asaph in 1142, {{a similar}} profession of obedience was made. <b>Along</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> consecrations, Theobald's legal efforts {{enabled him to}} withstand the attempts of Bernard to turn St David's into an archbishopric, and when Bernard was succeeded by David fitzGerald in 1148, Theobald secured the new bishop's profession of obedience to Canterbury, thus ending the efforts to remove Wales from Canterbury's jurisdiction. Also in 1148, Pope Eugene decided in favour of Canterbury and against the claims of St David's, securing Canterbury's jurisdiction over Wales.|$|E

5|$|The {{settings}} within Tintin {{have also}} added depth to the strips. Hergé mingles real and fictional lands into his stories, {{along with a}} base in Belgium from where Tintin sets off—originally 26 Labrador Road, but later Marlinspike Hall. The role of setting is aptly demonstrated in King Ottokar's Sceptre, in which Hergé creates two fictional countries, Syldavia and Borduria, and invites the reader to tour them in text through the insertion of a travel brochure into the storyline. Other fictional lands include Khemed on the Arabian Peninsula and San Theodoros, São Rico, and Nuevo Rico in South America, {{as well as the}} kingdom of Gaipajama in India. <b>Along</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> fictitious locations, actual nations were employed such as Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, Congo, Peru, India, Egypt, Indonesia, Nepal, Tibet, and China. Other actual locales used were the Sahara, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Moon.|$|E

A fourth Beta process building, 9204-4, was authorized on 2 April 1945 and was completed by 1 December 1945. A new group of Alpha chemistry buildings known as the 9207 group was commenced in June 1944, but work was halted in June 1945 before they were completed. <b>Along</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> main buildings, there were offices, workshops, warehouses and other structures.

5|$|SMP2 {{supports}} {{a trial of}} a special category of bigadv work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive {{and have a great}} scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores, which was raised to sixteen later, on February7, 2012. <b>Along</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as random-access memory (RAM) and Internet bandwidth. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system. The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing clusters and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home. Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Vijay Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.|$|E
5|$|WWE 2K is {{a series}} that has more than 20 {{professional}} wrestling video games that are currently developed by Visual Concepts and Yuke's, and it was originated from THQ but later published by 2K Sports. These series of games {{are based on the}} professional wrestling promotion WWE, which features the professional wrestling match types, storylines, and playable characters based on WWE programming. The series was originally named SmackDown!, after WWE's own SmackDown television program. The first release in the series was WWF SmackDown! in March 2000, which <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> subsequent titles, remained exclusive to Sony's PlayStation consoles. After the brand extension, the series was retitled SmackDown! vs. Raw in 2004, to indicate the Raw brand was also featured. Within a few years!, the series had expanded to a yearly release cycle for various seventh-generation consoles as well as mobile devices. Yuke's had also released the games in Japan under the name of Exciting Pro Wrestling. However, after SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006, THQ took over as the Japanese publisher and the Japanese releases adopted the western name. The series was later renamed as just simply WWE, starting from 2011 and 2012.|$|E
