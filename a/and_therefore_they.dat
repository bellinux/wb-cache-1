5|$|PEV is a {{subcategory}} {{of electric}} vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. Even though conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with power from {{the internal combustion engine}} and regenerative braking, they can not be recharged from an off-vehicle electric energy source, <b>and</b> <b>therefore,</b> <b>they</b> do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Valve {{considered}} {{adding a}} competitive mode to Portal 2. According to Wolpaw, the mode {{was similar to}} the video game Speedball; one team would try to transport a ball {{from one side of the}} playing field to the other using portals, while the other team would attempt to stop them with their own use of portals. Matches would commence with this objective in mind, but quickly descended into chaos. Valve realized that people enjoyed solving puzzles with portals more <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> focused on the cooperative mode.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} eye {{is relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye <b>and,</b> <b>therefore,</b> <b>they</b> are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.|$|E

5|$|Angered by the situation, {{the group}} and their {{supporters}} decide to protest peacefully at India Gate, a war memorial in New Delhi. Police forcefully break up their protest using batons; in the process, Rathod's mother (Waheeda Rehman) is severely injured and slips into a coma. DJ, Karan, Aslam, Sukhi, and Laxman decide that they must emulate the early freedom fighters and resort to violence to achieve justice. As a result, they kill the defence minister to avenge Rathod's death, while Karan murders his father for his corrupt actions. The minister {{is reported to have}} been killed by terrorists and is hailed as a martyr by the media. To bring forth their intentions behind the killings, the five of them attempt to reach the public through a radio station. They forcibly take over the All India Radio station premises after having evacuated its employees. Karan goes on air and reveals the truth about the defence minister and his wrongdoings. While still on the air, the police proclaim that they are dangerous terrorists who have forcefully taken over the AIR, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> are to be shot on sight. The first to be shot is Daljit, who tries to get out of cover and establish that they are not terrorists. Sukhi, unable to control his anger, shows himself and is instantly shot. As they are trying to lock the terrace doors, Aslam and Pandey are then killed by a grenade and the once archenemies die holding hands and smiling, as they have visions of Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan.|$|E

30|$|Boundary value {{problems}} for fractional differential equations {{arise from the}} study of models of viscoelasticity, electrochemistry, control, porous media, electromagnetic, etc. (see [1, 2] <b>and</b> [3]). <b>Therefore,</b> <b>they</b> have received much attention.|$|R
30|$|Chemical {{techniques}} measure {{chemical properties}} of the user's body like body smell or blood glucose, these features are not stable in all conditions <b>and</b> situations <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> are not dependable so much.|$|R
25|$|Hobos and {{migrant workers}} have often used boxcars in their {{journeys}} (see freighthopping), {{since they are}} enclosed <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> cannot be seen by railroad-employed security men ("bulls") or police, {{as well as being}} to some degree insulated from cold weather.|$|E
25|$|However, quite early {{trade and}} crafts demanded more {{practical}} schools. The primitive writing-and-counting schools had their origins here, usually with very mediocre teachers, {{but they were}} very useful <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> flourished, maintained by private support and by the guilds.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all aquifer test {{solution}} methods {{are based on}} the Theis solution; it is built upon the most simplifying assumptions.

25|$|Apollon Limassol did {{not have}} a good enough average (Points per matches) in European Competitions over the {{previous}} five seasons (1989-90 until 1993-94) <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> were not allowed to enter the 1994–95 UEFA Champions League. As a result of this they had to enter the 1994–95 UEFA Cup alongside the second placed team of the league, Anorthosis Famagusta.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{multiplexing}} techniques {{make the}} receivers very complex, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> are typically combined with Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) or with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) modulation, where the problems {{created by a}} multi-path channel are handled efficiently. The IEEE 802.16e standard incorporates MIMO-OFDMA. The IEEE 802.11n standard, released in October 2009, recommends MIMO-OFDM.|$|E
25|$|The Three Oaths are an Aggadic Midrash, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> are not Halakhically {{obligatory}} (Aggadic Midrashim, {{as opposed}} to Halachic Midrashim are not traditionally understood as a valid source for Halacha). Accordingly, Maimonides' Mishne Torah, the Arba'ah Turim, the Shulchan Aruch, and other halachic sources do not cite the Three Oaths or rule accordingly. They are not found there at all.|$|E

25|$|Rice married Jane McIntosh on 19 August 1974, {{the couple}} having met {{while working at}} Capital Radio. The {{marriage}} dissolved in the late 1980s after the British tabloid newspapers revealed {{that he had been}} conducting an affair with actress/singer Elaine Paige. Jane retains the title Lady Rice as, despite obtaining a divorce decree nisi, the couple never made it absolute <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> remain technically married.|$|E
25|$|Wilder {{established}} the Gilda Radner Hereditary Cancer Program at Cedars-Sinai to screen high-risk candidates (such as women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent) and to run basic diagnostic tests. He testified before a Congressional committee that Radner's condition had been misdiagnosed {{and that if}} doctors had inquired more deeply into her family background they would have learned that her grandmother, aunt, and cousin all died of ovarian cancer, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> might have attacked the disease earlier.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} period missionaries faced {{difficulties}} like the depression, World War II, a limited population, and sprawled islands. Much of their time was spent in transportation between islands <b>and,</b> <b>therefore,</b> <b>they</b> did not visit the people from house-to-house as is typical of Mormon missionary work. Instead, they sold mission newspapers, directed plays, held conferences, performed service, and supervised local members. Between 1920 and 1940, 12 chapels were built.|$|E

25|$|In {{various places}} in the Qur'an, it is written that David and King Solomon (Arabic, Suliman or Sulayman) were prophets and kings <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> are revered figures by Muslims. The Medieval pre-Ottoman Hanafi Anatolian beyliks of the Karamanids and Jandarids used the star on their flag. The symbol also used on Hayreddin Barbarossa flag. Even today, the star {{can be found in}} mosques and on other Arabic and Islamic artifacts.|$|E
25|$|Thus, uniforms and/or badges are {{important}} in determining prisoner-of-war status; and francs-tireurs, terrorists, saboteurs, mercenaries, and spies do not qualify {{because they do not}} always follow the laws and customs of war <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> fall under the category of unlawful combatants. In practice, these criteria are rarely interpreted strictly. Guerrillas, for example, usually do not wear a uniform or carry arms openly, but captured guerrillas are often granted POW status.|$|E
25|$|Birth of {{children}} from alien parentage became a problem {{nearing the end of}} the 19th century in controlling population. Gibraltar held the tenet of British law, jus soli, making children of aliens born in Gibraltar British by birth, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> became an irremovable liability to the colony. Residents with temporary work permits could have children in Gibraltar and upset the system of exclusion. Therefore, the British administration devised unique methods to circumvent the tenet of Jus Soli.|$|E
