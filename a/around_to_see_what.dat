2500|$|I {{had taken}} perhaps {{four or five}} steps when I felt that old mill {{building}} quiver. [...] I turned {{and ran for the}} door and stepped out on solid ground, and then turned <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> was going to happen, but folks, it had already happened. [...] The mill wasn't there. [...] I could just see pieces of planking and timbers going over the falls and rushing on down into the valley of Cane Creek below.|$|E
2500|$|... Deukmejian persuaded Shell {{to take a}} seat on the Agricultural Labor Relations Board in 1989, but Shell {{resigned}} {{two years}} later, saying he was embarrassed to be paid for doing almost nothing. It was vintage Joe Shell, a crusty, old-school politician to whom character was more important than ideology. Shell died Monday at his home in Bakersfield – the same day that old enemy Jerry Brown was celebrating his 70th birthday and contemplating another run for the governorship [...] It's too bad Shell won't be <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens." ...|$|E

50|$|Displeased {{with the}} arrangement, a volcano god initiates a massive eruption. After fleeing, the three {{end up on}} yet another beach where Lala chooses George over Harold. An undaunted Harold conjures up Jane Russell from a basket by playing a flute. Alas, she, too, rejects Harold, which means George walks off with both Lala and Jane. A lonesome Harold is left on the beach, {{demanding}} that the film shouldn't finish and asking the audience <b>to</b> stick <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what's</b> going <b>to</b> happen next.|$|R

She'll {{come here}} when I'm milkin', an' ask me {{things about the}} critters an' craps that I knowed when I was a baby. I reckon she's {{the kind of a}} lady that knows all about what's in her line, an' don't know nothin' 'bout what's not in her line. That's the kind of young lady I like. No spyin' <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what's</b> been did, an' what's hain't been did. I've lived with them Bannisters." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now!" [...] shouted Mopsey; {{and then}} the cheers were given with a will that startled the {{officers}} of the ship into looking <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> distinguished passengers they had on board.|$|E
60|$|Tom {{had passed}} {{into the kitchen and}} was looking <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> damage his {{struggle}} with Crabtree had done. Nothing was injured. Under the kitchen table lay a letter and a small vial. He picked up both.|$|E
50|$|Mock Orange aka The Green Record is Mock Orange's second album, {{released}} in 1997 through Minus 7. The band has repeatedly dismissed this album as {{a record that}} they only messed <b>around</b> on <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> they could do.|$|R
50|$|Japanland {{was written}} and filmed by Muller, an American judoka who {{traveled}} to Japan in 2001 to improve her art and realized {{she could not}} succeed without understanding Japan itself, so she {{set out on a}} one-year solo trip <b>around</b> Japan <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> she could.|$|R
5000|$|A Fête Worse Than Death: A Journey {{through an}} English Summer (...) is a travel book by Iain Aitch. It {{was written in}} the summer of 2002 when the author took a trip <b>around</b> England <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> made the English act so strangely in the summer.|$|R
60|$|He now looked <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> else {{he should}} take, {{and thought of}} an umbrella, a rain-coat, a book or two to read during the journey, and several things besides; but he ended by leaving them all behind.|$|E
60|$|Captain Ponsberry {{had just}} {{appeared}} on deck. He had armed {{himself with a}} short club,--a sure sign to {{those who knew him}} that something unusual was in the wind.

60|$|Rollo {{sat down}} {{on one side of}} the sand-garden, and Nathan on the other, and both busied {{themselves}} in digging and building little houses.

6000|$|... "Plain robbing, Miss, that's all. I came {{snooping}} <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> I {{could gather}} up. I thought you wan't to home, seein' as I saw you pull {{out with your}} old man in an auto. I reckon that must a ben your pa, and you're Miss Setliffe." ...|$|E
60|$|The Wizard was delighted, {{and leaped}} from the hollow just as Ruggedo looked <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> {{had become of}} Kiki.

5000|$|According to Mavor, [...] "Mini {{is quite}} a feisty figure; she's the top dog of the school... or at least she likes to think she is. She's witty and she {{definitely}} likes people to hear her opinion. She likes to stir things up, test people and manipulate things <b>around</b> her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> would happen, but I don't think she means to do bad. She doesn't really think {{about the consequences of}} her actions {{a lot of the time}} though." ...|$|R
60|$|At least a {{third of}} the {{distance}} toward the buffaloes was covered when suddenly the herd stopped short. They had heard the dull thud of the horses' hoofs, and now looked <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the sound meant. Then came a wild snorting and throwing of shaggy heads, and away went the herd due west and making the best speed of which their sturdy limbs were capable.|$|E
60|$|You see, the {{combination}} started this way. When I {{got up to}} Redding and had become a doctor, I looked <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> my chances were for aiding in, the great work. The first thing I did was to determine what manner of doctor I was to be. Being a Connecticut farmer, I naturally consulted my farmacopia, and at once {{decided to become a}} farmeopath.|$|E

50|$|Tucker and Jerry {{arrive at}} the party and are told that {{all they have to}} do are greet the guests. They both learn that it's {{actually}} a furry party, and after they are done greeting guests, check <b>around</b> back <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> goes on at that sort of party. They are surprised to find it is a very tame and normal party. Back in the car, they see a police car speeding past, and checking the radio and find that the sixth in a string of robberies occurred, with this one being a bank heist.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Garthwaite {{walked to}} the window when we entered, without saying a word. Determining to let his taciturn humor have its way, I asked him no questions, but looked <b>around</b> the room <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> {{information}} it would give me (and rooms often do give such information) about the character and habits of the owner of the house.|$|R

60|$|The {{vessel was}} dirty, it was ill-appointed; {{there was an}} air of {{reckless}} disorder which showed itself everywhere; but, apart from his evident distaste for dirt and griminess, {{the captain of the}} Revenge seemed to be very well satisfied with everything he saw. When he passed a small gun pointed across the deck, and with a nightcap hung upon a capstan bar thrust into its muzzle, there was such a great laugh that Bonnet looked <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the imprudent Greenway might be doing.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was voted}} that Mr. Turtle {{should never be}} made welcome at Crow's Corner; that he had behaved in an unseemly manner, {{and ought to be}} shunned by every member of the club. This matter had no more than been settled when we heard Master Squirrel {{screaming}} and chattering {{as if he were the}} only real thing in the woods, and as his voice sounded nearer and nearer, telling that he was coming to join the company, I looked <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> had become of the Professor and the 'Squire.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{no use for}} {{me to try to}} {{tell you}} all that was said while every one was so worked up over what I had counted {{was going to be the}} joke of the season. If there were any harsh names which they didn't call Mr. Crow, it was because they were {{forgotten}} in the excitement, and the scolding might have been kept up to this very day if the Professor, hearing the noise, hadn't come snooping <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> he could pick up in the way of table dainties.|$|E

60|$|After {{proceeding}} some distance, Toto, who {{had gone}} on ahead, began to bark loudly. They ran <b>around</b> a bend <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> was the matter and found a man {{sitting on the floor}} of the passage and leaning his back against the wall. He had probably been asleep before Toto's barks aroused him, for he was now rubbing his eyes and staring at the little dog with all his might.|$|R
