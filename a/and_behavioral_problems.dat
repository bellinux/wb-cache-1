40|$|Child {{factors and}} contextual factors collectively {{contribute}} to the development of (externalizing) <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems.</b> Individual cognition <b>and</b> beliefs are of influence on this interplay. The current study focused on the influence of perceived self-competence on the negative relationship between intelligence (as an important child factor) <b>and</b> externalizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems.</b> It was hypothesized that the four aspects of perceived self-competence (cognitive, social, physical and general self-worth) fulfill mediating or moderating roles in the negative relationship between intelligence <b>and</b> externalizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems.</b> The sample consisted of 117 children (27 girls, 90 boys) aged 6 - 14 years old (M = 9. 67, SD = 1. 65). Intelligence was measured using the Total IQ score of the WISC-IIINL, perceived self-competence was measured using the Competentie Belevingsschaal voor Kinderen, <b>and</b> externalizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> were measured using the Externalizing Problem Score of the Teacher’s Report Form. The presence of a negative relationship between intelligence <b>and</b> externalizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> was confirmed through a Pearson correlation (r (116) = -. 524, p <. 001). In addition, a significant, negative association was found between the cognitive aspect of perceived self-competence <b>and</b> externalizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> (r (104) = -. 273, p <. 01). No other associations were found, ruling out the possibility of the aspects of perceived self-competence fulfilling mediating or moderating roles in the relationship between intelligence <b>and</b> externalizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems.</b> However, the results of the current study have led to interesting insights, which can be implemented during the development of specifically targeted interventions in order to reduce externalizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems...</b>|$|R
30|$|A child’s <b>{{behavior}}al</b> <b>problems</b> are {{not clearly}} divided {{and tend to}} appear as interrelated behavior patterns depending on the developmental stage (Kang 2009). Given this, {{it is common to}} use an extensive axis of internalizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> externalizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> (Achenbach <b>and</b> Edelbrock 1983). CBCL 1.5 – 5 (Oh and Kim 2009), a standardized version of Child Behavior Checklist being widely used internationally, is divided into the two axes describing internalizing <b>and</b> externalizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems.</b> Externalizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> include external behavior such as aggressiveness, lying and bullying, mainly or partly caused by a child’s inability to control his or her behavior. As externalizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> can be easily detected in early childhood, numerous studies have examined external <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> as well as related factors. Internalizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems,</b> on the other hand, are less covered in academic research because they involve internal characteristics including loneliness, depression, anxiety, and fear—characteristics that are, in other words, more difficult to detect. Both externalizing <b>and</b> internalizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> are intertwined as they usually occur together (Masten et al. 2006) or influence each other (Gillom and Shaw 2004). Externalizing <b>and</b> internalizing <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> should be considered together because children showing both types of <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> simultaneously are likely to keep experiencing those problems or suffer from mental illness or social maladjustment (Basten et al. 2016; Sourander et al. 2007).|$|R

5|$|The term {{attachment}} {{disorder is}} used to describe emotional <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on {{the age of the}} individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality. No list of symptoms can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of age appropriate social behaviors with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive deficits {{that can}} follow TBI include {{impaired}} attention; disrupted insight, judgement, and thought; reduced processing speed; distractibility; and deficits in executive {{functions such as}} abstract reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and multitasking. Memory loss, the most common cognitive impairment among head-injured people, occurs in 20–79% of people with closed head trauma, depending on severity. People who have suffered TBI may also have difficulty with understanding or producing spoken or written language, or with more subtle aspects of communication such as body language. Post-concussion syndrome, a set of lasting symptoms experienced after mild TBI, can include physical, cognitive, emotional <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> such as headaches, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and depression. Multiple TBIs may have a cumulative effect. A young person who receives a second concussion before symptoms from another one have healed {{may be at risk}} for developing a very rare but deadly condition called second-impact syndrome, in which the brain swells catastrophically after even a mild blow, with debilitating or deadly results. About one in five career boxers is affected by chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI), which causes cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. Dementia pugilistica, the severe form of CTBI, affects primarily career boxers years after a boxing career. It commonly manifests as dementia, memory problems, and parkinsonism (tremors and lack of coordination).|$|E

40|$|Studies have {{suggested}} associations between maternal obesity {{and mental health}} problems of their children. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. A possible mechanism can be via inflammatory states and the other possible mechanism is metabolic hormone-induced programming.

Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the association between fetal adipokine levels <b>and</b> child <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> at preschool age. Cord blood adiponectin, leptin, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL- 6) levels were measured <b>and</b> child <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at preschool age.

40|$|Abstract Background School based {{mental health}} {{programs}} are absent in most educational institutions for intellectually disabled {{children and adolescents}} in Nigeria <b>and</b> co-morbid <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> often complicate intellectual disability {{in children and adolescents}} receiving special education instructions. Little is known about prevalence <b>and</b> pattern of <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> existing co-morbidly among sub-Saharan African children with intellectual disability. This study assessed the prevalence <b>and</b> pattern of <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> among Nigerian children with intellectual disability and also the associated factors. Method Teachers' rated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to screen for <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> among children with intellectual disability in a special education facility in south eastern Nigeria. Socio-demographic questionnaire was used to obtain socio-demographic information of the children. Results A total of forty four (44) children with intellectual disability were involved in the study. Twenty one (47. 7 %) of the children were classified as having <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> in the borderline and abnormal categories on total difficulties clinical scale of SDQ using the cut-off point recommended by Goodman. Mild mental retardation as compared to moderate, severe and profound retardation was associated with highest total difficulties mean score. Males were more likely to exhibit conduct <b>and</b> hyperactivity <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> compared to the females. The inter-clinical scales correlations of teachers' rated SDQ in the studied population also showed good internal consistency (Cronbach Alpha = 0. 63). Conclusion Significant <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> occur co-morbidly among Nigerian children with intellectual disability receiving special education instructions and this could impact negatively on educational learning and other areas of functioning. There is an urgent need for establishing school-based mental health program and appropriate screening measure in this environment. These would afford early identification of intellectually disabled children with <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> appropriate referral for clinical evaluation and interventions.

25|$|Stressful working {{conditions}} {{can lead to}} three types of strains: Behavioral (e.g., absenteeism or poor performance), physical (e.g., headaches or coronary heart disease), and psychological (e.g., anxiety or depressed mood). Physical symptoms that may occur because of occupational stress include fatigue, headache, upset stomach, muscular aches and pains, weight gain or loss, chronic mild illness, and sleep disturbances. Psychological <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> that may develop include anxiety, irritability, alcohol and drug use, feeling powerless and low morale. The spectrum of effects caused by occupational stress includes absenteeism, poor decision making, lack of creativity, accidents, organizational breakdown or even sabotage. If exposure to stressors in the workplace is prolonged, then chronic health problems can occur including stroke. An examination was of physical and psychological effects of workplace stress was conducted {{with a sample of}} 552 female blue collar employees of a microelectronics facility. It was found that job-related conflicts were associated with depressive symptoms, severe headaches, fatigue, rashes, and other multiple symptoms. Studies among the Japanese population specifically showed a more than 2-fold increase in the risk of total stroke among men with job strain (combination of high job demand and low job control). Those in blue-collar or manual labor jobs are more likely to develop heart disease compared to those in white-collar jobs. Along with the risk of stroke, stress can raise the risk of high blood pressure, immune system dysfunction, coronary artery disease. Prolonged occupational stress can lead to occupational burnout. Occupational stress can also disrupt relationships.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Ellis began {{teaching}} his new techniques to other therapists, and by 1957, he formally set forth the first cognitive behavior therapy by proposing that therapists help people adjust their thinking and behavior as {{the treatment for}} emotional <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems.</b> Two years later, Ellis published How to Live with a Neurotic, which elaborated on his new method. In 1960, Ellis presented a paper on his new approach at the American Psychological Association (APA) convention in Chicago. There was mild interest, but few recognized that the paradigm set forth would become the zeitgeist within a generation. At that time, the prevailing interest in experimental psychology was behaviorism, while in clinical psychology it was the psychoanalytic schools of notables such as Freud, Jung, Adler, and Perls. Despite the fact that Ellis' approach emphasized cognitive, emotive, and behavioral methods, his strong cognitive emphasis provoked the psychotherapeutic establishment {{with the possible exception}} of the followers of Adler. Consequently, he was often received with significant hostility at professional conferences and in print. He regularly held seminars where he would bring a participant up on stage and treat them. His own therapeutical style was famed for often being delivered in a rough, confrontational style; however, it should not be confused with his rational-emotive and cognitive-behavioral therapy school that is practiced by his students and followers in a large variety of therapeutic styles (e.g., often depending on client's personality, client's clinical problem, and evidence-based information regarding the appropriate intervention, but also including therapist's own preference).|$|E
25|$|The CASI {{began as}} two {{separate}} measures that {{were developed to}} assist clinicians in obtaining information about youths from their caregivers. Although a variety of checklists were already available, most were not clearly connected to the diagnostic system used by psychiatry and many other professions. The authors saw this need and began to create a symptom checklist in 1984 {{that was based on}} the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Their goal was to obtain information about children who were receiving special education services so that they could assign them into groups based on their learning <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> <b>problems</b> that were more relevant to conventional psychiatric diagnoses (need citation). In this way, the measures helped gather information that helped the clinician form a diagnostic impression. The items also rated the severity of the symptoms. Adding them created a severity score that help guide selection of treatment targets. The original motivation for developing the checklist was to aid with research and gathering of fairly large amounts of data in schools; however, the creators soon saw the possible application of these symptom inventories in clinical settings. To that end, they began work in 1986 on an instrument that would be used by teachers and parents to give a comprehensive look at a youth's emotional and behavioral symptoms. This led to the earliest measure related to the CASI- the Stony Brook Child Symptom Inventory-3 (CSI-3). In 1987 this was followed by the CSI-3R based on the revised third edition of the DSM (DSM-III-R). The CSI-3R included both teacher and parent checklists. The teacher checklist focused on youth behaviors more likely take place in a school setting. In 1990, Dr. Gabrielle Carlson adapted the parent checklist from the CSI-3R for use with adolescents, which became the first version of the Adolescent Symptom Inventory (ASI-3R). After the fourth edition of the DSM was published in 1994, the CSI-4 was developed in response to those changes. The CSI-4 was available in both Spanish and English. In 1995, the ASI was also updated to the ASI-4 to account for modifications in the DSM.|$|E
