40|$|Introduction. Photodynamic {{therapy is}} a two-step procedure, {{involving}} {{the use of}} photosensitizing agents followed by selective illumination of the target lesion with visible light. It produces highly reactive oxygen species and subsequent cellular damage. Objective. This {{study was designed to}} determine whether Leishmania chagasi and L. panamensis promastigotes were sensitive to photodynamic therapy in vitro. Material and methods. Leishmania promastigotes were treated with <b>aluminium</b> phthalocyanine <b>chloride</b> and zinc phthalocyanine photosensitizers before illumination with visible light at 670 nm. The parasite photoactivity was calculated by sigmoidal regression analysis. Results. Leishmania chagasi promastigotes were highly photosensitive to <b>aluminium</b> phthalocyanine <b>chloride</b> treatment with effective inhibitory dose 50 (ED 50) concentration values of 0. 0033, 0. 0083 and 0. 0093 upon exposure to 10. 0, 5. 0, and 2. 5 J/cm 2 light intensities respectively. By contrast, the activity of <b>aluminium</b> phthalocyanine <b>chloride</b> on L. panamensis was significantly lower (P< 0. 01) with ED 50 values of 0. 17, 0. 25, 0. 34 at the same light intensities. Zinc phthalocyanine activity was significantly (P< 0. 01) less active than <b>aluminium</b> phthalocyanine <b>chloride</b> on both strains of these two species and no differences in zinc phthalocyanine activity were found between them. A dose-response phototoxic effect with both phthalocyanines was observed. Parasite inhibition was not observed after <b>aluminium</b> phthalocyanine <b>chloride</b> or zinc phthalocyanine treatment in the dark. The reference drugs hexadecylphosphocholine and amphotericin B were not photoactive. Conclusion. Treatment of Leishmania promastigotes with <b>aluminium</b> phthalocyanine <b>chloride</b> and zinc phthalocyanine followed by illumination with visible light at 670 nm inhibited in vitro growth of promastigotes of L. chagasi and L. panamensis. Photodynamic therapy against Leishmania could be a promising strategy for leishmaniasis treatment...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we report on}} the {{fluorescence}} lifetime characterization of the experimentally prepared Tm-doped silica optical fibers with increased quantum conversion efficiency (QE). Optical fibers were drawn from preforms prepared by conventional solution-doping of thulium and <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorides</b> and by deposition of dispersed alumina nanoparticles with thulium chloride. Prepared preforms and optical fibers were characterized by means of thulium and aluminium concentrations, refractive index profiles, optical spectral attenuations (absorptions) and fluorescence lifetimes. Highly aluminium-codoped optical fiber prepared from alumina nanoparticles exhibited fluorescence lifetime of about 690 µs, which is about 40 % higher compared to the conventionally prepared Tm-doped silica fiber...|$|R

2500|$|Measurement of the emissivities of gases at {{temperatures}} up to 1000°C. Emissivity values were required for gaseous <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorides</b> {{as part of}} the development of the sub-halide distillation process mentioned above. A flowing column of the gas to be measured, heated in a refractory tube, was maintained at a fixed length by gas barriers at each end, formed by balanced opposing streams of argon. [...] The radiation emitted by the gas was measured by a thermopile. A diaphragm was set up to shield this sensor from radiation emitted by the furnace and other hot parts of the equipment. [...] The whole apparatus was mounted on a water-cooled optical bench.|$|R
40|$|A {{fine-grained}} (330 nm) {{yttrium aluminium garnet}} (YAG) ceramic, {{presenting a}} non-negligible transparency (66 % RIT at 600 nm), was obtained by spark plasma sintering. The YAG powder was manufactured by co-precipitation, starting from a yttrium and <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorides</b> solution. A soft precursor was obtained, whose phase evolution was studied by X-ray diffraction. Calcined powders were dispersed by either ball milling or by ultrasonication and then subjected to spark plasma sintering at several temperatures (1200 - 1400 ◦C) and for a reduced time (15 min).

40|$|Yttrium-aluminium garnet (YAG) powders were {{synthesized}} using a reverse-strike precipitation, {{by adding}} an aqueous solution of yttrium and <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorides</b> to dilute ammonia while monitoring the pH to a constant value of 9.

Precipitation and washing procedures were performed at three different temperatures, namely at 5, 25 and 60 ◦C. After drying, the powders {{were characterized by}} DTA/TG simultaneous analysis and then calcined at different temperatures and times.

In this paper, a relevant influence of the coprecipitation temperature on the phases appearance, crystallisation path and final homogeneity of these powders was demonstrated.

5|$|The {{alkylation}} {{reaction is}} more widely used than the acylation reaction, although its practice is more technically demanding because {{the reaction is}} more sluggish. For both reactions, the <b>aluminium</b> <b>chloride,</b> {{as well as other}} materials and the equipment, should be dry, although a trace of moisture is necessary for the reaction to proceed. A general problem with the Friedel–Crafts reaction is that the <b>aluminium</b> <b>chloride</b> catalyst sometimes is required in full stoichiometric quantities, because it complexes strongly with the products. This complication sometimes generates a large amount of corrosive waste. For these and similar reasons, more recyclable or environmentally benign catalysts have been sought. Thus, the use of aluminium trichloride in some applications is being displaced by zeolites.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} acid {{catalyst}} is very important. Bronsted acids such as HCl, H2SO4, polyphosphoric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid {{have been used}} successfully.

40|$|The {{identification}} {{and distribution of}} condensed phase species produced on a graphite platform at temperatures between 200 and 2000 degreesC was studied using data obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive (ED) X-ray spectrometry and Raman microanalysis. The first general conclusion {{is that there is}} no unique path in the thermal transformation of the metal chlorides tested, even for a particular metal chloride. Sodium, potassium and calcium chlorides showed similar vaporization characteristics, evolving mainly as monochlorides, while magnesium, beryllium and aluminium mainly vaporized as free atoms, following transformation caused by hydrolysis. The replacement of chlorine atoms by oxygen occurred at lower temperatures for beryllium and <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorides</b> than for magnesium chloride. There were some particular areas on the platform surface where other mechanisms, such as hydrolysis of calcium chloride and dissociation of sodium chloride in the condensed phase, seemed occasionally to occur to a minor extent.

The reaction between dimethylaluminium chloride and (S) -alpha,alpha-diphenyl- 2 -pyrrolidinyl-methanol (OR* = Dpm) yielded, by contrast, the ionic {[MeAl(OR*) (2) AlMe 2](+) [MeAlCl 3](-) } complex (4). 1 - 4 have been characterised by H- 1,C- 13 and Al- 27 -NMR spectroscopy.

5|$|Iron(III) {{chloride}} has {{a relatively}} low melting point and boils at around 315°C.

5|$|Although cadmium {{usually has}} an {{oxidation}} state of +2, it also {{exists in the}} +1 state. Cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, in {{that they do not}} have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. Cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous cadmium oxide (CdO); the crystalline form of this compound is a dark red which changes color when heated, similar to zinc oxide. Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid dissolve cadmium by forming cadmium chloride (CdCl2), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4), or cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2). The oxidation state +1 can be produced by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and <b>aluminium</b> <b>chloride,</b> forming the Cd22+ cation, which is similar to the Hg22+ cation in mercury(I) chloride.|$|E
5|$|Electrostatic forces between {{particles}} are strongest when {{the charges are}} high, and {{the distance between the}} nuclei of the ions is small. In such cases, the compounds generally have very high melting and boiling points and a low vapour pressure. Trends in melting points can be even better explained when the structure and ionic size ratio is taken into account. Above their melting point ionic solids melt and become molten salts (although some ionic compounds such as <b>aluminium</b> <b>chloride</b> and iron(III) chloride show molecule-like structures in the liquid phase). Inorganic compounds with simple ions typically have small ions, and thus have high melting points, so are solids at room temperature. Some substances with larger ions, however, have a melting point below or near room temperature (often defined as up to 100°C), and are termed ionic liquids. Ions in ionic liquids often have uneven charge distributions, or bulky substituents like hydrocarbon chains, which also play a role in determining the strength of the interactions and propensity to melt.|$|E
