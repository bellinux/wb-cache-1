5|$|Alongside {{the idea}} of the greater Elves, Tolkien also {{developed}} {{the idea of}} children visiting Valinor, the island-homeland of the Elves in their sleep. Elves would also visit children at night <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> them if they had been chided or were upset. This theme, linking elves with children's dreams and nocturnal travelling was largely abandoned in Tolkien's later writing.|$|E

5|$|ILC did {{not produce}} apparel for adults until the {{introduction}} of the Living Girdle in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles that would not tear at the seams if they had a small tear or hole. The Living Girdle was advertised with images of mobility <b>and</b> <b>comfort,</b> such as women playing tennis or leaping while wearing it, though the solid rubber girdle was actually very uncomfortable.|$|E
5|$|In October 1994 a {{large-scale}} modernisation programme was {{started on the}} Stadtbahn. The viaducts were checked and strengthened, and the tracks were bedded in concrete to improve durability <b>and</b> <b>comfort.</b> Almost all stations saw large financial investments and were thoroughly modernised. Long-distance traffic between Zoo and Ostbahnhof stations was interrupted during the construction period and the S-Bahn trains temporarily used the long-distance line.|$|E

5|$|Playtex {{responded by}} litigating. In one suit, it alleged patent {{infringement}} over Pearl's applicator design. It also alleged that advertising claiming Tampax Pearl had better leakage protection <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> than Gentle Glide was false. Playtex won a verdict prohibiting Tampax from making claims of superiority, until {{the decision was}} reversed in 2007, when Tampax made improvements in materials and manufacturing.|$|E

5|$|After the party, Johnny locks {{himself in}} the bathroom, {{prompting}} Lisa to carry out leaving him for Mark. Johnny finally {{comes out of the}} bathroom and retrieves the cassette recorder he attached to the phone and listens to an intimate call between Lisa and Mark.

Mark and Denny blame Lisa for Johnny's death, with Mark abandoning her. Denny asks Lisa and Mark to leave, but they stay <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> one another as the police arrive.|$|E
5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and to the group. Buffy must begin to face her life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support <b>and</b> <b>comfort.</b> The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, the House of Lords {{began to}} use the tower to store its {{parliamentary}} records, building a house alongside it {{for the use of the}} parliamentary clerk, and extensive improvements followed in 1621. The tower continued as the Lords' records office through the 18th century, and several sets of renovations and building work were carried out to improve its fire-proofing <b>and</b> <b>comfort,</b> creating the current appearance of the tower. In 1834, the tower was one of only four buildings to survive a terrible fire in Westminster, and in the aftermath the records were moved to a new, purpose-built archive.|$|E
5|$|Because the Goathouse Refuge offers their 300 cats (number as of January 2013) medical {{treatment}} on-site, quality food, toys <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> {{items such as}} lots of blankets, the cost of maintaining {{is higher than the}} average shelter. Contributors help in many ways to the shelter, including providing items the cats need, donating money, or attending fundraisers. Scarpa's fundraisers use themes such as Burrito Bash, Venetian Carnival, Garden Gourmands, and Mad Hatter's Tea Party. These events are listed in such online and written publications as Raleigh's Indy Week, Chatham County's Chatham Chatlist, Chapel Hill's The Daily Tar Heel {{as well as on the}} Refuge's website and Facebook page.|$|E
5|$|Cadw {{carried out}} a major {{restoration}} project on the house over the next 42 months, combining large scale conservation with detailed surveying and archaeological analysis. The 19th-century Victoria Galley was demolished in 1995, and the bare, external stonework was re-rendered and lime washed. Large parts of the property were restored as they might have appeared in 1665, assisted by the record of Robert Wynn the younger's will, {{with the exception of}} the attic, which was restored to its probable 19th-century appearance. The intention of this was to emphasize the colour <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> of the original building, to prevent it appearing inauthentically bleak and austere. Other sections of the house were redeveloped to hold exhibition displays and other visitor facilities.|$|E

5|$|In April 1999, NSB {{launched}} a new branding scheme for their trains. In addition to Puls for local trains and Agenda for regional trains, the Signatur ("Signature") concept was introduced for intercity trains. Signatur would only be used on the Class 73 services, and consist of two classes, Comfort <b>and</b> <b>Comfort</b> Plus. NSB abolished its branding of only having red trains, and introduced a blue and silver livery on the Class 73 trains. The new service had fewer stops and faster travel times. To {{take advantage of the}} faster speeds, the Norwegian National Rail Administration needed to do upgrades to the track, overhead wires and signaling for NOK1.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|Some top riders receive special frames to {{give more}} {{stability}} <b>and</b> <b>comfort.</b> Different materials make the ride more comfortable. Tom Boonen, using a Time frame with longer wheelbase for the first time, won the race in 2005 and has since continued to use a bike with a longer wheelbase. George Hincapie had a frame featuring a 2mm elastomer insert {{at the top of}} the seat stays. The manufacturers claimed this took nearly all the shock out of the cobbles. Hincapie's Trek bicycle fared less well in 2006: his aluminum steerer tube snapped with 46km to go, the crash injuring his shoulder.|$|E
