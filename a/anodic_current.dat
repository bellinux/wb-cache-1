Single copper particles were fabricated on isolated, thin-film aluminum electrodes to enable independent measurements of excess <b>anodic</b> and cathodic <b>currents</b> flowing during open circuit exposures to dilute aqueous chloride solutions.

Under the experimental conditions explored here, the anodic dissolution {{of aluminum}} beneath the majority of particles was balanced by cathodic reactions on the same electrode. However, excess <b>anodic</b> <b>currents</b> were also observed on some single electrodes due to accelerated dissolution of aluminum beneath the copper particles.

50|$|In cyclic voltammetry, the {{electrode}} potential ramps linearly versus time in cyclical phases (Figure 2). The rate of voltage {{change over time}} during each of these phases {{is known as the}} experiment's scan rate (V/s). The potential is measured between the working electrode and the reference electrode, while the current is measured between the working electrode and the counter electrode. These data are plotted as current (i) versus applied potential (E, often referred to as just 'potential'). In Figure 2, during the initial forward scan (from t0 to t1) an increasingly reducing potential is applied; thus the cathodic current will, at least initially, increase over this time period assuming that there are reducible analytes in the system. At some point after the reduction potential of the analyte is reached, the cathodic current will decrease as the concentration of reducible analyte is depleted. If the redox couple is reversible then during the reverse scan (from t1 to t2) the reduced analyte will start to be re-oxidized, giving rise to a current of reverse polarity (<b>anodic</b> <b>current)</b> to before. The more reversible the redox couple is, the more similar the oxidation peak will be in shape to the reduction peak. Hence, CV data can provide information about redox potentials and electrochemical reaction rates.|$|E

Peaks of <b>anodic</b> <b>current</b> appeared in a wide potential range below the reversible potential for Cu 2 O formation. The width of this potential range strongly depended on the solution alkalinity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for measuring localized corrosion under disbonded coatings {{by means of}} an electrochemical sensor, denoted differential aeration sensor (DAS). It measures the distribution of electrochemical currents over an electrode array surface partially covered by a crevice that simulates a disbonded coating. The DAS has been evaluated using immersion tests at open circuit and under cathodic protection (CP) conditions. Under both conditions, anodic as well as cathodic current densities were detected within the crevice. A fundamental understanding for the detection of <b>anodic</b> <b>currents</b> under CP has been explained in terms of basic electrochemistry. Based on the current distribution data provided by the sensor, two different analysis methods have been used to estimate corrosion and its distribution.

Polished surfaces are covered by a bilayer composed of 3 ̆b 1 -Ni(OH) 2 underlaid by non-stoichiometric NiOx. Below the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential, the air-formed layer mostly reduces to Ni metal and H atoms incorporate deep into the electrode material.
