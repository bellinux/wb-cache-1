5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of the Netherlands, one of van Meegeren’s agents sold the Vermeer forgery Christ with the <b>Adulteress</b> to Nazi banker and art dealer Alois Miedl in 1942. Experts could probably have identified it as a forgery; as van Meegeren's health declined, so did {{the quality of his}} work. He chain-smoked, drank heavily, and became addicted to morphine-laced sleeping pills. Fortunately for van Meegeren, there were no genuine Vermeers available for comparison, since most museum collections were in protective storage as a prevention against war damage. Miedl then sold it to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring for 1.65million guilders ($625,000 or $7million today).|$|E
5|$|A similar tale {{of divine}} {{seduction}} appears in Greek mythology, where Zeus, a king-of-the-gods figure akin to Indra, seduces Alcmene by assuming {{the form of}} her husband, resulting in {{the birth of the}} legendary hero Heracles. Like Ahalya, Alcmene falls victim to Zeus's trickery in some versions or, recognising his true identity, proceeds with the affair in others. The main difference between the tales is that the raison-d'être of Alcmene's seduction is the justification of Heracles's divine parentage, so she is never condemned as an <b>adulteress</b> or punished; in contrast, Ahalya faces the ire of the scriptures as her encounter is regarded as purely erotic (not resulting in procreation).|$|E
5|$|Among Moore's {{releases}} of 1995 were Todd Haynes' drama Safe and the romantic comedy Nine Months, {{in which she}} starred alongside Hugh Grant. The following year she portrayed French painter Dora Maar in the Merchant Ivory film Surviving Picasso opposite Anthony Hopkins and Natascha McElhone. In 1997 Moore portrayed a veteran pornographic actress in Paul Thomas Anderson's drama Boogie Nights—a role that earned her first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also appeared in Steven Spielberg's science fiction adventure sequel —Moore's biggest commercial success to that point. Two years later she played a wartime <b>adulteress</b> in The End of the Affair for which she received her first Academy Award for Best Actress nomination.|$|E

5|$|For {{her role}} as a {{stripper}} in the 2004 romantic drama Closer she received the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress– Motion Picture, and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Two years later Portman portrayed vigilante Evey Hammond in the political thriller V for Vendetta for which she received the Saturn Award for Best Actress. In the same year, she hosted Saturday Night Live. In 2009, she starred as an <b>adulteress</b> in The Other Woman, which she also executively produced. In 2010, Portman's performance as a mentally tortured ballerina in Darren Aronofsky's psychological thriller Black Swan garnered her the Academy Award for Best Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture– Drama, and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to the Netherlands in September 1939 as the Second World War threatened. He remained {{at a hotel in}} Amsterdam for several months and moved to the village of Laren in 1940. Throughout 1941, van Meegeren issued his designs, which he published in 1942 as a large and luxurious book entitled Han van Meegeren: Teekeningen I (Drawings nr I). He also created several forgeries during this time, including The Head of Christ, The Last Supper II, The Blessing of Jacob, The <b>Adulteress,</b> and The Washing of the Feet—all in the manner of Vermeer. On 18 December 1943, he divorced his wife, but this was only a formality; the couple remained together, but a large share of his capital was transferred to her accounts as a safeguard against the uncertainties of the war.|$|E
5|$|In Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka's Telugu rendition, Ahalya is {{depicted}} as a romantic <b>adulteress.</b> When Brahma creates Ahalya as the most beautiful being, she {{falls in love with}} Indra and longs for him, but Brahma grants her to Gautama. After Ahalya's marriage, Indra too craves for her. He frequently visits her and flirts with her in Gautama's absence. At one point, Ahalya receives a visit from Indra's female messenger, who proceeds to mock husbands who avoid sex by saying {{that it is not the}} right day for pleasure. Ahalya protests, maintaining that she imagines Gautama to be Indra as they have sex and that a woman should be a stone, forgoing all thought of sexual gratification. That night, when Ahalya longs for conjugal bliss, Gautama refuses her, saying that she is not in her fertile period. Agitated, she wishes that Indra was there to satisfy her. Indra perceives her wish and comes in Gautama's disguise, but is revealed by his seductive speech. Ignoring the deception, Ahalya joyously makes love to him.|$|E

5|$|Maria {{quickly learned}} of her husband's true character. She {{tried to ignore}} him by {{cultivating}} a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce {{are discussed in the}} novel and Maria seems to take his words as inspiration rather than the warning they are meant to be. After Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an <b>adulteress,</b> Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.|$|E
5|$|Originally Mary {{believed}} that many nobles supported her marriage, but things soon turned sour between the newly elevated Bothwell (created Duke of Orkney) {{and his former}} peers, and the marriage proved to be deeply unpopular. Catholics considered the marriage unlawful, since they did not recognise Bothwell's divorce or {{the validity of the}} Protestant service. Both Protestants and Catholics were shocked that Mary should marry the man accused of murdering her husband. The marriage was tempestuous, and Mary became despondent. Twenty-six Scottish peers, known as the confederate lords, turned against Mary and Bothwell, raising an army against them. Mary and Bothwell confronted the lords at Carberry Hill on 15 June, but there was no battle as Mary's forces dwindled away through desertion during negotiations. Bothwell was given safe passage from the field, and the lords took Mary to Edinburgh, where crowds of spectators denounced her as an <b>adulteress</b> and murderer. The following night, she was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle, on an island in the middle of Loch Leven. Between 20 and 23 July, Mary miscarried twins. On 24 July, she was forced to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old son James. Moray was made regent, while Bothwell was driven into exile. He was imprisoned in Denmark, became insane and died in 1578.|$|E

Lepidus, Agrippina and Livilla were accused of being lovers. Not much is known concerning this plot and the reasons behind it.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that ascites was seen as a punishment especially for oath-breakers among the Proto-Indo-Europeans.

This angel {{is one of the}} seven that had the seven last plagues to execute upon the man of sin (Rev 21:9), and yet he saith the measure is {{according}} to {{the measure of}} a man; the meaning is that the city, the New Jerusalem, is to be built according to the word of Christ; but yet by his word {{as it is in the}} hand of his angels, that is, his messengers and servants; of which servants, the chief will be those that are his instruments to pour forth the seven vials full of the seven last plagues upon the Antichristian harlot. For they, with their plagues, will both destroy what standeth in implacable opposition, and will subject the rest, and bring them into a correspondency with the word and will of God, as I have showed. Whence note, that they of his servants that God shall use to pour forth his last and most dreadful plagues upon the whore, they are they that God will use to show us the pattern of this holy city. Or thus, they that can tell how to plague the whore, they can tell how to measure this city. 'The righteous men, they shall judge them,' that is, the Antichristian harlot, with her wicked and adulterous daughters, 'after the manner of <b>adulteresses,</b> and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are <b>adulteresses,</b> and blood is in their hands' (Eze 23:45).|$|R

25|$|Harvard scholar Karen King {{writes that}} more of the many women who contributed to the {{formation}} of Christianity in its earliest years are becoming known.

Further movies directed by Stuhr are Big Animal ( [...] , 2000 - based on a Kieślowski screenplay), and Tomorrows Weather ( [...] , 2003). For these two, Stuhr employed the Polish alternative rock band Myslovitz who composed the title tracks and also had walk-on roles in the latter.

25|$|The {{erroneous}} {{belief that}} Mary Magdalene was an <b>adulteress,</b> {{the wife of}} Jesus, and a repentant prostitute {{can be traced back}} {{at least as far as}} the fourth century. Because of that opinion's acceptance in an influential homily of Pope Gregory the Great in about 591 the historical error became the generally accepted view in Western Christianity. In his homily, the Pope mistakenly identified Magdalene not only with the anonymous sinner with the perfume in Luke's gospel, but also confused her with Mary of Bethany, the sister of Martha and Lazarus. Karen King concludes that the discoveries of new texts by biblical scholars, combined with their sharpened critical insight, have now proved beyond any doubt that the disreputable portrait of Mary Magdalene is entirely inaccurate.|$|E
25|$|Guinevere {{has been}} portrayed as {{everything}} from a weak and opportunistic traitor to a fatally flawed but noble and virtuous gentlewoman. In Chrétien de Troyes's Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, she is praised for her intelligence, friendliness, and gentility, while in Marie de France's Lanval (and Thomas Chestre's Middle English version, Sir Launfal), she is a vindictive <b>adulteress,</b> disliked by the protagonist and all well-bred knights. Early chronicles tend to portray her inauspiciously or hardly at all, while later authors use her good and bad qualities to construct a deeper character who played a larger role. The works of Chrétien {{were some of the}} first to elaborate on the character Guinevere beyond simply the wife of Arthur. This was likely due to Chrétien's audience at the time, the court of Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, which was composed of courtly ladies who played highly social roles.|$|E
25|$|An 'Old Latin' {{version of}} Tatian's Syriac text {{appears to have}} {{circulated}} in the West from the late 2nd century; with a sequence adjusted to conform more closely {{to that of the}} canonical Gospel of Luke; and also including additional canonical text (such as the pericope of the <b>adulteress),</b> as well, possibly, as non-canonical matter from the Gospel of the Hebrews. With the gradual adoption of the Vulgate as the liturgical Gospel text of the Latin Church, the Latin Diatessaron was increasingly modified to conform to Vulgate readings. In 546 Victor of Capua discovered such a mixed manuscript; and, further corrected by Victor so as to provide a very pure Vulgate text within a modified Diatessaron sequence and to restore the two genealogies of Jesus side-by-side, this harmony, the Codex Fuldensis, survives in the monastic library at Fulda, where it served as the source text for vernacular harmonies in Old High German, Eastern Frankish and Old Saxon (the alliterative poem 'Heliand'). The older mixed Vulgate/Diatessaron text type also appears to have continued as a distinct tradition, as such texts appear to underlie surviving 13th–14th century Gospel harmonies in Middle Dutch, Middle High German, Middle French, Middle English, Tuscan and Venetian; although no example of this hypothetical Latin sub-text has ever been identified. The Liège Diatessaron is a particularly poetic example. This Latin Diatessaron textual tradition has also been suggested as underlying the enigmatic 16th century Islam-influenced Gospel of Barnabas (Joosten, 2002).|$|E
6000|$|Second, As they that {{depart from}} iniquity {{withdraw}} {{their minds and}} affections from the lusts and motions of it, so they depart also from the OCCASIONS of it; there are occasions by which sin worketh to bring forth the fruits thereof, and some seek those occasions.

Such a man as will keep far from an evil matter will not company with a person that pollutes and defiles, nor will he come near {{the door of the}} <b>adulteress's</b> house; he will shun profane and vain babbling, for fear of the ungodliness that attends it; he will walk with wise men that he may be wise, knowing that 'a companion of fools shall be destroyed.'

50|$|Based on Biblical texts, such as James 4:4 (“Ye adulterers and <b>adulteresses,</b> know ye {{not that}} the {{friendship}} {{of the world is}} enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.”) and 1 John 2:15-16 (“Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.”), the Unamended see the world as fundamentally evil and in contrast to God’s will. Therefore, baptized members see themselves as “strangers and pilgrims on earth”(Heb 11:13) and preach a degree of separatism from the world at large. This is not a monastic view, but attempt to prefer biblical study and fellowship over the offerings of the world.|$|R
60|$|Ans. In many ages {{indeed it}} hath been so: but mark, they {{appeared}} not such, when first they were received unto communion (Exo 12:48), neither were they with God's liking, as such, to be retained among them, {{but in order}} to their admonition, repentance and amendment of life: of which, if they failed, God presently threatened the church; and either cut them off from the church, as he did the idolators, fornicators, murmurers, tempters, sabbath breakers; with Korah, Dathan, Achan, and others (2 Cor 6; 1 Cor 5; Exo 32:25; Num 25:1-9, 21:5,6, 14:37, 16, 15:32-36; Josh 7; 2 Kings 17; Eze 22, 23) or else cut off them with the church and all, as he served the ten tribes at one time, and the two tribes at another. 'My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations' (Hosea 9:17). I might here greatly enlarge, but I intend brevity; yet let me tell you, that when Nehemiah understood by the book of the law of the Lord, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God: 'They separated from Israel all the mixed multitude' (Neh 13:1-3). Many have pleaded for the profane, that they should abide in the church of God; but such hath not considered, that God's wrath at all times hath with great indignation been shewed against such offenders and their conceits. Indeed they like not for to plead for them under that notion, but rather as Korah, and his company: 'All the congregation are holy every one of them' (Num 16:3). But it maketh no matter by what name they are called; if by their deeds they shew themselves openly wicked: for names and notions sanctify not the heart and nature; they make not virtues of vice, neither can it save such advocates from the heavy curse both of God and men (Prov 17:15, 24:24).
