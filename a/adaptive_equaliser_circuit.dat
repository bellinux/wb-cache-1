40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{influence}} of oversampling on a filter bank based transmultiplexer, for which previous research has established oversampling as a useful mean to ease synchronisation. The effect of oversampling is assessed mainly in terms of inter-symbol interference due to synchronisation errors and due to the residual time-dispersive effect of the transmission medium after transmultiplexing. Both effects can be targetted by a fractionally spaced equaliser. Although the achievable minimum mean square error is lower for higher oversampling ratios, we show by example of a powerline communications channel that slow convergence of least mean square type <b>adaptive</b> <b>equalisers</b> prohibits the exploitation of this benefit. Together with considerations on bandwidth efficiency and peak-to-average power ratio, it is advantageous to keep the oversampling ratio as small as possible...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a FIR <b>adaptive</b> <b>equaliser</b> for {{impulse noise}} {{suppression}} is proposed. It {{is based on}} the minimization of an M-estimate objective function which has the ability to ignore or down-weight a large error signal when it exceeds certain thresholds. An advantage of the proposed method is that its solution is governed by a system of linear equations, called the M-estimate normal equation. Therefore, traditional fast algorithms like the recursive least squares algorithm can be applied. Using a robust estimation of the thresholds and the recursive least square algorithm, an M-estimate RLS (M-RLS) algorithm is developed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has better convergence performance than the N-RLS and MN-LMS algorithms when the input signal of the equaliser is corrupted by individually or consecutive impulse noises.

40|$|Abstract — Wideband CDMA {{systems with}} {{orthogonal}} spread-ing codes suffer severely {{due to the}} loss of orthogonality by multipath propagation. This yields Multiple User Interference (MUI) which gravely reduces the performance of classical systems with Rake-receivers. In our approach we attempt to restore orthogonality again by using a Lattice equaliser. These kind of equalisers are composed of two parts. The prewhitening part and the <b>adaptive</b> <b>equaliser</b> part. The Lattice structure itself has the advantage that its backward prediction errors are orthogonal to each other. Therefore the Lattice structure itself is working as a prewhitening filter. The second part is the adaptive algorithm for the equaliser coefficients. We take the stochastic gradient algorithm for this task and use the pilot channel in UMTS as a reference to calculate the equaliser coefficients. In order to show the feasibility of this approach, some simulation results for channels with low Doppler frequencies are presented and compared with the a system using the classical Rake-receiver and a system with another prefilter approach, the LMS-like Griffith equaliser [1].

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} adaptive channel equalisation in environments where the interfering noise exhibits non–Gaussian behaviour due to impulsive phenomena. The family of alpha-stable distributions {{has proved to be}} a suitable and flexible tool for the modelling of signals with impulsive nature. However,non–Gaussian alpha–stable signals have infinite variance, and signal processing techniques based on second order moments are meaningless in such environments. In order to exploit the flexibility of the stable family and still take advantage of the existing signal processing tools, a novel framework for the integration of the stable model in a communications context is proposed, based on a finite dynamic range receiver. The performance of traditional signal processing algorithms designed under the Gaussian assumption may degrade seriously in impulsive environments. When this degradation cannot be tolerated, the traditional signal processing methods must be revisited and redesigned taking into account the non–Gaussian noise statistics. In this direction, the optimum feed–forward and decision feedback Bayesian symbol–by–symbol equalisers for stable noise environments are derived. Then, new analytical tools for the evaluation of systems in infinite variance environments are presented. For the centers estimation of the proposed Bayesian equaliser, a unified framework for a family of robust recursive linear estimation techniques is presented and the underlying relationships between them are identified. Furthermore, the direct clustering technique is studied and robust variants of the existing algorithms are proposed. A novel clustering algorithm is also derived based on robust location estimation. The problem of estimating the stable parameters has been addressed in the literature and a variety of algorithms can be found. Some of these algorithms are assessed in terms of efficiency, simplicity and performance and the most suitable is chosen for the equalisation problem. All the building components of an <b>adaptive</b> Bayesian <b>equaliser</b> are then put together and the performance of the equaliser is evaluated experimentally. The simulation results suggest that the proposed <b>adaptive</b> <b>equaliser</b> offers a significant performance benefit compared with a traditional equaliser, designed under the Gaussian assumption.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the design of}} new <b>adaptive</b> <b>equalisers</b> for fading digital communication channels. The role of equalisation is discussed {{in the context of}} the functions of a digital radio communication system and both conventional and more recent novel equaliser designs are described. The application of recurrent neural networks to the problem of equalisation is developed from a theoretical study of a single node structure to the design of multinode structures. These neural networks are shown to cancel intersymbol interference in a manner mimicking conventional techniques and simulations demonstrate their sensitivity to symbol estimation errors. In addition the error mechanisms of conventional maximum likelihood equalisers operating on rapidly time-varying channels are investigated and highlight the problems of channel estimation using delayed and often incorrect symbol estimates. The relative sensitivity of Bayesian equalisation techniques to errors in the channel estimate is studied and demonstrates that the structure's equalisation capability is also susceptible to such errors. Applications of multiple channel estimator methods are developed, leading to reduced complexity structures which trade performance for a smaller computational load. These novel structures are shown to provide an improvement over the conventional techniques, especially for rapidly time-varying channels, by reducing the time delay in the channel estimation process. Finally, the use of confidence measures of the equaliser's symbol estimates in order to improve channel estimation is studied and isolates the critical areas in the development of the technique — the production of reliable confidence measures by the equalisers and the statistics of symbol estimation error bursts...|$|R

The problem of scaling in the RNS is then presented, with reference to using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and Mixed Radix Conversion (MRC) as a means of implementing this operation. While certain modular operations can be performed in a fast manner, other operations, including scaling and sign detection are much more complex. Recent developments in the last decade are also presented such as the QRNS and the PRNS. Common filtering structures are introduced for fixed and adaptive filtering, which include biquad sections, lattice structures and the LMS algorithm. A novel use of the RNS allows for almost halving the scaling time. This new method can be used with a number of common filtering structures and algorithms. A new property of the CRT is also used to implement the new scaling algorithm.

Q 2 PSK constitutes a relatively new modulation technique, {{and the application of}} adaptive equalisation to this technique has not yet been considered in the open literature. This dissertation represents an in depth study into the Q 2 PSK modulation technique, as well as the optimal implementation, in simulation, of such a modem to aid the inclusion of the adap¬tive lattice DFE, for application to high speed mobile digital communication over the V /UHF channel in the presence of multi path propagation. Specific aspects of synchronization applicable to this modem platform are also addressed. An in depth study was also conducted into the realisation of a V /UHF channel simulation, capable of producing a Ricean and/or Rayleigh fad¬ing multipath propagation environment for the evaluation of the modem platform and <b>adaptive</b> <b>equaliser</b> structure. The theoretical analysis of the effect of multi path on a Q 2 PSK signal led to the correct design of the adaptive lattice structure, as well as the correct interfacing of the equaliser to the receiver platform. The performance of the proposed synchronisation strategies, in tandem with the equalisation technique were evaluated for several static, as well as fading multipath channels. The simulation results obtained show the equaliser operates correctly, and can give large performance gains over the static matched filter (matched to the transmitted waveform) implementation of the modem platform.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis is concerned with detection, estimation techniques and a method of the adaptive adjustment of the equaliser, {{for use in a}} 4800 bit/sec synchronous digital transmission system operating over a voice-band time-varying HF channel. Two main impairments are additive Gaussian noise and inter-symbol interference (ISI), which can be very severe at times. All techniques considered here are algorithms or processes that operate on sequences of sample values. Modern digital modems normally operate in this way, and the techniques described are of direct application to practical systems, and could be implemented using the new technology of high speed real-time digital signal processing (DSP). The performance of the various systems that employ the above techniques are obtained using the computer simulated model of three types of HF channels. The ionospheric propagation medium, the characteristics of HF channel and the signal distortion introduced by the channel are first described. The thesis then presents a suitable base-band model of the HF channel for computer simulation of quadrature amplitude modulation systems. A suitable method for the adjustment of the receiver is described next. This method is suitable both for the adjustment of a conventional decision feedback equaliser (DFE), and also for the adjustment of a linear feedforward filter that is employed ahead of a near-maximum likelihood (NML) detector. This method uses a minimum phase (root-finding) algorithm (MPA) to convert the channel response from being non-minimum phase to at least approximately minimum phase. The results of computer simulation tests of this algorithm are then presented over different types of HF channel models. The results demonstrate the algorithm's capability to make the channel response minimum (or near-minimum) phase. Various NML detectors, derived from the Viterbi detector, are discussed. Each detector is here preceded by an adaptive linear filter that is adjusted adaptively using an MPA. The performance of these detectors is compared with the conventional DFE, whose tap-gains are adjusted adaptively using an MPA, and the detector which gives the best compromise between performance and complexity is selected for combined receivers. These results are obtained using perfect estimation of the channel response. The estimation techniques studied in this thesis include both new and conventional estiniators, which are based on the least- mean-square (LMS) algorithm or recursive least-square(RLS) algorithm. The estimator provides an estimate of the sampled impulse response (SIR) of the channel, necessary for the NML detector or MPA. The performances of these estimators are compared using computer simulation tests. The results also demonstrate that the simpler LMS algorithm with adaptive step size gives a comparable level of accuracy with the more complex RLS algorithm. Finally the most promising of the detectors and estimators are connected with an <b>adaptive</b> <b>equaliser,</b> using an MPA, to form a new combined receiver. The details of the combined system structure with its computational complexity are given. Extensive computer simulation tests have been carried out on the different arrangements of the combined system including DFE, when all the functions of detection, estimation and MPA are present, in order to find the most cost effective system in terms of performance and complexity. A considerable reduction in the equipment complexity can be achieved by allowing a long period between successive adjustment of the adaptive filter and estimator...|$|R
