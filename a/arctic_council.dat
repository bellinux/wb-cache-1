It was one of the founders of the environmental <b>Arctic</b> <b>Council</b> in 1996. The US military bases on the island remain a major issue, with some politicians pushing for renegotiation of the 1951 USDenmark treaty by the Home Rule government.

40|$|The work in {{this report}} is a {{contribution}} from CICERO to Theme 4 of the NorACIA project, a Norwegian follow-up to the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Council’s</b> <b>Arctic</b> Climate Impact Assessment: [URL] It has been recognized {{that there is an}} urgent need for better and integrated knowledge of the social, economic and environmental conditions that underpin vulnerability to climate change at the local level. Such knowledge is necessary in order to develop credible vulnerability and adaptation assessment methodologies that can in turn inform local, regional and national planning processes and adaptation strategies. We examine two indicators of socio-economic vulnerability to climate change in climate- sensitive sectors in Northern Norway: share of employment and gross value added. Using these two indicator examples, we show that vulnerability to climate change in different economic sectors varies depending on the scale at which analysis is undertaken, the unit of analysis and the indicators employed. Given the identified limitations of applying a top-down approach to assessing socio-economic vulnerability, we suggest elements of a strengthened methodology for vulnerability studies that incorporates stakeholders’ own information on their exposure-sensitivities and adaptive capacity to climate change. We conclude that a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches for assessing the vulnerability of climate-senstitive sectors is waranted...|$|R

Although improving water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) has been a focus of the United Nations for decades, the Arctic region has received little attention in this regard. A growing body of evidence highlights inequalities across the region for the availability of in-home drinking WASH services and for health indicators associated with these services. In this review, we highlight relevant data and describe an initiative through the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Council's</b> Sustainable Development Working Group to characterize the extent of WASH services in Arctic nations, the related health indicators and climate-related vulnerabilities to WASH services. With this as a baseline, efforts to build collaborations across the Arctic will be undertaken to promote innovations that can extend the benefits of water and sanitation services to all residents. 1 U 38 OT 000143 - 03 /OT/OSTLTS CDC HHS/United States 27132632 PMC 485220...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 This study {{relies on}} social science {{research}} on the causal mechanisms of capacity improvement to assess multilateral, environmental interventions in the Russian Arctic. The case studies reveal the occasions wherein target linking, commitment making, behavioral influence, and knowledge production played significant roles in influencing Russian institutions to take sustainable, environmental action. This theoretical basis enables {{an assessment of the}} <b>Arctic</b> <b>Council’s</b> unique use of knowledge production as a mechanism of influence. This assessment is achieved through a case study in the Council’s first and only major intervention into the Russian Arctic, the National Program of Action (NPA). Unlike other Council programs that coordinate multilateral research, the NPA tried to intervene directly into Russian policy-making by transferring the knowledge it generated into recommended regulations. However, none of these draft laws were ever passed. The study concludes that Russia accepts new environmental commitments, adapts its environmental targets, and acts on new knowledge when doing so intersects candidly with interests that are connected to Russian economics and defense...|$|R
5000|$|However {{prominent}} {{the role}} of indigenous peoples, the Permanent Participant status does not confer any legal recognition as peoples. The Ottawa Declaration, the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Council's</b> founding document, explicitly states (in a footnote): [...] "The {{use of the term}} 'peoples' in this declaration shall not be construed as having any implications as regard the rights which may attach to the term under international law." [...] Incidentally, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 13 September 2007 after 22 years of negotiations, was rejected by Canada and the United States, while Russia abstained. Both the United States and Canada have their origins as colonies of the United Kingdom and have large non-indigenous immigrant majorities and small indigenous populations. This means that most Arctic indigenous people were not covered by the rights laid out in the declaration. In November 2010, Canada officially endorsed the declaration and in December of that year President Obama declared the United States would sign the declaration.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of evidence-based international {{strategies for the}} conservation and management of Arctic ecosystems {{in the face of}} climate change is hindered by critical knowledge gaps in Arctic floristic diversity and evolution. Particularly poorly studied are the bryophytes, which dominant the vegetation across vast areas of the Arctic, and consequently, {{play an important role in}} global biogeochemical cycles. Currently, much of what is known about Arctic floristic evolution is based on studies of vascular plants. Bryophytes, however, possess a number of features, such as poikilohydry, totipotency, several reproductive strategies, and the ability to disperse through microscopic diaspores, which may cause their responses to Arctic environments to differ from those of the vascular plants. Here we discuss several priority areas identified in the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Council's</b> ‘Arctic Biodiversity Assessment’ that are necessary to illuminate patterns of Arctic bryophyte evolution and diversity, including dispersal, glacial refugia, local adaptation, and ecological interactions within bryophyte-associated microbiomes. A survey of digitally available herbarium data archived in the largest online aggregate, GBIF, across the Arctic to boreal zones, indicates that sampling coverage of mosses is heterogeneous, and relatively sparse in the Arctic sensu stricostricto. A coordinated international effort across the Arctic will be necessary to address knowledge gaps in Arctic bryophyte diversity and evolution in the context of ongoing climate change...|$|R
40|$|Regional Environmental Publications 389 The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme, AMAP {{is one of}} the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Council’s</b> four {{environmental}} programmes. The task of AMAP is {{to monitor}} and assess the levels and effects of anthropogenic pollutants in all components of the Arctic environment, including the human population. The population living in the Arctic areas is in many areas dependent on the ecosystem of their environment and its food chains. Developing offspring either in the foetal state, as newborns, or in the growing phase are the most sensitive to environmental pollutants. As a result, the targeted group in the AMAP human health project is expecting mothers and their newborn. A newborn infant is the final destination for fat-soluble environmental toxins. The following studies of mothers blood and cord blood of the newborn in Northern- and Eastern Lapland were conducted: mercury, lead, cadmium, selenium, zinc, copper, 15 different polychlorinated biphenyl compounds (PCB congeners), and 11 pesticides or persistent organic pollutants (POP) were measured. Arsenic and nickel were analysed from the maternal and newborn urine. The exposure to environmental pollutants was calculated by assessing the use of food stuffs of mothers. The levels of toxic substances and calculated supply of them were low and no health risk was found. Some deficiencies in nourishment were found...|$|R

The Faroes, a non-sovereign actor, have undertaken more responsibility from Denmark and taken a more active role within international relations as a consequence of Danish and Faroese interests being distinct within many fields. Lately the cooperation in the WNC has increased and the focus has been on the <b>Arctic.</b> The <b>Council</b> has put forward visions for the forthcoming future which are in coherence with Faroese interests. The Council seeks to influence international affairs which are affecting the West Nordic region and creating both challenges and opportunities for the three countries, that have strong relational ties connected through similarities in remoteness, fisheries and culture. Through the use of theories and concepts of small states, regionalism and institution an analysis has been made based on six themes created from eleven qualitative interviews. As a case study it goes in to depth with the cooperation in the West Nordic Council and seeks to understand its uniqueness and complexity.
