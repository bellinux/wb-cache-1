5|$|Novisuccinea chittenangoensis survives in <b>and</b> <b>presumably</b> prefers cool, {{partially}} sunlit {{areas of}} lush herbaceous growth within the spray {{zone of the}} Falls.|$|E
5|$|The tammar wallaby {{is listed}} as Least Concern by the IUCN, because of its {{abundance}} <b>and</b> <b>presumably</b> stable population. However, the fragmentation of its range has led to high amounts of inbreeding and morphological abnormalities in some populations.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the Red Triangle Circus Gang and The Penguin's {{right-hand}} man. He carries an organ grinder as his main weapon. He survives all three attacks on Gotham City, but is captured <b>and</b> <b>presumably</b> interrogated by Batman during the Penguin's final attempt to take over Gotham City.|$|E
50|$|Archaeological discoveries {{indicate}} significant {{human presence}} here both during the later Neolithic period <b>and</b> subsequently. <b>Presumably</b> the district {{shared in the}} switch from a nomadic hunting existence to one involving settlement <b>and</b> agriculture. <b>Presumably,</b> too, the area {{had its share of}} fighting and conquest.|$|R

50|$|It {{probably}} {{lives in}} xerophytic vegetation <b>and</b> is <b>presumably</b> an egg-laying species.|$|R
5|$|By August 3, Colonel Warren {{concluded}} the entire effort was futile and dangerous. The unprotected sailors were stirring up radioactive material and contaminating their skin, clothing, <b>and,</b> <b>presumably,</b> their lungs. When {{they returned to}} their support ship living quarters, they contaminated the shower stalls, laundry facilities, and everything they touched. Warren demanded an immediate halt to the entire cleanup operation. He was especially concerned about plutonium, which was undetectable on site.|$|E
5|$|Observed in this species, the wing-fluttering {{display is}} seen in several situations: females responding, <b>and</b> <b>presumably</b> acquiescing, to male {{courtship}} displays, juveniles begging for food, by helpers to older birds, and immature males to senior ones. The fairywren lowers its head and tail, outstretches and quivers its wings and holds its beak open silently.|$|E
5|$|Persian satraps (<b>and</b> <b>presumably</b> their armies) {{were not}} to travel west of the Halys River (Isocrates) or closer than a day's journey on horseback to the Aegean Sea (Callisthenes) or closer than three days' journey on foot to the Aegean Sea (Ephorus and Diodorus).|$|E

5|$|Romanus (died before 627) was {{the second}} bishop of Rochester <b>and</b> <b>presumably</b> {{was a member of}} the Gregorian mission sent to Kent to Christianize the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism. Romanus was consecrated bishop around 624 and died before 627 by drowning. Little is known of his life beyond these facts.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to single}} interstitials, divacancies {{do not produce}} photoluminescence. Divacancies, in turn, anneal out at ~900°C {{creating}} multivacancy chains detected by EPR <b>and</b> <b>presumably</b> hexavacancy rings. The latter should be invisible to most spectroscopies, and indeed, {{they have not been}} detected thus far. Annealing of vacancies changes diamond color from green to yellow-brown. Similar mechanism (vacancy aggregation) is also believed to cause brown color of plastically deformed natural diamonds.|$|E
5|$|Sulfur {{deposits}} {{generated from}} hydrothermal alteration are found on Cerro Tuzgle. They are mostly {{associated with the}} Azufre synthem and were previously mined on the southern, eastern and western flanks of the volcano. The mines are now abandoned. Arsenic {{is also found in}} the groundwater <b>and</b> <b>presumably</b> comes from Tuzgle.|$|E
50|$|A {{corruption}} of the given names Marcos <b>and</b> Juana, <b>presumably</b> {{the founders of the}} settlement.|$|R

5|$|The olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis, {{has been}} found to have photoreceptors in the skin of its tail, {{allowing}} it to detect light <b>and</b> <b>presumably</b> ensuring it is completely hidden, including its tail, inside coral holes during the day. While other species have not been tested, Aipysurus laevis possibly is not unique among sea snakes in this respect.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} {{has a very}} large range of 5.9millionkm2 (2.29millionsqmi). The total {{population}} is unknown, but the bird is described as very common in Jordan and common in Egypt. It has an expanding range and increasing population. Its large range <b>and</b> <b>presumably</b> high numbers mean that the pale crag martin is {{not considered to be}} threatened, and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} has been hunted for its body parts {{for use in}} {{traditional}} medicine, for amusement, and for sport, though this is rare, as the species is generally not considered attractive. There is fossil evidence of humans in Middle Pleistocene Europe butchering <b>and</b> <b>presumably</b> consuming spotted hyenas. Such incidences are rare in modern Africa, where most tribes, even those known to eat unusual kinds of meat, generally despise hyena flesh.|$|E
50|$|Species in {{this family}} infect the {{gastrointestinal}} tract <b>and</b> are <b>presumably</b> transmitted by the orofaecal route.|$|R

5|$|Another of Donnchadh's sons, Eóin (John), {{owned the}} land of Straiton. He was {{involved}} in the Galwegian revolt of Gille Ruadh in 1235, during which he attacked some churches in the diocese of Glasgow. He received a pardon by granting patronage of the church of Straiton and {{the land of}} Hachinclohyn to William de Bondington, Bishop of Glasgow, which was confirmed by Alexander II in 1244. Two other sons, Ailean (Alan) and Alaxandair (Alexander), are attested subscribing to Donnchadh and Cailean's charters to North Berwick. A Melrose charter mentions that Ailean was parson of Kirchemanen. Cailean, <b>and</b> <b>presumably</b> Donnchadh's other legitimate sons, died before their father.|$|E
5|$|Cavaldi {{stays in}} the village and joins the villagers for the feast. Angelika kisses both the Grimms and tells them that they are always welcome at the village. The Brothers Grimm decide to pursue a new profession, presumably {{recording}} fairy tales, although they are now wanted criminals of the state. One of the Queen's crows is seen flying off with the last shard of her mirror, still holding the Queen's watchful eye <b>and</b> <b>presumably,</b> her living soul.|$|E
5|$|Chemically, scandium, yttrium and {{lutetium}} (<b>and</b> <b>presumably</b> lawrencium) {{behave like}} trivalent {{versions of the}} group 1–2 metals. On the other hand, trends going down the group for properties such as melting point, electronegativity and ionic radius, {{are similar to those}} found among their group 4–8 counterparts. In this variant, the number of f electrons in the gaseous forms of the f-block atoms usually matches their position in the f-block. For example, the f-electron counts for the first five f-block elements are La 0, Ce 1, Pr 3, Nd 4 and Pm 5.|$|E
50|$|After the Roman {{defeat at}} Adrianople, Sauromaces was {{probably}} expelled in 378 <b>and</b> Aspacures <b>presumably</b> regained the whole kingdom.|$|R
50|$|Heemann et al. {{reported}} two {{adverse events}} most probably MARS related: fever <b>and</b> sepsis, <b>presumably</b> originated at the catheter.|$|R

5|$|Late LTP is {{induced by}} changes in gene {{expression}} and protein synthesis {{brought about by the}} persistent activation of protein kinases activated during E-LTP, such as MAPK. In fact, MAPK—specifically the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subfamily of MAPKs—may be the molecular link between E-LTP and L-LTP, since many signaling cascades involved in E-LTP, including CaMKII and PKC, can converge on ERK. Recent research has shown that the induction of L-LTP can depend on coincident molecular events, namely PKA activation and calcium influx, that converge on CRTC1 (TORC1), a potent transcriptional coactivator for cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). This requirement for a molecular coincidence accounts perfectly for the associative nature of LTP, <b>and,</b> <b>presumably,</b> for that of learning.|$|E
5|$|Most {{probably}} born in Warwickshire, Catesby {{was educated}} in nearby Oxford. His family were prominent recusant Catholics, <b>and</b> <b>presumably</b> to avoid swearing the Oath of Supremacy he left college before taking his degree. He married a Protestant in 1593 and fathered two children, {{one of whom}} survived birth and was baptised in a Protestant church, but in 1598, following the deaths {{of his father and}} his wife, he may have reverted to Catholicism. In 1601 he took part in the Essex Rebellion but was captured and fined, after which he sold his estate at Chastleton.|$|E
5|$|Neon's {{abundance}} {{in the universe}} is about 1 part in 750; in the Sun <b>and</b> <b>presumably</b> in the proto-solar system nebula, about 1 part in 600. The Galileo spacecraft atmospheric entry probe found {{that even in the}} upper atmosphere of Jupiter, the abundance of neon is reduced (depleted) by about a factor of 10, to a level of 1 part in 6,000 by mass. This may indicate that even the ice-planetesimals which brought neon into Jupiter from the outer solar system, formed in a region which was too warm to retain the neon atmospheric component (abundances of heavier inert gases on Jupiter are several times that found in the Sun).|$|E
