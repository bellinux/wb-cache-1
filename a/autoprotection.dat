40|$|Prior {{administration}} of a moderately hemolytic dose of 2 -butoxyethanol (2 -BE) in rats leads to <b>autoprotection</b> against the lethal effects of high doses. Digavalli and Mehendale (Arch. Toxicol. 69 : 526 - 532; 1995) showed that this <b>autoprotection</b> {{was due to}} recovery from the prior episode of hemolysis resulting in {{a higher proportion of}} young red blood cells (RBCs), which are more resilient to 2 -BE. The objective of this research was to investigate the hypothesis that <b>autoprotection</b> can be entirely explained in terms of such changes in age composition of the RBC population. A simple simulation model was developed to provide predictions of the effect of various 2 -BE dosage regimes, which were then experimentally verified. Some model predictions were confirmed by the experiments, but others were distinctly off the mark. The longer sequences (two or three successive episodes) in particular showed unexpected erythropoietic responses. This was further investigated in additional experiments, which also looked at reticulocyte counts and serum levels of erythropoietin (Epo). These showed that the release of reticulocytes following a 2 -BE challenge is considerably faster than one would expect from the normal processing time in the bone marrow, and also becomes stronger at each successive challenge, resulting in remarkably high levels of reticulocytosis. It is concluded that changes in age composition of the RBCs cannot fully explain the time course of the hematocrit during consecutive {{administration of}} several doses of 2 -BE, and that other mechanisms must play an important role as well. The results seem to indicate that after the hematocrit has recovered a buffer of (almost mature) reticulocytes remains available in the bone marrow for several days, which can be released almost immediately when another decrease in hematocrit is evoked...|$|E
40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} in all physiotherapeutically {{oriented}} procedures of naturotherapy - such as helio-, climate-, thalasso- or hydrotherapy or certain forms of physical exercise - the transient expression of stress-proteins (heat-shock proteins, HSPs) is {{an important element of}} salutogenesis. These therapeutical procedures all cause a transitory 'disturbance' by an unspecific stressor that leads to functional responses. These functional responses can be trained and thus increase the forces and the capacity for resistance of the organism. The autoprotective mechanisms which we want to deal with in more detail are based on the functions of the heat-shock proteins (HSPs, stress-response proteins, 'chaperones') and represent archaic autoprotective responses. In addition, more complex mechanisms of <b>autoprotection</b> seem to have evolved that {{may play a role in}} the natural defenses against disease and which show a hierarchy of various genomically conserved strategies with different time-constants and time windows. This becomes apparent by studying autoprotective responses of the cardiovascular system of warm-blooded animals under ischemic stress. Recent extensive experimental protocols and clinical observations in elucidating the molecular basis of cardiac ischemia show that powerful autoprotective mechanisms are involved in the phenomena of 'hibernation', 'stunning', and 'ischemic preconditioning'. The system of the heat-shock proteins may therefore be regarded as a basic model for the principle of <b>autoprotection</b> and salutogenesis...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} rodent models of hepatoprotection have been {{developed}} in which tolerance to acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity occurs. Autoprotection/heteroprotection is a phenomenon where prior exposure to a mildly toxic dose of toxicant confers protection against a subsequently administered higher dose of the same toxicant (as {{in the case of}} <b>autoprotection)</b> or to a different toxicant (referred to as heteroprotection). Multiple mechanisms regulate this adaptive response, including hepatocellular proliferation, proteostasis, enhanced expression of cytoprotective genes, and altered tissue immune response. In this review, we will discuss recent findings that highlight the complexity of these adaptive mechanisms and we also outline the usefulness of these findings to devise therapeutic and/or diagnostic tools for acetaminophen-induced liver damage in patients...|$|E
40|$|Treatment with hepatotoxicants such as {{acetaminophen}} (APAP) causes {{resistance to}} a second, higher {{dose of the}} same toxicant (<b>autoprotection).</b> APAP induces hepatic mRNA and protein levels of the multidrug resistance-associated proteins (Mrp) transporters in mice and humans. Basolateral efflux transporters Mrp 3 and Mrp 4 are the most significantly induced. We hypothesized that upregulation of Mrp 3 and Mrp 4 is one mechanism by which hepatocytes become resistant to a subsequent higher dose of APAP by limiting accumulation of xeno-, endobiotics, and byproducts of hepatocellular injury. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate Mrp 3 and Mrp 4 expression in proliferating hepatocytes in a mouse model of APAP <b>autoprotection.</b> Plasma and livers were collected from male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice treated with APAP 400 mg/kg for determination of hepatotoxicity and protein expression. Maximal Mrp 3 and Mrp 4 induction occurred 48 h after APAP. Mrp 4 upregulation occurred selectively in proliferating hepatocytes. Additional groups of APAP-pretreated mice were challenged 48 h later with a second, higher dose of APAP. APAP-pretreated mice had reduced hepatotoxicity after APAP challenge compared to those pretreated with vehicle. A more rapid recovery of glutathione (GSH) in APAP-pretreated mice corresponded with increases in GSH synthetic enzymes. Interestingly, mice pretreated and challenged with APAP had dramatic increases in Mrp 4 expression as well as enhanced hepatocyte proliferation. Inhibition of hepatocyte replication with colchicine not only restored sensitivity of APAP-pretreated mice to injury, but also blocked Mrp 4 induction. Mrp 4 overexpression may be one phenotypic property of proliferating hepatocytes that protects against subsequent hepatotoxicant exposure by mechanisms that are presently unknown...|$|E
40|$|The present {{trend in}} the {{industry}} is towards the use of power transistors {{in the development of}} efficient Pulsewidth Modulated (PWM) inverters, because of their operation at high frequency, simplicity of turn-off, and low commutation losses compared to the technology using thyristors. But the protection of power transistors, minimization of switching power loss, and design of base drive circuit are very important for a reliable operation of the system. The requirements, analysis, and a simplified procedure for calculation of the switching-aid network components are presented. The transistor is protected against short circuit using a modified autoregulated and <b>autoprotection</b> drive circuit. The experimental results show that the switching power loss and voltage stress in the device can be reduced by suitable choice of the switching-aid network component values...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The role of {{intracellular}} Ca 2 + in CCl 4 hepatotoxicity in rats was clarified {{by measuring}} detailed changes in serum ALT values and intracellular Ca 2 + after CCl 4 administration. Intracellular Ca 2 + responded to CCl 4 intoxication with a biphasic increase. The first intracellular Ca 2 + peak increased up to 5. 6 -fold the control level at 1 hour, {{and the second}} Ca 2 + peak 6. 5 -fold at 3. 5 days. We further {{examined the effects of}} drugs on serum ALT activity and intracellular Ca 2 + in rats administered at 1 hour prior to or 3 hours after CCl 4 administration. The results showed that the first Ca 2 + increase might be attributable to a signal arising from the extent of hepatic injury. The second Ca 2 + increase might act to activate cellular protective functions. We discussed that sustained intracellular Ca 2 + increases may be involved in <b>autoprotection,</b> namely susceptibility against a toxication...|$|E
40|$|Acetaminophen {{overdose}} is {{the leading}} cause of acute liver failure. One dose of 10 - 15 [*]g causes severe liver damage in humans, whereas repeated exposure to acetaminophen in humans and animal models results in <b>autoprotection.</b> Insight of this process is limited to select proteins implicated in acetaminophen toxicity and cellular defence. Here we investigate hepatic adaptation to acetaminophen toxicity from a whole proteome perspective, using quantitative mass spectrometry. In a rat model, we show the response to acetaminophen involves the expression of 30 % of all proteins detected in the liver. Genetic ablation of a master regulator of cellular defence, NFE 2 L 2, has little effect, suggesting redundancy in the regulation of adaptation. We show that adaptation to acetaminophen has a spatial component, involving a shift in regionalisation of CYP 2 E 1, which may prevent toxicity thresholds being reached. These data reveal unexpected complexity and dynamic behaviour in the biological response to drug-induced liver injury...|$|E
40|$|Drug-induced liver injury impairs {{hepatobiliary}} function {{and results in}} altered disposition of xenobiotics. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} gene and protein expression of hepatobiliary transporters is altered in response to chemical-mediated hepatotoxicity. The work presented in this dissertation includes a comprehensive temporal characterization of mRNA and protein expression for mouse uptake and efflux transporters in response to acetaminophen and carbon tetrachloride exposure. In general, a hepatotoxic dose of acetaminophen or carbon tetrachloride decreased mRNA and protein levels of uptake transporters (organic anion transport proteins, Oatps, and sodium-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide, Ntcp) and increased levels of efflux transporters (multidrug resistance-associated proteins, Mrps) coordinately with detoxification, stress and antioxidant enzymes. Induction of Mrp 3 and Mrp 4 occurred in centrilobular hepatocytes, and Mrp 4 staining localized primarily to proliferating cells. Administration of a second higher dose of acetaminophen to mice when Mrp 3 and Mrp 4 levels and hepatocellular regeneration were maximal resulted in lower hepatotoxicity or <b>autoprotection.</b> Livers from protected mice demonstrated marked increases not only in hepatocyte proliferation but also Mrp 4 protein far beyond those seen after a single dose of acetaminophen. Inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation blocked acetaminophen <b>autoprotection</b> and also diminished induction of Mrp 4. It is hypothesized that upregulation of Mrp 4 is a protective response to minimize accumulation of potentially toxic chemicals in hepatocytes and may also be a mechanism for paracrine signaling within the liver during recovery from injury. ^ Work in this dissertation also investigates regulatory factors underlying transporter regulation during liver injury. Previous data demonstrate that increased expression of detoxification and antioxidant genes in mice exposed to acetaminophen is mediated by the transcription factor, NFE 2 -related factor 2, Nrf 2. Experiments were designed to investigate whether up-regulation of Mrp mRNA and protein after acetaminophen was dependent on Nrf 2 expression. The results showed that induction of Mrp 3 and Mrp 4 mRNA and protein is absent in Nrf 2 knockout mice suggesting that Nrf 2 signaling is critical for regulation of these two transporters during APAP toxicity. These findings provide insightful information on the regulation of hepatobiliary transporter expression in mice during drug-induced liver injury. Further studies are necessary to establish the functional consequences of altered transporter levels during hepatotoxicity. ...|$|E
40|$|Mice pretreated {{with a mild}} {{toxic dose}} of {{acetaminophen}} (APAP) acquire resistance to a second, higher APAP dose. This phenomenon is termed APAP <b>autoprotection</b> and the exact mechanism by which such resistance develops is not clearly known. Given the prevalence of APAP-hepatotoxicity and the human health impact of this potentially hepatotoxic agent, a further understanding of the mechanism(s) involved in such protection are of considerable significance and could lead to new modalities of treatment of acute drug-induced liver injury. The work presented in this thesis investigates FMO 3 gene expression during APAP-induced liver injury {{as well as the}} functional significance of FMO 3 over-expression during APAP-induced liver injury. Furthermore, FMO 3 gene regulation during oxidative stress conditions is also examined. Acetaminophen treatment resulted in up-regulation of liver Fmo 3 protein in male mice. Female mice express higher liver Fmo 3 than males and are highly resistant to APAP hepatotoxicity. Inhibition of Fmo 3, by methimazole, renders female mice susceptible to APAP-induced liver injury. These findings are suggestive of a protective function for Fmo 3. In addition to APAP, ANIT and BDL also increase Fmo 3 gene expression in mice. Because these hepatotoxicants also induce oxidative stress, we also investigated the potential role of the oxidative stress sensor and transcription factor, NRF 2, in FMO 3 gene regulation. Both in vivo and in vitro results show that transcriptional regulation of FMO 3 might not involve the NRF 2 -KEAP 1 regulatory pathway. Human liver can adapt to APAP-induced hepatotoxicity similar to our APAP <b>autoprotection</b> mouse model. The last part of this dissertation examined FMO 3 gene induction in a human hepatoma cell line, HepaRG. APAP induced FMO 3 gene expression in HepaRG cells, and over-expression of FMO 3 protects cells against APAP-induced cytotoxicity. The unexpected observation of a faster differentiation phenotype in HepaRG cells over-expressing FMO 3 suggests that FMO 3 may {{play an important role in}} cellular differentiation. Collectively, data presented in this thesis provide evidence for Fmo 3 as a novel genetic determinant of APAP-induced liver injury. Furthermore, this thesis describes a novel protective function for FMO 3. Findings from HepaRG cells suggest that FMO 3 over-expression in response to APAP may be a driving force for differentiation in regenerating hepatocytes...|$|E
40|$|Both {{the wild}} type and an {{isogenic}} hydrogenase-negative mutant of Azorhizobium caulinodans growing ex planta on N 2 as the N source were studied in succinate-limited steady-state chemostat cultures under 0. 2 to 3. 0 % dissolved O 2 tension. Production or consumption of O 2, H 2, and CO 2 {{was measured with}} an on-line-connected mass spectrometer. In the range of 0. 2 to 3. 0 %, growth of both the wild type and the mutant was equally dependent on the dissolved O 2 tension: the growth yield decreased, and the specific O 2 consumption and CO 2 production increased. A similar dependency on the dissolved O 2 tension was found for the mutant with 2. 5 % H 2 in the influent gas. The H 2 /N 2 ratio (moles of H 2 evolved per mole of N 2 consumed via nitrogenase) of the mutant, growing with or without 2. 5 % H 2, increased with increasing dissolved O 2 tensions. This increase in the H 2 /N 2 ratio was small but significant. The dependencies of the ATP/N 2 ratio (moles of ATP consumed per mole of N 2 fixed) and the ATP/ 2 e- ratio [moles of ATP consumed per mole of electron pairs transferred from NAD(P) H to nitrogenase] on the dissolved O 2 tension were estimated. These dependencies were interpreted {{in terms of the}} physiological concepts of respiratory protection and <b>autoprotection...</b>|$|E
40|$|Our {{earlier studies}} with S-(1, 2 -dichlorovinyl) -L-cysteine (DCVC) showed that prior {{administration}} {{of a low}} priming dose of 15 mg/kg, IP to mice, given 72 hours before administration of a normally lethal dose of DCVC (75 mg/kg, IP) led to renal tubule necrosis, however sustained renal tubule regeneration was observed and these mice recovered from renal failure and survived. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in this <b>autoprotection</b> model. Following the priming dose of DCVC, IL- 6 protein and mRNA increased markedly as early as 1 hour after dosing, peaking at 3 hours with a 1. 5 -fold increase in plasma. Immunocytochemistry on kidney sections using specific antibodies against TGF-α, HB-EGF, EGFr, IGF- 1 Rβ, Grb- 2, and phospho-p 44 / 42 MAP kinase (ERK 1 / 2) revealed a significantly higher staining of these molecules 3 to 72 hours after dosing, indicating up regulation of the ERK pathway. Following a lethal dose of DCVC (75 mg/kg) the early increase in these signaling molecules was not sustained, being markedly reduced 24 and 36 hours after dosing, leading to inhibition of S-phase DNA synthesis, cell division and renal tubule repair. In contrast, prior treatment with a low dose of DCVC, followed by a high dose led to a sustained stimulation of the renal ERK pathway, renal tubule regeneration and recovery from acute renal failure. These results suggest that a sustained activation of the ERK 1 / 2 pathway may be a key factor in enabling a continued renal tubule repair and hence protection from the progressive phase o...|$|E
