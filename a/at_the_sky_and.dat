[...] "We expect that there is, as we speak, another {{generation}} of kids {{out there who are}} looking up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> {{are going to be the}} next Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin", Obama said.

500|$|In {{the second}} half of the scenario, heavy rain descends on the city and the {{citizens}} try to flee, all again seen in slow motion. From the safety of shelter, the six [...] "strangers" [...] watch everyone's futile attempts to avoid the sudden change in weather. Eventually they decide to go outside, where they look up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> allow the rain to soak them. The video ends with Michael whipping his hair. During this scene, you hear a voicing softly in Russian, a reference to Moscow.|$|E
500|$|Without the engineers, {{the plans}} to develop Goodenough Island {{had to be}} postponed. Due to the {{strategic}} importance of the island for the forthcoming operations against the Imperial Japanese forces in the South West Pacific Area, the small Australian occupation force used deception and camouflage to make the Japanese believe that a brigade-sized force [...] occupied the island. They fabricated dummy structures, including a hospital, anti-aircraft guns constructed of simple logs pointed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> barricades of jungle vines which looked like barbed wire. They also lit fires to appear as cooking fires for large numbers of soldiers, and sent messages in easily broken codes consistent with a brigade.|$|E

500|$|While Lennon was [...] "evangelical in {{his enthusiasm}} for the Maharishi", {{according}} to his wife, Cynthia, she herself was [...] "a little more sceptical". [...] Cynthia later wrote that she [...] "loved being in India" [...] and had hoped she and Lennon would [...] "rediscover our lost closeness"; to her disappointment, however, Lennon became [...] "increasingly cold and aloof". The Lennons' room contained a [...] "four-poster bed, a dressing table, a couple of chairs and an electric fire". Lennon played guitar, while his wife drew pictures and wrote poetry between their long meditation sessions. After two weeks Lennon asked {{to sleep in a}} separate room, saying he could only meditate when he was alone. Meanwhile, he walked to the local post office every morning to check for Ono's almost daily telegrams. One of these telegrams read: [...] "Look up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> when you see a cloud think of me".|$|E
500|$|... "Come Running" [...] was {{described}} by Morrison as [...] "a very light type of song. It's not too heavy; it's just a happy-go-lucky song." [...] By contrast, Hinton found the song's sentiments tender and lustful in the vein of the 1967 Bob Dylan song [...] "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight". He argued that [...] "Come Running" [...] juxtaposed images of unstoppable nature—wind and rain, a passing train—against [...] "which human life and death play out their little games", which the narrator and his lover dream will not end [...] "while knowing of course it will". According to the writer, [...] "These Dreams of You" [...] manages to be simultaneously accusatory and reassuring. The lyrics cover such dream sequences as Ray Charles being shot down, paying dues in Canada, and [...] "his angel from above" [...] cheating while playing cards in the dark, slapping him in the face, ignoring his cries, and walking out on him. Morrison said he was inspired to write [...] "Brand New Day" [...] after hearing The Band on the radio playing either [...] "The Weight" [...] or [...] "I Shall Be Released": [...] "I looked up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> the sun started to shine {{and all of a}} sudden the song just came through my head. I started to write it down, right from 'When all the dark clouds roll away'." [...] Yorke quoted Morrison as saying in 1973 that [...] "Brand New Day" [...] was the song that worked best to his ear and the one with which he felt most in touch.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{penultimate}} episode, Drake asks Hunt if {{he killed}} Sam Tyler, with Hunt explaining that Tyler had been acting [...] "weird" [...] {{and asked for}} Hunt's help in faking his own death. However, the vision that Drake has of the police officer with injuries {{to the side of}} his face is connected to Tyler's presumed death, and a roll of undeveloped film apparently reveals where the policeman is supposedly buried. Along with this, Shaz, Ray and Chris all have visions of stars, as if looking up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> hear strange voices as described by Chris as Nelson (Tony Marshall), the publican from Life on Mars, asking him what he would like to drink.|$|E

2500|$|Coincidentally at {{this same}} time a new {{panchromatic}} photographic emulsion was developed that allowed {{the full range of}} colors to be captured. Soon after it became available Stieglitz aimed his 8" [...] x 10" [...] view camera <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> began taking pictures. By the next year he had created a series of ten mounted photographs he called Music: A Sequence of Ten Cloud Photographs (also called Clouds in Ten Movements). He told his wife Georgia O'Keeffe [...] "I wanted a series that when seen by Ernest Bloch (the great composer) he would exclaim: Music! Music! Man, why that is music! How did you ever do that? And he would point to violins and flutes, and oboes, and brass…" [...] He first exhibited this series in 1923 in his one-man show at the Anderson Galleries in New York, and reported that when Bloch saw them there he had exactly the reaction Stieglitz had wanted.|$|E
2500|$|Vladimir stands {{through most}} of the play whereas Estragon sits down {{numerous}} times and even dozes off. [...] "Estragon is inert and Vladimir restless." [...] Vladimir looks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> muses on religious or philosophical matters. Estragon [...] "belongs to the stone", preoccupied with mundane things, what he can get to eat and how to ease his physical aches and pains; he is direct, intuitive. He finds it hard to remember but can recall certain things when prompted, e.g., when Vladimir asks: [...] "Do you remember the Gospels?" [...] Estragon tells Vladimir about the coloured maps of the Holy Land and that he planned to honeymoon by the Dead Sea; it is his short-term memory that is poorest and points {{to the fact that he}} may, in fact, be suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Al Alvarez writes: [...] "But perhaps Estragon's forgetfulness is the cement binding their relationship together. He continually forgets, Vladimir continually reminds him; between them they pass the time." [...] They have been together for fifty years but when asked–by Pozzo–they do not reveal their actual ages.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} first shown the {{following}} week, at the 2002 E3 event, where a playable demo was made available. Whilst no narrative or story elements {{were in place}} yet, the demo featured environments from the Virescent Village level and the refinery level. Midway stressed the free-roaming nature of the game, saying [...] "you can fully roam throughout the large environments on the ground, then get into a spaceship, point it <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> climb to outer space. Up there, you'll {{be able to do}} battle with whatever's mean, then return to the ground and start walking around again." [...] GameSpot's Gerald Villoria wrote of this aspect of the demo [...] "the planet and all the explorable areas in Haven are seamlessly linked--traveling from one area of the world to the next should incur no game stoppage due to load times. In fact, when Haven gains access to his flying vessel, he can literally rise above the planet's atmosphere and explore any of the continents. The landmasses smoothly raise in level of detail as the descending aircraft approaches, with nearly featureless topography slowly morphing into fully landscaped wilderness until the ship can literally hover above the treetops." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1948 in an {{apartment}} in Harlem, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of William Blake (later referred to as his [...] "Blake vision"). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading Ah, Sunflower, The Sick Rose, and Little Girl Lost, also described by Ginsberg as [...] "voice of the ancient of days". The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice-work on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs. Ginsberg stated: [...] "living blue hand itself. [...] Or that God {{was in front of}} my eyes - existence itself was God" [...] and [...] "And it was a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe than I'd been existing in." ...|$|E
