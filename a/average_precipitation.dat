Fort Lauderdale has an average of 143 rain days and 250 sunshine days annually. The hurricane season is between June 1 and November 30 with major hurricanes most likely to affect the city or state in September and October. The most recent storms to directly affect the city were Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma, both of which struck the city in 2005. Other direct hits were Hurricane Cleo in 1964, Hurricane King in 1950, and the 1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The lake effect snowfalls {{are more}} likely to occur in late fall, early winter, and during spring due to the higher {{temperature}} differences between the lake and the air above it. During summer, the temperature differences can cause thunderstorms to form over the lake and drift eastward along the northern Wasatch Front. Some rainstorms may also be partially attributed to the lake effect in fall and spring. It is estimated that approximately six to eight lake effect snowstorms occur in a year, and that 10% of the <b>average</b> <b>precipitation</b> of Salt Lake City {{can be attributed to the}} lake effect.|$|E
5|$|Water vapor {{generated}} through {{surface evaporation}} is transported by circulatory {{patterns in the}} atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the <b>average</b> <b>precipitation</b> that falls in each region.|$|E

Although Aristotle's map was oversimplified, the general idea was correct. Today, {{the most commonly used}} climate map is the Köppen climate classification, developed by Russian climatologist of German descent and amateur botanist Wladimir Köppen (1846-1940), which divides the world into five major climate regions, based on <b>average</b> annual <b>precipitation,</b> <b>average</b> monthly <b>precipitation,</b> and <b>average</b> monthly temperature.|$|R
25|$|In {{common with}} the rest of the coastal areas of the UK, Fleetwood has a {{maritime}} climate. Prevailing winds and weather patterns are northwesterly, leading to a slightly higher <b>average</b> <b>precipitation</b> than the country as a whole, although the absence of high ground in the immediate vicinity moderates this. As with most coastal areas, frost and snow are uncommon. Temperatures are close to the national average.|$|E
25|$|North Dakota is {{far from}} major sources of {{moisture}} {{and is in the}} transition zone between the moist East and the semi-arid West, as precipitation and humidity decrease from east to west.

25|$|Water runoff often {{collects}} over watersheds {{flowing into}} rivers. A mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a hydrological transport model. Some water is diverted to irrigation for agriculture. Rivers and seas offer opportunity for travel and commerce. Through erosion, runoff shapes the environment creating river valleys and deltas which provide rich soil and level {{ground for the}} establishment of population centers. A flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. It is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea. A drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply. This occurs when a region receives consistently below <b>average</b> <b>precipitation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bosaso has a hot {{desert climate}} (Köppen climate {{classification}} BWh). It has a mean annual relative humidity of around 60%. The average daily mean temperature year-round is 30°C, {{with an average}} annual high of 35°C and an average annual low of 25°C. Average low temperatures are coolest {{during the winter months}} of December to February, when thermometer readings typically level out at 20°C. The weather slowly heats up in the spring, as the April rainy season begins. Average high temperatures later peak during the summer months of June to August, when they consistently exceed 40°C (104°F). Come September, cooler weather starts to set in again. Rainfall reaches a high over this period, with an <b>average</b> <b>precipitation</b> of 7mm (0.28 inches) in November. Total rainfall year-round is around 19mm (0.76 inches).|$|E
25|$|In western Jämtland mild winters with {{excessive}} precipitation are common. This {{is because}} of the warm winds brought to the area by the Gulf Stream. The <b>average</b> <b>precipitation</b> in the Jamtish Fells is roughly 1 000 millimetres per year, with Skäckerfjällen as extreme with about 1 500mm. The precipitation rates {{in the middle of the}} province are much more moderate. In fact the central and eastern parts of Jämtland have precipitation shortages, in Storsjöbygden the annual averages is as low as 500mm. Due to the warm winds the temperature during the winters reaches its maximum in the fell region with about -7-8°C in Storlien and the environs. The coldest winter temperatures are found in the province's outskirts like Börtnan with roughly -11°C. Maximum temperatures in the summer months average from the 14°C in Jämtland's eastern parts to around 11°C in the fell region. Though on certain mountain peaks the averages are usually as low as 5°C.|$|E
