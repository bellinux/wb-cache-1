5|$|The {{independent}} Democratic Republic of Georgia was {{invaded by}} the Red Army in 1921 and a Soviet government was installed. The government of Soviet Georgia created an autonomous administrative unit for Transcaucasian Ossetians in April 1922, called the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast. Historians such <b>as</b> <b>Stephen</b> F. Jones, Emil Souleimanov and Arsène Saparov {{believe that the}} Bolsheviks granted this autonomy to the Ossetians {{in exchange for their}} help in fighting the Democratic Republic of Georgia, since this area had never been a separate entity prior to the Russian invasion.|$|E

5|$|Before he {{controlled}} Deddington, Chesney temporarily {{administered the}} lands of Robert d'Oilly, who had previously held Oxford Castle but had defected {{to the side of}} the Empress Matilda in 1141 and died a year later. D'Oilly's heir took refuge with Matilda when Stephen overran his lands two weeks after his father's death, leading to Chesney's control of the d'Oilly lands. Some historians have seen this holding of the lands <b>as</b> <b>Stephen</b> giving Chesney the d'Oilly barony, but the only evidence for this is that Chesney eventually owned a manor previously belonging to d'Oilly which does not necessarily mean that he received the whole barony. It is far more likely that Stephen gave Chesney parts of {{the lands of}} William fitzOsbern, which had reverted to the king in 1075. Most of the known lands of fitzOsbern are known to have been owned by Chesney or by tenants who held the lands from him.|$|E
5|$|Casimir IV's successor, John I Albert, {{wanted to}} grant Moldavia to his younger brother, Sigismund, but Stephen's {{diplomacy}} {{prevented him from}} invading Moldavia for years. John Albert broke into Moldavia in 1497, but Stephen and his Hungarian and Ottoman allies routed the Polish army in the Battle of the Cosmin Forest. Stephen again tried to recapture Chilia and Cetatea Albă, but had to acknowledge {{the loss of the}} two ports to the Ottomans in 1503. During his last years, his son and co-ruler, Bogdan III, played {{an active role in the}} government. Stephen's long rule represented a period of stability in the history of Moldavia. From the 16th century onwards both his subjects and foreigners remembered him as a great ruler. Modern Romanians regard him as one of their greatest national heroes, although he also endures as a cult figure in Moldovenism. After the Romanian Orthodox Church canonized him in 1992, he is venerated <b>as</b> <b>Stephen</b> the Great and Holy (Ștefan cel Mare și Sfânt).|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid was an {{advocate}} {{for the use of}} music in ecclesiastical ceremonies. He sent to Kent for a singing master to instruct his clergy in the Roman style of church music, which involved a double choir who sang in antiphons and responses. Bede says that this singing master was named Æddi (or Eddius in Latin) and had the surname Stephen. Traditionally historians have identified Æddi <b>as</b> <b>Stephen</b> of Ripon, author of the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, which has led to the assumption that the Vita was based on the recollections of one of Wilfrid's long-time companions. However, recent scholarship has come to believe that the Vita was not authored by the singing master, but by someone who joined Wilfrid {{in the last years of}} Wilfrid's life, not a close companion.|$|E

5|$|A five team group stage then followed, {{in which}} each team played the others once. Manchester City were drawn with Twente, Schalke 04, Racing de Santander and Paris Saint-Germain. City topped the group, after wins against Twente and Schalke, a draw with Paris Saint-Germain and a defeat in a dead rubber in Santander. The {{knockout}} stages then resumed, with a visit to F.C. Copenhagen in freezing conditions. City took the lead twice but could only draw 2–2. The home leg was more comfortable, and ended in a 2–1 victory. Another Danish club, Aalborg, awaited in the next round. Both matches finished 2–0 to the home side, and the tie was decided by a penalty shootout, which Manchester City won. City then faced Hamburger SV, in their first European quarter-final since 1979. The away leg was played first, and started exceptionally well for Manchester City, <b>as</b> <b>Stephen</b> Ireland scored after just 35 seconds. However, Hamburg soon equalised, and won the match 3–1. A difficult task in the home leg soon became even harder, when Hamburg scored an away goal early in the match. City scored twice, the first by Elano, who also hit the woodwork on two occasions with free-kicks. However, City could not produce the third goal that would have taken the tie into extra time.|$|E
