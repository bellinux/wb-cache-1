5|$|Despite the {{nomenclature}} of Diet (Assembly or Parliament), {{this institution}} should {{in no way}} be construed as a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the male population. Furthermore, this impractical solution did not reflect the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play {{a pivotal role in}} German politics.|$|E

Only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> their structure (around 2–4 amino acids) is directly involved in catalysis: the catalytic site. This catalytic site is located next {{to one or more}} binding sites where residues orient the substrates. The catalytic site and binding site together comprise the enzyme's active site.

Loring was primarily home to active duty units, although this changed in the 1980s, when the Massachusetts Air National Guard's 101st Fighter Squadron sent a detachment to Loring. As the base was the closest in the U.S. to Europe, it also functioned as an important stopover point.|$|E
