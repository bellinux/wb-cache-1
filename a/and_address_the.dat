Business Korea {{reported that}} the issues were connected to the triple-layer cell NAND storage of the affected models. Triple-layer cells can store three bits of data per cell of flash, and are cheaper than dual-layer cell solutions, but {{at the cost of}} performance. It was reported that Apple had planned to switch the affected model lines back to multi-layer cell flash, <b>and</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> performance issues on existing devices in a future iOS update.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} mayoral election, there was support for Lane as a {{potential}} Democratic candidate for Vice President, though since {{he was born in}} what was by then a Canadian province he was ineligible under the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an era when political convention delegates were far more free to make their own choices than they are today, Lane wrote that he had heard that he could gain the support of the New York delegation, which he declined to do. While returning to California from a trip to Washington, D.C., as an advocate for the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project, he stopped in Austin, Texas, to confer with Democratic leaders <b>and</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> legislature. The New York Times saw this as part of a campaign to secure the vice-presidential nomination, and stated that he had been promised help from Texas.|$|E

5|$|In July 2010, Beshear {{announced}} six mandatory, unpaid furlough {{days for}} most state employees {{in order to}} achieve the savings called for by the budget. Later in the month, Beshear announced exceptions from the furlough for public safety and mental health care workers. The American Federation of County State and Municipal Employees (AFCSME) Council 62, which represents about 9,000 of Kentucky's state workers, filed suit to block implementation of the furloughs. A Franklin County Circuit Court Judge refused to issue an injunction in September 2010, but allowed the lawsuit to proceed. A month later, AFCSME agreed to drop the suit <b>and</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> furlough issue through Beshear's Employee Advisory Council. Ultimately, all six furlough days were observed as outlined in Beshear's plan.|$|E
5|$|This {{approach}} {{demonstrates the}} effects of gender inequalities by enhancing macroeconomic models. Bernard Walters shows that traditional neoclassical models fail to adequately assess work related to reproduction by assuming that the population and labor are determined exogenously. That fails {{to account for the}} fact that inputs are produced through caring labor, which is disproportionately performed by women. Stephen Knowels et al. use a neoclassical growth model to show that women's education has a positive statistically significant effect on labor productivity, more robust than that of men's education. In both of these cases, economists highlight <b>and</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> gender biases of macroeconomic variables to show that gender plays a significant role in models' outcomes.|$|E

25|$|Thus far, {{there are}} no {{available}} oxygen-carrying blood substitutes, which is the typical objective of a blood (RBC) transfusion; however, there are widely available non-blood volume expanders for cases where only volume restoration is required.

25|$|Religious beliefs often seek to {{identify}} <b>and</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> basic problems of human life, including the conflicts between, among, and within persons and societies.

25|$|European {{culture and}} Christianity {{have had a}} {{significant}} impact on Indigenous Australians. As in many colonial situations the churches both facilitated the loss of Indigenous Australian culture and religion and also facilitated its maintenance. The involvement of Christians in Aboriginal affairs has evolved significantly since 1788. Around the year 2000, many churches and church organisations officially apologised for past failures to adequately respect indigenous cultures <b>and</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> injustices of the dispossession of indigenous people.|$|E
25|$|The CIA Chief of Station {{persuaded the}} Commander in Chief of the Royal Lao Army, Lieutenant General Bounphone Marthepharak, {{to fly in}} <b>and</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> 2,000 mutineers.

However, his patriotic harangue aroused them to cheers, and the first few 50-man helicopter loads of troops loaded for deployment and left. The general left on his helicopter to meet the airlifted troops at Bouamlong. The weather turned bad, grounding further helilifts. Half of GM 31 deserted; more than that abandoned GM 33. With half the troops gone, the off and on mutineers were disarmed and flown to the training base at Seno.|$|E
25|$|Jim Voytilla of the Ramsey County, Minnesota, Human Services Department created EA {{groups for}} intellectually {{disabled}} substance abusers in 1979.

Voytilla's EA meetings were created to avoid these problems, <b>and</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> illnesses of his clients other than substance abuse. Since then, four articles have narrowly defined EA as a program specifically for mentally retarded or intellectually disabled substance abusers. In a similar way, EA has also been incorrectly described as an organization either specifically or primarily {{for those who have}} been discharged from psychiatric hospitals.|$|E

There is a reference to an Indian actor named Strongheart in a newspaper from Indiana in May 1916 in connection with a silent movie variously named Indiana, Historic Indiana, or The Birth of Indiana that was released {{in the middle of that}} year. In 1916 he joined the Society of American Indians, a progressive group composed mostly of Native Americans, established to improve their health, education, civil rights, and local government, <b>and</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> problems they faced.|$|E
25|$|The match {{saw the two}} grapplers exchanging leglocks {{without any}} decisive movement. Following a barrage of light blows by Silveira Sakuraba dropped for a low single leg takedown, but referee John McCarthy stopped the fight before Sakuraba could {{complete}} it, believing he had been knocked out by the punches. A loud protest followed from the crowd and an angry Sakuraba attempted unsuccessfully to take the microphone <b>and</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> Japanese audience. However, after reviewing tape, McCarthy changed his decision to a no-contest. As Tank Abbott, who had earlier defeated Anjoh, had dropped from the tournament due to an injured hand, it was ruled that Sakuraba and Silveira faced off once more that night in {{what would be the}} championship bout of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|After the war {{and under}} the {{influence}} of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, General Douglas MacArthur, Japanese political and religious life was reformed to produce a demilitarised and democratic country. Although a new constitution was established in 1947, it was not until the beginning of the Korean War that Japan (as an ally of the United States) saw a growth in its economy brought about by the manufacture of industrial goods. In 1946 the Prefabricated Housing Association was formed to try <b>and</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> chronic shortage of housing, and architects like Kunio Maekawa submitted designs. However, it was not until the passing of the Public Housing Act in 1951 that housing built by the private sector was supported in law by the government. Also in 1946, the War Damage Rehabilitation Board put forward ideas for the reconstruction of thirteen Japanese cities. Architect Kenzō Tange submitted proposals for Hiroshima and Maebashi.|$|E
