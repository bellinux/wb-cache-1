500|$|Alarmed, Kennedy {{considered}} various reactions, {{and ultimately}} {{responded to the}} installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba with a naval blockade and presented an ultimatum to the Soviets. Khrushchev backed down from a confrontation, and the Soviet Union removed the missiles in return for an American pledge not to invade Cuba again. Castro later admitted that [...] "I would have agreed {{to the use of}} nuclear weapons. ... we took it for granted that it would become a nuclear war anyway, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to disappear." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{process of}} putting {{together}} All the Way... A Decade of Song was laborious for all involved, from balancing {{the number of}} hits and new songs to ensuring {{that each of the}} latest tracks showed a new side of Dion. [...] "We had hourly conversations, back and forth, about what the combination should be," [...] said John Doelp, the album's co-executive producer. [...] "We wanted to make sure we had some new sounds <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to go to new places." [...] Co-executive producer Vito Luprano added: [...] "The first idea was to record three new songs, then Dion said, 'Let's go for five,' her lucky number. But we had so many great songs coming in that we ended up recording nine. Out of that, we decided to go with seven." ...|$|E
500|$|December 1967 {{also saw}} the release of Their Satanic Majesties Request (UK No. 3; US No. 2), which {{received}} unfavourable reviews and was widely regarded as a poor imitation of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Satanic Majesties had been recorded in difficult circumstances while Jagger, Richards and Jones were dealing with their court cases. The band parted ways with Oldham during the sessions. The split was amicable, at least publicly, but in 2003 Jagger said: [...] "The reason Andrew left was because he thought that we weren't concentrating <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> being childish. It was not a great moment really – and I {{would have thought it}} wasn't a great moment for Andrew either. There were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus you at that point, that was Andrew's job." ...|$|E

500|$|American {{officials}} were uncomfortable with Diefenbaker's initial election, believing {{they had heard}} undertones of anti-Americanism in the campaign. After years of the Liberals, one US State Department official noted, [...] "We'll be dealing with an unknown quantity." [...] Diefenbaker's 1958 landslide was viewed with disappointment by the US officials, who knew and liked Pearson from his years in diplomacy and who felt the Liberal Party leader {{would be more likely}} to institute pro-American policies. However, US President Dwight Eisenhower took pains to foster good relations with Diefenbaker. The two men found much in common, from Western farm backgrounds to a love of fishing, and Diefenbaker had an admiration for war leaders such as Eisenhower and Churchill. Diefenbaker wrote in his memoirs, [...] "I might add that President Eisenhower and I were from our first meeting on an 'Ike–John' basis, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> as close as the nearest telephone." [...] The Eisenhower–Diefenbaker relationship was sufficiently strong that the touchy Canadian Prime Minister was prepared to overlook slights. When Eisenhower addressed Parliament in October 1958, he downplayed trade concerns that Diefenbaker had publicly expressed. Diefenbaker said nothing and took Eisenhower fishing.|$|E
500|$|The {{sound was}} {{provided}} by Solotech. Front of house engineer Blake Suib explained that, [...] " [...] and Solotech were asked {{to come up with}} a design that blocked the least amount of seats but provided the quality and coverage that [...] expects <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> looking for". The public address (PA) was made of 64 Milos that split into four hangs of 16 per hang. Two at the 50 yard line pointed one way and directly behind, two at the 50 yard line pointed the opposite way. Also present were 32 Micas; 16 per hang, pointing to the sides. Each one of the four hangs had its own equalization (EQ) and level control, so in case one of the speakers were louder there would be a separate EQ to compensate for any change in the tone due to the distance. All the components and tools used in the public address were designed by Meyer Sound Laboratories, including a software called Mapp, used to decide where to point the PA; the Simm, to analyze and time align the PA accurately; and the Galileo, used to EQ and balance all the sections of the PA. The speakers were self-powered with amplifiers also built by Meyer Sounds. There were 24 HP700 subwoofers positioned all over the arena floor, and the Simm and Galileo were used to time align. Spears used a Crown CM-311AE headset microphone wearing the mic's beltpack (usually hidden in color matching material) on her top or pants, she did not use in-ear monitors; instead 12 Meyer CQs were positioned, eight flown around the center ring and two on each of the smaller stages. Spears specifically asked Suib to make the show sound similar to a dance club. Solotech provided the lighting package, including a mostly Vari-Lite rig, with 80 each VL3000s and VL3500s in various positions, and 60 VL500s built into the stage deck. Whitehouse also had 18 PRG Bad Boy luminaires, 16 of which sat in pods that hung in various positions lower than the rest of the rig, with two more at either end of the stage. Each of the eight pods housed two Bad Boys, two of the VL3500s, one Robert Juliat Ivanhoe followspot with scroller under DMX control, and a Molefay. Fifty Martin Professional Atomic Color strobes and four front of house Robert Juliat Aramis followspots rounded out the lighting package. The lightning team had to rehearse for a month to prepare. The tour was also the first to use the touring version of the PRG Virtuoso V676 console to control the system, which was used from the beginning of the European leg until the end of the tour. Pyrotechnics and jets of smoke used in the show were created by Lorenzo Cornacchia of Pyrotek Special Effects and Tait Towers.|$|E

2500|$|On 4 September 1884, Gordon's {{fortunes}} took a {{turn for}} the worse when the most able of his subordinates Mohammed Aly together with about 1, 000 of Gordon's best troops were killed in an ambush, while conducting a raid. Gordon wrote in his diary that Mohammed Aly had captured [...] "a lad of 12 or 14 years of age, and the little chap spoke out boldly, and said he believed Mohamed Ahmed was the Mahdi <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> dogs.

John Hale explained how this supposedly worked: [...] "the Witch by the cast of her eye sends forth a Malefick Venome into the Bewitched to cast him into a fit, and therefore the touch of the hand doth by sympathy cause that venome to return into the Body of the Witch again".|$|E

2500|$|After Hamas leader Khaled Mashal paid an {{official}} visit to Turkey, relations began to cool off. In January 2010, Israel protested when an episode ("Ambush") of the Turkish soap opera Valley of the Wolves depicted Israeli intelligence spying inside Turkey and kidnapping Turkish babies. The series depicted a fictional Mossad {{attack on the}} Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv in which the ambassador {{and his family are}} taken hostage. On 11 January 2010, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon met with Turkish ambassador Ahmet Oğuz Çelikkol, who was seated on a stool that was lower than Ayalon's. Ayalon allegedly turned to his aide and quipped, [...] "The main thing is that you see that he <b>is</b> seated low <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> high ... <b>that</b> there is one flag on the table (the Israeli flag) <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not smiling." ...|$|R

2500|$|On 16 October, Catalogue was {{published}} by Thames & Hudson, a 336-page hardcover book, written by Philip Hoare and Chris Heath, detailing their entire visual output (photography, {{as well as the}} design of albums, videos, tours, books and fan club magazines) from 1984 to 2004. Neil Tennant comments in the book: [...] "In the beginning we made a decision – and it was in our EMI contract – that that we would have control over how everything worked; that obviously the songs mattered hugely, but the way they were presented was going to matter hugely as well; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> never going to give up on that." [...] Pet Shop Boys supported the publication of the book with signings in London, New York City, Los Angeles and Berlin. To coincide with the publication of Catalogue, a small exhibition of portraits of Pet Shop Boys opened in the Bookshop Gallery of London's National Portrait Gallery, on 30 October 2006 and ran to 28 February 2007.|$|E
