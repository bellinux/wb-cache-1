The 1972 passage of Title IX led {{to the establishment of}} intercollegiate women's volleyball and women's basketball teams in 1975, with home games <b>at</b> <b>Wills</b> Gym. In addition to equal playing opportunities for female athletes, however, Title IX also required equal facilities {{for both men and women}} and the facilities <b>at</b> <b>Wills</b> were not only older and in deteriorating condition, but were considerably smaller than those at the Memorial Gym as the seating capacity <b>at</b> <b>Wills</b> Gym had been reduced to near 100 by the mid 1970s. Both women's teams initially played all or most of their schedule <b>at</b> <b>Wills</b> for their first few seasons before permanently moving to Memorial Gym for the 1977-78 seasons.

5|$|Allied {{aircraft}} specifically started targeting ZNDH and Luftwaffe {{bases and}} aircraft {{for the first}} time as a result of the Seventh anti-Partisan Offensive, including Operation Rösselsprung in late May 1944. Until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost <b>at</b> <b>will</b> as long as they remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during Rösselsprung as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse {{for the first time}}, establishing full aerial superiority. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.|$|E

Three Victoria Crosses and a host of lesser awards were given to the men involved. The Admiralty presented it as a fine example of daring and careful planning from the Royal Navy, providing a valuable morale boost at {{one of the most critical}} moments of the war.|$|E

The Mirror portrayed Warwick as a great man: beloved by the people, and betrayed by the man he helped raise to the throne.
