40|$|Making <b>associations</b> <b>between</b> sensory stimuli is a {{critical}} aspect of behavior. Our laboratory previously showed that neurons in the lateral intraparietal (LIP) area of Macaca mulatta reflect learned <b>associations</b> <b>between</b> directions of moving visual stimuli. Individual LIP neurons might encode associations only for specific stimuli, such as motion directions; alternatively, they may encode more general associations whenever animals must decide between discrete alternatives. To test this, we asked whether LIP neurons encode learned <b>associations</b> <b>between</b> pairs of arbitrarily chosen static shapes and, in a separate task, whether the same neurons also encode <b>associations</b> <b>between</b> motion directions. The experimental design dissociated the visual associations from the movements used to report those associations. We found robust encoding of the learned pair <b>associations</b> <b>between</b> shapes, and shape-pair selective neurons tended to also be selective for direction associations. These findings suggest that representing generic categorical outcomes may be a fundamental role of parietal neurons. The primate brain is adept at rapidly making and breaking <b>associations</b> <b>between</b> sensory stimuli. Associative learning has long been considered a function of frontal and tempora...|$|R

5|$|In Europe, {{a cohort}} study of 467,450 Danish {{children}} found no <b>association</b> <b>between</b> TCVs and autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), nor any dose-response relationship between thiomersal and ASDs {{that would be}} suggestive of toxic exposure. An ecological analysis that studied 956 Danish children diagnosed with autism likewise did not show an <b>association</b> <b>between</b> autism and thiomersal. A retrospective cohort study on 109,863 children in the United Kingdom found no <b>association</b> <b>between</b> TCVs and autism, but a possible increased risk for tics. Analysis in this study also showed a possible protective effect with respect to general developmental disorders, attention-deficit disorder, and otherwise unspecified developmental delay. Another UK study based on a prospective cohort of 13,617 children likewise found more associated benefits than risks from thiomersal exposure with respect to developmental disorders. Because the Danish and UK studies involved only diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) or diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccines, they are less relevant for the higher thiomersal exposure levels {{that occurred in the}} U.S.|$|E

Path analyses indicated significant positive within spouse, but not cross-partner, <b>associations</b> <b>between</b> attachment security and support perceptions. Although attachment security and marital satisfaction were associated, spouses’ attachment security only marginally predicted marital satisfaction in the mediation model.

25|$|Vertebrobasilar artery stroke (VAS) is {{statistically}} associated with chiropractic services in persons under 45 years of age, {{but it is}} similarly associated with general practitioner services, suggesting that these associations are likely explained by preexisting conditions. Weak to moderately strong evidence supports causation (as opposed to statistical <b>association)</b> <b>between</b> cervical manipulative therapy (CMT) and VAS. There is insufficient evidence to support a strong association or no <b>association</b> <b>between</b> cervical manipulation and stroke. While the biomechanical evidence {{is not sufficient to}} support the statement that CMT causes cervical artery dissection (CD), clinical reports suggest that mechanical forces have a part in a substantial number of CDs and the majority of population controlled studies found an <b>association</b> <b>between</b> CMT and VAS in young people. It is strongly recommended that practitioners consider the plausibility of CD as a symptom, and people can be informed of the <b>association</b> <b>between</b> CD and CMT before administrating manipulation of the cervical spine. There is controversy regarding the degree of risk of stroke from cervical manipulation. Many chiropractors state that, the <b>association</b> <b>between</b> chiropractic therapy and vertebral arterial dissection is not proven. However, {{it has been suggested that}} the causality between chiropractic cervical manipulation beyond the normal range of motion and vascular accidents is probable or definite. There is very low evidence supporting a small <b>association</b> <b>between</b> internal carotid artery dissection and chiropractic neck manipulation. The incidence of internal carotid artery dissection following cervical spine manipulation is unknown. The literature infrequently reports helpful data to better understand the <b>association</b> <b>between</b> cervical manipulative therapy, cervical artery dissection and stroke. The limited evidence is inconclusive that chiropractic spinal manipulation therapy is not a cause of intracranial hypotension. Cervical intradural disc herniation is very rare following spinal manipulation therapy.|$|E
