Violence marked {{the early months of}} Reconstruction. Juneteenth commemorates the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Galveston by General Gordon Granger, almost {{two and a half years}} after the original announcement. President Johnson, in 1866, declared the civilian government restored in Texas. Despite not meeting reconstruction requirements, Congress resumed allowing elected Texas representatives into the federal government in 1870. Social volatility continued as the state struggled with <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> and labor issues.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars and the {{subsequent}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression,</b> coupled {{with the collapse of the}} Tonbridge Bank in 1812, Woodgate was declared bankrupt in 1816. In that year, Woodgate offered Somerhill for sale to the Duke of Wellington, who declined to buy it as the foxhunting was not good enough for his liking. Somerhill was bought from the descendants of William Woodgate in November 1819 by James Alexander, MP. By 1830, Somerhill had been substantially repaired, and new landscaping was undertaken. In 1832, Anthony Salvin was engaged to make improvements to the house, but retaining its original style. During the severe winter of 1835-36, skating was possible on the lake at Somerhill for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Two drains were built, {{of which}} the most {{successful}} was the Swinefleet Warping Drain, pioneered by Ralph Creyke and T.H.S. Sotheron, and authorised by an Act of Parliament. Opened in 1821, poor-quality land was reclaimed for around forty years. The other scheme was Durham's Warping Drain, {{to the north of}} Thorne, which ran westwards to a sluice on the River Don. The drain was completed in 1856 by Makin Durham, but he failed to achieve much reclamation of the peat moors. He died in 1882, just as ideas to use the peat commercially began to replace the concept of attempting to make the moors suitable for agriculture. The change was brought about by an <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> and the high price of straw for animal bedding.|$|E
50|$|With {{large numbers}} of indoor and outdoor staff, country houses were {{important}} as places of employment for many rural communities. In turn, until the <b>agricultural</b> <b>depressions</b> of the 1870s, the estates, of which country houses were the hub, provided their owners with incomes. However, the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the swansong of the traditional English country house lifestyle. Increased taxation {{and the effects of}} World War I led to the demolition of hundreds of houses; those that remained had to adapt to survive.|$|R
50|$|The mill furthest {{upstream}} was Scole Flax Mill, {{although it}} was not a watermill, being powered by steam. It was built by C.F. Costerton in 1854, in an attempt to alleviate poverty during the <b>agricultural</b> <b>depressions</b> of the 1840s, which followed the cessation of war with France. He persuaded farmers to grow flax, and provided the facilities to process it, both at the mill and at a factory in Eye run by his business partner Peter Naylor. The flax was grown for its fibres, which were used to make linen sheeting, sacking and rope, and for its seeds, from which linseed oil was obtained. Production was encouraged by presenting a cup each year to the farmer who had produced the highest yield on 3 acre of land. With the mill affected by a decline in local supplies and overseas competition, it closed in 1881, after which the machinery was removed and the buildings demolished.|$|R

5|$|Important for the {{adoption}} of the style {{in the early nineteenth century}} was Abbotsford House, the residence of the novelist and poet, Sir Walter Scott. Re-built for him from 1816, it became a model for the modern revival of the baronial style. Common features borrowed from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century houses included battlemented gateways, crow-stepped gables, pointed turrets and machicolations. The style was popular across Scotland and was applied to relatively modest dwellings by architects such as William Burn (1789–1870), David Bryce (1803–76), Edward Blore (1787–1879), Edward Calvert (c. 1847–1914) and Robert Stodart Lorimer (1864–1929). The publication of Robert Billings' Baronial and Ecclesiastical Architecture of Scotland (1848–52) provided a handbook for the style and the rebuilding of Balmoral Castle as a baronial palace (and subsequent adoption as a royal retreat from 1855–58) confirmed its popularity. Estate house building boomed between about 1855 and the <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> and Glasgow Bank crash of 1878. Construction was now dominated by patronage from nouveau riche industrialists. The decline in numbers of servants, linked to the introduction of electricity, central heating and labour-saving devices such as the vacuum cleaner, also led to changes in the scale of building. Arts and crafts designs first featured in Philip Webb's (1831–1915) gothic design at Arisaig (1863–64). It was pursed by William Lethaby at Melsetter House, Hoy (1898) for a Birmingham industrialist.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the {{population}} of Frinsted declined from 208 (1881) to 150 (1921), a trend typical of downland parishes as a consequence of <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> and the mechanisation of farming practises.|$|E
25|$|By 1880, the <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> had {{led some}} holders into {{financial}} shortfalls {{as they tried}} to balance maintenance of their estate with the income it provided. Some relied on funds from secondary sources such as banking and trade while others, like the severely impoverished Duke of Marlborough, sought American heiresses.|$|E
50|$|It {{empowered}} {{courts in}} certain cases to compensate a tenant upon eviction even if the eviction was for non-payment of rent, provided that the tenant could prove that inability to pay was {{a direct result of}} <b>agricultural</b> and economic <b>depression.</b>|$|R
50|$|Poverty {{continued}} to be a problem for many of the villagers, particularly during the <b>agricultural</b> <b>depressions</b> at the beginning and latter part of the century. In 1816 Thomas Clabburn left £400 invested in annuities for the relief of the parish poor, the interest to purchase bread or coal to be distributed on the first Monday of February each year. A handsome plate recording this charity can be seen on the vestry door of the church. Further relief for the needy came from the interest from £45 Consuls left by Miss Bateman in 1828. Alongside these the Meek Charity dating from 1598, was distributed. By 1840 the parish poor house, the Town House, was ninety years old and in a sad state of repair. The newly appointed rector, Henry Preston, did not hesitate to call it the 'Pest House' and donated materials for immediate repairs. At the same time he forbade the practice of forcing the old and infirm residents to work on the nearby allotments. In 1836 Pulham Workhouse, still clearly visible as Hillcrest Court on the A140, began to take over responsibility for the destitute of the area and the Town House was eventually converted into two cottages for the parish roadmen, being conveniently close to the parish gravel and marl pits in Marl Bottom.|$|R
5|$|John's son George John, 2nd Earl Spencer {{inherited}} Althorp {{after his}} father's death in 1783. He served as Whig MP for Northampton from 1780 to 1782 and for Surrey from 1782 to 1783 before accepting {{the title of}} 2nd Earl Spencer. He was later Home Secretary from 1806 to 1807 under Lord Grenville in the Ministry of All the Talents. Extremely interested in literary pursuits, he developed {{one of the largest}} private libraries in Europe at Althorp. He was the instigator and first President of the Roxburghe Club (an exclusive bibliophilic club), founded in 1812, President of the Royal Institution from 1813 to 1827, and Commissioner of the Public Records in 1831, among other literary pursuits. In later life, his collecting habit had become an obsession, and he attempted to collect every volume ever published in Britain. Such was his desire to obtain as complete a collection as possible, that when Napoleon instigated the secularisation of religious houses in south Germany, Spencer used the local British agent and Benedictine monk, Alexander Horn to acquire many of their rare books and manuscripts. Althorp became a major cultural hub of England during his time; at one Christmas, the actor David Garrick, the historian Edward Gibbon, the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan and the painter Joshua Reynolds, among other artistic figures. attended a party there together. However, George John's spending became problematic for the Spencers, especially as at the time they were feeling the impact of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>depressions</b> brought on by the Napoleonic Wars. By {{the time of his death}} in 1834 he had amassed a debt of £500,000, which he passed onto his son, John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer.|$|R
25|$|During the Panics of 1893 and 1907, {{many banks}} filed {{bankruptcy}} {{due to bank}} runs caused by contagion. Both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance. In 1893, William Jennings Bryan presented a bill to Congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund. No action was taken, as the legislature {{paid more attention to}} the <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> at the time.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> of the 1930s, the government encouraged domestic production by imposing tariffs on agricultural imports. This policy enjoyed some success: the total area under cultivation increased, and farm incomes fell less sharply in Finland than in most other countries. Barriers to grain imports stimulated a return to mixed farming, and by 1938 Finland's farmers were able to meet roughly 90 percent of the domestic demand for grain.|$|E
25|$|During the Civil War, 30,000 Mississippi soldiers, mostly white, {{died from}} wounds and disease, {{and many more}} were left {{crippled}} and wounded. Changes to the labor structure and an <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> throughout the South caused severe losses in wealth. In 1860 assessed valuation of property in Mississippi {{had been more than}} $500 million, of which $218 million (43 percent) was estimated as the value of slaves. By 1870, total assets had decreased in value to roughly $177 million.|$|E

25|$|Mining {{and other}} {{industries}} gradually {{developed in the}} area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging. However, the military demobilization, an <b>agricultural</b> economic <b>depression</b> which hit places like El Paso first before the larger Great Depression was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as {{in the rest of}} the United States, the Depression era overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the white community. Nonetheless, whites remained the majority to the 1940s.|$|R
50|$|The {{stock market}} crash of 1929 only hastened an already steep decline in Winnipeg; the Great Depression {{resulted}} in massive unemployment, which was worsened by drought and depressed <b>agricultural</b> prices. The <b>Depression</b> ended when World War II started in 1939. The first Canadian to see battle was Winnipegger Selby Roger Henderson who enlisted in the RAF just {{before the start of}} the war. He participated in the attack on enemy ships at Wilhelmshaven, Germany on September 4, 1939.|$|R
25|$|Around {{the start}} of the 20th century, two-thirds of the Mississippi farmers who owned land in the Delta were African American. Many had become overextended with debt during the falling cotton prices of the {{difficult}} years of the late 19th century. Cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the Civil War. As another <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> lowered cotton prices into the 1890s, however, numerous African-American farmers finally had to sell their land to pay off debts, thus losing the land which they had developed by personal labor.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s farm {{production}} had increased dramatically thanks to mechanization, more potent insecticides and {{increased use of}} fertilizer. Due to an overproduction of agricultural products farmers faced a severe and chronic <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> throughout the 1920s. The Great Depression even worsened the agricultural crises. At the beginning of 1933 agricultural markets nearly faced collapse. Farm prices were so low that, as an example, in Montana wheat was rotting in the fields because {{it could not be}} profitably harvested. In Oregon sheep were slaughtered and left to the buzzards because meat prices were not sufficient to warrant transportation to markets.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1870s, these estates often {{encompassed}} {{several thousand}} acres, generally {{consisting of a}} home farm, kitchen gardens (utilised to supply the mansion with meat, milk, fruit and vegetables), and several farms let to tenants. While such estates were sufficiently profitable to maintain the mansion and provide a partial—if not complete—income, the <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> of the 1870s changed the viability of estates in general. Previously, such holdings yielded at least enough to fund loans on the large debts and mortgages usually undertaken to fund a lavish lifestyle, often spent both in the country estate and in large houses in London.|$|E

That law was extensive in scope, encompassing settlement and removal, apprenticeship, illegitimacy, parochial rating and taxation, as well as welfare and unemployment provision. It continually swayed the rural labour market. It underlay the development of so-called ‘open’ and ‘close’ parishes, or as I would prefer to express it, the maintenance of a number of parishes (or hamlets or townships) as fundamentally estate units. It was an essential element in tenant farmers' judgements on profitability, and was routinely discussed in the General Views of Agriculture. Like the overhang of a George Morland tree, sometimes clutching, sometimes benign, it extended far over the lives of that majority of village inhabitants termed the ‘labouring poor’. Commentators like Arthur Young, John Howlett or Sir Frederick Eden discussed the poor law in the same paragraphs as they wrote about enclosure, <b>agricultural</b> improvement, <b>depression</b> and rural social relations. They paid close attention to poor-relief, making extensive connections between the poor law, rural poverty, rents, and agricultural innovation. To them such matters were closely entwined...|$|R
25|$|Cha (2007) {{analyzes}} a panel {{data set}} {{to explore how}} industrial revolution, demographic transition, and human capital accumulation interacted in Korea from 1916–38. Income growth and public investment in health caused mortality to fall, which suppressed fertility and promoted education. Industrialization, skill premium, and closing gender wage gap further induced parents to opt for child quality. Expanding demand for education was accommodated by an active public school building program. The interwar <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> aggravated traditional income inequality, raising fertility and impeding the spread of mass schooling. Landlordism collapsed {{in the wake of}} de-colonization, and the consequent reduction in inequality accelerated human and physical capital accumulation, hence leading to growth in South Korea.|$|E
25|$|Continuing {{to rely on}} {{agriculture}} in a declining market, landowners in the state struggled with the change to free labor, {{as well as the}} aftermath of the war's destruction. There was an <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> and deep financial recession in 1873, and changes in the labor market disrupted agriculture. South Carolina lost proportionally more of its young men of fighting age than did any other Southern state. Recorded deaths were 18,666; however, fatalities might have reached 21,146. This was 31–35% of the total of white men of ages 18–45 recorded in the 1860 census for South Carolina. As with other military forces, most of the men died of disease rather than being wounded in battle.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, the {{worsening}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling {{to stay in}} power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that disfranchised blacks and poor whites. Democrats wanted to prevent their alliance. In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a literacy test, knowing that it would exclude many blacks and whites. At the time when more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892, they amended the state constitution to require a poll tax and more complex residency requirements, both of which adversely affected poor people and sharecroppers, forcing most blacks and many poor whites from voter rolls.|$|E

25|$|After the 1873 <b>depression,</b> <b>agricultural</b> and {{industrial}} groups lobbied for protective tariffs. The 1879 tariffs protected these interests, stimulated economic revival through state intervention and refurbished {{political support for}} the conservative politicians Bismarck and John A. Macdonald (the Canadian prime minister). Chancellor Bismarck gradually veered away from classical liberal economic policies in the 1870s, embracing many conservative and progressive policies, including high tariffs, nationalization of railroads, and compulsory social insurance. This political and economic nationalism also reduced {{the fortunes of the}} German and Canadian classical liberal parties. France, like Britain, also entered into a prolonged stagnation that extended to 1897. The French also attempted to deal with their economic problems through the implementation of tariffs. New French laws in 1880 and in 1892 imposed stiff tariffs on many agricultural {{and industrial}} imports, an attempt at protectionism. The U.S., still in the period after the Civil War, continued to be very protectionist.|$|R

Battalion members who survived combat were taken prisoner and endured brutal treatment in prisoner of war camps. In 1942, the Victory Loan Campaign staged a mock Nazi invasion of Winnipeg to promote awareness of the stakes of the war in Europe. When the war ended, pent-up demand generated a boom in housing development, although building activity was checked by the 1950 Red River flood. The federal government estimated damage at over $26 million, although the province indicated that it was at least double that.|$|R
25|$|Lynchings were public {{demonstrations of}} white {{power and a}} means to exert social control. Racial {{tensions}} had an economic base. In attempting to reconstruct the plantation economy, planters were anxious to control labor. In addition, <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> was widespread, {{and the price of}} cotton kept falling after the Civil War into the 1890s. A labor shortage occurred {{in many parts of the}} Deep South, most especially in the Mississippi Delta, which was being rapidly developed for agriculture. Southern attempts to recruit immigrant labor were unsuccessful, as immigrants would quickly leave field labor. Lynchings erupted when farmers tried to terrorize the laborers, especially when time came to settle and they were unable to pay wages, but tried to keep laborers from leaving.|$|E
25|$|However, a fresh dispute {{began as}} Lord Petre protested at the {{inadequate}} sum awarded {{to him as}} compensation {{for the loss of}} agricultural land. Construction workers were ordered from his estates. Lord Petre sought a sum of £20,000 for the land required by the railway company, and a payment of a further £100,000 in compensation. The Eastern Counties Railway Company protested at the latter claim, insisting that a panel of surveyors had considered £20,000 a fair total (over £1million today). The dispute persisted, but after a period of deadlock, Lord Petre won his case and the railway company paid him six times the compensation originally offered. The money was invested in an agricultural estate in the Dengie Peninsula but with the onset of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression</b> of the 1880s the investment proved disastrous.|$|E
25|$|After the Civil War, the South {{was devastated}} {{in terms of}} population, {{infrastructure}} and economy. Because of states' reluctance to grant voting rights to freedmen, Congress instituted Reconstruction governments. It established military districts and governors to rule over the South until new governments could be established. Many white Southerners who had actively supported the Confederacy were temporarily disenfranchised. Rebuilding was difficult as people grappled {{with the effects of}} a new labor economy of a free market {{in the midst of a}} widespread <b>agricultural</b> <b>depression.</b> In addition, what limited infrastructure the South had was mostly destroyed by the war. At the same time, the North was rapidly industrializing. To avoid the social effects of the war, most of the Southern states initially passed black codes. Eventually, these were mostly legally nullified by federal law and anti-Confederate legislatures, which existed for a short time during Reconstruction.|$|E
5000|$|An arc of provinces at the {{southern}} edge of the Central Agricultural Zone was where the agrarian violence - the peasants' war against the squires - of the revolution was concentrated, presenting a distinctive distribution: from Samara and Saratov, through Tambov, Voronezh, Kursk, Kharkov, Chernigov, Ekaterinoslav, Kherson and Poltava, all the way to Kiev and Podolia in the southwest. This 'transitional region' of overpopulation and large landownership by the gentry, with high land rents and low wages, but with fertile soil and decently long growing seasons favourable to the development of commercial mechanised farming and cultivation of wheat, sugar-beet, etc. were, according to Figes, 'caught in the worst of all possible worlds: between the old pre-capitalist system of agriculture in the centre, and the emergent system of commercial farming at the periphery'. Though at extortionate prices, the leasing of land from the gentry managed most peasants to just about survive during the economic <b>agricultural</b> price <b>depression</b> between 1876 to 1896. As the price of cereals rose and the price of transportation fell, however, many landowners turned their estates into commercial farms, greatly increasing the share of landownership by the gentry between 1900 and 1914 (an increase of one third, but even higher in the 'transitional regions', like in Poltava Province where their share doubled). This resulted in rented out land being withdrawn, or rented out at even higher prices, and the lease system being altered from a money rent to labour rent (otrabotka), perceived by the peasants as a new form of serfdom. With a modernisation of their farms, the need for peasant labour also decreased, reducing wages in the process. Within the final decades of the Russian Empire, millions of peasants had been driven off the land due to poverty, or a misfortune like the death of a family member, which was very difficult to handle economically for a severely indebted household.|$|R
5000|$|The line did {{initially}} {{deal with}} substantial goods traffic: nearly 20,000 tons of coal {{a year and}} 5,000 tons annually of Lowestoft fish traffic, around 10% of the total generated. [...] and Gorleston North stations became important coal depots, while potential for new traffic {{was created by the}} construction of a sugar beet shoot at Hopton-on-Sea in 1913. In the same year, a new 12-coach spur was installed at Gorleston-on-Sea to accommodate passengers for the Suffolk Show. A new station was opened at [...] in 1914 to serve the adjacent golf club which paid the costs of construction. Fish traffic declined during the First World War, but overall goods traffic increased as a result of war requirements and the diversion to rail of traditionally seaborne traffic to Yarmouth, Lynn and Wisbech. The volume of goods carried by rail declined significantly in the post-war period due to <b>agricultural</b> and industrial <b>depression,</b> coupled with the growth of road competition to which the line was vulnerable due to the short distances over which traffic was conveyed. Between 1923 and 1936 the M&GN provided the goods service over the line which consisted of two or three trains per day together with fish trains. The denationalisation of road transport by the Transport Act 1953 dealt a further blow to goods traffic by facilitating long-distance transportation by motor vehicles.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} appraises {{the role}} of white, middle-class businessmen as engineers of urban development, assessing the complexity of individual and group reactions to an array of economic, political, social, and environmental stimuli that residents of Kansas faced between 1870 and 1929 using Abilene, Wichita, and Dodge City as case studies. I explore the social dynamics that evolved among these local businessmen – {{as well as with}} other townspeople and those who lived outside their communities – to consider how these social interactions affected each town’s urban aspirations. This study traces the process of town-building from its inception when Abilene, Wichita, and Dodge City became cattle towns; through the towns’ transition into commercial centers during the boom of the 1880 s; their struggles to negotiate the <b>agricultural</b> and economic <b>depression</b> of the 1890 s; and their resurgence in the early 1900 s. Over the period of sixty years, businessmen responded to major shifts in the surrounding agricultural economy; regional and national politics; and evolving transportation systems. In examining how these men negotiated with one another, with other residents, and with their rural neighbors to respond to these changes, I conclude that the communities that proffered the most cogent visions for development – and those which devised the most solid strategies and programs to achieve these plans – were those where businessmen actively and consistently collaborated with one another. In so doing, I identify local promotional organizations as an important site for sustained collaboration and explore early formal and informal attempts to establish these groups, while examining how collaboration became increasingly institutionalized in {{the first decades of the}} twentieth century...|$|R
