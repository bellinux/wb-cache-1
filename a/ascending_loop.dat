Electron microscopy has shown (see Rhodin (1)) that these membranes separate adjacent cells where they interlock with one another by multiple cytoplasmic lamellae containing oriented mitochondria. The significance of the high ATPase activity is considered in relation to possible movements of the membranes and to "active transport" believed to occur there. In the rat, enzyme activity in the proximal tubule membranes does not survive formol-calcium fixation, and it is therefore necessary to use unfixed sections for its demonstration. However, in edematous rats with experimental nephrosis (induced by the injection of aminonucleoside or with antikidney serum) marked ATPase activity is exhibited in these membranes even after formol-calcium fixation. When proximal tubule or Henle loop cells of the dog acquire an altered metabolism, as indicated by accumulated lipide spheres or by "droplets," the infolded ATPase-rich membranes are no longer demonstrable...|$|R

50|$|The {{proposed}} {{mechanism for}} this phenomenon {{does not include}} a reduced sensitivity of mineralocorticoid receptors to aldosterone, because low serum potassium is often seen in these patients, which is {{the direct result of}} aldosterone-induced expression of ENaC channels. Furthermore, electrolyte homeostasis is maintained in these patients, which excludes the possibility that other Na+ transporters elsewhere in the kidney are being shut down. If, in fact, other transporters such as the Na+-H+ antiporter in the proximal tubule or the Na+/K+/2Cl− symporter in the thick <b>ascending</b> <b>loop</b> of Henle were being blocked, other electrolyte disturbances would be expected, such as seen during use of diuretics.|$|E

This is large {{in comparison to}} normal renal sodium reabsorption which leaves only about 0.4% of filtered sodium in the urine. Loop diuretics have this ability, and are therefore often synonymous with high ceiling diuretics.

40|$|Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are {{the most}} {{spectacular}} eruptive phenomena in the solar atmosphere. It is generally accepted that CMEs are results of eruptions of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs). However, a heated debate is on whether MFRs pre-exist before the eruptions or they are formed during the eruptions. Several coronal signatures, e. g., filaments, coronal cavities, sigmoid structures and hot channels (or hot blobs), are proposed as MFRs and observed before the eruption, which support the pre-existing MFR scenario. There is almost no reported observation about MFR formation during the eruption. In this letter, we present an intriguing observation of a solar eruptive event occurred on 2013 November 21 with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory, which shows a detailed formation process of the MFR during the eruption. The process started with the expansion of a low-lying coronal arcade, possibly caused by the flare magnetic reconnection underneath. The newly-formed <b>ascending</b> <b>loops</b> from below further pushed the arcade upward, stretching the surrounding magnetic field. The arcade and stretched magnetic field lines then curved-in just below the arcade vertex, forming an X-point. The field lines near the X-point continued to approach each other and a second magnetic reconnection was induced. It is this high-lying magnetic reconnection {{that led to the}} formation and eruption of a hot blob (∼ 10 MK), presumably a MFR, producing a CME. We suggest that two spatially-separated magnetic reconnections occurred in this event, responsible for producing the flare and the hot blob (CME), respectively.

We analyzed cardiac morphogenesis in immunohistochemically and hybridohistochemically stained and three-dimensionally reconstructed serial sections of CX 43 -deficient embryos between embryonic day (ED) 10 and birth. The establishment of the D configuration in the <b>ascending</b> <b>loop</b> of CX 43 -deficient hearts is markedly retarded, so that the right ventricle retains a craniomedial position and is connected with the outflow tract by a more acute bend in ED 10 and ED 11 embryos. Because of the subsequent growth of the right ventricle, this condition usually evolves into a D loop, but when it persists, a "crisscross" configuration develops, with the atrioventricular cushions rotated 90 degrees, a horizontal muscular ventricular septum, and a parallel course of the endocardial ridges of the outflow tract. After ED 12, large intertrabecular pouches develop at the ventricular side of both shelflike myocardial structures that support the endocardial ridges of the outflow tract, ie, at the location that was earlier characterized by the acute bend between the right ventricle and the outflow tract and that subsequently develops into the anterosuperior leaflet of the tricuspid valve.

40|$|Abstract Objective The {{effect of}} end-to-side {{neurotization}} of partially regenerated recipient nerves on improving motor power in late obstetric brachial plexus lesions, so-called nerve augmentation, was investigated. Methods Eight cases aged 3 – 7 years were operated upon and followed up {{for 4 years}} (C 5, 6 rupture C 7, 8 T 1 avulsion: 5; C 5, 6, 7, 8 rupture T 1 avulsion: 1; C 5, 6, 8 T 1 rupture C 7 avulsion: 1; C 5, 6, 7 ruptureC 8 T 1 compression: one 3 year presentation after former neurotization at 3 months). Grade 1 – 3 muscles were neurotized. Grade 0 muscles were neurotized, if the electromyogram showed scattered motor unit action potentials on voluntary contraction without interference pattern. Donor nerves included: the phrenic, accessory, descending and <b>ascending</b> <b>loops</b> of the ansa cervicalis, 3 rd and 4 th intercostals and contralateral C 7. Results Superior proximal to distal regeneration was observed firstly. Differential regeneration of muscles supplied by the same nerve was observed secondly (superior supraspinatus to infraspinatus regeneration). Differential regeneration of antagonistic muscles was observed thirdly (superior biceps to triceps and pronator teres to supinator recovery). Differential regeneration of fibres within the same muscle was observed fourthly (superior anterior and middle to posterior deltoid regeneration). Differential regeneration of muscles having different preoperative motor powers was noted fifthly; improvement to Grade 3 or more occurred more in Grade 2 than in Grade 0 or Grade 1 muscles. Improvements of cocontractions and of shoulder, forearm and wrist deformities were noted sixthly. The shoulder, elbow and hand scores improved in 4 cases. Limitations The sample size is small. Controls are necessary to rule out any natural improvement of the lesion. There is intra- and interobserver variability in testing muscle power and cocontractions. Conclusion Nerve augmentation improves cocontractions and muscle power in the biceps, pectoral muscles, supraspinatus, anterior and lateral deltoids, triceps and in Grade 2 or more forearm muscles. As it is less expected to improve infraspinatus power, it should {{be associated with a}} humeral derotation osteotomy and tendon transfer. Function to non improving Grade 0 or 1 forearm muscles should be restored by muscle transplantation. Level of evidence Level IV, prospective case series. </p...|$|R

40|$|The pck rat: A {{new model}} that resembles human {{autosomal}} dominant polycystic kidney and liver disease. BackgroundThe pck rat is a recently identified model of {{polycystic kidney disease}} (PKD) and liver disease (PLD) that developed spontaneously in the rat strain Crj:CD/SD. Its pattern of inheritance is autosomal recessive. MethodsTo characterize this new model, we studied pck rats derived from F 9 breeding pairs from Charles River Japan and control Sprague-Dawley rats. Blood and tissues (kidneys, liver, and pancreas), obtained from these rats at 1, 7, 21, 70, and 182 days of age, were used for biochemical determinations, light and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. ResultsThe pck rats develop progressive cystic enlargement of the kidneys after {{the first week of}} age, and liver cysts are evident by day 1. The renal cysts developed as a focal process from thick <b>ascending</b> <b>loops</b> of Henle, distal tubules, and collecting ducts in the corticomedullary region and outer medulla. Flat and polypoid epithelial hyperplasia were common in dilated tubules and cysts. Apoptosis was common and affected normal, as well as dilated tubules, but less frequently cysts lined by flat epithelium. The basement membranes of the cyst walls exhibited a variety of alterations, including thinning, lamellation, and thickening. Focal interstitial fibrosis and inflammation were evident by 70 days of age. Segmental glomerulosclerosis and segmental thickening of the basement membrane with associated effacement of the podocyte foot processes were noted in some rats at 70 days of age. The PKD was more severe in male than in female pck rats, as reflected by the higher kidney weights, while there was no gender difference in the severity of the PLD. Mild bile duct dilation was present as early as one day of age. With age, it became more severe, and the livers became markedly enlarged. Even then, however, there was only a mild increase in portal fibrosis, without formation of fibrous septae. Slight elevations of plasma blood urea nitrogen levels were detected at 70 and 182 days of age. ConclusionsThe pck rat is a new inherited model of PKD and PLD with a natural history and renal and hepatic histologic abnormalities that resemble human autosomal dominant PKD. This model may be useful for studying the pathogenesis and evaluating the potential therapies for PKD and PLD. The identification of the pck gene may provide further insight into the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant PKD...|$|R
50|$|The {{ascending}} limb of {{the loop}} of Henle receives an even lower volume of fluid and has different characteristics compared to the descending limb. In the <b>ascending</b> portion, the <b>loop</b> becomes impermeable to water and the cells {{of the loop}} actively reabsorb solutes from the luminal fluid; therefore water is not reabsorbed and ions are readily reabsorbed. As ions leave the lumen via the Na-K-2Cl symporter and the Na-H antiporter, the concentration becomes more and more hypotonic until it reaches approximately 100-150 mOsm/L. The ascending limb is also called the diluting segment of the nephron because of its ability to dilute the fluid in the loop from 1200 mOsm/L to 100 mOsm/L.|$|R
40|$|Standard {{model of}} solar flares {{comprises}} a bulk expansion and rise of abruptly heated plasma (the chromospheric evaporation). Emission from plasma <b>ascending</b> along <b>loops</b> rooted on the visible solar disk should be often dominated, at least temporally, by a blue-shifted emission. However, {{there is only}} a very limited number of published observations of solar flares having spectra in which the blue-shifted component dominates the stationary one. In this work we compare observed X-ray spectra of three solar flares recorded during their impulsive phases and relevant synthetic spectra calculated using one-dimensional hydro-dynamic numerical model of these flares. The main aim of the work was to explain why numerous flares do not show blue-shifted spectra. The synthesized BCS spectra of the flares were compared with the relevant observed BCS spectra. We conclude that stationary component of the spectrum should be observed almost for all flares during their early phases of evolution. In opposite, the blue-shifted component of the spectrum could be not detected in flares having plasma rising along the flaring loop even with high velocity due to the geometrical dependences only. After the start of the up-flow motion, the blue-shifted component dominate temporally the synthetic spectra of the investigated flares at their early phases.
