5|$|Early in this film, Denham {{shoots a}} scene for his film in which Ann, in-character, proclaims she's {{never been on}} a ship before, and Bruce Baxter improvises lines proclaiming annoyance.

Ironically, in this film, Jack Driscoll expresses disapproval of such words toward Ann.|$|E

5|$|Reception for {{individual}} elements of Zombiepowder. was more mixed. The series premise of seeking magical items was criticized as cliche by <b>ANN</b> <b>and</b> IGN, but deemed {{sufficient for the}} needs of the story by AMO, and the parasitic nature of the rings and zombie powder themselves were complimented by MangaCast and IGN for lending suspense to the plot. The setting was criticized by <b>ANN</b> <b>and</b> Gorban alike for not having much effort put into it, being too similar to Trigun, and seeming to be chosen {{just for the sake of}} coolness, while IGN liked the mixture of the old west, arcane, and technological. The quality of individual characters in the series was again considered a mixed bag, both in artistic design and characterization, but with a consensus across reviews that the characters were not developed much beyond their respective tropes.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{adaptive}} neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) {{and artificial}} neural networks (ANNs) techniques are developed {{and applied to}} identify damage in a model steel girder bridge using dynamic parameters.

A comparative study is made using the <b>ANNs</b> <b>and</b> ANFIS techniques and results showed that both ANFIS <b>and</b> <b>ANN</b> present good predictions. However the proposed ANFIS architecture using hybrid learning algorithm was found to perform better than the multilayer feedforward ANN which learns using the backpropagation algorithm.

5|$|Jennings {{had been}} a heavy drinker of alcohol {{for much of his}} life. His {{addiction}} worsened {{after the death of his}} first wife, <b>Ann,</b> <b>and</b> his development of rheumatism. Jennings's alcoholism led to defeat in his reelection campaign in 1830. In retirement his condition worsened and he was unable to work his farm. When his finances collapsed, his creditors sought to take his land holdings and Charlestown farm. To protect his friend, U.S. Senator John Tipton purchased Jennings's farm and permitted him to continue living there. After Jennings's death, his estate was sold, but it left no funds to purchase a headstone for his grave, which remained unmarked for fifty-seven years.|$|E

Fleeing from the scene, Gil discovers his new appearance.

Stern suggests that Gil can control his symptoms by staying {{in the dark and}} remaining in the hospital, but admits that the patient cannot be held against his will.|$|E
