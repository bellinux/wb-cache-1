5|$|A typical 100-g parsnip {{contains}} 75 Calories (230 kJ) of energy. Most parsnip cultivars {{consist of}} about 80% water, 5% sugar, 1% protein, 0.3% fat, and 5% dietary fiber. The parsnip {{is rich in}} vitamins <b>and</b> <b>minerals,</b> and is particularly rich in potassium with 375mg per 100g. Several of the B-group vitamins are present, but levels of vitamin C are reduced in cooking. Since most of the vitamins <b>and</b> <b>minerals</b> are found close to the skin, many will be lost unless the root is finely peeled or cooked whole. During frosty weather, part of the starch is converted to sugar and the root tastes sweeter.|$|E

40|$|The {{conceptual}} understandings of rock <b>and</b> <b>mineral</b> were examined for first-year {{junior high school}} students by analyzing concept maps, a test on rock names and a questionnaire on rock <b>and</b> <b>mineral.</b> Their understandings of rock <b>and</b> <b>mineral</b> were categorized into four groups defined by correct and incorrect understandings of the material and terminological structures of rock <b>and</b> <b>mineral.</b> The students of the group defined by correct understanding of the material structure and incorrect understanding of the terminological structure think the terminological structure of rock <b>and</b> <b>mineral</b> as same as the material structure. Because minerals are materially included in rocks, they regard minerals {{as a sort of}} rocks. This misconception was possibly acquired through the lesson on the material structure of rock <b>and</b> <b>mineral.</b> For correct understanding of rock <b>and</b> <b>mineral,</b> students have to learn both the material and terminological structures of rock <b>and</b> <b>mineral.</b> 中学 1 年生の岩石・鉱物の理解の仕方を岩石名調査，コンセプトマップ調査及びアンケート調査により調べた．その結果，生徒たちの岩石・鉱物に対する理解は，岩石・鉱物の物質的な構造の理解・不理解とそれらの用語の構造の理解・不理解の組み合わせで定義される四つのグループの中に位置づけられることが分かった．そして，そのうち，岩石・鉱物の物質的な構造の理解と用語の構造の不理解で定義されるグループに属する生徒の多くは，用語の構造を物質的な構造と同様に理解していることが分かった．そのような理解は岩石と鉱物の物質的な構造の学習により強化されたものと考えられる．学習者が岩石と鉱物を正しく理解するため，岩石と鉱物を混同しないためには，物質的な構造の学習のみでは不十分であり，岩石と鉱物の用語の構造の学習を伴わなければならない...|$|R

5|$|Well-known human vitamin {{deficiencies}} involve thiamine (beriberi), niacin (pellagra), vitamin C (scurvy), {{and vitamin}} D (rickets).

5|$|As omnivores, Campbell's dwarf hamsters eat {{a variety}} of {{different}} foods. A balanced diet for a hamster consists of 16-24% protein, 60-65% carbohydrates, and 5–7% fat, with constant access to fresh water. In their natural habitats, dwarf hamsters feed almost exclusively on plant materials. In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters can get the required nutrition from commercially available food designed specifically for hamsters, which typically contain a mix of dry grains, nuts, and seeds that may be fortified with vitamins <b>and</b> <b>minerals.</b> An excess of any one particular seed or nut can lead to digestive problems, obesity, and forms nutritional deficiency.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} 19thcentury, the Oregon Trail, a pioneer trail {{of which a}} major portion {{followed}} the Snake River, had been established by aspiring settlers and traders. Steamboats and railroads moved agricultural products <b>and</b> <b>minerals</b> along the river throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. The powerful, steep flow of the Snake River has been used since the 1890s to generate hydroelectricity, enhance navigation, and provide irrigation water from fifteen major dams built on the lower river, transforming it {{into a series of}} reservoirs. Several of these have been proposed for removal in order to restore some of the river's once-tremendous salmon runs.|$|E

5|$|For pharmacology, Shen {{wrote of}} the {{difficulties}} of adequate diagnosis and therapy, {{as well as the}} proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs. He held great concern for detail and philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of horticulture. In the realms of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, <b>and</b> <b>minerals</b> found in China. For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{depend on}} plants for food, either {{directly}} or as feed for domestic animals. Agriculture deals with the production of food crops, and has {{played a key role}} in the history of world civilizations. Agriculture includes agronomy for arable crops, horticulture for vegetables and fruit, and forestry for timber. About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major staples include cereals such as rice and wheat, starchy roots and tubers such as cassava and potato, and legumes such as peas and beans. Vegetable oils such as olive oil provide lipids, while fruit and vegetables contribute vitamins <b>and</b> <b>minerals</b> to the diet.|$|E

5|$|Juveniles of some spiders in the {{families}} Anyphaenidae, Corinnidae, Clubionidae, Thomisidae and Salticidae feed on plant nectar. Laboratory {{studies show that}} they do so deliberately and over extended periods, and periodically clean themselves while feeding. These spiders also prefer sugar solutions to plain water, which indicates that they are seeking nutrients. Since many spiders are nocturnal, the extent of nectar consumption by spiders may have been underestimated. Nectar contains amino acids, lipids, vitamins <b>and</b> <b>minerals</b> in addition to sugars, and {{studies have shown that}} other spider species live longer when nectar is available. Feeding on nectar avoids the risks of struggles with prey, and the costs of producing venom and digestive enzymes.|$|E
