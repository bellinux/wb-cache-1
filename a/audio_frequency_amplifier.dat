50|$|A tuned radio {{frequency}} receiver (or TRF receiver) {{is a type}} of radio receiver that is composed of one or more tuned {{radio frequency}} (RF) amplifier stages followed by a detector (demodulator) circuit to extract the audio signal and usually an <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>amplifier.</b> This type of receiver was popular in the 1920s. Early examples could be tedious to operate because when tuning in a station each stage had to be individually adjusted to the station's frequency, but later models had ganged tuning, the tuning mechanisms of all stages being linked together, and operated by just one control knob. By the mid 1930s, it was replaced by the superheterodyne receiver patented by Edwin Armstrong.|$|E
5000|$|A class-A {{push-pull}} amplifier produces low distortion {{for any given}} level of applied feedback, and also cancels the flux in the transformer cores, so this topology is often seen by HIFI-audio enthusiasts and do-it-yourself builders as the ultimate engineering approach to the tube Hi-fi amplifier for use with normal speakers. Output power of as high as 15 watts can be achieved even with classic tubes such as the 2A3 or 18 watts from the type 45. Classic pentodes such as the EL34 and KT88 can output as much as 60 and 100 watts respectively. Special types such as the V1505 {{can be used in}} designs rated at up to 1100 watts.

40|$|Certain {{laboratory}} measurements {{require the}} use of a selective <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The limitations of physical size on conventional circuits become important in this frequency range. It is necessary to consider selectivity ease of tuning, economy of components, and stability, in the comparison of various types of amplifiers which operate in the range below 20, 000 cycles per second. At radio frequencies, use of the parallel resonant circuit as a selective load impedance for a vacuum tube is highly satisfactory. (Figure 1) When the frequency of resonance is decreased, the product of the inductance and capacitance must be increased inversely as the square of the frequency. It becomes difficult to produce variable condensers with a large enough capacity to cover the range desired. In order to obtain the required value of inductance, iron cored inductors must be used. These have greater losses than air cored inductances, and require careful design to avoid change of inductance due to variable permeability. It becomes essential at low audio frequencies to employ other circuits. Inverse feedback or degenerative amplifiers, (Figure 2) using selective networks that reject one frequency fulfill the requirements. The gain of a feedback amplifier is (la, 2 a) : G = A / 1 - ßA.

Reducing power consumption in <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> power <b>amplifiers</b> (AFPAs) [4] of forward-looking sonar system [5] remains a great challenge. Some solutions are proposed to solve this problem, such as GaN-based gate driver circuit and power conditioning circuit [6]. These solutions need extra hardware design based on pulse-width modulation (PWM) [7] to improve the efficiency of AFPA.

40|$|The radio <b>frequency</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{differ from}} <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{in the choice}} of values and the circuit elements. In most {{applications}} of the microwave amplifiers not only high amplification is desirable, but the usable bandwidth should be as great as possible. The ordinary amplifiers can not operate at microwave ranges because of their inherent parasitic parameters and thus, it is necessary to design a Microwave Amplifiers, which is free from above bottlenecks. This work concerns with the design of low noise microwave amplifier using Transistors. Microwave transistors are essentially scaled-down version of low frequency transistors. They find applications as local oscillators for radars and as radio frequency sources for low power transmitters apart from low noise microwave amplifiers. Most microwave bipolar transistors are generally Silicon n-p-n devices. The design objective in this work is of two fold: 1) Determination of scattering parameters from a given set of power gains and noise figure. The design is, however, based on a single operating frequency. This, of course, can function well within a small band of frequencies with a centre frequency equals to the operating frequency. 2) Determination of performance index of a microwave amplifier, that is, Noise Figure(F), Gain(gp), Voltage standing wave ratio at input and at out put. Also the detail calculations are presented in chapter- 3; it is worthwhile to mention that the design problem undertaken satisfies the need of an amplifier, which can be used for microwave applications...|$|R
40|$|Methods of {{minimizing}} {{the effects of}} internally generated noise in transistor amplifiers are described. The study is both theoretical and experimental in nature, {{the greater part of}} the theoretical portion being based on van der Ziel’s transistor noise model. From this model, analytical expressions are formulated giving (in terms of easily measurable transistor parameters) the operating point and source resistance that will optimize the noise performance of the amplifier. The derived equations are substantiated by an experimental study. Both <b>audio</b> and radio <b>frequency</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are considered. At <b>audio</b> <b>frequencies,</b> the work is primarily experimental in nature. Here, attention is focused on developing a simplified optimization procedure. For the radio <b>frequency</b> <b>amplifier,</b> formulas are also derived that describe the effect of source reactance on the amplifier’s noise performance. Formulas giving the noise figures of the transformer- coupled transistor amplifier are included. From these equations, analytical expressions are formulated that describe the emitter current and transformer turns ratio which will minimize the effects of internally generated noise. An experimental investigation verified the results. A portion of the work is devoted to a theoretical and experimental study of temperature and its effect on the noise performance of transistor amplifiers. This study, which considers temperatures from 77 to 320 ° K, differs from those previously conducted in that a wide range of source resistances are used. Equations describing the degradation in noise performance produced by resistive stabilizing components are given. Also included is an analytical description of the methods used to obtain noise-factor measurements. ...|$|R

The 2N170 was priced slightly higher than the 2N107. The 2N170 was a fallout from the 2N167, 2N168 and 2N169 transistor lines.
