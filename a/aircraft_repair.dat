5|$|Crawley {{was already}} a modest {{industrial}} centre {{by the end of}} the Second World War. Building was an important trade: 800 people were employed by building and joinery firms, and two—Longley's and Cook's—were large enough to have their own factories. In 1949, 1,529 people worked in manufacturing: the main industries were light and precision engineering and <b>aircraft</b> <b>repair.</b> Many of the jobs in these industries were highly skilled.|$|E
5|$|MiG-3 {{production}} at Zavod Nr. 1 {{had already been}} planned to be reduced from a NKAP order of 27 August that required the factory to produce 420 fighters in September, declining to 100 in December with Il-2 production ramping up to 250 in December while the former <b>aircraft</b> <b>repair</b> plant at Khodynka Aerodrome was {{to be transferred to}} the NKAP, redesignated as Zavod Nr. 165, and begin production of MiG-3s. The German advance disrupted these plans for Zavod 165 and it never produced a single MiG-3.|$|E

5|$|Few crashes {{have been}} {{attributed}} to design flaws of the 747. The Tenerife airport disaster resulted from pilot error and communications failure, while the Japan Airlines Flight 123 and China Airlines Flight 611 crashes stemmed from improper <b>aircraft</b> <b>repair.</b> United Airlines Flight 811, which suffered an explosive decompression mid-flight on February 24, 1989, led the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to issue a recommendation that 747-200 cargo doors similar to those on the Flight 811 aircraft be modified. Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down by a Soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 after it had strayed into Soviet territory, causing U.S. President Ronald Reagan to authorize the then-strictly military global positioning system (GPS) for civilian use.|$|E
5|$|In September 1917, Allingham, by then an Air Mechanic First Class, {{was posted}} to the Western Front to join No. 12 Squadron RNAS.

When Allingham arrived at Petite-Synthe, both the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the RNAS {{were involved in the}} Ypres offensive. Allingham also instrumented the very first reconnaissance aircraft camera during the First World War. On 3 November 1917, he was posted to the aircraft depot at Dunkirk, France where he remained {{for the rest of the}} war, on <b>aircraft</b> <b>repair</b> and recovery duties. He recalls being bombed from the air and shelled from both the land and the sea.|$|E
5|$|Mackinolty was {{promoted}} {{in the field}} to flight sergeant in June 1916, and mentioned in despatches on 19October. When the Australian members of No.30 Squadron were dispersed, he was posted to Kantara, Egypt, where he joined the newly established No.2 Squadron AFC (also numbered No.68 Squadron RFC by the British). Commanded by Major Oswald Watt, the unit relocated to England in January 1917. Following his service with No.2 Squadron, Mackinolty was assigned to No.5 (Training) Squadron AFC, which formed at Shawbury, Shropshire, in June 1917. Praised for his organisational and leadership abilities, he was commissioned as an equipment officer in March 1918, with the rank of second lieutenant. The following month he was given command of an <b>aircraft</b> <b>repair</b> unit in Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire, home of two squadrons of the AFC's 1st Training Wing.|$|E

5|$|HMS Unicorn was an <b>{{aircraft}}</b> <b>repair</b> {{ship and}} light aircraft carrier {{built for the}} Royal Navy in the late 1930s. She was completed during World War II and provided air cover over the amphibious landing at Salerno, Italy in September 1943.

Unicorn supported the aircraft carriers of the fleet on their operations until the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) was formed in November 1944. She was transferred to Australia in early 1945 to support the BPF's operations during Operation Iceberg, the Allied invasion of Okinawa in May. To shorten the time required to replenish the BPF's carriers, the ship was based in the Admiralty Islands and in the Philippine Islands until the Japanese surrender in August. Unicorn was decommissioned and placed in reserve when she returned to the UK in January 1946.|$|E
