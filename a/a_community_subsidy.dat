50|$|OBA {{generally}} works {{through a}} private firm, or another third party, {{acting as the}} service provider. The service provider {{is responsible for the}} initial financing of the project and, only after results have been verified, will the firm receive subsidies from a donor. In such schemes, it is the provider who bears the risk of loss, rather than the aid donor, and output-based schemes allow for the tracking of results {{because of the way they}} function. Integration of the private sector into aid schemes is common with OBA, since they often provide the initial financing. The World Bank sees OBA as a way to improve aid effectiveness. This differs from traditional aid schemes that will usually focus on the inputs to service providers rather than the outputs. The donor is usually the World Bank, a government or an international organization or philanthropist that is part of the OBA scheme. Subsidies from a donor will generally serve to complement or reduce user fees. The subsidy is paid only after the particular service has been delivered to <b>a</b> <b>community.</b> The <b>subsidies</b> are targeted to poorer individuals, since OBA initiatives are carried out in regions with significant amounts of poverty.|$|R

They aim to enhance children’s educational performance by offering extended educational and social services. <b>As</b> <b>community</b> schools mainly focus on disadvantaged children, this study evaluates the effects of community schooling on the educational outcomes of these pupils. We focus on care pupils and pupils whose parents have a low educational attainment. We hypothesize that community schools are particularly beneficial to care pupils, namely, pupils with additional educational needs, and for pupils with parents {{with lower levels of}} educational attainment. Our analyses show that both pupil groups benefit in terms of reduced underachievement. The duration of community school attendance as such does not affect cognitive outcomes, but it proves beneficial to the educational achievement of both groups when the <b>community</b> school <b>subsidy</b> is taken into account as well. We show that different community school activities have partly contrary effects on care pupils and non-care pupils...|$|R

40|$|Libraries are artifact-bound institutions, and as such, will be {{replaced}} as the dominant technology for information communication moves from tangible objects to electronic bits on a network. As this transition occurs, {{it is important to}} understand not what libraries have done, but rather what they are for. Libraries make information easily, publicly, and cheaply available. They are the means through which organizations and communities subsidize the distribution of information to residents and members. Without such support, information is underused, and its potential benefit is lost. As the library fades as the channel for this subsidy, it is critical that the subsidy itself is not lost. If it is, our organizations will be less effective and our communities poorer. By understanding these issues, librarians can shape the information economy so that institutional and <b>community</b> <b>subsidy</b> is maintained, and new technologies enhance and extend information availability. If preserving the library as an institution is our focus, we will fail in these tasks...|$|R

A field-test and a psychological experiment using <b>a</b> <b>community</b> support system {{are important for}} investigating activities in <b>a</b> <b>community.</b> Existing community support systems, however, have limitations on having an experiment smoothly because few systems consider functions for supporting an experiment. To investigate activities in <b>a</b> <b>community</b> smoothly, community support systems should have community {{analysis and}} maintenance functions that support an analyst and <b>a</b> <b>community</b> organizer in <b>an</b> experiment. We implemented those functions in the POC system, and used in a field-test and a social psychological experiment. From these experiments, we found that proposed functions enabled an analyst and <b>a</b> <b>community</b> organizer to (1) find up-to-date state of <b>a</b> <b>community</b> during <b>an</b> experiment, (2) analyze relations between messages efficiently and objectively, and (3) maintain communities easily. Requirements for the functions, implementation, and experience in the experiments are described. 1...|$|R

40|$|The coastal {{fisheries}} in South Sulawesi are mostly composed by traditional fishing gears. Recently, {{most of the}} coastal fishermen in this area face hardly competition and conflict between small scale fisheries and big scale fisheries during fishing operation. In addition the local fishermen face some problems due to increase of fuel price and other operation cost, limited management capability, fisheries policy and development, and recently unpredictable weather. In order to reduce those problems, empowerment of the coastal fishing <b>community,</b> <b>subsidies</b> of the fuel price, and simplifies of fisheries policy and introducing of new fishing technology are become urgent actions to be taken. Transfer of eco-friendly fishing technology to the local fisheries community in Bone Bay, South Sulawesi as currently undertaken is one solution to overcome those problems.

This paper discusses on introduction of the set net fishing in South Sulawesi, with the activities such as site selection, preparation, capture process, and evaluation of the catch. It is expected that this paper could serve as useful reference {{for those who are}} interested on set net development strategy in coastal fisheries and fisheries management in coastal area in Indonesia or other region...|$|R
