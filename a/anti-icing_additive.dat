40|$|The {{biocidal}} and biostatic {{activities of}} seven glycol monoalkyl ether compounds were evaluated {{as part of}} an effort to find an improved <b>anti-icing</b> <b>additive</b> for jet aircraft fuel. Typical fuel contaminants, Cladosporium resinae, Gliomastix sp., Candida sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a mixed culture containing sulfate-reducing bacteria were used as assay organisms. Studies were carried out over 3 to 4 months in two-phase systems containing jet fuel and aqueous media. Diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, triethylene glycol monomethyl ether, triethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and 2 -methoxyethanol were generally biocidal in aqueous concentrations of 10 to 17 % for all organisms except Gliomastix, which required 25 % or more. 2 -Ethoxyethanol, 2 -propoxyethanol, and 2 -butoxyethanol were biocidal at progressively lower concentrations down to 1 to 2 % for 2 -butoxyethanol. The enhanced antimicrobial activity of these three compounds was attributed to cytoplasmic membrane damage because of the correlation between surface tension measurements and lytic activity with P. aeruginosa cells. The mechanism of action of the less active compounds appeared to be due to osmotic (dehydrating) effects. When all requirements are taken into account, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether appears to be the most promising replacement for the currently used additive, 2 -methoxyethanol...|$|E
40|$|Four, open-cell, ester-base {{polyurethane}} foams {{were examined}} for {{their effect on}} growth of fuel-utilizing organisms in jet fuel-water systems. Three foams contained a potential biocide, tetraethylthiuram E (0. 66 %), sodium omadine (0. 07 %), or zinc omadine (0. 07 %), all w/v. These were compared with a control foam which did not contain an additive. Each foam was examined in fuel-water systems containing JP- 4 fuel, JP- 4 fuel plus 0. 1 % <b>anti-icing</b> <b>additive</b> (AIA), or JP- 5 fuel. Pure cultures of a fuel-grown bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and of a fuel-grown fungus, Hormodendrum (Cladosporium) sp., served as test organisms. In control cultures without foam and in cultures containing control foam, P. aeruginosa achieved maximum stationary-phase populations of approximately 108 viable cells per ml, and Hormodendrum sp. produced an extensive mycelial mat. In the three fuel systems examined, tetraethylthiuram E- and sodium omadine-containing foams {{had little effect on}} growth of the bacterium; foam with zinc omadine decreased the rate of bacterial growth but had little effect on total populations. Tetraethylthiuram E decreased the rate of fungal growth and showed its greatest effect in JP- 4 plus AIA. Foam with sodium omadine or zinc omadine markedly decreased fungal growth in all three fuel systems. The data suggest that either sodium omadine or zinc omadine in polyurethane foam may be a useful antifungal agent; and that tetraethylthiuram E and AIA could exert a synergistic effect, particularly at AIA concentrations which have been reported to occur in some field situations...|$|E

It has been included in the digital archive for its historical value to NPS. Not believed to be a CIVINS (Civilian Institutions) title. The jet fuel currently used by the United States Air Force requires an <b>anti-icing</b> <b>additive</b> because of the long range, high altitude aircraft now in use. When transporting this jet fuel by tanker, all water must be removed from the vessel's tanks since the additive is highly soluble in water. In his three years experience as a petroleum inspector, the author has observed that tankers lifting JP 4 are delayed approximately 12 hours per cargo at a cost of approximately $ 2, 000 per cargo because of this tank drying requirement. Upon assignment to the University of Kansas in the Navy sponsored Petroleum Management Post Graduate Program, the author undertook, as his thesis project, the development of a less costly method of loading JP 4, basing his study primarily upon laboratory tests but realizing that actual field tests would be required for conclusive results. Laboratory tests conducted indicate that the icing inhibitor concentration in the fuel may be maintained within the military specification limits of 0. 10 - 0. 15 per cent as long as a sufficient quantity of inhibitor is injected to satisfy the equilibrium concentration requirement of the water remaining aboard the vessel after normal deb al lasting., In most cases, no more icing inhibitor is required than is called for by the maximum military specification limit. Tests conducted at the University of Kansas and the author's own experience in loading tankers indicate that extensive savings in tine and money may be realized by using the proposed method. Using the new method could result in a savings of approximately 12 hours turn-a-round time per cargo lifted, a savings which is of immediate significance to the military. By using the new method, a savings of approximately $ 2, 000 per cargo in drying time could also be realized, a savings of immediate significance to tanker operators. On a yearly basis, the author estimates that more than 4, 000 hours in tanker turn-a-round could be saved as well as $ 700, 000 in drying costs. Th-j author recommends, therefore, that field tests be conducted using actual vessels and that if these tests are successful the new method be adopted as soon as possible. [URL]...|$|E
