25|$|A group {{automorphism}} {{is a group}} isomorphism from a {{group to}} itself. Informally, it is <b>a</b> <b>permutation</b> <b>of</b> the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For every group G {{there is a natural}} group homomorphism G → Aut(G) whose image is the group Inn(G) of inner automorphisms and whose kernel is the center of G. Thus, if G has trivial center it can be embedded into its own automorphism group.|$|E
25|$|The longest strings in L {{are called}} basic words; each basic word forms <b>a</b> <b>permutation</b> <b>of</b> the whole alphabet. For instance, the basic {{words of a}} poset antimatroid are the linear {{extensions}} of the given partial order. If B is the set of basic words, L can be defined from B as the set of prefixes of words in B. It is often convenient to define antimatroids from basic words in this way, {{but it is not}} straightforward to write an axiomatic definition of antimatroids in terms of their basic words.|$|E

25|$|An {{aggregate}} may {{be divided}} into subsets, and {{all the members of}} the aggregate not part of any one subset are said to be its complement. A subset is self-complementing if it contains half of the set and its complement is also <b>a</b> <b>permutation</b> <b>of</b> the original subset. This is most commonly seen with hexachords or six-note segments from a basic tone row. A hexachord that is self-complementing for a particular permutation is referred to as prime combinatorial. A hexachord that is self-complementing for all of the canonic operations—Inversion, Retrograde and Retrograde Inversion—is referred to as all-combinatorial.|$|E
25|$|Australia and New Zealand use <b>a</b> <b>permutation</b> <b>of</b> the British system. Cup {{sizes are}} the same, but Australia's bra band {{measurement}} system {{is based on}} dress sizing charts. However, dress sizes and cuts are calculated for B and C cups only, so basing the choice of band size upon dress size is not an accurate {{way to get the}} bra size. Depending upon a person's build, a size 16 may wear a 16 C (UK 40 C), a 14 DD, 12 F or a 10 G (UK 34 G) underneath their clothes, because all bra sizes are made for the same chest circumference of approx. 40inches.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{the notion}} of {{permutation}} relates to the act of arranging {{all the members of}} a set into some sequence or order, or if the set is already ordered, rearranging (reordering) its elements, a process called permuting. These differ from combinations, which are selections of some members of a set where order is disregarded. For example, written as tuples, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). These are all the possible orderings of this three element set. As another example, an anagram of a word, all of whose letters are different, is <b>a</b> <b>permutation</b> <b>of</b> its letters. In this example, the letters are already ordered in the original word and the anagram is a reordering of the letters. The study of permutations of finite sets is a topic in the field of combinatorics.|$|E

500|$|A Sudoku grid is {{automorphic}} {{if it can}} {{be transformed}} in a way that leads back to the original grid, when that same transformation would not otherwise lead back to the original grid. [...] One example of a grid which is automorphic would be a grid which can be rotated 180 degrees resulting in a new grid where the new cell values are <b>a</b> <b>permutation</b> <b>of</b> the original grid. Automorphic Sudokus are Sudoku puzzles which solve to an automorphic grid. Two examples of automorphic Sudokus, and an automorphic grid are shown below.|$|E
500|$|The Galois {{group of}} a {{polynomial}} is {{the set of}} all transformations of the splitting field which preserve the ground field and {{the roots of the}} polynomial. (In mathematical jargon, these transformations are called automorphisms.) The Galois group of [...] consists of two elements: The identity transformation, which sends every complex number to itself, and complex conjugation, which sends i to −i. Since the Galois group does not change the ground field, it leaves the coefficients of the polynomial unchanged, so it must leave the set of all roots unchanged. Each root can move to another root, however, so transformation determines <b>a</b> <b>permutation</b> <b>of</b> the n roots among themselves. The significance of the Galois group derives from the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, which proves that the fields lying between the ground field and the splitting field are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of the Galois group.|$|E
