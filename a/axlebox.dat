5|$|Maintenance problems. The {{chain-driven}} {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} expensive to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the boiler lagging. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash, which provided combustible material, and sparks from heavy braking would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from <b>axlebox</b> lubricators onto the wheels when stationary, to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming {{into contact with the}} hot boiler causing stress to the casings. Many photographs show an un-rebuilt locomotive with warped casings, the result of a lagging fire.|$|E

25|$|In the preservation-era, steam {{locomotives}} {{had only}} recommenced departures from King's Cross in 1994, after a 30-year gap. The departure {{at the time}} was an Elizabethan train only as far as , hauled by No. 60009 Union of South Africa. In the following years, a goal of the preservation and railtour movement was to perform another all-steam-hauled train from London to Edinburgh. This was to have happened in 2008 as The Coronation, using two engines, one taking a London to York leg, and then another taking the train on to Edinburgh. The plan failed when, while stopped for water at Tyne Yard, an inspection of No. 60009 Union of South Africa revealed an over-heated <b>axlebox,</b> meaning the train was completed using diesel haulage. With the successful completion of the run by Tornado for Top Gear, she thus became the first steam engine to complete the run 'non-stop' for 41 years.|$|E

2500|$|With {{production}} reaching 151 {{there were}} some differences between batches of locos too. Ten of the initial twenty had [...] "Athermos" [...] pressure-lubricated plain bearing <b>axleboxes</b> rather than the more usual roller-bearing <b>axleboxes.</b> Although these remained {{for the life of}} the locos they were the only ones so fitted. Much more noticeable were D5114–D5132 which were fitted with tablet catchers on the side of the drivers cab for use on the Far North Line from Inverness. Also very visible were the roof-mounted headcode boxes fitted from D5114 giving an outward appearance very similar to the later Class 25 but without horn grilles.|$|R
2500|$|The {{design was}} based on a 4-4-0 design with a {{trailing}} axle added to support an enlarged coal bunker, a necessity for the intensive suburban services of the LSWR network. The radial <b>axlebox</b> worked in a corresponding curved hornblock the centre of which was struck near the middle of the chassis. The device was originally invented in 1863 by William Bridges Adams (no relation) and could be applied to a leading or trailing axle but was generally preferred for the latter. Many other engineers used it, including Webb, R. J. Billinton, H. G. Ivatt, and D.E. Marsh. Many of the tank engines so fitted earned the soubriquet [...] "Radial Tanks", or simply [...] "Radials".|$|E

50|$|It is {{emphasised}} {{that this}} is a much simplified description of the physics; complicating factors are creep, actual wheel and rail profiles, dynamic effects, stiffness of longitudinal restraint at <b>axleboxes,</b> and the lateral component of longitudinal (traction and braking) forces.|$|R
5000|$|After Grouping the LMS {{continued}} the Midland Railway's [...] "small engine policy" [...] of hauling trains using {{two or three}} locomotives of moderate power coupled together. This led {{to most of the}} Toton (Nottinghamshire)-Brent (London) coal trains being double-headed by 0-6-0 locomotives. It was realised that double heading was uneconomical so a Garratt locomotive was ordered from Beyer, Peacock and Company. However the LMS Derby design office insisted on the fitting of their standard <b>axleboxes</b> to the design. These <b>axleboxes</b> were barely adequate for the LMS Class 4F 0-6-0 locomotives, on which they frequently overheated, and were a major weakness on the LMS Garratts. They were also always heavy on coal and maintenance.|$|R
50|$|On 5 January 1892, a {{defective}} <b>axlebox</b> {{resulted in the}} derailment of part of a train shortly after it had departed Farringdon Street. Five passengers were injured.|$|E
50|$|Before {{leaving the}} SVR to resume its {{mainline}} appointments a broken tender <b>axlebox</b> {{was discovered that}} delayed its departure. Once repaired, a further delay was incurred by a defect in the air pump.|$|E
50|$|The C151A trains {{uses the}} monolink <b>axlebox</b> type bolsterless air spring bogie. There are no major {{technical}} differences between a trailer and motor car bogie other than additional electrical components for the latter.|$|E

50|$|The engine remains there, but {{the tender}} was {{scrapped}} {{to make more}} space for the shopping centre occupying that station building. The Bluebell Railway Atlantic Group purchased the <b>axleboxes,</b> springs and the complete wheel sets from the tender for use in their newbuild Atlantic project.|$|R

50|$|Each car {{is mounted}} on the {{bolsters}} of 2 double-sprung 2-axle trucks; the trucks of the power and trailer cars have significant differences. The power car trucks have <b>axlebox</b> guides which prevent any lateral or longitudinal movement of the axles relative to the truck frame. The truck frame's longitudinal beams are reinforced in the middle to take the car's weight via the bolster and suspension springs. The transverse beams have a complex shape to accommodate the traction motors (which are mounted entirely on the truck frame). The truck frame rests on the axleboxes via the <b>axlebox</b> suspension, which consists of 4 coil springs per <b>axlebox</b> (2 on each end of each axle). In turn, the truck frame bears {{the weight of the}} bolster via the double central suspension; the bolster bears the weight of the car directly. The truck frame is additionally reinforced at the attachment points for the suspension swing links. On early trains, the central suspension incorporated elliptical leaf springs, but from 1965 onward they were replaced with coil springs, which increased the maximum suspension travel from 95 to 120 mm (which reduced the risk of bottoming). Both stages of the suspension incorporate shock absorbers: the <b>axlebox</b> suspension has 2 friction shock absorbers per axle, and the central suspension has 5 hydraulic shock absorbers (on trucks with coil springs only). The car body rests on skid pads on the cast side flanges of the bolster; these skid pads are made of layered plastic, and serve to reduce the rolling and yawing movements of the trucks and car bodies. The car body is also connected {{to the center of the}} bolster by means of the central pivot—a vertical steel rod mounted in the center of the bolster, which transmits the traction and braking forces from the truck to the car body, and also receives part of the car body's weight.|$|E
5000|$|The design then {{underwent}} further improvement; {{the improved}} bogies {{used in the}} machines for Banverket were made standard with improvements to the <b>axlebox.</b> A 12-cylinder engine of [...] was used but from Caterpillar instead of the MTU engine used the machines built for Dortmunder Eisenbahn GmbH. With these changes the basic design of the main tranche of G 1206's was complete.|$|E
5000|$|Journal (friction, radial or rotary) bearing: This is {{the most}} common type of plain bearing; it is simply a shaft {{rotating}} in a bearing. [...] In locomotive and railroad car applications a journal bearing specifically referred to the plain bearing once used at the ends of the axles of railroad wheel sets, enclosed by journal boxes (axleboxes). <b>Axlebox</b> bearings today are no longer plain bearings but rather are rolling-element bearings.|$|E
50|$|In 1980, two wagons were {{modified}} {{for higher}} speed operation trials. GH155 and GH336 were fitted with new Gloucester Suspension Unit <b>axleboxes,</b> and trialled at speeds {{as high as}} 115 km/h. Given that no further wagons were fitted, {{it seems likely that}} the tests showed little to no benefit from faster running.|$|R
50|$|With {{the growth}} in freight a more {{powerful}} engine was required which resulted in this design by Sir Henry Fowler for an 0-6-0 tank locomotive with a 9 ft wheelbase which, aided {{by the use of}} Cartazzi self-centring <b>axleboxes</b> on the rear axle, allowed the loco to negotiate curves of 2½ chains.|$|R
25|$|The initial design also {{included}} a return to non-fluted coupling rods and laminated springs beneath the leading and driving <b>axleboxes</b> (both features harking back to the 1854 class). The locomotives were also fitted with cast iron chimneys (which had only rarely been fitted to earlier locomotives), and the whistles were fitted {{on top of the}} firebox rather than on top of the cab.|$|R
50|$|On {{the trailer}} cars, the trucks {{are similar to}} those of {{ordinary}} passenger cars, but have shorter frames. They lack <b>axlebox</b> guides (the longitudinal movements of the axles relative to the truck frame are limited solely by the suspension springs themselves), the springs are softer, the central pivot is made of 3 segments (which gives it a degree of flexibility), and the <b>axlebox</b> suspension friction shock absorbers are mounted inside the springs (on the power car trucks, they are mounted outside). The leading truck of the driving trailer has brackets for mounting the cab signal receiver coils. The early ER2 trailer cars had KVZ-5/E type trucks (identical to those on the ER1); later examples had the KVZ-TsNII/E type. The latter had the following design changes: the springs were softer; the bolster was attached to the frame by means of 2 swing links with rubber/metallic elements; the weight of the car body was borne by the bolster only via the skid pads (on the earlier type, part of the weight was also borne by the central pivot).|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of the roof section permitted a higher payload of grain, but between that {{and the weight of}} the roof, hopper sheets and hatch mechanisms, a GH wagon was significantly heavier than a standard tarped GY wagon. This led to problems with brakes, as the original braking systems for the lighter vehicles were retained. Further, wagons developed cracks in the frames not long after entering service, in the corners above the <b>axlebox</b> spring supports.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell plates}} of the boiler and firebox were of mild steel, the tubes were of brass and the firebox of copper. The grates {{were of the}} finger-bar rocking type. The bar frame was 4+1/2 in thick and was {{machined}} from solid mild steel slab. Steel castings were provided for the front buffer, knees at the motion plate, spring and compensating beam brackets, <b>axlebox</b> guides, wheel centres and eccentric sheaves. The cylinders were each cast in one piece {{with half of the}} boiler saddle.|$|E
50|$|In UIC {{notation}} this wheel arrangement {{could be}} described as a 2′C1′1′ (or more fully, 2′C1′1′h4vS) as the two trailing axles were independent, rather than a four-wheeled bogie as for those leading. The forward axle was {{similar to that of the}} pacifics, having outside frames and Cartazzi <b>axleboxes.</b> The rear axle was an inside-framed Bissel truck, pivoted ahead of the leading axle.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was able}} to negotiate curves with a radius of 275 ft, with 1/4 in gauge widening and 4+1/2 in superelevation. The wheels, axles and <b>axleboxes</b> of the leading bogie were designed to be interchangeable {{with those of the}} Class 15F, while the wheels and axles of the trailing bogie were interchangeable with those of the Class 24's trailing bogie.|$|R
50|$|The initial design also {{included}} a return to non-fluted coupling rods and laminated springs beneath the leading and driving <b>axleboxes</b> (both features harking back to the 1854 class). The locomotives were also fitted with cast iron chimneys (which had only rarely been fitted to earlier locomotives), and the whistles were fitted {{on top of the}} firebox rather than on top of the cab.|$|R
50|$|With America's {{entry to}} World War II, the USATC needed a {{developed}} design {{from which to}} create a volume of locomotive power for the wrecked railways of Europe, which they could use to deploy military hardware and civilian goods. Hence, the design created by Maj. J. W. Marsh from the Railway Branch of the Corps of Engineers, learnt from both previous locomotives, designed on austerity principles and built, using methods which created efficient and fast construction speed over long life, such as <b>axlebox</b> grease lubricators and rolled plates preferred to castings.|$|E
50|$|The {{accident}} enquiry, {{conducted by}} Lt Col G R S Wilson, found the track {{to be in}} good condition and the speed of the train not to be excessive. However this was the first trip out for the locomotive, No 46207 Princess Arthur of Connaught after its bogie wheelsets had been swapped round. The enquiry concluded that the derailment was caused by an excessively tight bogie <b>axlebox.</b> The approximate location of the collision was , less than a mile south-east of the 1915 derailment and close to the signal-box at Heyford south of Stowe Hill tunnel where the occupants were able to see the accident.|$|E
50|$|Stephenson's 'steam suspension' {{provided}} each {{wheel with}} its own 'steam spring'. Vertical cylinders were set into {{the base of the}} boiler, above each axle and offset in pairs to the sides. The chassis or frames of Stephenson's locomotives provided little structural strength, most of which came from the shell of the boiler. Inside each cylinder a piston carried the load of the axle and pressed upwards against steam pressure within the boiler. A piston of only a few inches in diameter was sufficient to balance the locomotive's weight. The <b>axlebox</b> bearings could slide vertically within hornblocks attached to the wooden frame beneath the boiler.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{successful}} use of modified N15 components to rebuild Nos.E448E457, the mechanically similar [...] "Scotch Arthurs" [...] proved disappointing when put into service from May 1925. The performance of those {{allocated to the}} Eastern section was indifferent, and failed to improve upon the double-headed ex-SECR 4-4-0s they were to replace. Reports of poor steaming and hot driving and tender wheel <b>axleboxes</b> were common from crewmen and shed fitters. After investigation, the problems were attributed to poor workmanship during construction as the North British Locomotive Company underquoted production costs to gain the contract. [...] Defects were found in boiler construction across the batch, and necessitated six replacement boilers, re-riveting, re-fitting of tubes and replacement of firebox stays. The hot driving wheel <b>axleboxes</b> were caused by the main frames being out of alignment. A 1926 report suggested that all affected locomotives {{should be taken to}} Eastleigh for repair. Once repaired, the [...] "Scotch Arthurs" [...] proved as capable {{as the rest of the}} class in service.|$|R
2500|$|European {{locomotives}} usually use [...] "plate frames", {{where two}} vertical flat plates form the main chassis, {{with a variety}} of spacers and a buffer beam at each end to keep them apart. When inside cylinders are mounted between the frames, the plate frames are a single large casting that forms a major support. The <b>axleboxes</b> slide up and down to give some sprung suspension, against thickened webs attached to the frame, called [...] "hornblocks".|$|R
50|$|The Silvertown {{lubricator}} {{was designed}} and developed by the Midland Railway in 1911 and from 1922 was commercially available from Gresham and Craven. This style of mechanical lubricator {{was used by the}} London, Midland and Scottish Railway and latter by British Rail, {{as well as by the}} various UK private locomotive builders for export overseas. Commonly 2 lubricators were fitted, one for lubricating the cylinders and the second for lubricating the <b>axleboxes.</b>|$|R
