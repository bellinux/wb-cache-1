5|$|Although {{little is}} known of Ordener's youth, {{he was the son}} of commoners and joined the legion of the Prince of Conde (cousin to the king) at the age of 18 (1776). He was {{assigned}} as a private of the Boufflers Dragoons, part of this legion. In 1783, he was appointed to the quartermaster corps and in 1787, he was promoted to warrant officer. In the early days of the French Revolution, he adopted its principles with zeal <b>and</b> <b>enthusiasm.</b>|$|E

5|$|He {{had been}} {{recommended}} {{to me as}} a man of energy <b>and</b> <b>enthusiasm,</b> but he seemed shy when we met. It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{resources}} not in short supply was petroleum oil; supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities. Considerable effort <b>and</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> was put into making use of petroleum products as a weapon of war.

Although limited in range, they were reasonably effective.|$|E
5|$|The {{price of}} {{collectible}} cars collapsed {{as a result}} of the recession over the six-year period from 1989–94; for example, a highly collectible Ferrari 250 GTO sold for just $3.5 million in 1994, an $11.1 million loss from its sale price in 1989. The Jaguar XJ220 had attracted a significant number of speculators who hoped the scarcity of the XJ220 <b>and</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for the Jaguar marque would push up prices overnight, allowing large profits to be made over a short period of time.|$|E

The band were impressed with his energy <b>and</b> <b>enthusiasm,</b> and offered him the job. Moon performed with the Beachcombers a few more times, but dates clashed and he chose to devote himself to the Who.

5|$|In 1923, Gellibrand {{founded the}} Remembrance Club in Hobart, {{with the aim}} of {{encouraging}} returned servicemen in business. Savige visited Gellibrand in Hobart during August 1923, and Gellibrand urged him to set up a similar club in Melbourne. Soon after Savige's return to Melbourne, a group of ex-servicemen met to say farewell to one of their number who was about to go to England. Savige used this opportunity to bring up the idea of a club similar to Gellibrand's Remembrance Club. After several informal meetings, the Melbourne club's inaugural meeting was held in Anzac House, Melbourne. Legacy Australia was founded as an ex-servicemen's club, but soon became a charitable organisation focusing on war widows and orphans. For the next 26years, due to his commitment, energy <b>and</b> <b>enthusiasm,</b> Savige's name became inseparable from both the club and the movement.|$|E
5|$|The main {{contractor}} was Hamilston's Windsor Ironworks Company Limited of Garston, Liverpool.

They were also responsible for another swing bridge on the North Docks Branch of the line close to the New Docks at Sharpness. The company manufactured the castings and the wrought iron structures for the bridge.

40|$|Aims: As an {{important}} intervening factor to enhance educational and motivational {{performance of the}} students, understating the effective factors on behavioral enthusiasm plays a very important role. The {{aim of this study}} was to explain the role of motivational self-regulation and procrastination in predicting the students’ behavioral enthusiasm.   Instrument & Methods: In the correlational descriptive cross-sectional study, 311 students of Arak University of Medical Sciences were selected via Available Sampling using Cochran’s Formula in 2014 - 15 academic year. Data was collected, using Students’ Educational Procrastination Scale, Motivational Self-regulating Scale, <b>and</b> Behavioral <b>Enthusiasm</b> Scale. Data was analyzed in SPSS 19 software using Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and Multiple Regression Analysis. Findings: The highest and the lowest correlations were between procrastination <b>and</b> behavioral <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>and</b> between environmental control <b>and</b> behavioral <b>enthusiasm,</b> respectively (p< 0. 05). There was a positive and significant correlation between self-regulation <b>and</b> behavioral <b>enthusiasm.</b> In addition, there was a negative and significant correlation between procrastination <b>and</b> behavioral <b>enthusiasm</b> (p< 0. 001). Totally, procrastination (β=- 0. 233) and motivational self-regulation (β= 0. 238) explained 10 % of the students’ behavioral enthusiasm variance (p< 0. 001; R&sup 2;= 0. 102). Conclusion: Any reduction in procrastination and any enhancement in motivational self-regulation can enhance the students’ behavioral enthusiasm.  ...|$|R

5|$|When {{production}} of Aspirin began in 1899, Bayer sent out small packets {{of the drug}} to doctors, pharmacists and hospitals, advising them of Aspirin's uses and encouraging them to publish about the drug's effects and effectiveness. As positive results came in <b>and</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> grew, Bayer sought to secure patent and trademark wherever possible. It was ineligible for patent in Germany (despite being accepted briefly before the decision was overturned), but Aspirin was patented in Britain (filed 22 December 1898) and the United States (US Patent 644,077 issued 27 February 1900). The British patent was overturned in 1905, the American patent was also besieged but was ultimately upheld.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{victory over}} Tripoli had very {{different}} {{consequences for the}} two nations involved. In Tripoli, the defeat, combined with severity of the Rous' punishment, severely hurt morale throughout the city, and led to significant reductions in recruitment for Tripolitan ships' crews. In the United States, the exact opposite occurred, with wild publicity surrounding the arrival of news that the Americans had won their first victory over the Tripolitans. The American government gave a month's pay as a bonus to each of Enterprise crew members, and honored Sterett by granting him a sword and calling for his promotion. Fanciful plays were written about the victorious Americans, and morale <b>and</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> about the war reached a high point. The victory {{did not have any}} long-term consequences in the conduct of the war, however. Dale's blockade of Tripoli was ineffective in preventing ships from entering and leaving the port, and was equally ineffective in altering the Pasha's diplomatic stance toward the Americans. Dale's squadron was relieved in 1802 by another under Richard Morris, and the war continued until 1805.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved on}} to Ipswich Town in 1969 {{and it was there}} that he {{established}} his reputation as a successful manager, supported by the club chairman John Cobbold and then later by his brother Patrick Cobbold. He won the vacant job at the Suffolk club after a chance encounter with Town director Murray Sangster while scouting at Portman Road for Chelsea manager Dave Sexton. After four mediocre seasons, Robson led Ipswich to fourth place in the First Division and success in the Texaco Cup in the 1972–73 season. In the following nine seasons, Ipswich finished lower than sixth place in the First Division only once, in the 1977–78 season. However, that season was a success with a 1–0 victory over Arsenal] in the FA Cup final. His reign at Ipswich lasted 13 years, during which time the club twice finished as League runners-up, and made regular appearances in European competitions, capturing the UEFA Cup in 1981 with a 5–4 aggregate victory over Dutch side AZ 67 Alkmaar. During his 13-year tenure, he brought in only 14 players from other clubs, most notably Allan Hunter, Bryan Hamilton and Paul Mariner, relying instead on players developed through Ipswich's youth programmes, including Terry Butcher, George Burley, John Wark, Mick Mills, Colin Viljoen, Alan Brazil, Trevor Whymark, Brian Talbot, Kevin Beattie and Eric Gates, who all went on to play international football. His imports included Dutch players Frans Thijssen and Arnold Mühren. Robson was not a tactical genius but he showed a talent for developing new players, with his good interpersonal skills, caring attitude, hard work <b>and</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> helping them to achieve their best.|$|E

5|$|In 1869, Grant {{proposed}} to annex the independent largely black nation of the Dominican Republic, {{then known as}} Santo Domingo. Previously in 1868, President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo, but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions {{for the protection of}} the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo and for the annexation of the Dominican Republic. In July, 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura Báez for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Samaná Bay for $2million. To keep the island nation and Báez secure in power, Grant ordered naval ships, unauthorized by Congress, to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection. Báez signed an annexation treaty on November 19, 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization. Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $1.5million to the Dominican national debt, the annexation of Santo Domingo as an American state, the United States' acquisition of the rights for Samaná Bay for 50 years with an annual $150,000 rental, and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention. On January 10, 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification. Despite his support of the annexation, Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance <b>and</b> <b>enthusiasm.</b>|$|E
5|$|The AESC {{continued}} to snub the government. Playford advocated {{the use of}} brown coal from the South Australian Leigh Creek mine to avoid supply complications, and even made into law a bill encouraging its use. He also championed {{the development of the}} town and the expansion of the mine, which had been dormant for several decades, to ease the state's dependency on imported coal. Much state and federal government money was invested in the scheme, the town infrastructure was built, and the production started in February 1944. Shortly afterwards, the AESC responded by buying new boilers which would only be able to the more productive black coal. With more conflicts ensuing, and even with the company slowly relenting, Playford did not stop his struggle. A Royal Commission in March 1945 was appointed to ascertain a solution between the two parties, and presented its report in August with a recommendation that the AESC be nationalised. A few months later, Playford's stance received a boost when heavy strikes in New South Wales forced shutdowns in South Australia that saw thousands of labourers out of work. By then {{at the head of the}} only conservative government in the nation, when Playford requested commonwealth funds to assist in the nationalisation of the AESC Prime Minister Chifley responded with glee <b>and</b> <b>enthusiasm.</b> On 11 October, he presented a bill to Parliament to nationalise the AESC and create the Electricity Trust of South Australia.|$|E
5|$|The Ramblin' Wreck, {{the iconic}} 1930 Ford Model A Sport coupe {{that serves as}} the {{official}} mascot of the student body, was acquired in this era. The Wreck is present at all major sporting events and student body functions, and leads the football team into Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, a duty it has performed since 1961. Dean of Student Affairs Jim Dull recognized a need for an official Ramblin' Wreck when he observed the student body's fascination with classic cars. Fraternities, in particular, would parade around their House Wrecks as displays of school spirit <b>and</b> <b>enthusiasm.</b> It was considered a rite of passage to own a broken-down vehicle. In 1960, Dull began a search for a new official symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search employed newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate this vehicle. The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960 when Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot. When Johnson returned to his car, he found a note from Dull attached to his windshield. Dull's note offered to purchase the car to serve as Georgia Tech's official mascot. Johnson, after great deliberation, agreed to take $1,000; he eventually returned the money in 1984 so that the car would be remembered as an official donation to Georgia Tech and the Alexander-Tharpe Fund. The Ramblin' Wreck was officially transferred to the Athletic Association on May 26, 1961.|$|E

5|$|The debacle in Russia {{loosened}} the French {{grip on the}} German princes. In 1813, Napoleon {{mounted a}} campaign in the German states {{to bring them back}} into the French orbit; the subsequent War of Liberation culminated in the great Battle of Leipzig, also known as the Battle of Nations. In October 1813, more than 500,000 combatants engaged in ferocious fighting over three days, making it the largest European land battle of the 19th century. The engagement resulted in a decisive victory for the Coalition of Austria, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden, and it ended French power east of the Rhine. Success encouraged the Coalition forces to pursue Napoleon across the Rhine; his army and his government collapsed, and the victorious Coalition incarcerated Napoleon on Elba. During the brief Napoleonic restoration known as the 100 Days of 1815, forces of the Seventh Coalition, including an Anglo-Allied army under the command of the Duke of Wellington and a Prussian army under the command of Gebhard von Blücher, were victorious at Waterloo (18 June 1815). The critical role played by Blücher's troops, especially after having to retreat from the field at Ligny the day before, helped to turn the tide of combat against the French. The Prussian cavalry pursued the defeated French in the evening of 18 June, sealing the allied victory. From the German perspective, the actions of Blücher's troops at Waterloo, and the combined efforts at Leipzig, offered a rallying point of pride <b>and</b> <b>enthusiasm.</b> This interpretation became a key building block of the Borussian myth expounded by the pro-Prussian nationalist historians later in the 19th century.|$|E
