The emergence of such organizations can be regarded as the beginning of a meshing together of civilizations through the identification of common problems and challenges, a slow process dominating much of the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|International {{organizations}} such as WHO and the World Bank, institutions in several developed countries such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <b>and</b> <b>Nongovernmental</b> Organizations (NGOs) will continue {{to play an important}} role in strengthening both international and national surveillance and response systems for infectious diseases. Development of an integrated global surveillance and response system probably is at least a decade or more away. This owes to the magnitude of the challenge; inadequate coordination at the international level; and lack of funds, capacity, and, in some cases, cooperation and commitment at the national level. Some countries hide or understate their infectious disease problems for reasons of prestige and fear of economic losses. Total international health-related aid to low- and middle-income countries—some $2–3 billion annually—remains a fraction of the $250 billion health bill of these countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} prohibits any {{publications that}} it feels will incite racial or religious disharmony, and has asked that religious matters not {{be discussed in}} public due to their sensitivity. It claims nobody has been arrested under the Internal Security Act for religious reasons. The government may demolish unregistered religious places of worship, <b>and</b> <b>nongovernmental</b> organisations have complained about the demolition of unregistered Hindu temples. These were often constructed on privately owned plantations prior to independence in 1957. After independence plantations became government property. In 2006 the state of Negeri Sembilan announced the demolition of a Hindu temple, although the temple sought injunction {{and took it to}} court. State governments control mosques, appoint imams, and provide guidance for sermon content. The conflict between the federal and state governments over religious authority led to a slow pace of reform and development of laws relating to Islam. Other religious groups, such as the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism (MCCBCHST), have supported political rallies.|$|E
