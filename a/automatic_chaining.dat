50|$|Three {{types of}} autocannons are {{available}} for Z-10, with the first being a 23 mm <b>automatic</b> <b>chain</b> gun indigenously developed by China. The largest caliber of gun carried by Z-10 is a 30 mm automatic gun, a Chinese development of the Russian 2A72 autocannon for aircraft use. One of the primary reasons to adopt the 2A72 30 mm gun for aerial use is its high reliability, and according to Russian claim, the failure rate of 2A72 is nearly zero. Another important reason for developing an aerial version of the 2A72 30 mm gun is to simplify logistics. Older 30 mm guns used on fighter jets such as Shenyang J-6 are not compatible with ground and naval guns of the same caliber, and using the same ammo for air, ground and naval guns with the same caliber would greatly reduce the operational cost.|$|R
40|$|The IST project Cuidado, {{which started}} in January 2001, aims at {{producing}} the first entirely <b>automatic</b> <b>chain</b> for extracting and exploiting musical metadata for browsing music. The Sony CSL laboratory is primarily interested {{in the context of}} popular music browsing in large-scale catalogues. First, we are interested in human-centred issues related to browsing "Popular Music". Popular here means that the music accessed to is widely distributed, and known to many listeners. Second, we consider "popular browsing" of music, i. e. making music accessible to non specialists (music lovers), and allowing sharing of musical tastes and information within communities, departing from the usual, single user view of digital libraries. This research project covers all areas of the music-to-listener chain, from music description - descriptor extraction from the music signal, or data mining techniques -, similarity based access and novel music retrieval methods such as automatic sequence generation, and user interface issues.

40|$|Molecular {{replacement}} 1, 2, 3, 4 procedures, which {{search for}} placements of a starting model within the crystallographic unit cell that best {{account for the}} measured diffraction amplitudes, followed by <b>automatic</b> <b>chain</b> tracing methods 5, 6, 7, 8, have allowed the rapid solution {{of large numbers of}} protein crystal structures. Despite extensive work 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, molecular replacement or the subsequent rebuilding usually fail with more divergent starting models based on remote homologues with less than 30 % sequence identity. Here we show that this limitation can be substantially reduced by combining algorithms for protein structure modelling with those developed for crystallographic structure determination. An approach integrating Rosetta structure modelling with Autobuild chain tracing yielded high-resolution structures for 8 of 13 X-ray diffraction data sets that could not be solved in the laboratories of expert crystallographers and that remained unsolved after application of an extensive array of alternative approaches. We estimate that the new method should allow rapid structure determination without experimental phase information for over half the cases where current methods fail, given diffraction data sets of better than 3. 2 [*]Å resolution, four or fewer copies in the asymmetric unit, and the availability of structures of homologous proteins with > 20 % sequence identity...|$|R

These motorcycles were painted in the colour combinations black/blue metallic, black/red metallic and black/silver grey and were mainly marketed in Italy, France, and Australia.

Fiscal Year 2016 funding budgets for 804 JLTVs. The Army received its first seven JLTVs for test {{at the end of}} September 2016 according to Colonel Shane Fullmer, JLTV project manager stated at an AUSA 2016 media briefing. He said test vehicles would be sent to Yuma, Arizona, for automotive and mobility testing; to Ft Huachuca, Arizona, for cyber, electronic warfare, and C4 testing; Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, for reliability and automotive testing; and to Alaska for automotive and environmental testing. Some JLTV testing was deferred during the EMD phase, as the government did not want to pay for testing with three suppliers, and it is now set for testing with a fleet of 100 JLTVs. By April 2017 30 JLTVs had been delivered, testing expected to continue through the first quarter of FY19. Also at an AUSA 2016 media briefing, Scott Davis, program executive officer for Combat Support & Combat Service Support, stated that Overall the JLTV programme expects to cut about five years off of the total program and save about US$5.9 billion, as Oshkosh's final competitive bid was low enough so the army decided to 'buy to budget' and get more platforms each year, which shrunk the total length of the contract and increased cost avoidances accrued each year. At AUSA 2016, Oshkosh displayed a JLTV General Purpose variant equipped with an EOS R-400S-MK2 remote weapon system integrated with Orbital ATK's M230 LF 30mm lightweight <b>automatic</b> <b>chain</b> gun.|$|R

40|$|To ensure {{health and}} hearing comfort, {{acoustics}} {{becomes more and}} more essential in the design of fans. 3 D numerical calculations (mechanical, aerodynamic and magnetic) are used to ensure the compliance of fans before production test prototypes. However, numerical modelling is long and costly to the company; the use of analytical software calculations is an alternative for designers. An analytical chain allows less precise but way faster calculations enabling to link earlier in the design, the aerodynamic, mechanical and magnetic with the acoustic part. The master thesis is split in two steps. First, the reliability between the aerodynamic and the acoustic data is enhanced for a better estimation of the aerodynamic noise. This is done by using an extraction tool of the aerodynamic and geometric data, inputs of an analytical software OPTIBRUI that estimates the aeroacoustic noise. An <b>automatic</b> <b>chain</b> on a set of Technofan fans is also used in order to validate and optimize the OPTIBRUI configuration in relation to test measurements. In addition to this analytical chain, links between CFD data and measurements have been created. These links are used to compare the data from analytical and numerical calculations with the measurements in order to establish the suitability of the results. The results obtained are very encouraging as they predict the noise level within 3 dB. The master thesis ends with the dissociation of the three noise sources occurring in fans (aerodynamic, mechanical and magnetic) knowing the characteristic frequencies of the mechanical and magnetic noise mechanisms. With this dissociation, it is possible to know rapidly from measurements the parts of the fan that are noise dominant and to guide the working times on the jobs treating the zones where the noise is predominant (aerodynamic engineer, electric motor engineer or mechanical engineer) ...|$|R
