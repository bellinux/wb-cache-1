25|$|The {{decision}} {{to adopt the}} Pentropic organisation was driven {{by a desire to}} modernise the Army and ensure that Australian units were able to integrate with those of the United States Army. While the US Pentomic organisation had been implemented in 1957 to improve the Army's ability to operate during a nuclear war, the Australian organisation was optimised for limited wars in South East Asia in which there was a chance that nuclear weapons might be used. Both structures were designed to facilitate independent operations by the sub-units of divisions. The Australian Pentropic division was intended to be <b>air</b> <b>portable,</b> capable of fighting in a limited war and capable of conducting anti-guerrilla operations.|$|E

It was found that highefficiency particulate air (HEPA) and electrostatic precipitator (ESP) PACs have the best performance in terms of UFP removal rate, with an electret-based PAC also showing comparably high removal rates. Using modeling based on the experimental findings, some PAC technologies were shown to be effective in reducing indoor UFP concentrations in a typical Quebec City residential room by a factor of about 90...|$|R
