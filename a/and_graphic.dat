40|$|A novel text {{extraction}} method from graphical document images {{is presented in}} this paper. Graphical document images containing text <b>and</b> <b>graphics</b> components are considered as two-dimensional signals by which text <b>and</b> <b>graphics</b> have different morphological characteristics. The proposed algorithm relies upon a sparse representation framework with two appropriately chosen discriminative overcomplete dictionaries, each one gives sparse representation over one type of signal and non-sparse representation over the other. Separation of text <b>and</b> <b>graphics</b> components is obtained by promoting sparse representation of input images in these two dictionaries. Some heuristic rules are used for grouping text components into text strings in post-processing steps. The proposed method overcomes the problem of touching between text <b>and</b> <b>graphics.</b> Preliminary experiments show some promising results on different types of document...|$|R

5|$|Deodato drew {{influence}} from {{the works of}} Paolo Cavara, Gualtiero Jacopetti, and Franco Prosperi, documentary filmmakers of whom Deodato was a fan. Prosperi and Jacopetti produced several Mondo films, which are documentaries {{similar to the one}} made in Cannibal Holocaust. These documentaries focused on sensationalistic <b>and</b> <b>graphic</b> content from around the world, including bizarre local customs, death, and general cruelty. Deodato followed suit in ways of similar content, such as graphic violence and animal slayings. Although fictional, Deodato created a similar exposé of worldly violence, such as Cavara's, Prosperi's and Jacopetti's Mondo Cane.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights of the Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried {{to learn as much}} about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, <b>and</b> <b>graphic</b> novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized {{one of the things that}} made Knights of the Old Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E
5|$|Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was {{developed}} for the PlayStation 3. The team planned to bring the game to the console {{from the beginning of}} development, but opted to work on the DS version of the game beforehand due to the larger number of DS users in Japan at the time. The team found the PlayStation 3 allowed them to render the game world with great detail, using the hardware to its full potential to present the animation, world and music. Hino felt that the PlayStation 3 version allowed the game's music to accompany the imagery, which was not possible on the DS version. The team found particular technical difficulty in animating Oliver's cape, which was overcome by a combination of mathematical calculations and hand-drawn motions by the programmers <b>and</b> <b>graphic</b> artists, respectively.|$|E
