25|$|A verse {{narrative}}, <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect,</b> {{is simply}} a narrative poem, a poem that tells a story. What is interesting about this subgenre is that owing to {{its place in the}} flexible category of long poem, the verse-narrative may have disrupted convention by telling its story in both poem and narrative. This combination broadens the scope of both genres, lending the poem's depth that may be lacking in the other subgenres, yet also a lyrical voice that defines it as poetry. For an example of this, one might turn to Gilgamesh, which encompasses both the subgenres Epic and Verse-Narrative.|$|E

25|$|MIL-101, a large-cavity MOF {{having the}} formula , is a cyanosilylation catalyst. The coordinated water {{molecules}} in MIL-101 are easily removed to expose Cr(III) sites. <b>As</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect,</b> given the greater Lewis acidity of Cr(III) vs. Cu(II), MIL-101 {{is much more}} active than HKUST-1 {{as a catalyst for}} the cyanosilylation of aldehydes. Additionally, the Kaskel group observed that the catalytic sites of MIL-101, in contrast to those of HKUST-1, are immune to unwanted reduction by benzaldehyde. The Lewis-acid-catalyzed cyanosilylation of aromatic aldehydes has also been carried out by Long and co-workers using a MOF of the formula Mn3. This material contains a three-dimensional pore structure, with the pore diameter equaling 10 Å. In principle, either of the two types of Mn(II) sites could function as a catalyst. Noteworthy features of this catalyst are high conversion yields (for small substrates) and good substrate-size-selectivity, consistent with channellocalized catalysis.|$|E

25|$|Many fields {{around the}} village reflect England's history. The field known as 'the Leys' (opposite Milton House in Rectory Lane) shows clear signs of 18th-century pre-enclosure and pre-British Agricultural Revolution farming in strips {{although}} this is slowly disappearing with recent farming. The mediaeval open field system was enclosed in Milton in 1779 together with that of Collingtree. The soil is predominantly sandy <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> since the area is the bed of an ancient river. Evidence of sand and clay extraction is all around, reflecting 19th- and 20th-century industrial and urban expansion. For example, the small industrial estate in Gayton Road is on an old clay quarry; the playing and football fields in Collingtree Road are on the sites of sand quarries - {{in the latter case}} mostly filled with clay spoil from the 1950s construction of the M1. The field between Towcester Road and the A43 Milton by-pass, which opened in May 1991, {{to the west of the}} village was also the site of a sand quarry in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

[...] Ned Raggett, also of AllMusic, noted that [...] "there's nothing quite so stunning as [...] magnificent remake of Bad Brains' 'The Big Takeover'." [...] Adam Williams of PopMatters said the album [...] "fall somewhere between madness and brilliance".

500|$|Postbellum {{criticism}} of Longstreet {{claims that he}} was ordered by Lee to attack {{in the early morning}} and that his delays were a significant contributor to the loss of the battle. However, Lee agreed to the delays for arriving troops and did not issue his formal order for the attack until 11 a.m. Although Longstreet's motivations have long been clouded by the vitriol of the Lost Cause partisans (see Legacy), many historians agree that Longstreet did not aggressively pursue Lee's orders to launch an attack as early as possible. Biographer Jeffry D. Wert wrote, [...] "Longstreet deserves censure for his performance on the morning of July 2. He allowed his disagreement with Lee's decision to affect his conduct. Once the commanding general determined to assail the enemy, duty required Longstreet to comply with the vigor and thoroughness that had previously characterized his generalship. The concern for detail, the regard for timely information, and the need for preparation were absent." [...] Military historians Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones wrote, [...] "Unenthusiastic about the attack, Longstreet consumed so much time in properly assembling and aligning the corps that the assault did not commence until 4 p.m. During all the time that passed, Meade continued to move in troops to bring about a more and more complete concentration; by 6 p.m. he had achieved numerical superiority and had his left well covered." [...] Campaign historian Edwin Coddington presents a lengthy description of the approach march, which he described as [...] "a comedy of errors such <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> of inexperienced commanders and raw militia, but not of Lee's [...] "War Horse" [...] and his veteran troops." [...] He called the episode [...] "a dark moment in Longstreet's career as a general." [...] Gettysburg historian Harry Pfanz concluded that [...] "Longstreet's angry dissidence had resulted in further wasted time and delay." [...] David L. Callihan, in a 2002 reassessment of Longstreet's legacy, wrote, [...] "It is appalling that a field commander of Longstreet's experience and caliber would so cavalierly and ineptly march and prepare his men for battle." ...|$|E
