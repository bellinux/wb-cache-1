Peter is shocked but excited to discover that Lois was bisexual in college. Naomi indicates that she would like to discuss an important matter with them at their home. Assuming that he will participate in a threesome with Lois and Naomi, Peter sends Chris, Meg, Stewie, and Brian out of the house. After Naomi arrives, she introduces her husband Dale. Peter expects that they will now be participating in <b>an</b> <b>orgy,</b> and tries to seduce the three of them while dressed in various costumes.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1570, the Turks struck again, but {{this time with a}} {{full-scale}} invasion rather than a raid.

In <b>an</b> <b>orgy</b> of victory on the day that the city fell—September 9, every public building and palace was looted.

25|$|According to Liu Xiang’s book Lienü zhuan written much later, around 18 BCE, Jie was {{corrupted}} by his infatuation with his concubine Mo Xi (妺喜 or 末喜), who was beautiful, but completely lacking in virtue.

They both sailed about in the alcohol lake in <b>an</b> <b>orgy</b> of drunken naked men and women bathing and drinking. She then commanded 3,000 men to drink the lake dry, only to laugh when they all drowned. This event was also recorded in the Han Ying’s book Han shi waizhuan.|$|E
25|$|According to {{researcher}} and author Krisztián Ungváry, some 38,000 {{civilians were killed}} during the Siege of Budapest: about 13,000 from military action and 25,000 from starvation, disease and other causes. Included in the latter figure are about 15,000 Jews, largely victims of executions by Hungarian Arrow Cross Party militia. When the Soviets finally claimed victory, they initiated <b>an</b> <b>orgy</b> of violence, including the wholesale theft of anything they could lay their hands on, random executions and mass rape. An estimated 50,000 women and girls were raped, although estimates vary from 5,000 to 200,000.

25|$|The {{spread of}} {{prostitution}} practices {{has introduced a}} large quantity of slang to the popular vocabulary. Prostitution is a popular subject in the media, especially on the internet. Typically news of police raids, court cases or family tragedies related to prostitution are published in a sensationalised form. A good example is news of <b>an</b> <b>orgy</b> between 400 Japanese clients and 500 Chinese prostitutes in 2003, which partially because of anti-Japanese sentiment, was widely publicised and met with considerable outrage. Another highly publicised case was that of Alex Ho Wai-to, then a Democratic Party candidate for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, who was given a six-month re-education through labor sentence for hiring a prostitute.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo speed {{across the}} Nevada desert. Duke, under the {{influence}} of mescaline, complains of a swarm of giant bats, before going through the pair's inventory of psychoactive drugs. Shortly afterward, the duo stop to pick up a young hitchhiker, and explain what they are doing. Duke has been assigned by an unnamed magazine to travel to Las Vegas and cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race. However, they have also decided {{to take advantage of the}} trip by purchasing a large number of drugs, and rent a red Chevrolet Impala convertible. The young man soon becomes terrified of the antics of the duo, and flees on foot. Trying to reach Vegas before the hitchhiker can go to the police, Gonzo gives Duke part of a sheet of Sunshine Acid, then informs him that there is little chance of making it before the drug kicks in. By the time they reach the strip, Duke is in the full throes of his trip, and barely makes it through the check-in, all the while hallucinating that the hotel clerk is a moray eel, and that his fellow bar patrons are lizards in the depths of <b>an</b> <b>orgy.</b>|$|E

500|$|Despite these strengths, the castles {{and town}} walls are now {{recognised}} to {{have also had}} military flaws. The castles were much larger than {{they needed to be}} in order to protect against Welsh attack, but the sheer scale of them meant that the Crown could not afford to maintain or garrison them properly. The fortifications were in some regards simply too big, and as historian Michael Prestwich notes, smaller projects might actually have been more effective. Rather than the sites being scientifically designed, historian Richard Morris suggested that [...] "the impression is firmly given of an elite group of men-of-war, long-standing comrades in arms of the king, indulging in <b>an</b> <b>orgy</b> of military architectural expression on an almost unlimited budget".|$|E
