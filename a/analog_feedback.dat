While most of the previous works have considered perfect feedback channels, in this paper, we evaluate {{the impact of a}} noisy feedback channel on the quality and the performance of the transmission. We compare the finite rate feedback scheme with the <b>analog</b> <b>feedback</b> schemes where the channel parameters are transmitted without quantization over the uplink channel. Two <b>analog</b> <b>feedback</b> schemes are considered: the feedback of the channel vector and the feedback of the normalized channel vector. We provide bounds on the performance and give numerical results. We have shown that at low to medium uplink SNR the <b>analog</b> <b>feedback</b> of the normalized channel vector outperforms the <b>analog</b> <b>feedback</b> of the channel vector.

40|$|Interference {{alignment}} (IA) is a multiplexing gain optimal transmission {{strategy for}} the interference channel. While the achieved sum rate with IA {{is much higher than}} previously thought possible, the improvement often comes at the cost of requiring network channel state information at the transmitters. This can be achieved by explicit feedback, a flexible yet potentially costly approach that incurs large overhead. In this paper we propose <b>analog</b> <b>feedback</b> as an alternative to limited feedback or reciprocity based alignment. We show that the full multiplexing gain observed with perfect channel knowledge is preserved by <b>analog</b> <b>feedback</b> and that the mean loss in sum rate is bounded by a constant when signal-to-noise ratio is comparable in both forward and feedback channels. When signal-to-noise ratios are not quite symmetric, a fraction of the multiplexing gain is achieved. We consider the overhead of training and feedback and use this framework to optimize the system's effective throughput. We present simulation results to demonstrate the performance of IA with <b>analog</b> <b>feedback,</b> verify our theoretical analysis, and extend our conclusions on optimal training and feedback length.

The DPAP was constructed by attaching an aluminum cone loudspeaker {{at each end of}} a short segment of a circular duct. Two <b>analog</b> <b>feedback</b> controllers were designed and built using the measured frequency response function of each panel. Two independent (decoupled) feedback controllers were then used to minimize the vibration amplitude of each panel in the presence of an acoustic disturbance. A normal-incidence transmission loss measurement system was used to assess the performance of the DPAP and of a single panel passive partition. Error signal attenuations show that it is both feasible and effective to simultaneously control both panels with decoupled feedback controllers, and that simultaneously controlling both panels of the DPAP has a distinct advantage over controlling a single panel. The reduction in vibration amplitude {{across the surface of the}} transmitting panel was confirmed with scanning laser vibrometer measurements. Transmission loss results were obtained for two passive and three active configurations. The average normal incidence transmission loss over the active measurement bandwidth (50 - 1, 000 Hz) for the active double panel was 60 dB.

40|$|Delta-Sigma {{modulator}} ADCs {{are used}} extensively in applications where the analog signal bandwidth is narrow compared to practical ADC sample-rates because these ADCs are very efficient and the oversampling relaxes the analog filtering requirements prior to digitization. Conventional continuous-time delta-sigma modulator ADCs require high accuracy building block including low-leakage <b>analog</b> integrators, high-linearity <b>feedback</b> DACs, high-accuracy reference voltages, high-speed comparators, and low jitter clocks. Unfortunately, as process technologies scale and supply voltages are reduced it becomes {{increasingly difficult to}} build these circuits. Fortunately however, highly scaled CMOS processes offer very fast, very dense and very low-power digital logic gates. This dissertation presents continuous-time delta-sigma modulator ADCs that consist mostly of digital logic gates.
