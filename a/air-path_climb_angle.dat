40|$|Availability of the <b>climbing</b> <b>angle</b> {{information}} {{is crucial for}} the intelligent vehicle system. However, the <b>climbing</b> <b>angle</b> information can’t be measured with the sensor mounted on the vehicle. In this paper, <b>climbing</b> <b>angle</b> estimation system is proposed. First, longitudinal acceleration obtained from gyro-sensor is compared with the actual longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle. If the vehicle is in yawing motion, actual longitudinal acceleration can’t be approximated from time derivative of wheel speed, because lateral velocity and yaw rate affect actual longitudinal acceleration. Wheel speed and yaw rate {{can be obtained from}} the sensors mounted on the vehicle, but lateral velocity can’t be measured from the sensor. Therefore, lateral velocity is estimated using unknown input observer with nonlinear tire model. Simulation results show that the compensated results using lateral velocity and yaw rate show better performance than uncompensated results. ? ??? ?????? ???? ????????????? ????? 2008 ?? ????????????(07 ????A 01) ? ???? ?????. ? ??? 2012 ?? ??(???????) ? ??????????? ??? ?? ??? ???????

The vehicle control and navigation technique is implemented using a two-mode controller consisting of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and fuzzy logic control.

The SANS is designed to determine the location of an underwater object {{using a combination of}} Global Positioning System (GPS) while surfaced, sand Inertial Navigation System (INS) while submerged. Various experimental testing of the hardware was performed to determine the ability of the GPS navigation system to function within the mission requirements.

A test of the system while the antenna was covered with water, was done to determine if the GPS signal could penetrate a shallow while the antenna was covered with water, was done to determine if the GPS signal could penetrate a shallow layer of water. Finally, a sea test was done to determine the feasibility of reacquiring a GPS fix after the system has been submerged during normal ocean wave wash. A computer simulation was written in Common LISP Object System (CLOS) in order to evaluate the errors introduced by using a accelerometer in the INS to determine the <b>climb</b> <b>angle</b> of the AUV while surfacing.
