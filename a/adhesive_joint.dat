40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> between a work-piece and grippers provides {{an effective means}} of stiffening compliant work-piece regions. However if the grippers are anchored in the fixture, the residual stresses that result from adhesive shrinkage can significantly distort the work-piece regions they are intended to support. This research shows that distortion is heavily influenced by curing regimen. When <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> are cured sequentially, the order in which <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> are cured can be manipulated to minimize the distortion at various regions as well as minimize the maximum distortion for the overall region. Curing order also heavily influences the residual forces in the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> while simultaneously not affecting system compliance. Curing the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> simultaneously neither leads to the maximum distortion for a system nor the minimum...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{strength}} and failure prediction {{as well as}} reliability issues of <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> of brittle epoxy bonding of two dissimilar adherends. Effects of bond thickness and scarf angle upon the strength of such joints are also addressed. Three kinds of <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints,</b> i. e., butt, scarf and shear joints, are considered. It is found that the strength prediction of various <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> under consideration {{can be done by}} establishing interface corner toughness, Hc, parameter. For <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> with an interfacial crack, fracture toughness, Jc, or interfacial toughness, Kc, {{can be used as a}} fracture criterion depending on the fracture type observed. The predicted strengths based on these fracture criteria (i. e., Hc, Jc and Kc) are in good agreement with experimental data obtained. Weibull modulus is a suitable parameter to define the strength reliability of <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints.</b> From experimental data, scarf joint of 45 ° is identified to be preferable since it satisfies both outstanding load-bearing performance and tolerable reliability. In addition, the Weibull statistical method has made possible the strength reliability determination of non-cracked <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractStructural <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> are {{adequate}} for joining aluminum with composite material (automotive, aeronautic, etc.).

Low-pressure is created in the volume by a pipeline of the testing device, and a gas flow discharged by the pipeline from the volume during the maintenance of low pressure is measured. The testing of the joint is implemented after producing the joint or before hardening the joint, and force acting against the joint is exerted on a plate (3) and a frame (1) during the testing of quality of the joint. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a device for testing quality of an <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> between a plate and a frame. USE - Used for testing quality of an <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> between a plate and a frame in an industrial application. ADVANTAGE - The testing of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> is implemented after producing the joint or before hardening the joint, thus improving adhering pattern based on the force exerted by the lower pressure at the plate and the frame as contact surface of the plate and the frame is increased.

40|$|A {{cartonboard}} {{package is}} often sealed and closed with an adhesive – either a hot-melt adhesive (adhesives that are applied in a molten {{state on the}} cartonboard) or a dispersion adhesive (adhesives that are applied as water-based dispersions). This thesis focuses {{on the process of}} hot-melt gluing, and how material properties and process conditions affect the performance of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint.</b> Requirements vary depending on how the package is to be used. A package that is only supposed to protect the product during transport differs from one that is supposed to attract consumers and facilitate their use of the product. If a package has been opened, due to external or internal forces that cause a fracture in the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint,</b> the consumer may choose another package instead. A fracture of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> may occur in several different ways; for example, a cohesive fracture in the adhesive, an interfacial fracture between the adhesive and one of the cartonboard surfaces, and a cohesive fracture in the cartonboard. The traditional way of testing the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> is to subjectively evaluate the fibre tear after manually tearing the joint apart. The primary interest of this study has been to find an objective method that can characterise the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> – that is, its strength and joint characteristics. The work has principally concentrated on physical experiments where the Y-peel method has been evaluated and further developed, including the construction of a laboratory adhesive applicator. <b>Adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> failure is analysed and correlated to the force-elongation curve during Y-peel testing in order to explore various mechanisms of the failure. The force versus elongation curves are transformed into a force versus inelastic deformation curve for the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint.</b> The inelastic deformation of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> is defined as the inelastic opening of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> perpendicular to the cartonboard surface. The dissipative descending energy has been used to characterise the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint.</b> High descending dissipative energy showed high resistance against final failure of the joint. This correlates very well with the manual fibre-tear test. Characteristic force-elongation curves in Y-peel testing – that is, the shape of the curve – have been analysed, and four main failure modes have been identified. The finite element method has been used to predict mechanical behaviour in the ascending part of the force-elongation curve. When it comes to local behaviour, a high stiffness adhesive results in bending behaviour while a low results in shearing, but on a global scale, no big difference was detected on the ascending part of the force-elongation curve. The new laboratory adhesive applicator and finite element method can be used to objectively design the interaction between the adhesive and the cartonboard for a specific application. This can be achieved by modifying the cartonboard, the adhesive or the process parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} electrically conductive <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> exposed to elevated temperature and relative humidity conditions has been investigated, and failure mechanisms of conductive <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> have been determined. Three model, silver-filled, epoxy-based adhesive {{systems have been}} studied in conjunction with printed circuit board (PCB) substrates with metallizations of Au/Ni/Cu and Cu. Double cantilever beam (DCB) tests have been adopted to investigate the effects of environmental aging on electrically conductive <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints.</b> This study reveals that conductive adhesives as well as substrate metallizations both play important roles in the durability of conductive <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints.</b> The rate of water attack on the interface of conductive <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> with Cu plated PCB substrates is faster than for those with Au/Ni/Cu metallization. A possible explanation of this phenomenon is based on considerations of surface free energy and interfacial free energy. Following drying of the aged conductive <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints,</b> the fracture energy recovered to some extent. This recovery in the fracture energy {{could be attributed to}} the reversible effect of plasticization of the bulk adhesives, as well as the rebonding between the adhesive and the substrate during drying at 150 C. XPS analysis of DCB failure surfaces suggested that diffusion of Cu to the Au surface might have occurred on the Au/Ni/Cu plated PCB substrates during aging. Copper oxide on the substrate surface upon exposure of the conductive <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> to the hot/wet environment has also been observed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a new {{theoretical}} model is developed {{to characterize the}} damage of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint.</b> Elastic modulus of adhesive joints is an important parameter to represent damage characteristics. Based {{on the fact that}} the thickness of the adhesive layer is very small, it is reasonable to believe that damage will decrease the tension modulus of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> while the compression modulus will keep unchanged. Modeling the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> as an interface with different modulus in tension and compression, and applying integral transform method, we solve the associated nonlinear boundary problem to obtain the nonlinear ultrasonic waves transmitting through the adhesive layer. With this nonlinear ultrasonic wave, variation of elastic modulus and damage variable of the adhesive layer are thereafter characterized nondestructively by a nonlinear coefficient...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of adhesive bonding in structural joints in many applications, the interest in the behaviour of <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> under cyclic loading has increased as well.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to predict the failure load in single lap <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> subjected to tensile loading by using artificial neural networks. Experimental data obtained from the literature cover the single lap <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> with various geometric models under the tensile loading. The data are arranged in a format such that two input parameters cover the length and width of bond area in single lap <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> and the corresponding output is the ultimate failure load. An artificial neural network model was developed to estimate relationship between failure loads by using geometric dimensions of bond area as input data. A three-layer feedforward artificial neural network that utilized Levenberg–Marquardt learning algorithm model was used in order to train network. It was observed that artificial neural network model can estimate failure load of single lap <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> with acceptable error. Mean absolute percentage error and Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency values of both training and testing data were 3. 523 and 3. 524 and 0. 997 and 0. 992, respectively.

40|$|National audienceIn industry, {{achieving}} a perfect <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> is a quite complicated matter.

30|$|The {{influence}} of temperature {{on the strength}} of <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> is an important factor to consider in the design of <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints.</b> The strength of <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> at different temperature depends on the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), cure shrinkage of adhesive and properties of the adhesive and adherend. Many researchers [95 – 100] studied the temperature effect on the composite bonded <b>joint</b> strength. Generally <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> strength degrades at higher temperature and improves at lower temperatures. The quasi-static tensile behavior of adhesively-bonded double-lap joints, composed of pultruded GFRP laminates and an epoxy adhesive, was investigated under temperatures ranging between −[*] 35  °C and 60  °C. The highest strength was obtained at 40  °C due to a statistical size effect caused by the smoothing of the normal tensile and shear stress peaks [97]. At temperatures above Tg, strength and stiffness decreased following the trend of the thermomechanical behavior of the adhesive [97, 98]. It would be beneficial to select the adhesive and composite patch material with higher glass transition temperature, which allow a better performance of the repair joint at higher temperature too.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} the paper is related to {{problems}} with numerical errors in the finite difference method used to solve equations {{of the theory of}} elasticity describing 2 - dimensional adhesive joints in the plane stress state. Adhesive joints are described in terms of displacements by four elliptic partial differential equations of the second order with static and kinematic boundary conditions. If <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> is constrained as a statically determinate body and is loaded by a self-equilibrated loading, the finite difference solution is sensitive to kinematic boundary conditions. Displacements computed at the constraints are not exactly zero. Thus, the solution features a numerical error as if the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> was not in equilibrium. Herein this phenomenon is called numerical non-equilibrium. The disturbances in displacements and stress distributions can be decreased or eliminated by a correction of loading acting on the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> or by smoothing of solutions based on Dirichlet boundary value problem...|$|E
