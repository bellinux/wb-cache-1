5|$|Cyclone Rewa {{affected}} Papua New Guinea on {{two separate}} occasions {{while it was}} active, with the cyclone first affecting the archipelago between 28December and 1January, before grazing the archipelago between 12-14January. Before Rewa affected the country, cyclone alerts and warnings were issued for Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands, while authorities urged people {{not to go to}} beaches. As it affected the archipelago, Rewa brought heavy rainfall, high seas, and wind gusts of up to 100km/h (60mph) to parts of the archipelago including Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands. The hardest hit areas were communities near major river systems, with the cyclone blocking roads, destroying a church, bridges, homes and gardens with vital crops such as coffee and copra destroyed. In total, Cyclone Rewa left around 3500people homeless and caused 17deaths, 8 of which were due to flooding. Nine other people went missing while travelling to Rossel Island after their boat was caught up in high seas associated with Rewa. They were later presumed dead by the National Disaster and Emergency Service, after a local search and rescue mission found wreckage of the boat. At 00:00UTC on 30December, the <b>automatic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>station</b> at Jingo on Rossel island recorded a maximum sustained wind of 55km/h (35mph).|$|E

25|$|In July 1946, the Bureau of Ships became {{involved}} in a program to develop <b>automatic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>station</b> buoys. As a perspective part of this program, they conducted a preliminary investigation into the feasibility of mooring a buoy. The investigation concluded that the buoy's hull size was of insufficient length to be moored in 3600 ft of water. To support such a mooring, a similar shaped hull had to be 20 ft (6 m) long and displace approximately 20,000 lb. This was to become the prototype of the buoy {{now known as the}} NOMAD.|$|E
500|$|During {{the final}} week of December 1978, an area of {{atmospheric}} convection developed over northern Australia and surrounding areas. During 28 December, an {{area of low pressure}} developed over the eastern Arnhem Land within this area of atmospheric convection. Over the next day the system moved northwestward toward the Gulf of Carpentaria and developed further, with the first gale force wind associated with the system reported from an <b>automatic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>station</b> on 29 December. The system was subsequently named Peter by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) after it moved into the Gulf and developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After being named, Peter continued to intensify further as it tracked southeastward toward the Cape York Peninsula.|$|E

500|$|During November 17, {{warnings}} {{were issued}} by the Solomon Islands Meteorological Service for parts of Temotu Province in the Solomon Islands, after {{it became apparent that}} Tia was moving towards the eastern most islands of Anuta and Tikopia. During that day the system affected the province and came to within [...] of Anuta at around 1800UTC on November 17, before passing near to Tikopia six hours later. The southern most Solomon Island of Tikopia was the worst affected island, with 90% of all dwellings destroyed and the remaining 10% either having walls destroyed or roofs blown off. As a result, more than 1000 people were left homeless on the island, which was declared a disaster area by the Solomon Islands National Disaster Council. The cyclone also destroyed seven of the eight church buildings and {{all but one of the}} classroom buildings belonging to the two primary schools. Food crops were destroyed with all coconut trees either blown down or uprooted. High seas and waves caused extensive damage to the coasts and flooded low-lying areas, which damaged the taro, other food crops and the water supply on the island due to salt spray.

500|$|Over {{the next}} few days the system started to weaken as it passed through the French Polynesian Society Islands, and became the first major {{tropical}} cyclone to affect French Polynesia since 1983. During December 12, Wasa passed through the French Polynesian Austral Islands and passed directly over Tubuai. Later that day, the FMS reported that the system had weakened into a tropical depression, before the NWOC issued their final advisory on Wasa during December 13. However, gale-force winds remained associated with the depression, in particular within the systems southeastern quadrant, the system subsequently turned and started to move towards the east-northeast and entered into warmer waters near the Tuamotus. the FMS subsequently reported during December 14, that the system had regenerated into a category one tropical cyclone and renamed it: Arthur, for various reasons including operational purposes and to avoid confusion among recipients of their warnings. During that day the system gradually intensified further, as it passed about [...] to the north-northwest of the atoll: Mururoa, with the <b>automatic</b> <b>weather</b> <b>station</b> there reporting sustained wind speeds of 70km/h (45mph). At 12:00UTC, the FMS reported that Wasa–Arthur had re-peaked with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of , which made it a category 2 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale. During the next day the system maintained its peak intensity and moved through the uninhabited Acteon Group of islands and several other atolls, before as Wasa-Arthur turned eastwards, the NWOC decided to classify the storm as Tropical Cyclone 08P, with peak 1-minute sustained wind speeds of [...] During December 16, the system started to gradually weaken as it turned more towards the east, before it degenerated into a shallow depression late the next day.
