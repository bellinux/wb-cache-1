5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E
5|$|Physical damage can <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> {{value of}} carrot crops. The two main forms of damage are splitting, whereby a {{longitudinal}} crack develops during growth {{that can be}} a few centimetres to {{the entire length of the}} root, and breaking, which occurs postharvest. These disorders can affect over 30% of commercial crops. Factors associated with high levels of splitting include wide plant spacing, early sowing, lengthy growth durations, and genotype.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} glacier retreat on the park's {{ecosystems}} {{is not fully}} known, but {{plant and animal species}} that are dependent on cold water could suffer due to a loss of habitat. Reduced seasonal melting of glacial ice may also affect stream flow during the dry summer and fall seasons, reducing water table levels and increasing the risk of forest fires. The loss of glaciers will <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> aesthetic visual appeal that glaciers provide to visitors.|$|E
5000|$|The sling lift {{has several}} advantages. It allows heavy {{patients}} {{to be transferred}} while decreasing stress on caregivers while <b>also</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> number of nursing staff required to move patients. It <b>also</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> chance of orthopedic injury from lifting patients.|$|R

5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|Most of the gyromitrin must {{be removed}} to render false morels edible. The {{recommended}} procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom {{it is recommended that}} they are cut into small pieces and parboiled twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. Each round of parboiling reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling. Drying the mushrooms can <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> concentration of gyromitrin; ten days of open air desiccation leads to the loss of 90% of gyromitrin. However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.|$|E
5|$|The small {{geographic}} {{ranges of}} the sea otter populations in California, Washington, and British Columbia mean a single major spill could be catastrophic for that state or province. Prevention of oil spills and preparation to rescue otters if one happens is a major focus for conservation efforts. Increasing the size and range of sea otter populations would <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> risk of an oil spill wiping out a population. However, because of the species' reputation for depleting shellfish resources, advocates for commercial, recreational, and subsistence shellfish harvesting have often opposed allowing the sea otter's range to increase, and there have even been instances of fishermen and others illegally killing them.|$|E
50|$|NASCAR <b>also</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> {{size of the}} Cup {{field from}} 43 to 40 cars.|$|R
50|$|Reduced drug cost- This reduced dose in turn <b>also</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> cost of drugs.|$|R

5|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} if and when to become pregnant, is vital to a woman's autonomy and well being, and contraception can protect girls and young women from the risks of early pregnancy and older women from the increased risks of unintended pregnancy. Adequate access to contraception can limit multiple pregnancies, {{reduce the need for}} potentially unsafe abortion and reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Some barrier forms of contraception such as condoms, <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> risk of STIs and HIV infection. Access to contraception allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and sexual health, increases empowerment, and enhances choices in education, careers and participation in public life. At the societal level, access to contraception is a key factor in controlling population growth, with resultant impact on the economy, the environment and regional development. Consequently, the United Nations considers access to contraception a human right that is central to gender equality and women's empowerment that saves lives and reduces poverty, and birth control has been considered amongst the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasive}} {{root system}} and strong growth can damage concrete foundations, buildings, flood defences, roads, paving, retaining walls and architectural sites. It can <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> capacity of channels in flood defences to carry water.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, a given PRT seat {{transports}} {{about three}} times as many passenger miles per day as a seat performing scheduled stops. So PRT should <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> number of needed seats threefold for a given number of passenger miles.|$|E

25|$|Some drugs may {{share the}} same P-450 {{specificity}} and thus competitively block their bio transformation. This may lead to accumulation of drugs metabolized by the enzyme. This type of drug interaction may <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> rate of generation of toxic substrate.|$|E
25|$|The {{most likely}} {{signature}} {{of such a}} methane eruption would be a sudden decrease in the ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in sediments, since methane clathrates are low in carbon-13; but the change {{would have to be}} very large, as other events can <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> percentage of carbon-13.|$|E

25|$|Narrow lanes {{cost less}} {{to build and}} maintain, but <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> {{capacity}} of a road to convey traffic. On rural roads, narrow lanes are likely to experience higher rates of run-off-road and head-on collisions. Wider roads increase {{the time needed to}} walk across, and increase stormwater runoff.|$|E
25|$|In Coase's {{model of}} social costs, either choice ({{grandfathering}} or auctioning) leads to efficiency. In reality, grandfathering subsidizes polluters, meaning that polluting industries may {{be kept in}} business longer than would otherwise occur. Grandfathering may <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> rate of technological improvement towards less polluting technologies (Fisher et al.., 1996, p.417).|$|E
25|$|This would <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> {{dependence}} on traditional thermal sources and, with that, the vulnerability to {{high oil prices}} that the country started to face in 2005. El Salvador {{is also one of}} the countries included in the SIEPAC project, which will integrate the electricity network of the country with the rest of the Central American region.|$|E
50|$|An early {{development}} was the semi-tunnel crankshaft. This used large ball or roller bearings {{of the tunnel}} style for their centre bearings, but the end bearings (carrying the load of pistons on only a single side) remained with a small diameter bearing of conventional style. This <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> bearing cost, and <b>also</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> linear speed of these smaller bearings. This was important as it <b>also</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> speed of the crankcase oil seals alongside them.|$|R

25|$|New America Foundation defence analyst Bill Hartung {{has stated}} that the US {{government}} may try to reduce the overall costs of the program by {{reducing the number of}} aircraft it will procure. Hartung notes that this will increase the per unit cost for the international partners and <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> amount of business given to companies bidding on manufacturing contracts in partner countries as well.|$|E
25|$|Roach {{was also}} not above {{reducing}} the overall wages of his workforce in lean times, {{by as much as}} 15%, but when doing so would <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> rents by a corresponding degree for those workers living in housing provided by him. Roach was never able to supply housing for his entire workforce, but he did own about 100 houses in Chester, which were mostly rented by his foremen and other key personnel.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen: There {{have been}} anecdotal reports from those {{with easy access}} to a {{breathing}} oxygen supply– medical staff, and military pilots— that oxygen can <b>also</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> symptoms of hangovers sometimes caused by alcohol consumption. The {{theory is that the}} increased oxygen flow resulting from oxygen therapy improves the metabolic rate, and thus increases the speed at which toxins are broken down. However, one source states that (in an aviation context) oxygen has no effect on physical impairment caused by hangover.|$|E
