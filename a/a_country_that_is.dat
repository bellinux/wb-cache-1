The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south, and includes over 100 smaller named islands such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight.|$|E
5|$|Although {{based on}} reality, Chain Gang changes the facts {{slightly}} {{to appeal to}} Depression-era audiences by making Allen's return home one to <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> struggling economically, even though Burns returned to the roaring twenties. The film's bleak, anti-establishment ending shocked audiences. Laughter in Hell, a 1933 film directed by Edward L. Cahn and starring Pat O'Brien, was inspired in part by I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. O'Brien plays a railroad engineer who kills his wife and her lover in a jealous rage, and is sent to prison. The dead man's brother ends up being the warden of the prison and torments O'Brien's character. O'Brien and several others revolt, killing the warden and escaping with his new lover (Gloria Stuart). The film, rediscovered in 2012, drew controversy for its lynching scene in which several black men were hanged. Reports vary if the blacks were hanged alongside other white men, or by themselves. The New Age (an African American weekly newspaper) film critic praised the filmmakers for being courageous enough to depict the atrocities that were occurring in some Southern states.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 Switzerland {{became a}} full {{member of the}} United Nations, leaving the Vatican City as the last widely {{recognised}} state without full UN membership. Switzerland is {{a founding member of}} the EFTA, but is not a member of the European Economic Area. An application for membership in the European Union was sent in May 1992, but not advanced since the EEA was rejected in December 1992 when Switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the EEA. There have since been several referendums on the EU issue; due to a mixed reaction from the population the membership application has been frozen. Nonetheless, Swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the EU, and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the European Union. Switzerland, together with Liechtenstein, has been completely surrounded by the EU since Austria's entry in 1995. On 5 June 2005, Swiss voters agreed by a 55% majority to join the Schengen treaty, a result that was regarded by EU commentators as a sign of support by Switzerland, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies.|$|E

25|$|Afghans are {{regarded}} with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their tribe loyalty {{and for their}} readiness {{to use force to}} settle disputes. As tribal warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreigners to conquer them. One writer considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle. There are various Afghan tribes, and an estimated 2–3 million nomads.|$|E
25|$|A {{great deal}} of initial support came from Israel, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not {{recognised}} by the neighbouring Muslim-majority nations of Malaysia, Indonesia, or Brunei. The main fear after independence was an invasion by Malaysia. Israeli Defense Force (IDF) commanders were tasked with creating the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) from scratch, and Israeli instructors were brought in to train Singaporean soldiers. Military courses were conducted according to the IDF's format, and Singapore adopted a system of conscription and reserve service based on the Israeli model. Singapore still maintains strong security ties with Israel {{and is one of}} the biggest buyers of Israeli arms and weapons systems. The MATADOR is one example of recent Singaporean–Israeli collaboration.|$|E
25|$|Buffett {{viewed the}} United States' {{expanding}} trade deficit as {{a trend that}} will devalue the US dollar and US assets. He predicted that the US dollar will lose value in the long run, {{as a result of}} putting a larger portion of ownership of US assets in the hands of foreigners. In his letter to shareholders in March 2005, he predicted that in another ten years' time the net ownership of the U.S. by outsiders would amount to $11 trillion. Americans... would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to their creditors and owners abroad. <b>A</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> now aspiring to an 'ownership society' will not find happiness in – and I'll use hyperbole here for emphasis– a 'sharecropping society’.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, several {{parties have}} {{expressed}} concern that Doomsday presents negativity in England's latent view of Scotland based on their history. Angus MacNeil, member of the Scottish National Party, said of the film's impact: [...] "The complimentary part {{is that people are}} thinking about Scotland as we are moving more and more towards independence. But the film depicts <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> still the plaything of London. It is decisions made in London that has led to it becoming a quarantine zone." ...|$|E
