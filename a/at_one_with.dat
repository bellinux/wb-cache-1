5|$|Many of the {{numerous}} human figures revel in an innocent, self-absorbed joy as they engage {{in a wide range}} of activities; some appear to enjoy sensory pleasures, others play unselfconsciously in the water, and yet others cavort in meadows with a variety of animals, seemingly <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> nature. In the middle of the background, a large blue globe resembling a fruit pod rises in the middle of a lake. Visible through its circular window is a man holding his right hand close to his partner's genitals, and the bare buttocks of yet another figure hover in the vicinity. According to Fraenger, the eroticism of the center frame could be considered either as an allegory of spiritual transition or a playground of corruption.|$|E

25|$|The successors of Obelerio {{inherited}} a united Venice. By the Pax Nicephori (803-814), the two emperors had recognised that Venice {{belonged to the}} Byzantine sphere of influence. Many centuries later, the Venetians claimed that the treaty had recognised Venetian de facto independence, {{but the truth of}} this claim is doubted by modern scholars. A Byzantine fleet sailed to Venice in 807 and deposed the Doge, replacing him with a Byzantine governor. Nevertheless, during the reign of the Participazio family, Venice grew into its modern form. Though Heraclean by birth, Agnello, the first Participazio doge, was an early immigrant to Rialto and his dogeship was marked by the expansion of Venice towards the sea via the construction of bridges, canals, bulwarks, fortifications, and stone buildings. The modern Venice, <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> the sea, was being born. Agnello was succeeded by his son Giustiniano, who stole the remains of Saint Mark the Evangelist from Alexandria, took them to Venice, and made him the republic's patron saint.|$|E

25|$|Sonya {{becomes the}} {{convenor}} {{of the local}} Gambler's Anonymous support group and meets Patricia Pappas, her neighbour Chris's (James Mason) mother. She learns that Patricia does not know that Chris's boyfriend Hudson Walsh (Remy Hii) is serving time in prison for murder, and inadvertently reveals Chris's secret to her. Soon after Patricia is arrested for theft to fund her gambling, leading to Chris discovering her secret. Chris is angry with Sonya, calling her a hypocrite. However, Chris {{come to terms with}} his mother's problem, and turns to Sonya for advice. Sonya spends less time at home with Toadie, Callum and Nell, causing strain on her marriage. Toadie hires Naomi Canning as his personal assistant and her mother, Sheila (Colette Mann), warns Sonya to be wary of her daughter. Sonya reluctantly allows Callum to go to the United States after he wins an overseas scholarship. The problems in the Rebecchi marriage continue when Sonya starts spending all of her time helping Mark Brennan and Bailey Turner (Calen Mackenzie) through their issues. Sonya and Toadie have a big argument in public, and Sonya goes away with Nell. On her return, she learns Naomi kissed Toadie and Sonya slaps her during a confrontation. She later apologises to Naomi. Sonya and Toadie agree to cut back on their work, so that they can spend more time together, and eventually convinces Naomi to return to working for Jarrod as he loses customers. Sonya supports Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) when he falls ill with depression, allowing him to visit the nursery to be <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> nature. When Paul recovers, he uses the nursery, and Sonya, as a marketing campaign to try to get himself re-elected as mayor; however, the nursery is trashed by Jayden Warley (Khan Oxenham) in revenge as his mother Sue Parker (Kate Gorman) is the stand-in mayor. Paul convinces Sonya not to press charges against Jayden and Sonya realises that Paul did this to blackmail Sue into standing down as mayor.|$|E
500|$|Fränger {{believed}} The Garden of Earthly Delights {{was commissioned}} by the order's Grand Master. Later critics have agreed that, because of their obscure complexity, Bosch's [...] "altarpieces" [...] {{may well have been}} commissioned for non-devotional purposes. The Homines intelligentia cult sought to regain the innocent sexuality enjoyed by Adam and Eve before the Fall. Fränger writes that the figures in Bosch's work [...] "are peacefully frolicking about the tranquil garden in vegetative innocence, <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> animals and plants and the sexuality that inspires them seems to be pure joy, pure bliss." [...] Fränger argued against the notion that the hellscape shows the retribution handed down for sins committed in the center panel. Fränger saw the figures in the garden as peaceful, naive, and innocent in expressing their sexuality, and <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> nature. In contrast, those being punished in Hell comprise [...] "musicians, gamblers, desecrators of judgment and punishment".|$|E

[...] She added that she [...] "had been thinking about Afghanistan and trying to enthuse new war poetry among contemporary poets." [...] The poem was broadcast one week after Duffy published a selection of poems she had commissioned from poets such as Sean O'Brien, Paul Muldoon and Daljit Nagra about the ongoing war in Afghanistan.|$|E

Some 5,000 of them were then shipped to the South Pacific. Parsons flew there himself, where he met with Admiral William F. Halsey at his headquarters in Noumea. He arranged for Parsons to take VT fuzes out {{with him on the}} cruiser [...] On 6 January 1943, Helena was part of a cruiser force that bombarded Munda in the Solomon Islands. On the return trip, the cruisers were attacked by four Aichi D3A (Val) dive bombers. Helena fired <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> a VT fuze.

500|$|Fairy tales {{were often}} found in chapbooks—cheap, {{disposable}} literature—which contained sensational stories such as Jack the Giant Killer along with lewder tales such as How to restore a lost Maidenhead, or solder a Crackt one. Chapbooks were {{the literature of the}} poor and Trimmer attempted to separate children's literature from texts she associated with the lower classes. Trimmer criticized the values associated with fairy tales, accusing them of perpetuating irrationality, superstition, and unfavorable images of stepparents. Rather than seeing Trimmer as a censor of fairy tales, therefore, children's literature scholar Nicholas Tucker has argued, [...] "by considering fairy tales as fair game for criticism rather than unthinking worship, Mrs Trimmer is <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> scholars today who have also written critically about the ideologies found in some individual stories".|$|E
500|$|Trimmer {{is perhaps}} most famous now for her {{condemnation}} of fairy tales, such as the various translations of Charles Perrault's Histoires ou contes du temps passé (originally published in 1697), because they endorsed an irrational {{view of the world}} and suggested that children could become successful too easily (in other words, {{they did not have to}} work). Chapbooks were the literature of the poor and Trimmer was attempting to separate children's literature from texts she associated with the lower classes; she also feared that children might gain access to this cheap literature without their parents' knowledge. Trimmer criticized the values associated with fairy tales, accusing them of perpetuating superstition and unfavourable images of stepparents.

500|$|During script development, {{the crew}} spent {{four to five}} months {{scouting}} locations, creating a [...] "constant {{going back and forth}} between script and location". The film was shot entirely on location within England on an 11-week schedule during the 2004 summer. Co-producer Paul Webster noted that [...] "it is quite unusual for a movie this size to be shot entirely on location. Part of Joe 's idea was to try to create a reality which allows the actors to relax and feel <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> their environment." [...] Working under production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorator Katie Spencer, the crew filmed on seven estates in six different counties. Because [...] "nothing exists in the United Kingdom that is untouched by the twenty-first century", many of the sites required substantial work to make them suitable for filming. Visual effects company Double Negative digitally restored several locations to make them contemporaneous; they eradicated weeds, enhanced gold plating on window frames, and removed anachronisms such as gravel driveways and electricity pylons. Double Negative also developed the typeface used for the film's title sequence.|$|E
500|$|Cook reads {{further into}} the concept of child {{empowerment}} in Joe 90, writing that the series creates a [...] "technological utopia" [...] around youth, remarking, [...] "Through the character of Joe, his brain hardwired {{at the start of}} each episode into the BIG RAT supercomputer, the young are shown to be literally <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> technology." [...] He adds that the instant access to brain patterns that the BIG RAT affords to Joe may be interpreted as heralding the development of the Internet over a decade after Joe 90 was produced. With his intellectual horizons broadened, Joe becomes the manifestation of homo superior, yet his youthfulness grants him the power to change the fraught political world in ways that no adult could due to the limitations of their imagination. In this respect, Cook holds up Joe 90 as a precursor to the 1970s television series The Tomorrow People, which also concerned ideas of human transcendence in children. This idea, Cook says, was evident in the title of Joe 90 itself: [...] "no longer is he a nine-year-old boy but instead his status and capacities have been multiplied tenfold to transform him into agent 'Joe 90', his name an appealing futuristic echo of the then distant year of 1990." ...|$|E
500|$|Foley has {{praised the}} group's musical style on several occasions. He {{described}} the concept as innovative, {{as the music}} [...] "is not nursery rhyme, it actually has a top 40 essence to it but the lyrics are for kids." [...] He suggested this musical appeal for all ages {{as a reason for}} the group having a large teenage and adult fanbase. He cited the Wiggles as an influence of Hi-5, however he said that the respective groups have different [...] "styles of music". Hi-5 has been successful internationally. Foley explained how kids are universal and [...] "love to hear music", suggesting that the music is part of how international audiences connect to the group. Robinson stated the cast were encouraged to write their own music for the group, which all of the original members did, and by 2015 said she still receives occasional royalty cheques for her work. Original member of the Wiggles, and classical musician, Phillip Wilcher declared that Hi-5 [...] "successfully explore the essential components that come together to make music"; he detailed how the educational appeal [...] "seems to happen gently and [...] seem so <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> their audience of young folk... They also seem to know the subtle difference between childlike and childish".|$|E
