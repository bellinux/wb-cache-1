The evaluation index system of equipment <b>maintenance</b> support <b>capability</b> is established according to the evaluation index establishing principles. Cloud barycenter evaluation method is applied to equipment <b>maintenance</b> support <b>capability</b> evaluation on basis of the established evaluation index system. The application steps of cloud barycenter evaluation method to equipment <b>maintenance</b> support <b>capability</b> evaluation are analyzed. A calculating example for equipment <b>maintenance</b> support <b>capability</b> using the proposed algorithm is presented and the evaluation results are achieved using the weighted deflection degree which is used to demonstrate the deflection degree between equipment <b>maintenance</b> support <b>capability</b> and its perfect state. The correctness and validity of the proposed method is verified by the calculating results, which provide an efficient method for equipment <b>maintenance</b> support <b>capability</b> evaluation...|$|R

50|$|The Common Missile was {{designed}} as a four-stage solid propellant, stellar-inertial guided intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering up to six Mark 21 reentry vehicles to independent targets. It is propelled from a canister by a gas generator prior to first stage ignition. The post boost vehicle consists of a structure to house the guidance and solid propulsion systems and a platform to mount the reentry vehicles. The post boost vehicle provides the reentry vehicle spacing and deployment maneuvers. The basic dimensions, length, and diameter, were derived from submarine launcher volumetric constraints. The booster stages were sized to provide for Navy guidance access requirements at the II-III interstage and for <b>at-sea</b> <b>maintenance</b> access. The missile {{was designed}} to fill the current Trident submarine tube.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe United States Navy {{is in the}} process of considering the use of Mobile Maintenance Facilities to provide an intermediate level <b>maintenance</b> <b>capability</b> to MH- 53 E helicopter minesweeping and countermeasure squadrons of four and seven aircraft while on deployment to remote locations. This thesis considers two alternatives; (1) no intermediate <b>maintenance</b> <b>capability</b> and, (2) full capability. Because of limited data only the repair of avionics components are considered. The alternative corresponding to no <b>maintenance</b> <b>capability</b> provides the increased inventory required to meet expected failures. The second alternative involves all of the elements of intermediate maintenance at a remote site as well as the needed supply support. Present value analyses of the life cycle costs are utilized to determine the least cost alternative. The results suggest that intermediate maintenance activities are the least cost alternative for avionics support for a seven-aircraft detachment and the most costly alternative for the four-aircraft detachment.

40|$|Adaptive {{action in}} a {{constantly}} changing environment requires the ability to maintain intentions and goals over time and to flexibly switch between these goals in response to significant changes. Dreisbach and Goschke (2004) argued that positive affect modulates these antagonistic control demands {{in favor of a}} more flexible but also more distractible behavior. In the present paper, the author will present further evidence for the affective modulation of cognitive control: mild positive affect reduced <b>maintenance</b> <b>capability</b> in a simple cuing paradigm (the AX Continuous Performance Task) as compared to negative and neutral affect. This reduced <b>maintenance</b> <b>capability</b> results in costs when a to be maintained goal has to be executed and conversely results in benefits when a to be maintained goal unexpectedly changes.
