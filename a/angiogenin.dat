500|$|The chief {{characteristic}} of proteins that also allows their diverse {{set of functions}} is their ability to bind other molecules specifically and tightly. The region of the protein responsible for binding another molecule {{is known as the}} binding site and is often a depression or [...] "pocket" [...] on the molecular surface. This binding ability is mediated by the tertiary structure of the protein, which defines the binding site pocket, and by the chemical properties of the surrounding amino acids' side chains. Protein binding can be extraordinarily tight and specific; for example, the ribonuclease inhibitor protein binds to human <b>angiogenin</b> with a sub-femtomolar dissociation constant (<10−15 M) but does not bind at all to its amphibian homolog onconase (>1 M). Extremely minor chemical changes such as the addition of a single methyl group to a binding partner can sometimes suffice to nearly eliminate binding; for example, the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase specific to the amino acid valine discriminates against the very similar side chain of the amino acid isoleucine.|$|E

Later, four Nobel prizes were awarded to investigators working with the "ribonuclease", RNase A from bovine pancreas. Their work greatly advanced our knowledge of protein chemistry and biology. Today, well over 100 homologs of RNase A {{have been identified in}} all tetrapods, and recently in fishes. Based on the latter findings, a vertebrate RNase superfamily has been appropriately defined, with RNase A as its prototype. Thus, the success of the RNase structure and function not only in promoting the advance of biosciences, but also in evolution, has become clear. Several RNases from the superfamily are endowed with non-catalytic "special" bioactions. Among these are <b>angiogenins,</b> characterized by their ability to stimulate the formation of blood vessels. Recently, four RNases have been identified in Danio rerio, or zebrafish, produced as recombinant proteins, and characterized. As two of them have angiogenic activity, the hypothesis is made that the whole superfamily of vertebrate RNases evolved from early angiogenic RNases. Given the microbicidal activity of some mammalian <b>angiogenins,</b> and of the reported fish <b>angiogenins,</b> the alternative hypothesis is also discussed, that the ancestral RNases were host-defense RNases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We present {{sequences}} of five novel RNase A superfamily ribonuclease genes of the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana. All five genes encode ribonucleases {{that are similar}} to Onconase, a cytotoxic ribonuclease isolated from oocytes of R. pipiens. With amino acid sequence data from 14 ribonucleases from three Rana species (R. catesbeiana, R. japonica, and R. pipiens), we have con-structed bootstrap-supported phylogenetic trees that re-organize these ribonucleases into five distinct lineages— the pancreatic ribonucleases (RNases 1), the eosinophil-associated ribonucleases (RNases 2, 3, and 6), the ribonucleases 4, the <b>angiogenins</b> (RNases 5) and the Rana ribonucleases—with the Rana ribonucleases no more closely related to the <b>angiogenins</b> than they are to any of the other ribonuclease lineages shown. Further phylogenetic analysis suggests the division of the Rana ribonucleases into two subclusters (A and B), with posi-tive (Darwinian) selection (dN/dS> 1. 0) and an elevated rate of radical nonsynonymous substitution (dR) contrib-uting to the rapid diversification of ribonucleases within each cluster. This pattern of evolution—rapid diversifi-cation via positive selection among {{sequences of}} a mul-tigene cluster—bears striking resemblance to what we have described for the eosinophil-associated ribonucle-ase genes of the rodent Mus musculus, a finding that may have implications with respect the physiologic function of this unique family of proteins...|$|R

Reconstitution of lamina propria IgA production in AID–/– mice recovered the normal composition of gut flora and abolished the local and systemic activation of the immune system.

40|$|For {{the first}} time fish RNases have been {{isolated}} and characterized. Their functional and structural properties indicate that they belong to the RNase A superfamily (or tetrapod RNase superfamily), now more appropriately described as the vertebrate RNase superfamily. Our findings suggest why previously repeated efforts to isolate RNases from fish tissues have met with no success; fish RNases have a very low ribonucleolytic activity, and their genes have a low sequence identity with those of mammalian RNases. The investigated RNases are from the bony fish Danio rerio (or zebrafish). Their cDNAs have been cloned and expressed, and the three recombinant proteins have been purified to homogeneity. Their characterization has revealed that they have indeed a very low RNA-degrading activity, when {{compared with that of}} RNase A, the superfamily prototype, but comparable with that of mammalian angiogenins; that two of them have angiogenic activity that is inhibited by the cytosolic RNase inhibitor. These data and a phylogenetic analysis indicate that angiogenic fish RNases are the earliest diverging members of the vertebrate superfamily, suggesting that ribonucleases with angiogenic activity were the ancestors of all ribonucleases in the superfamily.

Three of them (RL 1, RL 2 and RL 3) were purified and showed ribonuclease activity at pH 7. 5 with yeast RNA as substrate. RL 1 is identical to rat pancreatic ribonuclease (ribonuclease 1). N-terminal sequence analysis showed the {{presence of}} the native protein and several N-terminally degraded components. RL 2 and RL 3 were N-terminally blocked proteins. After acidic cleavage or CNBr digestion, several parts of their sequences were determined. RL 2 has high sequence similarity with neurotoxin-type ribonucleases (ribonucleases 2, 3 and 6). The amino acid sequence of rat liver-type ribonuclease (ribonuclease 4) was determined from a liver cDNA library. It differs at about 20 % of the amino acid positions from other mammalian liver-type ribonucleases.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was the {{production}} and haracterization of new homologs from two superfamilies of phylogenetic interest: the superfamily of -crystallin and that of RNases. Crystallins are proteins with key roles in lens function in vertebrates, but also extensively studied as models of molecular evolution. They have been studied in vertebrates as well as in unicellular organisms. Here, for the first time, a novel homolog from the earliest divergent metazoan, the Geodia cydonium sponge, has been isolated, both as a recombinant protein and from the natural source. The protein, named geodin, has been characterized in its main physico-chemical properties, including its behaviour with chemical denaturants, its thermal stability, and its stabilization with Ca 2 + ions. Over one hundred homologs to bovine pancreatic RNase A have been isolated so far, and have constituted the “tetrapod RNase superfamily”. The isolation in this study of RNases from fish has led {{for the first time to}} the definition of a “vertebrate RNase superfamily”. The novel fish RNases, identified in the genome of zebrafish (Danio rerio), have been expressed as recombinant proteins and found to be active as RNA degrading enzymes, albeit poorly active. One of them has been found to be endowed with angiogenic activity, an activity found to be date only in mammalian RNases. These findings, and the positions of the three proteins in the RNase phylogenetic tree have led to the proposal that fish RNases might be ancestors to both tetrapod pancreatic-type RNases, as well as to mammalian <b>angiogenins...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Angiogenin</b> {{is a key}} protein {{implicated in}} {{angiogenesis}} in normal and tumor growth. <b>Angiogenin</b> interacts with endothelial and smooth muscle cells resulting in cell migration, invasion, proliferation and formation of tubular structures. Ang binds to actin of both smooth muscle and endothelial cells to form complexes that activate proteolytic cascades which upregulate the production of proteases and plasmin that degrade the laminin and fibronectin layers of the basement membrane. Degradation of the basement membrane and extracellular matrix allows the endothelial cells to penetrate and migrate into the perivascular tissue. Signal transduction pathways activated by Ang interactions at the cellular membrane of endothelial cells produce extracellular signal-related kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B/Akt. Activation of these proteins leads to invasion of the basement membrane and cell proliferation associated with further angiogenesis. The most important step in the angiogenesis process is the translocation of Ang to the cell nucleus. Once Ang has been translocated to the nucleus, it enhances rRNA transcription by binding to the CT-rich (CTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCCCTC) <b>angiogenin</b> binding element (ABE) within the upstream intergenic region of rDNA, which subsequently activates other angiogenic factors that induce angiogenesis.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>angiogenin</b> {{is unique}} {{among the many}} {{proteins}} {{that are involved in}} angiogenesis in that it is also an enzyme with an amino acid sequence 33% identical to that of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase) A. Ang has the same general catalytic properties as RNase A, it cleaves preferentially on the 3' side of pyrimidines and follows a transphosphorylation/hydrolysis mechanism. Although <b>angiogenin</b> contains many of the same catalytic residues as RNase A, it cleaves standard RNA substrates 105-106 times less efficiently than does RNase A. The reason for this inefficiency is due to the 117 residue consisting of a glutamine, which blocks the catalytic site. Removal of this residue through mutation increases the ribonuclease activity between 11 and 30 fold. Despite this apparent weakness, the enzymatic activity of Ang appears to be essential for biological activity: replacements of important catalytic site residues (Histidine13 and Histidine 114) invariably diminish both the ribonuclease activity toward tRNA by 10,000 fold and almost abolishes angiogenesis activities completely.|$|E
50|$|Other {{proteins}} {{belonging to}} the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily include: bovine seminal vesicle and brain ribonucleases; kidney non-secretory ribonucleases; liver-type ribonucleases; <b>angiogenin,</b> which induces vascularisation of normal and malignant tissues; eosinophil cationic protein, a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin with ribonuclease activity; and frog liver ribonuclease and frog sialic acid-binding lectin.

Function is not always conserved, however. Human <b>angiogenin</b> diverged from ribonuclease, for example, and while the two paralogs remain similar in tertiary structure, their functions within the cell are now quite different.|$|E

50|$|When a tumor {{stimulates the}} growth of new vessels, {{it is said to}} have {{undergone}} an 'angiogenic switch'. The principal stimulus for this angiogenic switch appears to be oxygen deprivation, although other stimuli such as inflammation, oncogenic mutations and mechanical stress may also play a role. The angiogenic switch leads to tumor expression of pro-angiogenic factors and increased tumor vascularization. Specifically, tumor cells release various pro-angiogenic paracrine factors (including <b>angiogenin,</b> vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β).

5000|$|Bound {{molecules}} {{are sometimes}} called a [...] "molecular complex"—the term generally refers to non-covalent associations.

Another biological example is the binding protein streptavidin, which has extraordinarily high affinity for biotin (vitamin B7/H, dissociation constant, Kd ≈10−14 mol/L). In such cases, if the reaction conditions change (e.g., the protein moves into an environment where biotin concentrations are very low, or pH or ionic conditions are altered), the reverse reaction can be promoted. For example, the biotin-streptavidin interaction can be broken by incubating the complex in water at 70 °C, without damaging either molecule.

40|$|International audienceThe {{ribonuclease}} <b>angiogenin</b> is {{a component}} of the mammalian stress response, and functions in both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous ways to promote tissue adaptation to injury. We recently showed that <b>angiogenin</b> regulates tissue homeostasis during AKI associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through the production of transfer RNA fragments that interfere with translation initiation and thereby alleviate ER stress. However, whether the paracrine signaling mediated by <b>angiogenin</b> secretion is a genuine component of the ER stress response to kidney injury is unknown. Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms by which <b>angiogenin</b> is secreted upon ER stress, and determined how it modulates the inflammatory microenvironment. In cultured renal epithelial cells, ER stress specifically induced <b>angiogenin</b> secretion under the selective control of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α, a key activator of the unfolded protein response. The transcription factors spliced X-box-binding protein 1 and p 65, which are activated by inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α upon ER stress, each bound the <b>angiogenin</b> promoter and controlled the amount of <b>angiogenin</b> secreted. Furthermore, p 65 promoted <b>angiogenin</b> transcription in an ER stress-dependent manner.

We show that wild-type <b>angiogenin</b> acts unidirectionally to induce RNA cleavage in astroglia, while the ALS-associated K 40 I mutant is also secreted and endocytosed, but fails to induce RNA cleavage. <b>Angiogenin</b> uptake into astroglia requires heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and engages clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We show that this uptake mechanism exists for mouse and human <b>angiogenin,</b> and delivers a functional RNase output. Moreover, we identify syndecan 4 as the <b>angiogenin</b> receptor mediating the selective uptake of <b>angiogenin</b> into astroglia. Our data provide new insights into the paracrine activities of <b>angiogenin</b> in the nervous system, and further highlight the critical role of non-neuronal cells in the pathogenesis of ALS...|$|E
40|$|Human <b>angiogenin</b> is {{progressively}} up-regulated in {{the prostate}} epithelial cells {{during the development}} of prostate cancer from prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to invasive adenocarcinoma. Mouse <b>angiogenin</b> is the most up-regulated gene in AKT-induced PIN in prostate-restricted AKT transgenic mice. These results prompted us to study the role that <b>angiogenin</b> plays in prostate cancer. Here, we report that, {{in addition to its}} well established role in mediating angiogenesis, <b>angiogenin</b> also directly stimulates prostate cancer cell proliferation. <b>Angiogenin</b> undergoes nuclear translocation in PC- 3 human prostate cancer cells grown both in vitro and in mice. Thus, knocking down <b>angiogenin</b> expression in PC- 3 human prostate adenocarcinoma cells inhibits ribosomal RNA transcription, in vitro cell proliferation, colony formation in soft agar, and xenograft growth in athymic mice. Blockade of nuclear translocation of <b>angiogenin</b> by the aminoglycoside antibiotic neomycin inhibited PC- 3 cell tumor growth in athymic mice and was accompanied by a decrease in both cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis. These results suggest that <b>angiogenin</b> has a dual effect, angiogenesis and cancer cell proliferation, in prostate cancer and may serve as a molecular target for drug development. Blocking nuclear translocation of <b>angiogenin</b> could have a combined benefit of antiangiogenesis and chemotherapy in treating prostate cancer...|$|E
40|$|The angiogenic factor, <b>angiogenin,</b> {{has been}} {{recently}} linked to both Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson Disease (PD). We have recently shown that endogenous <b>angiogenin</b> levels are dramatically reduced in an alpha-synuclein mouse model of PD and that exogenous <b>angiogenin</b> protects against cell loss in neurotoxin-based cellular models of PD. Here, we extend our studies {{to examine whether}} activation of the prosurvival Akt pathway is required for angiogenin’s neuroprotective effects against 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium (MPP+), as observed in ALS models, and to test the effect of virally-mediated overexpression of <b>angiogenin</b> in an in vivo PD model. Using a dominant negative Akt construct, we demonstrate that inhibition of the Akt pathway does not reduce the protective effect of <b>angiogenin</b> against MPP+ toxicity in the dopaminergic SH-SY 5 Y cell line. Furthermore, an ALS-associated mutant of <b>angiogenin,</b> K 40 I, which fails to induce Akt phosphorylation, was similar to wildtype <b>angiogenin</b> in protection against MPP+. These results confirm previous work showing neuroprotective effects of <b>angiogenin</b> against MPP+, and indicate that Akt is not required for this protective effect. We also investigated whether adeno-associated viral serotype 2 (AAV 2) -mediated overexpression of <b>angiogenin</b> protects against dopaminergic neuron loss in the 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model. We found that <b>angiogenin</b> overexpression using this approach does not reduce the MPTP-induced degeneration of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra, nor limit the depletion of dopamine and its metabolites in the striatum. Together, these finding...|$|E
40|$|<b>Angiogenin</b> is an angiogenic factor {{involved}} in tumorigenesis. However, {{the mechanism of}} angiogenin’s action remains elusive. In the present study, we identified fibulin 1, an extra-cellular matrix and plasma glycoprotein, as an angiogenin-interacting molecule by yeast two-hybrid screening. This interaction was further confirmed by two different approaches. First, fibulin 1 was co-immunoprecipitated with <b>angiogenin</b> by anti-angiogenin monoclonal antibody in vitro, suggesting <b>angiogenin</b> binds with fibulin 1 directly. Then fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis showed that fibulin 1 interacted with <b>angiogenin</b> in COS- 7 cells, showing that the binding could occur in a cellular context. As fibulin 1 {{plays an important role}} in cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and stabilizes new-forming blood vessel wall, the interaction between fibulin 1 and <b>angiogenin</b> might under-line one possible mechanism of <b>angiogenin</b> in angiogenesis and/or tumorigenesis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} of <b>angiogenin</b> isolated from bovine milk was deduced by gas-phase sequencing of the protein and its fragments. The protein contains 125 residues and has a calculated molecular mass of 14 577 Da. The sequence is highly homologous (65 % identity) to the sequence of human <b>angiogenin,</b> most of the differences being the result of conservative replacements. Like human <b>angiogenin,</b> the bovine protein is also homologous to bovine pancreatic RNase A (34 % identity) and the three major active site residues known {{to be involved in}} the catalytic process, His- 14, Lys- 41 and His- 115, are conserved. When tested against conventional substrates for RNase A activity, bovine <b>angiogenin</b> displays the same selective ribonucleolytic activity as human <b>angiogenin.</b> The sequence of bovine <b>angiogenin</b> contains the cell recognition tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp which is not present in the human protein...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether 5 {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) associate with ALS in 3 different populations. We also assessed the contribution of genotype to <b>angiogenin</b> levels in plasma and CSF. Methods: Allelic association statistics were calculated for polymorphisms in the ANG gene in 859 patients and 1047 controls from Sweden, Ireland and Poland. Plasma, serum and CSF <b>angiogenin</b> levels were quantified and stratified according to genotypes across the ANG gene. The contribution of SNP genotypes to variance in circulating <b>angiogenin</b> levels was estimated in patients and controls. Results: All SNPs showed association with ALS in the Irish group. The SNP rs 17114699 replicated in the Swedish cohort. No SNP associated in the Polish cohort. Age- and sex-corrected circulating <b>angiogenin</b> levels were significantly lower in patients than in controls (p, 0. 001). An allele dose-dependent regulation of <b>angiogenin</b> levels was observed in controls. This regulation was attenuated in the ALS cohort. A significant positive correlation between CSF plasma <b>angiogenin</b> levels was present in controls and abolished in ALS. Conclusions: ANG variants associate with ALS in the Irish and Swedish populations, {{but not in the}} Polish. There is evidence of dysregulation of <b>angiogenin</b> expression in plasma and CSF in sporadic ALS. <b>Angiogenin</b> expression is likely to b...|$|E
