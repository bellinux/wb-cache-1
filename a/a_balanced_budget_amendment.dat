5|$|Kemp was {{considered}} {{the star of the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp {{was considered}} the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement {{by the end of the}} year. In January 1995, Kemp's stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> <b>amendment</b> and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America. Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.|$|E
5|$|In {{the turmoil}} of the Global Financial Crisis, the focus across all EU member states has been {{gradually}} to implement austerity measures, {{with the purpose of}} lowering the budget deficits to levels below 3% of GDP, so that the debt level would either stay below -or start decline towards- the 60% limit defined by the Stability and Growth Pact. To further restore the confidence in Europe, 23 out of 27 EU countries also agreed to adopt the Euro Plus Pact, consisting of political reforms to improve fiscal strength and competitiveness; 25 out of 27 EU countries also decided to implement the Fiscal Compact which include the commitment of each participating country to introduce <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> <b>amendment</b> as part of their national law/constitution. The Fiscal Compact is a direct successor of the previous Stability and Growth Pact, but it is more strict, not only because criteria compliance will be secured through its integration into national law/constitution, but also because it starting from 2014 will require all ratifying countries not involved in ongoing bailout programmes, to comply with the new strict criteria of only having a structural deficit of either maximum 0.5% or 1% (depending on the debt level). Each of the eurozone countries being involved in a bailout programme (Greece, Portugal, and Ireland) was asked both to follow a programme with fiscal consolidation/austerity, and to restore competitiveness through implementation of structural reforms and internal devaluation, i.e. lowering their relative production costs. The measures implemented to restore competitiveness in the weakest countries are needed, not only to build the foundation for GDP growth, but also in order to decrease the current account imbalances among eurozone member states.|$|E

25|$|Despite her {{reputation}} as a liberal, Moseley Braun possessed something of a centrist record on economic issues. She voted for the 1993 budget package and against the welfare reform laws passed in 1996, but on many other matters she was more conservative. Moseley Braun {{voted in favor of}} the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and lawsuit reform measures like the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (she was also among the minority of Democrats to support the even more controversial Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act of 1995). She also voted contrary to the interests of the more populist wing of the party by voting for the Freedom to Farm Act and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Like her Illinois colleague, fellow Democrat Paul Simon, she voted in favor of <b>a</b> <b>Balanced</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Amendment</b> to the United States Constitution and also to place a nuclear spent fuel storage facility in Nevada, a move strongly opposed by many Democrats, especially former Majority Leader Harry Reid.|$|E
25|$|Watts ran for Congress in 1994 {{to succeed}} Dave McCurdy, who had {{announced}} his retirement from the House of Representatives {{to run for the}} Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> <b>amendment</b> and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending. After a hard-fought primary campaign against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49percent to Apple's 48percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92percent name recognition in one poll. Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks. Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win. On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52percent of the vote as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction. He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House. Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.|$|E

500|$|Two rival {{plans were}} then {{prepared}} by the Senate Democrats and House Republicans. [...] The Democratic plan would immediately raise the debt limit by $2.7 trillion, enough to last beyond the 2012 elections, and would decrease spending by $900 billion over ten years. [...] The Republican plan would cut a total of $850 billion over ten years, and would raise the debt limit in two stages: by $1 trillion immediately, enough to last until early 2012, and then would form a bipartisan committee to recommend {{the second half of}} the budget cuts, which upon being passed by Congress would increase the debt limit by another $1.6 trillion. [...] Neither plan included revenue increases or cuts to entitlement programs. [...] The vote on the Republican plan was delayed several times as more conservative members of the caucus refused to support it. [...] After being altered to again require passage of <b>a</b> <b>Balanced</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Amendment</b> before the second stage of debt limit increases, it passed the House 218–210, with 22 Republicans opposing the bill. [...] It was defeated in the Senate two hours later by a vote of 59–41, as the Democratic plan was prepared to be taken up there.|$|E

500|$|On July 31, 2011, President Obama and the {{leadership}} of both legislative chambers reached a deal on the debt limit legislation. [...] The deal guaranteed $2.4 trillion in immediate and eventual debt limit increases. [...] It mandated $917 billion in spending cuts over ten years, of which $21 billion would {{be included in the}} FY2012 budget. [...] It would then give Congress a choice between either accepting the recommendation of a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction which would cut the deficit by $1.2–1.5 trillion through spending cuts and/or revenue increases, or accepting automatic budget cuts to national security funding (including defense spending) and to Medicare, which would start in the FY2013 budget. [...] Congress would also be required to vote on <b>a</b> <b>Balanced</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Amendment.</b> [...] On August 1, the Budget Control Act of 2011 passed the House 269–161, with 66 Republicans and 95 Democrats voting against the bill.

500|$|On March 2, Paul {{was one of}} nine {{senators}} to vote against a stopgap bill that cut $4billion from the budget and temporarily prevent a government shutdown, saying {{that it did not}} cut enough from the budget.

Both bills failed to pass the Senate. He later voted against stopgap measures on March 17 and April 8, both of which passed the senate. On April 14, He was one of 19 {{senators to}} vote against a budget that cut $38.5billion from the budget and fund the government {{for the remainder of the}} fiscal year.

500|$|A {{controversy}} {{arose in}} July 2011 over {{the raising of}} the federal debt limit, which was needed to prevent a default by the United States government. [...] Republicans in Congress demanded spending cuts in the budgets for 2012 and subsequent years in return for raising the debt limit. [...] On July 19, 2011, the Republican-led House passed a bill, the Cut, Cap and Balance Act, {{by a margin of}} 234–190 which would require $111 billion in cuts in 2012 spending levels, exempting defense, Medicare, and Social Security from these cuts, and would limit subsequent federal spending to about 20% of the gross national product as compared to the current 24%. [...] It did not immediately increase the debt limit, but would have required Congress to pass <b>a</b> <b>Balanced</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Amendment</b> to the United States Constitution before increasing the debt limit. [...] The bill was tabled by a vote of 51–46 in the Senate on July 22, and thus defeated. [...] An alternate plan proposed by the bipartisan Gang of Six senators and favored by the Obama administration would contain about $3.7 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade, including both new revenue and large spending cuts, including in entitlement healthcare and defense, failed to gain traction.|$|E
