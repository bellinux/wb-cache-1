25|$|The {{next two}} decades were a time of steady growth and {{prestige}} for Alpha Epsilon Pi, {{as well as other}} fraternities. Expansion was occurring at an incredible rate for the Greek system as a whole. However, with the onset of fighting in Vietnam in the early 1960s, fraternity life faltered. Liberal student bodies revolted against authority and the Greek system, which was seen as a conservative, elitist group. Membership plummeted and nearly half the chapter roll was lost. It almost looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been the end for Alpha Epsilon Pi. However the fraternity was able to reverse the trend and stabilize following the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the close}} of a September day in the year 1864, a crowd of {{students}} was collected on the Bowdoin campus near the Thorndike oak. Each class was not only represented, but present almost in its entirety; still, as the college at that time bore upon its rolls only about a hundred names, the reader is not to imagine the assembly as one of remarkable proportions. The several classes, without being grouped as separate bodies, were in a measure distinct, as if their members were drawn together by community of sentiment or interest. The center, of the throng was composed mainly of Sophomores who, to the melody of tin horns, devil's fiddles and watchmen's rattles, {{from time to time}} added vocal effects scarcely less loud and discordant. Next to them stood the open-eyed Freshmen, eagerly appreciative of the novelty of the scene; while most of the upper-class men were ranged along the outer edge or a little apart, and were endeavoring to preserve looks and attitudes of aloofness and indifference. The object of attraction appeared to be a tall, spare man who was standing upon a rude plank-and-barrel rostrum, and, whenever the uproar would permit, launching his remarks in a violent manner at the bystanders. He was apparently some sixty years of age. His head was uncovered, showing his hair thin and streaked with gray. His face was smooth except for a stubbly two days' growth of beard, and was wrinkled and browned by exposure to the weather. Beside him upon the platform rested a dilapidated silk hat which, as well as his suit of rusty black, looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been discarded some years before by its former owner. They were not, however, incongruous {{with the rest of his}} attire, since both his dickey above and his shirt below his black stock bore the same signs of poverty and neglect.|$|E
500|$|The Real Housewives of Atlanta {{has been}} {{moderately}} well received by critics. Writing for Common Sense Media, Melissa Camacho spoke favorably of the series' emphasis on [...] "a successful and powerful {{segment of the}} African-American community" [...] {{that appears to be}} frequently neglected by the popular television. Tim Hall from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer commented of his general distaste for reality television, particularly describing The Real Housewives of Orange County as [...] "utterly ridiculous". However, he admitted that the dynamic and conflict between the women, in addition to the wealthy lifestyles they led, to be [...] "somewhat entertaining". In a more mixed review, Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times joked that its portrayal of wealth served as [...] "the best choice for a time capsule of the Bling Decade" [...] when noting the economic downturn the United States experienced around the time that the series premiered, although more seriously stated that the housewives' luxuries [...] "was never all that enviable, and now it looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> not be viable." [...] Hanh Nguyen from Zap2It shared a similar sentiment, criticizing that the [...] "showy elite and rampant consumerism" [...] that the women regularly display [...] "seems rather out of touch" [...] given the United States' economic hardship, although she elaborated that the program [...] " [...] not by any means boring, but you do {{have to be in the}} mood to watch." ...|$|E

500|$|Peck {{and other}} {{commission}} members were {{not satisfied with}} the design proposals, and suggested some of their own. [...] Barber denigrated these in a letter to Roberts on June 8. [...] Peck had proposed that only the faces of Washington and Lafayette be shown, with no depiction {{of the rest of the}} head. [...] Barber stated, [...] "I am of the opinion that the heads of Washington and Lafayette should be treated from the sculptor's standpoint, and every effort be made to represent them with a grandeur and dignity commensurate with the position they fill in the Nation's history, which certainly could not be done if they are to be shown peeping out of a half moon." [...] At the instructions of Roberts, Barber went to New York and met with Peck over two days on June 14 and 15. Afterwards, Barber reported to the Mint Director, [...] "I think we will hear no more of the Lafayette prayer" [...] and that Peck now appreciated that the space available for a design, even on a silver dollar (the largest US coin) was limited, [...] "and as it is the desire of the Committee [...] to have the monument displayed, the prayer will have to find some other place". Although Barber indicated that the decision of the commission to represent the statue without its pedestal represented progress toward the point where he might engrave dies, [...] "I learned in New York that the work of the sculptor must be submitted to a committee in Paris who will have entire charge of the monument, and the sculptor's work has to be changed in any and every detail until it meets the approval of this Committee of Frenchmen... to me it looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be sometime in 1900." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{communicative}} goal {{includes the}} attention-impelling function, which explores another purpose of hesitation forms as being to dissociate oneself {{slightly from the}} harsh reality of what is to follow. With {{the use of a}} beat of time filled with a meaningless interjection, uncommitted people who are [...] "into distancing" [...] make use of such formulaic language to create a little distance between themselves and their words, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> lessen the impact of their words.|$|E

"Stupid", especially, {{looks to}} Gasparoli <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> {{have been written}} {{separately}} from the other words, as it is written much more clearly and off to the side. The swash extending leftward from the counter on the [...] "P" [...] in [...] "STUPID", struck him as unusually distinctive. [...] " [...] looks quite different, much more precise than any other letter in the note," [...] he says. It seems to Gasparoli to suggest a female writer, {{or at least one}} calmer and more intelligent than the lettering elsewhere on the note.|$|E

2500|$|One early theory {{suggested}} {{that all the}} music was recorded in a single, feverish, possibly manic phase and that after 19 albums the releases would stop. This appeared, at the time, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have some validity – the 21st album, Lost Cause, finished with a sidelong piece called [...] "The Electric End", a crazed instrumental featuring shouted vocals, electric guitar, and microphone feedback. Instead, this seems to have {{marked the end of}} the [...] "first band phase." [...] Then the 22nd album arrived and returned to the acoustic and vocal sound that is found on most of the first six Corwood albums (often referred to as [...] "the first acoustic phase"). This continued unabated for seven albums until, in 1999, The Beginning was released, which ended with a fifteen-minute-long work of instrumental piano. This ushered in the most controversial period of albums in Corwood's history – three albums of unaccompanied voice. Seemingly recorded on a voice-activated tape recorder, these [...] "spoken word songs" [...] ran up to half an hour in length and taxed even the most devoted followers. After these albums, though, the direction changed again and Jandek returned to a voice and guitar mixture with occasional harmonica, though the approach was different than the earlier recordings. The guitar was often electric and the voice was decidedly older than that on the previous albums. Further albums have continued the solo approach, though the instrument used has occasionally been a fretless bass, and the songs have stretched progressively longer and the lyrics have become even more personal. Though Corwood still releases albums like this (the most recent is What Was Out There Disappeared), they are now alternated with releases of the live band shows, which are remarkably different and feature unusually tight playing. He currently records at Houston's Sugar Hill studios.|$|E

60|$|Mary's {{face had}} been a little pale for her, I thought, as the wagon drew up; but it {{immediately}} became scarlet.

25|$|The same {{applies to}} other more complex biosignatures. Searching for {{biological}} {{remains of the}} precursors to life, whether ancient or currently existing, would be far easier on an uncontaminated planet. This would similarly apply to searches for DNA sequences on Mars.

60|$|The chief beckoned {{them down}} from the {{platform}} {{with a wave of}} his hand. They rose and followed him. As they rose the people around them bowed low to the ground.

Did they take the two strangers, then, for supernatural beings? Had they enrolled them <b>as</b> gods? <b>If</b> so, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> serve <b>as</b> some little protection for them.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Vimpany {{showed that}} he was acquainted with the formalities proper to the {{ceremony}} of tasting.

5000|$|In 2013 James {{moved to}} Munich and created 21 {{amorphous}} bronze sculptures on stands of shell limestone. Inspired by Robert Rauschenberg‘s Cardboard-series, the artist submerged and molded cardboard boxes in wax, {{in order to}} burn them afterwards and cast them in bronze. That way the processual and fragile moment of transition from solid to ash was captured and perpetuated. They look weightless, almost fragile, and yet, they are incredibly heavy and sturdy.' The works investigate the concept of mortality and recollection; they reflect the relationship between our present and the mythologies of the past. The title of the 2014 show [...] "Morphic Fields" [...] at Walter Storms Galerie refers to a quote by British biologist Rupert Sheldrake, who describes the process of transformation and the passing on of recollection in nature in his ‘hypothesis of formative causation’. The American author and art critic Glenn O'Brien said about James 'There’s a kind of oracular vibe about the work, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> staring at <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be good.’ ...|$|R
5000|$|The two {{examples}} of usage given above {{do not seem to}} show any sign that the expression [...] "temperament ordinaire" [...] (in its 17th-18th-century French usages) was anything more than a descriptive or denotative phrase, denoting whatever was to be referred to as [...] "the usual temperament": and the examples also make clear that other similar indicative words might equally be used instead, e.g. [...] "the common rule", or [...] "the one that everyone uses". Some of the modern literature might seem to apply [...] "temperament ordinaire" [...] <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is (or <b>might</b> have been, in the 17th or 18th centuries) a kind of proper name or conventional label of some particular tuning arrangement(s). Perhaps it is an open question whether this was ever so. The status that the phrase actually had at that time is relevant in turn to the substantive question of what actual tuning (or range of tunings) the phrase was then used to refer to. The examples above show, at least, that the temperament so referred to was not uniquely identified.|$|R
60|$|Ayala {{knew very}} well what the pony meant, as spoken of by the Colonel. When he {{declared}} that he regretted the pony, {{it was because the}} pony might have carried herself. He had meant her to understand that the much-thought-of ball or promised pleasure would have been the delight of again riding with herself. And then he had again called her Ayala. She could remember well every occasion on which he had addressed her by her Christian name. It had been but seldom. Once, however, it had occurred in the full flow of their early intimacy, before that love-making had been begun. It had struck her as being almost wrong, but still <b>as</b> very pleasant. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be made right by some feeling of brotherly friendship, how pleasant would it be! And now she would like <b>it</b> again, <b>if</b> only <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be taken as a sign of friendship rather than of love. It never occurred to her to be angry as she would have been angry with any other man. How she would have looked at Captain Batsby had he dared to call her Ayala! Colonel Stubbs should call her Ayala as long as he pleased,--if it were done only in friendship.|$|R
