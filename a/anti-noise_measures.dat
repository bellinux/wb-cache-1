40|$|Noise {{has been}} {{recognized}} as the air pollutant since it affects the environmental quality. Its effect depends on its level; it may be slightly uncomfortable or so annoying that hinder our business or in extreme cases dangerous to health. The project was focussed on measurements required to produce professional bases, {{in order to assess}} degree of exposure of individual sites (and their population) to different sources of noise to prepare an exact spatial presentation and a set of the most urgent and effective remedial action. The results of the study will also be used for: a) establishing <b>anti-noise</b> <b>measures</b> and b) the findings of the study and the data acquired will supplement cartographic base and conditions for land use (Municipal Spatial Plan) and determine the level of protection against noise, thus allowing more simple and authentic issuing of permits to applicants for further spatial use in the researched areas. The Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) Method enabled a presentation of the measured noise values. The results of this study will serve {{as a starting point for}} identification of critical areas with excessive noise level and to determine corrective action...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} {{structural}} vibration in cars, aeroplanes, ships, etc., {{is of great}} importance in achieving low noise targets. Currently, such control is effected using viscoelastic coating materials although much current research is concerned with active, <b>anti-noise</b> based control <b>measures.</b> This paper is concerned with a third approach: that of using advanced structural analysis methods and modern optimization techniques to produce designs with inherently superior vibration performance. It gives {{a brief review of}} a ten year programme of work, illustrating some of the difficulties that have been encountered and the progress that has been made. Central to this process has been the availability of a library of optimization techniques that can be readily applied to the problems of interest. In recent years this suite has been expanded to include a number of evolutionary computing methods such as the genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, evolutionary programming, etc. These have shown signi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Egnatia Motorway is a {{major highway}} project in Greece, {{one of the largest}} in Europe, cofunded by the European Union, {{completed}} within the last years, consisting one of the 14 TENT (Transportation European Network) priority projects. It is a 670 km modern motorway ensuring the communication link spanning Northern Greece from its western to its eastern border. For this project according to the 2002 / 49 /EU [1] directive the following tasks needs to be met: a) determination of exposure to environmental noise, through Strategic Noise Mapping (SNM), by methods of assessment common to the Member States; b) information on environmental noise and its effects should be made available to the public; c) adoption of noise action plans (NAP) by the Member States, in order to prevent and reduce environmental noise. At this end, EGNATIA ODOS S. A., in co-operation with the University of Thessaly (Department of Civil Engineers) & TT&E Consultants SA, within the last years, has implemented a comprehensive system of environmental management regarding the evaluation of the road noise & the needed mitigation measures during operation as per the above EU directive. Strategic noise maps (SNM) including noise action plans (NAP) and evaluation of the population's exposure to road traffic noise were executed for all the network sections of < 6. 000. 000 veh/year in proximity with urban settlements. Furthermore, extended scale noise monitoring program (more than 200 different locations) in independent time periods based on representative meteorological conditions of the northern Greece, were completed in order to calibrate the strategic noise model, and evaluate possible exceeding of the permitted noise limits specifying therefore the need of immediate adequate <b>anti-noise</b> mitigation <b>measures</b> (i. e. road traffic noise barriers). The results of this program and the relevant SNM's are presented in this article along with exposure analysis of the inhabitants of the nearby urban settlements to the noise descriptors Lden & Lnight...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Ten years ago, {{the first}} Spanish high speed line which {{traveled}} from Madrid to Sevilla {{at an average}} speed of 250 km/h was inaugurated. At this speed pantograph noise, which is of an aerodynamic nature, {{is thought to have}} rather influence in the passengers zone. However, pantograph contribution is often omitted since main noise sources are expected to come from wheels and devices placed under the floor (motors, engines, compressors, etc). According to this, special anti-noise treatments are designed for floor structures achieving high noise insulation levels. Then, not expected noise contributions from the pantograph become significant. This paper is aimed at evaluating whether is necessary to apply <b>anti-noise</b> <b>measures</b> on the roof structure or not, by using the vibro-acoustical description of all car’s elements, and the measured pantograph sound power level as the inputs of a SEA model. Firstly, two microphone arrays had been used for the measurement, one of them having optimum microphone spacing to achieve best resolution at low frequency octave bands, and the other one to get best performance at high frequency octave bands, covering a global range of frequencies between 500 Hz and 4000 Hz. And finally, SEA model revealed the need of reinforcing roof insulation. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is - {{with the aid of}} cost benefit analysis - evaluate economic impacts of planned amendment to Regulation of the Government No. 148 / 2006 Coll. On Health Protection from Adverse Effects of Noise and Vibration, namely based on the case of specific road track. Amendment to Regulation is aimed at making existing noise limits softer (to increase them) and thus to bring about savings in investment cost connected with <b>anti-noise</b> <b>measures.</b> The thesis intends to use a single case study to find out whether benefits resulting from price reduction in the process of road construction are higher than costs in the form of decrease of welfare caused by the higher noise exposition; alternatively at what period savings in costs connected with road construction equal to decrease in welfare (savings in costs are one-off, while increase in noise exposition and related drop in welfare are long-term). Estimated changes in welfare are based on analysis of secondary sources [...] first of all on the study of traffic externalities in the Czech republic conducted by contingent valuation method. The actual core of the thesis is cost benefit analysis. Attention is paid also to broader discussion on experience in providing exceptions from noise limits in the Czech Republic...|$|E
40|$|A growing {{attention}} {{has been devoted to}} acoustical problems on board of ships, particularly in connection with the recent, extensive production of high standard cruise vessels. Severe specifications on the maximum noise levels in the various areas of the ship and in particular in the living and working areas are now common. This brought the need, since the first steps of the design, for a careful acoustical planning, based on a detailed analysis of the various elements of the “acoustic circuit”. This approach implies in general to consider sources on board (power and location), transmission paths and receiving positions. The work concentrates on the final part of the transmission path and regards the <b>anti-noise</b> <b>measures</b> that are utilised for the cabin walls (particularly on the floor) to reduce the noise radiated inside the room. Such measures have been applied since a long time by the shipyards, but mostly with empirical methods, based on a trial-and-error procedure. The aim of the present work is to summarise the physical concepts that are at the bases of the noise counter-measures and to review the physical quantities {{that can be used to}} quantify their effectiveness. The case of the application of viscoelastic materials in a constrained layer arrangement to the cabin floor is discussed in particular, with a description of the main material and geometrical parameters and an evaluation of their influence on the performance of the treatment. A description is included of a simplified procedure for a comparative testing of different viscoelastic materials and of some results of this procedure...|$|E
40|$|In Europe the {{contents}} of Noise Action Plans of road networks are established by the Directive 2002 / 49 /EC. In Italy another plan, the Noise Abatement Plan, is required by the national legislation, in particular by the Decree of the Ministry of the Environment of 29 / 11 / 2000. The procedures for the definition of both plans are quite similar and {{are based on the}} realization of noise maps. This paper analyses the effects of different methodologies used for noise mapping on the outcomes of the noise abatement plan of the road network managed by the Province of Terni in Italy. The road selected as case study is a single carriageway road that is 50 km long and passes nearby several sensitive receivers such as schools and hospitals. Four different methodologies were employed and the outcomes analysed. In particular in the first methodology a regular grid is used for calculations (Grid Noise Maps- GNM), while in the other ones the noise levels are evaluated at 1 meter from each building façade (Façade Noise maps – FNM). Moreover the latter three methodologies differ one from the other by the selection of the number and the position of the calculation points. The first two methodologies are in compliance with the Italian legislation while the other two are improvements developed and tested by the Authors that allow more realistic and accurate estimates of noise impact on the receivers. Usually the main outcome of an Italian noise abatement plan is the ranking of the buildings/areas that most urgently require mitigation and the definition of the <b>anti-noise</b> <b>measures</b> to be realized. The study shows how the different procedures affect these results and influence the activities of the managing authorities in the realization of the mitigation measures...|$|E
