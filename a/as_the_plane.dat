5|$|At the {{airfield}} in the morning, Curt says goodbye to his parents, his sister Laurie, Steve, John and The Toad. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> takes off, Curt, gazing {{out of the}} window, sees the white Ford Thunderbird belonging to the mysterious blonde driving down a country road.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{reported}} that <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> approached Detroit, Abdulmutallab {{went into the}} plane's lavatory for about 20 minutes. After returning to his seat at 19A (near the fuel tanks and wing, and against {{the skin of the}} plane), he complained that he had an upset stomach. He was seen pulling a blanket over himself.|$|E

50|$|Francisco's captors {{immediately}} {{came under}} attack by U.S. warplanes during rescue efforts. The North Vietnamese troops jumped into a protective trench, leaving the disabled Francisco fatally exposed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> dropped cluster bombs on the area.|$|R
5|$|Carpender was not inflexible, {{and reached}} a {{compromise}} with Mackay to transport a battalion to Finschhafen in high speed transports (APDs). Herring was in Dobodura, lunching with Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell, {{when he heard}} this news. He decided to fly to Milne Bay {{to discuss the matter}} of resupply in general with Barbey. On 28 September, Herring and two of his staff officers, Brigadiers R. B. Sutherland and R. Bierwirth, boarded a U.S. Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell bomber at Dobodura. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> was about to take off, the undercarriage collapsed and the plane ploughed into the Marston Mat runway. A propeller shattered, splinters ripped through the fuselage into the cabin and Sutherland, who was sitting in the navigator's compartment next to Herring, was struck by a flying fragment that killed him instantly. The crew, Herring and Bierwirth escaped shaken but unscathed. The trip to Milne Bay was cancelled. Brigadier Sutherland was buried with full military honours at Soputa the next day, with a fly past by B-25s. When next he flew, Herring once again took a B-25 and made a point of requesting the major who had been in charge of the crashed plane to be his pilot.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> did {{not perform}} noticeably better than {{conventional}} aircraft designs, the Regia Aeronautica decided to cancel further development. No further prototypes were built.|$|E
25|$|On 6 September 1970, El Al Flight 219 {{experienced}} an attempted hijack by two PFLP members. One hijacker {{was killed and}} the other was subdued <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> made an emergency landing at Heathrow Airport.|$|E
5000|$|The Airspeed AS.57 Ambassador was a British twin piston-engined {{airliner}} {{that first}} flew on 10 July 1947 {{and served in}} small numbers through the 1950s and 1960s. <b>The</b> <b>planes</b> are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Elizabethans", as they were originally ordered and popularized by British European Airways <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> used for their [...] "Elizabethan Class" [...] passenger service.|$|R
5000|$|British Prime Minister David Cameron and {{officials}} in the U.S. believe that the bombs were designed to detonate <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> were in flight, destroying <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> in mid-air. Britain's Home Secretary, Theresa May, said British investigators concluded the U.K. device was a functional bomb powerful enough {{to bring down the}} aircraft, causing a [...] "supersonic blast". Brennan agreed with this assessment.|$|R

25|$|At about 6:00p.m. EST, Air Force One {{arrived at}} Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, D.C. The {{television}} networks made {{the switch to}} the AFB just <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> touched down. Reporting the arrival for the TV networks were Richard Bate (ABC), Charles Von Fremd (CBS), and Bob Abernethy & Nancy Dickerson (NBC).|$|E
25|$|Flight TE-901 {{took off}} on 29 November 1979. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> descended to {{sightseeing}} altitude upon reaching Antarctica, the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) went off seemingly out of nowhere. The flight crew barely {{had a chance to}} react before TE-901 slammed into the side of Mount Erebus, killing everyone on board.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> descended through clouds, the captain's {{attention}} {{was drawn to}} the artificial horizon which displayed excessive bank and pitch. Because such an attitude is highly irregular, the captain incorrectly assumed the indicators to be faulty. Without any visual references (due to the clouds) and having rejected the information from the ADIs, the captain and first officer became spatially disoriented.|$|E

5000|$|The {{airport was}} {{established}} by Richard A. Newhouse (original spelling Neuhaus). Among his other aviation-related projects, in 1911 he built a plane of his own design, featuring separate floating ailerons [...] - [...] a major innovation, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> of that time used wing warping for roll control.|$|R
25|$|The lone {{survivor}} of the crash claimed that a crocodile hidden in a duffel bag had escaped. The frightened passengers then moved towards {{the front of the}} aircraft away from the crocodile. This affected the aircraft weight and balance leading to a loss of control. The crocodile escaped <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> approached its destination. The crocodile reportedly survived the crash but was killed by a blow from a machete.|$|E
25|$|December 25, 2009, Nigerian {{national}} Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab {{attempted to}} detonate an explosive device on Northwest Airlines Flight 253, an Airbus A330 from Amsterdam to Detroit <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> was approaching Detroit. The device failed {{to go off}} correctly, and the suspect suffered burns to his lower body. Three other passengers had minor injuries. The White House said it considered the incident an attempted terrorist attack.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{calculations}} for {{the near}} field can be done using the Fresnel diffraction equation. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> of observation gets closer to the plane in which the slits are located, the diffraction patterns associated with each slit decrease in size, so that {{the area in which}} interference occurs is reduced, and may vanish altogether when there is no overlap in the two diffracted patterns.|$|E

25|$|The {{homogeneous}} Poisson {{process on}} the real line {{is considered one of}} the simplest stochastic processes for counting random numbers of points. This process can be generalized in a number of ways. One possible generalization is to extend the distribution of interarrival times from the exponential distribution to other distributions, which introduces the stochastic process known as a renewal process. Another generalization is to define the Poisson point process on higher dimensional spaces such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
25|$|Intuitively, then, the {{stereographic}} projection {{is a way}} of picturing the sphere <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane,</b> with some inevitable compromises. Because the sphere and the plane appear in many areas of mathematics and its applications, so does the {{stereographic projection}}; it finds use in diverse fields including complex analysis, cartography, geology, and photography. In practice, the projection is carried out by computer or by hand using a special kind of graph paper called a stereographic net, shortened to stereonet, or Wulff net.|$|E
50|$|Desargues's theorem {{holds for}} {{projective}} space of any dimension over any field or division ring, and also holds for abstract projective spaces of dimension at least 3.

Visual meteorological conditions were present <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> made its final approach to runway 9 at Mayagüez on May 8, 1987. 600 feet short of the runway, the plane crashed, destroying the aircraft and killing both pilots, but leaving the four passengers with only minor injuries.|$|E
25|$|At 5:00 pm EST, 15-year-old Charlie J. Bishop's {{instructor}} {{left him}} at the plane to perform a preflight inspection. Once he was left alone in the plane, he started the engine and took off without permission. As soon <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> took off, the air traffic controllers alerted the United States Coast Guard and the MacDill Air Force Base. Despite repeated warnings from a helicopter dispatched by the Coast Guard, the small plane continued on until it collided with an office building. The plane crashed between the 28th and 29th floors of the 42-story building.|$|E
25|$|Sullenberger had ditched near {{boats to}} {{facilitate}} rescue. NY Waterway ferries Thomas Jefferson and then Governor Thomas H.
