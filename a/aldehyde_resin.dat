Organic silicon epoxy resin and phenolic <b>aldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> are applied as film forming matters to get a series of ablative coating having a density of 0. 4 - 0. 6 g/cm 3. The performance of the low density ablative coating is evaluated by mechanical, thermodynamic and oxygen acetylene ablation tests, and the results are as follows, adhesion is in the range of 2. 97 - 4. 63 MPa, conductivity is no more than 0. 1 kcal/(m·h· °C), line ablation rate is no more than 0. 30 mm/s, mass ablation rate is in the range of 0. 11 - 0. 18 mm/s...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} structure of three low-molecular weight resins used as paint varnishes {{has been characterized}} by use of an approach based on three different mass spectrometric techniques. We investigated the ketone resin MS 2 A, the <b>aldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> Laropal A 81, and the hydrocarbon resin Regalrez 1094, now commonly used in restoration. To date, the {{molecular structure}}s of these resins have not been completely elucidated. To improve current knowledge of the chemical composition of these materials, information obtained by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS), pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py/GC/MS), and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI–Q–ToF) was combined. Analysis, in solution, of the whole polymeric fraction of the resins by flow-injection ESI–Q–ToF, and of the non-polymeric fraction by GC/MS, enabled us to identify previously unreported features of the polymer structures. In addition, the Py–GC/MS profiles that we obtained will help to enhance the databases currently available in the literature. The proposed approach can be extended to other low-molecular-weight resins used as varnishes in conservation...|$|E
40|$|Considering the {{tremendous}} complexity {{and the wide}} dynamic range of protein samples from biological origin and their proteolytic peptide mixtures, proteomics largely requires simplification strategies. One common approach to reduce sample complexity is to target a particular amino acid in proteins or peptides, such as cysteine (Cys), with chemical tags {{in order to reduce}} the analysis to a subset of the whole proteome. The present work describes the synthesis and the use of two new cysteinyl tags, so-called cysteine-reactive covalent capture tags (C 3 T), for the isolation of Cys-containing peptides. These bifunctional molecules were specifically designed to react with cysteines through iodoacetyl and acryloyl moieties and permit efficient selection of the tagged peptides. To do so, a thioproline was chosen as the isolating group to form, after a deprotection/activation step, a thiazolidine with an <b>aldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> by the covalent capture (CC) method. The applicability of the enrichment strategy was demonstrated on small synthetic peptides as well as on peptides derived from digested proteins. Mass spectrometric (MS) analysis and tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) sequencing confirmed the efficient and straightforward selection of the cysteine-containing peptides. The combination of C 3 T and CC methods provides an effective alternative to reduce sample complexity and access low abundance proteins...|$|E
40|$|The {{reactions}} between naphthol and formaldehyde {{as well as}} furfural {{were carried}} out in different solutions. The pH medium of the reaction mixture was varied in preparation of Naphthol <b>Aldehyde</b> (NA) <b>resin</b> to study their influence on the structure and Fluorescence of the NA resin. The spectrofluorometry {{was found to be}} a successful and informative analytical tool to study individual naphthol and <b>aldehyde</b> <b>resins.</b> Naphthol, naphthol formaldehyde and naphthol furfural resins were prepared by the addition of formaldehyde or furfural to naphthol either in basic medium of 10 % NaOH, or in acidic medium. The physical properties of prepared compounds were already assigned in previous studies. Fluorescence spectra for the prepared compounds as well as formaldehyde and naphthol were investigated. Excitation and emission wave lengths for each compound were nearly identical but they showed a transfer toward ultraviolet region for basic formaldehyde resin at nearly 474 - 475 nm due to the increasing the aliphatic groups –(-CH 2 OH). While those for basic naphthol furfural resins were transferred toward the visible region at nearly 680 nm due to the increasing resonance in the aromatic groups...|$|R
30|$|The {{detection}} of heptanal is possibly {{due to the}} presence of <b>aldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> in the binder mixes [10]. In the same way, the presence of alkyd resins could be at the origin of the {{detection of}} adipic acid [11 – 14]. Nevertheless, the Aerodur 5000 reference sample differs from the Akzo 683 - 3 - 7 samples (pigmented and unpigmented) through the absence of acrylic resin and the presence of bisphenol A (BPA), which is a characteristic compound of epoxy resins [6, 15]. BPA epoxy resins can be used as co-reactants due {{to the presence of}} hydroxyl groups, which are cross-linked with isocyanates. On the other hand, the use of polyisocyanates cross-linked with epoxy resins, which have secondary hydroxyl groups, is a way of improving exterior durability of PU coatings.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to develop a method for identification of compounds emitted during thermal degradation of binders used in foundry. Research were performed with the use of Certified Reference Materials mixtures of semi-volatiles compounds with furfuryl alcohol and <b>aldehyde.</b> Furfuryl-urea <b>resin</b> samples were also used. Station for thermal degradation of materials used in foundry was designed and made. Thermal degradation process conditions and gas chromatograph coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry operating conditions were established. Organic compounds emitted during degradation were identified. The paper briefly represents the range of study and the results obtained for furfuryl-urea resin thermal degradation. Significant information about volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds emitted in different temperatures is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{monitoring}} of performance characteristics of resins {{was always an}} issue for the conservation community, since {{the stability of the}} art objects depends on the service life of conservation materials used. Among the resins commonly applied in the field of paintings conservation, four of the most popular ones, Paraloid B 72, Primal AC 33 (acrylic polymers), Ketone Resin N (cyclohexanone) and Laropal A 81 (ureaaldehyde) were selected to be comparatively studied under accelerated ageing conditions. These resins have been used by the art conservators either as consolidant materials of the paint or as protecting varnishes for the painting surface. The behaviour of the coatings under thermal ageing was investigated following a methodology depositing films of all materials onto different solid substrates (silicon wafers, quartz and simple glass slides) depending on the method of analysis used. Accelerated thermal ageing tests were conducted at 100 oC, for up to 432 hours. The morphological characteristics of the resins films (crack formations and surface alterations, coherence of film layers, thickness and surface roughness) were examined through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Chemical changes of the resins were studied with FTIR and UV-Vis spectroscopy, while colour properties and thermal-chemical stability were also studied with spectrocolorimetry. It was found that, although all four displayed changes concerning their colour and film thickness, the two acrylic polymers and the <b>aldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> exhibit high stability against chemical degradation compared to the cyclohexanone based resin. Complementary solubility and swelling testing were also applied and significantly aided in supporting the spectroscopy observations. Finally, microscopic examination of most resin films revealed cracking features which may sometimes render them unsuitable for application under uncontrollable conditions...|$|E
40|$|Carboxylic acids were {{converted}} in high yield to their 1, 1 -dimethylallyl (DMA) esters in two steps. Palladium-catalyzed deprotection of DMA esters {{shown to be}} compatible with tert-butyl, benzyl and Fmoc protecting groups, and Fmoc deprotection {{can be carried out}} selectively in the presence of DMA esters. DMA esters were shown to be resistant to nucleophilic attack, suggesting that they can serve as alternatives to tert-butyl esters when acidic deprotection conditions need to be avoided. ^ An efficient method for one pot regioselective synthesis of 1, 1 -dimethylallyl esters of different amino acids has been demonstrated. This method is quick, cheap and provides DMA esters for a number of amino acids in a good yield. Dimethylallyl esters of various carboxylic acids have been synthesized using prenyldimethylsulfonium tetrafluroborate, a reagent that can be readily made and stored, in conjunction with CuCl. Protection of the carboxylic acids was complete within several hours and afforded the esters in high yields. ^ Toward the synthesis of callipeltin B, the desired (3 S, 4 R) - 3, 4 -dimethyl-L-pyroglutamic acid was synthesized on a large scale (3 ̆e 2 g) and the toxic Jones reagent was replaced by a new oxidation procedure using catalytic amount of Ruthenium trichloride to afford a cleaner reaction. Attempted synthesis of pure cis isomer by hydrogenation of an exomethylene compound obtained by the method using Eschenmoser 2 ̆ 7 s salt resulted in a mixture of cis and trans isomer. ^ A strategy for the solid phase synthesis of a cyclosporin A analogue has been studied. BAL linker was used for the on resin synthesis of cyclosporin A analogue. Dimethylallyl (DMA) ester was employed as the protecting group for the C-terminal of amino acid. The attachment of the first amino acid as its dimethylallyl (DMA) ester to the <b>aldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> was performed by on-resin reductive amination. The peptide chain assembly was performed by incorporation of the amino acid residues as their N-Fmoc derivatives due to their orthogonality with DMA ester. ...|$|E
40|$|Using polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) 1, {{a commercially}} {{available}} free flowing liquid, {{the formation of}} crosslinked polymers 3 using a crosslinker 2 {{and a variety of}} catalysts such as Wilkinson's, TBAF and diethylhydroxylamine to aid this process are reported. The application of these polymers to the reduction of acetophenone is also discussed. Secondly, crosslinked PMHS resins incorporating DMAP 4 and pyridine derivatives 5 were developed as scavengers. Both resins were found to successfully scavenge benzyl bromide. Studies using various substrates are discussed along with resin compositions giving indications of loading. The resins were found to be active towards benzyl halides and cinnamyl halides. A comparison is also made between the resins made in house and those available commercially. <b>Aldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> 6 were also developed to scavenge amines. This was found to be successful in scavenging benzylamine and other amine derivatives. An in situ method to scavenge aldehydes is also described. Using the substrate and the scavenging hydrazine 7 in solution, crosslinked PMHS was then used to remove the imine intermediate 8 successfully from solution. Finally, studies were performed using an in situ polymerisation method to scavenge for alcohols 9 and other substrates from solution along with a 3 component scavenging study. PMHS was used to successfully scavenge various alcohols from 1 : 1 standard solutions in the presence of 1, 4 -benzenedimethanol 2 and diethylhydroxylamine catalyst giving species such as 11.

40|$|Section I: Novel bicyclic {{thiazolidine}} lactams were synthesized from Fmoc acetal Merrifield resins {{to demonstrate}} a new synthetic procedure permitting {{the use of a}} wide range of functionality and an expanded scope of traditional solid-phase organic and peptide chemistry. The Fmoc acetal resins, which play a pivotal role as versatile intermediates, were prepared, N-deprotected, and subsequently acylated with ozone-incompatible groups such as furanyl and alkenyl. Although the N-acylated acetal resins can be directly converted to bicyclic thiazolidine lactams by reaction with substituted cysteine dertivatives at elevated temperatures, it has been demonstrated that initial hydrolysis of the acetal <b>resins</b> to the <b>aldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> using 35 : 60 : 5 trifluoroacetic acid:dichloro-methane:water before treatment with amino thiols led to the subsequent use of considerably milder cyclitive cleavage conditions. In all cases cyclitive cleavage using cysteine derivatives afforded two major diastereomers which were separated by normal or reverse-phase (C 18) preparative HPLC. The stereoisomers were fully characterized spectroscopically (1 HNMR, 13 CNMR, DEPT 90 / 135, HSQC, COSY, HMBC) and relative stereochemistry was determined using 1 -D nOe difference spectroscopy and 2 -D NOESY. ^ Section II: Trifluoroacetic acid-mediated cleavage of Rink resin-bound N-acylated amino acid amides afforded mixtures of primary amides and their carboxylic acid hydrolysis products. The majority of the hydrolysis occurred post-cleavage in solution. The rate of hydrolysis was sensitive to the electronic substituent effects of the acyl group and amide susceptibility to hydrolysis can be predicted from the substituent 2 ̆ 7 s Hammett sigma value. The rate-enhancing substituent effect of the p-methoxy group was nullified or retained by carbonyl group insulation or conjugation, respectively. The effect was also observed with acyl groups R 2 CO (R 2 = alkyl) and followed the trend whereby the rate of hydrolysis increased proceeding from primary to secondary to tertiary alkyl. Hydrolysis was completely suppressed by use of cleavage cocktails containing 65...|$|R
40|$|In the {{ethylene}} glycol generation unit of petrochemical plants, first a reaction of ethylene oxide takes place {{which is then}} followed by other side reactions. These reactions include water absorption with ethylene oxide, {{which leads to the}} generation of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. Over the lifetime of the alpha-alumina-based silver catalyst there is an increase in side reactions, increasing the amount of the formaldehyde and acetaldehyde generated by the ethylene oxide reactor which leads to reduced MEG product purity. Given the need of a petrochemical complex to further strip the aldehyde (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) to increase the quality of the MEG and increase the lifetime of the alpha-alumina-based silver catalyst, resin beds are designed and their surface absorption capacity is investigated to optimize aldehyde (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) removal in the recirculating water flow of the ethylene oxide unit. Experiments show that the ion exchange system based on strong anionic resin pre-treated with a sodium bisulfite solution can reduce the aldehyde level from about 300 ppm to less than 5 ppm. After the resin is saturated with <b>aldehyde,</b> the <b>resin</b> can be recycled using the sodium bisulfite solution which is a cheap chemical substance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMüller cells play a {{critical}} role in retinal metabolism and are among the first cells to demonstrate metabolic changes in retinal stress or disease. The timing, extent, regulation, and impacts of these changes are not yet known. We evaluated metabolic phenotypes of Müller cells in the degenerating retina. Retinas harvested from wild-type (WT) and rhodopsin Tg P 347 L rabbits were fixed in mixed <b>aldehydes</b> and <b>resin</b> embedded for computational molecular phenotyping (CMP). CMP facilitates small molecule fingerprinting of every cell in the retina, allowing evaluation of metabolite levels in single cells. CMP revealed signature variations in metabolite levels across Müller cells from TgP 347 L retina. In brief, neighboring Müller cells demonstrated variability in taurine, glutamate, glutamine, glutathione, glutamine synthetase (GS), and CRALBP. This variability showed no correlation across metabolites, implying the changes are functionally chaotic rather than simply heterogeneous. The inability of any clustering algorithm to classify Müller cell as a single class in the TgP 347 L retina is a formal proof of metabolic variability in the present in degenerating retina. Although retinal degeneration is certainly the trigger, Müller cell metabolic alterations are not a coherent response to the microenvironment. And while GS is believed to be the primary enzyme responsible for the conversion of glutamate to glutamine in the retina, alternative pathways appear to be unmasked in degenerating retina. Somehow, long term remodeling involves loss of Müller cell coordination and identity, which has negative implications for therapeutic interventions that target neurons alone...|$|R
40|$|Slow {{oxidative}} (SO) fibers of the adductor longus (AL) {{were predominantly}} damaged during voluntary reloading of hindlimb unloaded (HU) rats and appeared explainable by preferential SO fiber recruitment. The present study assessed damage after eliminating the variable of voluntary recruitment by tetanically activating all fibers in situ through the motor nerve while applying eccentric (lengthening) or isometric contractions. Muscles were <b>aldehyde</b> fixed and <b>resin</b> embedded, and semithin sections were cut. Sarcomere lesions were quantified in toluidine blue-stained sections. Fibers were typed in serial sections immunostained with antifast myosin and antitotal myosin (which highlights slow fibers). Both isometric and eccentric paradigms caused fatigue. Lesions occurred only in eccentrically contracted control and HU muscles. Fatigue {{did not cause}} lesions. HU increased damage because lesioned- fiber percentages within fiber types and lesion sizes were greater than control. Fast oxidative glycolytic (FOG) fibers were predominantly damaged. In no case did damaged SO fibers predominate. Thus, when FOG, SO, and hybrid fibers are actively lengthened in chronically unloaded muscle, FOG fibers are intrinsically more susceptible to damage than SO fibers. Damaged hybrid-fiber proportions ranged between these extremes...|$|R
30|$|The Py-GC/MS {{study of}} 2 KSBPU, 2 KWBPU, 1 KWBPU and FPU {{reference}} samples pointed out very different compositions for equivalent products and allowed determining marker compounds reliable for {{the identification of}} specific PU systems. The pyrograms obtained for two package PU systems systematically exhibit a peak identifying HDI monomer. Inversely no diisocyanate monomers {{were found in the}} pyrograms produced for the one package waterborne PU references. Most of the investigated PU coatings are based on binder mixes involving styrene, acrylate, methacrylate and phthalic anhydride polyester resins in various proportions. Acrylic monomeric species primarily identified are nBA and nBMA. Characteristic decomposition products of <b>aldehyde</b> and silicone <b>resins,</b> resulting from pyrolysis were detected in several references. A dominant peak of 2 -ethylhexan- 1 -ol characterizes the pyrograms recorded for the 2 KWBPU samples. In PU industry, this alcohol is widely used as blocking agent in the preparation of polyisocyanate resins offering waterborne coatings with high stability. For this reason, the detection of high 2 -ethylhexan- 1 -ol content might be considered as an indicator of 2 KWBPU systems. Concerning the FPU samples, the produced pyrograms similarly display a dominant peak of 2 -methylcyclopentanone and a smaller peak of cyclohexanol. The concomitant presence of these two peaks appeared as a characteristic feature of the FPU pyrograms. As a result, the join presence of 2 -methylcyclopentanone and cyclohexanol provides a reliable criterion for the identification of FPU coatings.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} described herein {{involves the}} study of new approaches to alkenation and pinacol cross-coupling. The competition between modified Julia alkenation and Peterson alkenation was studied. Heterocyclic sulfides were oxidised to sulfones by dimethyldioxirane. Reactions between sulfones and aldehydes gave vinyl sulfones in good yields, rather than vinyl silanes, confirming that the Peterson alkenation is preferred in this system. Pinacol cross-coupling between an aldehyde or ketone in solution and a more easily reduced <b>aldehyde</b> immobilised on <b>resin</b> was attempted, but proved unsuccessful. However, aldehydes bearing the salts of tertiary amines {{were found to be}} good substrates for pinacol homo-coupling giving diols. The formation of salt avoided unwanted reduction of the aldehyde to a primary alcohol. A wide range of approaches to anisomycin using titanium reagents were investigated. These were based on the formation of the bond between C- 3 and C- 4 by alkylidenation of esters and ring-closing metathesis (RCM) or intramolecular alkylidenation or radical cyclization. The presence and position of the nitrogen atom proved an insurmountable obstacle to this strategy. The solid-phase synthesis of 4 -amino-ketones was achieved. Resin-bound esters were alkylidenated using a novel titanium reagent generated in situ by reduction of a thioacetal with a low valent titanium reagent. Treating the resulting enol ethers with acid gave ketones in good yield and high purity because of the switch {{in the nature of the}} linker from acid-stable to acid-sensitive (a chameleon catch strategy).
