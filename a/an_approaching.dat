5|$|Another passive marking form is {{the word}} {{ambulance}} (or local language variant) spelled out in reverse {{on the front of}} the vehicle. This enables drivers of other vehicles to more easily identify <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> ambulance in their rear view mirrors. Ambulances may display the name of their owner or operator, and an emergency telephone number for the ambulance service.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{other factors}} such as ease of {{understanding}} and communicating the results of <b>an</b> <b>approach,</b> ease of use of <b>an</b> <b>approach,</b> and cost of introduction of <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> {{should be considered in}} a selection process.|$|R
50|$|This {{ability to}} address {{marginal}} readings {{is something that}} <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> combining linear order and rank can accomplish, whereas <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> that acknowledges only c-command cannot do the same.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of algorithms for the terrain visibility problem. First, a comprehensive background {{of the problem is}} given. It is explained how the 2, 5 D problem is transformed to a 1, 5 D problem. Next, six algorithms (<b>a</b> naive <b>approach,</b> <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> with the height of line-of-sight (LOS), <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> with the biggest slope of LOS, <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> with the cross product, <b>an</b> incremental <b>approach,</b> and <b>an</b> improved incremental <b>approach)</b> are briefly explained and their theoretical time complexities are given. After that, run-times of the algorithms are measured for different terrain configurations and different viewpoint heights. The best algorithm is selected at the end...|$|R
5|$|Beryl {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about}} 18hours as it paralleled the Mid-Atlantic and New Jersey coasts, during which an eye-like feature {{developed in the}} center of the convection. Late on July 20, it began a slow weakening trend after passing over cooler waters. Steering winds ahead of <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> mid-level trough caused Beryl to accelerate northeastward, and early on July 21 the center of the storm crossed the island of Nantucket. The convection diminished as it moved through progressively colder waters, and shortly after 1200UTC on July 21 Beryl became an extratropical cyclone a short distance east of Cape Cod. Hours later, it made landfall in southwestern Nova Scotia, and on July 22 the extratropical remnants of Beryl merged with <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> cold front over Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Leif Hoste, Peter Van Petegem and Vladimir Gusev were disqualified for riding {{through a}} closed train {{crossing}} 10km before the finish and {{just ahead of}} <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> freight train. Fabian Cancellara won and Tom Boonen and Alessandro Ballan were given the remaining places on the podium.|$|E
5|$|On October 31, {{the storm}} {{moved across the}} Mississippi Delta near Burrwood, Louisiana, and {{accelerated}} to the northeast, influenced by <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> upper-level trough. At 1200 UTC that day, Juan attained a secondary peak of 70 mph (110 km/h). In the subsequent six hours, the storm weakened slightly, making its final landfall just west of Pensacola, Florida with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) late on October 31. After striking Florida, Juan turned {{to the north and}} weakened over land. After moving through Alabama, the storm became extratropical over Tennessee on November 1. Although the Atlantic hurricane best track ceased tracking the circulation at 1800 UTC that day, Juan continued generally northward through the Ohio Valley, and the center eventually crossed into Canada. The energy from Juan helped spawn an occluded low in the Tennessee Valley, which produced more rainfall throughout the region. <b>An</b> <b>approaching</b> cold front absorbed the remnants of Juan on November 3.|$|E
30|$|Because wooden {{materials}} {{are composed of}} complicated microstructures, <b>a</b> microscopic <b>approach</b> is preferable to investigate their electroelastic properties in detail, and investigations from such <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> were actually made for elastic [9, 10], dielectric [11, 12], and piezoelectric [13] properties. In the design procedures of engineering applications, however, such <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> requires <b>a</b> considerably high computational cost and is not practical. Therefore, <b>a</b> macroscopic <b>approach</b> is required.|$|R

5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression One {{formed on}} May 25 from a weak low {{pressure}} area {{to the west of}} Jamaica, which had been producing scattered showers over the island during the preceding days. The depression moved across Cuba shortly after forming, although the convection was located to the east of its poorly defined center. As it headed toward Florida, it was absorbed by <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> cold front.|$|E
5|$|While at peak intensity, Jery began {{turning to}} the south, due to {{reaching}} {{the western edge of}} a ridge. <b>An</b> <b>approaching</b> trough increased wind shear over the storm, causing the convection to diminish and expose the center. Late on April10 it weakened below tropical cyclone status, and the next day Jery became extratropical. Shortly thereafter the remnants crossed into the Australian region, dissipating on April13.|$|E
50|$|This {{approach}} {{can be seen as}} one of the two basic approaches to problem solving, contrasted with <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> using insight and theory. However, there are intermediate methods which for example, use theory to guide the method, <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> known as guided empiricism.|$|R

5|$|After {{affecting}} Yap, Mitag {{turned to}} the northwest and later to the north due to <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> trough. It passed {{to the north of}} Palau, contributing to one death there. Despite predictions of weakening, the typhoon continued to intensify, reaching peak winds of 175km/h (110mph 10minute sustained) on March5. The combination of cooler air and interaction with the westerlies caused Mitag to weaken significantly. Only four days after reaching peak winds, the storm had dissipated well to the east of the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|After exiting Cuba {{into the}} Gulf of Mexico, the {{hurricane}} weakened greatly. On October20 it passed {{a short distance}} west of Key West, Florida, and very early on October21 the hurricane moved over Marco Island with winds of 90mph (150km/h). The cyclone weakened further as it turned eastward through the state, deteriorating to tropical storm status as it passed near or over Miami. It accelerated east-northeastward, moving over the Abaco Islands in The Bahamas. Gradually weakening, the storm interacted with <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> cold front; late on October23 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and shortly thereafter it was absorbed by the front.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, they filmed scenes {{set in the}} Amazon jungle in Hilo, Hawaii until August. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was {{the biggest}} film shot in Hawaii since Waterworld, and was {{estimated}} to generate US$22 million to $45 million in the local economy. Because of <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> hurricane, Spielberg was unable to shoot a fight at a waterfall, so he sent the second unit to film shots of Brazil's and Argentina's Iguazu Falls. These were digitally combined into the fight, which was shot at the Universal backlot.|$|E

50|$|Methodological {{skepticism}} {{is distinguished}} from philosophical skepticism in that methodological skepticism is <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> that subjects all knowledge claims to scrutiny {{with the goal}} of sorting out true from false claims, whereas philosophical skepticism is <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> that questions the possibility of certain knowledge.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the winds}} rapidly {{decreased}} after landfall, the storm maintained a well-defined structure as it crossed from Mozambique into Zimbabwe late on February22. Weakening to tropical depression status, Eline crossed Zimbabwe and maintained its circulation, entering Botswana on February24. Three days later, the center drifted into eastern Namibia {{and turned to}} the south, dissipating on February29. After the circulation dissipated, the residual system merged with a heat low and <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> cold front.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Inigo {{was tied}} with Cyclone Gwenda for being the most intense {{recorded}} cyclone in the Australian region in terms of pressure. It developed from a tropical low that crossed eastern Indonesia in late March 2003. Becoming a named tropical cyclone on 1 April, Inigo rapidly intensified as it tracked southwestward, reaching a minimum central pressure of 900hPa on 4 April. <b>An</b> <b>approaching</b> trough weakened the cyclone and turned it to the southeast, and on 8 April Inigo dissipated after making landfall on Western Australia as a minimal tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|Dust {{kicked up}} by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the {{darkness}} of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly the sound of <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> tornado, serve as any warning {{to those in the}} storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.|$|E

5|$|Further, young giraffes {{are much}} more {{vulnerable}} to predation than adults: between 60% and 75% of calves die within a year. Mothers hide their calves, which spend {{much of the time}} lying down in cover. Since the presence of a mother does not affect survival, Mitchell suggests that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged. This is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited. Conversely, far from hiding, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves even from lions.|$|E
5|$|Gandalf reappears to warn all of <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men and elves band together, {{but only}} with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn do they win the climactic Battle of Five Armies. Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies. Bilbo accepts {{only a small portion}} of his share of the treasure, having no want or need for more, but still returns home a very wealthy hobbit.|$|E
5|$|Hermes was berthed in Trincomalee on 8 April when {{a warning}} of <b>an</b> <b>approaching</b> Japanese fleet was received, and she sailed that {{day for the}} Maldives with no {{aircraft}} on board. On 9 April a Japanese scout plane spotted her near Batticaloa, and she was attacked by several dozen dive bombers shortly afterwards. With no air cover, the carrier was quickly sunk by the Japanese aircraft. Most of the survivors were rescued by a nearby hospital ship, although 307 men from Hermes {{were lost in the}} sinking.|$|E
