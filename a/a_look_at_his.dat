5|$|Betances died at 10:00a.m., local time, in Neuilly-sur-Seine on Friday, September 16, 1898. His {{remains were}} cremated soon after and entombed at the Père Lachaise Cemetery of Paris on Monday, September 19. He had {{requested}} that no formal ceremony {{be made for}} his funeral. His common law-wife Simplicia survived him for over 20 years. <b>A</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> will implies that, besides a life insurance policy payout and two parcels {{of land in the}} Dominican Republic, Betances died almost in poverty.|$|E
5|$|Martin next awakes in Doggett's home. Wells tells Doggett the {{description}} of the killer but the man isn’t in lock-up yet because that won’t happen until Wednesday. Doggett and Wells arrive at the apartment and retrieve the nanny cam, but discover that someone disabled the cam and used its remote control, a device no one knew about except Mr. and Mrs. Wells and their nanny, Trina Galvez. At Trina Galvez’s home, Wells and Doggett discover the killer, a man named Cesar Ocampo, who threatened to kill Galvez's family if she refused him entrance. At the station house, Doggett informs Wells that Ocampo only wants to talk to him. Ocampo reveals that his brother, Hector, was sentenced to time in prison for a false conviction. Wells bargains with Cesar Ocampo, saying that if Cesar confesses to Vicky’s murder, he will take <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> brother’s case. Cesar tells him that Hector hung himself in a jail cell a few weeks ago. Doggett calls Martin Wells out into the hall and the police arrest Martin because they have a case against him. Evidence against Ocampo isn’t strong enough yet.|$|E
25|$|During {{a workout}} with Barry Bonds in 2001, a cream {{was applied to}} Sheffield's knee by a trainer to help heal ripped {{stitches}} from a knee surgery. Sheffield states in his book, Inside Power, {{that he had no}} knowledge of the cream containing steroids, and had no reason to assume so at the time. He goes on to say in his book that the cream did nothing to strengthen his knee, and also states that <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> numbers shows no improvement after the incident.|$|E

25|$|Champions of Meucci, Manzetti, and Gray {{have each}} offered fairly precise tales of a {{contrivance}} whereby Bell actively stole {{the invention of}} the telephone from their specific inventor. In the 2002 congressional resolution, it was inaccurately noted that Bell worked in a laboratory in which Meucci's materials had been stored, and claimed that Bell must thus have had access to those materials. Manzetti claimed that Bell visited him and examined his device in 1865. And it is alleged that Bell bribed a patent examiner, Zenas Wilber, not only into processing his application before Gray's, but allowing <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> rival's designs before final submission.|$|E
500|$|McKinley, {{with the}} {{exception}} of his 1893 financial crisis, had avoided scandal and carefully guarded his image, making him difficult to attack. [...] Hanna proved an easier target. Although Davenport had depicted Hanna in his cartoons before the Republican convention in June, these efforts were uninspired. This changed once Davenport got <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> subject while attending the 1896 Republican National Convention in St. Louis. After three days spent closely observing Hanna managing the convention to secure McKinley's nomination and passage of a platform supporting the gold standard, Davenport was impressed with Hanna's dynamic behavior. [...] Convinced that he could effectively lampoon Hanna, Davenport's cartoons became more effective. Hanna was a tall man; Davenport exaggerated this trait, in part by shrinking everybody else. He also increased Hanna's already substantial girth. [...] Hanna's short sideburns were lengthened and made rougher—Davenport described them as [...] "like an unplaned cedar board". [...] Davenport borrowed from the animal kingdom for his creation, drawing Hanna's ears so they stuck out like a monkey's. [...] The cartoonist described Hanna's eyes as like a parrot's, leaving no movement unseen, or as those of a circus elephant—scanning the street for peanuts.|$|E
