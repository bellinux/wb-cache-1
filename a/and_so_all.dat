5|$|Of the 56 riders that {{signed up}} to {{participate}} in the 1912 Giro d'Italia, 54 of them began the race on 19 May. Since the race's general classification was to be based around team points there were no independent riders as in years past. The organizers allowed the participating teams to have up to four riders, with each team needing three riders to finish each stage to remain in the race. There were a total of fourteen teams that started the 1912 Giro d'Italia. A French team was planning on competing in the race, but opted not to <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>all</b> the teams that competed were based in Italy. This edition of the Giro d'Italia saw the first teams enter the race that were not sponsored by a bicycle related industry.|$|E

25|$|Today, navel oranges {{continue}} to be propagated through cutting and grafting.

25|$|In 1771, an {{incident}} {{on the field}} of play {{led to the creation of}} a new Law which remains extant. In a match between Chertsey and Hambledon at Laleham Burway, the Chertsey all-rounder Thomas White used a bat that was the width of the wicket. There was no rule in place to prevent this action <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>all</b> the Hambledon players could do was register a formal protest which was signed by Thomas Brett, Richard Nyren and John Small, the three leading Hambledon players. As a result, it was decided by the game's lawmakers that the maximum width of the bat must be four and one quarter inches; this was included in the next revision of the Laws and it remains the maximum width.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Jude Law {{arrived at}} the very end of shooting, on 2 April, to film the Imaginarium ladders sequence, which now {{required}} more dialogue than originally planned; a key scene in the Imaginarium wagon between Tony and the rest of the cast had been reserved for the Vancouver interior shooting, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>all</b> of the dialogue (and, thus, narrative role of that scene) had to be funnelled into a conversation between Law and Andrew Garfield's characters in the Imaginarium. This conversation proved to be the last sequence shot for the film, and involved a set completely improvised, on the day, to look like the ground at Battersea; they did not have the budget for anything better, but the production crew came away quite impressed at how well it worked.|$|E
25|$|After {{the retreat}} from Nashville, the six small regiments {{were sent to}} North Carolina where they fought one more battle, the Battle of Bentonville, on 19 March 1865. On the same day General Lee {{surrendered}} in Virginia, April 9, 1865, Johnston reorganized his army. The Western Florida Brigade was consolidated and their six regiments were put into a single unit, being the last form of the 1st Florida Infantry Regiment. Under command of Lt. Col. Mashburn the 1st Florida marched in Brigadier James A. Smith's brigade in the division of General John C. Brown, who was their brigade commander at Perryville. When Johnston surrendered at Bennett Place on April 26 the 1st Florida, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>all</b> Floridian units in the Army of Tennessee, had fewer than 200 men present and fit for duty (with just over 400 total). The troops were paroled on May 1, 1865.|$|E

25|$|Loathing was {{specifically}} {{built around the}} Myth engine and allowed the team to modify the 3D landscape, apply lighting, determine terrain type, script the AI, and position structures, scenery, and enemies. The artists used PowerAnimator on an SGI Indigo 2 to create polygonal models and render all the characters. The 3D models were imported into the game using Fear, while the 2D sprites were cleaned up in Adobe Photoshop and imported and animated using Extractor. To create the texture maps for the terrain, the artists used Photoshop to draw the equivalent of an aerial photo, and then applied it to the 3D landscape using Loathing. Initially, the developers had planned on using fractal-generated landscapes, but they felt the randomness of such landscapes would {{make it difficult to}} design interesting levels, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>all</b> maps were instead constructed by hand.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} war effort, an {{explosives}} factory, ROF Bridgwater, {{was built}} at Puriton. The Catchment Board needed to be able to guarantee that 4.5 million gallons (20.5 Megalitres) of process water would be available to the factory every day. To this end, the Huntspill River was constructed, a little further to the north, which was essentially a revival of a plan by J. Aubrey Clark in 1853, to provide better drainage for the Brue valley. King's Sedgemoor drain was deemed to be a backup source for water, should the Huntspill scheme fail, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>all</b> of the work which had been planned before the war started was completed, to ensure that the volume of water needed was always available. Greylake sluice was built by the Somerset Rivers Catchment Board in 1942, and used guillotine gates to control water levels. The original plaque commemorating its completion was incorporated into the new structure when the sluice was rebuilt in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The Hatherton Canal {{was built}} in two phases by two {{separate}} canal companies, {{over a period of}} some 20 years. The first part to be constructed ran from Hatherton Junction at Calf Heath on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal to Churchbridge, and was built as a branch of the main canal by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Company. There had been proposals for a tramway following a similar route in 1798, to link to collieries owned by a Mr. Vernon near Wyrley. Plans for the tramway were borrowed by the canal company, and formed the basis for surveys in 1826 and 1830, but the branch as built followed a somewhat different route, and was surveyed in 1837. Unusually, an Act of Parliament was not obtained for the work, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>all</b> land required for the project had to be bought by agreement with the landowners. Negotiations were completed by 4 April 1839, at which point the company accepted an estimate of £12,345 from Robert Frost, and construction began. This phase was completed in April 1841, and a tramway from the terminus to Great Wyrley, which was used to transport coal, was completed the following year. Both the canal and the tramway were financed out of income, as the canal company was very profitable at the time, paying dividends to shareholders which had exceeded 25 per cent for over thirty years. The branch was called the Hatherton Branch after the company chairman, Lord Hatherton.|$|E

[...] Their departure left only one remaining group of Mexican soldiers in Texas, those under General Cos at Béxar. [...] The Texians now controlled the Gulf Coast, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>all</b> communication between Cos and the Mexican interior must be transferred overland.

But the ships were found to be not worth rebuilding a second time, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>all</b> were ultimately decommissioned in 1909. Aziziye, Orhaniye, and Mahmudiye were briefly used as barracks ships; the latter two were sold for scrap in 1913, and Aziziye and Osmaniye followed them to the ship breakers in 1923.|$|E
