5|$|The Brazil Parure {{is one of}} {{the newest}} items of {{jewellery}} in the collection. In 1953, the president and people of Brazil presented Elizabeth II with the coronation gift of a necklace and matching pendant earrings of aquamarines and diamonds. It had taken the jewellers Mappin & Webb an entire year to collect the perfectly matched stones. The necklace has nine large oblong aquamarines with an even bigger <b>aquamarine</b> pendant drop. The Queen had the drop set in a more decorative diamond cluster and it is now detachable. She was so delighted with the gift that in 1957 she had a tiara made to match the necklace. The tiara is surmounted by three vertically set aquamarines. Seeing that the Queen had so liked the original Coronation gift that she had a matching tiara made, the Government of Brazil decided to add to its gift, and in 1958 it presented Elizabeth II with a bracelet of oblong aquamarines set in a cluster of diamonds, and a square <b>aquamarine</b> and diamond brooch.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. It {{is a relatively}} rare element in the universe, usually occurring {{as a product of}} the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused and creates larger elements. It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl (<b>aquamarine,</b> emerald) and chrysoberyl. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal.|$|E
5|$|This {{franchise}} includes illustrated novels starring {{the various}} princesses, {{two of which}} are about Ariel: The Birthday Surprise and The Shimmering Star Necklace. Both novels are written by Gail Herman, and contain original stories about Ariel's life as a human and Eric's wife, but still maintaining close relationships with her father and sisters under the sea. The franchise also includes illustrated short stories about Ariel's life as a human, such as Ariel and the <b>Aquamarine</b> Jewel, Ariel's Dolphin Adventure, and Ariel's Royal Wedding. Ariel also appears as a supporting character in one volume of the Japanese manga Kilala Princess, where she is seen in her pre-movie mermaid form.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aquamarine</b> (from , being, water : sea, i.e. sea water, marīna, from marīnus; of the sea.) is a blue or cyan {{variety of}} beryl. It occurs at most localities which yield {{ordinary}} beryl. The gem-gravel placer deposits of Sri Lanka contain <b>aquamarine.</b> Green-yellow beryl, {{such as that}} occurring in Brazil, is sometimes called chrysolite <b>aquamarine.</b> The deep blue version of <b>aquamarine</b> is called maxixe. Maxixe is commonly found {{in the country of}} Madagascar. Its color fades to white when exposed to sunlight or is subjected to heat treatment, though the color returns with irradiation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Beryl, Be 3 Al 2 (SiO 3) 6, is {{a natural}} {{gemstone}} with many colors. Some of these colors can be induced or modified by exposure to ionizing radiation, by heating, and maybe by electrodiffusion. Small contents of chromophore chemical elements {{are related to the}} colors of beryl, like iron, chromium, vanadium, manganese, and others. There is great interest in relation to methods of improving or inducing colors in beryl. There is evidence that infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) can contribute to foresee beryl behavior submitted to procedures for color change. It was observed that electrodiffusion with or without contaminant ions did not alter the FTIR spectrum of <b>aquamarines,</b> unlike heat treatment. Green samples have a higher content of type I water molecules, whereas blue samples have a higher content of type II water molecules. Significant changes in FTIR spectra of <b>aquamarines</b> were observed only in green samples after exposure to gamma rays or to heat. The vanishing of the band at 3633 cm- 1 {{may be related to the}} position of Na+ ion in the crystal lattice of beryl...|$|R
25|$|The {{pale blue}} color of <b>aquamarine</b> is {{attributed}} to Fe2+. Fe3+ ions produce golden-yellow color, and when both Fe2+ and Fe3+ are present, the color is a darker blue as in maxixe. Decoloration of maxixe by light or heat thus {{may be due to}} the charge transfer between Fe3+ and Fe2+. Dark-blue maxixe color can be produced in green, pink or yellow beryl by irradiating it with high-energy particles (gamma rays, neutrons or even X-rays).|$|E

Teitur continued to tour extensively in over 20 countries, building a firm following and respect amongst media and the musician community, {{despite the lack of}} commercial marketing by Universal Records.|$|E
25|$|The building's facade {{was covered}} with {{continuous}} glass windows along with alternating azure and <b>aquamarine</b> porcelain spandrels. The colorful design was a popular way to add color to otherwise bland urban skylines of the mid-twentieth century. The ground floor, containing the main entrance on Ervay, was covered in granite and recessed to provide extra sidewalk width for street level retail space; the second floor was covered in mosaics. Opened in 1958 as a general office building, it was popular with insurance companies, law firms, and aviation-related companies.|$|E
50|$|All {{the pieces}} in the {{collection}} are unique items, and the combination of materials, dimensions and shapes used by Salvador Dalí make this a one-off set in which the artist managed to express in a unique way the wealth of his singular iconography. Gold, platinum, precious stones (diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, <b>aquamarines,</b> topazes, etc.), pearls, corals and other noble materials combine to form hearts, lips, eyes, plant and animal forms, religious and mythological symbols and anthropomorphic forms.|$|R
50|$|Madagascar is the world's leading {{producer}} many colored gemstones, including: sapphires, rubies, multi-coloured tourmalines, emerald, amethysts, cordierites, <b>aquamarines</b> and garnets. Madagascar {{is also a}} major source of graphite, making it the second-largest producer in Africa. Additionally, Madagascar is the Africa's third {{leading producer}} of chromite. Titanium oxide is found in significant quantities in beach sands located near Toalagnaro, however, 75% of the coastal forest zone in that area would have to be destroyed in order to exploit it, which has not been done.|$|R
50|$|The United States Department of Labor estimated, in its 2010 report, about 33% of Zambian {{children}} aged 5-14 work. Agriculture {{is the dominant}} employer, and with mining employs 98% of all child labour in Zambia. The informal sectors witnessing the worst form of child labour include cotton plantations, tobacco, fishing, tea, coffee and charcoal. Child labour is common in mining. However, this is witnessed in small artisanal and traditional mines, where the children extract emeralds, amethyst, <b>aquamarines,</b> tourmalines and garnets. Child labour is also present in mines of lead, zinc and copper ores. They do not wear any protective equipment to protect their eyes or face or body; injuries are common.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{blue-footed booby}} preys on fish by diving headlong into the water, its {{nostrils}} are permanently closed, {{and it has}} to breathe through the corners of its mouth. Its most notable characteristic is its blue-colored feet, which can range in color from a pale turquoise to a deep <b>aquamarine.</b> Males and younger birds have lighter feet than females. Its blue feet {{play a key role in}} courtship rituals and breeding, with the male visually displaying its feet to attract mates during the breeding season.|$|E
25|$|Most floats are {{shades of}} green {{because that is the}} color of glass from {{recycled}} sake bottles (especially after long exposure to sunlight). However, clear, amber, <b>aquamarine,</b> amethyst, blue and other colors were also produced. The most prized and rare color is a red or cranberry hue. These were expensive to make because gold was used to produce the color. Other brilliant tones such as emerald green, cobalt blue, purple, yellow and orange were primarily made in the 1920s and 30s. The majority of the colored floats available for sale today are replicas.|$|E
25|$|Referencing {{a passage}} from Canadian poet Anne Carson’s book ‘Plainwater’, Untitled (“Consider incompleteness as a verb.”) (2010–12) is {{composed}} of two large glass cubes, which are matte on the sides with a smooth, glossed surface, resembling freshly cut blocks of ice. The cubes are made from a two-colour glass which reflect their surroundings. Each piece is a subtly different shade of blue and, {{depending on the type}} of light in the gallery, the time of day, and the weather outside, these shades shift from violet to lavender to <b>aquamarine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pope Paul's tiara was {{distinctive}} in {{many ways}} and may be generally characterised in the Art Deco style prevalent during the 1930s and 1940s. As with some other papal tiaras, {{it was made of}} a solid silver exterior over a felt lay. Unlike other tiaras, it was almost totally devoid of jewels, carvings or any intense ornamentations, with the three crowns represented by three rings that ran around the tiara, on which sat a handful of small jewels in isolation, in addition to the <b>aquamarines</b> set {{in the center of each}} of the fleur-de-lis which made up the gold circlet at the base of the tiara, giving it a simplistic modern style.|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} {{absorption spectra}} of Fe^(2 +) in non-chromium beryls are examined. Fe^(2 +) in the Al-rich six-coordinate site produces absorption bands at about 820 nm and 970 nm polarized EIIc. Fe^(2 +) in the channel produces bands at 820 nm (⊥c) and 2100 nm (IIc). Some blue beryls {{which are more}} intensely colored than most <b>aquamarines,</b> have an absorption band at ∼ 700 nm (‖c) which is suggested to arise from an Fe^(2 +) /Fe^(3 +) intervalence interaction. Fe^(2 +) in both the six-coordinate site and the channel is identified in the Mössbauer spectra. The Mössbauer spectra of deep blue beryls are unusual and have not been satisfactorily explained. Color changes which accompany heating and irradiation are strongly influenced by the channel iron...|$|R
