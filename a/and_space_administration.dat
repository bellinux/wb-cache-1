40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the National Aeronautics <b>and</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Administrations</b> (NASA) {{state of the}} art of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) for additive manufacturing (AM), or " 3 -D printed", hardware. NASA's unique need for highly customized spacecraft and instrumentation is suited for AM, which offers a compelling alternative to traditional subtractive manufacturing approaches. The Agency has an opportunity to push the envelope on how this technology is used in zero gravity, an enable in-space manufacturing of flight spares and replacement hardware crucial for long-duration, manned missions to Mars. The Agency is leveraging AM technology developed internally and by industry, academia, and other government agencies for its unique needs. Recent technical interchange meetings and workshops attended by NASA have identified NDE as a universal need for all aspects of additive manufacturing. The impact of NDE on AM is cross cutting and spans materials, processing quality assurance, testing and modeling disciplines. Appropriate NDE methods are needed before, during, and after the AM production process...|$|R
5|$|Originally {{proposed}} in 1965, {{the station was}} established by the Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (NTNF) in 1967 in close cooperation with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (NDRE) and located adjacent to Tromsø Geophysical Observatory. From its inception until 1974, it served low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operated by the European Space Research Organization (ESRO). To a lesser extent it was also used by Canadian Space Agency and National Aeronautics <b>and</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Administration</b> (NASA) LEO satellites. Norway's non-membership in ESRO and later the European Space Agency (ESA) caused Tromsø to not become a ground station for Landsat. A gradual increase in operations occurred from 1982, such as for the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme and the European Remote-Sensing Satellite. TSS became part of NSC in 1990, although it was partially sold to the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) in 1995. SvalSat merged with TSS in 2002 to form KSAT.|$|E
5|$|The {{exploration}} of Jupiter {{has been conducted}} via close observations by automated spacecraft. It began {{with the arrival of}} Pioneer 10 into the Jovian system in 1973, and, , has continued with eight further spacecraft missions. All of these missions were undertaken by the National Aeronautics <b>and</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Administration</b> (NASA), and all but two have been flybys that take detailed observations without the probe landing or entering orbit. These probes make Jupiter the most visited of the Solar System's outer planets as all missions to the outer Solar System have used Jupiter flybys to reduce fuel requirements and travel time. On 5 July 2016, spacecraft Juno arrived and entered the planet's orbit—the second craft ever to do so. Sending a craft to Jupiter entails many technical difficulties, especially due to the probes' large fuel requirements and the effects of the planet's harsh radiation environment.|$|E

The pilot would also {{be sent to the}} Naval Air Development Center in Johnsville, Pennsylvania, and would be subjected to high g-forces in a centrifuge for comparison with data collected in the simulator. His request for the position was granted, and he spent several days at Langley and a week in Johnsville for the testing.

30|$|Battlefield {{situation}} {{is the major}} resource for pilots {{to learn about the}} flight status data, task information as well as threat and security state information. Pilots must grasp distinct, real and complete information of combat situation, so that to have the initiative to the battlefield in hands.

However, multi-level information contents may cause visual interference, which will result on pilots’ wrong perception about the information at digital display interface. For example, a pilot may not be able to precisely capture the target due to misunderstanding when guide probability of the acquisition missile capture in radar situation-interface and thus bungle the chance of winning a battle. European and North American National Aeronautics, <b>and</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Administrations</b> have conducted lots of experimental studies on improving the naturalness and effectiveness of man–machine interactions in the pilot cockpit (Mark [1]; Heather et al.
