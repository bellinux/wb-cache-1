25|$|After he {{attained}} arhatship, {{he began}} to think deeply of his parents, <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> happened to them. He used his clairvoyance to see where they were reborn and found his father in the heavenly realms i.e. {{the realm of the}} gods. However, his mother had been reborn in a lower realm, known as Avīci, or the Realm of Hungry Ghosts. His mother took on the form of a hungry ghost (preta)– so called because it could not eat due to its highly thin and fragile throat in which no food could pass through, yet it was always hungry because it had a fat belly. His mother had been greedy with the money he left her. He had instructed her to kindly host any Buddhist monks that ever came her way, but instead she withheld her kindness and her money. It was for this reason she was reborn in the realm of hungry ghosts.|$|E
500|$|Perry was {{inspired}} to write the episode upon wondering whether the internet, about which he had only heard positive remarks, had a [...] "dark side". He was shown Jennifer Ringley's JenniCam [...] website, which provided a constant webcam view of her daily life, <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> sort of investigations would arise if a murder were witnessed on a similar broadcast. The other main inspiration for the episode was the real-life Zodiac Killer, who {{formed the basis for}} the fictional Avatar. Perry's script was later given a [...] "polish" [...] by executive producer James Wong, with Perry stating that roughly ninety percent of the material is his own work. Several women in the episode, including possible murder victims investigated by Black and Roedecker, are named after Perry's sisters.|$|E

2500|$|Even if it took {{a century}} and a half for many of the book's virtues to be realised, enough was {{recognised}} at the time to make the book one of Hazlitt's most successful.

2500|$|McCreight {{began his}} lifelong kinship with Native Americans in Devils Lake. The {{first people to}} meet and greet him as he {{stepped down from the}} {{platform}} of the train were a small band of Sioux. [...] "They were a fine healthy lot; and as the travel-worn youth with his carpet-bag and lunch basket looked about for someone from whom he might ask directions, the Chief stepped up and with extended hand, said: [...] "How cola!" [...] Half in fright and with a puzzled hand-shake, the boy made his way toward what seemed to be the white man's town. [...] He passed by a large pile of bones, <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> it meant. It was not many days until he was informed, for soon he found himself in full charge of the business of buying and shipping buffalo bones including the very pile which had so aroused his curiosity on arrival in the far west; for this was Indian and buffalo country then, but it proved to be the end for both shortly thereafter. It was the last year for the buffalo; and it was the last year of the happy, healthy, life for the Indians. Indians had killed his great-grandfather and carried on a war of extermination against his forebears in Pennsylvania in the old days. That kindly greeting by the old Sioux Chief quickly dispelled much of the prejudice that had filled his heart through childhood, and soon the youth began to think that Indians were not such terrible folks as Eastern people believed they were.” ...|$|E
