5|$|Mission {{objectives}} vary {{in quantity}} and length {{depending on the}} difficulty setting chosen. Difficulty settings also affect enemy accuracy and damage, {{and the availability of}} the game's optional <b>automatic</b> <b>aiming</b> assistance. The player can use several weapons, including pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, and a rocket launcher. Weapons must be reloaded after a certain number of shots and have alternate fire modes. For example, the Wolfram P2K can be used with or without a silencer. In addition, the player always carries a wristwatch which may be used to stun enemies, fire tranquilizer darts, throw a grappling hook, or emit a laser beam to open locks. In some missions, the player can also use night vision or X-ray vision glasses to outsmart enemies. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. There are no health-recovery items in the game, although body armors can be acquired to provide a secondary health bar. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak is required to save the player's progress through the game.|$|E
25|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>aiming</b> is also {{applied to}} the shot, which may (especially in lower difficulties) cause the cannonballs to be fired at a {{narrower}} angle to the ship's heading. This <b>automatic</b> <b>aiming</b> attempts {{to take into account}} the heading and speed of the enemy ship, and often will cause a more accurate hit, although it can also be detrimental, especially against quick enemies. Cannon facing the enemy are fired in volleys. After firing, the crew begins to reload, a task which takes a certain amount of time depending on the number of cannon, the number of crew, and several other factors. Volleys can be fired even when not all cannon have been loaded, as opposed to a broadside. The largest broadside possible (24 guns) is fired by a fully armed Ship of the Line, which mounts 48 guns in total. Such a volley is often wide enough to hit the enemy regardless of his attempts to maneuver out of the way. The player needs {{to take into account the}} enemy's heading and speed when firing, as cannonballs take some time to travel the distance between the two ships and therefore cannot be fired directly at the enemy's position unless the enemy is motionless or at extremely close range.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, {{his work}} on the <b>automatic</b> <b>aiming</b> and firing of {{anti-aircraft}} guns caused Wiener to investigate information theory independently of Claude Shannon and to invent the Wiener filter. (To him is due the now standard practice of modeling an information source as a random process—in other words, as a variety of noise.) His anti-aircraft work eventually led him to formulate cybernetics. After the war, his fame helped MIT to recruit a research team in cognitive science, composed of researchers in neuropsychology and the mathematics and biophysics of the nervous system, including Warren Sturgis McCulloch and Walter Pitts. These men later made pioneering contributions to computer science and artificial intelligence. Soon after the group was formed, Wiener suddenly ended all contact with its members, mystifying his colleagues. This emotionally traumatized Walter Pitts, and led to his career decline. In their biography of Wiener, Conway and Siegelman suggest that Wiener's wife Margaret, who detested McCulloch's bohemian lifestyle, engineered the breach.|$|E

A friend then flew his light plane around the area while the camera periodically took photographs, and on 31 May the system was able to accurately track the aircraft. Work then started on making the system suitable for field use, mounting the entire system in a single trailer with the 6-foot antenna on top.

Kai also has special moves against enemies and bosses, such as chaining the enemy to the wall/floor or mounting and delivering a powerful blow to a boss. His alternate weapon is a mechanical crossbow known as the Cross Gun, greatly increasing his rate of fire and grants him access to explosive weaponry, but sacrifices evasiveness and has less abilities.|$|E

40|$|The {{heliostat}} field of solar central receiver systems (SCRS) is formed by hundreds, even thousands, of working heliostats. Their adequate configuration and control define a currently active research line. For instance, <b>automatic</b> <b>aiming</b> methodologies of existing {{heliostat field}}s are being widely studied. In general, control techniques require {{a model of}} the system to be controlled in order to obtain an estimation of its states. However, this kind of information may not be available or may be hard to obtain for every plant to be studied. In this work, an innovative methodology for data-based analytical heliostat field characterization is proposed and described. It formalizes {{the way in which the}} behavior of a whole field can be derived from the study of its more descriptive parts. By successfully applying this procedure, the instantaneous behavior of a field could be expressed by a reduced set of expressions that can be seen as a field descriptor. It is not intended to replace real experimentation but to enhance researchers’ autonomy to build their own reliable and portable synthetic datasets at preliminary stages of their work. The methodology proposed in this paper is successfully applied to a virtual field. Only 30 heliostats out of 541 were studied to characterize the whole field. For the validation set, the average difference in power between the flux maps directly fitted from the measured information and the estimated ones is only of 0. 67 % (just 0. 10946 kW/m 2 of root-mean-square error, on average, between them). According to these results, a consistent field descriptor can be built by applying the proposed methodology, which is hence ready for use...|$|E

Similar products already exist in other sports like football, tennis and baseball. For throwing the ball the machine uses 2 motors that rotate two wheels. The distance between the wheels enable the ball too pass through but just by so much so the wheels get in contact with the ball and can accelerate it. The project has been done in the Umeå University’s facilities with access to workshop and school programs and computers. The system is controlled by a Raspberry PI model 3 and the programing is done in Codesys.  The tests that were made achieved the requirements and will be seen as successful. The test and evaluations have also been done in the schools facilities. Ideas and inspirations have come from other similar products for other purposes such as tennis, baseball and football. The tests have been evaluated for possible changes and improvements. The project is a first prototype and its purpose is to find functions and possibilities and not build a product. ...|$|R
