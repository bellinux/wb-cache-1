5|$|The unusually low {{metallicity}} of Vega {{makes it}} a weak Lambda Boötis-type star. However, {{the reason for the}} existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear.

5|$|A unique {{feature of}} {{architecture}} of ancient Sri Lanka, vatadages were {{built for the}} protection of small stupas that had an important relic enshrined in them or were built on hallowed ground. If the Polonnaruwa Vatadage is the shrine built by Parakramabahu I, the relic of the tooth of the Buddha would have been enshrined within it. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the alms bowl used by the Buddha may have been enshrined here.

5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Lǫgmaðr regained {{some form}} of control in the Isles {{following}} Magnús' death, and afterwards joined Sigurðr's expedition to Holy Land {{in the first decade}} of the twelfth century. Whether Sigurðr's undertaking was a planned crusade per se, or merely an eventful and violent pilgrimage, is debatable. The precise chronology of this enterprise is similarly uncertain, although the Norwegian fleet certainly reached England before the end of the first decade of the twelfth century. It may have been at this point, whilst Sigurðr overwintered at the English royal court, that Lǫgmaðr joined up with him. If Lǫgmaðr and Sigurðr indeed rendezvoused in England, this may have been the time when Óláfr, the future King of the Isles, was entrusted to the safekeeping of the English king.|$|E
5|$|Most TBI {{that results}} from blunt trauma occurs within the chest. The most common {{tracheal}} injury is a tear near the carina or in the membranous wall of the trachea. In blunt chest trauma, TBI occurs within 2.5cm of the carina 40–80% of the time. The injury {{is more common in}} the right main bronchus than the left, possibly because the former is near vertebrae, which may injure it. Also, the aorta and other tissues in the mid chest that surround the left main bronchus may protect it. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people with left main bronchus injuries are more likely to also have other deadly injuries and therefore die before reaching hospital, making them less likely to be included in studies that determine rates of injuries.|$|E

50|$|The {{place of}} Luo's birth and date are a {{controversial}} question.

50|$|Interestingly, {{the site}} {{contained}} two large ditches, one that stretched from Lake Yojoa to a pool {{just north of}} an encampment, made during the Jaral phase. The second ditch was probably constructed during the Eden phase. The purpose of the ditches is disputed, however {{there is evidence to}} support the idea <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> probably used as a defense mechanism. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> filled with water, however the bedrock {{at the bottom of the}} ditches is seemingly too porous for a water well.|$|R
5|$|Odaenathus was {{described}} as Roman senator in the undated tomb inscription and Hairan I was mentioned with the same title in the 251 inscription. Scholarly opinions vary on the exact date of Odaenathus' elevation to the position; Gawlikowski and Jean Starcky maintain that the senatorial rank predates the Ras elevation. Udo Hartmann concludes that Odaenathus first became a Ras in the 240s then a senator in 250. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the senatorial rank and lordship occurred simultaneously; Odaenathus was chosen as a Ras following Gordian's death, then after Philip the Arab concluded a peace with the Persians, the emperor ratified Odaenathus' lordship and admitted him to the senate to guarantee Palmyra's continuous subordination.|$|E
5|$|The {{chronology}} {{and circumstances}} surrounding the conclusion of Lǫgmaðr's reign are uncertain. According to one source, he voluntarily resigned the kingship and journeyed to Jerusalem where he died. This account could be evidence that he died on crusade: one possibility is the First Crusade, perhaps in the entourage of Robert II, Duke of Normandy; another possibility is the so-called Norwegian Crusade, in the entourage of Sigurðr Magnússon, King of Norway. Although one source claims that Lǫgmaðr's trek to the Holy Land was undertaken in remorse for the cruelty he had inflicted upon Haraldr, <b>another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he was forced into exile instead.

5|$|This shark's {{behavior}} and social structure {{is not well}} understood. In South Africa, white sharks have a dominance hierarchy depending on the size, sex and squatter's rights: Females dominate males, larger sharks dominate smaller sharks, and residents dominate newcomers. When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks. This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another, they react with a warning bite. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> white sharks bite to show their dominance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reasons are}} not clear, though there <b>are</b> three <b>possibilities.</b> The Fulton County Night Riders {{justified}} their murders because David Walker had swore [...] "at a white woman". An other possible reason <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Walker {{had a bad}} reputation, and was a [...] "surly negro". <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> David Walker's neighbor wanted to take his 21 1/2 acres of land from him. After David Walker was killed, his adjacent neighbor absorbed Walker's property into his own. The neighbor sold it to another man, whose daughter owns the undeveloped property today.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the reading}} of the three-pointer {{altimeter}} was misinterpreted. This type of altimeter has individual pointers for thousands, hundreds and tens of feet, and can be difficult to interpret. Errors of 1,000 or 10,000 feet were common, as had been outlined by W. F. Grether in a 1949 report for the Journal of Applied Psychology. As a consequence, three-pointer altimeters were later removed from service. If human error were the case, the accident may have simply been the result of a controlled flight into terrain. However, many commentators thought this unlikely, given the long experience of Captain Pollard.|$|R
25|$|Although {{both the}} Dunedin and Marlborough were sighted in the Southern Ocean after leaving New Zealand, neither were seen again. No trace was found of the Dunedin {{and it was}} presumed both she and the Marlborough hit icebergs in the Southern Ocean. RMS Rimutaka had {{reported}} <b>that</b> there <b>were</b> great quantities of ice in the Southern Ocean on their normal route between the Chatham Island and Cape Horn when she sailed through the area in early to mid February. The Board of Enquiry concluded that apart from hitting an iceberg <b>another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Dunedin had come to grief in a storm.

5|$|While other spies such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Klaus Fuchs {{were caught}} after the war, Koval {{apparently}} went unscrutinized for years. Among the reasons given for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper security checks on employees. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies. In the 1950s, the FBI investigated his wartime activities and interviewed his former colleagues, leaving {{them with the}} impression that he might have been a spy. The matter was kept confidential for sixty years as the US was afraid of the damage that would result from the exposure of Koval's activities.|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach {{was the son}} of a {{man named}} Ragnall. Whilst Echmarcach bore a Gaelic name, the name of his father is {{ultimately}} derived from Old Norse, a fact that serves to exemplify the hybrid nature of the eleventh-century Irish Sea region, The identity of Echmarcach's father is uncertain. One possibility is that Ragnall was a member of the dynasty that ruled the Norse-Gaelic enclave of Waterford in tenth- and eleventh centuries. If so, Echmarcach may have been the son of one of two Waterfordian rulers: Ragnall mac Ímair, King of Waterford (died 1018), or this man's apparent son, Ragnall ua Ímair, King of Waterford (died 1035). <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Echmarcach belonged to a family from the Isles, and that his father was Ragnall mac Gofraid, King of the Isles (died 1004/1005), son and possible successor of Gofraid mac Arailt, King of the Isles (died 989). As a descendant of either of the aforesaid families, Echmarcach would appear to have been a member of the Uí Ímair, a royal dynasty descended from the Scandinavian sea-king Ímar (died c.873).|$|E
5|$|Some scutes {{contain a}} single pore {{known as an}} {{integumentary}} sense organ. Crocodiles and gharials have these on large parts of their bodies, while alligators and caimans only have them on the head. Their exact function is not fully understood, {{but it has been}} suggested that they may be mechanosensory organs. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they may produce an oily secretion that prevents mud from adhering to the skin. There are prominent paired integumentary glands in skin folds on the throat, and others in the side walls of the cloaca. Various functions for these have been suggested. They may play a part in communication, as indirect evidence suggest that they secrete pheromones used in courtship or nesting. The skin of crocodilians is tough and can withstand damage from conspecifics, and the immune system is effective enough to heal wounds within a few days.|$|E

5|$|The {{lands and}} offices of Urse's brother Robert were divided between Beauchamp and Robert Marmion. Marmion and Beauchamp {{disagreed}} about {{the division of}} the lands, leading to a long dispute between the two families that was only settled in the late 12th century.

Because there are no contemporary sources showing that Urse had any children besides his son and the daughter who married Beauchamp, <b>another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Urse's brother Robert had a daughter who married Marmion, and that Urse managed to acquire part of her inheritance on the strength of his friendship with King William II of England.|$|E
5|$|The {{maker of}} the work is unknown; it is not signed or marked, and goldsmiths of the period rarely did this. There are a number of goldsmiths' names known from {{accounts}} and other records, but none of the few surviving works can be attached to a particular maker. Paris was the centre of production for the great numbers of joyaux, secular and religious, produced for the extended Valois royal family and other buyers. Berry and his brothers and nephews had goldsmiths on salaries or retainers for what must have been a continuous flow of commissions, whose results are tersely catalogued in various inventories of the period, but of which there are now only a handful of survivals. Only one item mentioned in the records of the Berry collection might match the reliquary, but this was made after 1401, which conflicts with the date suggested by the heraldry. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the reliquary was made and given as a gift, as many such pieces were, in between inventories.|$|E
5|$|The {{year and}} {{circumstances}} of Ragnall's death are uncertain, as surviving contemporary sources failed to mark his demise. According to clan tradition {{preserved in the}} Book of Clanranald, Ragnall may have died in 1207. However, no corroborating evidence supports this date, and {{there is reason to}} believe that dates in this source are unreliable. In fact, this source misplaces Somairle's death by sixteen years, which may indicate that Ragnall himself died some sixteen years earlier (in 1191). If this date is correct then Ragnall's death may be related to his defeat suffered at the hands of his brother. However, the Chronicle of Mann, which records the 1192 conflict between Ragnall and Áengus, gives no hint of Ragnall's demise in its account. <b>Another</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Ragnall may have been slain sometime around 1209 and 1210, during yet more internal conflict amongst the meic Somairle.|$|E
