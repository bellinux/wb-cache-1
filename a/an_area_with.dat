5|$|A {{study of}} trace {{elements}} in mushrooms {{in the eastern}} Black Sea Region of Turkey found E.sinuatum to have {{the highest levels of}} copper (64.8 ± 5.9μg/g dried material—insufficient to be toxic) and zinc (198μg/g) recorded. Caps and stalks tested in <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>with</b> high levels of mercury in southeastern Poland showed it to bioaccumulate much higher levels of mercury than other fungi. The element was also found in high levels in the humus-rich substrate. Entoloma sinuatum also accumulates arsenic-containing compounds. Of the roughly 40μg of arsenic present per gram of fresh mushroom tissue, about 8% was arsenite and the other 92% was arsenate.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Kate {{maintained}} hurricane {{status for}} twelve hours before decelerating {{to the north}} and weakening to a tropical storm. The storm then turned sharply west-southwestward while moving around the eastern side of a mid-level circulation. Passing over progressively warmer waters and into <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>with</b> decreasing vertical shear, Kate regained hurricane status on October 1. Guided by an anticyclone to its north and a cyclonic circulation to its south, the hurricane continued west-southwestward over the subtropical waters of 30°N, and presented a well-defined eye on October 2. On the next day it strengthened to attain major hurricane status, and on October 4 Hurricane Kate reached a peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h) while located 650mi (1,050km) east of Bermuda.|$|E

On 15 March, Erica completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone and later fully dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|The American robin is a known {{reservoir}} (carrier) for West Nile virus. While crows and jays {{are often}} the first noticed deaths in <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>with</b> West Nile virus, the American robin is suspected {{to be a key}} host, and holds a larger responsibility for the transmission of the virus to humans. This is because, while crows and jays die quickly from the virus, the American robin survives the virus longer, hence spreading it to more mosquitoes, which then transmit the virus to humans and other species.|$|E
