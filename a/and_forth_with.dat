5|$|On the 1895 Mazamas expedition, {{the first}} {{heliography}} between {{several of the}} peaks of the Cascades was attempted with some success. A party on Mount Hood was able to communicate back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>with</b> the party on Mount Adams, but the parties on Rainier, Baker, Jefferson, and Diamond Peak were not successful, mainly because of dense smoke and logistical problems.|$|E

5|$|All {{four men}} began the SMW Tag Team Championship match in the ring. The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) {{controlled}} {{most of the}} opening of the match with aerial maneuvers against The Heavenly Bodies (Jimmy Del Ray and Tom Pritchard). Del Ray tried to help his partner but superkicked him instead. The Heavenly Bodies gained the advantage after Pritchard performed a powerbomb on Morton, which Del Ray followed with a moonsault. Del Ray and Morton fought back <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>with</b> Del Ray performing another moonsault and Morton executing a hurricanrana. After all four wrestlers brawled in the ring once more, Del Ray hit Gibson in the back with a tennis racquet. Pritchard then pinned Gibson to win the belts for The Heavenly Bodies.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{athletic}} teams had no official colors and often used gray or maroon and gray for their uniforms. Senior classes would sometimes select colors {{of their own}} choosing. In modern times, the uniforms {{have been based on}} some combination of the four colors of the Maryland flag: red, white, black, and gold. The dominant colors have occasionally changed back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>with</b> changes of the head coach. In 1904, Maryland adopted a state flag based on the heraldry of Lord Calvert: the Calvert family arms (black and gold) quartered with his mother's Crossland family arms (red and white). From the early 1920s until 1942, the black and gold were adopted as the official school colors.|$|E
5|$|The {{illusion}} of endless rows of Klingons {{was created by}} brightly lighting the accused {{in the center of}} the room with a bright blue light, then letting the rest of the set fall into shadow. To give the set a larger appearance, a shot from high above the courtroom was created using miniatures. Inspired by a scene in Ben-Hur, matte supervisor Craig Barron used two hundred commercially available Worf dolls sent by Ralph Winter. Angry Klingons were created by rocking the dolls back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>with</b> motors, waving sticks lit by twelve-volt light bulbs dyed red. The resulting courtroom miniature was ten feet long.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} for the WWE Intercontinental Championship between Rob Van Dam and Shelton Benjamin. Both Van Dam and Benjamin started the match with high spots as Benjamin {{performed}} a Sunset Flip Powerbomb, a move in which a wrestler will roll/flip over an elevated opponent facing them in a reverse body scissors and use the momentum to pull the opponent down to the floor. The match went back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>with</b> action, {{but in the end}} Van Dam performed a Five Star Frog Splash on Benjamin and pinned him to win the match and retain his Money in the Bank briefcase and win the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|Caprellamutica are {{omnivorous}} highly adaptable opportunistic feeders. Examinations {{of their}} stomach contents reveal a highly varied diet that {{depended on the}} particular substrate they are found on. They are predominantly detritivores, but have the remarkable ability of adjusting feeding methods from being grazers, scavengers, filter feeders, and even predators depending on the conditions of their environments. C.mutica sieve food particles or small organisms from the water by waving their bodies back <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>with</b> the comb-like setae on their second pair of antennae extended. They then clean off trapped particles by bending their antennae down to their mouthparts. They also use their antennae to scrape food particles from surfaces of their bodies or the substrate that they are clinging to. The large gnathopods are used for striking at and grasping both mobile and sessile prey. Known prey organisms of C.mutica include algae (both planktonic and macroalgae), dinoflagellates, hydrozoans, bryozoans, diatoms, copepods, brine shrimps, and other amphipods. They are capable of feeding on suspended organic particles, including fish feed and decaying organic matter. C.mutica are also known to engage in cannibalistic behavior on dead and dying individuals of their own species or genus.|$|E
5|$|Danny Baranowsky, the game's {{composer}} and who previously worked with McMillen on Super Meat Boy, was involved early {{on with the}} project shortly {{after the completion of}} the first prototype. McMillen and Baranowsky worked back <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>with</b> McMillen providing artwork from the game and allowing Baranowsky to develop the musical themes based on that; this would often lead to McMillen creating more art to support the music as it progressed. Baranowsky had been drawn to The Binding of Isaac as though the game puts forth a dark tone, he stated it had rather silly undertones underneath and such that one could not take it too seriously. Some of the songs were inspired by classical choral music but modified to fit the theme of the game. Other works were inspired by boss fight songs composed by Nobuo Uematsu for the Final Fantasy series. Baranowsky also had additional time after finishing the main songs for the game to craft short additional tracks that were used for special rooms like shops and secret areas.|$|E

5|$|Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick {{their ears}} whilst sniffing. Playful {{individuals}} will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, {{and raise their}} tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>with</b> their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.|$|E
5|$|Performing live again brought Como a {{new sense}} of enjoyment. In May 1974, he {{embarked}} on his first concert appearance outside of the United States, a show at the London Palladium for the Variety Club of Great Britain to aid children's charities. It was here where he discovered what he had been missing when the audience cheered for ten minutes after he walked onstage. At the show's end, Como sat in a chair, delightedly chatting back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>with</b> his equally delighted fans. Perry returned to the United Kingdom in November for a Royal Variety Performance to benefit the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund with the Queen Mother in attendance. Como was invited to visit Buckingham Palace the day after the show. At first, the invitation did not extend to his associates traveling and working with him, and Como politely declined. When word reached the Palace regarding the reason for Perry's turning down the invitation, it was then extended to include all in the Como party and Como accepted this invitation. Soon after, he announced his first concert tour that began in the UK in the spring of 1975.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} A.J. Styles against Samoa Joe next. Styles' mouth was busted open during the bout. The two wrestlers fought at ringside {{during the opening}} minutes before {{entering}} the ring. Back in the ring Joe and Styles fought back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>with</b> each trading near-falls. Finally, Styles slammed Joe face-first into the mat with his signature Styles Clash maneuver. Joe {{kicked out of the}} following pin, leading to an exchange which allowed Joe to place Styles in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold. After a brief period of time, Styles passed out and the referee awarded Joe the victory and thus became the new TNA X Division Champion at 18 minutes and 58 seconds in. After the match, Joe bashed Styles in the face with the TNA X Division Championship belt and then set up to slam him on a steel chair in the ring but was foalied by Christopher Daniels coming to Styles' defense. A brawl ensued between Joe and Daniels, leading to security breaking it up.|$|E

5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} between Bret and Owen Hart. The {{beginning of the}} match went back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>with</b> neither wrestler gaining a strong advantage. The {{tension between the two}} was demonstrated by Owen's bragging and Bret's refusal to let Owen leave the ring. Owen eventually gained momentum by using a camel clutch on Bret and performing suplexes and a Tombstone piledriver. When Owen stood outside the ring to recuperate, Bret jumped over the top rope to attack him. Bret landed awkwardly, however, and suffered a kayfabe injury to his knee. Owen used a figure four leglock to capitalize on Bret's sore leg. Bret was able to recover, and he kicked Owen {{in the back of the}} head and used a Bulldog and sleeper hold to weaken Owen. Owen regained the advantage, however, and applied the Sharpshooter on Bret. Bret was able to escape and perform a Sharpshooter on Owen. Bret then attempted to end the match with a victory roll, but Owen blocked it and pinned Bret to win the match.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{two main}} event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. Although Mr. Perfect had claimed {{that he would be}} in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the {{beginning}} of the match. Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>with</b> Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers got back into the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect walked down the aisle and stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when he stood up. The Warrior recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable {{to get back into the}} ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together.|$|E

25|$|The second {{match of}} the event was a {{standard}} wrestling match between Ranger Ross and Butch Reed. The match went back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>with</b> Ross dominating the earlier part of the match. The action spilled outside the ring until Reed ran to the ring and Ross chased him. Reed attacked Ross on the apron and brought him inside the ring to perform a Suplex. Reed performed a Diving Shoulder Block on Ross to win the match.|$|E
