They married on 18 December 1983, Richards' 40th birthday, and have two daughters, Theodora Dupree and Alexandra Nicole, born in 1985 and 1986 respectively. In September 2014, Richards {{published}} a children's book with Theodora, Gus and Me: The Story of My Granddad <b>and</b> <b>My</b> <b>First</b> Guitar.

They felt that [...] "this could be somebody’s first single", and decided against Rihanna because of the commercial success of her track [...] "Diamonds" [...] in 2012. Cyrus commented that [...] "it really just {{turned out to be}} perfect and exactly what I wanted, and exactly what I wanted my first sound to be, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> look to be".|$|E

Proud of this Adventure, he encouraged them to increase the level of marketing and advertising for the work. At their advice, he renamed the story from The Adventures of Tintin in the Far East to The Blue Lotus, commenting of this new title: [...] "It is short, it sounds Chinese and it is mysterious." [...] At Casterman's prompting, he also inserted a number of coloured plates throughout the work, and devised a new design for the front cover. The book was finally published in October 1936. Hergé {{was pleased with the}} product, commenting, [...] "I was just bowled over! It is the height of luxury <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> thought was 'It's much too good for children!'... I was far from expecting that." [...] He sent a copy to Zhang, who replied to thank him. After news of its publication reached China, in 1939 political leader Chiang Kai-shek, who had enjoyed The Blue Lotus, asked his wife Soong Mei-ling to invite Hergé to visit them there, although he was unable to do so due to the impending Second World War. He finally took up her offer in 1973, visiting her on the island of Taiwan.|$|E

500|$|In 1976 Hordern {{joined the}} RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he {{appeared}} as Prospero for Trevor Nunn in The Tempest, an engagement which the actor {{found to be}} unpleasant because of his poor relationship with the show's director, Clifford Williams. After that came a short run of Love's Labour's Lost in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite Alan Rickman and Zoë Wanamaker. Hordern was the oldest member {{of the company and}} found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors. Writing in his 1993 biography, Hordern wrote: [...] "Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour. You are at sea for long periods and away from the rest of your service and if the captain of your ship is a good one then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission you serve is very unhappy because you are a long way from land. At Stratford that season I was a long way from land." [...] Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the musical film adaptation of Cinderella, The Slipper and the Rose, and returned to the role of George in Stoppard's Jumpers at the Lyttelton Theatre. The theatre critic Kenneth Hurren [...] "enjoyed it immoderately" [...] and thought the revival revealed a [...] "tidier play than it look". Hordern compared it to the 1972 version by saying: [...] "It is unquestionably a busy little number, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> impression of the piece, back in 1972, was that it had more decoration than substance, and that the decoration was more chaotic than coherent." ...|$|E

The better they've done at making sure there isn't an attack {{the easier it is}} to say there {{was never going to be}} an attack anyway. It's almost as if they should every once in a while have allowed an attack to get through just to remind us." [...] He said: [...] "I would divide the FBI into two agencies. I would have an anti-domestic crime FBI which was very cautious, very respectful of civil liberties, you are innocent until proven guilty. And I would have a small but very aggressive anti-terrorism agency. And I would frankly give them extraordinary ability to eavesdrop. <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> advice to civil libertarians is simple. Don't plot with terrorists." ...|$|E
2500|$|James {{first learned}} to play the cello {{as a child in}} North Carolina and {{switched}} to the guitar in 1960. His guitar style evolved, influenced by hymns, carols, and the music of Woody Guthrie, and his technique derived from his bass clef-oriented cello training and from experimenting on his sister Kate's keyboards: [...] "My style was a finger-picking style that was meant to be like a piano, as if my thumb were my left hand, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>first,</b> second, and third fingers were my right hand." [...] He began attending Milton Academy, a preparatory boarding school in Massachusetts in fall 1961. Summering before then with his family on Martha's Vineyard, he met Danny Kortchmar, an aspiring teenage guitarist from Larchmont, New York. The two began listening to and playing blues and folk music together, and Kortchmar quickly realized that Taylor's singing had a [...] "natural sense of phrasing, every syllable beautifully in time. I knew James had that thing." [...] Taylor wrote his first song on guitar at 14, and he continued to learn the instrument effortlessly. By the summer of 1963, he and Kortchmar were playing coffeehouses around the Vineyard, billed as [...] "Jamie & Kootch".|$|E

2500|$|Three other Sturges stage plays were {{produced}} from 1930 to 1932, {{one of them}} a musical, but none of them were hits. By the end of the year, he was working more in Hollywood as a writer-for-hire, operating on short contracts, for Universal, MGM, and Columbia studios. [...] He also sold his original screenplay for The Power and the Glory (1933) to Fox, where it was filmed as a vehicle for Spencer Tracy. The film told the story of a self-involved financier via a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, and was an acknowledged source of inspiration for the screenwriters of Citizen Kane. Fox producer Jesse Lasky had been prepared to customarily pass Sturges' screenplay along to other writers for rewriting, but said, [...] "It was the most perfect script I'd ever seen... Imagine a producer accepting a script from an author {{and not being able to}} make one change." [...] Lasky paid Sturges $17,500 plus 7% of the profits above $1 million. [...] It was a then-unprecedented deal for a screenwriter, which instantly elevated Sturges' reputation in Hollywood – although the lucrative deal irritated as many as it impressed. Sturges later recalled, [...] "The film made a lot of enemies. Writers at that time worked in teams, like piano movers. <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> solo script was considered a distinct menace to the profession." ...|$|E
