Additionally, the title refers to the mixed up identity tags on the bodies of Omar Little and the middle aged white man in the body bag next to his. The morgue attendant rectifies this by switching them back.|$|R
25|$|A {{codification}} of {{the rules}} of Russian orthography and punctuation was published in 1956 but only a few minor orthographical changes were introduced at that time. The 1956 codification additionally included <b>a</b> <b>clarification</b> of new rules for punctuation developed during the 1930s, and which had not been mentioned in the 1918 decree.|$|E
25|$|More {{than one}} third of the content of The Urantia Book is devoted to a {{narrative}} of the life and teachings of Jesus, and the Judeo-Christian tradition is given an importance exceeding any other. The book's teachings claim to be <b>a</b> <b>clarification</b> and expansion of Christian belief. However, numerous differences are noted between its teachings and commonly accepted Christian doctrines.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, an EEZ was set {{within the}} {{territorial}} waters between Israel and Cyprus at the maritime halfway point, <b>a</b> <b>clarification</b> essential for safeguarding Israel's rights to oil and underwater gas reservoirs.

25|$|On April 12, 2011, Glass {{made a note}} on the TAL blog that <b>a</b> <b>clarification</b> and a {{correction}} had been made to the story on the web.

After reviewing court documents, Glass concluded that it was for violating the terms and conditions of the Drug Court sentence and contract, and not for failing to pay the $1,500 program costs assessed to drug court participants.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, an {{agreement}} was signed with Cyprus concerning {{the limit of}} territorial waters between Israel and Cyprus at the maritime halfway point, <b>a</b> <b>clarification</b> essential for safeguarding Israel's rights to oil and underwater gas reservoirs. The agreement was signed in Nicosia by Israeli Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau and the Cypriot Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou. The two countries agreed to cooperate {{in the development of}} any cross border resources discovered, and to negotiate {{an agreement}} on dividing joint resources, however this area is not a true EEZ as described in the UNCLOS.|$|E
40|$|Apart {{from the}} {{practical}} {{problems that we}} are faced with in the case of organ donation, there lay a series of terminological issues in need of <b>a</b> thorough <b>clarification.</b> Recently, the ELPAT group on living donors (Ethical, Legal and Psychological Aspects of Organ Transplantation) has proposed <b>a</b> new <b>clarification</b> for living organ donors.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experiment}} where {{subjects were asked}} to listen to Swedish human-computer dialogue fragments where a synthetic voice makes <b>an</b> elliptical <b>clarification</b> after <b>a</b> user turn. The prosodic features of the synthetic voice were systematically varied, and {{subjects were asked to}} judge the computer’s actual intention. The results show that an early low F 0 peak signals acceptance, that a late high peak is perceived as <b>a</b> request for <b>clarification</b> of what was said, and that a mid high peak is perceived as <b>a</b> request for <b>clarification</b> of the meaning of what was said. The study {{can be seen as the}} beginnings of a tentative model for intonation of clarification ellipses in Swedish, which can be implemented and tested in spoken dialogue systems...|$|R
25|$|Russia's 1993 {{currency}} reform {{was intended to}} tame inflation and exchange the banknotes remaining in circulation from 1961 to 1992 for banknotes of a new design. The reform was confiscatory, as {{there were a number}} of restrictions on the exchange of banknotes. In addition, the reform was carried out during the summer holidays, which created additional problems for citizens. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation issued <b>a</b> <b>clarification</b> that the exchange of banknotes after 1 October 1993 would be made exclusively on presentation of documents that proved the impossibility of exchange in a timely manner.|$|E
25|$|The {{adjustment}} {{would therefore}} rationalise any {{search for the}} city in search engines, since Foz do Iguaçu's claim to fame worldwide is due almost entirely to the falls, which are known as the Iguassu Falls. Djalma Pastorello felt that tourism {{to the city of}} Foz do Iguaçu would be improved greatly by <b>a</b> <b>clarification</b> of its association with the now-famous Iguassu Falls. However, he estimates that 70% of the city's population were against the name change because the local media anticipated the change and presented it in a distorted way, so that locals were unable to see that the intention was to benefit the population.|$|E
25|$|The term {{thermal wind}} is often {{considered}} a misnomer, since it really describes {{the change in}} wind with height, rather the wind itself. However, one can view the thermal wind as a geostrophic wind that varies with height, so that the term wind seems appropriate. In {{the early years of}} meteorology, when data was scarce, the wind field could be estimated using the thermal wind relation and knowledge of a surface wind speed and direction as well as thermodynamic soundings aloft. In this way, the thermal wind relation acts to define the wind itself, rather than just its shear. Many authors retain the thermal wind moniker, even though it describes a wind gradient, sometimes offering <b>a</b> <b>clarification</b> to that effect.|$|E

25|$|The CPJP and UFDR {{continued}} to fight {{over control of}} artisanal diamond fields in western CAR, especially around Bria. In April the CPJP {{announced that it was}} ready to end fighting, but made the initiation of peace talks conditional on <b>a</b> <b>clarification</b> by the government of the status of former CPJP head Charles Massi, who had been missing and presumed to have been killed in a government prison. After intensified government and international mediation efforts, the CPJP signed a ceasefire with the government on June 12. Violence soon resumed and more than 50 deaths were reported in September 2011. On 8 October the CPJP and the UFDR (now aligned with the government) signed a peace agreement in Bangui, calling for the demilitarization of Bria.|$|E
25|$|Notable legal views include Sweden, where a 2005 {{report by}} the Swedish Animal Welfare Agency for the {{government}} expressed concern over the increase in reports of horse-ripping incidents. The agency believed current animal cruelty legislation was not sufficient in protecting animals from abuse and needed updating, but concluded that on balance it was not appropriate {{to call for a}} ban. In New Zealand, the 1989 Crimes Bill considered abolishing bestiality as a criminal offense, and instead viewing it as a mental health issue, but they did not, and people can still be prosecuted for it. Under Section 143 of the Crimes Act 1961, individuals can serve a sentence of seven years duration for animal sexual abuse and the offence is considered 'complete' in the event of 'penetration'. In Canada <b>a</b> <b>clarification</b> of the anti-bestiality law was made in 2016 which legalizes most forms of sexual contact with animals other than penetration.|$|E
25|$|The first, {{descriptive}} task naturally requires <b>a</b> <b>clarification</b> of one's terms, above all, {{the word}} religion. Historians of religion have long underscored the problematic {{character of this}} term, noting that its usage over the centuries has changed in significant ways, generally {{in the direction of}} reification. The early psychologists of religion were fully aware of these difficulties, typically acknowledging that the definitions they were choosing to use were to some degree arbitrary. With the rise of positivistic trends in psychology {{over the course of the}} 20th century, especially the demand that all phenomena be measured, psychologists of religion developed a multitude of scales, most of them developed for use with Protestant Christians. Factor analysis was also brought into play by both psychologists and sociologists of religion, in an effort to establish a fixed core of dimensions and a corresponding set of scales. The justification and adequacy of these efforts, especially in the light of constructivist and other postmodern viewpoints, remains a matter of debate.|$|E
50|$|After the election, Seah made {{an online}} appeal for {{donations}} for her campaign on her Facebook account, sparking off {{a debate on}} whether it is appropriate. On 23 May 2011, the NSP issued <b>a</b> public <b>clarification</b> statement and supported her actions.|$|R

50|$|In 1786, the {{constitution}} was amended with language {{proposed by the}} 1785 Council of Censors, their first meeting, and adopted by the 1786 Constitutional Convention.

25|$|In December 2014, the eco-socialist United Left party {{introduced}} a bill amending expansion {{of the definition of}} marriage in the 1976 Marriage and Family Relations Act to include same-sex couples. In January 2015, the Government expressed no opposition to the bill. In February 2015, the bill was passed with 11 votes to 2. In March, the Assembly passed the bill in a 51–28 vote. On 10 March 2015, the National Council rejected a motion to require the Assembly to vote on the bill again, in a 14–23 vote. Opponents of the bill launched a petition for a referendum and managed to collect 40,000 signatures. Then Parliament voted to block the referendum with <b>a</b> <b>clarification</b> that it would be against the Slovenian Constitution to vote about matters concerning human rights. Finally the Constitutional Court ruled against the banning of the referendum (5–4) and the referendum was to be held on 20 December 2015.|$|E
25|$|Duke Snider {{finished}} second to teammate Campanella in the MVP voting by just five points, 226–221, with each man receiving eight first place votes. The voting {{then as now}} was conducted by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Each voting member, one from each major league city, filled out a ballot selecting ten men. A player receiving a first place vote got 14 points, 9 points for second, and then values of 8–7–6–5–4–3–2–1 for those in places 3 through 10. A writer from Philadelphia who was sick and who had become hospitalized had turned in a ballot with Campanella listed in position number 1 as well as position number 5. The assumption had been that the writer had meant to write Snider's name {{into one of those}} slots. Unable to get <b>a</b> <b>clarification</b> from the ill writer the BBWAA, after considering disallowing the ballot, decided to accept it, count the first place vote for Campanella and count the fifth place vote as though it were left blank. Had the ballot been disallowed, the vote would have been won by Snider by three points. Had Snider gotten the fifth place vote, the final vote would have favored Snider 227–226. Duke did, however, win the Sporting News National League Player of the Year Award for 1955 and the Sid Mercer Award.|$|E
