25|$|In spring 1865, Kocher {{followed}} his teacher Biermer to Zürich, where Theodor Billroth {{was director of}} the hospital and influenced Kocher significantly. Kocher then proceeded to start a journey through Europe to meet several of the most famous surgeons of the time. It is not clear how Kocher financed his trip but according to Bonjour (1981) he received money from an unknown female Suisse romande philanthropist who also supported his friend Marc Dufour and was probably a member of the Moravian Church. In October 1865, he traveled to Berlin, passing through Leipzig and visiting an old friend from high school, Hans Blum. In Berlin, he studied under Bernhard von Langenbeck and applied for an assistant position with Langenbeck and Rudolf Virchow. Since there was no position available, in April 1867 Kocher moved on to London where he first met Jonathan Hutchinson and then worked for Henry Thompson and John Erichsen. Furthermore, he was interested in the work of Isaac Baker Brown and Thomas Spencer Wells, who also invited Kocher to go to the opera with his family.

Despite these flaws, Jackson said he would tune in next week because he would [...] "rather have a show {{err on the side of}} unbelievable than unremarkable, and I'm interested to see if Abrams has any more tricks up his sleeve". Erin Fox of TV Guide also liked [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] better than the pilot because she thought that it [...] "had really cool special effects, awesome Walter-isms, and actual chemistry forming between Olivia and Peter", and [...] "we <b>also</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> delve more into the connections between Walter, Nina Sharp, Massive Dynamic and the government and the experiments they conducted before Walter was institutionalized".|$|E

500|$|Clay and Webster were at {{the head}} of perhaps 5,000 Whig {{speakers}} who criss-crossed the nation in Harrison's cause. Clay was unenthusiastic about the idea of being a stump speaker, but warmed to it as he sought to boost himself to be Whig presidential candidate in 1844 (Harrison had promised to serve only one term), and spoke widely, especially in the South, though he mentioned Harrison infrequently. Another prominent speaker was a Whig state assemblyman from Illinois and candidate for presidential elector from that state, Abraham Lincoln, who spoke to a crowd of 15,000 in Springfield, Illinois, wearing jeans. The aristocratic South Carolina former congressman, Hugh Legare also spoke widely, and took to wearing a coonskin cap on the campaign trail, drinking hard cider as he partied with the [...] "Log Cabin Boys". John Bear, the [...] "Buckeye Blacksmith", from South Bloomfield, Ohio was a prominent Whig speaker. After making a hit in his first speech outside his home town at the February Columbus rally, the Whigs sent him on the road as a person who could appeal to the tradesmen and farmers who made up much of the electorate. He <b>also</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> associate with the elite, meeting Harrison at North Bend and attending a party at the Washington home of former president John Quincy Adams. Bear made 331 speeches, the most of any Whig surrogate, and inspired other craftsmen like Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, the [...] "Natick Cobbler", who would rise to the vice presidency under Grant.|$|E

Hendrickson was happy with the storyline, stating that [...] "it was my supporting actors who supported me through the entire shooting day, and the writing. It was just all wrapped up in a neat little package. I could not ask for a better show." [...] Delia needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. Billy is being forced away from town by his wife's father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). Victor arranges for Billy to secretly be able to donate his bone marrow, saving Delia's life, though he passes the donation off as Kevin's. Hendrickson praised the writing for the storyline as a [...] "full arc" [...] which had a [...] "beginning, middle and an end". She said, [...] "It was a great story. I got to show a lot of range, and <b>also</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> work with some great supporting actors who were in those scenes." [...] For the 39th Daytime Emmy Awards, Hendrickson submitted the scenes in which Chloe is informed of Delia's leukemia, which allowed her to receive a nomination in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. In July 2013, Delia has a health scare.

2500|$|A further {{strategy}} {{aimed at}} diminishing the power dynamic between photographer/subject {{was to have}} each participant choose their own image, with the option of re-photographing them if they desired. [...] Fulbeck states, [...] "... every participant not only got to write their statement the way they wanted to, they <b>also</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> pick their own image. A camera is a tremendously powerful tool and the power dynamic between photographer and subject is palpable. For this reason, I wanted to give some of the power back to the subjects. It {{was never going to}} be completely democratic – it is, after all, my concept, my project, and my design – but there are some strategies you can employ to make it less unilateral. Everyone got to see their image and choose to keep it or erase it and shoot again." [...] One participant was re-photographed 27 times.|$|E
2500|$|Abo {{noted that}} {{while all the}} games are part of one series, their sound have {{different}} images; comparing them to weather, he called Chaos;Head rainy, Steins;Gate cloudy, Robotics;Notes clear weather, and Chaos;Child stormy. He used the same process {{for all of them}} when composing the music: he started by reading the story, to understand the setting and characters as well as possible, and writing down notes about the games' emotional flow and the situations that occur throughout the stories. Using these notes, he constructed musical worldviews for the games, with a lot of weight on his first impressions. This approach, while slower than just designating songs to different areas of a game, allowed him to compose higher-quality songs with a better relationship to the games' worldviews. He was given a lot of freedom when working on the series, and was able to make the music he wanted to make for it, something he enjoyed greatly. Abo <b>also</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> compose each game's theme song, and was especially happy with Steins;Gate theme song, [...] "Gate of Steiner", which he aimed to represent the entirety of the game with.|$|E
