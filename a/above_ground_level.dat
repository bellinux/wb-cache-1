Because the Trump Tower has both hotel condominiums and residential condominiums, it does not contest the record held by the 88-story 432 Park Avenue in New York City, which, at , is the tallest residential building in the world.|$|E
5|$|Antankarana {{homes are}} {{typically}} raised on stilts <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b> Young men seeking {{to start a}} family typically leave their father's house and build their own from wood and thatch gathered locally. After marrying a young woman will leave her family's home to move into her husband's house, where she manages the household and assists in planting and harvesting rice. The husband is responsible for earning money for basic necessities and farming the family's land. A young couple typically receives furniture and other essentials as wedding gifts from friends, family and community members. Divorce and remarriage are common in Antankarana society.|$|E
5|$|The B-52 aircraft, callsign Czar 52, {{took off}} at 13:58 and {{completed}} {{most of the}} mission's elements without incident. Upon preparing to execute the touch-and-go on Runway 23 {{at the end of}} the practice profile, the aircraft was instructed to go around because a KC-135 aircraft had just landed and was on the runway. Maintaining an altitude of about 250 feet (75m) <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> (AGL), Holland radioed the control tower and asked for permission to execute a 360Â° left turn, which was immediately granted by the tower controller.|$|E

5|$|The Barnhouse Settlement is {{a cluster}} of at least fifteen buildings, {{including}} one {{that may have been}} used for communal gatherings, occupied between 3200-2950 BC. The design of the houses, which were built <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level,</b> includes a central hearth, recessed box beds and stone dressers. There is a network of stone drains leading to a common ditch. Pottery of the grooved ware type, flints and stone tools have been found, as well as three flakes of pitchstone thought to have come from the Isle of Arran.|$|E
5|$|Fruit in {{blackcurrants}} {{is borne}} primarily on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b> This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots. An established bush {{should not be allowed to}} become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.|$|E
5|$|The {{peoples of}} early Iron Age Scotland, {{particularly}} {{in the north and}} west, lived in substantial stone buildings called Atlantic roundhouses. The remains of hundreds of these houses exist throughout the country, some merely piles of rubble, others with impressive towers and outbuildings. They date from about 800 to 300 with the most imposing structures having been created around the 2ndcentury. The most massive constructions that date from this time are the circular broch towers. On average, the ruins only survive up to a few metres <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level,</b> although there are five extant examples of towers whose walls still exceed 6.5m (21ft) in height. There are at least 100 broch sites in Scotland. Despite extensive research, their purpose {{and the nature of the}} societies that created them are still a matter of debate.|$|E

5|$|Modern radar scans many angles {{around the}} site. Reflectivity values at {{multiple}} angles <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> {{in a storm}} are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels. Summing reflectivities in the Vertically Integrated Liquid or VIL, gives the liquid water content in the cloud. Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm {{is related to the}} evolution of VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate. Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research. Some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Most terns breed on open sandy or rocky {{areas on}} coasts and islands. The yellow-billed, large-billed, and black-fronted terns breed only on rivers, and common, least and little terns also {{sometimes}} use inland locations. The marsh terns, Trudeau's tern and some Forster's terns nest in inland marshes. The black noddy {{and the white}} tern nest <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> on cliffs or in trees. Migratory terns move to the coast after breeding, and most species winter near land, although some marine species, like the Aleutian tern, may wander far from land. The sooty tern is entirely oceanic when not breeding, and healthy young birds are not seen on land {{for up to five}} years after fledging until they return to breed. They lack waterproof plumage, so they cannot rest on the sea. Where they spend the years prior to breeding is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Temple {{structures}} were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches. Walls and other {{structures were}} built with large blocks of varying shapes. The blocks were laid in courses, usually without mortar. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked. The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones. To build structures <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level,</b> the workers used construction ramps. When cutting chambers in living rock, workers excavated {{from the top}} down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor. Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, reliefs were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer of plaster that covered the stone surface. Reliefs were then decorated with gilding, inlay, or paint. The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments {{with some kind of}} adhesive, possibly natural gum.|$|E

5|$|The Hotel Valley Ho is a {{striking}} example of the mid-century modern architectural style. Varney's use of masonry, cast and poured concrete, natural stone, and wide expanses of glass make for a close connection between the building and its environment. Stone floor and wall patterns link the exterior entry and the lobby, as does {{the extension of the}} redwood ceiling. The hotel is now considered one of the finest examples of organic architecture. Rooms in the two adjacent wings added in the late 1950s are unusual, and remarkably forward-thinking even by mid-century design standards, for their high nine-foot-ceilings. The prevailing trend at the time of original construction was low-ceilinged rooms, in some cases with ceilings only seven feet <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level,</b> but the Valley Ho's rooms feel exceptionally roomy and airy thanks to its original decision to buck design trends.|$|E
5|$|The elytra allow beetles to both fly {{and move}} through {{confined}} spaces, doing so by folding the delicate wings under the elytra while not flying, and folding their wings out just before take off. The unfolding and folding of the wings is operated by muscles {{attached to the}} wing base; {{as long as the}} tension on the radial and cubital veins remains, the wings remain straight. In some day-flying species (for example, Buprestidae, Scarabaeidae), flight does not include large amounts of lifting of the elytra, having the metathorac wings extended under the lateral elytra margins. The altitude reached by beetles in flight varies. One study investigating the flight altitude of the ladybird species Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis using radar showed that, whilst the majority in flight over a single location were at 150â195m <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level,</b> some reached altitudes of over 1100m.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to characterise the anemometric {{conditions}} in north-eastern Poland in 2001 - 2010. Documentation material containing the average daily wind speed at 10 m <b>above</b> the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> was obtained from the Institute of Meteorology and Climatology â National Research Institute from meteorological stations located in Elblag, KÄtrzyn, MikoÅajki, Olsztyn and SuwaÅki. The wind speed at heights of 60, 80, 100 and 120 m <b>above</b> the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> was calculated by the exponential and logarithmic formulae based on output data. The number of days with wind speeds â¥ 4 mÂ·s- 1 was also calculated at heights of 80 and 100 m <b>above</b> the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> which are most frequently used to install wind turbines. The obtained results indicated that the most favourable anemometric conditions to locate the wind turbines were {{in the northern part of}} the studied area of Poland, near SuwaÅki and KÄtrzyn and the least favourable were in MikoÅajki and Olsztyn...|$|R
