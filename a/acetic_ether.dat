In the electrospinning process, a high-voltage power supply (BGG 6 - 358, BMEI Co., Ltd. China) was used to provide voltage (15  kV). To avoid air bubbles, the spinning solutions were carefully loaded into a 5 -ml syringe, to which a stainless-steel capillary metal-hub needle with an inside diameter of 0.5  mm was attached. The positive electrode of the high-voltage power supply {{was connected to the}} needle tip. The earthed electrode was connected to a metal collector wrapped with aluminum foil. Electrospinning was carried out under ambient conditions, and fibers were collected 15  cm from the syringe tip. The feed rate of the solutions was controlled at 2  ml/h using a single syringe pump (789100 C, Cole-Parmer Instruments, USA). As-prepared samples were dried under vacuum to remove residual organic solvents before further use.|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) {{is a growing}} public health problem with an urgent need for new {{pharmacological}} agents. Cordyceps cicadae is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and has potential renoprotective benefits. The current study aimed to determine any scientific evidence to support its clinical use. Methods: We analyzed the potential of two kinds of C. cicadae extract, total extract (TE) and <b>acetic</b> <b>ether</b> extract (AE), in treating kidney disease simulated by a subtotal nephrectomy (SNx) model. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into seven groups: sham-operated group, vehicle-treated SNx, Cozaar, 2 g/(kg∙d) TE SNx, 1 g/(kg∙d) TE SNx, 92 mg/(kg∙d) AE SNx, and 46 mg/(kg∙d) AE SNx. Renal injury was monitored using urine and serum analyses, and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stainings were {{used to analyze the}} level of fibrosis. The expression of type IV collagen (Col IV), fibronectin (FN), transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: Renal injury, reflected in urine and serum analyses, and pathological changes induced by SNx were attenuated by TE and AE intervention. The depositions of Col IV and FN were also decreased by the treatments and were accompanied by reduced expression of TGF-β 1 and CTGF. In some respects, 2 g/(kg∙d) of TE produced better effects than Cozaar. Conclusions: For the first time, we have shown that C. cicadae may inhibit renal fibrosis in vivo through the TGF-β 1 /CTGF pathway. Therefore, we conclude that the use of C. cicadae could provide a rational strategy for combating renal fibrosis...|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} work: {{the investigation of the}} aseptic and infection inflammation processes under the conditions of action of the bornilacetate and isobornilacetate, and justification of application of the preparations of this group for the directed correction of the inflammation process. The complex effect of the borneol <b>acetic</b> <b>ethers</b> (antiinflammatory, analgetic, antibacterial and dehydrating) on the wound process; the anti-inflammation effect of the borneol <b>acetic</b> <b>ethers</b> has been conditioned by the variation of the microorganism resistance and pathogenous properties of microorganisms.

30|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that successful approaches to more economical production technologies of biosurfactant will be a collaborative approach involving process development and sustainable raw materials supplies. According to Smyth et al. (Smyth et al. 2010 a, b) emphasis should be on cost effective management of downstream processing. The potential to obtain pure biosurfactants is dependent on several complex extraction and purification steps. Use of simple substrates with less downstream processing will economize the process and the use of agricultural substrates and their wastes represents a positive step towards achieving that goal. Some of the prevalent downstream processing process uses solvent extraction (e.g. chloroform-methanol, dichloromethane-methanol, butanol, ethyl acetate, pentane, hexane, <b>acetic</b> acid, <b>ether)</b> or acid precipitation, use of ammonium sulfate precipitation, crystallization, centrifugation, adsorption and foam fractionation (Chen et al. 2008; Kaar et al. 2009; Martins et al. 2006; Mukherjee et al. 2006; Neto et al. 2009). Use of statistical experimental strategies including factorial design and response surface methodology (RSM) will help in better optimization of solid state production of biosurfactants. Recently, (Kiran et al. (2010 a) reported the production of a new glycolipid biosurfactant from marine Nocardiopsis lucentensis MSA 04 in solid-state cultivation. More studies are needed on these processes for efficient production of biosurfactants. The availability of processes with limited downstream processing will give significant economical advantages and have been sought after.|$|R

The effects of four different extract on nitrite scavenging (NS) and nitrosamine formation inhibiting (NFI) were evaluated in vitro systems. Results showed {{that all the}} extract showed NS and NFI potentials with a dose-dependent manner. With regard to NS activity, at 50 µg/mL, the scavenging rates of ethyl acetate and methanol extracts were 96. 65 % and 93. 48 %, respectively. While, those of petroleum ether and water extract were only 86. 96 % and 26. 09 %, respectively. With regard to NFI activity, at 200 µg/mL, both petroleum ether and ethyl acetate extracts showed excellent inhibition abilities of 94. 46 % and 91. 33 %, respectively, much {{higher than those of}} methanol and water extract (78. 57 % and 4. 06 %, respectively) (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Gasification {{technologies}} convert {{coal and}} other heavy feedstocks into synthesis gas feed streams {{that can be}} used in the production of a wide variety of chemicals, ranging from hydrogen through methanol, ammonia, <b>acetic</b> anhydride, dimethyl <b>ether</b> (DME), methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), high molecular weight liquid hydrocarbons and waxes. Syngas can also be burned directly as a fuel in advanced power cycles to generate electricity with very high efficiency. However, the coal-derived synthesis gas contains a myriad of trace contaminants that may poison the catalysts that are used in the downstream manufacturing processes and may also be regulated in power plant emissions. Particularly, the catalysts used in the conversion of synthesis gas to methanol and other liquid fuels (Fischer-Tropsch liquids) have been found to be very sensitive to the low levels of poisons, especially arsenic, that are present in the synthesis gas from coal. TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) is developing an expendable high capacity, low-cost chemical absorbent to remove arsenic from coal-derived syngas. Unlike most of the commercially available sorbents that physically adsorb arsenic, TDA’s sorbent operates at elevated temperatures and removes the arsenic through chemical reaction.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the potential of}} an electronic nose technique {{in the field of}} fast diagnostics of patients suspected of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The investigations were performed using a simple electronic nose prototype equipped with a set of six semiconductor sensors manufactured by FIGARO Co. They were aimed at verification of a possibility of differentiation between model reference mixtures with potential COPD markers (N,N-dimethylformamide and N,N-dimethylacetamide). These mixtures contained volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as acetone, isoprene, carbon disulphide, propan- 2 -ol, formamide, benzene, toluene, acetonitrile, <b>acetic</b> acid, dimethyl <b>ether,</b> dimethyl sulphide, acrolein, furan, propanol and pyridine, recognized as the components of exhaled air. The model reference mixtures were prepared at three concentration levels— 10 ppb, 25 ppb, 50 ppb v/v—of each component, except for the COPD markers. Concentration of the COPD markers in the mixtures was from 0 ppb to 100 ppb v/v. Interpretation of the obtained data employed principal component analysis (PCA). The investigations revealed the usefulness of the electronic device only in the case when the concentration of the COPD markers was twice as high as the concentration of the remaining components of the mixture and for a limited number of basic mixture components...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{selective}} catalytic reduction (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NOx) with ethane, ethene, <b>acetic</b> acid, dimethyl <b>ether</b> (DME) and ethanol, respectively, over alumina-supported silver and indium catalysts. The impact of hydrogen {{and the nature of}} the reductant on the catalyst structure and SCR activity are studied. The ability to reduce NOx differs significantly among the studied reductants, but also between the two catalysts, of which Ag/Al 2 O 3 is the overall most active catalyst. However, the In/Al 2 O 3 catalyst exhibits high SCR activity with DME as reductant in contrast to the Ag/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, which shows negligible activity. We attribute this difference to the higher number of acidic sites on the In/Al 2 O 3 catalyst and the higher degree of DME combustion over Ag/Al 2 O 3. Moreover, the number of sites that previously have been identified to promote hydrocarbon activation, i. e. silver cluster sites (Agnδ+) in Ag/Al 2 O 3 catalysts and indium cluster sites (In 3 +) in In/Al 2 O 3 catalysts, are shown to increase upon addition of small amounts of hydrogen in the feed. We suggest that the increased SCR activity over In/Al 2 O 3 originates from an increased number of sites for activation of hydrocarbons, analogous to previous proposals for Ag-based catalysts, in combination with a direct effect on the reaction mechanism...|$|R
40|$|PDEMixed {{metal oxides}} {{have been used}} as {{catalysts}} for the partial oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. The solids were shown to be active and selective for the reaction at relatively low temperature. Various physical techniques have been used to establish the active sites for this reaction and understand the role of the different elements. The results obtained showed that Bronsted acidic sites were involved in the formation of diethyl <b>ether,</b> <b>acetic</b> acid, and ethyl acetate and that vanadium was the active site, whereas the Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + redox couple did not play any role. The most important outcome of this study is the observed activity dependence on surface V 5 + cations content. These surface V 5 + cations, which were formed {{as a result of the}} evolution of the surface composition of the solid solution in oxidative atmosphere, should not be considered as part of the bulk oxide, but as supra-surface species. When the solid solution is vanadium rich, the substitution mechanism in the bulk structure generates cationic vacancies that inhibited the formation of these surface species likely by blocking their diffusion to the surface. This study underlines the importance of both the supra-surface species and the bulk structure of oxidation catalysts. While it confirms that the formation of supra-surface species occurs in mixed oxides oxidation catalysts, it also demonstrates that this formation strongly depends on the bulk structure.

University of Missouri 1913 In {{the course of}} a study of the methods of {{analysis}} of cotton seed oil from linoleic acid, by means of the isolation of the acid as its bromine compound, the end product of the analysis which should have been linoleic tetrabromide with a melting point of 113 - 115 degrees Celsius was instead a white crystalline compound with properties widely different from the linoleic tetrabromide which is described by Lewkowitsch, Hazura, Farnsteiner, etc. The crystals obtained were large needle shaped prism forms arranged in radiating clusters, with a specific gravity much less than that of linoleic tetrabromide. After several purifications from ninety-five percent alcohol, the crystals possessed a definite melting point not 58 - 58. 5 degrees Celsius. The crystals were also much more soluble in ninety-five percent alcohol, glacial <b>acetic</b> acid, petroleum <b>ether</b> and other organic solvents than linoleic tetrabromide and could be crystallized from all these solvents in the same form as obtained from alcohol. It at once became apparent that the body thus obtained was worthy of careful study as a possible means of explaining the wide discrepance between the theoretical percentage of linoleic acid in cottonseed oil and the percentage which has been obtained by actual analysis. The importance of the body was considerably enhanced, also on account of the fact that an isomer of the ordinary linoleic tetrabromide of cottonseed oil has been obtained by Thomas from Telfairia oil, which according to that author gave a tetrabromide with a melting point of 57 - 58 degrees Celsius. The investigation, which is here reported, was carried out with the purpose of explaining the formation of the unknown compound, its chemical composition, its relation to the isomeric linoleic acid obtained by Thoms, and its relation to the isomeric linolic acid obtained by Thoms, and its relation to the composition of cottonseed oil.
