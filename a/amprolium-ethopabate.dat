In Experiment 1, a pea-corn diet was supplemented with 5 levels of methionine (0 to. 3 %) in combination with amprolium-etho-pabate (125 to 140 ppm), lasalocid (125 ppm), or monensin (121 ppm). In the second experiment, two different types of diets (corn-soy and pea-corn) were used which differed primarily in the source of protein. These two diets were supplemented with methionine (. 1 %), lincomycin (2 ppm), or a combination of lincomycin and methionine. Either lasalocid (100 ppm) or monensin (100 ppm) was used as a coccidiostat. At a suboptimum level of sulfur-containing amino acids (SAA), lasalocid in Experiments 1 and 2 and lincomycin in Experiment 2 were found to have growth and feed efficiency stimulating effects. The SAA requirement for growth was reduced by as much as. 1 % in the presence of lasalo-cid. The SAA requirement was not affected by the use of monensin up to 49 days, but it was considerably increased after 49 days due to a faster rate of gain brought on by the withdrawal of monensin from the diet. The different coccidiostats and methionine had significant effects o...|$|E
