5|$|Nevertheless, {{because the}} judge is {{empowered}} to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and can apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to any particular case through ijtihad, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases. There is <b>a</b> <b>presumption</b> against overturning a decision when {{it is based on}} ijtihad. This principle is crucial in two respects. Firstly, it concentrates the substance of the law in the hands of judges as, in consequence, there is <b>a</b> <b>presumption</b> that only a judge exercising ijtihad, rather than a king or a parliament, can determine God's law. Secondly, it renders a judge's decision practically immune to reversal on appeal. The role of ijtihad has led to calls for the Sharia to be codified to give clarity and remove uncertainty. As a result, in 2010, the Minister of Justice announced plans to implement a codification of Sharia law, although resistance from the religious establishment is reportedly delaying its implementation.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss a criminal charge {{on the ground}} that he or she has been singled out for prosecution because of race, gender, religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim, the defendant must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races. The defendant is not entitled to <b>a</b> <b>presumption</b> of selective prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} approach to Arctic exploration had relied on large-scale forces, with <b>a</b> <b>presumption</b> that European techniques could be successfully transplanted into the hostile polar climate. Over the years this strategy had brought little success, and {{had led to}} heavy losses of men and ships. By contrast, Nansen's method of using small, trained crews, and harnessing Inuit and Sami expertise in his methods of travel, had ensured that his expedition was completed without a single casualty or major mishap.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{conclusive}} <b>presumption</b> (in Latin, praesumptio iuris et de iure), {{also known}} as <b>an</b> irrebuttable <b>presumption,</b> is <b>a</b> type of <b>presumption</b> used in several legal systems.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the actual}} legal effect of <b>a</b> legal <b>presumption</b> {{is not the}} legal {{determination}} of <b>a</b> fact. Most <b>presumptions</b> are rebuttable. What <b>a</b> legal <b>presumption</b> does is relieve one party of having to prove a particular fact once a precedent fact is proven, but most presumptions are rebuttable. The presumption shifts {{the burden of proof}} from one party to the other.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, however, <b>a</b> rebuttable <b>presumption</b> {{can also}} work {{in favor of}} the accused. For instance, in Australia, there is <b>a</b> rebuttable <b>presumption</b> that <b>a</b> child aged at least 10 but less than 14 is {{incapable}} of committing a criminal act.|$|R
5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated <b>a</b> <b>presumption</b> of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E
5|$|Daily fantasy {{services}} have historically blocked residents of Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and Washington {{from participating in}} paid games, under <b>a</b> <b>presumption</b> that DFS is illegal in these states due to the strictness of their gambling laws. However, a November 2015 investigation by The New York Times found that these geoblock restrictions could easily be circumvented using anonymous proxies, and {{it was estimated that}} in 2014, DraftKings had still collected $484,897 in entry fees from players in the five states where it had voluntarily asserted that DFS was illegal. These reports led to regulatory probes by investigators in the aforementioned states. Both websites have since implemented measures to block proxy users.|$|E
5|$|Human Rights Watch, {{in their}} 2008 report on Saudi Arabian {{criminal}} justice system, {{noted that the}} criminal procedure code introduced in 2002 lacked some basic protections but, as mentioned above, had been ignored by judges in any case. Those arrested are often not informed {{of the crime of}} which they are accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture if they do not confess. At trial, there is <b>a</b> <b>presumption</b> of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret, that is, without the public or press. The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as beheading, stoning, amputation and lashing, and the number of executions have also been strongly criticized.|$|E

2500|$|About {{twenty years}} after Pearce was decided, the Court impliedly {{overruled}} Pearce in Alabama v. Smith, 490 U.S. 794 (1989). As a result, current jurisprudence interprets Pearce’s holding to provide a defendant with <b>a</b> “rebuttable <b>presumption</b> of vindictiveness.” [...] This doctrine of <b>a</b> rebuttable <b>presumption</b> of vindictiveness, absent an affirmative indication of objective facts justifying an increased sentence, {{is referred to as}} the Pearce Principle.|$|R
5|$|They are {{responsible}} for pollination of approximately {{one third of the}} United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, and strawberries. Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on cucurbits), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is <b>a</b> <b>presumption</b> that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).|$|E
5|$|Because of {{new ideas}} about the {{treatment}} of alcoholism, the lifetime suspension was downgraded to a 10-year suspension in 1952. DUI prosecutions remained difficult in cases when drivers refused to take a Breathalyzer test, and so in 1966, the state authorized the suspension of a person's driver's license for refusing to submit a breath sample. In 1977, the BAC limit was reduced to 0.10%, but the law was modified to differentiate between {{the second and third}} offenses, with lesser penalties for first and second convictions. In 1983, the state established a per se rule wherein a person over the limit was considered drunk in all cases (that is, not merely <b>a</b> <b>presumption).</b> Nine years later, the 0.01% BAC limit for drivers under 21 was instituted, and in 2003, the 0.10% BAC limit was reduced to 0.08% to comply with federal highway funding requirements.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 percent {{weight by volume}} blood alcohol content (BAC) as the {{threshold}} for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is possible {{to be charged with}} driving under the influence (DUI) with a BAC level below 0.08%, but there is <b>a</b> <b>presumption</b> in that situation that the driver is not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as sleeping in a car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.|$|E
50|$|Both {{in common}} law and in civil law, <b>a</b> rebuttable <b>presumption</b> (in Latin, praesumptio iuris tantum) is an {{assumption}} {{made by a}} court, one that is taken to be true unless someone comes forward to contest it and prove otherwise. For example, a defendant {{in a criminal case}} is presumed innocent until proved guilty. <b>A</b> rebuttable <b>presumption</b> is often associated with prima facie evidence.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{presumption}}: rebuttable presumption and conclusive <b>presumption.</b> <b>A</b> rebuttable <b>presumption</b> is assumed true until a person proves otherwise (for example the presumption of innocence).

25|$|The trial judge's {{instruction}} {{to the jury}} was improper, as it emphasized <b>a</b> <b>presumption</b> of wrongful intent, rather than concentrating on verifying the defendant's state of mind through evidence and inferences drawn therefrom.

25|$|In 1991, the Supreme Court {{issued the}} most recent (as of early 2008) of its post-Mackay decisions.

25|$|Undue {{influence}} is an equitable doctrine that involves one person {{taking advantage of}} a position of power over another person through a special relationship such as between parent and child or solicitor and client.
