5000|$|A {{disorder}} {{known as}} [...] "Blocq's disease" [...] {{is named after}} him. It {{is also known as}} <b>astasia-abasia,</b> and is characterized by the inability to stand or walk, despite the capability to move ones' lower limbs when sitting or lying down.|$|E
5000|$|Paul Oscar Blocq was {{the first}} to {{describe}} astasis as the inability to maintain an upright posture despite normal function of the legs while sitting. He recognized that paralysis and other deficits could all be observed along with the syndrome <b>astasia-abasia.</b> Jean-Martin Charcot, Charles Lasègue, and other physicians prior to Blocq's description described astasis as [...] "a special variety of motor feebleness of the legs from want of coordination in standing position.” <b>Astasia-abasia</b> is also known as [...] "Blocq's disease". Blocq is credited with diagnosing the first eleven cases and is credited with inventing the chair test for diagnoses. This test involves each patient first walking for 20-30 feet forward then 20-30 feet backward. The patients were then to sit in a swivel chair that had wheels and to push the chair forward and backward. In a follow-up study, these trials were compared with a control group of 9 patients with movement disorders with regard to the gait that were non-psychogenic.|$|E
50|$|Astasis {{has been}} seen in {{patients}} with diverse thalamic lesions, predominantly affecting the posterior lateral region of the brain. It is most frequently accompanied by abasia, although not always. Abasia is a symptom very similar to it and is the inability to walk. The two are most commonly seen in <b>astasia-abasia,</b> which is also called Blocq's disease. It is more common for astasia and abasia to be seen together {{than it is to}} see either one or the other.|$|E
50|$|<b>Astasia-abasia</b> {{refers to}} the {{inability}} to either stand or walk in a normal manner. Astasia {{refers to the}} inability to stand upright unassisted. Abasia refers to lack of motor coordination in walking. The term abasia literally means that the base of gait (the lateral distance between the two feet) is inconstant or unmeasurable. When seen in conversion disorder, the gait is bizarre and is not suggestive of a specific organic lesion: often the patient sways wildly and nearly falls, recovering at the last moment.|$|E
50|$|The fear {{of falling}} (FOF), also {{referred}} to as basophobia (or basiphobia), is a natural fear and is typical of most humans and mammals, in varying degrees of extremity. It differs from acrophobia (the fear of heights), although the two fears are closely related. The {{fear of falling}} encompasses the anxieties accompanying the sensation and the possibly dangerous effects of falling, as opposed to the heights themselves. Those who have little fear of falling may be said to have a head for heights. Basophobia is sometimes associated with <b>astasia-abasia,</b> the fear of walking/standing erect.|$|E
5000|$|Aboulia or abulia (from βουλή, meaning [...] "will", {{with the}} prefix -a), in neurology, {{refers to a}} lack of will or {{initiative}} and {{can be seen as a}} disorder of diminished motivation (DDM). Aboulia falls in the middle of the spectrum of diminished motivation, with apathy being less extreme and akinetic mutism being more extreme than aboulia. A patient with aboulia is unable to act or make decisions independently. It may range in severity from subtle to overwhelming. It is also known as Blocq's disease (which also refers to abasia and <b>astasia-abasia).</b> Aboulia was originally considered to be a disorder of the will.|$|E
40|$|Psychogenic gait {{disorders}} {{can present}} {{in many different}} ways. Among patients with a pure psychogenic gait disorder, buckling of the knee {{is the most common}} feature, followed by <b>astasia-abasia.</b> Here, we describe one such patient with a very unusual gait disturbance that might be regarded as a variant of <b>astasia-abasia.</b> The patient characteristics are described and discussed in a historical context...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Astasia is the {{inability}} to maintain an upright body position without assistance {{in the absence of}} motor weakness or sensory loss. Abasia is described as {{the inability}} to walk or as uncoordinated walking, while preserving mobility of the lower limbs. Ganser syndrome is described as a dissociative disorder characterized by approximate answers, somatic conversion symptoms, clouding of consciousness, as well as visual and auditory pseudohallucinations. The aim {{of this study is to}} present a case that seemed like a combination of neurological and internal disturbances, but actually represented a psychogenic disorder. Case Outline. This paper presents the case of a 13 -year-old patient with the first manifestation of {{the inability to}} walk and stand. Medical history, diagnostic instruments and differential diagnostic methods have been presented in detail. The clinical manifestation was initially interpreted as a neurological disorder. However, after the application of diagnostic procedures and a change in family circumstances, the patient was diagnosed with a psychogenic movement disorder, <b>astasia-abasia,</b> with progressive clinical presentation that included dissociative psychotic reactions (Ganser syndrome). Differential diagnosis as well as the elements of the therapeutic approach have been discussed. Conclusion. Presenting a case of psychogenic <b>astasia-abasia</b> in children contributes to a better understanding and differentiating between conditions with a clinical presentation of signs and symptoms dealt with by other branches of medicine...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the author {{examined}} clinical psychiatric characteristics in 26 {{patients who were}} diagnosed as having Pain Disorder, according to the 4 th edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). The subjects were 7 males and 19 females. At the onset of pain, {{the mean age of}} the patients was 38. 8 years. The most common site of pain was the head, followed by the back, arm, and shoulders. In 18 of the 26 patients, there was no evidence of pathological history at the sites where pain was experienced. The accompanying symptoms were insomnia, anxiety, decrease in appetite, analgesic dependence, depressed mood, and <b>astasia-abasia.</b> The author found that various defense mechanisms were acting in their psychological background and that their whole personality was involved in the occurrence of agony. A physician is required to use pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or situational therapy depending upon patients 2 ̆ 7 conditions and defense mechanisms...|$|E
