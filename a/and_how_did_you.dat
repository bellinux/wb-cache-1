2500|$|In 1979, Colón Sánchez {{expressed}} {{her desire}} to run for a seat as Councilwoman. She {{was supported by the}} Democratic town committee; and endorsed by the mayor, several councilmen, and the Hispanic Democratic Reform Club. Despite all of this support for Colón Sánchez, Councilman Nicholas Carbone, who was a powerful figure in the Democratic political machine, supported Mildred Torres instead.

She wasn't an attractive woman, she was heavy, so where would you take her? How did you sell her? How did you get people to vote for her? <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> get over the prejudice that she spoke with a thick accent? So we didn't take her into a lot of neighborhoods... You had to be practical as you were trying to get her on the school board.” ...|$|E
