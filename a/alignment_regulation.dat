We aimed to test if MTNR 1 B diabetes risk variant rs 10830963 associates with measures of sleep or circadian physiology in intensive inlaboratory protocols (n = 58 – 96) or cross-sectional studies with sleep quantity and quality and timing measures from self-report (n = 4, 307 – 10, 332), actigraphy (n = 1, 513), or polysomnography (n = 3, 021). In the in-laboratory studies, we found a significant association with a substantially longer duration of elevated melatonin levels (41 min) and delayed circadian phase of dim-light melatonin offset (1. 37 h), partially mediated through delayed offset of melatonin synthesis. Furthermore, increased T 2 D risk in MTNR 1 B risk allele carriers was more pronounced in early risers versus late risers as determined by 7 days of actigraphy. Our results provide the surprising insight that the MTNR 1 B risk allele influences dynamics of melatonin secretion, generating a novel hypothesis that the MTNR 1 B risk allele may extend the duration of endogenous melatonin production later into the morning and that early waking may magnify the diabetes risk conferred by the risk allele...|$|R

Thus, after the recent financial and economic crisis these themes are considered necessary to restore confidence in the financial markets, to reformulate the existing corporate governance systems and mechanisms that have been inadequate, and, finally, to rethink the relationship between ethics and economy. The announcement of setting a ceiling on executive remunerations (of financial institutions that receive aid from the government) coincides with the popular disapproval of the plans on the manager incentives. The so-called golden salaries of top managers raised a number of critical questions: considering the present economic recession is it correct award bonuses and privileges to managers? considering the manager-performance ratio is right that managers receive incentives even when the targets are not met?

The reformed South African higher education policies have to guide, rebuild the nation and drive transformation that is necessary in post-apartheid society. However reformation and transformation of regulations require change and restructuring {{in order to ensure}} alignment within the entire system. The Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture (FADA) is positioned in a newly restructured and merged educational landscape within a comprehensive university, in which new strategic goals and objectives have been formulated. The faculty is also {{in the midst of a}} programme offering debate due to the circulation of the draft Higher Education Qualification Framework (HEQF), which revealed the lack of inclusion of previous technikon type qualifications in this framework. FADA is considering recurriculation and conversion from diploma to degree programmes in order to create a competitive advantage, and ensure a postgraduate future for the faculty. However the majority of the FADA academic staff are specifically qualified and experienced in technikon type programme offerings. The aim of this study is therefore; to determine the challenges and expectations presented in reformed state regulation that should be considered in the strategic management of faculty programme offering in order to ensure strategic <b>alignment</b> to state <b>regulation.</b> The primary research objectives of this study are: • To determine the role and impact of reformed state regulation and state policies on the strategic management of the programme offering in FADA. • To establish the challenges and expectations that the faculty face, in order to strategically manage programme offering that is in line with relevant state policy expectations. • To identify and assess the concerns and expectations expressed by FADA academic staff, that will impact on the strategic management and strategic alignment of faculty programme offering. The research design follows a qualitative research approach in order to observe and document the perspective of the academic within higher education. A case study approach is adopted in examining FADA which is a single higher education faculty. Using literature survey, documentary and policy analysis and interviews with academics within the faculty, the study has provided a comprehensive review of higher education state policies. This review also presents the challenges and expectations that will be required within strategic management, of faculty programme offering to ensure strategic <b>alignment</b> to state <b>regulation.</b> The most important findings revealed that greater focus is placed on management in higher education. An increasing move towards a management paradigm is evident in the restructured higher education environment. Furthermore, the reformed higher education system is described as being extremely rigid with an increase in bureaucracy, which relates to the increase in the number of reformed higher education policies and procedures. The increase in policy requirements resulted in a greater administrative workload which impacts on teaching contact time and interaction with students. The research recommendations have identified that FADA should ensure that the faculty management team is experienced and skilled in strategic management and that they include a market orientated approach in strategic planning. FADA should also aim at reducing the negative impact of state regulation on lecturers and ensure that continuous growth and development takes place in the faculty. Ms. M. Clar...|$|R
40|$|MUC 5 AC is a {{well-known}} gastric differentiation marker, which has been frequently used for the classification of stomach cancer. Immunohistochemistry revealed that expression of MUC 5 AC decreases accompanied with increased malignant property of gastric mucosa, which further suggests the importance of MUC 5 AC gene <b>regulation.</b> <b>Alignment</b> of the 5 '-flanking regions of MUC 5 AC gene of 13 mammal species denoted high homology within 200 bp upstream of the coding region. Luciferase activities of the deletion constructs containing upstream 451 bp or shorter fragments demonstrated that 15 bp region between - 111 and - 125 bp plays a critical role on MUC 5 AC promoter activity in gastrointestinal cells. We found a putative Gli-binding site in this 15 bp sequence, and named this region a highly conserved region containing a Gli-binding site (HCR-Gli). Overexpression of Gli homologs (Gli 1, Gli 2, and Gli 3) clearly enhanced MUC 5 AC promoter activity. Exogenous modulation of Gli 1 and Gli 2 also affected the endogenous MUC 5 AC gene expression in gastrointestinal cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Gli 1 directly binds to HCR-Gli: Gli regulates MUC 5 AC transcription via direct protein-DNA interaction. Conversely, in the 30 human cancer cell lines and various normal tissues, expression patterns of MUC 5 AC and Gli did not coincide wholly: MUC 5 AC showed cell line-specific or tissue-specific expression whereas Gli mostly revealed ubiquitous expression. Luciferase promoter assays suggested that the far distal MUC 5 AC promoter region containing upstream 4010 bp seems to have several enhancer elements for gene transcription. In addition, treatments with DNA demethylation reagent and/or histone deacetylase inhibitor induced MUC 5 AC expression in several cell lines that were deficient in MUC 5 AC expression. These results indicated that Gli is necessary but not sufficient for MUC 5 AC expression: namely, the multiple regulatory mechanisms should work in the distal promoter region of MUC 5 AC gene...|$|R
40|$|The key {{hypothesis}} {{of this work}} represented the question, if mimicking the zonal composition and structural porosity of musculoskeletal tissues influences invading cells positively and leads to advantageous results for tissue engineering. Conventional approaches in tissue engineering are limited in producing monolithic “scaffolds” that provide locally variating biological key signals and pore architectures, imitating the alignment of collagenous fibres in bone and cartilage tissues, respectively. In order to fill this gap in available tissue engineering strategies, a new fabrication technique was evolved {{for the production of}} scaffolds to validate the hypothesis. Therefore, a new solidification based platform procedure was developed. This process comprises the directional solidification of multiple flowable precursors that are “cryostructured” to prepare a controlled anisotropic pore structure. Porous scaffolds are attained through ice crystal removal by lyophilisation. Optionally, electrostatic spinning of polymers may be applied to provide an external mesh on top or around the scaffolds. A consolidation step generates monolithic matrices from multi zonal structures. To serve as matrix for tissue engineering approaches or direct implantation as medical device, the scaffold is sterilized. 	 An Adjustable Cryostructuring Device (ACD) was successively developed; individual parts were conceptualized by computer aided design (CAD) and assembled. During optimisation, a significant performance improvement of the ACDs accessible external temperature gradient was achieved, from (1. 3 ± 0. 1) K/mm to (9. 0 ± 0. 1) K/mm. Additionally, four different configurations of the device were made available that enabled the directional solidification of collagenous precursors in a highly controlled manner with various sample sizes and shapes. By using alginate as a model substance the process was systematically evaluated. Cryostructuring diagraphs were analysed yielding solidification parameters, which were associated to pore sizes and alignments that were determined by image processing. Thereby, a precise control over pore size and <b>alignment</b> through electrical <b>regulation</b> of the ACD could be demonstrated. To obtain tissue mimetic scaffolds for the musculoskeletal system, collagens and calcium phosphates had to be prepared to serve as raw materials. Extraction and purification protocols were established to generate collagen I and collagen II, while the calcium phosphates brushite and hydroxyapatite were produced by precipitation reactions. 	 Besides the successive augmentation of the ACD also an optimization of the processing steps was crucial. Firstly, the concentrations and the individual behaviour of respective precursor components had to be screened. Together with the insights gained by videographic examination of solidifying collagen solutions, essential knowledge was gained that facilitated the production of more complex scaffolds. Phenomena of ice crystal growth during cryostructuring were discussed. By evolutionary steps, a cryostructuring of multi-layered precursors with consecutive anisotropic pores could be achieved and successfully transferred from alginate to collagenous precursors. Finally, very smooth interfaces that were hardly detectable by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) could be attained. For the used collagenous systems, a dependency relation between adjustable processing parameters and different resulting solidification morphologies was created. 	 Dehydrothermal-, diisocyanate-, and carbodiimide- based cross linking methods were evaluated, whereby the “zero length” cross linking by carbodiimide was found to be most suitable. Afterwards, a formulation for the cross linking solution was elaborated, which generated favourable outcomes by application inside a reduced pressure apparatus. As a consequence, a pore collapse during wet chemical cross linking could be avoided. 	 Complex monolithic scaffolds featuring continuous pores were fabricated that mimicked structure and respective composition of different areas of native tissues by the presence of biochemical key stimulants. At first, three types of bone scaffolds were produced from collagen I and hydroxyapatite with appropriate sizes to fit critical sized defects in rat femurs. They either featured an isotropic or anisotropic porosity and partly also contained glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Furthermore, meniscus scaffolds were prepared by processing two precursors with biomimetic contents of collagen I, collagen II and GAGs. Here, the pore structures were created under boundary conditions, which allowed an ice crystal growth that was nearly orthogonal to the external temperature gradient. Thereby, the preferential alignment of collagen fibres in the natural meniscus tissue could be mimicked. Those scaffolds owned appropriate sizes for cell culture in well plates or even an authentic meniscus shape and size. Finally, osteochondral scaffolds, sized to either fit well plates or perfusion reactors for cell culture, were fabricated to mimic the composition of subchondral bone and different cartilage zones. Collagen I and the resorbable calcium phosphate brushite were used for the subchondral zone, whereas the cartilage zones were composed out of collagen I, collagen II and tissue mimetic contents of GAGs. The pore structure corresponded to the one that is dominating the volume of natural osteochondral tissue. 	 Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and SEM were used to analyse the composition and pore structure of the individual scaffold zones, respectively. The cross section pore diameters were determined to (65 ± 25) µm, (88 ± 35) µm and(93 ± 42) µm for the anisotropic, the isotropic and GAG containing isotropic bone scaffolds. Furthermore, the meniscus scaffolds showed pore diameters of (93 ± 21) µm in the inner meniscus zone and (248 ± 63) µm inside the outer meniscus zone. Pore sizes of (82 ± 25) µm, (83 ± 29) µm and (85 ± 39) µm were present inside the subchondral, the lower chondral and the upper chondral zone of osteochondral scaffolds. Depending on the fabrication parameters, the respective scaffold zones were also found to feature a specific micro- and nanostructure at their inner surfaces. 	 Degradation studies were carried out under physiological conditions and resulted in a mean mass loss of (0. 52 ± 0. 13) ...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 : An Introduction to the Closed-loop Concept in Industrial Ecology. Abstract - This {{introductory}} chapter {{explains the}} fundamental problem of a linear transformation representation used in operations management (OM) {{to the development of}} environmental sustainability. Linear transformation thinking needs to be replaced by closed-loop system thinking. IE and IS can help to achieve this development. This chapter explores the basic concepts in relation to IE, including biological ecosystem, industrial ecosystem, sub-ecosystems and their interactions with the ecosystem of the Earth. IE considers the development of high level closed-loop industrial ecosystems as its ultimate goal through mimicking key principles of biological ecosystems. An industrial ecosystem needs to work towards high level closed-loop material exchanges and high efficiency of energy cascading. The system boundary is subject to study purposes and extended system thinking should be applied. Keywords: Linear transformation, Closed-loop system, Biological ecosystem, Industrial ecosystem, Industrial Ecology, Industrial Symbiosis Chapter 2 : Industrial Ecology and Industrial Symbiosis - Definitions and Development Histories. Abstract - Various definitions of Industrial Ecology (IE) and Industrial Symbiosis (IS) have been provided in the literature over the past thirty years. These definitions have offered some insights but also confusion due to inconsistency. IE, as an interdisciplinary study field, develops and applies different approaches in its four interrelated areas: industrial ecosystem, IS, industrial metabolism (IM), and environmental legislation and regulations. The ultimate goal of IE is to develop nearly closed-loop industrial ecosystems to enhance environmental sustainability. IS focuses on the development of knowledge webs of novel material, energy and waste exchanges to facilitate the establishment of synergies to support the achievement of this IE goal. The difference between IE and IS lies in the focus, instead of the scale of economy. Keywords: Industrial Ecology, Industrial Symbiosis, Definitions, Development histories, Relationships between Industrial Ecology and Industrial Symbiosis Chapter 3 - Industrial Ecology Applications in the Four Areas. Abstract - Industrial ecology (IE) can be applied in four interrelated study areas: industrial ecosystem, industrial symbiosis (IS), industrial metabolism (IM), and legislation and regulations for IE applications. Different methods can be used to determine the boundary of an industrial ecosystem: material-based, product-based, and geographic-based. IS applications have shifted from a self-organising to planned or facilitated practice. IM establishes its position within IE in quantifying the efficiency and rates of material, waste and energy exchanges over the total corresponding flow to evaluate the closed-loop status of an industrial ecosystem. Legislation and regulations on waste need to reflect the IE’s view of waste as resources. The integration of these four areas is critical for the success of IE applications to fulfil its potential to improve environmental sustainability. Keywords: Applications of Industrial Ecology, Industrial ecosystem boundaries, Self-organised, planned, and facilitated Industrial Symbiosis, Efficiency of resource flows in Industrial Metabolism, Legislation and regulations for Industrial Ecology applications Chapter 4 - Applications of Industrial Symbiosis Abstract - Industrial Symbiosis (IS), a study area within Industrial Ecology (IE), focuses on the knowledge web establishment of novel exchanges for synergies among companies to develop industrial ecosystems. Three types of IS applications have been explored in the literature: regional community-based IS, national IS programmes, and eco-industrial parks (EIPs). These IS applications have offered valuable lessons. Critical success factors drawn from these practices are: an IS coordinating centre, economic and environmental gains in the vision, a large database of knowledge webs for potential symbiotic exchanges, early involvement of participating companies, and government investment at the start. IS applications need not be restricted by geographic proximity. Industrial clusters also need to be transformed into eco-industrial clusters. The transformation requires planned and facilitated IS and long-term vision. Key words: Industrial Symbiosis Applications, Kalundborg Industrial Symbiosis (IS), the UK national IS programme (NISP), Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs), Geographic Proximity, Eco-Industrial Clusters (EICs) Chapter 5 - Life Cycle Thinking and Analysis, Design for Environment, and Industrial Ecology Frameworks. Abstract - This chapter explores the product life cycle, life cycle analytical tools, and design for the environment (DfE) methodology. The product life cycle from an operations management (OM) perspective includes material acquisition, manufacturing, distribution, use, and after-use. DfE explores eco-design options at each stage of this product life cycle to proactively reduce the impact of industrial activities on the environment. This chapter also presents two Industrial Ecology (IE) frameworks, one at a factor level and the other one at a supply chain level. These two frameworks illustrate the importance of integration and collaboration among different parts and parties within and across industrial ecosystems to increase levels of closed-loop material, energy and waste flows, which reduce their interaction with natural systems, hence the reduced impact. Key words: Life cycle thinking/analysis, design for environment (DfE), industrial ecology (IE) frameworks Chapter 6 - Challenges for Applying Industrial Ecology And Industrial Ecology Future Development. Abstract - This chapter explores four challenges for Industrial Ecology (IE) applications: paradigm shift from linear to closed-loop thinking, restriction lift in legislation and regulations on waste, establishment of knowledge webs, and development of symbiotic and recycling networks. Future development of IE is reflected in each of its study areas. In the area of ‘industrial ecosystem’, features and limitations of different types of industrial ecosystems require further exploration and extended system thinking. For IS, development of knowledge webs, symbiotic networks, and infrastructure of end-life-waste collection process are further research agendas. For IM, quantification methods of resource flows in industrial ecosystems require further development. For environmental legislation and <b>regulations,</b> <b>alignment</b> with policy-makers needs to be explored in order to support IE applications on a much larger scale.
