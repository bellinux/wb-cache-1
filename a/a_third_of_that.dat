5|$|Care must {{be taken}} to avoid the {{accumulation}} of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass, particularly because plutonium's critical mass is only <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> of uranium-235. A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays. Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Caliphate's fiscal basis had shrunk {{dramatically}} {{after so many}} tax-paying provinces had been lost from the central government's control. The caliphal government was now increasingly reliant on the revenue of the Sawad and the other areas of lower Iraq, which were witnessing a rapid decline in agricultural productivity due to the disruption of the civil wars and neglect of the irrigation network. In the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786–809) the Sawad had provided an annual revenue of 102,500,000 dirhams, {{more than double the}} revenue of Egypt and three times that of Syria; by the early 10th century it was providing less than <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> figure. The situation was further exacerbated by {{the fact that in the}} remaining provinces, semi-autonomous governors, grandees and members of the dynasty were able to establish virtual latifundia, aided by the system of muqāṭa'a, a form of tax farming in exchange for a fixed tribute, which they often failed to pay. To maximise their revenue from the territory remaining to them, the Abbasids increased the breadth and complexity of the central bureaucracy, dividing the provinces into smaller tax districts as well as increasing the number of the fiscal departments (dīwāns), allowing for close oversight of both revenue collection and the activities of the officials themselves.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{recorded}} {{population for}} Shapinsay is 974, in 1881. Since then, {{the population of}} the island has steadily declined; less than <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> number was recorded in the 2001 census. The rate of absolute population loss was lower in the last decades of the 20th century {{than it had been in}} the first half of that century. In 2001, Shapinsay had a population of 300, a decline of 6.8% from 322 in 1991. This was greater than the population decline for Orkney overall in the same period, which was 1.9%. However, the loss in population on Shapinsay was less than that experienced by most Orkney islands, most of which experienced declines of more than 10%. The number of persons per hectare on Shapinsay was 0.1, similar to the 0.2 persons per hectare across Orkney. At the time of the 2011 census the usually resident population had increased to 307. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E

5|$|To {{resist the}} Vietnamese {{occupation}} of Kampuchea and the regime which they installed, the Khmer Rouge {{called on the}} Kampuchean people to unite and fight the Vietnamese. However, due to the brutality which they had experienced under the deposed regime, many Kampucheans believed that any political movement aimed at restoring national freedom must oppose both the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese. In response to such preconditions, two non-communist movements were formed to fight the Vietnamese occupation. The first group, a right-wing and pro-Western organisation, was formed in October 1979 by former Prime Minister Son Sann and was called the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF). The KPNLF operated from several refugee camps on the Thai-Cambodian border, where it controlled thousands of civilians. At its peak, the armed branch of the KPNLF were estimated to have between 12,000 and 15,000 fighters, but <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> number were lost through fighting and desertions during the Vietnamese dry season offensive of 1984–85. Nonetheless, the KPNLF continued to operate in small groups, harassing the Vietnamese and their Kampuchean allies using guerrilla tactics.|$|E

25|$|The {{first half}} of the 20th century saw Scottish {{universities}} fall behind those in England and Europe in terms of participation and investment.

English universities increased the numbers of students registered between 1924 and 1927 by 19 per cent, but in Scotland the numbers fell, particularly among women.

25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{marriage}}s in Comoros, the Mna dabo (little marriage) and the ada (grand marriage). The little marriage is a simple legal marriage. It is small, intimate, and inexpensive. The bride price is nominal. The little marriage, however, is just a placeholder until the couple can afford the ada, or grand marriage. The hallmarks of the grand marriage are dazzling gold jewelry, two weeks of celebration and an enormous bride price. The groom must pay most of the expenses for this event, and the bride’s family typically pays only <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> of the groom’s. The grand wedding can cost up to £55,000. Many men cannot afford this until their late 40's, if ever.|$|E
25|$|Victoria, who had {{qualified}} for the Twenty20 Big Bash final three days earlier, had Allan Wise take five wickets when they hosted the Sri Lankans at the Central Reserve in Glen Waverley, Melbourne. After rain had proceedings delayed early on, and reduced each team's innings to 40 overs, Wise got a wicket in his opening over, and continued to end with figures of 8–2–25–5. Seven of the conceded runs were due to wides. When Wise had his final wicket – that of Chamara Kapugedera – the Sri Lankans were six for 57, and though Kumar Sangakkara put on 43 with Farveez Maharoof for the seventh wicket, the total was still 120. Nearly <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> was due to extras, as 25 wides and eight leg-byes were conceded by Victoria.

25|$|In California, Mourvèdre {{reached the}} United States in the 1860s {{as part of}} the Pellier {{collection}} and was likely first planted in Santa Clara County. The variety, known as Mataro, was widely planted in anonymous field blends that was used primarily for bulk produced jug wines. From the middle of the 20th century, it saw its plantings rapidly decline from more than 2700 acres in 1968 to less than <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> by the 2000s.

25|$|Having {{consolidated}} their {{rule over}} South Africa in 1815, the British found a ready supply of wine now firmly within their control. Since {{losing control of}} the Aquitaine and Bordeaux nearly 350 years earlier, securing {{a steady stream of}} wine for the British market had been a pressing concern for the British. By this point the wines of Constantia had become world-renowned; enthusiastic patrons across the globe included Napoleon (who requested several cases for his exile on St-Helena) and the restored French King Louis-Philippe I. American merchants gladly traded their slaves for the famous South African wine. The British public were greatly encouraged by a reduction in import duty on South African wine to <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> imposed on Portuguese wine, which had enjoyed favorable duty rates due to the Methuen Treaty. With easy access to the lucrative British market, the South African wine industry experienced a period of prosperity that would last until the middle of the 19th century.|$|E

One of the most important discoveries at the site has been the cuneiform royal archives of clay tablets, consisting of official correspondence and contracts, as well as legal codes, procedures for cult ceremony, oracular prophecies and literature of the ancient near east. Although the thirty-thousand or so clay tablets recovered from Ḫattuša form the main corpus of Hittite literature, archives have since appeared at other centres in Anatolia, such as Tabigga and Sapinuwa.|$|E
