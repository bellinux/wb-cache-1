With the founding of Sanctuary Records, an independent record label Idol felt positive <b>about,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> formation of a new band with Steve Stevens, Idol decided to produce Devil's Playground. Idol's later album featured a more power pop and classic rock sound similar to Idol's 80s style, and received middling reviews.|$|E

In a pincer movement, McCudden hooked into an assault {{from the right}} while his wingman, Lieutenant Arthur Rhys Davids, swooped in from the left. Muspratt trailed them down, while Cronyn brought up the rear. Jeffs and Young held high as top cover in case Voss climbed. He was now boxed in from above and below, with assailants pouncing from either side. To further worsen Voss's situation, there was a British fighter patrol beneath him.|$|E

That element was destroyed by lightning in 1942. It was replaced in 1957 by a figure of Victory by Oskar J. W. Hansen.

25|$|The growing {{importance}} of EcM fungi {{in the field}} of conservation is evidenced by the creation of the Northwest Forest Plan, which offers guidelines to maintain habitats and endangered species. This includes creating databases for endangered fungi and developing strategies to manage and protect them. Another example in a similar vein is the creation of the European Council for the Conservation of Fungi, which works with education <b>about,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> documentation of, endangered fungi on the continent. Organizations and groups like these are valuable in disseminating knowledge concerning conservation practices for scientists and the public. They also help compile solutions for fields like forest management that act to preemptively halt EcM declines.|$|E
25|$|It {{was soon}} noticed by the troops that the Charleston {{expected}} a fight, since the cruiser began firing subcaliber ammunition at boxes tossed from the City of Peking.

25|$|The United States Congress {{passed the}} Embargo Act of 1807, and {{prohibited}} {{the importation of}} slaves in 1808. That same year Fernandina was declared a free port; it began to ship great quantities of Florida cotton and lumber, and became a resort for the smuggling business and contraband slave trade. The town entered a boom period of extraordinary growth, with finer residences and crude shacks springing up next to each other. Vegetable gardens were planted haphazardly <b>about,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> streets {{were little more than}} crooked paths. The unsightly and unsanitary condition of Fernandina disturbed Governor White, and on May 10, 1811, two days after Clarke's appointment as surveyor general, he instructed him to plat the town so that the streets were properly aligned and the lots were uniform.|$|E
25|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this approach}} is that it is trivial, based on the trivial observation that mathematics is a human activity. To observe that rigorous proof comes only after unrigorous conjecture, experimentation and speculation is true, but it is trivial and no-one would deny this. So it's a bit of a stretch to characterize a philosophy of mathematics in this way, on something trivially true. The calculus of Leibniz and Newton was reexamined by mathematicians such as Weierstrass in order to rigorously prove the theorems thereof. There is nothing special or interesting about this, as it fits in with the more general trend of unrigorous ideas which are later made rigorous. There needs to be a clear distinction between the objects of study of mathematics and the study of the objects of study of mathematics. The former doesn't seem to change a great deal; the latter is forever in flux. The latter is what the social theory is <b>about,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> former is what Platonism et al. are about.|$|E
25|$|The C-5 was {{confirmed}} as NASA's {{choice for the}} Apollo program in early 1963, and was named the SaturnV. The C-1 became the Saturn I, and C-1B became Saturn IB. Von Braun headed a team at the Marshall Space Flight Center in building a vehicle capable of launching a manned spacecraft on a trajectory to the Moon. Before they moved under NASA's jurisdiction, von Braun's team had already begun work on improving the thrust, creating a less complex operating system, and designing better mechanical systems. It was during these revisions {{that the decision to}} reject the single engine of the V-2's design came <b>about,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> team moved to a multiple-engine design. The Saturn I and IB reflected these changes, but were not large enough to send a manned spacecraft to the Moon. These designs, however, provided a basis for which NASA could determine its best method towards landing a man on the Moon.|$|E

25|$|Calder {{then moved}} south to intercept, while Villeneuve {{assembled}} his force into {{the line of}} battle and began moving north. The two fleets moved slowly past each other, before Calder came about by tacking in succession and began to close on the enemy's rear. The action eventually began when the frigate , in the van of the British fleet, attempted to attack the French frigate SirÃ©ne, trailing in the rear. Fearing the British were attempting to cut off his rear, Villeneuve brought his fleet <b>about</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Spanish van opened fire on the leading British ships at about 5.30pm. The action quickly became general, but in the failing light, mist and gunsmoke both fleets soon became scattered. By the time the action broke off at 9.30pm, two Spanish ships had been isolated and captured. Both fleets were still scattered the following day. They continued to observe each other, but neither made an attempt to resume the action, and despite more favourable winds on 24 July, Calder declined to give battle. By 25 July the fleets had drifted {{out of sight of}} each other, at which point Villeneuve sailed south to Vigo, while Calder headed east. Both admirals claimed a victory, with Villeneuve assuring Napoleon that he intended to sail north to rendezvous with Allemand's force from Rochefort, before heading to the Channel.|$|E
25|$|The police {{made several}} {{mistakes}} in {{the handling of the}} case, especially in overlooking the remains of Christie's previous murder victims left in the garden at Rillington Place; one femur was later found propping up a fence. The garden of the property was very small, <b>about</b> , <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fence was parallel to the wash-house where the bodies of Beryl and Geraldine were later found. Several searches were made at the house after Evans confessed to placing his wife's remains in the drains, but the wash-house was not entered at any point by the three policemen conducting the search. The garden was apparently examined but was not excavated at this point. Christie later admitted that his dog had unearthed the skull of Muriel Eady in the garden shortly after these police searches, which he simply threw into an abandoned bombed-out house in nearby St. Marks Road. There was clearly no systematic search made of the crime scene in which this or other human remains would have been found, and pointed to Christie as the perpetrator. Several police searches of the property showed a complete lack of expertise in handling forensic evidence and were quite superficial, at best. Had the searches been conducted effectively, the investigation would have exposed Christie as a murderer, and the lives of four women, as well as Evans', would have been saved.|$|E
25|$|The Loire {{changed its}} course, due to tectonic deformations, from the {{original}} outfall into the English Channel to its new outfall into the Atlantic Ocean thereby creating the presently seen narrow terrain of gorges, the Loire Valley with alluvium formations and the long stretch of beaches along the Atlantic Ocean. The river {{can be divided into}} three main zones; the Upper Loire which is the area from the source to the confluence with the Allier, the middle Loire Valley which is the area from the Allier to the confluence with the Maine, <b>about</b> , <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lower Loire which is the area from Maine to the estuary. In the upper basin the river flows through a narrow, incised valley, marked by gorges and forests on the edges and a distinct low population. In the intermediate section, the alluvial plain broadens and the river meanders and forks into multi-channels. River flow is particularly high in the river area near Roanne and Vichy up to the confluence with the Allier. In the middle section of the river in the Loire Valley, numerous dikes built between the 12th and 19th century exist, providing mitigation against flooding. In this section the river is relatively straight, except for the area near OrlÃ©ans and numerous sand banks and islands exist. The lower course of the river is characterized by wetlands and fens, which are of major importance to conservationists given that they form unique habitats for migratory birds.|$|E
