5|$|The {{crash of}} Flight 111 was a severe blow to Swissair. Ironically, the IFE {{system on the}} {{aircraft}} that was blamed for causing the accident was installed by Swissair to <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> passengers in order to ease the airline's financial difficulties. Swissair finally went bankrupt shortly after the 9/11 attack in 2001, which caused a powerful disruption to the aviation transportation industry.|$|E
5|$|To {{stem the}} loss of {{passengers}} and resulting deficits, the B in the early 1960s offered reduced mid-week fares, auto shipment for passengers (similar in concept to the Auto Train), and onboard movies, to <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> passengers. The train was marginally profitable, when mail and express revenue was included.|$|E

5|$|As {{the fields}} of ecology and {{environmental}} studies develop, exotic species <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> attention and their effects become more apparent. Mid-20th century biology texts about invading species reflected more complacency than alarm, as contemporary wisdom about them assumed the host environment would be largely immune. Everglades biologist Thomas Lodge writes that in the 1960s, evidence of non-native plant and animal life in South Florida was present but not particularly worthy of notice. Over the past decades, however, the number of exotic species and their spread has increased dramatically.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1952–53 season, the New South Wales Cricket Association's five-man {{selection}} panel installed Miller as captain in place of Morris. This was despite Morris leading the state to the Sheffield Shield in the previous season. Miller did not lobby for the job, but the Sydney media had campaigned for Miller, suggesting that his flamboyant style would <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> spectators and help stem the financial losses of the NSWCA. Despite this, Morris remained the Test vice-captain ahead of Miller.|$|E
5|$|FreeStyleGames {{selected}} on-disc {{songs from}} {{a wider variety}} of music genres beyond rock music as to provide challenging guitar tracks for players, while their approach to licensing of songs for GHTV enabled them to <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> musical acts to offer their music. Game reviewers found the on-disc soundtrack to be weak as it focused too much on more recent musical acts, while praising the wider variety across a larger time period that GHTV offered.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an ambulance before they can be seen. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the ambulance. Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which ambulance operators can use to <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in heavy traffic.|$|E
5|$|Judge Judy has {{maintained}} preeminence within its genre. Since its debut, {{it has remained}} the No. 1 rated court show and regularly draws approximately 9 to 10 million viewers daily.

25|$|More {{available}} {{jobs in the}} cigar industry <b>attracted</b> <b>more</b> residents. Cigar workers found ready employment in the ever-growing number of large factories and small storefront shops (“buckeyes”) and came in ever-growing numbers. More immigration meant more amenities such as {{a wider range of}} businesses and more opportunities for social and cultural events, which in turn <b>attracted</b> <b>more</b> new residents, which <b>attracted</b> <b>more</b> businesses, etc. This cycle of growth lasted until the late 1920s, by which time Ybor City was home to hundreds of cigar making businesses {{and tens of thousands of}} permanent residents and had a thriving cultural scene.|$|R

5|$|Like Williams, Smith {{knew the}} Mad Dogs would face {{an uphill battle}} {{attracting}} fans once the traditional American football season started. As {{was the case in}} Birmingham, Smith persuaded the CFL to let them play their late-season home games on Sundays to avoid competing against high school and Tennessee/Ole Miss football. It was to no avail; late in the season the Mad Dogs struggled to <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> than 10,000 people. Like Williams, Smith publicly blamed community apathy and media hostility for the lackluster attendance. The team went 9–9 in their only year.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} of Akihabara in Tokyo, {{where there are}} maid cafes featuring waitresses who dress up and act like maids or anime characters, is a notable attraction center for otaku. Akihabara also has dozens of stores specializing in anime, manga, retro video games, figurines, card games and other collectibles. Another popular location is Otome Road in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. In Nagoya, students from Nagoya City University started a project on ways to help promote hidden tourist attractions related to the otaku culture to <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> otaku to the city.|$|E
5|$|When {{hiding in}} the dark is a {{gameplay}} element, light and shadow become important parts of the level design. Usually the player is able to disable certain light sources. Stealth games also emphasize the audio design when players {{must be able to}} hear the subtle sound effects that may alert enemies to their actions; noise will often vary as the player walks on different surfaces such as wood or metal. Players who move recklessly will make more noise and <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> attention.|$|E

5|$|Governor Crittenden {{resigned}} on July 31, 1850 {{to accept}} President Millard Fillmore's appointment as attorney general, and Helm ascended to the governorship. As governor, Helm vetoed a legislative plan to cover deficits {{in the public}} school fund by drawing money from the state's sinking fund, but the General Assembly overrode the veto. He urged the legislature to fund a survey of the state's mineral reserves and a census of the state's agricultural and manufacturing resources. He called for spending on internal improvements and for raising judges' salaries to <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> qualified jurists to the bench. He also sought a ban on the carrying of concealed deadly weapons. The legislature did not act on any of these proposed reforms. The only part of Helm's agenda that did progress through the General Assembly was election reform.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, SAS {{announced}} {{that it was going to}} reduce its commission to travel agents from 9 to 5%. Braathens followed, reducing from 8 to 5% from 1 January 1998. However, to try to <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> business passengers, the airline retained the 8% commission on their international routes. At the same time, the Government of Norway abandoned its old regime of negotiating prices with the airlines for state-employed civil servants' flights. Instead, they introduced an annual tender for the routes. It was awarded to SAS, who also won all subsequent tenders. For Braathens SAFE, this meant that state-employed civil servants only flew on routes where SAS did not fly. The contract was worth NOK500 million for SAS.|$|E
5|$|O'Donoghue complained {{directly}} to Belushi {{that he thought}} his parody of Shatner during the dress rehearsals was inadequate and needed much improvement. Further, actor Chevy Chase was annoyed that he was satirizing Leonard Nimoy as Spock; {{he did not like}} the idea of playing second-fiddle to Belushi. During all of the rehearsals, Chase attempted to <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> attention to his character's role and dominate the scene. Just prior to the actual on-air performance of the sketch, O'Donoghue admonished Belushi and implored him to perform an effective parody. Belushi's dress rehearsal performance had worried executives so much that they had discussed canceling the entire sketch altogether.|$|E
