5|$|However, it {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that single-story structures such as mobile homes can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll <b>a</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting <b>a</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E

5|$|Rainfall up to 5in (127mm) in Massachusetts {{caused a}} river in Somerset to {{overflow}} its banks, flooding nearby areas with 2feet (0.6m) of water. A large sinkhole formed on County Street and several cars were {{stranded in the}} floodwaters. Two people had to be rescued by boat when their car was overcome by the floodwaters. In addition, numerous basements were flooded. Damages in Bristol County were estimated at $25,000. <b>A</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> park in Plymouth County was inundated with 2.5ft (0.7m) of water, causing one home to shift off its foundation. Damages to the homes were estimated at $50,000.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{crossed the}} Ohio River {{a third time}} back into Indiana and across the {{southern}} fringes of Evansville. Here, the tornado ripped directly through the Eastbrook Mobile Home Park, obliterating numerous mobile homes and killing 20 people. Of about 350 mobile homes in the park, 100 were destroyed and another 125 were damaged. The coroner reported {{that most of the}} victims were probably killed instantly, many by spine and skull fractures. Several bodies were carried almost two hundred yards. The tornado then crossed into Warrick County, Indiana at the Angel Mounds State Historic Site. Several permanent homes were destroyed in this area, along with many others {{on the north side of}} Newburgh. Past Newburgh, the tornado reached its peak intensity (high-end F3) as it tore through an industrial park near Paradise. Further northeast, the tornado passed just south of Boonville and caused a fatality in <b>a</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>home.</b> The tornado then tore directly through the small community of DeGonia Springs, tossing vehicles and destroying homes.

5|$|Twelve tornadoes were {{reported}} during Fay's landfall; {{the most notable}} one destroyed <b>a</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>home,</b> and damaged a barn. Heavy rain from Fay's remnants also dropped 23inches (50–75mm) of rain over Frio County. Rainfall of 8inches (200mm) was reported near the Atascosca County line with an isolated report of 12inches (300mm) in other areas. The rainfall caused severe flashflooding which forced people to flee to roof tops. Damage to buildings, roads and crops totaled up to $800,000 (2002USD; $940,0002007USD).|$|E
5|$|With {{most of its}} {{circulation}} {{over the}} western portion of Florida during its existence, Tropical Storm Marco produced 39–74mph winds across western Florida. As it brushed the coastline, the storm developed strong convective rain bands, leading to peak sustained winds of 69mph (112km/h) with gusts to 85mph (137km/h) on the Sunshine Skyway Bridge; the bridge was closed after gusts reached 70mph (115km/h). Squalls from the storm spawned four tornadoes in the state, one of which struck the city of Crystal River, destroying <b>a</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> and left 2,000people without power for about an hour. Storm damage left about 25,000customers across the state without power and about 40families temporarily homeless.|$|E

He extended the concept by creating Famiglia Grande, a series of transformable cases. In 2009, Wong attended the Subvision Festival in Hamburg as a skyscraper.|$|E
5|$|The SJTA {{revealed}} {{plans for}} a major road improvement project that would link the Atlantic City International Airport directly to the Atlantic City Expressway, with construction beginning as early as 2013. The plan includes new ramps with two overpasses over the expressway. The road would connect Amelia Earhart Boulevard with an overpass above Airport Circle. Plans also call for building a service road with another overpass that would provide access to Delilah Road. Another project involves the installation of an overpass {{at the end of}} Amelia Earhart Boulevard next to the entrance to the FAA tech center.

5|$|The storm dropped {{moderate}} rainfall in Vermont, {{including a}} total of 5.73inches (141mm) in Mays Mill. The rainfall caused road washouts, landslides, and damage to bridges in the southeast portion of the state. The center of Tropical Storm Doria passed over south-central New Hampshire, resulting in heavy rains and damaging winds. Sustained winds in Maine were generally around 30mph (48km/h), while gusts peaked at 61mph (98km/h) in Lewiston. The strong winds resulted in downed trees and widespread outages to power and telephone service. The winds also damaged <b>a</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> in Sabattus and a steel shed in Lewiston. Doria produced moderate rainfall, including {{a total of}} 1.75inches (44mm) in Lewiston, though little flooding occurred.|$|E
5|$|In Coffee County, local {{officials}} reported wind gusts had blown a carport {{into a wall}} of a house. Marengo County received moderate damage, mostly limited to power outages and minor roof and structural damage caused by fallen trees and powerlines. Many customers were without electric power {{for at least a}} day, and numerous county roads were covered with debris. A person was injured in Dallas County when a tree landed on their car. Five homes and one business were damaged due to high winds, and thousands of people county-wide experienced power outages. Greene County reported hundreds of downed trees and powerlines causing County Roads 148 and 20 and State Highways 11, 43 and 14 to be temporarily closed. In Forkland, <b>a</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> caught fire when a powerline fell on the home. A motorist ran into a fallen tree in Boligee although did not sustain injuries. In Perry County, 2,200homes were without electric power for several hours, and several vehicles and homes were damaged.

5|$|In Sarasota County, the {{flooding}} closed several roads {{and led to}} many overflown creeks and rivers, including the Horse Creek which crested at 5.8feet (1.8m) above flood level. Damage to roads and bridges totaled about $1million. Due to the flat landscape of the region, {{the flooding}} persisted for several days. The depression spawned a tornado in <b>a</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> park in Nokomis, destroying the roofs of fivehomes and causing leaks in twelveothers. Throughout the area, {{the passage of the}} depression left about 45,000customers without power, primarily due to gusty winds. The outages were fairly short-lived due to power companies calling in extra workers to restore the power. Moderate winds toppled a construction crane at the northern end of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, closing the bridge for 35minutes before the crane was removed. In Pinellas County, a man hydroplaned while driving along a flooded roadway; he crashed into a concrete pole and was killed. Severe crop damage to orange trees was reported in association with the flooding. Damage from the depression totaled over $2.6million (1992USD, $4million 2008USD), with about4,000houses affected by the flooding and an additional 70destroyed. Twopeople were killed in Florida.|$|E

5|$|Russell Bryan was an {{enrolled}} {{member of}} the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, which is a component band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. He married Helen Charwood in 1957. Helen was an enrolled {{member of the}} Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, which was {{also a part of}} the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. They raised their children on reservation land and lived in <b>a</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> which they purchased in 1971. The mobile home was located on the Greater Leech Lake Indian Reservation near Squaw Lake in Itasca County, Minnesota. Bryan's mobile home, had it not been on the reservation, would have been subject to taxes from Itasca County. In June 1972, Itasca County notified Bryan that the mobile home was subject to US$147.95 in taxes. The Bryans could not afford to pay the tax, and contacted the Leech Lake Reservation Legal Services Project (Legal Services) for help, noting that the mobile home was on Indian land.|$|E
5|$|The falling trees downed {{power lines}} and poles, causing power outages and some {{property}} damage due to the trees and poles hitting houses. One indirect fatality occurred when a motorist drove into a downed tree. Two other vehicles in Franklin County and a fire truck in York were hit and greatly damaged by trees. Downed wires set a Family Dollar on fire in Paradise Township and was believed to have started a fire in a church in Ringtown. Falling trees hit at least eleven houses, with one tree severely damaging <b>a</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>home</b> in Bellwood. Damage directly from the wind was generally minor, and included a house losing a chimney in Camp Hill, a carport being blown over in New Oxford, and at least four houses reporting roof or siding damage. The hurricane also damaged corn fields near Lancaster. Downed trees closed or disrupted traffic on at least 56roads in the region, including U.S. Routes 6 and 322, as well as Interstate 83 in York County.|$|E
5|$|The storm then {{crossed the}} Tennessee state line at 8:28p.m. EDT (0028 UTC), {{and moved into}} Hamilton County, Tennessee, {{striking}} {{the small town of}} Apison at high-end EF4 strength, where multiple large homes were leveled or swept away, 150 others were damaged, and thousands of trees were snapped and uprooted. The tornado then crossed into Bradley County at low-end EF4 strength, moving across the southern and eastern fringes of Cleveland and affecting mainly residential areas, though a few businesses were damaged or destroyed as well. Subdivisions {{in the southern part of}} the city sustained major damage, with numerous houses destroyed and a few that were leveled. Four people were killed in Cleveland, and many others were injured. Several trees were felled in Polk County (as the tornado had weakened to EF1-strength), before the tornado crossed into McMinn County.
