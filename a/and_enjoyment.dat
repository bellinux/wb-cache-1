5|$|Krishna's {{childhood}} {{illustrates the}} Hindu concept of lila, playing for fun <b>and</b> <b>enjoyment</b> {{and not for}} sport or gain. His interaction with the gopis at the rasa dance or Rasa-lila is an example. Krishna plays his flute and the gopis come immediately, from whatever they were doing, to {{the banks of the}} Yamuna River, and join him in singing and dancing. Even those who could not physically be there join him through meditation. He is the spiritual essence and the love-eternal in existence, the gopis metaphorically represent the prakṛti matter and the impermanent body.|$|E

30|$|Mediation {{analysis}} for the full sample indicates substantial positive relations between (a) teachers’ work <b>enjoyment</b> <b>and</b> teaching characteristics, and between (b) teaching characteristics <b>and</b> students’ <b>enjoyment</b> of lessons. Still, crossover of activity-related emotions cannot be empirically established. Moderator analyses reveal that crossover occurrence is not a function of training type. However, positive relations between teaching characteristics <b>and</b> students’ <b>enjoyment</b> vary in strength across the three contrasted vocational domains, and {{the same applies to}} positive associations between teachers’ <b>enjoyment</b> <b>and</b> teaching characteristics. Consequently, crossover effects are demonstrable only in commercial classes. The paper therefore discusses methodological issues, further research needs and practical implications.|$|R
