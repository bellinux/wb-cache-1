5|$|The very {{expensive}} project of 1910, costing Coandă about one million francs, {{left him with}} limited funds. The possibility of a new contract with the French government led Coandă to build the Coandă-1911. He wished to win an army-organised competition at Reims in October, one that required two engines in each aircraft as a fail-safe strategy. At the third aviation salon in Paris 1911, Coandă displayed a scale model of the aircraft which used two Gnome rotary engines mounted back to back, connected by <b>a</b> <b>bevel</b> gear to a single two-bladed propeller. The combination of two engines connected to one propeller was originally intended to drive a new turbine, but Coandă was unable to fund one. During trials the assembly did not provide enough traction and a four-bladed propeller was ordered. The mounting support of the engines, initially intended for a jet propulsion version, was not adequate for the new configuration so the forward chassis had to be modified.|$|E

25|$|The rotor {{is turned}} by the wind, and through <b>a</b> <b>bevel</b> wheel drives a shaft inside the column (if used) {{or in the}} centre of the tower. At the lower end this drives a {{horizontal}} shaft through a gearbox, which typically drives three throw pump.|$|E

50|$|Among {{the pottery}} {{exhibits}} is an alabaster, with alternating black and off-white slip in a wavy pattern, <b>a</b> <b>bevelled</b> jug with spiral motives, and a pithoid jar decorated with schematic ivy leaves.

50|$|Zerol <b>bevel</b> gears are <b>an</b> {{intermediate}} type between {{straight and}} spiral bevel gears. Their teeth are curved, but not angled. Zerol bevel gears {{are designed with}} the intent of duplicating the characteristics of <b>a</b> straight <b>bevel</b> gear but they are produced using <b>a</b> spiral <b>bevel</b> cutting process.|$|R
25|$|This {{opening on}} the end of the north wing {{consists}} of a full width, battened door bearing four vertical, recessed panels similar to the south door. The frame and brickwork surrounding it are probably reworked. This is especially evident in the brick framing on the top that is now a simple course of Flemish bond. The wooden door frame consists of three sets of flat boards, becoming progressively narrower toward the doorway. There is <b>a</b> <b>bevel</b> between the outermost frame member and a semi-round molding between the two inner boards. Both the north and south doors are secured by strap hinges on the inside.|$|E

2500|$|In {{rear-wheel drive}} {{automobiles}} the central drive shaft (or prop shaft) engages the differential through a hypoid gear(ring and pinion). The ring gear {{is mounted on}} the carrier of the planetary chain that forms the differential. [...] This hypoid gear is <b>a</b> <b>bevel</b> gear that changes {{the direction of the}} drive rotation.|$|E
60|$|A flagged terrace of rounded stones {{with a list}} of two {{or three}} inches to port had been laid round the {{south-east}} and south-west sides of the house, and ran with <b>a</b> <b>bevelled</b> edge into mould, which was in preparation for being turfed; along this terrace James led the way.|$|R
50|$|Dunhill Light {{cigarettes}} are packaged {{in a predominantly}} white packet, with <b>a</b> <b>bevelled</b> edged square of red in the centre. Dunhill has decided to phase out this pack and have introduced marketing information that the blue box described below is the same cigarette although carbon monoxide levels and nicotine levels are altered.|$|R
50|$|Played at the St Gissop School, West Sussex, {{this version}} {{is similar to}} Eton Fives except that <b>a</b> <b>bevelled</b> stone 'balustrade' {{features}} three feet and three inches above {{the floor of the}} tangential wall of the court. The game was supposedly invented by alumnus George Henry Steering, who excelled at the game.|$|R
2500|$|Mild to {{moderate}} cases are often treated conservatively {{with warm water}} and epsom salt soaks, antibacterial ointment {{and the use of}} dental floss. If conservative treatment of a minor ingrown toenail does not succeed, or if the ingrown toenail is severe, surgical treatment may be required. A [...] "gutter splint" [...] may be improvised by slicing a cotton-tipped wooden applicator diagonally to form <b>a</b> <b>bevel</b> and using this to insert a wisp of cotton from the applicator head under the nail to lift it from the underlying skin after a foot soak.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to crown lengthening {{to establish a}} proper biologic width, a 2mm height of tooth structure {{should be available to}} allow for a ferrule effect. [...] A ferrule, in respect to teeth, is a band that encircles the external dimension of residual tooth structure, not unlike the metal bands that exist around a barrel. [...] Sufficient vertical height of tooth structure that will be grasped by the future crown is necessary to allow for a ferrule effect of the future prosthetic crown; it has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of fracture in the endodontically treated tooth.. J Prosthet Dent 61:676, 1989. [...] Because beveled tooth structure is not parallel to the vertical axis of the tooth, it does not properly contribute to ferrule height; thus, a desire to bevel the crown margin by 1mm would require an additional 1mm of bone removal in the crown lengthening procedure. [...] Frequently, however, restorations are performed without such <b>a</b> <b>bevel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{structure was}} also wood; slab sided and plywood-covered. [...] From the side the nose was rectangular, {{but it was}} rounded in plan, rather {{like that of the}} Vickers Vimy. [...] The front gunner 's position was slightly back from the nose, with the pilot's cockpit just behind it and well in front of the wings. [...] A rear gunner's cockpit was placed at the trailing edge of the high set upper wing. [...] Both gunners' cockpits were fitted with Scarff rings. [...] The 450hp Napier Lion engine, a water-cooled unit with 12 cylinders in W or broad arrow arrangement was placed at the centre of gravity inside the fuselage, though with its cylinder heads exposed. [...] There was a radiator {{on each side of the}} fuselage near the trailing edge; unusually, these were hinged so that they could be adjusted in flight more or less directly into the slipstream as the pilot chose. [...] The Lion was mounted in line with the fuselage, with its output close to the leading edge of the middle wing, where <b>a</b> <b>bevel</b> gear transmitted the power via drive shafts to gears behind the propellers. [...] The propellers counter-rotated at low speeds.|$|E
50|$|In {{the churchyard}} is {{the base of}} a medieval cross dating from around 1298 or later. It is in red {{sandstone}} and consists of a two-step base on top of which is <b>a</b> <b>bevelled</b> block. This holds a short Tuscan column on the top of which are the fixings for a sundial. It is listed at Grade II, and is a scheduled monument.|$|R

50|$|The {{retaining}} wall stepping {{down from the}} southern {{side of the bridge}} supports flights of stairs alternating with gentle ramps. The stonework is finished to the profile of the stairs and ramps and capped with concrete. The capping, in turn, supports a balustrade of solid concrete panels spanning between stonework piers. Like the piers on the bridge itself, these consist of Brisbane Tuff ashlaring with <b>a</b> <b>bevelled</b> capping piece.|$|R
50|$|The Swiss Army Knife is {{an example}} of a knife with <b>a</b> primary <b>bevel</b> and <b>an</b> edge <b>bevel.</b> By contrast, <b>a</b> blade {{composed}} of a single flat grind from stock thickness to the cutting edge is known as a 'full flat ground' blade. The cutting properties of a blade are determined by the type of metal, the hardness of the blade, and the grinding pattern (e.g. convex, concave, teardrop).|$|R

5000|$|Double bevel or {{compound}} <b>bevel</b> — <b>A</b> back <b>bevel,</b> {{similar to}} <b>a</b> sabre or flat grind, {{is put on}} the blade behind the edge bevel (the bevel which is the foremost cutting surface). This back bevel keeps the section of blade behind the edge thinner which improves cutting ability. Being less acute at the edge than <b>a</b> single <b>bevel,</b> sharpness is sacrificed for resilience: such a grind is much less prone to chipping or rolling than <b>a</b> single <b>bevel</b> blade. This profile is commonly found in Japanese swords, such as the familiar katana. The shape of the bevel is much more efficient in reducing drag than the sabre grind typically found on Western sword blades. In practice, double bevels are common {{in a variety of}} edge angles and back bevel angles, and Western kitchen knives generally have <b>a</b> double <b>bevel,</b> with <b>an</b> edge angle of 14-16° (included angle of 28-32°) and a maximum of 40° as specified by International standard ISO 8442.1 (knives for the preparation of food).|$|R
