40|$|The benzoquinone <b>ansamycins</b> {{inhibit the}} ATPase {{activity}} of the 90 -kDa heat shock protein (Hsp 90), disrupting the function of numerous client proteins involved in oncogenesis. In this study, we examine the role of NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO 1) in the metabolism of trans- and cis-amide isomers of the benzoquinone <b>ansamycins</b> and their mechanism of Hsp 90 inhibition. Inhibition of purified human Hsp 90 {{by a series of}} benzoquinone <b>ansamycins</b> was examined in the presence and absence of NQO 1, and their relative rate of NQO 1 -mediated reduction was determined. Computational-based molecular docking simulations indicated that the trans- but not the cis-amide isomers of the benzoquinone <b>ansamycins</b> could be accommodated by the NQO 1 active site, and the ranking order of binding energies correlated with the relative reduction rate using purified human NQO 1. The trans-cis isomerization of the benzoquinone <b>ansamycins</b> in Hsp 90 inhibition has been disputed in recent reports. Previous computational studies have used the closed or cocrystallized Hsp 90 structures in an attempt to explore this isomerization step; however, we have successfully docked both the trans- and cis-amide isomers of the benzoquinone <b>ansamycins</b> into the open Hsp 90 structure. The results of these studies indicate that both trans- and cis-amide isomers of the hydroquinone <b>ansamycins</b> exhibited increased binding affinity for Hsp 90 relative to their parent quinones. Our data support a mechanism in which trans- rather than cis-amide forms of benzoquinone <b>ansamycins</b> are metabolized by NQO 1 to hydroquinone <b>ansamycins</b> and that Hsp 90 -mediated trans-cis isomerization via tautomerization {{plays an important role in}} subsequent Hsp 90 inhibition...|$|R

40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{molecular chaperone}} Hsp 90 acts {{in concert with}} a cohort of associated proteins to facilitate the functional maturation {{of a number of}} cellular signaling proteins, such as steroid hormone receptors and oncogene tyrosine kinases. The Hsp 90 -associated protein p 23 is required for the assembly of functional steroid aporeceptor complexes in cell lysates, and Hsp 90 -binding <b>ansamycin</b> antibiotics disrupt the activity of Hsp 90 -dependent signaling proteins in cultured mammalian cells and prevent the association of p 23 with Hsp 90 -receptor heterocomplexes; these observations have led to the hypotheses that p 23 is required for the maturation of Hsp 90 target proteins and that <b>ansamycin</b> antibiotics abrogate the activity of such proteins by disrupting the interaction of p 23 with Hsp 90. In this study, I demonstrate that <b>ansamycin</b> antibiotics disrupt the function of Hsp 90 target proteins expressed in yeast cells; prevent the assembly of Sba 1, a yeast p 23 -like protein, into steroid receptor-Hsp 90 complexes; and result in the assembly of receptor-Hsp 90 complexes that are defective for ligand binding. To assess the role of p 23 in Hsp 90 target protein function, I show that the activity of Hsp 90 target proteins is unaffected by deletion of SBA 1.

40|$|A {{radiometric method}} to {{determine}} the MIC of <b>ansamycin</b> (LM 427) for Mycobacterium avium complex clinical isolates has been developed. It {{is based on a}} comparison of the conventional growth curve determination and the radiometric detection of growth (growth index) in the same liquid medium (7 H 12 broth). This new method requires less time and labor than does a conventional determination of MIC in liquid medium (CFU). Other advantages of this method include relatively short periods of exposure of the drug to 37 degrees C and the composition of 7 H 12 broth, which has practically no substrates which could absorb or bind the drug. Thus, a more accurate estimation of the MIC in this medium can be expected than by the conventional agar dilution (proportion) method. The MICs of <b>ansamycin</b> appeared to be higher in agar plates than in 7 H 12 broth. More than 70 % of the isolates had a broth-determined MIC one to three times lower than the average peak concentration of <b>ansamycin</b> achieved in sera of patients.

Although the activity and specificity of the unsubstituted <b>ansamycins</b> (streptovaricins and rifamycin SV) were modulated by conformation of the molecule and electron density of the aromatic ring, the principal mode of inhibition is, apparently, drug binding to a polymerase-template complex; the drug binds in a manner which prevents subsequent formation of a polymerase-template-primer complex. However, some derivatives of rifamycin SV, when substituted at carbon- 3 with bulky or hydrophobic side chains, displayed markedly different modes of action.
