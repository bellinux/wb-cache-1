40|$|One of a {{synthetic}} organic chemists‟ greatest challenges {{is to create}} step-efficient routes toward compounds with high molecular complexity. Therefore, reactions such as the meta photocycloaddition of an olefin to a benzene derivative, which provide more than one bond in a single step are of significant importance. It this remarkable reaction three new σ bonds, three new rings and up to six new stereocenters are formed simultaneously. Additional complexity can be added by tethering the two reacting partners together and this form of the reaction has found many uses in natural product synthesis. In this work a remarkable double [3 + 2] photocycloaddition reaction is reported that results {{in the formation of}} a complex cis, cis, cis, trans-[5, 5, 5, 5] fenestrane derivative from a simple flat <b>aromatic</b> <b>acetal</b> with two branching alkenes. During this dramatic transformation four carboncarbon bonds, five new rings and seven new stereocenters are created in a single one-pot process using only UV light. The reaction occurs in a sequential manner from the linear meta photocycloadduct, via a secondary [3 + 2] addition of the alkene across the cyclopropane of the adduct. In addition, an angular meta photocycloadduct also produced in the initial addition step, undergoes an alternative fragmentation-translocation photoreaction to afford a silphinene-like angular tricyclic compound. In this work the investigation of this newly discovered process is discussed via the synthesis and subsequent irradiation of a series of photosubstrates containing different functional groups in the arene-alkene tether. In addition, attempts toward the synthesis of alternative structures using the same double [3 + 2] photocycloaddition are reported. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Micelles of {{cetyltrimethylammonium bromide}} (CTAB) {{catalyze}} the basic cleavage of p-nitrophenyl alkanoates, whereas micelles of {{sodium dodecyl sulphate}} (SDS) inhibit this reaction. The strength of binding of the esters to both CTAB and SDS shows the same linear dependence and sensitivity to the acyl chain length, but the catalysis by CTAB and the inhibition by SDS do not depend on this parameter. Micelles of SDS catalyze the hydrolysis of <b>aromatic</b> <b>acetals</b> and orthoesters in the acidic solution. There is no sharp linear correlation between the substrate and the transition state binding for different acetals and orthoesters, which reflects the importance of both nature of the substituent, and its location in the molecule of the substrate. Amino- and carboxylate-terminated dendrimers modestly catalyze the basic cleavage of p-nitrophenyl alkanoates. Both substrate and transition state binding are independent on the ester acyl chain length, but {{were found to be}} a function of the dendrimer generation number. Carboxylate-terminated dendrimers catalyze the hydrolysis of <b>aromatic</b> <b>acetals</b> and orthoesters in the acidic solution. The observed dependence of the substrate and the transition state binding {{on the nature of the}} substituent supported the previously made suggestion that the interior of PAMAM dendrimers possesses hydrophilic character. The hydrolysis of <b>aromatic</b> <b>acetals</b> and orthoesters is retarded by cyclodextrins. The magnitude of the effect depends on the size of cyclodextrin cavity. The observed rate retardation is attributed to the unfavourable transition state binding to cyclodextrins, and possible retardation of diffusional separation of carboxonium ion and the newly formed alcohol molecule...|$|R

40|$|This thesis deals {{mainly with}} the {{synthesis}} of various sulfur/selenium-containing heterocyclic compounds, many of which include structural features present in several biologically active molecules, with particular emphasis on compounds of synthetic importance, such as indoles, {{as well as other}} heteroaromatic species. In the first part, an efficient procedure toward synthesis of new 3 -(arylthio) indoles based on reactions of aryl Grignard reagents or lithiated heteroaromatics with protected 3, 3 ′-dithiobisindoles is described. In addition, the heterocyclic core of the marine alkaloid echinosulfone A, namely 3, 3 ′-bis(indolyl) sulfone, was obtained by treatment of a 3 -lithioindole derivative with bis(phenylsulfonyl) sulfide. These methodologies offer convenient synthetic routes toward a wide range of 3 -(arylthio) indoles in good yields. In an extension, the sulfonation of 1 -(phenylsulfonyl) indoles and pyrroles using chlorosulfonic acid in acetonitrile has been studied, leading to development of a simple and clean protocol for synthesis of the corresponding 1 -phenylsulfonyl- 1 H-indole- 3 -sulfonyl chlorides and 1 -phenylsulfonyl- 1 H-pyrrole- 3 -sulfonyl chlorides. In the second part, a new practical approach is described toward {{the synthesis of}} several biologically active indolothiopyrans and related selenopyrans, as analogues of indolocarbazoles. The target compounds were accessed via treatment of C- 2 metalated indoles with bis(phenylsulfonyl) sulfide or selenide, followed by cyclization of the intermediate 2, 2 ′-di(indolyl) sulfide/selenides, involving for example triethyl orthoformate under acidic conditions. The final section of this thesis describes a new method for synthesis of dibenzo[b,f]thiepins and related fused systems via ortho-metalation of <b>aromatic</b> <b>acetals,</b> followed by treatment with bis(phenylsulfonyl) sulfide, initially giving symmetrical diaryl-sulfides, which were subjected to deacetalization, and finally McMurry coupling. The method could also be extended to preparation of thiepin analogues such as 1 -sila-, 1 -germa- and 1 -selenacyclohepta- 2, 4, 6 -trienes containing two fused aromatic or heterocyclic units...|$|R

The chemistry of electrophiles is common to synthetic organic chemistry, biochemistry, polymer chemistry, and industrial processes. Among the various reactions of electrophiles, aromatic substitution {{is one of the most}} significant conversions, a reaction with many synthetic applications. When cationic electrophiles react in strong Bronsted or Lewis acids, they can sometimes form the dicationic superelectrophiles. Superelectrophilic activation was first discovered by Olah in 1975 to explain the high reactivities of electrophiles in superacids. The superelectrophiles showed the abilities to react with weak nucleophiles like benzene, deactivated arenes and some alkanes. The heightened reactivities of superelectrophiles can be a useful driving force in organic chemical reactions. The Knorr cyclization involves acid catalyzed cylization of aromatic beta-ketoamides to 2 -quinolones. A new method for the synthesis of 2 -quinolones using superacid triflic acid (CF 3 SO 3 H) has been developed in our research. This route was proven to be much superior to the previous methods (which used traditional Bronsted acids as acid catalysts) in giving high yields of the products at room temperatures. Using low-temperature NMR (13 C, 15 N) and computational studies, we have proposed a mechanism in which the dicationic superelectrophile, i. e. O,O-diprotonated carboxonium ion, is formed. This is the correction of the original mechanism of Knorr cyclization. This work on beta-ketoamides initiated us to study the protonation of alpha-ketoamides in superacid media, and the condensation reaction produces oxyindole derivatives. Oxyindole derivatives exhibit a variety of biological activities and hence developing a new synthetic route to these compounds is highly desirable. Various 3, 3 -diaryl oxyindoles were synthesized by superacid-promoted CF 3 SO 3 H cyclization of aryl-substituted alpha-ketoamides in good yields. We have extended this superacid-catalyzed chemistry to alkyl, benzyl-substituted alpha-ketoamides and alpha-hydroxy ketoamides, which resulted in alpha,beta-unsaturated ketoamides and fluorene ring systems respectively. Additionally, superelectrophilic mechanisms are proposed for the cyclization reactions. In another study, we also examined the synthesis of various triarylmethane products based on an N-heterocyclic scaffold. Further, the involvement of N-heterocyclic superelectrophile in Single Electron Transfer (SET) chemistry was reported. The dimerization reactions in the presence of suitable electron donors like ferrocene were studied in greater details. Single crystal X-ray structure of the dimer was determined. Theoretical calculations support the involvement of superelectrophilic species in the formation of dimers. Following the previous study from Klumpp's research group on generation of N-acyliminium ions in superacid media, we have developed new methodologies to synthesize isoindolinone derivatives in superacid triflic acid. The synthetic route to isoindolinones involves in situ generation of N-acyliminium ions from substituted <b>aromatic</b> <b>acetals.</b> Thus, from all the above examples it can be understood that superelectrophilic activation can be effectively used to synthesize a variety of heterocyclic compounds. These new chemical reactions have the potential to be applied to the synthesis of different therapeutic agents...|$|R
40|$|Photochemical {{reactions}} of aromatic carbonyl compounds with silyl ketene acetals have been explored. Irradiation of acetonitrile or benzene solutions containing aryl aldehydes or ketones {{in the presence}} of silyl ketene acetals is observed to promote formation of β-hydroxyester, 2, 2 -dioxyoxetane and 3, 3 -dioxyoxetane products. The ratios of these photoproducts, which arise by competitive single electron transfer (SET) and classical Paterno-Buchi mechanistic pathways, is found to be dependent on the degree of methyl-substitution on the vinyl moieties of the ketene acetals in a manner which reflects expected alkyl substituent effects on the oxidation potentials of these electron rich donors. An analysis of the product distribution arising by irradiation of a solution containing butyrophenone (6) and the silyl ketene acetal 9, derived from methyl isobutyrate, provides an estimate of the rate constants for the competitive Norrish type II, SET and Paterno-Buchi processes occuring. Finally, sequences involving silyl ketene acetal-aryl aldehyde or ketone photoaddition followed by 2, 2 -dioxyoxetane hydrolysis represent useful procedures for Claisen-condensation type, β-hydroxyester synthesis.
