5|$|Recommended {{treatment}} for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral <b>artesunate</b> {{was superior to}} quinine in both children and adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E
5|$|Artemisinin is a {{sesquiterpene}} lactone {{containing a}} peroxide group, which {{is believed to}} be essential for its anti-malarial activity. Its derivatives, <b>artesunate</b> and artemether, have been used in clinics since 1987 for the treatment of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive malaria, especially cerebral malaria. These drugs are characterized by fast action, high efficacy and good tolerance. They kill the asexual forms of P. berghei and P. cynomolgi and have transmission-blocking activity. In 1985, Zhou Yiqing and his team combined artemether and lumefantrine into a single tablet, which was registered as a medicine in China in 1992. Later it became known as “Coartem”. Artemisinin combination treatments (ACTs) are now widely used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but access to ACTs is still limited in most malaria-endemic countries and only a minority of the patients who need artemisinin-based combination treatments receive them.|$|E
25|$|For adults, {{intravenous}} (IV) or intramuscular (IM) <b>artesunate</b> is recommended. Quinine is {{an acceptable}} alternative if parenteral <b>artesunate</b> is not available.|$|E
25|$|For children, {{especially}} in the malaria-endemic areas of Africa, <b>artesunate</b> IV or IM, quinine (IV infusion or divided IM injection), and artemether IM are recommended.|$|E
25|$|Other {{possible}} treatments {{include a}} combination of praziquantel with metrifonate, <b>artesunate,</b> or mefloquine. A Cochrane review found tentative evidence that when used alone, metrifonate was as effective as praziquantel.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} ACT {{is based on}} the level of {{resistance}} to the constituents in the combination. Artemisinin and its derivatives are not appropriate for monotherapy. As second-line antimalarial treatment, when initial treatment does not work, an alternative ACT known to be effective in the region is recommended, such as <b>artesunate</b> plus tetracycline or doxycycline or clindamycin, and quinine plus tetracycline or doxycycline or clindamycin. Any of these combinations is to be given for 7 days. For pregnant women, the recommended first-line treatment during the first trimester is quinine plus clindamycin for 7 days. <b>Artesunate</b> plus clindamycin for 7 days is indicated if this treatment fails. For travellers returning to nonendemic countries, atovaquone/proguanil, artemether/lumefantrineany and quinine plus doxycycline or clindamycin are recommended.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Cambodia was {{hit with}} a malaria epidemic. The {{situation}} of the epidemic was aggravated by a lack of qualified practitioners and poor quality control which led to a market of fake antimalarial drugs. Counterfeit antimalarial drugs were {{responsible for the deaths of}} at least 30 people during the epidemic. This has prompted efforts by MSF to set up and fund a malaria outreach project and utilise Village Malaria Workers. MSF also introduced a switching of first-line treatment to a combination therapy (<b>Artesunate</b> and Mefloquine) to combat resistance and fatality of old drugs that were used to treat the disease traditionally.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Artesunate</b> {{administered}} by intravenous or intramuscular injection has proven superior to quinine in large, randomised controlled trials in both adults [...] and children. Combining all trials comparing these two drugs, <b>artesunate</b> {{is associated with}} a mortality rate that is approximately 30% lower than that of quinine. Reasons for this difference include reduced incidence of hypoglycaemia, easier administration and more rapid action against circulating and sequestered parasites. <b>Artesunate</b> is now recommended by the WHO for treatment of all cases of severe malaria. Effective treatment with ACT (Artemisinin Combination Therapy) has proven to lower the morbidity and mortality from malaria within two years by around 70%.|$|E
2500|$|When {{chloroquine}} {{resistance is}} common or when chloroquine is contraindicated, then <b>artesunate</b> is the drug of choice, {{except in the}} U.S., where it is not approved for use. Where an artemisinin-based combination therapy has been adopted as the first-line treatment for P. falciparum malaria, {{it may also be}} used for P. vivax malaria in combination with primaquine for radical cure. An exception is <b>artesunate</b> plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP), which is not effective against P. vivax in many places. Mefloquine is a good alternative and in some countries is more readily available. [...] Atovaquone-proguanil is an effective alternative in patients unable to tolerate chloroquine. Quinine may be used to treat vivax malaria but is associated with inferior outcomes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artesunate</b> is {{typically}} a well tolerated medicine. Known contraindications include a previous severe allergic reaction to <b>artesunate.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Artesunate</b> Plus Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine is an artesunate-based oral {{medication}} used {{to treat}} malaria. It consists of <b>artesunate</b> and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine.|$|E
50|$|For adults, {{intravenous}} (IV) or intramuscular (IM) <b>artesunate</b> is recommended. Quinine is {{an acceptable}} alternative if parenteral <b>artesunate</b> is not available.|$|E
50|$|With {{increased}} use of I.V. <b>artesunate,</b> {{there have been reports}} of post-artesunate delayed haemolysis (PADH). Delayed haemolysis (occurring around two weeks after treatment) has been observed in patients treated with <b>artesunate</b> for severe malaria. It is unclear whether or not this haemolysis is due to <b>artesunate</b> or to the malaria itself.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artesunate</b> is {{safe for}} use in children. <b>Artesunate</b> + sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine should be avoided in the newborns due to sulfadoxine/pyrmethamine effects on bilirubin. Parenteral <b>artesunate</b> dosing for {{treatment}} of severe malaria in children less than 20 kg should be {{higher than that of}} adults in order to increase exposure. When <b>artesunate</b> cannot be given orally or intramuscularly due to an individual's weakness or inability to swallow, rectal administration may be given as pre-referral treatment as long as parenteral administration is initiated after transfer to a more advanced facility.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artesunate</b> suppositories {{are used}} for the {{treatment}} of malaria. <b>Artesunate</b> is an antimalarial water-soluble derivative of dihydroartemisinin. Artemisinins are sesquiterpene lactones isolated from Artemisia annua, a Chinese traditional medicine.|$|E
50|$|When {{given in}} {{the second or third}} trimesters of {{pregnancy}}, no artesunate-related adverse pregnancy outcomes have been reported. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the safety of <b>artesunate</b> use in the first trimester of pregnancy. The WHO recommends that <b>artesunate</b> use for severe malaria in the first trimester should be based on the individual risks versus benefits. In absence of other viable treatment options, <b>artesunate</b> may be used.|$|E
50|$|Animal {{experiments}} {{showed that}} <b>artesunate,</b> a synthetic derivative of artemisinin, has anti-allergic properties, by effecting mast cell degranulation. This makes <b>artesunate</b> {{a candidate for}} treatment of allergic asthma. A Metabolomics animal study further strengthens this hope.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artesunate</b> is {{the first}} line {{treatment}} for children or adults with severe malaria. The recommendation is to treat with at least 24 hours of <b>artesunate</b> by injection. Artemisinin-based combination therapy may be used by mouth in persons that can tolerate it after 24 hours by injection. In facilities where long-term care is not appropriate, <b>artesunate</b> may be given as a single intramuscular injection or by rectal route (children < 6 years) prior to transferring care {{to a higher level}} facility.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artesunate</b> {{is one of}} {{a number}} of {{artemisinin}} derivatives discovered and developed by Chinese scientists and registered in China in the 1980s. Since the 1990s, UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) supported studies to assess the properties of the drug. There were already indications that <b>artesunate,</b> given rectally, was effective in severe malaria. Significant work with artemisinin suppositories in severe malaria was conducted in Viet Nam in the early 1990s, and clinical trials of rectal <b>artesunate</b> followed by mefloquine treatment in moderately severe malaria were conducted in Thailand.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Artesunate</b> (water-soluble: for oral, rectal, intramuscular, or {{intravenous}} use) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanisms}} of action of <b>artesunate</b> remains unclear and debatable. <b>Artesunate</b> is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to its active form dihydroartemisinin (DHA). This process involves hydrolysis of the 4-carbon ester group via plasma esterase enzyme. It is {{hypothesized that the}} cleavage of endoperoxide bridge in the pharmacophore of DHA generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which increases oxidative stress and causes malarial protein damage via alkylation. In addition, <b>Artesunate</b> potently inhibits the essential Plasmodium falciparum exported protein 1 (EXP1), a membrane glutathione S-transferase. As a result, the amount of glutathione in the parasite is reduced.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artesunate</b> (AS) is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} malaria. The intravenous form is preferred to quinidine for severe malaria. Often it is used as part of combination therapy. It is not used {{for the prevention of}} malaria. <b>Artesunate</b> can be given by injection into a vein, injection into a muscle, or taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artesunate</b> is {{preferred}} over parenteral quinine for severe malaria treatment. <b>Artesunate</b> {{was shown to}} prevent more deaths from severe malaria than quinine in two large multicentre randomized controlled trials from Africa and Asia. A subsequent systematic review of seven randomized controlled trials found this improvement in survival rates to be consistent across all trials.|$|E

50|$|In 2007, the FDA {{approved}} an Investigational New Drug (IND) {{protocol for}} intravenous <b>artesunate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It {{consists}} of chlorproguanil, dapsone, and <b>artesunate.</b> (It {{can also be}} interpreted as Lapdap+artesunate.) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Artesunate</b> + sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine for {{treatment}} of P. vivax is not recommended due to high rates of resistance.|$|E
50|$|A mass drug {{administration}} campaign using S/P, <b>artesunate</b> and primaquine {{was completed in}} Moshi district, Tanzania in 2008. The findings {{have yet to be}} published.|$|E
50|$|For children, {{especially}} in the malaria-endemic areas of Africa, <b>artesunate</b> IV or IM, quinine (IV infusion or divided IM injection), and artemether IM are recommended.|$|E
50|$|Drugs {{that should}} be avoided while on <b>artesunate</b> are the drugs that inhibit the liver enzyme CYP2A6. These drugs include amiodarone, desipramine, isoniazid, ketoconazole, letrozole, methoxsalen, tranylcypromine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artesunate</b> is {{generally}} safe and well-tolerated. The best recognised {{side effect of}} the artemesinins is that they lower reticulocyte counts. This is not usually of clinical relevance.|$|E
50|$|Although not FDA-approved {{for use in}} the United States, <b>artesunate</b> is used as the {{treatment}} of choice for severe malaria by the World Health Organization (WHO) over quinidine.|$|E
5000|$|Industrial resins {{based on}} acrylic and/or methacrylic acid esters are {{invariably}} produced by radical polymerization with organic peroxides at elevated temperatures. The polymerization rate is adjusted by suitable choice of temperature {{and type of}} peroxide. [...] Some peroxides are drugs, whose action {{is based on the}} formation of radicals at desired locations in the organism. For example, artemisinin and its derivatives, such as such <b>artesunate,</b> possess the most rapid action of all current drugs against falciparum malaria. <b>Artesunate</b> is also efficient in reducing egg production in Schistosoma haematobium infection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artesunate</b> is {{also used}} to treat less severe forms of malaria when it can be given orally. It has {{activity}} against P. ovale, P. malariae, and severe P. knowlesi.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artesunate</b> is {{made from}} dihydroartemisinin (DHA) by {{reacting}} it with succinic acid anhydride in a basic medium. It {{is one of many}} semi-synthetic derivatives from Artemisinin that is water-soluble.|$|E
50|$|Other {{possible}} treatments {{include a}} combination of praziquantel with metrifonate, <b>artesunate,</b> or mefloquine. A Cochrane review found tentative evidence that when used alone, metrifonate was as effective as praziquantel.|$|E
