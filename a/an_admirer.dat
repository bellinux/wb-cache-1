The conquest of Syria continued under his Generalship and, Abu Ubaidah being <b>an</b> <b>admirer</b> of Khalid, gave him command of the cavalry and used him as a military advisor.|$|E

Here in June 1849 he was visited by Jenny Lind.|$|E
5|$|During {{his student}} years in England, Jinnah was {{influenced}} by 19th-century British liberalism, like many other future Indian independence leaders.

He became <b>an</b> <b>admirer</b> of the Parsi British Indian political leaders Dadabhai Naoroji and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. Naoroji had become the first British Member of Parliament of Indian extraction shortly before Jinnah's arrival, triumphing with a majority of three votes in Finsbury Central.

5|$|In France, the premiership of Aristide Briand, {{a leading}} proponent of {{engaging}} with Constantine {{to bring about}} a reconciliation of the two Greek administrations, was threatened by the events in Athens, leading to the reorganization of the French government. In Britain, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and foreign minister Sir Edward Grey resigned and were replaced by Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour. The change in the British leadership proved to be particularly important for Greece, since Lloyd George was a known Hellenophile, <b>an</b> <b>admirer</b> of Venizelos and dedicated to resolving the Eastern Question.|$|E

The album earned D'Rivera the Latin Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{the return}} of the ship on which Mälzel died, his various machines, {{including}} the Turk, fell into the hands of a friend of Mälzel's, the businessman John Ohl. He attempted to auction off the Turk, but owing to low bidding ultimately bought it himself for $400. Only when John Kearsley Mitchell from Philadelphia, Edgar Allan Poe's personal physician and <b>an</b> <b>admirer</b> of the Turk, approached Ohl did the Turk change hands again. Mitchell formed a restoration club and went about the business of repairing the Turk for public appearances, completing the restoration in 1840.|$|E
5|$|At these concerts, Bache {{frequently}} {{appeared as}} soloist, accompanist or conductor, {{but he also}} engaged other artists {{in an attempt to}} show he was not giving the concerts out of self-aggrandizement. Bülow conducted two concerts, Edward Dannreuther led the orchestra in two concerts. August Manns, the conductor of a series of orchestral concerts held at the Crystal Palace and <b>an</b> <b>admirer</b> of Liszt's works, led four concerts. The majority of instrumentalists engaged were also members of the Crystal Palace orchestra to ensure the level of performance was as high as possible. Among guest soloists was the noted violinist August Wilhelmj, who played the Bach Chaconne in D minor at one concert.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier was <b>an</b> <b>admirer</b> of {{the elegance}} and wit {{in the work}} of satirical French writers and artists of the eighteenth century, and often {{employed}} grotesques in his descriptions to ridicule the ostentation of colonial aristocracy. Examples include Ti Noel's comparison of wax heads at a barber's shop to white men's heads being served at a banquet, or the portrayal of the decadence of Mademoiselle Floridor, a fourth-rate actress who performs for slaves as an outlet for her desire to act. Carpentier further satirizes the pomp of those in power through a series of details of protocol and ceremony whose cumulative effects ridicule the object of description, {{as is the case with}} Henri Christophe's chambers.|$|E

5|$|Custine's {{leadership}} and character, although impugned by the Tribunal, proved fundamentally {{sound in the}} field. As <b>an</b> <b>admirer</b> of the Prussian style of drill and discipline, he was a strict disciplinarian, but his soldiers actually liked him, and felt inspired by him. Custine liked to make speeches and reportedly knew the names of his soldiers. He visited men in the hospital, demonstrated blunt good humor, and was the master of repartee. His ready wit was quoted throughout his command. He did not tolerate disorder or insubordination however; when encountering a troop of volunteers in 1792, who bragged {{that they were going}} to teach the army the right step (make it Republican), he ordered his cavalry to surround and disarm them.|$|E
5|$|Hu Die {{retired in}} 1966, after a career {{spanning}} {{more than four}} decades.

She emigrated to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 1975 to join her son. She lived a low-key life and avoided attention by using the name Pan Baojuan. She dictated her memoir in 1986, which first appeared in Taiwan's United Daily News in serials, and was published in mainland China in 1987. She died on 23 April 1989, after suffering a stroke.|$|E

The Palatinate cause {{was a popular}} Protestant issue in England, and in 1637 a general public {{subscription}} helped fund an expedition under Charles Louis to try and regain the electorate {{as part of a}} joint French campaign. Rupert was placed in command of a Palatinate cavalry regiment, and his later friend Lord Craven, <b>an</b> <b>admirer</b> of Rupert's mother, assisted in raising funds and accompanied the army on the campaign. The campaign ended badly at the Battle of Vlotho (17 October 1638) during the invasion of Westphalia; Rupert escaped death, but was captured by the forces of the Imperial General Melchior von Hatzfeldt {{towards the end of the}} battle.|$|E
