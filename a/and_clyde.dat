5|$|By the 1930s {{these had}} fallen into disuse, and the locks were {{dismantled}} in 1933. The Forth <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> Canal closed {{at the end of}} 1962, and by the mid-1970s the Union Canal was filled in at both ends, rendered impassable by culverts in two places and run in pipes under a housing estate. The British Waterways Board (BWB) came into existence on 1 January 1963, the day the Forth <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> Canal was closed, with the objective of finding a broad strategy for the future of canals in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, the BWB decided after {{a meeting}} with local councils that the Forth <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> Canal, {{fragmented}} by various developments, was to have its remaining navigability preserved by building new bridges with sufficient headroom for boats and continuing to maintain the existing locks. Restoration of sea-to-sea navigation was deemed too expensive at the time, but {{there were to be}} no further restrictions on its use. A 1979 survey report documented 69 obstructions to navigation, and sought the opinions of twenty interested parties to present the Forth <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> Local (Subject) Plan in 1980.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun {{is often}} held in high regard by the Southern Lost Cause historians, who hold a romanticized {{view of the}} old Southern {{way of life and}} its cause during the Civil War. Historians such as Charles M. Wiltse, Margaret Coit, <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> N. Wilson have, in their writings, portrayed Calhoun as a {{sympathetic}} or heroic figure.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, {{she played}} the title role in the science fiction spoof Barbarella, which {{established}} her status as a sex symbol. In contrast, the tragedy They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969) won her critical acclaim, and she earned her first Oscar nomination for the role. Fonda was very selective {{by the end of}} the 1960s, turning down lead roles in Rosemary's Baby and Bonnie <b>and</b> <b>Clyde,</b> which went to Mia Farrow and Faye Dunaway, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In March 1999 the Secretary of State for Scotland cut {{the first}} sod of turf {{to begin work}} at lock 31 on the Forth <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> Canal. Over 1000 people were {{employed}} {{in the construction of}} the wheel, which has been designed to last for at least 120 years.|$|E
5|$|The Falkirk Wheel is a {{rotating}} boat lift in Scotland, connecting the Forth <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> Canal with the Union Canal. The lift {{is named after}} the town it resides in of Falkirk in central Scotland. It opened in 2002, reconnecting the two canals {{for the first time}} since the 1930s as part of the Millennium Link project.|$|E

5000|$|Georgie Fame's 1967 single [...] "The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde", {{the lyrics}} of which tell of Bonnie's <b>and</b> <b>Clyde's</b> exploits, reached No 1 in the UK Singles Chart. This song was {{inspired}} by the movie about them.|$|R
5|$|Heartstrings, {{like the}} first record, was very much {{influenced}} by film, and is recognized for its cinematic quality. Juanita indicated that they deliberately made the album {{to sound like a}} soundtrack to a movie. Howling Bells along with the production team watched Paris, Texas and Blue Velvet, in an effort to replicate the mood, emotion, and atmosphere of these two films in particular. Other films that {{played a significant role in}} the making of Heartstrings include, Badlands, Bonnie <b>and</b> <b>Clyde,</b> Klute, , Nashville, Pleasantville, The Last Picture Show, and Vivre sa vie.|$|E
5|$|Pontecorvo's 1945 paper {{credits the}} idea using carbon {{tetrachloride}} (CCl4) to the French physicist Jules Guéron. Experiments were conducted at Chalk River using the NRX as a neutrino source, but were unsuccessful, and were abandoned in 1949, after Pontecorvo had left. The experiment was unsuccessful because, unknown at the time, nuclear reactors produced antineutrinos instead of neutrinos. In {{what is now}} known as the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment, Frederick Reines <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> Cowan detected antineutrinos in 1955, for which they won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 McDonald's NBA All-Star Celebrity Game {{was played}} on Friday, February 13 at the Phoenix Convention Center. A total of 16 celebrities {{took part in}} the game, {{including}} several former NBA players. Basketball Hall of Famers Magic Johnson and Julius Erving, who combined for 23 NBA All-Star appearances, served as coaches for the celebrity teams. NBA legends, Dominique Wilkins <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> Drexler, were joined by former players, Dan Majerle and Rick Fox, in the celebrity team roster. WNBA stars Lisa Leslie and Kara Lawson also participated in the game along with four Harlem Globetrotters players.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the {{subsequent}} United States declaration of war upon Italy rendered Segrè an enemy alien and cut him off from communication with his parents. Physicists began leaving the Radiation Laboratory to do war work, and Raymond T. Birge asked him to teach classes to the remaining students. This provided a useful supplement to Segrè's income, and he established important friendships and professional associations {{with some of these}} students, who included Owen Chamberlain <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> Wiegand.|$|E
5|$|When a {{new type}} of film {{allowing}} the photographing of faster moving action was introduced in 1931, Cronjager was one of the cinematographers who participated in the ASC's field testing of the product. In 1932 Cronjager worked with two other well-known cinematographers, Lucien Andriot <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> De Vinna, on King Vidor's film, Bird of Paradise. The individual results of the three photographers was very high quality, but the integration of their work, all with very different styles, proved less than desirable to critics. Cronjager worked with Dix again in 1933, on the film The Lost Squadron, which also starred Mary Astor, and was directed by George Archainbaud.|$|E
5|$|A {{coincidental}} upswing in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof positive that the code was working. Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Bonnie <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably positive aspects of the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The money saved was in the millions annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E
50|$|The Clyde River {{has four}} {{hydroelectric}} dams before reaching Lake Memphremagog. The watershed includes Brighton (Essex County), Charleston, Morgan (Essex County), Derby, Seymour Pond, Echo Lakes, <b>and</b> Island, <b>Clyde</b> <b>and</b> Pensioner ponds.|$|R

50|$|On Marvin <b>and</b> <b>Clyde's</b> shared gravestone, Marvin's year {{of birth}} is incorrect. His mother gave the stone cutters their sister Nell's birth year for him. However, she had {{recorded}} the birth dates of all her children in the family Bible; there, Marvin's birth date is 1903.|$|R
5|$|Churchill {{has been}} active since at least 1984 as the co-director of the Denver-based American Indian Movement of Colorado, now an {{autonomous}} chapter of the American Indian Movement. In 1993, he and other local AIM leaders, including Russell Means, Glenn T. Morris, Robert Robideau, and David Hill, broke with the national AIM leadership, including Dennis Banks and the brothers Vernon <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> Bellecourt, claiming that all AIM chapters are autonomous. The AIM Grand Governing Council is based in Minneapolis and retains {{the name of the}} national group. It says that the schism arose when Means, Churchill, Glenn T. Morris and others openly supported the Miskito Indian group Misurasata, who were allied with the anti-revolutionary, CIA-backed Contras.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Rachel {{decides to}} return to her community. Mr. Will is bailed out of jail by Tim, who is looking for Rachel. Together, he and Mr. Will drive out to the community, and on the way they {{discover}} Clyde, whose van has broken down on the highway. As Rachel is about to be wed, Tim, Mr. Will, <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> pull {{up in front of the}} church in the red Mustang and rescue her. Mr. Will returns to the community and is accepted back with a confession that Rachel has recorded on the blue cassette, although she still firmly believes that God has fathered her child. Some months later, Clyde and a visibly pregnant Rachel are living in a tent by the beach and hold hands as they walk through the waves.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, with Bobby Moore, Brian Dear <b>and</b> <b>Clyde</b> Best, Greaves was {{involved}} in late-night drinking, against the wishes of manager Ron Greenwood, prior to an FA Cup tie away to Blackpool. On arriving in Blackpool, Greaves and his teammates had been informed {{by members of the}} press that the game, the following day, was unlikely to go ahead due to a frozen pitch and the likelihood of frost that night. Believing {{that there would be no}} game the following day, Greaves drank 12 lagers in a club owned by Brian London and did not return to the team hotel until 1.45am. In fact, the match went ahead and West Ham lost 4–0. Greaves claimed the defeat was not a result of the late night, the drinking or the frozen pitch, but because the West Ham team in which he was playing was not good enough. As a result, the players were fined and dropped by the club.|$|E
60|$|And then of {{a sudden}} her regard for respectability <b>and</b> <b>Clyde’s</b> sense of what was right were thrown on the scrap-heap of {{unnecessary}} things. They had been useful and highly important in their time, but the death of Vanessa’s husband made them of no immediate moment.|$|R
5000|$|Clyde {{died in a}} Dallas {{hospital}} after a lengthy illness. He and his wife, the former Sharon Ann [...] "Sherry" [...] Ferrell, had three sons, Nelson Clyde, IV, Andrew Ferrell <b>Clyde,</b> <b>and</b> John Kittrell Clyde; a daughter, Anna <b>Clyde</b> Malone, <b>and</b> seven grandchildren.
