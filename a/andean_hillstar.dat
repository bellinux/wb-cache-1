About 80 other bird species are present, including the horned coot, Andean goose, and <b>Andean</b> <b>hillstar.</b> The Andean fox, or culpeo, is also present, and [...] "islands" [...] in the Salar (in particular Incahuasi Island) host colonies of rabbit-like viscachas.|$|E

The male usually has an iridescent green throat, or bluish-purple in the Ecuadorian hillstar, with dull greenish upperparts and pale flanks. The central underparts are usually black, but are brown in the <b>Andean</b> <b>hillstar.</b> The tail is usually dark with a contrasting white pattern; {{the pattern is}} cinnamon in the wedge-tailed hillstar, and the tail is entirely dark in the black-breasted hillstar. The female is duller, with a whitish throat densely spotted with green, white, buff, or cinnamon underparts, and a dark tail with a white pattern.|$|E
