25|$|In this example, {{the general}} {{deliverables}} within an implementation of software are mentioned, executed and delivered differently {{as time goes}} by, mainly because of dependencies between deliverables. For instance, the actual go for the delivery of the software and the other related deliverables are dependent {{on the outcome of}} the deliverable “Proeftuin”. “Proeftuin” is an agreed period in which the software is extensively tested by the customer organization, provided and supported by the supplier. The customer organization can get <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> the use of the software in the target domain, to guarantee that the software is a “fit” within the organization.|$|E
25|$|The Little 500 is {{much more}} than just the race. There are also several series events {{associated}} with the race. These events are held for a few reasons. The first and foremost is for fun. The second reason is so that teams can scout out the competition and get <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> that year's race field. And the final reason is so that all the members of a team, not just those competing in the actual race itself, can still participate and compete. There are four other series events outside of the race: Qualifications, ITTs, Miss-N-Out, and Team Pursuit.|$|E

With [...] "Believe in the Spirit", she worked to create a song that would appeal to both players and the production team.

500|$|In an interview, Copeland stated his {{creative}} process for writing {{the music for}} the Spyro series always began by playing through the levels, trying to get <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> each world's [...] "atmosphere". Copeland noted the challenge of writing for games was to create music that would both be interesting to listen to and complemented the gameplay; his approach was to incorporate more complicated harmonies and basslines so that the music could seem fresh for players, even after repeated listening. He complimented the compact disc format of the PlayStation and its support for high quality audio; there were no technical constraints that stopped him from producing the sound he wanted. Copeland recorded entire orchestral scores for extra flourish when the visuals called for an expansive sound, but used more percussive and beat-driven melodies for [...] "high-energy" [...] moments in the game.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the modest}} {{commercial}} success of Gone Baby Gone, Warner Bros. developed a close {{working relationship with}} Affleck and offered him his choice of the studio's scripts. He decided to direct the crime drama The Town (2010), an adaptation of Chuck Hogan's novel Prince of Thieves. He also co-wrote the screenplay and starred in the film as a bank robber. The film became a surprise box office hit, and gained further critical acclaim for Affleck. A.O. Scott of The New York Times praised his [...] "skill and self-confidence as a serious director," [...] while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times noted: [...] "Affleck has the stuff of a real director. Everything is here. It's an effective thriller, he works closely with actors, he has <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> pacing."

500|$|... "The Unnatural" [...] was {{the first}} entry of the series to be {{directed}} by Duchovny. While Duchovny was working on plot points with Carter, the two agreed that the episode would serve as Duchovny's directorial debut. As the episode did not heavily feature his character, since it is framed as a flashback, Duchovny was {{able to focus on}} pre-production. This narratological method also gave Anderson a minor respite from her work. While Duchovny later expressed gratitude that [...] "The Unnatural" [...] enabled him to get <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> directing, he also experienced severe anxiety during the production process because of the stress of both writing and directing. However, when the episode was finished, Duchovny was pleased, calling the results [...] "great." [...] He later noted that his stress was largely uncalled for because the episode would have been made even [...] "if [...] just showed up and drooled for 24 hours a day." ...|$|E

500|$|Hall was in New York City and {{thinking}} {{of going back to}} theatre work, and had no intention of returning to television so quickly. However, he changed his mind after reading the script, because he was [...] "intrigued by the macabre mix of dark humor, chilling violence, and a unique central character." [...] He also said that he [...] "realized it was a big commitment and certainly appreciated that coming off of Six Feet Under" [...] but said that he [...] "couldn't pass it up". Lindsay was initially against casting Hall, based on seeing him on Six Feet Under, but after he saw Hall speak one line of the script, Lindsay changed his mind, describing Hall as [...] "absolutely perfect" [...] to portray Dexter. To prepare for the part, Hall read various books on the psychology of serial killers, read transcripts of interviews with serial killers, and spent time with the head blood-spatter analyst at the Miami precinct. He also watched people in New York restaurants to get <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> {{what it would be like}} to stalk them.|$|E
500|$|Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} a hundred people, over the course of two years. After Call of Duty 2, the Infinity Ward team decided {{to move away from the}} World War II environment of previous games in the series. This resulted in three game concepts: Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, [...] and [...] While developing the story for Call of Duty 4, Infinity Ward chose to avoid referencing current, real-life wars, and keep the series' common theme of two opposing forces of similar strength. To enhance the realistic feel of the game, the development team attended a live-fire exercise at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, a training facility in the California desert. This helped the developers to simulate the effects of being near an Abrams tank when it fires. The team also talked with U.S. Marines who were recently in combat to get <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> the background, emotions, and attitude of Marines in combat. Veterans were also recruited to supervise motion capture sessions and the artificial intelligence design of the game.|$|E
500|$|To get <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> the era, X-Files {{composer}} Mark Snow {{listened to}} the big band music of Gene Krupa, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and Harry James. The [...] "bouncy instrumental" [...] that plays during the fight scene in the ballroom {{was inspired by a}} similar swing tune composed by John Williams for the 1979 Steven Spielberg film 1941. Snow later joked that his composition was [...] "the third generation of the same inspiration." [...] Carter had significant musical input when it came to scene transitions, saying, [...] "I got a chance to use some of my favorite '40s music here, too, or '30s and '40s music to transition scenes." [...] The song that is heard {{near the end of the}} ballroom fight and in the scene featuring Scully and the Lone Gunmen searching for the Queen Anne is a piece of stock music called [...] "Hot Liquorice", composed by Dick Walters. Producer Paul Rabwin oversaw a special arrangement of the 1938 jazz standard [...] "Jeepers Creepers", which was included in the ballroom scene.|$|E

50|$|Bull of Heaven {{is mostly}} {{known for its}} slow, lengthy, unchanging music. Usually the focus is around dark ambient, minimalism, and drone; however, the band {{is not limited to}} just these genres. 237: Disordered Before the Naked Picture of Despair is an avant-garde jazz loop. Similarly, 261: <b>A</b> <b>Feeling</b> <b>for</b> the Order Lying Behind the Appearance is a more {{traditional}} progressive rock/avant-garde jazz song. There are elements of spoken word, post-rock, harsh noise, modern classical, drone doom, and many more throughout the band's discography.|$|R
