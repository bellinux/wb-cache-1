5000|$|<b>Angioblast</b> (or vasoformative cell) is the {{embryonic}} {{tissue from}} which blood vessels arise. Blood vessels first make their appearance in several scattered vascular {{areas that are}} developed simultaneously between the endoderm and the mesoderm of the yolk-sac, i. e., outside {{the body of the}} embryo. Here a new type of cell, the <b>angioblast,</b> is differentiated from the mesoderm.|$|E
50|$|Further {{evidence}} to corroborate hemangioblasts {{come from the}} expression of various genes such as CD34 and Tie2 by both lineages. The fact that this expression was seen in both EC and HPC lineages led researchers to propose a common origin. However, endothelial markers like Flk1/VEGFR-2 are exclusive to ECs but stop HPCs from progressing into an EC. It is accepted that VEGFR-2+ cells are a common precursor for HPCs and ECs. If the Vegfr3 gene is deleted then both HPC and EC differentiation comes {{to a halt in}} embryos. VEGF promotes <b>angioblast</b> differentiation; whereas, VEGFR-1 stops the hemangioblast from becoming an EC. In addition, basic fibroblast growth factor FGF-2 is also involved in promoting angioblasts from the mesoderm. After angioblasts commit to becoming an EC, the angioblasts gather and rearrange to assemble in a tube similar to a capillary. Angioblasts can travel during the formation of the circulatory system to configure the branches to allow for directional blood flow. Pericytes and smooth muscle cells encircle ECs when they are differentiating into arterial or venous arrangements. Surrounding the ECs creates a brace to help stabilize the vessels known as the pericellular basal lamina. It is suggested pericytes and smooth muscle cells come from neural crest cells and the surrounding mesenchyme.|$|E
40|$|The {{pharyngeal}} arch arteries (PAAs) are transient embryonic {{blood vessels}} that mature into critical {{segments of the}} aortic arch and its branches. Although defects in PAA development cause life-threating congenital cardiovascular defects, the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate PAA morphogenesis remain unclear. Through small-molecule screening in zebrafish, we identified TGF-β signaling as indispensable for PAA development. Specifically, chemical inhibition of the TGF-β type I receptor ALK 5 impairs PAA development because nkx 2. 5 + PAA progenitor cells fail to differentiate into tie 1 + angioblasts. Consistent with this observation, we documented a burst of ALK 5 -mediated Smad 3 phosphorylation within PAA progenitors that foreshadows <b>angioblast</b> emergence. Remarkably, premature induction of TGF-β receptor activity stimulates precocious <b>angioblast</b> differentiation, thereby demonstrating the sufficiency of this pathway for initiating the PAA progenitor to <b>angioblast</b> transition. More broadly, these data uncover TGF-β as a rare signaling pathway that is necessary and sufficient for <b>angioblast</b> lineage commitment...|$|E

40|$|We have {{discovered}} that <b>angioblasts</b> trigger an early inductive event in pancreatic differentiation. This event occurs soon after gastrulation, before the formation of blood vessels. Morphological studies revealed that Lmo 2 -expressing <b>angioblasts</b> reside in proximity to the somitic mesoderm and the gut endoderm from which pancreatic progenitors arise. The chemokine ligand CXCL 12 expressed in the gut endoderm functions to attract the <b>angioblasts</b> that express its receptor CXCR 4. <b>Angioblasts</b> then signal back to the gut endoderm to induce Pdx 1 expression. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments for CXCL 12 and CXCR 4 were performed to test their function in blood vessel formation and pancreatic differentiation. The ectopic expression of Cxcl 12 in the endoderm attracted the <b>angioblasts</b> and induced ectopic Pdx 1 expression, resulting in an expanded pancreatic bud and an increased area of insulin-expressing cells. By contrast, in chick embryos treated with beads soaked in AMD 3100, an inhibitor of CXCR 4, the migration of <b>angioblasts</b> towards the Cxcl 12 -expressing gut endoderm was arrested, causing a malformation of blood vessels. This led to the generation of a smaller pancreatic bud and a reduced area of insulin-expressing cells. Taken together, {{these results indicate that}} the gut endoderm and <b>angioblasts</b> attract each other through reciprocal CXCL 12 and CXCR 4 signaling. This has a pivotal role in the fate establishment of the pancreatic progenitor cells and in the potentiation of further differentiation into endocrine β-cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to culture and {{characterize}} endothelial cells and <b>angioblasts,</b> vascular precursors, from adult and neonatal dog retina and determine if <b>angioblasts</b> are committed to endothelial cell lineage or have the potential to be multipotent, i. e. express phenotypic characteristics of other vascular cell types. Endothelial cells were established from adult dog retina (ADREC) by the technique of Gitlin and D 2 ̆ 7 Amore. For <b>angioblasts,</b> pieces of neonatal day 2 (P 2) avascular peripheral retina were placed under coverslips until sufficient cells had explanted. All cells were maintained initially on hyaluronic acid (HA) /fibronectin (IN) substratum. Neonatal canine retinal <b>angioblasts</b> (NCRA) were maintained initially on retinal-derived growth factor with alpha-amino adipic acid to inhibit growth of Muller cells. Cell lines were characterized by enzyme histochemistry [menadione-dependent alpha glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha GPDH), marker for angioblasts] and immunocytochemistry. Once characterized, cells were grown on FN, or collagens I or IV substrata and fed platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) or fibroblast growth factor- 2 (FGF- 2). The phenotypic expression of a marker for endothelial cells [acetylated LDL (acLDL) uptake] or a marker for pericytes and smooth muscle cells, production of alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA), was evaluated under those conditions. The canine retinal cell lines that were established had the following characteristics when maintained on serum and a retinal extract. <b>Angioblasts</b> had low expression of vWf and VEGF-R 2 (two markers for canine endothelial cells), and very low uptake of acLDL but high expression of alpha GPDH and adenosine A 2 a receptors (A 2 aR) (two markers for canine <b>angioblasts</b> in vivo). ADREC had high expression of endothelial cell markers (vWf, VEGF-R 2, and acLDL uptake) but minimal expression of aGPDH and A 2 aR. Both <b>angioblasts</b> and endothelial cells expressed CXCR 4, a marker for hemangioblasts. <b>Angioblasts</b> grown on any of the substrata in the presence of FGF- 2 had high uptake of acLDL and low expression of alpha SMA, while those grown in the presence of PDGF-BB had high expression of aSMA and low uptake of acLDL. In conclusion, <b>angioblasts</b> cultured from peripheral vascular retina have low expression of endothelial cell markers and high aGPDH and A 2 aR, markers for canine <b>angioblasts</b> in vivo. <b>Angioblasts</b> will internalize acLDL when maintained on FGF- 2 and express alpha SMA when maintained on PDGF-BB, suggesting that they have the potential to become endothelial cells or pericytes, i. e. are multipotent.

40|$|Rationale: Endothelial {{cells are}} developmentally derived from angioblasts {{specified}} in the mesodermal germ cell layer. The transcription factor etsrp/etv 2 {{is at the top}} of the known genetic hierarchy for <b>angioblast</b> development. The transcriptional events that induce etsrp expression and <b>angioblast</b> specification are not well understood. Objective: We generated etsrp:gfp transgenic zebrafish and used them to identify regulatory regions and transcription factors critical for etsrp expression and <b>angioblast</b> specification from mesoderm. Methods and Results: To investigate the mechanisms that initiate <b>angioblast</b> cell transcription during embryo-genesis, we have performed promoter analysis of the etsrp locus in zebrafish. We describe three enhancer elements sufficient for endothelial gene expression when place in front of a heterologous promoter. The deletion of all 3 regulatory regions led to a near complete loss of endothelial expression from the etsrp promoter. One of the enhancers, located 2. 3 kb upstream of etsrp contains a consensus FOX binding site that binds Foxc 1 a and Foxc 1 b in vitro by EMSA and in vivo using ChIP. Combined knockdown of foxc 1 a/b, using morpholinos, led to a significant decrease in etsrp expression at early developmental stages as measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. Decreased expression of primitive erythrocyte genes scl and gata 1 was also observed, whereas pronephric gene pax 2 a was relatively normal in expression level and pattern. Conclusions: These findings identify mesodermal foxc 1 a/b as a direct upstream regulator of etsrp in angioblasts. This establishes a new molecular link in the process of mesoderm specification into <b>angioblast.</b> (Circ Res. 2012...|$|E
40|$|Endothelial cell–specific {{chemotaxis}} receptor (ECSCR) is a cell surface protein {{expressed by}} blood endothelial cells with roles in endothelial cell migration and signal transduction. We investigated {{the function of}} ecscr {{in the development of}} the zebrafish vasculature. Zebrafish ecscr is expressed in angioblasts and in axial vessels during <b>angioblast</b> migration and vasculogenesis. Morpholino-directed ecscr knockdown resulted in defective <b>angioblast</b> migration in the posterior lateral plate mesoderm, a process known to depend on vascular endothelial-derived growth factor (VEGF). In cultured cells, transfected ECSCR localized to actin-rich membrane protrusions, colocalizing with kinase insert domain protein receptor (KDR) /VEGF receptor 2 in these regions. ECSCR-silenced cells show reduced VEGF-induced phosphorylation of KDR but not of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT 1) /VEGF receptor 1. Finally, chemical inhibition of VEGF receptor activity in zebrafish resulted in <b>angioblast</b> deficiencies that partially overlap with those seen in ecscr morphants.

40|$|Recent lineage {{studies suggest}} that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) may be derived from endothelial cells. However, the genetic {{hierarchy}} governing the emergence of HSCs remains elusive. We report here that zebrafish ets 1 -related protein (etsrp), which is essential for vascular endothelial development, also plays {{a critical role in}} the initiation of definitive hematopoiesis by controlling the expression of 2 stem cell leukemia (scl) isoforms (scl-α and scl-β) in angioblasts. In etsrp morphants, which are deficient in endothelial and HSC development, scl-α alone partially rescues <b>angioblast</b> specification, arterial-venous differentiation, and the expression of HSC markers, runx 1 and c-myb, whereas scl-β requires <b>angioblast</b> rescue by fli 1 a to restore runx 1 expression. Interestingly, when vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) signaling is inhibited, HSC marker expression can still be restored by scl-α in etsrp morphants, whereas the rescue of arterial ephrinb 2 a expression is blocked. Furthermore, both scl isoforms partially rescue runx 1 but not ephrinb 2 a expression in embryos deficient in Vegf signaling. Our data suggest that downstream of etsrp, scl-α and fli 1 a specify the angioblasts, whereas scl-β further initiates HSC specification from this <b>angioblast</b> population, and that Vegf signaling acts upstream of scl-β during definitive hematopoiesis...|$|E

40|$|SummaryCurrently, {{it remains}} {{controversial}} how vascular endothelial progenitor cells (<b>angioblasts)</b> establish their arterial or venous fates. We show using zebrafish that the arterial progenitors {{of the major}} axial vessels originate earlier {{and closer to the}} midline than the venous progenitors. Both medial and lateral progenitor populations migrate to distinct arterial and venous positions and not into a common precursor vessel as previously suggested. Overexpression of VEGF or Hedgehog (Hh) homologs results in the partially randomized distribution of arterial and venous progenitors within the axial vessels. We further demonstrate that the function of the Etv 2 transcription factor is required at earlier stages for arterial development than for venous. Our results argue that the medial <b>angioblasts</b> undergo arterial differentiation because they receive higher concentration of Vegf and Hh morphogens than the lateral <b>angioblasts.</b> We propose a revised model of arterial-venous differentiation that explains how <b>angioblasts</b> choose between an arterial and venous fate...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe <b>angioblast</b> is an {{embryonic}} {{endothelial cell}} precursor that migrates long distances {{to reach its}} final position, navigating by sensing attractive and repulsive cues from the environment. Members of the semaphorin family have been implicated in controlling the behaviour of <b>angioblast</b> tip cells through repulsive signalling in vitro, but their in vivo roles are less clear. Here we show that zebrafish semaphorin 3 e (sema 3 e) is expressed by endothelial cells of the dorsal aorta, primary motoneurons, and endodermal cells. Further, loss of Sema 3 e leads to delayed exit of angioblasts from the dorsal aorta in ISV formation. Through transplant analysis, we show that Sema 3 e acts autonomously and non-autonomously in angioblasts to modulate interactions among themselves. The semaphorin receptors, PlexinD 1 and PlexinB 2, are expressed by zebrafish angioblasts. Loss of plxnB 2 results in delayed ISV sprouting identical to that seen in sema 3 e morphants, while loss of plexinD 1 in out of bounds (obd) mutants results in precocious ISV sprouting. Loss of either sema 3 e or plxnB 2 in obd mutants generates an intermediate phenotype, suggesting that PlxnD 1 and Sema 3 e/PlxnB 2 antagonize each other to control timing of ISV sprouting. Consistent with this observation, we show that PlxnB 2 acts cell autonomously in endothelial cells. This suggests a model where multiple semaphorin–plexin interactions control <b>angioblast</b> sprouting behaviour...|$|E
40|$|A key {{step in the}} de novo {{formation}} of the embryonic vasculature is the migration of endothelial precursors, the angioblasts, {{to the position of}} the future vessels. To form the first axial vessels, angioblasts migrate towards the midline and coalesce underneath the notochord. Vascular endothelial growth factor has been proposed to serve as a chemoattractant for the angioblasts and to regulate this medial migration. Here we challenge this model and instead demonstrate that angioblasts rely on their intrinsic expression of Apelin receptors (Aplr, APJ) for their migration to the midline. We further show that during this <b>angioblast</b> migration Apelin receptor signaling is mainly triggered by the recently discovered ligand Elabela (Ela). As neither of the ligands Ela or Apelin (Apln) nor their receptors have previously been implicated in regulating <b>angioblast</b> migration, we hereby provide a novel mechanism for regulating vasculogenesis, with direct relevance to physiological and pathological angiogenesi...|$|E

40|$|AbstractVascular {{development}} {{requires the}} assembly of precursor cells into blood vessels, but how embryonic vessels are assembled is not well understood. To determine how vascular cells migrate and assemble into vessels of the trunk and limb, marked somite-derived <b>angioblasts</b> were followed in developing embryos. Injection of avian somites with the cell-tracker DiI showed that somite-derived <b>angioblasts</b> in unperturbed embryos migrated extensively and contributed to trunk and limb vessels. Mouse–avian chimeras with mouse presomitic mesoderm grafts had graft-derived endothelial cells in blood vessels at significant distances from the graft, indicating that mouse <b>angioblasts</b> migrated extensively in avian hosts. Mouse graft-derived endothelial cells were consistently found in trunk vessels, such as the perineural vascular plexus, the cardinal vein, and presumptive intersomitic vessels, {{as well as in}} vessels of the limb and kidney rudiment. This reproducible pattern of graft colonization suggests that avian vascular patterning cues for trunk and limb vessels are recognized by mammalian somitic <b>angioblasts.</b> Mouse–quail chimeras stained with both the quail vascular marker QH 1 and the mouse vascular marker PECAM- 1 had finely chimeric vessels, with graft-derived mouse cells interdigitated with quail vascular cells in most vascular beds colonized by graft cells. Thus, diverse trunk and limb blood vessels have endothelial cells that developed from migratory somitic <b>angioblasts,</b> and assembly of these vessels is likely to have a large vasculogenic component...|$|R
40|$|Normal human retinal {{vascular}} development uses angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, both {{of which}} are interrupted in the vaso-obliteration phase of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Canine oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) closely resembles human ROP. Canine retinal endothelial cells (ECs) and <b>angioblasts</b> were used to model OIR and characterize the effects of hyperoxia on angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Cell cycle analysis showed that hyperoxia reduced the number of G 1 phase cells and showed increased arrest in S phase for both cell types. Migration of ECs was significantly inhibited in hyperoxia (P < 0. 01). Hyperoxia disrupted the cytoskeleton of <b>angioblasts</b> but not ECs after 2 days. Differentiation of <b>angioblasts</b> into ECs (determined by acetylated low-density lipoprotein uptake) was evaluated after basic fibroblast growth factor treatment.

Many researchers have attempted to determine their origins and development; however, the detailed, stepwise process of ocular vasculature formation has not been established. In zebrafish, two <b>angioblast</b> clusters, the rostral and midbrain organizing centers, form {{almost all of the}} cranial vasculature, including the ocular vasculature, and these are from where the cerebral arterial and venous <b>angioblast</b> clusters, respectively, differentiate. In this study, we first determined the anatomical architecture of the primary ocular vasculature and then followed its path from the two cerebral <b>angioblast</b> clusters using a time-lapse analysis of living Tg(flk 1 :EGFP) k 7 zebrafish embryos, in which the endothelial cells specifically expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein. We succeeded in capturing images of the primary ocular vasculature formation and were able to determine the origin of each ocular vessel. In zebrafish, the hyaloid and ciliary arterial systems first organized independently, and then anastomosed via the inner optic circle {{on the surface of the}} lens by the lateral transfer of the optic vein. Finally, the choroidal vascular plexus formed around the eyeball to complete the primary ocular vasculature formation. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report successful capture of circular integration of the optic artery and vein, lateral transfer of the optic vein to integrate the hyaloidal and superficial ocular vasculatures, and formation of the choroidal vascular plexus.

Identify key genes involved in the origin of hemangiomas. BACKGROUND: Hemangiomas of infancy are common endothelial tumors. They differ from vascular malformations in their tissue architecture and biological properties. To date, there is no universally accepted theory that explains the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of hemangiomas. METHODS: Theories from the medical literature from 1981 to 2004 were gathered, categorized, and reviewed. RESULTS: Current research is mostly on the cellular and genetic levels.

Analysis revealed that p-eNOS(S 1177) but not P-eNOS(S 617) or P-eNOS(T 495) was expressed in a subpopulation of angioblasts (TAL- 1 +/Flk- 1 +/CD 31 −/CD 34 −/VE-Cadherin−) at 7. 2 dpc. A role of the VEGF/Akt 1 /eNOS signaling pathway in the regulation of the endothelial cell (EC) lineage was suggested by the strong correlation observed between cell division and p-eNOS(S 1177) expression in both angioblasts and embryonic endothelial cells (EECs, TAL- 1 +/Flk- 1 +/CD 31 +/CD 34 +/VE-Cadherin+). Our studies using Akt 1 null mouse embryos show a reduction in p-eNOS(S 1177) expression in <b>angioblast</b> and EECs that is correlated with a decrease in endothelial cell proliferation and results in changes in VEGF-induced vascular patterning. Further, we show that VEGF-mediated cell proliferation in Flk- 1 + cells in allantoic cultures is decreased by pharmacological inhibitors of the VEGF/Akt 1 /eNOS signaling pathways.

Expression of all vascular endothelial molecular markers tested was severely reduced in etsrp morphants, whereas hematopoietic markers were not affected.

Consequently Prof. Shikinami gave me the problem on the first appearance and the further developmental stages of the heart primordia in the amphibia, especially on the difference between these two species of the amphibia (urodela and anura). From many embryos, thirteen giant salamanders and twelve toads were selected and used for this study. A large majority of them were fixed in Zenker's fluid, and stained with borax carmine. After the subsequent treatments in the usual manner, these specimens were embedded in paraffin, trimmed and cut in transverse serial sections with a thickness of ten microns. A number of models were prepared according to Born-Peter's method of wax-plate reconstruction. From the results of these experiments, the following summary and conclusions may be made: 1) The heart primordia in the amphibia is formed from the bilateral primordia which are derived from the cardiogenic plate. 2) In the giant salamander, the pericardial cavity and the <b>angioblast</b> first appear in an embryo with 12 - 13 somites, and the ventral and the dorsal mesocardium are first formed in 17 and 20 somites stages respectively. The ventral mesocardium is more defined than that of the toad. The bending of the heart is first indicated in an embryo with 22 - 23 somites and the blood-corpuscles first appear in the heart in the 28 - 29 somite stage. 3) In the toad, the pericardial cavity first appears in an embryo with 8 somites and it is earlier than the first appearance of the <b>angioblast,</b> since the latter is first distinguishable in the 5 - 6 somite stage. The formation and the rupture of the ventral and the dorsal mesocardium are indicated a little earlier than in the giant salamander.

40|$|AbstractCorneal avascularity is {{important}} for optical clarity and normal vision. However, the molecular mechanisms that prevent <b>angioblast</b> migration and vascularization of the developing cornea are not clear. Previously we showed that periocular angioblasts and forming ocular blood vessels avoid the presumptive cornea despite dynamic ingression of neural crest cells. In the current study, we investigate the role of Semaphorin 3 A (Sema 3 A), a cell guidance chemorepellent, on <b>angioblast</b> migration and corneal avascularity during development. We show that Sema 3 A, Vegf, and Nrp 1 are expressed in the anterior eye during cornea development. Sema 3 A mRNA transcripts are expressed at significantly higher levels than Vegf in the lens that is positioned adjacent to the presumptive cornea. Blockade of Sema 3 A signaling via lens removal or injection of a synthetic Sema 3 A inhibitor causes ectopic migration of angioblasts into the cornea and results in its subsequent vascularization. In addition, using bead implantation, we demonstrate that exogenous Sema 3 A protein inhibits Vegf-induced vascularization of the cornea. In agreement with these findings, loss of Sema/Nrp 1 signaling in Nrp 1 Sema− mutant mice results in ectopic angioblasts and vascularization of the embryonic mouse corneas. Altogether, our results reveal Sema 3 A signaling as an important cue during the establishment of corneal avascularity in both chick and mouse embryos. Our study introduces cornea development as a new model for studying the mechanisms involved in vascular patterning during embryogenesis and it also provides new insights into therapeutic potential for Sema 3 A in neovascular diseases...|$|E

Here, we investigated the cell-autonomous mechanism of Hh signaling in <b>angioblasts</b> (endothelial progenitor cells) during arterial–venous specification utilizing zebrafish mutations in Smoothened (Smo), a G protein-coupled receptor essential for Hh signaling. smo mutants exhibit an absence of the dorsal aorta accompanied by a reciprocal expansion of the posterior cardinal vein. The increased number of venous cells is equivalent to the loss of arterial cells in embryos with loss of Smo function. Activation of Hh signaling expands the arterial cell population at the expense of venous cell fate. Time-lapse imaging reveals two sequential waves of migrating progenitor cells that contribute to the dorsal aorta and the posterior cardinal vein, respectively. <b>Angioblasts</b> deficient in Hh signaling fail to contribute to the arterial wave; instead, they all migrate medially as a single population to form the venous wave. Cell transplantation analyses demonstrate that Smo plays a cell-autonomous role in specifying <b>angioblasts</b> to become arterial cells, and Hh signaling-depleted <b>angioblasts</b> differentiate into venous cells instead.

Whether resident <b>angioblasts</b> or endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to human retinal vasculogenesis is still a matter of controversy. To address this controversy, fetal human retinas of 6 - 23 weeks gestation (WG) were examined using immunohistochemistry and a panel of antibodies against endothelial cell markers (CD 34, CD 31), a marker for retinal <b>angioblasts</b> and endothelium (CD 39 /ecto-ADPase), and a marker for precursors and hemangioblasts (CXCR 4). Confocal microscopic spectral analysis and double labeling with Ki 67 was used to identify the proliferating cell types. In the inner neuroblastic layer of the 6 - 8 WG retina and in the putative ganglion cell layer in avascular regions of older eyes (14 WG- 20 WG), scattered CD 39 + <b>angioblasts</b> were {{well in advance of}} forming vasculature. There was a layer of CXCR 4 + cells in the inner retina that was reduced in size with development. As blood vessels formed, CD 39 + cells were always well in advance of the vascular front and they expressed CXCR 4. This demonstrates that a pool of resident <b>angioblasts</b> express CD 39 and CXCR 4 as they differentiate and participate in vasculogenesis in the fetal human. They retain expression of CD 39 as endothelial cells in the newly formed retinal vasculature but they down-regulate CXCR 4 expression...|$|R
40|$|During {{embryonic}} vasculogenesis, endothelial {{precursor cells}} of mesodermal origin known as <b>angioblasts</b> assemble into a characteristic network pattern. Although {{a considerable amount}} of markers and signals involved in this process have been identified, the mechanisms underlying the coalescence of <b>angioblasts</b> into this reticular pattern remain unclear. Various recent studies hypothesize that autocrine regulation of the chemoattractant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is responsible for the formation of vascular networks in vitro. However, the autocrine regulation hypothesis does not fit well with reported data on in vivo early vascular development. In this study, we propose a mathematical model based on the alternative assumption that endodermal VEGF signalling activity, having a paracrine effect on adjacent <b>angioblasts,</b> is mediated by its binding to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Detailed morphometric analysis of simulated networks and images obtained from in vivo quail embryos reveals the model mimics the vascular patterns with high accuracy. These results show that paracrine signalling can result in the formation of fine-grained cellular networks when mediated by angioblast-produced ECM. This lends additional support to the theory that patterning during early vascular development i...|$|R
40|$|Most {{studies on}} kidney {{development}} {{have considered the}} interaction of the metanephric mesenchyme and the ureteric bud to be the major inductive event that maintains tubular differentiation and branching morphogenesis. The mesenchyme produces Gdnf, which stimulates branching, and the ureteric bud stimulates continued growth of the mesenchyme and differentiation of nephrons from the induced mesenchyme. Null mutation of the Wt 1 gene eliminates outgrowth of the ureteric bud, but Gdnf has been identified as a target of Pax 2, but not of Wt 1. Using a novel system for microinjecting and electroporating plasmid expression constructs into murine organ cultures, it has been demonstrated that Vegfa expression in the mesenchyme is regulated by Wt 1. Previous studies had identified a population of Flk 1 -expressing cells in the periphery of the induced mesenchyme, and adjacent to the stalk of the ureteric bud, and that Vegfa was able to stimulate growth of kidneys in organ culture. Here it is demonstrated that signaling through Flk 1 is required to maintain expression of Pax 2 in the mesenchyme of the early kidney, and for Pax 2 to stimulate expression of Gdnf. However, once Gdnf stimulates branching of the ureteric bud, the Flk 1 -dependent <b>angioblast</b> signal is no longer required to maintain branching morphogenesis and induction of nephrons. Thus, this work demonstrates the presence of a second set of inductive events, involving the mesenchymal and <b>angioblast</b> populations, whereby Wt 1 -stimulated expression of Vegfa elicits an as-yet-unidentified signal from the angioblasts, which is required to stimulate the expression of Pax 2 and Gdnf, which in turn elicits an inductive signal from the ureteric bud...|$|E
40|$|Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are fibroblastoid cells {{capable of}} {{long-term}} expansion and skeletogenic differentiation. While MSCs {{are known to}} originate from neural crest and mesoderm, immediate mesodermal precursors {{that give rise to}} MSCs have not been characterized. Recently, using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), we demonstrated that mesodermal MSCs arise from APLNR+ precursors with angiogenic potential, mesenchymoangioblasts, which can be identified by FGF 2 -dependent colony-forming assay in serum-free semisolid medium. In this overview we provide additional insights on cellular pathways leading to MSC establishment from mesoderm, with special emphasis on endothelial-mesenchymal transition as a critical step in MSC formation. In addition, we highlight an essential role of FGF 2 in induction of angiogenic cells with potential to transform into MSCs (mesenchymoangioblasts) or hematopoietic cells (hemangioblasts) from mesoderm, and discuss correlations of our in vitro findings with the course of <b>angioblast</b> development during embryogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Novel {{regenerative}} therapies may {{stem from}} {{deeper understanding of the}} mechanisms governing cardiovascular lineage diversification. Using enhancer mapping and live imaging in avian embryos, and genetic lineage tracing in mice, we investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of cardiovascular progenitor populations. We show that expression of the cardiac transcription factor Nkx 2. 5 marks a mesodermal population outside of the cardiac crescent in the extraembryonic and lateral plate mesoderm, with characteristics of hemogenic angioblasts. Extra-cardiac Nkx 2. 5 lineage progenitors migrate into the embryo and contribute to clusters of CD 41 /CD 45 and RUNX 1 cells in the endocardium, the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region of the dorsal aorta and liver. We also demonstrated that ectopic expression of Nkx 2. 5 in chick embryos activates the hemoangiogenic gene expression program. Taken together, we identified a hemogenic <b>angioblast</b> cell lineage characterized by transient Nkx 2. 5 expression that contributes to hemogenic endothelium and endocardium, suggesting a novel role for Nkx 2. 5 in hemoangiogenic lineage specification and diversification...|$|E

40|$|AbstractVascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) is a {{secreted}} mitogen which specifically stimulates proliferation of vascular endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Its expression pattern {{is consistent with}} it being an important regulator of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, and targeted disruption of VEGF-A has demonstrated that {{it is essential for}} vascular development. To determine if VEGF-A was sufficient to alter vascularization in the eye we generated transgenic mice which express human VEGF-A 165 specifically in the lens. Expression of transgenic VEGF-A led to excessive proliferation and accumulation of disorganized <b>angioblasts</b> and endothelial cells around the lens. The results support the hypothesis that VEGF-A can initiate the process of vascularization by stimulating chemoattraction and proliferation of <b>angioblasts</b> and endothelial cells and that VEGF-A expression can stimulate angiogenic remodeling. However, VEGF-A alone was not sufficient to direct blood vessel organization or maturation...|$|R
40|$|In vertebrates, {{molecular}} mechanisms dictate angioblasts' {{migration and}} subsequent differentiation into arteries and veins. In this study, {{we used a}} microarray screen to identify a novel member of the sucrose nonfermenting related kinase (snrk- 1) family of serine/threonine kinases expressed specifically in the embryonic zebrafish vasculature and investigated its function in vivo. Using gain- and loss-of-function studies in vivo, we show that Snrk- 1 plays {{an essential role in}} the migration, maintenance, and differentiation of <b>angioblasts.</b> The kinase function of Snrk- 1 is critical for migration and maintenance, but not for the differentiation of <b>angioblasts.</b> In vitro, snrk- 1 knockdown endothelial cells show only defects in migration. The snrk- 1 gene acts downstream or parallel to notch and upstream of gridlock during artery-vein specification, and the human gene compensates for zebrafish snrk- 1 knockdown, suggesting evolutionary conservation of function...|$|R
