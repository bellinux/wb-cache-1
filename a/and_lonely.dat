He turns into a bitter, arrogant, <b>and</b> <b>lonely</b> man after finding that the fame does not fill the void in his life. Khatana is now his manager, but fails to control him, and Jordan is constantly involved in fights with the media and fans. Inspite of all this, he remains a highly popular artist.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the Gascoignes' third child, {{daughter}} Hester, was born. Like many Observatory personnel, the Gascoignes {{lived in}} a staff residence on Mount Stromlo, which was a long difficult trip away from Canberra. It was cold <b>and</b> <b>lonely,</b> particularly for Rosalie, but they enjoyed the outdoors, and the landscape inspired Rosalie's creativity and later her artistic career. In 1960 they relocated to Deakin in suburban Canberra, and in the late 1960s they moved to another suburb, Pearce.|$|E

5|$|Most of Tender Mercies {{was filmed}} in Waxahachie and Palmer, two towns in Ellis County in north central Texas. Beresford largely avoided the Victorian {{architecture}} and other picturesque elements of Waxahachie and instead focused on relatively barren locations more characteristic of West Texas. The town {{portrayed in the}} film is never identified by name. Foote said when he wrote the script {{he did not have}} the same isolated <b>and</b> <b>lonely</b> vision for the setting Beresford did, but he felt the atmosphere the director captured served the story well.|$|E

5|$|Aged 76, {{he faced}} various ailments, and {{although}} exhibiting continued energy, he felt isolated <b>and</b> <b>lonely.</b> He often entertained celebrities, such as Michael Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, and the Spice Girls, and befriended ultra-rich businessmen, like Harry Oppenheimer of Anglo-American {{as well as}} Queen Elizabeth II on her March 1995 state visit to South Africa, resulting in strong criticism from ANC anti-capitalists. Despite his opulent surroundings, Mandela lived simply, donating {{a third of his}} R 552,000 annual income to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, which he had founded in 1995. Although dismantling press censorship, speaking out in favour of freedom of the press, and befriending many journalists, Mandela was critical of much of the country's media, noting that it was overwhelmingly owned and run by middle-class whites and believing that it focused too heavily on scaremongering about crime.|$|E

5|$|Bonifácio was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian. PedroII spent his days studying, with only two hours set aside for amusements. Intelligent, {{he was able to}} acquire knowledge with great ease. However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave PedroII an unhappy <b>and</b> <b>lonely</b> upbringing. The environment in which he was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw books as a refuge and retreat from the real world.|$|E

Eventually, with Jessica's prodding, Dain is persuaded to rescue the neglected boy from his mother's clutches. While doing so, the Marquess comes to terms with his mother's abandonment and realizes that Dominick is just as scared <b>and</b> <b>lonely</b> as he was as a boy. Dominick is invited to live at the Ballister estate, while the boy's mother, to her pleasure, is given a large stipend and told to find her fortune in Paris.|$|E

60|$|The trail, {{hardly more}} than a wood road, grew wilder <b>and</b> <b>lonelier</b> as they climbed. Cattle fed on the hillsides in {{scattered}} bands like elk.

5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Carey and Diane Martel {{during the spring of}} 1998. The music video begins with Carey sitting alone in a limousine, recalling a night she shared some time previous. As scenes of Carey reminiscing in the limo are shown, clips of her dressing in an old apartment are presented. Eventually, Carey joins a roof-top party one night, where she begins dancing and caressing her lover. As the passion between them grown, rain begins to fall, showering everyone atop the edifice. As these scenes end, Carey in the present opens the sun-roof of the limo and stands into the rainy night, trying to recapture those magical moments she shared on that rainy roof-top encounter. The video ends with a wet Carey lying {{in the back of the}} limousine, sad <b>and</b> <b>lonely.</b>|$|E
5|$|The game's plot {{describes}} {{a journey through}} a child's emotions and anxieties. After befriending the monster, the boy leaves Earth on the creature's back to look for life elsewhere in the galaxy. He hopes {{to find someone to}} relate to. The hollow planet Gravida's surface is patrolled by a creature that complains of stomach pains. This larger creature is followed by several tiny creatures, some of which ride on its back. One of these smaller inhabitants has fallen into the core of Gravida. Though it is isolated <b>and</b> <b>lonely,</b> the creature consoles itself that nobody can harm it. The planet Malaisus is composed of water, with a monster identical to the player's swimming around with a shoal of fish. The monster tells the player to leave. Planet Bibulon has two faces on opposite sides, one angry and one happy. A two-faced creature travels across the surface; one is happy and the other morose. Bibulon is orbited by four moons, each of which has differing opinions on an unnamed man or boy. When players find the planet Debasa, they discover that it is surrounded by a green fog. Gravity is very intense within the fog. Four orbiting satellites produce the fog, which has trapped two boys. Earth shrinks slightly after each planet has been completed. After restoring color to all the surrounding planets, the game is completed by returning to Earth. The Earth has shrunk until it is only slightly larger than the monster; it is destroyed when the boy and his monster land. Both fly upwards and land on the moon, where the boy is free to craft a future of his choosing.|$|E

By emotionally supporting a struggling relative and seeking help from a doctor or counselor, the forgetfulness can be improved.|$|E

The character was often seen to be “shunted aside by stronger personalities”, such as her best friend Bianca – who was shown to bully and torment Natalie, telling her “that she was plain and wouldn't attract boys”, although in later years Natalie was shown to stand up to Bianca’s bullying.|$|E
