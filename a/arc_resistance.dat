40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we report}} the {{packaging}} of thin film thermocouples (TFT) using <b>resistance</b> <b>arc</b> welding technique. Par-allel gap welding and spot welding {{have been reported}} in the liter-ature for attaching thin wires to metal thin films. To the knowl-edge of the authors, this is the first time <b>resistance</b> <b>arc</b> welding has been reported as a packaging technique for microfabricated devices. A brief description of the microfabrication process and chemical analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the vapor deposited alloy constituents for the TFT are reported in this study. K-type (chromel and alumel) thermocouple wires were used as targets for physical vapor deposition of the compo-nent layers of the TFT. The calibration of the TFT using high-speed data acquisition is reported. The calibration curves of TFT packaged using ultrasonic wire bonding of Al wires are compared with TFT packaged using <b>resistance</b> <b>arc</b> welding of K-type thermo-couple wires.

5000|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of the incandescent light bulb, arc lamps were used to light the streets. They created light using an electrical arc between two carbon electrodes. These lamps often produced audible humming, hissing, or even howling sounds. In 1899 Duddell, a student of William Ayrton at London Central Technical College, was asked by Ayrton to look into this problem. The sounds were created by instabilities in the current caused by the <b>arc's</b> negative <b>resistance.</b> Duddell connected a tuned circuit consisting of an inductor and capacitor across an <b>arc.</b> The negative <b>resistance</b> of the <b>arc</b> excited audio frequency oscillations in the tuned circuit at its resonant frequency, which could be heard as a musical tone coming from the arc. Duddell used his oscillograph to determine the precise conditions required to produce oscillations. To demonstrate his invention before the London Institution of Electrical Engineers, he wired a keyboard to produce different tones from the arc, and used it to play a tune, God Save the Queen {{making it one of the}} first examples of electronic music. This device, which became known as the [...] "singing arc", was one of the first electronic oscillators.|$|R

5000|$|An {{electric}} arc {{over the surface}} of plastics causes their degradation. A conductive carbon-rich track tends to form in the arc path, negatively influencing their insulation properties. The arc susceptibility is tested according to ASTM D495, by point electrodes and continuous and intermittent arcs; it is measured in seconds required to form a track that is conductive under high-voltage low-current conditions. Some materials are less susceptible to degradation than others. For example, polytetrafluoroethylene has <b>arc</b> <b>resistance</b> of about 200 seconds (3.3 minutes). From thermosetting plastics, alkyds and melamine resins are better than phenolic resins. Polyethylenes have <b>arc</b> <b>resistance</b> of about 150 seconds; polystyrenes and polyvinyl chlorides have relatively low resistance of about 70 seconds.
