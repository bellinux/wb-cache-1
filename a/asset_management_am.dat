40|$|<b>Asset</b> <b>management</b> (<b>AM)</b> {{processes}} play {{an important}} role in assisting enterprises to manage their assets more efficiently. To visualise and improve AM processes, the processes need to be modelled using certain process modelling methodologies. Understanding the requirements for AM process modelling is essential for selecting or developing effective AM process modelling methodologies. However, little research has been done on analysing the requirements. This paper attempts to fill this gap by investigating the features of AM processes. It is concluded that AM process modelling requires intuitive representation of its processes, ‘fast’ implementation of the process modelling, effective evaluation of the processes and sound system integration. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Data Quality (DQ) is a {{critical}} issue for effective asset management. DQ problems can result in severe negative consequences for an organisation. Several research {{studies have indicated that}} most organizations have DQ problems. This paper aims to explore DQ issues associated with the implementation of Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) systems. The study applies a DQ research framework for <b>Asset</b> <b>Management</b> (<b>AM)</b> in a preliminary case study of two large Australian utility organisations. The findings of the study suggest that the importance of DQ issues for the implementation of EAM systems is often overlooked; thus, {{there is a need for}} more scrutinised studies in order to raise general awareness...|$|E
40|$|Asset {{managers}} (AMRs) {{have long}} struggled to influence others within their organisations to support <b>Asset</b> <b>Management</b> (<b>AM)</b> practices. This dilemma was further highlighted with {{the issuance of}} the AM suite of standards, ISO 55000. This paper explores an alternative approach to existing influence and change management approaches. Social psychology, and more specifically Robert Cialdini’s ‘six principles of persuasion’, have benefited advertisers, lawyers, and even waiters in their respective professions, by helping them to influence others and induce compliance. Fortunately, AMRs can now do the same. Implementing these principles offers numerous advantages and requires small, practical, and often costless changes {{that can make a}} large difference to their ability to influence and persuade others in an ethical way...|$|E

A research methodology for the development and validation of an AM DQ framework is also presented. As AM data and informational needs are very different to a typical business environment, a gap also exists in the availability of DQ solutions for engineering asset management...|$|E

The research design involved four steps. The first two steps are explorative and descriptive, and explore how the management of infrastructure assets is understood. We do so by reviewing the relevant literature and the agency’s practical context regarding the management of infrastructure assets.

The main fundamentals to be considered to properly implement AM within production companies according to the existing literature and standards are identified and they are: two dimensions - i. e., the asset life cycle (Beginning of Life, Middle of Life, End of Life phases) and the hierarchical level of the asset-control activities (strategic level, tactical level, operational level) - and four funding principles - i. e., life cycle orientation, system orientation, risk orientation and asset-centric orientation. An empirical investigation is then developed through multiple case-study involving eight production companies in Italy, in order to assess the level of orientation towards those funding principles within production companies as it is nowadays, in order to identify existing gaps and areas for improvements...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a generic framework for asset maintenance management. The framework has been presented {{in the form of an}} IDEF 0 process model. The process model served to illustrate the interaction and dependencies among a diverse set of knowledge areas. In this framework, outputs from one management process become inputs to another in a subsequent hierarchy. The structure of the framework model exhibited the characteristics of flexibility and robustness. Updates in knowledge can be accommodated within the framework through incorporating new management processes and/or activities, as well as establishing new sequencing logic for these processes and/or activities. In a supporting effort to the development of the framework model, the writers have objectively reviewed the general capabilities of three commercially available software applications that are known within the <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> (<b>AM)</b> industry. These three applications, while encompassing a wide selection of capabilities, represent a typical selection of information technology (IT) tools and techniques that are widely used in strategic AM practices.

40|$|This paper {{serves as}} a guide for {{researchers}} in <b>Asset</b> <b>Management</b> (<b>AM).</b> Its objective is to establish sufficient reasoning to select and complement research methodologies for AM research studies. It explores literature and adds to existing research approaches in AM. This will lead to a stronger body of knowledge through a better contribution from research. AM as a discipline, addresses the management of the life cycle of assets utilized by an organisation. This extends from identification of the need to the disposal and liability thereafter. It includes technical and business activities. From this view, AM is a relatively new discipline. The nature of the AM activities is both interdisciplinary and cross functional. It has been found that most reported {{research in the area of}} AM focuses on specific functions and technical activities such as maintenance. Often it is either not apparent that a particular research method has been used, or, not is explicitly identified. Combining case study methods with a retroductive research strategy yields suitable methodologies for improving the research process in AM...|$|E
40|$|The multivariate asset {{management}} assessment topography (MAMAT) {{was developed to}} quantify, and represent graphically, development, adoption, and performance of a business ’ <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> (<b>AM)</b> systems, as described by standards such as PAS 55. The MAMAT provides a way to visualise clearly {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of a business ’ {{asset management}} system. Building on MAMAT, a model describing the relationship between the commitment of resources and the corresponding improvement in the MAMAT assessment outcome is proposed. The goal is to develop an optimisation model that will maximise financial benefits by improving the MAMAT assessment score achieved by a business, while minimising the investment required to attain this improvement. This is achieved by determining the optimal allocation of resources to the different subcategories of the MAMAT assessment framework. The multi-objective cross-entropy method (MOO CEM) is used to find the Pareto set of solutions for this problem. In order to showcase the intended industry application and use of the optimisation model, a hypothetical case study is executed and described in this paper. From this application, it was found that the MOO CE...|$|E
