5|$|Operation Flax was a Western Allied air {{operation}} executed during the Tunisia Campaign, {{as part of}} the larger North African Campaign of the Second World War. The operation was designed to cut the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> lines between Italy and the Axis armies in Tunis, Tunisia, in April 1943. The parallel Allied naval effort was Operation Retribution.|$|E
5|$|Breathing <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> {{can come}} {{directly}} from a high-pressure breathing air compressor, from a high-pressure storage system, or from a combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will be limited by the available power source and capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.|$|E
40|$|Both {{analytical}} and the numerical {{methods have been}} developed to compares the energy performance of the OAHU systems and the two-AHU (TAHU) system. The OAHU system saves up to 1. 85 kilojoules heating energy for each kilogram <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> to the building, or 0. 8 Btu for each pound <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> to the building when the outside air dew point temperature is less than the room dew point temperature. When the outside air dew point temperature is higher than the room dew point temperature, the OAHU system saves up to 4. 65 kilojoules heating and cooling energy for each kilogram <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> to the building, or 2 Btu for each pound <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> to the building. Both OAHU and TAHU consume the same amount of fan energy. The paper presents the system models, the simulation procedures and the simulation results...|$|R

5|$|Divers {{may carry}} one {{cylinder}} or multiples, {{depending on the}} requirements of the dive. Where diving takes place in low risk areas, where the diver may safely make a free ascent, or where a buddy is available to provide an alternative <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> in an emergency, recreational divers usually carry only one cylinder. Where diving risks are higher, for example where the visibility is low or when recreational divers do deeper or decompression diving, and particularly when diving under an overhead, divers routinely carry more than one gas source.|$|E
5|$|In late 1941, Luftflotte 2 {{supported}} the final German offensive against Moscow, codenamed Operation Typhoon. Raids on Moscow proved hazardous, as Moscow had good all-weather airfields and opposition from both fighters and anti-aircraft guns {{was similar to}} that encountered over Britain. The bad weather that hampered ground operations from October on impeded air operations even more. Nonetheless, Luftflotte 2 continued to fly critical reconnaissance, interdiction, close air support and <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> missions.|$|E
5|$|Mario's health {{consists}} of a three-piece health meter, which is depleted through contact with enemies and hazards. When swimming underwater, Mario has an <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> meter, which quickly depletes his main health meter if it runs out. Mario's health and <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> can be restored by collecting coins, or through touching bubbles if underwater. When the health meter becomes empty, the player loses a life and must {{go back to a}} predetermined checkpoint. The health meter can be temporarily expanded to six units {{through the use of a}} Life Mushroom, with the maximum health returning to three units if the overall health falls to three units from enemy or hazard contact, or if Mario suffers instant death. Instant death can occur by being swallowed by quicksand or dark matter; falling into bottomless pits, which either consist of black holes or by leaving a planet's gravitational pull and falling into space. The player can obtain extra lives by collecting 1-Up Mushrooms, 50 coins without losing a life, or 50 Star Bits.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{conditioned}} <b>air</b> is <b>supplied</b> {{directly into}} the occupied space, <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> temperatures must be higher than mixing systems (usually above 63 °F or 17 °C) to avoid cold draughts at the floor. By introducing the <b>air</b> at <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> temperatures close to the room temperature and low outlet velocity {{a high level of}} thermal comfort can be provided with displacement ventilation.|$|R

Lead vocalists Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock sang their parts to tracks laid down by American studio musicians. Jeremy Paul, <b>Air</b> <b>Supply's</b> bass player and third lead vocalist was relugated to backing vocal duties for the recording sessions.

5|$|The {{first two}} blocks of JF-17 {{is powered by}} a single Russian RD-93 {{turbofan}} engine, which is a variant of the RD-33 engine used on the MiG-29 fighter. The engine gives more thrust and significantly lower specific fuel consumption than turbojet engines fitted to older combat aircraft being replaced by the JF-17. The advantages of using a single engine are a reduction in maintenance time and cost when compared to twin-engined fighters. A thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.99 can be achieved with full internal fuel tanks and no external payload. The engine's <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> is provided by two bifurcated air inlets (see airframe section).|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{suffering}} {{shortages of}} pilots and equipment, No.84 Wing was generally {{able to keep}} pace with the army's requirements. A detachment of No.36 Squadron, flying C-47 Dakotas, was employed to augment the wing's supply capabilities. Up until the end of June 1945, No.5 Squadron had flown almost 2,000 sorties and No.17 AOP Flight over 1,300, while No.10 Local <b>Air</b> <b>Supply</b> Unit and the No.36 Squadron detachment had accounted for almost 1,000 between them. As the navigational efficiency of the New Zealander pilots increased, demands on the Boomerangs and Wirraways lessened, and the bulk of the reconnaissance duties fell to the Austers of No.17 AOP Flight.|$|E

40|$|Multi-stage {{filtration}} Air-conditioning systems Filtration efficiency An {{important factor}} which reduces {{the quality of}} <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> to a room by an air-conditioning plant is inadequate cleaning of the installation. This fault may exist in tandem with others built in during the design process (e. g. improperly placed filters with too low filtration efficiency). When, in addition to any design errors, the whole system is also badly maintained and the net-work of ducts and conditioning devices are not cleaned this can result {{in an increase in}} the pollution of the <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> to the room. For proper operation of air-conditioning it is necessary to comply with the guidelines concerning cleanliness of ventilation systems. Also, it seems reasonable to include the addition of a multi-stage filtration system, which will decrease the concentra-tion of contaminants in <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> to a room. This article describes a model of the effect of adding a four-stage filtration system to an air-conditioning system...|$|R
5|$|On 22 January {{a native}} {{reported}} seeing seven Japanese {{in the hills}} south west of Sio and a patrol was sent out under Corporal Bengari to investigate. On arriving in the vicinity on 24 January, a local reported that another 22 Japanese had arrived. The next morning, Bengari and his five companions ambushed the Japanese and killed them all before they could fire a shot. Wirraway and Boomerang aircraft of No. 4 Squadron RAAF scouted ahead of the advance. Its aerial reconnaissance work let the Australians and Papuans know where opposition could be expected, thereby speeding up the advance. The pilots noted Japanese parachutes, signs that the Japanese were receiving supplies by air. On 4 February, the Australians were also forced onto <b>air</b> <b>supply,</b> as swollen rivers washed {{out a number of}} bridges.|$|E

5|$|A seizure {{underwater}} {{requires that}} the diver {{be brought to the}} surface as soon as practicable. Although for many years the recommendation has been not to raise the diver during the seizure itself, owing to the danger of arterial gas embolism (AGE), {{there is some evidence that}} the glottis does not fully obstruct the airway. This has led to the current recommendation by the Diving Committee of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society that a diver should be raised during the seizure's clonic (convulsive) phase if the regulator is not in the diver's mouth– as the danger of drowning is then greater than that of AGE– but the ascent should be delayed until the end of the clonic phase otherwise. Rescuers ensure that their own safety is not compromised during the convulsive phase. They then ensure that where the victim's <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> is established it is maintained, and carry out a controlled buoyant lift. Lifting an unconscious body is taught by most diver training agencies. Upon reaching the surface, emergency services are always contacted as there is a possibility of further complications requiring medical attention. The U.S. Navy has procedures for completing the decompression stops where a recompression chamber is not immediately available.|$|E

5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in May 1943 did not signal {{the end of the}} Battle of the Atlantic. Some 60 vessels remained, and posed a threat to convoys. In later months, the Schnorchel, a device {{originated}} by the Dutch and later adopted by the Kriegsmarine after the Germans invaded the Netherlands were capable of allowing a U-boat to replace its <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> and vent its diesel exhaust without surfacing became available. However, it was sensitive to the weather, and put immense pressure and strain on crews who had to remain submerged for long period in hostile waters. Further, Coastal's Mark III radar could detect the mast. The smoke emitted was visible from 1,000 feet. In some cases the mast itself could be seen, some one foot in diameter, projecting two feet and moving at 12–15 knots. The technological response was to use High Tea, a series of sonobuoys dropped by aircraft onto the surface of the sea to detect U-boats. By late 1943, the U-bootwaffe was losing 20 percent of its strength per month. Some 70 percent that did return were seriously damaged.|$|E
5|$|The first air {{transport}} {{mission to the}} Kokoda front was flown on 26 July, when a DC-3 from the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron landed 15 troops of the 39th Infantry Battalion and some stores. A C-53 followed that afternoon with another 15 men and some stores. The flight time to Kokoda was about 20 minutes. An <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> run the following day by a C-53 and a DC-2 found the airstrip barricaded. The barricades were removed, but the aircraft were recalled by a radio message that the Kokoda Drome could not be held. The loss of the airstrip meant a switch to air dropping supplies. An aircraft was sent that afternoon, but was recalled. On 28 July, a DC-5, a DC-3 and a DC-2 dropped supplies near Kokoda. Three transports dropped supplies near Kagi on 29 July, and one on 30 July. No more missions were flown until 6 August.|$|E

On their way back, Aleph and Hiroko learn that the Center has released the demon Abaddon to swallow the entire Valhalla district, and that the Center only plans to let those they deem worthy be allowed {{to live in the}} Thousand-Year Kingdom; everyone else would be abandoned and left to die. Zayin starts a revolt against the Center, who threatens to cut off the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> to the Holytown district if he does not surrender; he, Aleph and Hiroko go to the Center to confront the four elders leading it. Aleph and Hiroko learn that the elders are actually the archangels Michael, Raphael, Uriel and Gabriel; Aleph and Hiroko fight and kill the first three archangels, after which Gabriel reveals that YHVH, the creator god, had ordered the archangels to watch over the creation of Tokyo Millennium and wait for the Messiah, but that Michael, Raphael and Uriel, unable to wait any longer, created Aleph as an artificial, false Messiah, leading YHVH to abandon them; he was the boy Hiroko was searching for, aged unnaturally fast to take on the role of Messiah. Similarly, Beth was artificially created as the Messiah's partner, Zayin as his bodyguard, Daleth as a false savior intended to be defeated by the Messiah so that Aleph would win the people's favor, and Gimmel as a trial Messiah for the Arcadia prototype.|$|E
