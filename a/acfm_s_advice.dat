How many patients were leaving against the doctor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>advice?</b> What was the size of the problem? Did these patients have active or arrested cases of tuberculosis? How many were in need of help from social agencies at the time of discharge or at the time of admission? Were they a source of infection to the community? How long did they stay at the Sanatorium? Were the reasons the patients left within the control of the Sanatorium or beyond the control of the Sanatorium? Other questions were those in connection with the patient 2 ̆ 7 s ability to adjust within the community to which he had returned. What clinic supervision did they have after leaving the Sanatorium? What follow-up was there by the Sanatorium? Did they return to work? If so, was it injurious to their health? What was the patient 2 ̆ 7 s attitude toward his family? To what kind of homes did they return? These and many other questions as well entered into the initial thinking on the study.

40|$|Thomas HardyはGeorge Meredithの「複雑なプロット」をもった作品を書くようにという助言を忠実に守った結果、彼は煽情小説というジャンルを利用したとされ、出版第一作であるDesperate Remediesの評価は必ずしも高くなかったが、最近ではテキストに隠された作者の意図の分析がなされ、評価も見直されている。本論では、それらの評価を踏まえつつ、Desperate Remediesにおける光と闇、雷雨、火事、水、風などの自然描写に見られる様々なひねりに注目し、その意味を考察した。即ち、Hardyはその自然描写の表層を転覆させ、登場人物の心理、状況、そして秘密を暴露することによって、単に深層を探るだけではなく、煽情小説の背後に隠された彼自身のナラティブの策略、即ち、トルクを加えた自然描写を通して示された彼自身の陰謀の役割をも明らかにしているのである。Desperate Remediesは自然描写の点でもMeredithの助言を転覆させており、小説家Hardyの独創性をはっきりと主張した作品となっていると言える。It {{has long}} been a general {{understanding}} that Thomas Hardy, having followed George Meredith 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>advice</b> to attempt a novel with a <complicated plot,< made use of the genre of a sensation novel for his first published work, Desperate Remedies, and that as a result it has not necessarily been highly regarded. However, recent readings of the novel have begun to revise this view by analyzing previously overlooked aspects of the the text. In this paper, taking these new estimations into consideration, I pay attention to various twists used in Hardy 2 ̆ 7 s nature descriptions. For example, light is aways linked with darkness as Cytherea associates ominousness with sunshine, contrary to the general image. Similarly, the wind which causes the fire is described as a twisting element: <one particular whim of Nature,< a <treacherous element. < And a blissful love scene on a boat is subverted by the sea-bottom and even undermines the seemingly happy ending. Thus, Hardy not only plumbs depths by subverting superficialities, exposing characters 2 ̆ 7 psychology, situations and secrets, he also reveals the role of his own narrative plotting behind the plot, his schemes revealed through torques nature descriptions. Desperate Remedies, subverting Meredith 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>advice,</b> clearly shows Hardy 2 ̆ 7 s in-geniousness...|$|R

These results have implications for educational interventions and decision aids that attempt to influence or change the risky decisions of target populations. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Substantial {{research}} links many of {{the defining}} characteristics of primary care to important outcomes; yet {{little is known about}} the relative importance of each characteristic, and several characteristics have not been examined. These analyses evaluate the relationship between seven defining elements of primary care (accessibility, continuity, comprehensiveness, integration, clinical interaction, interpersonal treatment, and trust) and three outcomes (adherence to physician 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>advice,</b> patient satisfaction, and improved health status). METHODS: Data were derived from a cross-sectional observational study of adults employed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (N = 7204).

Participants showed little sensitivity to the cost of advice, further compounding the errors. Requiring participants to request advice on every training trial increased reliance on the later optional expert and led to properties of the expert primarily influencing the decision to request advice. Requiring participants to rely only on the environmental cue during training decreased overall reliance on the later optional expert and led to properties of the environment primarily influencing the decision to request advice.

Our sales law and particularly the law of warranties likewise has changed. Where contract liability has been regarded as inadequate, it has been supplemented by tort law. There is an ever increasing tendency to permit the consumer injured by defective goods or services to reach the producer directly, if not with the help of contract law, then with the help of a revised law of torts. Not only has the decline of the rules of privity permitted the consumer to reach the producer, but product liability, in contrast to the tenets of classical tort law, is straining away from negligence. In a fascinating blending of tort and contract law, product liability increasingly is becoming strict liability. A theory of enterprise liability has emerged, frequently based on vague and unanalyzed notions of public policy and economics...|$|R

The emphasis on consent in the Second Treatise of Government seems to require a parallel emphasis on freedom of thought; but it is the possibility of precisely this sort of freedom that Locke calls into question with a theory of education grounded in the external inculcation of mental habits that control behavior throughout life. This surface tension, however, is dispelled by Locke 2 ̆ 7 s theory of knowledge, as it is expressed in the Essay Concerning Human Understanding. The Essay 2 ̆ 7 s skepticism with regard to an objective and public knowledge makes clear first, that education is reducible to indoctrination; and second, that liberty therefore requires the rejection or fundamental reconstitution of what has been learned. In this light, the Two Treatises are central elements in Locke 2 ̆ 7 s education to “virtue,” which is nothing more than the indoctrination of liberal belief. ...|$|R
