5|$|Equality under Article 12(1) {{does not}} require that <b>all</b> <b>persons</b> are treated alike, but rather that <b>all</b> <b>persons</b> in like {{situations}} should be treated alike. Similarly, failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality. As such, at the second stage the question to be considered is whether persons falling within the same class are treated equally. Article 12(1) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others. However, the law is not unconstitutional if <b>all</b> <b>persons</b> discriminated against are equally discriminated against, and <b>all</b> <b>persons</b> not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against. The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution, whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it. The second stage test was also found to have been satisfied where {{all members of the}} Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally.|$|E
5|$|In {{answering}} {{both questions}} in the negative, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's finding that the statute was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal further clarified Singapore's stance on legislative plenary power and expounded upon Article 12(1) of the Constitution, explaining that the promise of equality {{does not mean that}} <b>all</b> <b>persons</b> are to be treated equally, but simply that <b>all</b> <b>persons</b> in like situations will be treated alike. Drawing on foreign case law, the Court of Appeal further outlined the test to determine if a differentiating law falls foul of Article 12.|$|E

This was in accordance with Black's literalist views.

5|$|The Right to Equality {{is one of}} {{the chief}} {{guarantees}} of the Constitution. It is embodied in Articles 14–16, which collectively encompass the general principles of equality before law and non-discrimination, and Articles 17–18 which collectively encompass further the philosophy of social equality. Article 14 guarantees equality before law as well as equal protection of the law to <b>all</b> <b>persons</b> within the territory of India. This includes the equal subjection of <b>all</b> <b>persons</b> to the authority of law, as well as equal treatment of persons in similar circumstances. The latter permits the State to classify persons for legitimate purposes, provided there is a reasonable basis for the same, meaning that the classification is required to be non-arbitrary, based on a method of intelligible differentiation among those sought to be classified, as well as have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the classification.|$|E

5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} the orders had been made without any notice or hearing, {{and they were not}} given an {{opportunity}} to explain or correct the allegations against them.

As natural justice is an essential aspect of both {{the rule of law and}} the equal treatment by the law of <b>all</b> <b>persons,</b> the appellants argued that the deprivation of their right to a fair hearing was a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which affords to <b>all</b> <b>persons</b> equality before the law and equal protection of the law.|$|E

5|$|Aggrieved {{persons who}} cannot avail {{themselves}} of the protection afforded by Article 12(2) may try to argue {{that they are a}} member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12(1). The rational nexus test, also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification, is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of persons is discriminatory. The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept; it does not require that <b>all</b> <b>persons</b> are treated alike, but rather that <b>all</b> <b>persons</b> in like situations should be treated alike. Consequently, a law that differentiates between classes of persons is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances, and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law. If there is no such relationship, the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace <b>all</b> <b>persons</b> within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E
5|$|Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore {{guarantees}} to <b>all</b> <b>persons</b> equality {{before the law}} and {{equal protection of the}} law.

For example, discrimination on those classifications is prohibited in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the establishing or carrying on of any trade, business, profession, vocation or employment.|$|E
