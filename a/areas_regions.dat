The most common statistical map that is used is called the choropleth map where different shades of a colour are used to highlight contrasts between regions; darker colour means a greater statistical value. This type of map is best used for ratio data but for other data, proportional or graduated symbol maps, such as circles, are preferred. The size of the symbol increases in proportion to the value of the observed object.|$|E

30|$|The {{possible}} {{areas of}} the eye region chosen by Step 1 are defined as the eye <b>region</b> <b>area</b> only when the symmetry of the summation of the gray values in the eye <b>region</b> <b>area</b> is satisfied. For example, the first possible eye <b>region</b> <b>area</b> chosen by Step 1 can be the right eye and the right cheek, as shown in Figure  2 b. Because the first possible eye <b>region</b> <b>area</b> does not satisfy the symmetry of the summation of the gray values in the eye <b>region</b> <b>area</b> characteristic, it cannot be an eye <b>region</b> <b>area.</b> Thus, JEER subsequently chooses the second brightest pixel among the four pixels as the front bone and decides the second possible eye <b>region</b> <b>area.</b> Because the second possible eye <b>region</b> <b>area</b> satisfies the symmetry of the summation of the gray values in the eye <b>region</b> <b>area</b> characteristic, it is chosen as an eye <b>region</b> <b>area.</b> The details are described in Algorithm 2. Therefore, no human face exists in the detection window when all four possible {{areas of the}} eye region do not satisfy the symmetry of the summation of the gray values in the eye <b>region</b> <b>area</b> characteristic, that is, this characteristic is {{a necessary condition for}} the existence of an eye <b>region</b> <b>area</b> in the detection window.|$|R

5000|$|National FFA Organization- The FFA is a {{national}} organization that teaches students leadership skills and {{is designed to help}} members become more well rounded citizens in the agricultural field. [...] The FFA {{is an integral part of}} the program of agricultural education in many high schools as a result of Public Law 740 in 1950 (Currently revised as Publication 105-225 of the 105th Congress of the United States), with 500,823 FFA members (2007-2008). Local chapters participate in Career Development Events (individually and as a team), each student has a Supervised Agricultural Experience program (SAE), and participates in many conferences and conventions to develop leadership, citizenship, patriotism and excellence in agriculture. The National FFA Organization is structured from the local chapter up, including local districts, <b>areas,</b> <b>regions,</b> state associations, and the national level. The FFA Mission is to make a positive difference in the lives of students by developing their potential for premier leadership, personal growth, and career success through agricultural education.|$|E
50|$|Historically, Indian {{country was}} {{considered}} the <b>areas,</b> <b>regions,</b> or territories beyond the frontier of settlement that were inhabited primarily by Native Americans. The first grants of land {{in what is now}} the United States made by the King of England left it to the grantee to make such arrangements as they were able with the Indians living on the granted land. As the original 13 colonies grew and treaties were made, the de facto boundary between settled territory and Indian country during the 18th century was roughly the crest of the Appalachian Mountains, a boundary set into law by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783, and later by the Nonintercourse Act. These areas were defined generally by boundaries set by treaties (or sometimes simply by political circumstances). It was understood that the law of the United States and the laws of individual states were unenforceable in Indian country (for all practical purposes), and tribes that lived on those lands had full sovereignty in those areas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{governors}} of China's provinces and autonomous regions and mayors of its centrally controlled municipalities are {{appointed by the}} central government in Beijing after receiving the nominal consent of the National People's Congress (NPC). The Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions (SARS) have some local autonomy since they have separate governments, legal systems, and basic constitutional laws, but they come under Beijing's control in matters of foreign policy and national security, and their chief executives are handpicked by the central government. Below the provincial level in 2004 there were 50 rural prefectures, 283 prefecture-level cities, 374 county-level cities, 852 county-level districts {{under the jurisdiction of}} nearby cities, and 1,636 counties. There also were 662 cities (including those incorporated into the four centrally controlled municipalities), 808 urban districts, and 43,258 township-level regions. Counties are divided into townships and villages. While most have appointed officials running them, some lower-level jurisdictions have direct popular elections. The organs of self-governing ethnic autonomous <b>areas</b> (<b>regions,</b> prefectures, and counties)—people's congresses and people's governments—exercise the same powers as their provincial-level counterparts but are guided additionally by the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy and require NPC Standing Committee approval for regulations they enact [...] "in the exercise of autonomy" [...] and [...] "in light of the political, economic, and cultural characteristics of the ethnic group or ethnic groups in the areas." ...|$|E
