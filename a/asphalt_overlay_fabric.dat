Numerical value of maximum dynamic stress intensity factor is larger than the corresponding value of the static load.

The increase of <b>asphalt</b> <b>overlay</b> thickness can reduce the value of dynamic stress intensity factor to a certain extent.

40|$|Abstract: For the {{interface}} end formed after paving <b>asphalt</b> <b>overlay</b> on cement concrete pavement, the stress field of interface end {{is very important}} for both structural analysis and interface design when the temperature drops. The stress field of interface end can be gotten with the crack-tip field theory that consider displacement continuation and stress equality on each side of interface, but it needs further verification to prove whether the initial stress field can satisfy far field boundary condition when temperature dropping. In conditions of different material properties, different plane dimension and different thickness of <b>asphalt</b> <b>overlay</b> the stress field is calculated with the finite element method (FEM), and the results show that the forms of theoretical solution can exactly describe stress field of {{the interface}} end when temperature dropping. The stress field of interface end indicates that when the elastic modulus of <b>asphalt</b> <b>overlay</b> becomes lager, the stress singularity’s degree of interface end will reduce. As for the interface end formed after paving <b>asphalt</b> concrete <b>overlay</b> on the concrete pavement, improving the elastic modulus of <b>asphalt</b> <b>overlay</b> is beneficial...|$|R

This project {{presents}} a technical, economic and {{statistical analysis of}} four typical periodic road maintenance activities used in Costa Rica, as defined in Law No. 7798, which were applied for thin <b>asphalt</b> <b>overlays.</b> The first activity consisted in patching before placing a 5 cm <b>asphalt</b> <b>overlay.</b> The second consisted of sealing cracks prior to a 5 cm <b>asphalt</b> <b>overlay,</b> the third consisted of a 5 cm <b>asphalt</b> <b>overlay</b> over the existing pavement {{and the last one}} implied milling 5 cm and placing a 5 cm <b>asphalt</b> <b>overlay</b> Every technique was applied on a homogeneous section located in the Control Section No. 20811 of National Road No. 135, between kilometers 5 + 210 to 6 + 810, chosen because, according to the geo-penetrating radar (GPR), it presented a similar typology type such as thickness of the pavement structure and a consistent state of the pavement surface, according to the Pavement Index Condition (PCI) analysis. The problem was that, in Costa Rica, there is no technical definition for optimizing periodic road maintenance interventions used to improve the structural and functional state of the national routes, which results in a deficiency investment in public works. The technical and economic assessment was to measure the values of evenness or comfort felt by users, defined by IRI indicator, and deflections of the pavement measured by the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD), together with the quality note “Q”, which re{{presents a}} rating {{of the quality of the}} pavement. This work was performed before and after applied the four periodic road maintenance activities, in order to get the benefit assigned to each of them, using the percentage of improvement in road indicators along with the cost assigned to each activity. The statistical evaluation was concentrated on analysis "ANOVA + Tukey" and the test "paired t", with the intention of determining the consistency and validity of the data resulted of the vials indicators. It was evident that placing thin <b>asphalt</b> <b>overlays</b> showed no improvement in the structural conditions (deflection) of the section of research, because the cost-benefit ratios did not exceed 0, 35 for the four activities, where from values of 1, 00 can be considered positive results. However, it was shown that placing thin <b>asphalt</b> <b>overlays</b> did reveal an improvement in the operating conditions (IRI) of the section of research, because the cost-benefit ratios exceeded 1, 25 and for the milling and <b>asphalt</b> <b>overlay</b> it reached 1, 91, which demonstrate that it is the most efficient one in comparison with the other three periodic road maintenance activities. Finally, these findings establish that the milling pavement plus the thin <b>asphalt</b> <b>overlay</b> provide the best option for investment the state funds in periodic road maintenance in public works.

40|$|Pavement {{rehabilitation}} {{is rapidly}} {{becoming one of}} the most important issues facing many highway departments. <b>Asphalt</b> concrete <b>overlay</b> is one of the commonly used methods for rehabilitating deteriorated pavements. One major type of distress influencing the life of an overlay is reflective cracking. Reflective cracking in the overlay allows water to percolate into pavement structure and weaken subbase, and contributes to many forms of pavement deterioration, including increased roughness and spalling. Although these nonwoven fabrics have generally been successful in <b>asphalt</b> <b>overlay</b> applications, there is no synthesis to their performance. In the past, the role of paving fabrics to reduce reflective cracking has not been clearly evaluated. As a result, there is a lack of consistent considerations of paving fabric option in pavement management systems. In this project, applications and effectiveness of stress-relieving interlayers, known as paving fabrics, to reduce reflective cracking is synthesized. Basic functions of paving fabrics, long-term performance, and recent innovations are discussed. In addition, a survey of the current paving fabric applications in the State of Mississippi was conducted to determine the various practices and performances of the paving fabric systems to reduce reflective cracking. The field performance of <b>overlays</b> using <b>fabric</b> interlayers has generally been successful, although there have been cases where the paving fabric systems provided little or no improvements.
