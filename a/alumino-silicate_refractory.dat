The possibility of simultaneous erosion and deposition {{in the same}} cross-section of the channel is shown by chemical reaction model, where the erosion of refractory is described by action of chemically active aluminium oxides and deposition by stable oxides. The variations of erosion and deposition in the same cross-section of the channel are explained by variation of the thickness of laminar sub-layer. A phenomenological model is described to study the stability conditions of a uniform growth of the build-up layer. Based on suitable approximations, analytical formulae have been derived enabling to evaluate the stability region in the concentration-temperature plane depending on the initial roughness of the growing surface...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} causes for failure of {{refractories}} is corrosion by aggressive liquids or vapours. The intensity and, especially, the extent of this chemical attack greatly depend {{on the characteristics of}} the reaction products and the microstructure of the refractory. Any corrosion problem has always two sides to it: (1) the equilibrium state that will be reached sooner or later and (2) how (the mechanism and the rate) is reached. There are several methods, both static and dynamic, to test the corrosion resistance of a refractory material, but none reproduces exactly the actual conditions in a real furnace. They are essencially comparative and a useful tool to assess the mechanism of the corrosion process. In the present work, and {{in order to keep the}} number of variables to a minimum, corrosion static finger tests were carried out with comercial <b>alumino-silicate</b> <b>refractories</b> and molten potassium oxide, using nickel crucibles and a vertical kanthal wound furnace. Test temperatures were 900 and 1000 Â° C and test times up to 24 h. The weight loss and the change in dimensions of the test pieces were related to the physical characteristics and the microstructure of the refractory through X-ray diffraction and chemical and phase equilibrium analysis, and a mechanism is proposed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceICP and XRF Spectroscopy {{methods were}} used to {{evaluate}} the metals (ppm) from soils for the mining dumps of Crucea-Botusana uranium deposit (Bistrita Mountains, Romania). The sequential extraction has emphasized the fact that U is associated with all the mineral fractions present in the soil samples. A great percentage of U {{can be found in the}} carbonate, organic and oxides fractions. The percentage of U detected in the exchangeable fraction is rather small. The fact that 21. 77 % of the total U can be found in the specifically absorbed and carbonate bound fraction, indicated the important role played by the carbonates in the retention of U; one the other hand this fraction is liable to release U if the pH should happen to change. Th appear in high-enough concentration in the soil is scarcely available because 70. 29 % is present in residual fraction, and about 21. 78 % in the organic and oxides fractions. This is certainly due to the fact that this naturally occurring radionuclide can be associated with relatively insoluble mineral phases like <b>alumino-silicates</b> and <b>refractory</b> oxides. Its association with the organic matter suggests that it can form soluble organic complexes that can facilitate its removal by the stream waters...|$|R

Its association with the organic matter suggests that it can form soluble organic complexes that can facilitate its removal by the stream waters. In the case of Sr, the sequential extraction shows that it is very strongly fixed because the residual fraction concentrates the great amount of this element. What is interesting is the percentage of 2. 65 % of Sr from the exchangeable fraction because it can be easily released and transported to the surrounding environment. Pb it is present in various relatively soluble pools (17. 81 % in carbonate boud and 34. 85 % in organically bound), which appears to be an efficient sink for this element. This fact may indicate a possible link between the biological activity and the Pb cycling into the soil. In addition, only 17. 78 % is present in the insoluble residual fraction. Although from our research it resulted that the radioactive metals does not concentrate in the exchangeable fraction (Th) or it concentrates very little in it (U and Sr), the isolation of the mineral fraction of soil rich in U, Th and Sr helps us in the future identification of the connections which control the cycle of the radioactive metals. These results have important implications for remediation strategies. The thorium and uranium from Crucea mining area are in labile, not strongly retained, fractions, thus making them amendable for remediation by phytoremediation...|$|R
