25|$|Nonetheless, {{there is}} some degree of {{empiricism}} <b>and</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems. By establishing a pattern, sometimes {{with the use of}} a powerful computer, mathematicians may have an idea of what to prove, and in some cases even a plan for how to set about doing the proof.

25|$|To use {{a sample}} {{as a guide}} to an entire population, it is {{important}} that it truly represents the overall population. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample <b>and</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> procedures. There are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.|$|E

The DEA was surprised when a number of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and researchers objected to the proposed scheduling and requested a hearing. In a Newsweek article published the next year, a DEA pharmacologist stated that the agency had been unaware of its use among psychiatrists. An initial hearing was held on 1 February 1985 at the DEA offices in Washington, D.C. with administrative law judge Francis L. Young presiding. It was decided there to hold three more hearings that year: Los Angeles on 10 June, Kansas City, Missouri on 10–11 July, and Washington, D.C. on 8–11 October.|$|E

The major recommendations from PES were to have a pilot PES, have effective sample design <b>and</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> of PES, match data between PES and actual enumeration by having correct names of respondents, computerize matching and include cell phone and telephone number of the respondents. The results of the PES indicated that 92.7 per cent of total Zambian residents were captured in the 2010 census, leaving an under count of 7.3 per cent.
