5|$|Gilbertian mimicry {{involves}} {{only two}} species. The potential host (or prey) drives away its parasite (or predator) by mimicking it, {{the reverse of}} host-parasite aggressive mimicry. It was coined by Pasteur as <b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> for such rare mimicry systems, and is named after the American ecologist Lawrence E. Gilbert.|$|E
5|$|Next {{to nothing}} is {{recorded}} of the Germanic languages spoken in the Empire, {{with the exception}} of Gothic. <b>A</b> <b>phrase</b> of Gothic is quoted in an elegiac couplet from the Latin Anthology, and more substantially parts of the Gospels were translated into Gothic and preserved by the 6th-century Codex Argenteus. While Latin gained some Germanic loanwords, most linguistic influence ran the other way.|$|E
5|$|The Epistles {{are widely}} sung and {{recorded}} by amateur choirs and professional singers alike.

5000|$|There are two {{separate}} phrasal heads that relativizers can occupy. Cross-linguistically, relativizers may occupy either {{the head of}} <b>a</b> complementizer <b>phrase</b> (C-Type Relativizer) or the head of <b>a</b> determiner <b>phrase</b> (D-Type Relativizer). C-Type Relativizers can introduce a relative clause as an argument of <b>a</b> noun <b>phrase,</b> or they can introduce a relative clause as an argument of <b>a</b> verb <b>phrase.</b> D-Type Relativizers may only introduce a relative clause as an argument of <b>a</b> noun <b>phrase.</b> English is <b>a</b> language which uses a C-Type Relativizer, that, {{as a part of}} its relativization strategy because [...] "that" [...] can introduce a relative clause as either the argument to <b>a</b> Noun <b>Phrase</b> or the argument to <b>a</b> Complementizer <b>Phrase.</b> The following examples from English shows the same morpheme being used in both syntactic contexts.|$|R
5|$|Gould became {{widely known}} through his popular essays on {{evolution}} in the Natural History magazine. His essays were published in a series entitled This View of Life (<b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> from the concluding paragraph of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species) starting from January 1974 and ended in January 2001, amounting to a continuous publication of 300 essays. Many of his essays were reprinted in collected volumes that became bestselling books such as Ever Since Darwin and The Panda's Thumb, Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, and The Flamingo's Smile.|$|E
5|$|Jellyvision Games did {{not want}} to change much of the older games for the 2011 version. They sought to keep as many of the old game {{question}} types, such as the Jack Attack and Dis Or Dat questions, updating the games to support online play. To counterbalance other types that would not be playable on consoles, such as Gibberish Questions that required players to type in <b>a</b> <b>phrase,</b> the developers added new features to the game, such as the Wrong Answer of the Game. The developers took advantage of other features of the newer consoles: they were able to use rumble features of console controllers to emphasize the effect of Screwing other players, and wrote several humorous titles for the in-game achievements.|$|E
5|$|The Urban District Council {{received}} its {{coat of arms}} from the College of Heralds in 1957. After the change to borough status a modified coat of arms, based on the original, was awarded in 1976, and presented to the council on 24 March 1977. It features a central cross on a shield, representing the town's location at the meeting point of north–south and east–west roads. The shield bears nine martlets representing both the county of Sussex and the new town's original nine neighbourhoods. Supporters, of an eagle and a winged lion, relate to {{the significance of the}} airport to the locality.

50|$|A {{preposition}} {{is usually}} used with <b>a</b> noun <b>phrase</b> as its complement. A preposition together with its complement is called <b>a</b> prepositional <b>phrase.</b> Examples are in England, under the table, after six pleasant weeks, between {{the land and}} the sea. <b>A</b> prepositional <b>phrase</b> {{can be used as a}} complement or post-modifier of a noun in <b>a</b> noun <b>phrase,</b> as in the man in the car, the start of the fight; as a complement of a verb or adjective, as in deal with the problem, proud of oneself; or generally as <b>an</b> adverb <b>phrase</b> (see above).|$|R
5|$|Bellman's poetry {{continued}} to be read and sung throughout the nineteenth century, contrary to the widespread belief among researchers that he was largely forgotten during this period. His songs were sung especially by the urban bourgeoisie and in fraternities, but also in aristocratic circles and ordinary people in the countryside. The , named after <b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> in Epistle 14, was founded in Uppsala in 1853; the song became their trademark. The Epistles and Songs were published in chapbooks, sung at festivals and performed {{in a variety of}} concerts and entertainments. Figures such as Fredman, Ulla Winblad and Movitz, as well as Bellman himself were painted on tavern walls and memorabilia such as plates, beer tankards and hipflasks. Curiously, Bellman was celebrated at least as enthusiastically in polite and abstemious circles, though with bowdlerized versions of the songs.|$|E
5|$|Mozart had a pet common {{starling}} {{which could}} sing {{part of his}} Piano Concerto in G Major (KV. 453). He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing <b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> from a work he wrote six weeks previously, which {{had not yet been}} performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his A Musical Joke (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's vocalisation. Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions. The words have no meaning for the starling, so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they think they have just heard speak.|$|E
5|$|The letter, {{which is}} a {{response}} to Boniface who had requested his support, reveals Ælfwald's sound understanding of Latin. Ælfwald's letter reassures Boniface that his name was being remembered by the East Angles: it contains an offer to exchange the names of their dead, so that mutual prayers could be read for them. According to Richard Hoggett, <b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> in the letter, 'in septenis monasteriorum nostorum sinaxis', has been interpreted incorrectly by historians to imply that there were at the time seven monasteries in Ælfwald's kingdom in which prayers were being read, a theory which has proved difficult for scholars to explain. Hoggett argues that the words in the phrase refer to the number of times that the monks offered praise during the monastic day and not to the number of monasteries then in existence. He points out that this interpretation was published by Haddan and Stubbs as long ago as 1869.|$|E

5|$|Walter Law was {{a friend}} of Andrew Carnegie, who {{described}} Law as always having an interest in reading and writing. When he found <b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> to be clever or intriguing, Law would document it for further use. Carnegie wrote that Law often made new friends, and had an attractive personality. Law's personal interest was largely in his personal library of 7,000 volumes, which he collected for more than forty years. His library was said to contain many works of classic literature and history; on a vacation to Europe, Law mostly spent time in Greece visiting historic sites. He was {{also a member of the}} Alpine Club, Aldine Association, the American Fine Arts Society, Ardsley Casino (now Ardsley Country Club), the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, New York's Century Association, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Players, and Sleepy Hollow Country Club. Law and his wife were on the Aqueduct Guard Citizens' Committee, a committee tasked with providing for the needs of the New York Guard troops who were protecting the Old Croton Aqueduct during World War I. In 1892, Law also received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale University.|$|E
5|$|In about 701 Bede {{wrote his}} first works, the De Arte Metrica and De Schematibus et Tropis; both were {{intended}} {{for use in the}} classroom. He continued to write {{for the rest of his}} life, eventually completing over 60 books, most of which have survived. Not all his output can be easily dated, and Bede may have worked on some texts over a period of many years. His last-surviving work is a letter to Ecgbert of York, a former student, written in 734. A 6th-century Greek and Latin manuscript of Acts of the Apostles that is believed to have been used by Bede survives and is now in the Bodleian Library at University of Oxford; it is known as the Codex Laudianus. Bede may also have worked on one of the Latin bibles that were copied at Jarrow, one of which is now held by the Laurentian Library in Florence. Bede was a teacher as well as a writer; he enjoyed music, and was said to be accomplished as a singer and as a reciter of poetry in the vernacular. It is possible that he suffered a speech impediment, but this depends on <b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> in the introduction to his verse life of Saint Cuthbert. Translations of this phrase differ, and it is uncertain whether Bede intended to say that he was cured of a speech problem, or merely that he was inspired by the saint's works.|$|E
