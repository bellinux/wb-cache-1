60|$|But {{soon the}} sun began to sink over the hill-tops, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> must take her sheep home before night overtook them.|$|E
60|$|Her painful hesitancy brought Frona to a {{realization}} {{of her own}} thoughtlessness. But she had made the step, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> could not retrace it.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I was {{a little}} moose-bird," [...] she whispered, so faint and low he {{scarcely}} heard. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> lied, as she bent {{her head to the}} strap and took the swing of the trail.|$|E
5000|$|The next {{place is}} when Angantyr's brave sister Hervor fights the Huns, although, her small army is greatly outnumbered by the Horde <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> cannot win: ...|$|R
60|$|There, {{where her}} love was--there her safety was. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> it! <b>She</b> {{suddenly}} left me. I asked {{where she was}} going.|$|R
50|$|Buffy {{confesses to}} Spike she cannot love him <b>and</b> that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> is using him {{which leads to}} her ending their {{physical}} relationship.|$|R
60|$|She kept near to him, {{in contact}} with him, but she became ever more and more herself. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> must go to catch her train. But {{she did not want}} to draw away from contact with him.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> {{was in a}} new country, in a new life. It {{was very}} delicious to lie thus still, with one's soul {{wandering}} freely and simply in the silver light of some other, simpler, more finely natural world.|$|E
6000|$|... "She was a {{very active}} person, {{but she was not}} very strong; and when she was nearly forty years old {{something}} happened to her lungs, and her health gave way more and more, until at last there was no hope for her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> must die." ...|$|E
60|$|When Eliza left Uncle Tom's cabin, {{she felt}} very sad <b>and</b> lonely. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> was leaving all the friends {{she had ever}} had behind her.|$|R
3000|$|A. hasn‘t {{changed at}} all, and her views haven’t either, not a bit. (…) <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> what <b>she</b> wants, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> what <b>she’s</b> doing. (Skype Interview with A.’s mother, 2 April 2014) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She's got it across,' Bat whispered. 'I've {{never seen}} her like this. I told her to light up the star, but I was wrong, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> it. <b>She's</b> an artist.' ...|$|R
60|$|She was {{tingling}} {{with delight}} at this freedom, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> was not fit for its responsibility. She just came {{short of a}} passionate refusal of his proposal. He was still so new to her, and things were so wonderful, or I {{think she would have}} made that refusal.|$|E
60|$|Gerald's {{face was}} {{lit up with}} an uncanny smile, full of light and rousedness, yet unconscious. He sat with his arms on the table, his sunbrowned, rather {{sinister}} hands, that were animal and yet very shapely and attractive, pushed forward towards her. And they fascinated her. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>she</b> watched her own fascination.|$|E
60|$|It {{may have}} been that Mrs Lammle tried in some manner to excuse her conduct to herself by depreciating the poor little victim of whom she spoke with acrimonious contempt. It {{may have been}} too that in this she did not quite succeed, for it is very {{difficult}} to resist confidence, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> had Georgiana's.|$|E
6000|$|... "But she is {{not your}} wife, Frank; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>she</b> ought not to be. It is only because you hold her to it that she {{consents}} to be so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{accounts}} for her rejection of Sydney <b>and</b> Ned: <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> is their equal <b>and</b> will not snatch at the rank which is hers by right. No, she's not mercenary or ambitious." ...|$|R
50|$|Kristen {{received}} {{death threats}} from fans {{over the way}} she played Victoria Lane, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> was not popular with Eden and Cruz fans, so Kristen left Santa Barbara in 1989.|$|R
6000|$|Edie {{looked at}} him half {{surprised}} and half puzzled. It was to her such an odd and unexpected point of view. But she felt instinctively that Ernest really and deeply meant what he said, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> must not allude to the subject again. 'I beg your pardon,' she said simply, 'if I've put it wrong; yet you know I can't help feeling the great disparity in our two situations.' ...|$|E
60|$|Jane {{saw that}} an attack {{was going to}} be made upon the party, and hesitated for a moment what to do. The rockets were going up in Mr. Brook's grounds, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> had a few minutes yet. First she ran to the house of James Shepherd. The pitman, who was a sturdy man, had been asleep for the last three hours. She knocked at the door, {{unlocked}} it, and went in.|$|E
60|$|She {{therefore}} gratefully {{refused the}} offer, and Mr. Morris very nearly thanked her for doing so. He took his leave, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> {{must return to}} her post; but first she indulged herself with one brief visit to the room where all her cares and duties had lately centred. A look--a thought--a prayer. The beauteous expression there fixed was a help, as it had ever been in life and she went back again cheered and sustained.|$|E
60|$|Ethel <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> {{had said}} enough. She would miss the man {{if he went}} away, {{but it would be}} better for him <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> would never have more than his liking.|$|R
60|$|Now the Lily {{was in a}} trap, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> it. So <b>she</b> grew bold.|$|R
60|$|Yet all {{the while}} she {{continued}} to picture the office--Bessie's desk, Mr. Wilkins's inkwell, the sinister gray scrub-rag in the wash-room, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> needed some one to lure her mind from the office.|$|R
60|$|They {{were just}} {{approaching}} {{the house where}} lived Mrs. and Miss Bates. She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates loved to be called on, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts.|$|E
6000|$|Dolores {{expected}} her heartless relations {{to insist on}} her leaving off her mourning, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> ought to struggle and shed tears over it; but, to tell the truth, {{she was a good}} deal tired of her hot and fusty black; and when she had followed Mrs. Halfpenny into a passage where the boxes stood uncorded; and the first dress that came to light was a pretty fresh-looking holland that had been sent home just before the accident, she exclaimed-- ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{remained}} {{concentrated in}} the middle of the road. Beyond, one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make him stand out in dark relief. She saw him, slender and firm, as if the setting sun had given him to her. A deep pain took hold of her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> must love him. And she had discovered him, discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness. Quivering as at some [...] "annunciation", she went slowly forward.|$|E
60|$|Paul <b>and</b> <b>she</b> {{were afraid}} of each other. He <b>knew,</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> that <b>she</b> was dying. But they kept up a pretence of cheerfulness. Every morning, when he got up, he went into her room in his pyjamas.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' {{said the}} old woman, 'that I do not, but the Moon will be here presently, and I will ask her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> will <b>know.</b> <b>She</b> can easily see it, for she shines on all things.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was pale}} as a sheet, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> was as bad. They stood staring {{at each other}} in the steamy heat, redolent of the mushy scent of earth, of potted geranium, and of vines coming along fast.|$|R
60|$|Barbara {{let him go}} and followed. He {{looked very}} tired {{and she did not}} want to talk. She saw the {{stretcher}} carried up the hotel steps and along a passage, and then went to her room. A Spanish doctor and nurse were waiting <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> would be sent away. To feel she could not help was hard, but she tried to be resigned and stopped in the quiet room, listening for steps. Somebody might bring a message that Lister wanted her.|$|E
60|$|Clare {{turned her}} head, but {{except for this}} she did not move, {{and it was a}} relief when after a few disjointed remarks his voice died away. She was moved to pity, but for a few moments she had quivered in the grasp of another emotion. It was obvious that Dick did not {{altogether}} know what he was saying, but he had shown her plainly the place she had in his mind, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> would not like to lose it.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the thing}} became {{a dream to}} Genevieve. Maybe she had fainted, she did not know, but for what other reason should Silverstein have {{his arm around her}} {{supporting}} her? All the faces seemed blurred and unreal. Fragments of a discussion came to her ears. The young fellow who had been her guide was saying something about reporters. [...] "You vill get your name in der papers," [...] she could hear Silverstein saying to her, as from a great distance; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> was shaking her head in refusal.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> why <b>she</b> had come. Simply, explicitly, {{she told}} him. He {{shook his head}} slowly.|$|R
60|$|In the car ahead, Jane was {{thinking}} fast <b>and</b> furiously. <b>She</b> {{had felt the}} purpose for which Tarzan had asked a few words with her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> {{must be prepared to}} give him an answer in the very near future.|$|R
6000|$|It was not {{the blood}} but the grating of the {{surgical}} saw on the living bone that broke her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> had been fighting off nausea, that she was beaten. She was lost in dizziness. She heard Kennicott's voice-- ...|$|R
