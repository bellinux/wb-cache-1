40|$|Dose-response {{relationships}} of the cholinergic antagonist, <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate,</b> and the beta-adrenergic agonist, salbutamol, were examined by cumulative dose techniques. A wet aerosol, 1. 5 mg <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate</b> produced a maximum response. The response to 200 microgram of salbutamol from a pressurised aerosol {{was close to}} maximum. Secondly, the bronchodilator response of salbutamol microgram was compared with <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate</b> 2 mg and placebo in 18 asthmatic patients in a randomised crossover study. In 11 of them the bronchodilator response of the combination of salbutamol and <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate</b> was evaluated. <b>Atropine</b> <b>methonitrate</b> produced a similar peak bronchodilator effect to salbutamol, but its effect was more prolonged, the response being significantly greater at four and six hours than with salbutamol. The combination of drugs produced a significantly greater and more lasting bronchodilatation than either of the drugs alone. Despite mild side effects, <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate,</b> either alone or in combination with an adrenergic drug, {{appears to have a}} place in the treatment of sever reversible airway obstruction not adequately controlled by conventional treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{bronchodilator}} potencies of inhaled atropine sulphate and <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate</b> {{have been}} compared either {{alone or in}} combination with fenoterol {{in a group of}} adult asthmatic patients. A cumulative dose response study showed that 2 mg of atropine sulphate produced near maximum bronchodilatation. A larger dose of 4 mg was used in comparing the potency of this drug with 2 mg of <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate,</b> a dose previously shown to produce optimum bronchodilatation. In a randomised double-blind fashion <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate</b> (2 mg), atropine sulphate (4 mg), fenoterol (400 μg), a combination of <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate</b> with fenoterol, a combination of atropine sulphate with fenoterol, and two placebos were administered by inhalation on separate days to eight stable adult asthmatics. Measurements of FEV 1 were made before administration of the drugs and at 20 minutes, one, two, four, and six hours afterwards. The two atropine drugs produced a similar peak effect but the bronchodilatation after <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate</b> was more prolonged. In combination the bronchodilatation achieved with both atropine drugs and fenoterol was greater than with either atropine or fenoterol alone, confirming that atropine and an adrenergic drug can have an additive effect. The response with <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate</b> and fenoterol showed {{a significant increase in the}} FEV 1 for six hours whereas with atropine sulphate and fenoterol the increase of FEV 1 was significantly greater than the placebo for only four hours. It was concluded that the atropine drugs produce useful bronchodilatation either alone or in combination with an adrenergic agent. Of the two atropine drugs, the methonitrate appears to be superior to the sulphate as an inhaled bronchodilator in adult asthmatics...|$|E
40|$|The {{actions of}} the {{following}} pressurized bronchodilators were compared by administration to 24 asthmatics: (1) Medihaler Iso Forte, (2) Alupent, (3) Medihaler-duo, (4) Bronchilator, and (5) Prenomiser Plus. These contained {{one or more of}} the following: isoprenaline, orciprenaline, isoetharine, phenylephrine, <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate,</b> and thenyldiamine. The dose was a single discharge from the container. The response was assessed by calculating the mean percentage change in F. E. V. at intervals after inhalation...|$|E
40|$|Eleven healthy male volunteers {{participated in}} a study {{comparing}} the effects of locally and systemically administered cholinoceptor antagonists on the secretory response of sweat glands to intradermally injected carbachol chloride. Atropine sulphate administered locally into the skin antagonised the response to carbachol: the dose-response curve for carbachol was shifted to the right without any depression of the maximum of the curve. The nicotinic receptor antagonists hexamethonium bromide and (+) -tubocurarine chloride, however, {{had little effect on}} the response to carbachol. Atropine sulphate, administered systemically by intramuscular injection, caused a non-surmountable antagonism of the response to carbachol: the maximum of the dose-response curve was depressed with little change in the value of ED 50. <b>Atropine</b> <b>methonitrate</b> (a mixed muscarinic/nicotinic receptor antagonist), and hexamethonium bromide (a nicotinic receptor antagonist), both with poor access to the central nervous system, were injected intramuscularly: both caused non-surmountable antagonism of the response to carbachol. It is concluded that the response to carbachol is mediated by muscarinic rather than nicotinic receptors. The effect of atropine sulphate on the response to carbachol depends on the route of administration: while locally applied atropine sulphate appears to act as a competitive antagonist, systemically applied atropine sulphate, like <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate</b> and hexamethonium bromide, appears to act in a non-competitive manner. It is suggested that the systemically administered cholinoceptor antagonists reduce the response to carbachol by interacting with cholinoceptors in sympathetic ganglia: such an interaction would reduce the impulse flow in sudomotor fibres resulting in decreased sensitivity of the sweat glands to carbachol...|$|E
40|$|We {{monitored}} sweat secretion (using skin potential) {{and blood}} flow (using skin temperature) in the hind-paw skin of chloralose-anaesthetized cats pre-treated with guanethidine, {{and studied the}} responses to electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral lumbar sympathetic trunk. Stimulation caused sweat secretion {{and an increase in}} skin blood flow which was almost entirely restricted to the paw pads and was completely ipsilateral. Stimulation of the tibial nerve trunk produced similar effects, except that the increase in blood flow was more prolonged. The vasodilator effect of sympathetic trunk stimulation was not affected by chronic deafferentation of the paw. <b>Atropine</b> <b>methonitrate</b> (0. 5 - 1 mg/kg I. V.) abolished the sudomotor response to sympathetic stimulation, but did not attenuate the blood flow response. Hexamethonium (1 - 2 mg/kg I. V.) abolished the vasodilator response to sympathetic stimulation, but did not affect the sudomotor response. Larger doses of hexamethonium (10 - 20 mg/kg) abolished both responses. The data suggest that the lumbar post-ganglionic neurones mediating vasodilatation in the skin of the cat paw pad are distinct from those that mediate sudomotor secretion...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We have {{examined}} the inhibitory effect of atropine and sodium cromoglycate (SCG) on the bronchial response to sulphur dioxide (SO 2) in groups of normal and asthmatic subjects. Eleven normal subjects were premedicated with propranolol (100 mg orally) one hour before each experiment. After baseline measurements of specific airways conductance (sGaw) the subject inhaled an aerosol from a Wright nebuliser for five minutes. In separate experiments this contained water (control), <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate</b> (0 2 %), or SCG (1 %). Fifteen minutes later sGaw was remeasured and the subject then breathed SO 2 (8 ppm) for three minutes through the mouth. Specific airways con-ductance was measured {{for the duration of}} the subsequent response. Intervals between experiments on any one subject were one week or more. After control SO 2 inhalation sGaw decreased in all subjects (mean 34 + 17 (SD) %). Atropine and SCG significantly inhibited the SO 2 response (p < 0 01 for both). After atropine the mean decrease in sGaw was 13 + 24 %; after SCG 16 + 12 % (range- 3 - + 55 %). With atropine the degree of inhibition was inversely related to the subject's responsiveness to the control SO 2 inhalation (r =- 0 75; p < 0 01). In four asthmatics (without beta-blockade and with lower SO 2 exposure) atropine did not inhibit the SO 2 response; SCG had a similar effect to that seen in normal subjects. Therefore, vagal efferent mechanisms are involved in th...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects on}} the airways of {{inhalation}} of the vehicles used in two commercial pressurized bronchodilator aerosols were studied in 20 normal and seven asthmatic subjects. Changes in bronchial calibre due to bronchoconstriction were measured as changes in airway resistance using a constant volume whole body plethysmograph, and results were expressed as changes in the ratio Airway conductance/Thoracic gas volume (=specific airway conductance). The aerosols caused very slight bronchoconstriction in the normal subjects, with a mean decrease of 5 · 3 % in specific airway conductance after inhalation of a spray containing sorbitol trioleate as a surface tension lowering agent, and of 9 · 7 % after inhalation of a spray containing lecithin. This effect was prevented by prior inhalation of <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate,</b> and its mechanism was therefore probably a vagally mediated reflex. The bronchoconstriction was also reversed {{by the addition of}} isoprenaline to the aerosol. The asthmatic subjects showed larger mean reductions in specific airway conductance of 13 % and 21 % after sorbitol and lecithin respectively: the response was again prevented by atropine. We conclude that, although the aerosol vehicles cause slight bronchoconstriction, this is unlikely to be a clinical danger since it is insufficient to cause symptoms of wheezing, and is less than that caused by inhalation of a single cigarette. Moreover, the constriction is regularly converted to dilatation in both normal and asthmatic subjects by the addition of atropine or isoprenaline to the aerosol...|$|E
40|$|The airway {{response}} to the inhalation of ultrasonically nebulised distilled water was determined in 55 asthmatic patients and 16 normal subjects. We calculated the dose of water required to induce a 20 % reduction (PD 20) in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) by measuring {{the output of the}} nebuliser and the volume ventilated by each subject. Forty-eight of the asthmatic patients had a PD 20 of 9 ml or less but three patients required as much as 24 ml. A PD 20 was not recorded in the normal subjects and the challenge was stopped after 33 ml. In 12 patients the challenge was repeated within six months and the airway response was shown to be reproducible at equivalent doses of water. In a separate group of 11 patients there was, however, a highly significant reduction in the percentage fall in FEV 1 when equivalent doses of water were given on two occasions 40 minutes apart. When the temperature of the inhaled water was increased from 22 degrees C to 36 degrees C eight of 10 patients had a similar change in FEV 1 with equivalent doses of water. The airways obstruction induced by the inhalation of water was readily reversed with salbutamol administered by aerosol. In some patients a challenge with water or 3. 6 % saline was repeated after pretreatment with sodium cromoglycate, <b>atropine</b> <b>methonitrate,</b> and verapamil hydrochloride, all given as aerosols. The airway {{response to}} the equivalent dose of water or saline was significantly reduced after treatment with sodium cromoglycate but not atropine or verapamil...|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} the inhibitory effect of atropine and sodium cromoglycate (SCG) on the bronchial response to sulphur dioxide (SO 2) in groups of normal and asthmatic subjects.

After control SO 2 inhalation sGaw decreased in all subjects (mean 34 +/- 17 (SD) %). Atropine and SCG significantly inhibited the SO 2 response (p less than 0. 01 for both). After atropine the mean decrease in sGaw was 13 +/- 24 %; after SCG 16 +/- 12 % (range - 3 - + 55 %). With atropine the degree of inhibition was inversely related to the subject's responsiveness to the control SO 2 inhalation (r = 0. 75; p less than 0. 01). In four asthmatics (without beta-blockade and with lower SO 2 exposure) atropine did not inhibit the SO 2 response; SCG had a similar effect to that seen in normal subjects. Therefore, vagal efferent mechanisms are involved in the bronchial response to SO 2 in normal subjects, but the lack of inhibition caused by atropine in hyperreactive normal and asthmatic subjects suggests that vagal mechanisms are not important in the causation of hyperreactivity to SO 2. The mechanism of inhibition with SCG is unknown...|$|E
