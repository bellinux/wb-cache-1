5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such <b>as</b> <b>myself</b> can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E
25|$|I'd like {{to thank}} {{everybody}} who voted for me and express my gratitude to all my colleagues at Sky Sports. This award is as much for them <b>as</b> <b>myself</b> and reflects our approach to football. My job has also been made easier by the thousands of individuals within the game who've answered my daily requests for information with the attention and care that make this job so enjoyable.|$|E
500|$|The album reached #59 on the Japan Oricon charts. Adam Corn of SoundtrackCentral.com claimed [...] "the {{superior}} instrumental quality, well-done arrangements, and tasteful {{selection of}} themes boost the [...] qualities while hiding its flaws", elaborating that [...] "even people such <b>as</b> <b>myself</b> who are not fans of the original will be impressed by its prowess, and fans will simply be enamored". Neal Chandran of RPGFan was similarly impressed, {{saying that it was}} [...] "a very good soundtrack" [...] and that its tracks sounded [...] "more beautiful than the original version". His primary complaint was that he would have liked for the album to include more pieces.|$|E

500|$|Olivier's acting {{technique}} was minutely crafted, {{and he was}} known for changing his appearance considerably from role to role. By his own admission, he was addicted to extravagant make-up, and unlike Richardson and Gielgud, he excelled at different voices and accents. His own description of his {{technique was}} [...] "working from the outside in"; he said, [...] "I can never act <b>as</b> <b>myself,</b> I {{have to have a}} pillow up my jumper, a false nose or a moustache or wig... I cannot come on looking like me and be someone else." [...] Rattigan described how at rehearsals Olivier [...] "built his performance slowly and with immense application from a mass of tiny details". This attention to detail had its critics: Agate remarked, [...] "When I look at a watch it is to see the time and not to admire the mechanism. I want an actor to tell me Lear's time of day and Olivier doesn't. He bids me watch the wheels go round." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were positive, with Nolan Howell of Canoe.com {{describing}} it as a [...] "straightforward look {{into the life of}} a man that has dedicated himself to the sport of professional wrestling" [...] and has [...] "an endearing, personal style that gives an apt representation of the author...For fans such <b>as</b> <b>myself</b> who appreciated the blunt style of the man known as Hardcore Holly, this ECW Press product will be an entertaining, worthwhile look into one of the unique personalities of professional wrestling." [...] Joe Babinsack, writing for the Wrestling Observer, described the book as [...] "brutal, boisterous and definitely worth reading". Bruce Mitchell, writing for the Pro Wrestling Torch, described the book as [...] "hard-hitting, straightforward, and not very fancy", rating it [...] "one of the strongest professional wrestling books in a long while". Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer wrote, [...] "in a lot of books, you think you're reading what the person writing feels {{is the right thing to}} say for their career... With Holly, whether you agree or not (and I agreed with some of his stuff, not others), I had no doubt he was giving his true opinions on things. In that sense, it was a very honest look at a period of WWF history from a guy who had ups and downs... but survived a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Hearst was {{reluctant}} to play a character similar to herself, commenting, [...] "I'd never gone in and done as cameo <b>as</b> <b>myself</b> or anything, and I wouldn't do that. Yes, the college is called Hearst…which I thought was funny, and it's certainly not related to publishing." [...] Hearst had never previously accepted roles where {{she was asked to}} play herself, stating that it was a [...] "pathetic attempt to get attention" [...] when other celebrities played themselves or characters similar to themselves. Hearst had heard of Veronica Mars and seen several episodes prior to her appearance; nevertheless, she still needed to talk to Thomas about the series and her character before agreeing to guest star, commenting that she discovered that the character's background was not exceedingly similar to her own life, as [...] "Selma's situation is nothing like anything I've had to deal with." [...] When reading the script for the first time, Hearst was amused by the fact that her character was the heiress to the [...] "Hearst Mart fortune", comparing it to Walmart; she stated, [...] "when I read that in the script, I burst out laughing. It was a spit-take kind of thing. I almost fell over." [...] When asked whether or not the character would become a recurring one, she responded that the idea had not come up in discussions with the crew. However, she stated that she would accept if given the opportunity, and she particularly enjoyed working with Kristen Bell, Enrico Colantoni, and Ed Begley, Jr..|$|E

5000|$|In his own words, Ogden has {{described}} how his [...] "position in the analytic world {{has not been}} that of an advocate of a school of psychoanalysis (or as an adversary of 'opposing' schools of psychoanalysis.) Neither do I view <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a 'lone voice', because that suggests that I think of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> a renegade. I would much prefer to describe <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> an independent thinker." ...|$|R

2500|$|Fry has {{repeatedly}} expressed opposition to organised religion, and has {{identified himself as}} an atheist and humanist, while declaring some sympathy for the ancient Greek belief in capricious gods. In his first autobiography he described how he once considered ordination to the Anglican priesthood, but {{came to the conclusion}} that he [...] "couldn't believe in God, because [...] was fundamentally Hellenic in [...] outlook." [...] He has stated that religion can have positive effects: [...] "Sometimes belief means credulity, sometimes an expression of faith and hope which even the most sceptical atheist such <b>as</b> <b>myself</b> cannot but find inspiring." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heidfeld {{picked up}} his first podium since the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix – another race won by Hamilton – and was {{relieved}} to have kept Rosberg behind him, believing that his fellow German was fuelled longer than he actually was. [...] "After the start I thought it {{was not going to}} be a very good race because I knew that Nico was quite long. Actually he came in earlier than expected on the same lap <b>as</b> <b>myself.</b> What we lost at the start we regained on the pit-stop, so our pit-stop crew, just did a fantastic job to just get me out ahead of Nico. Then I was lucky on the pit-stops in terms of the safety car." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burton said, [...] "I've never studied acting or {{anything}} because I've been so lucky with MTV. I'm convinced I {{got the chance}} to be on One Tree Hill because I did a guest thing on Dawson's Creek <b>as</b> <b>myself,</b> when the cast appeared at the MTV Beach House." [...] She added, [...] "And my only scene was with Chad Michael Murray (Lucas Scott). So, now The Chad and I are reunited. How bizarre is that?" [...] With regard to what her life is like as an actress, Burton said, [...] "Actors like to think their lives are very difficult, but they're not. Yeah, you're running around a lot. But I used to work in a supermarket and in a bar. That was hard. This is fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{writes to}} tell the spirit in which he {{received}} my uncle's letter. It is only the Morville temper, again, and, of course, whatever you may think of that on Amy's account, I should never regard it, <b>as</b> concerns <b>myself,</b> <b>as</b> other than his misfortune.

60|$|We had {{the corner}} of a Pullman car to {{ourselves}} that evening as we whirled back to London, and I fancy that the journey was a short one to Colonel Ross as well <b>as</b> to <b>myself,</b> <b>as</b> we listened to our companion's narrative of the events which had occurred at the Dartmoor training-stables upon the Monday night, and the means by which he had unravelled them.|$|R
2500|$|... "Through some slip-up in the {{apparatus}} in Moscow, {{which was supposed}} to be bureaucratically airtight, this document of Trotsky came into the translating room of the Comintern. It fell into the hopper, where they had a dozen or more translators and stenographers with nothing else to do. They picked up Trotsky's document, translated it and distributed it to the heads of the delegations {{and the members of the}} program commission. So, lo and behold, it was laid in my lap, translated into English! Maurice Spector, a delegate from the Canadian Party, and in somewhat the same frame of mind <b>as</b> <b>myself,</b> was also on the program commission and he got a copy. We let the caucus meetings and the Congress sessions go to the devil while we read and studied this document. Then I knew what I had to do and so did he. Our doubts had been resolved... We made a compact there and then — Spector and I — that we would come back home and begin a struggle under the banner of Trotskyism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Melville's {{education}} {{began when}} he was five, around the time the Melvills moved to a newly built house at 33 Bleecker Street. In 1826, {{the same year that}} Melville contracted scarlet fever, Allan Melvill, who sent both Gansevoort and Herman to the New York Male High School, described Melville in a letter to Peter Gansevoort Jr. as [...] "very backwards in speech & somewhat slow in comprehension." [...] His older brother Gansevoort appeared to be the brightest of the children, but soon Melville's development increased its pace. [...] "You will be as much surprised <b>as</b> <b>myself</b> to know," [...] Allan wrote Peter Gansevoort Jr., [...] "that Herman proved the best Speaker in the introductory Department, at the examination of the High School, he has made rapid progress during the 2 last quarters." [...] In 1829, both Gansevoort and Herman were transferred to Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School, and Herman enrolled in the English Department on 28 September. [...] "Herman I think is making more progress than formerly," [...] Allan wrote in May 1830 to Major Melvill, [...] "& without being a bright Scholar, he maintains a respectable standing, & would proceed further, if he could only be induced to study more—being a most amiable & innocent child, I cannot find it in my heart to coerce him." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Clinton's {{tenure as}} Secretary of State was popular {{at the time}} among the public and praised by President Obama, {{observers}} have noted {{that there was no}} signature diplomatic breakthrough during it nor any transformative domination of major issues in the nature of Dean Acheson, George Marshall, or Henry Kissinger. The intractable issues when she entered office, such as Iran, Pakistan, Arab-Israeli relations, and North Korea, were still that way when she left. Many of Clinton's initiatives in the [...] "smart power" [...] realm will take much more time to evaluate as to their effect. Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said that [...] "She's coming away with a stellar reputation that seems to have put her almost above criticism. But you can't say that she's really led on any of the big issues for this administration or made a major mark on high strategy." [...] Michael E. O'Hanlon, a Brookings Institution analyst, said that, [...] "Even an admirer, such <b>as</b> <b>myself,</b> must acknowledge that few big problems were solved on her watch, few victories achieved. [...] more solid than spectacular." [...] Others have been more highly critical of her tenure as Secretary; in a 2015 book entitled , former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, Liz Cheney argue that Clinton's tenure, and the Obama administration's foreign policy generally, weakened U.S. standing in its international relations and deviated sharply from 70 years of well-established, bipartisan U.S. foreign and defense policy that the United States had generally adhered to since World War II. Others, however, such as Eric Schmidt disagree, and have argued that Clinton was [...] "perhaps the most significant secretary of state since" [...] Acheson. All agreed on her celebrity; as one unnamed official said, [...] "She's the first secretary who's also been a global rock star. It's allowed her to raise issues on the global agenda in a way that no one before her has been able to do." ...|$|E
