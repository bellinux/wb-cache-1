40|$|The Winter 2003 issue {{represents}} our {{one year}} anniversary with Biofeedback as an electronic only newsletter. This is another historical milestone {{in one of}} the largest Divisions of SLA. Yes, at the SLA Winter Meeting I learned that we are a large Division and our membership has been on the rise over the past decade with over 700 members during much of that time. We may reach 800 members within the next five years. The SLA Winter Meeting in New Orleans was unexpectedly cold (20 s and 30 s) but ‘warm ’ for <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> from the ‘north’, who were looking at temperatures ranging from 4 degrees to- 20. Our Division was well represented. Nancy Stimson, Lorri Zipperer, and I attended the Leadership Summit programs. Peggy Jones and I attended the last 2003 New Yor...|$|E
40|$|I {{would also}} like to warmly welcome {{everyone}} to this Special Session on the Past, Present and Future of the Nuclear Law Committee. Our Chairperson has already extended a special greeting to <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> special <b>guests,</b> and I would like to echo his words. As you have already heard, the NLC traces its history back to 1957. On January 24 th of that year,...|$|R
60|$|We {{sat down}} to <b>our</b> supper <b>of</b> corn and beans and venison, <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> which <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> ate sparingly. He, too, was a silent man, and {{scarcely}} a word was spoken during the meal. Several times {{he looked at me}} with such a kindly expression in his blue eyes, a trace of a smile around his broad mouth, that I wished he might stay with us always. But once, when my father said something about Indians, the eyes grew hard as flint. It was then I remarked, with a boy's wonder, that despite his dark hair he had yellow eyebrows.|$|R
40|$|Deans; School Directors; Programme Coordinators; {{my fellow}} {{academic}} colleagues and all students. I {{would like to}} acknowledge and welcome the presence <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> from outside <b>our</b> Campus, notably Kgosi Nyalala John Molefe Pilane of the BaKgatla ba Kgafela, the subject of my lecture this evening. I also welcome my colleagues that I serve with on the North-West Provincial Heritage Resources Authority; last, but certainly not least, I extend my hearty welcome to my family and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> my friends who are in the audience. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx...|$|R

We must all bear our share in the uproar, for, trust me, there will be one; {{but there are a}} thousand ways by which our responsibility may be insisted upon. For instance, let us make a list <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests,</b> and then let one of us act as secretary, and sign the invitations, which shall be like tickets. No other name need appear, and the hosts will indicate themselves at the place of rendezvous.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The last remark I {{heard that}} night was a {{compliment}} to Mr. Bixby, uttered in soliloquy and with unction by one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests.</b> He said-- ...|$|R
60|$|September 15th.--I have {{to record}} a {{singularly}} pleasant day; due partly to a return of the fine weather, partly to the good social gifts <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest.</b>|$|R
60|$|AT {{the end of}} {{the fifth}} week <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest's</b> stay, among the letters which the morning's post brought to The Glen Tower there was one for me, from my son George, in the Crimea.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not. It is {{reserved}} {{exclusively for the}} employees. Some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> have private maids, who occasionally use the rear entrances, and Mrs. Tolliver's trained nurses are allowed to pass out that way, too; but----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He never {{allows the}} maid {{to bring in}} the salad," [...] Ethel explained, mirthfully. [...] "He {{considers}} a salad the culmination of his art, and generally announces for the benefit <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests,</b> 'Heap fine salad! Muchey good.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{drive you}} myself {{with my own}} horses," [...] she said, [...] "but you need not be afraid, for I can drive a great deal better than I can row. We must lose no time in seizing <b>all</b> the {{advantages}} <b>of</b> this Amazonian life, for to-morrow some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> will arrive, the Foxes and Mr. Claude Locker." ...|$|R
60|$|We had {{provided}} apples and nuts, doughnuts, cider and other characteristic refreshments {{of the older}} day, but alas! most <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> no longer took coffee at night, and {{only one or two}} had teeth for popcorn or stomach for doughnuts. As a feast our evening was a failure.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose so. The {{settlers}} seemed {{determined to}} make trouble. They have had another row with Gray Man's band, and shots have been fired. Fortunately no one was hurt. We must leave here early. Say nothing to any <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> till we are safely on the way home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! Going already, Mrs. Poyser?" [...] said old Mr. Donnithorne, as {{she came}} to curtsy and take leave; [...] "I thought we should not part with any <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> till eleven. Mrs. Irwine and I, who are elderly people, think of sitting out the dance till then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, that is {{more than}} I can tell you, for he did not mention the family name of his mother; as she was a sister of Lady Dunluce, however, who is the wife of General Ducie, the father <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest,</b> it is {{probable}} her name was Dunluce." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "One day Mrs. Cheston {{gave me a}} luncheon, {{to which}} she invited {{a good many of}} the village ladies; and, after they were all gone, we two sat on the piazza and talked about them. Two or three <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> I had not met before, and in the course <b>of</b> <b>our</b> talk Emily {{mentioned}} the name of Margaret Temple.|$|R

6000|$|It was at {{this party}} that I heard the first word of the {{criticism}} under which I had expected to suffer. One <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests,</b> an old and privileged friend, remarked with a sigh, [...] "Well, now that Zuhl has married a writer, I suppose her own artistic career is at an end." ...|$|R
6000|$|Wallenstein. A salutary counsel----Thou, Octavio! [...] Wilt {{answer for}} the safety <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest.</b> [...] Farewell, Von Questenberg! [...] [QUESTENBERG is about to speak. [...] Nay, not a word. [...] Not one word more of that detested subject! [...] You have {{performed}} your duty--We know how [...] 265 [...] To separate the office from the man.|$|R
60|$|So I {{locked the}} door from the kitchen {{into the house and}} then the outside door of the kitchen, and when my wife came down we hurried off. On the way I told her what I {{intended}} to do, and what I thought <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest.</b> She answered scarcely a word, and I hoped that she was frightened. I think she was.|$|R
60|$|This episode had {{restored}} Mrs. Fordyce, {{and while}} providing some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> with wine, {{and others with}} tea, we heard the story, only interrupted by Martyn's return from a vain search, and Anne's consequent tears, which, however, were somehow hushed and smothered by fears of being sent to bed, coupled with his promises to search {{every step of the}} way to-morrow.|$|R
60|$|The fishy-eyed {{young man}} became one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> regular <b>guests.</b> Dan won his heart by never {{laughing}} at him.|$|R
60|$|As he {{said these}} words, the {{fluorescent}} light brightened for a second, and then faded entirely away. A slightly unpleasant odour also accompanied the departure <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest.</b> In a moment, spectre and scent alike disappeared; but careful examination with a delicate test exhibited a faint reaction which proved {{the presence of}} sulphur in small quantities. The ghost had evidently vanished quite according to established precedent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Right!" [...] {{was their}} cry. [...] "Right on the slayer of Odorik, {{the son of}} Odo, of the lineage <b>of</b> Odin, <b>our</b> <b>guest,</b> and <b>of</b> the King's trust." ...|$|R
60|$|The hours flew on; the {{servants}} brought {{in that light}} banquet whose entrance in the country seems the only method <b>of</b> reminding <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> {{that there is a}} morrow.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you will}} find Mr. Bradley so sceptical {{that you will be}} obliged to defer your going," [...] said Mrs. Bradley, triumphantly. [...] "Come, Louise, we must not forget that we have still Mr. Mainwaring's present comfort to look after; that Minty has basely deserted us, and that we {{ourselves}} must see that the last days <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> beneath <b>our</b> roof are not remembered for their privation." ...|$|R
6000|$|In this unassuming fashion we fed the Hernes, the Severances, {{and other}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> most valued friends who devoured the puddings which Zulime [...] "tossed up," [...] with a gusto highly {{flattering}} to her skill, while {{the sight of}} me as baby-tender proved singularly amusing--to some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests.</b> It will be seen {{that we were not}} cutting entirely loose from the principles of economy in which we had been so carefully schooled--our hospitalities had very distinct (enforced) limits.|$|R
40|$|In {{the latest}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> blogs, London College of Communications student Lydia Polzer, {{who was born}} in the old DDR or East Germany, {{reflects}} on how many people in the former Communist countries are disappointed with the ‘freedoms’ offered by the western liberal news media. This article was also the winner for a UNESCO essay competition which set the question: “The greatest threat to media freedom in the world is…” This is Lydia’s view...|$|R
60|$|We {{all felt}} a shock as she uttered those {{two or three}} French words; her manner was exactly imitated from that <b>of</b> <b>our</b> foreign <b>guest.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Guests on the podcast have {{included}} a number <b>of</b> pilots from <b>all</b> aspects <b>of</b> aviation {{as well as}} analysts, air traffic controllers, adventurers, business owners and museum staff. Some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> notable <b>guests</b> {{have included}}: ...|$|R
5000|$|Usually … Alexei Nikolaevich {{read them}} to me, {{avoiding}} {{the presence of}} visitors. But this time, he was so thrilled with his stories, and so proud of them, {{that he did not}} wait for the departure <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> (a waitress) but came out of his study with the manuscript in his hands and straight into the dining room and, resting his elbows {{on the back of a}} chair, stood reading the story. We both responded enthusiastically." ...|$|R
6000|$|You've {{heard it}} before, and you'll hear it many, many times more. It is an anecdote <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest,</b> <b>of</b> {{the time when}} he was engaged as {{a young man with a}} gentle Hebrew, in the process of {{skinning}} the client. The main part in that business is the collection of the bill for services in skinning the man. [...] "Services" [...] is the term used in that craft for the operation of that kind-diplomatic in its nature.|$|R
6000|$|... "One <b>of</b> <b>our</b> {{permanent}} <b>guests,</b> who {{is suffering}} just now from a severe attack of rheumatism. She employs two trained nurses, a day nurse {{and a night}} nurse." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{had taken}} care of that. I knew how [...] "that that there Fotsky" [...] was the ogre of the riots, and I had guarded against his {{identification}} by speaking <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> as the foreign gentleman who had come home with Mr. Harold, and causing him to be called Count Stanislas; and, on hearing this, Eustace became so urgent in his entreaties, that Harold, though much hurt, relented {{so far as to}} promise at any rate to remain till Monday, so that Dora should not detect the offence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that, by any chance, one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> missing <b>guests,</b> Captain Holderness?" [...] she inquired, turning towards him. [...] "I don't know why, but I have an {{idea that}} it is your sister." ...|$|R
