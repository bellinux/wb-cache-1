5|$|On 11May the briefcase, {{complete}} with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic bag. On receipt the documents were forensically examined, and the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An <b>additional</b> <b>test</b> was made as the papers – still wet {{by the time they}} returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Cadets have a rank {{structure}} {{similar to}} the United States Air Force enlisted and officer grades, excluding those of general officers. A cadet starts as a cadet airman basic, and is promoted {{as he or she}} completes each achievement. Unlike the regular armed forces, where it is possible to enter as either directly as a commissioned following completion of some form of officer training (service academy, college ROTC, or OCS/OTS, etc.), or enlist and eventually advance to non-commissioned officer or petty officer status, a CAP cadet must be promoted through every CAP cadet enlisted grade in order to achieve the rank of CAP cadet second lieutenant. To complete an achievement, a cadet must pass a physical fitness test as well as two written tests, one for leadership and one for aerospace education. The only exceptions to this rule are the promotions to cadet airman and cadet staff sergeant, which have no aerospace test. For some achievements, an <b>additional</b> <b>test</b> of drill proficiency is required. In the new promotion system, effective as of 2010, there is a drill test for all CAP cadet enlisted grades.|$|E
40|$|Background: {{patients}} {{suspected of}} dementia frequently undergo <b>additional</b> diagnostic <b>testing</b> (e. g. brain imaging or neuropsychological assessment) after standard clinical assessment at a memory clinic. This study investigates {{the use of}} <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> in an academic outpatient memory clinic and how it influences the initial diagnosis. Methods: the initial diagnosis after standard clinical assessment (history, laboratory tests, cognitive screening and physical and neurological examination) and the final diagnosis after <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> of 752 memory clinic patients were collected. We specifically registered if, and what type of, <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> was requested. Results: <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> was performed in 518 patients (69 %), 67 % of whom underwent magnetic resonance imaging, 45 % had neuropsychological assessment, 14 % had cerebrospinal fluid analysis and 49 % had (combinations of) other tests. This led to a modification of the initial diagnosis in 17 % of the patients. The frequency of change was highest in patients with an initial non-Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia diagnosis (54 %, compared with 11 and 14 % in patients with AD and ‘no dementia’; P < 0. 01). Finally, after <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> 44 % was diagnosed with AD, 9 % with non-AD dementia and 47 % with ‘no dementia’. Conclusion: <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> should especially be considered in non-AD patients. In the large group of patients with an initial AD or ‘no dementia’ diagnosis, <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> have little diagnostic impact and may perhaps be used with more restraint...|$|R

50|$|In 1992, the United States {{began to}} suspect that SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories and several other medical {{laboratories}} in the United States had adopted a scheme {{that allowed them to}} bill the federal government for unauthorized and unnecessary laboratory tests. The laboratories had “bundled” a standard grouping of blood <b>tests</b> with some <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> and had then marketed this grouping to doctors by leading them to believe that the <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> would not increase costs to Medicare and other government-sponsored health programs. After the ordering of tests, the laboratories “unbundled” the <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> from the standard grouping for purposes of billing. In many cases, treating physicians had made no determination that the <b>additional</b> <b>tests</b> were medically necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of patients;  rather the physicians had preferred to order the tests solely because they were sold as a package with other tests that they had deemed necessary. As a result, the laboratories submitted bills-and received payment-for tests that were medically unnecessary.|$|R

The first 64 S200 SF cars {{will be used}} to expand the Muni fleet to 215 cars; once the fleet reaches 215 cars, Breda cars will be retired as new Siemens cars are accepted. On July 2, 2015, Muni was awarded a grant of $41 million from the California Transportation Agency to eventually pay for 40 of the 64 additional Siemens light rail vehicles. The first car was delivered from the Siemens plant in Sacramento to San Francisco on 13 January 2017; it is expected that deliveries will continue through 2028. In early November 2017, a test car passed a CPUC regulatory inspection with only minor correctable issues and received permission to begin reveue service on November 15.

25|$|During Deatrick's {{tenure at}} the school, {{students}} received the long-awaited Lockheed NF-104Aa rocket-powered variant of the F-104 intended to inexpensively train military space pilots. More than five years before, three F-104s were extensively modified to the NF-104A or Aerospace Trainer (AST) configuration that included {{the addition of a}} rocket engine and a reaction control system for flight in the upper atmosphere where the air is too thin for normal control surfaces to operate. Although the school managed the project, testing was performed not by the school's students, but by experienced test pilots from Lockheed and the Air Force Flight Test Center. Flight testing began in 1963 but was suspended when aircraft 56-0762 was destroyed on 10 December, seriously injuring the pilot. Safety modifications were made to the two remaining aircraft, and a restricted flight profile was defined that lowered the maximum altitude and decreased the climb angle. In spite of the precautions, a serious accident occurred on June 18, 1965 when an instructor flying 56-0756 experienced a hydrogen peroxide fire from the reaction control system. A nitrogen purge system was added, and after <b>additional</b> <b>test</b> flights, the school's students were finally approved for training flights in May 1968.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} Rubik's Cube had no orientation {{markings on}} the centre faces (although some carried the words [...] "Rubik's Cube" [...] on the centre {{square of the}} white face), and therefore solving {{it does not require}} any attention to orienting those faces correctly. However, with marker pens, one could, for example, mark the central squares of an unscrambled Cube with four coloured marks on each edge, each corresponding to the colour of the adjacent face; a cube marked in this way is referred to as a [...] "supercube". Some Cubes have also been produced commercially with markings on all of the squares, such as the Lo Shu magic square or playing card suits. Cubes have also been produced where the nine stickers on a face are used to make a single larger picture, and centre orientation matters on these as well. Thus one can nominally solve a Cube yet have the markings on the centres rotated; it then becomes an <b>additional</b> <b>test</b> to solve the centres as well.|$|E

40|$|Summary: A {{review of}} the {{information}} provided by the supplier may yield evidence of potential photo-enhanced toxicity, especially to aquatic organisms. In this case <b>additional</b> <b>testing,</b> designed to answer concerns about the product may be required. The Project Leader for Fire Chemicals, will send the supplier a letter notifying them of the need for <b>additional</b> <b>testing,</b> the reasons for that testing, and an estimate of the cost and time to perform the tests. The supplier will be asked to either approve the <b>additional</b> <b>testing,</b> at their expense, or the product evaluation will be cancelled. Once supplier approval for <b>additional</b> <b>testing</b> has been received, a sample of the product that was submitted to the Forest Service for qualification testing is then sent to an approved testing lab. Results are sent back to the Forest Service. The Project Leader for Fire Chemicals compiles the results and prepares a letter to the supplier showing the performance of the submitted product.
