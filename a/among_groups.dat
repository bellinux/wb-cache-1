5|$|In {{addition}} to the individual ReMixes, OC ReMix also hosts albums of arrangements and original music. These albums are typically created as collaborations <b>among</b> <b>groups</b> of ReMixers; OC ReMix has released over 70 albums. The majority of these are albums of arrangements, though it also hosts and distributes original soundtrack albums for indie games. These albums are released for free, and are generally created {{by members of the}} ReMix community. Titles include the iOS game Trenches, the Xbox Live Arcade game Return All Robots!, and Missile Master, Episode 1: Invasion.|$|E
5|$|In such studies, and {{in general}} Latter Day Saint parlance, the -suffixed terms Josephite and Brighamite {{have been used for}} the Missouri-based Community of Christ and the Utah-based LDS Church respectively; these terms have {{sometimes}} been used to distinguish groups of denominations as well. Those denominations within each group share a common ancestry and basic beliefs that are different from groups sharing other provenances. The present article, in a similar fashion, distinguishes <b>among</b> <b>groups</b> of denominations by use of commonly understood names such as Mormon fundamentalist or else by short descriptions that often reference a founder of the first church within a factional group–for example, Joseph Smith III in reference to Community of Christ as well as various churches and factions that trace their origin to it.|$|E

In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South by the tens of thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called the Great Migration.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{frequently}} differing ancestry among dark-skinned populations, {{the presence}} of dark skin in general is not a reliable genetic marker, including <b>among</b> <b>groups</b> in Africa.

Mohamoud (2006) likewise observed that their Somali samples were genetically more similar to Arab populations than to other African populations.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possibility}} is that common diseases arise in part through the action of combinations of variants that are individually rare.

However, groups could harbor different, though perhaps overlapping, sets of rare variants, which would reduce contrasts between groups in the incidence of the disease.|$|E

Intradermal testing (IDT) and serology for allergen-specific IgE demonstrated that co-sensitization for all possible pairs {{of the five}} mites was generally 45 % or higher <b>among</b> <b>group</b> A dogs. In the same dogs, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay cross-inhibition results indicated that each one of D. farinae, A. siro and T. putrescentiae was a strong inhibitor of all the remaining mites, whereas D. pteronyssinus was a strong inhibitor of L. destructor. A high number of positive IDT and serology test results for D. pteronyssinus, A. siro, T. putrescentiae and L. destructor were recorded <b>among</b> <b>group</b> B dogs. No conclusive evidence of exposure to these mites was found upon analysis of dust samples from their environment and their food {{for the presence of}} mites and guanine. Also, the number of positive test results was generally higher <b>among</b> <b>group</b> B than <b>among</b> <b>group</b> C dogs. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay cross-inhibition revealed that D. farinae was a strong inhibitor of D. pteronyssinus, A. siro and T. putrescentiae. Collectively, these results demonstrated extensive in vitro cross-reactivity among house dust and/or storage mites that can explain false-positive results upon testing of dust mite-sensitive dogs with atopic dermatitis...|$|R
40|$|Group {{predation}} promotes foraging efficiency {{because it}} increases the size of prey that can be killed and improves hunting success compared to solitary predation. However, group predation may increase competition <b>among</b> <b>group</b> members during feeding. Earlier {{studies have focused on}} the advantages of group predation, but {{little is known about the}} costs and benefits of group predation for individual members of the group. Here, we show that the costs and benefits of group predation for individuals of the predatory stink bug Andrallus spinidens vary with prey size in laboratory experiments. We found that when A. spinidens fed on small prey, group predation did not significantly increase foraging efficiency but did increase competition for food <b>among</b> <b>group</b> members. In contrast, when prey was large, group predation promoted foraging efficiency, and competition over food was not detected. Our results suggest that group predation by A. spinidens nymphs is advantageous for individual members because it enables each member to hunt larger prey that could not be hunted alone. However, when group size was large or prey size was small, group predation increased competition <b>among</b> <b>group</b> members...|$|R
