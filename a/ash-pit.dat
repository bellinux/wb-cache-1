60|$|And the {{man went}} on. Mrs. Dakin, going up her yard, spied Mrs. Morel taking the ashes to the <b>ash-pit.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{keep your}} frocks clean, children! You must walk on your hind legs. Keep {{away from the}} dirty <b>ash-pit,</b> and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the pig-stye and the Puddle-Ducks." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nqong called Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--always hungry, dusty in the sunshine, {{and showed}} him Kangaroo. Nqong said, [...] "Dingo! Wake up, Dingo! Do you see that gentleman dancing on an <b>ash-pit?</b> He wants to be popular and very truly run after. Dingo, make him so!" ...|$|E
60|$|The houses {{themselves}} were substantial and very decent. One could walk all round, seeing little front gardens with auriculas and saxifrage {{in the shadow}} of the bottom block, sweet-williams and pinks in the sunny top block; seeing neat front windows, little porches, little privet hedges, and dormer windows for the attics. But that was outside; that was the view on to the uninhabited parlours of all the colliers' wives. The dwelling-room, the kitchen, was at the back of the house, facing inward between the blocks, looking at a scrubby back garden, and then at the <b>ash-pits.</b> And between the rows, between the long lines of <b>ash-pits,</b> went the alley, where the children played and the women gossiped and the men smoked. So, the actual conditions of living in the Bottoms, that was so well built and that looked so nice, were quite unsavoury because people must live in the kitchen, and the kitchens opened on to that nasty alley of <b>ash-pits.</b>|$|R
50|$|At the Upper Terrace {{found the}} {{evidence}} of early historic includes the deposit fire places with <b>ash-pits,</b> rammed floor, consisting of roads, dumping area of waste products and smelting activity area. Iron and copper alloy implements, beads of semi-precious stones and glass. Pottery (russet coated ware, red polished ware and rouletted ware). The lead and copper coins were recovered from the floor levels, of the Maharathis and Satavahanas period.|$|R
60|$|Just {{outside of}} this, {{on a little}} hill, was Tom Brangwen's big, red-brick house. It looked from the front upon {{the edge of the}} place, a {{meaningless}} squalor of <b>ash-pits</b> and closets and irregular rows of the backs of houses, each with its small activity made sordid by barren cohesion {{with the rest of the}} small activities. Farther off was the great colliery that went night and day. And all around was the country, green with two winding streams, ragged with gorse, and heath, the darker woods in the distance.|$|R
60|$|It was in {{the early}} Throttle-Ha'penny days that Mrs. Houghton died. James Houghton cried, and put a black band on his Sunday silk hat. But he was too feverishly busy at Throttle-Ha'penny, selling his hundredweights of <b>ash-pit</b> fodder, as the natives called it, to realize {{anything}} else.|$|E
6000|$|... "A smoke!" [...] gasped Grenfell. [...] "With {{your mouth}} and tongue like an <b>ash-pit!</b> I'd much sooner have a sherry cobbler, {{as they used to}} make it with a big lump of ice {{swimming}} in it, at the--it's the club, I mean. That is," [...] he added, with a sigh, [...] "if I could get it." ...|$|E
6000|$|When she got downstairs, {{she would}} find the house tidy, but dirty. She could not rest until she had {{thoroughly}} cleaned; so she {{went down to the}} <b>ash-pit</b> with her dustpan. Mrs. Kirk, spying her, would contrive {{to have to go to}} her own coal-place at that minute. Then, across the wooden fence, she would call: ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{large part}} of the village, {{including}} Farmfield House, was lost {{in the construction of the}} Uskmouth power station and the adjoining huge <b>ash-pits</b> in 1959. Although the main part of the village centres around the church in West Nash, much of the village is set along the wide Broadstreet Common, accessed via Pye Corner or Straits Lane, and which provides the more direct route to Whitson and Redwick. For many years the German family were the village blacksmiths at Pye Corner with the premises eventually becoming a petrol station. The site is now occupied by the offices of the Caldicot and Wentloog Levels Internal Drainage Board. About 400 m south of Pye Corner is Fair Orchard, dating from the early 19th century, which is a Grade II listed building. The village had its own small infant school, built in 1877 [...] on West Nash Road, It closed in the 1970s and has now been converted into a private dwelling.|$|R
60|$|We {{came near}} to the ugly rows of houses that back up against the pit-hill. Everywhere is black and sooty: the houses are back to back, having only one entrance, which is from a square garden where black-speckled weeds grow sulkily, and which looks on to a row of evil little <b>ash-pit</b> huts. The road {{everywhere}} is trodden over with a crust of soot and coal-dust and cinders.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She SHALL {{not look}} so much finer than us,' they cried passionately {{to each other}} {{as soon as they were}} alone; and when night came they stole out of their rooms, and taking out the wedding-dress, they laid it in the <b>ash-pit,</b> and heaped ashes upon it. But Habogi, who knew a little magic, and had guessed what they would do, changed the ashes into roses, and cast a spell over the sisters, so that they could not leave the spot for a whole day, and every one who passed by mocked at them.|$|E
60|$|Yes. She {{was back}} home! Nothing had changed. She {{had never been}} away. California? Had she seen it? Had she for one minute left this {{scraping}} sound of the small shovel in the <b>ash-pit</b> of the furnace? But Kennicott preposterously supposed that she had. Never had she been quite so far from going away as now when he believed she had just come back. She felt oozing through the walls the spirit of small houses and righteous people. At that instant she knew that in running away she had merely hidden her doubts behind the officious stir of travel.|$|E
6000|$|A {{locomotive}} is, next to {{a marine}} engine, the most sensitive thing man ever made; and No. [...] .007, besides being sensitive, was new. The red paint was hardly dry on his spotless bumper-bar, his headlight shone like a fireman's helmet, and his cab {{might have been a}} hard-wood-finish parlour. They had run him into the round-house after his trial--he had said good-bye to his best friend in the shops, the overhead travelling-crane--the big world was just outside; and the other locos were taking stock of him. He looked at the semicircle of bold, unwinking headlights, heard the low purr and mutter of the steam mounting in the gauges--scornful hisses of contempt as a slack valve lifted a little--and would have given a month's oil for leave to crawl through his own driving-wheels into the brick <b>ash-pit</b> beneath him. [...] .007 was an eight-wheeled [...] "American" [...] loco, slightly different from others of his type, and as he stood he was worth ten thousand dollars on the Company's books. But if you had bought him at his own valuation, after half an hour's waiting in the darkish, echoing round-house, you would have saved exactly nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars and ninety-eight cents.|$|E
60|$|There in a stuffy {{court in}} London, a grimy oblong box of a room, during the {{exceptional}} {{heat of the}} May of 1956, the leading counsel of the day argued and shouted over a miserable little matter of more royalties or less and whether the Dass-Tata company might not bar the Holsten-Roberts' methods of utilising the new power. The Dass-Tata people were indeed making a strenuous attempt to secure a world monopoly in atomic engineering. The judge, after the manner of those times, sat raised above the court, wearing a preposterous gown and a foolish huge wig, the counsel also wore dirty-looking little wigs and queer black gowns over their usual costume, wigs and gowns that were held to be necessary to their pleading, and upon unclean wooden benches stirred and whispered artful-looking solicitors, busily scribbling reporters, {{the parties to the}} case, expert witnesses, interested people, and a jostling confusion of subpoenaed persons, briefless young barristers (forming a style on the most esteemed and truculent examples) and casual eccentric spectators who preferred this pit of iniquity to the free sunlight outside. Every one was damply hot, the examining King's Counsel wiped the perspiration from his huge, clean-shaven upper lip; and into this atmosphere of grasping contention and human exhalations the daylight filtered through a window that was manifestly dirty. The jury sat in a double pew {{to the left of the}} judge, looking as uncomfortable as frogs that have fallen into an <b>ash-pit,</b> and in the witness-box lied the would-be omnivorous Dass, under cross-examination....|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{negotiating}} we have had, {{and shall}} have," [...] exclaims Smelfungus, my sad foregoer,--"fit rather to be omitted from a serious History, which intends {{to be read}} by human creatures! Bargaining, Promising, Non-performing. False in general as dicers' oaths; false on this side and on that, from beginning to end. Intercepted Letters from Fleury; Letter dropping from Valori's waistcoat-pocket, upon which Friedrich claps his foot: alas, alas, {{we are in the}} middle of a whole world of that. Friedrich knows that the French are false to him; he by no means intends to be romantically true to them, and that also they know. What is the use to human creatures of recording all that melancholy stuff? If sovereign persons want their diplomacies NOT to be swept into the <b>ash-pit,</b> there are two conditions, especially one which is peremptory: FIRST, that they should not be lies;--SECOND, that they should be of some importance, some wisdom; which with known lies is not a possible condition. To unravel cobwebs, and register laboriously and date and sort in the sorrow of your soul the oaths of crowned dicers,--what use is it to gods or men? Having well dressed and sliced your cucumber, the next clear human duty is: Throw it out of window. In that foul Lapland-witch world, of seething Diplomacies and monstrous wigged mendacities, horribly wicked and despicably unwise, I find nothing notable, memorable even in a small degree, except this aspect of a young King who does know what he means in it. Clear as a star, sharp as cutting steel (very dangerous to hydrogen balloons), he stands in the middle of it, and means to extort his own from it by such methods as there are.|$|E
