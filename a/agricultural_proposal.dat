25|$|The Cancún ministerial {{collapsed}} {{for several}} reasons. First, differences over the Singapore issues seemed incapable of resolution. The EU had retreated on few of its demands, but several developing countries refused any consideration {{of these issues}} at all. Second, it was questioned whether some countries had come to Cancún with a serious intention to negotiate. In the view of some observers, a few countries showed no flexibility in their positions and only repeated their demands rather than talk about trade-offs. Third, the wide difference between developing and developed countries across virtually all topics was a major obstacle. The US–EU <b>agricultural</b> <b>proposal</b> {{and that of the}} G20 developing nations, for example, show strikingly different approaches to special and differential treatment. Fourth, there was some criticism of procedure. Some claimed the agenda was too complicated. Also, Cancún ministerial chairman, Mexico’s Foreign Minister Luis Ernesto Derbez, was faulted for ending the meeting when he did, instead of trying to move the talks into areas where some progress could have been made.|$|E

40|$|The {{mid-term review}} of the WTO Doha Round of trade {{negotiations}} held recently in Cancun was concluded in a premature fashion by the hosts. Participants were not moving forward towards a process that would see the talks move towards a final agreement in 2004. This was a disappointment for New Zealand because we rely strongly on the WTO multilateral framework to further liberalise world trade. This is especially so in agricultural products where {{it was hoped that}} after the modest beginnings of the Uruguay Round, signed in 1994, progress could be made more quickly. The stop/start negotiations of the Uruguay Round were not dissimilar. Cancun stumbled on the Singapore issues, and before <b>agricultural</b> <b>proposals</b> had been dealt with. This fortuitous situation provides an important opening for New Zealand agriculture but a great deal of work will need to be done. The other positive feature coming out of Cancun is that the slippage in timing is likely to be great (see below), so New Zealand has the time even with its modest resources, to influence the direction of the agricultural talks.

40|$|In this study, we {{outline the}} farm policy {{changes in the}} European Union, EU, and the United States, US, since 1996 and compare their levels of support under various policies. The {{producer}} support estimates for the EU are {{more than twice that}} of the US, although the value of EU agricultural production is only 30 % more than the US production value. In the EU, reductions in the intervention (support) prices for cereals, oilseeds and beef sector have been compensated by increased direct payments, i. e., payments based on historical acreage and yield or animal head counts. In 1996, the US eliminated target prices and deficiency payments for major crops, and acreage set-sides for supply control. They have been replaced with fixed and emergency payments. However price floors (loan rate with deficiency payments) have been retained for major crops. The sugar and dairy sector policies of the EU and the US have undergone few changes since 1996 [...] The initial EU and US <b>agricultural</b> <b>proposals</b> for the Doha round focused on reducing market access barriers and export subsidies, but refrained from limiting domestic support measures. Developing countries' effective opposition to these proposals led to the collapse of the 2003 WTO Ministerial Meeting at Cancun, Mexico. The recently announced Doha Work Program proposes complete elimination of export subsidies and significant reductions in market access barriers. In the case of domestic support, developing countries' views such as the reductions in product and non-product specific de minimis provisions, and the criteria for blue box payments are reflected in the proposal. At the same time, developed countries' views on the continued placement of direct payments in either blue or green box have been included in the proposal. However, agreement on the extent of reductions and the specific modalities is expected in the next 16 months. The final agreement, scheduled for presentation to members at the Hong Kong WTO Ministerial Conference in December 2005, likely depends on whether or not the new proposals and their modalities would result in meaningful limits on domestic support.

40|$|Agricultural {{productivity}} and growth in Mali are under threat from erratic rainfall, resulting in more frequent dry years. The national economy {{is vulnerable to}} climate change due to 50 % {{of the gross domestic}} product coming from the agricultural sector and 75 % of the population living in rural areas. The Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) concept arises from a need to provide innovative solutions towards the complex and integrated goals of increasing yields, improving resilience, and promoting a low emissions agricultural sector. A major challenge for policymakers to operationalize CSA is the identification, valuation (cost-benefit), and subsequent prioritization of climate-smart options and portfolios (groups of CSA options) for investment. This paper presents the process, results, and lessons learned from a yearlong pilot of the Climate-Smart Agriculture Prioritization Framework (CSA-PF) in Mali. Key national and international stakeholders participated in the co-development and prioritization of two CSA portfolios and related action plans for the Malian Sudanese zone.

40|$|The European Union {{increasingly}} integrates climate objectives {{into other}} policy areas. However, minimizing {{greenhouse gas emissions}} is not necessarily compatible with environmental protection or sustainable development, as the examples of nuclear energy, hydropower and biofuels illustrate. Therefore, climate policy integration needs to be compatible with the overarching objective of sustainable development. This article discusses under which conditions legislation that integrates climate objectives contributes to sustainable development and how this can be evaluated at the policy proposal stage. The key contribution is to illustrate in the European context how legislation on climate policy integration can be designed to also contribute to sustainable development. Based on the European Sustainable Development Strategy, this paper proposes four criteria: policy integration and coherence, environmental protection, social and economic development and justice/participation.

Agriculture was persistently viewed by the Sudanese state as the most viable area for intervention through the implementation of rural agricultural development programs to thereby solve the revenue, national integration and hence legitimization crises at once. However, in the context of the Nuba mountains this proved problematic due to the irreconcilable conflict of interests among the diverse ethnic groups that principally stemmed from the British colonial legacy. This, in turn, promoted the continual failure of rural agricultural development policies. The failure of development has been manifested in the rise and fall of the Nuba Mountains 2 ̆ 7 ethno-political organizations during the last four decades agitating the persistent state of ethno-regional development imbalance. ^ This thesis traces these events with attention to the permanent and changing ethnic composition of the Nuba mountains, the numerous successive agricultural development schemes, and the social-political organizations which both respond to and structure these events.

As he took the position, the government of Pennsylvania was skeptical of the institution and disinclined to grant it appropriations, in spite of the school's status as the state's only land-grant university. To improve the institution's image, Atherton supported a public relations campaign designed to accurately project the school's purpose. He argued that the college should become a school of technology, in keeping with the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, as opposed to being dominated by agricultural and classical studies.

40|$|The {{agricultural}} {{sector of the}} United States economy has long been recognized for its productive capacity and relative efficiency. This has resulted in abundant, high-quality, and relatively low-cost food and fiber. Many factors have made contributions to this phenomenon: adequate natural resources, research and resulting technology, the ready availability of this technology to farmers, available capital and labor, and the entrepreneurial ability of the American farmer to combine these resources efficiently. One type of research and technology that has made a major contribution to the productive capacity and efficiency is that which relates to agricultural chemicals — pesticides for the control of insects, weeds, and diseases. The positive contribution of agricultural chemicals is generally accepted and can be validated. However, there is an expressed concern regarding the possible consequences of improper use of agricultural chemicals that might result in danger to the user, crops, livestock, aquatic and wildlife, and to the ultimate consumer of food products.

40|$|Among the {{different}} production factors, land {{is the one}} that most often limits farm development {{and one of the most}} studied.

They combine insights and data from a farm household investment model revised and extended in order to simulate the demand curve for land in different policy scenarios and a survey of farmers stated intention carried out in the province of Bologna (Italy) in 2012. Based on these results, the authors calibrate a mathematical programming model of land market exchanges for the province of Bologna and use this model form simulation. The results of the model largely corroborate the results from the survey and both hint at a relevant reaction of the land demand and supply to the shift from the historical to the regionalised payments.

40|$|The US {{proposals}} for the WTO agricultural negotiations were tabled on July 25 th 2002. While the 'Cairns Group broadly supported the proposal, others questioned their {{credibility in the}} light of the US Farm Bill. The US proposals address export competition, market access and domestic support. On export competition the proposals called for elimination of export subsidies over five years. On market access it proposes an across-the-board cut in agricultural tariffs leading to a maximum of 25 % within five years followed by moves to completely eliminate tariffs on <b>agricultural</b> products.

40|$|On the one hand, the big {{selling points}} of {{floating}} exchange rates - monetary independence and accommodation of {{terms of trade}} shocks - have not lived up to their promise. On the other hand, proposals for credible institutional monetary commitments to nominal anchors have each run aground on their own peculiar shoals. Rigid pegs to the dollar are dangerous when the dollar appreciates. Money targeting doesn't work {{when there is a}} velocity shock. CPI targeting is not viable when there is a large import price shock. And the gold standard fails when there are large fluctuations in the world gold market. This paper advances a new proposal called PEP: Peg the Export Price.

A series of simulations shows how such a proposal would have worked for oil producers over the period 1970 - 2000. The paths of real oil prices, exports, and debt are simulated under alternative regimes. An illustrative finding is that countries that suffered a declining world market in oil or other export commodities in the late 1990 s, would under the PEP proposal have automatically experienced a depreciation and a boost to exports when it was most needed. The argument for PEP is that it simultaneously delivers automatic accommodation to terms of trade shocks, as floating exchange rates are supposed to do, while retaining the credibility-enhancing advantages of a nominal anchor, as dollar pegs are supposed to do. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to draw {{attention}} to calculations on the environmental effects of agriculture and to the definition of marginal agricultural yield. When calculating the environmental impacts of agricultural activities, the real environmental load generated by agriculture is not revealed properly through ecological footprint indicators, as the type of agricultural farming (thus the nature of the pollution it creates) is not incorporated in the calculation. It is commonly known that extensive farming uses relatively small amounts of labor and capital. It produces a lower yield per unit of land and thus requires more land than intensive farming practices to produce similar yields, so it has a larger crop and grazing footprint. However, intensive farms, to achieve higher yields, apply fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides, etc., and cultivation and harvesting are often mechanized. In this study, the focus is on highlighting the differences in the environmental impacts of extensive and intensive farming practices through a statistical analysis of the factors determining agricultural yield. A marginal function is constructed for the relation between chemical fertilizer use and yield per unit fertilizer input. Furthermore, a proposal is presented for how calculation of the yield factor could possibly be improved. The yield factor used in the calculation of biocapacity is not the marginal yield for a given area, but is calculated from the real and actual yields, and this way biocapacity and the ecological footprint for cropland are equivalent. Calculations for cropland biocapacity do not show the area needed for sustainable production, but rather the actual land area used for <b>agricultural</b> production. The <b>proposal</b> the authors present is a modification of the yield factor and also the changed biocapacity is calculated. The results of statistical analyses reveal the need for a clarification of the methodology for calculating marginal yield, which could clearly contribute to assessing the real environmental impacts of agriculture...|$|R
40|$|The 2007 – 08 {{international}} food price crisis caused hardship on {{a number}} of fronts. The steep rise in food prices led to economic difficulties for the poor and generated political turmoil in many countries. The crisis could also result in long-term, irreversible nutritional damage, especially among children. There is a global interest in preventing such events from recurring. The price crisis was triggered by a complex set of long-term and short-term factors, including policy failures and market overreactions. One important factor in the crisis was the entry of significant financial resources into futures markets, including food commodity markets, which contributed to a price spike during {{the first six months of}} 2008. This episode highlights the need to modify the architecture of international financial and agricultural markets to address the problem of price spikes, especially their effects on the livelihoods of the poor. Although a set of guiding principles for regulating agricultural and commodity futures markets should be developed and recent inappropriate trade policy instruments such as export bans should be reviewed, these actions are not sufficient to avoid extreme price spikes and to ensure that the world can respond to emergency needs for food. We propose two global collective actions to meet these goals. First, a small physical food reserve should be established to facilitate a smooth response to food emergencies. Second, an innovative virtual reserve should be set up to help prevent market price spikes and to keep prices closer to levels suggested by long-run market fundamentals like supply and demand. This brief offers some specifics on implementing a proposal described in our earlier IFPRI policy brief titled Physical and Virtual Global Food Reserves to Protect the Poor and Prevent Market Failure (June 2008). Price instability is a general feature of <b>agricultural</b> markets. The <b>proposals</b> made here are designed not to stabilize prices generally, but to prevent damaging price spikes. The proposed actions will entail costs, but the modest costs of the required organizational elements must be balanced against the benefits of more effective international financial architecture. These benefits will include prevention of economic hardship, improved market efficiency, stronger incentives for long-term investment in agriculture, and prevention of political instability.

40|$|Agricultural {{and food}} supply systems are inefficient as {{evidenced}} by poor utilization of phosphorous (P), large losses of energy and sizeable and distributed losses of food (Wirsenius 2003; Cordell et al. 2011). Researchers have identified {{the need for a}} restructuring of the <b>agricultural</b> system, however, <b>proposals</b> for the optimal system are highly dependent on specialized interests, such as food security, nutrient efficiency or energy production (Wirsenius 2003; Schmid Neset et al. 2008; Jansa et al. 2010; Cordell et al. 2012). Regarding systemic changes, the disconnect between researchers addressing their compartmentalized issues could result in problem shifting. For example, a system optimized for energy production could accelerate nutrient depletion and/or increase nutrient pollution. In terms of evaluating solutions for secondary biomass utilization, the Norwegian Ministry of Environment has stated energy production as the priority (Milj&# 248;direktoratet 2013). Renewable energy sources are needed but the lack of concurrent consideration of issues like nutrient depletion is a strong concern. Norway has existing access to renewable energy in the form of hydropower, but lacks any domestic supply of P, which is a limited resource. There has yet to be published a Material Flow Analysis (MFA) that incorporates multiple layers to evaluate the energy and nutrient perspectives in an agricultural system. This report used MFA to evaluate the Norwegian agricultural system in terms of dry matter, energy and phosphorous. The goal of this modeling was to identify synergies and overlaps between the ideal systems for P and energy optimization. This report aimed to improve the theoretical foundation upon which initiatives and policies are built, {{in order to ensure that}} the most advantageous leverage points are used for maximum efficiency. A baseline model was constructed with the three aforementioned layers. The agricultural system was modelled from domestic production through to post consumer waste collection. Following from this baseline, three scenarios were tested and the impacts on the P and energy system compared. Important indicators in the P layer proved to be fertilizer imported, the P incinerated, the P accumulation in soils. In the energy layer focus was placed on process energy use and energy production, as well as examining large sources of loss from the system. The results indicate that Norway is not very food secure and is highly reliant on imports of phosphorous fertilizer for the food that is grown domestically. The Norwegian government must recognize the relative impacts that the agriculture and food system have on the energy and P cycles respectively. The system modeled in this report controls nearly 100 % of the P cycling within the country along with aquaculture and fisheries, yet could provide a maximum of around 11 % of the nation&# 146;s electricity. In a country with access to hydropower, energy production should not be prioritized over phosphorous reduction, reuse and recovery. Manure is not accepted by farmers as a source of P and is also a poor source of energy. Harvest residues, in contrast, appear to be a good source of both P and energy, without the same problems of transportation and spatial distribution. This novel and innovative multi-layered modeling successfully shed light on the inter-relations between phosphorous and energy in the Norwegian agricultural systems and contributed important preliminary results. </p...|$|R
