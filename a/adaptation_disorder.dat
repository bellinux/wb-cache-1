Esta investigación pretende realizar un estudio de caso a un niño de escolar que presenta un trastorno de adaptación. Se sigue una metodología cualitativa con la aplicación de técnicas y la posterior elaboración del informe psicológico delimitando la conducta a seguir y recomendaciones concretas orientadas a los diversos agentes socializadores que conforman la SSD del escolar. Se encontró que las esferas más afectadas fueron la escolar y la familiar al mismo tiempo que constituyen contextos resilientes; el niño presenta un TA de tipo ansioso con síntomas como intranquilidad, trastornos del sueño, poca concentración de la atención, agresividad con sus iguales, conductas regresivas, etc. La conducta a seguir en este caso orienta previamente la atenuación de la sintomatología ansiosa para realizar la psicoterapia favorablemente, y {{a su vez}} ofrece recomendaciones concretas a las áreas familiar y escolar. (DUAZARY 2011 No. 2, 213 - 225) Abstract Child Psychopathology {{examines the}} infant in the health-disease process, and recognizes {{the need for a}} correct holistic and contextualized psycho diagnostic that considers the individual social situation of development (SSD), and that gets dynamics, as the content and form of the disorder symptoms adaptation (DSA), one of the most prevalent in children and adolescents. This research intends to conduct a case study to a school child who has an <b>adaptation</b> <b>disorder.</b> It is based on a qualitative methodology with the application of techniques and the further elaboration of the psychological report defining the approach to be followed and specific recommendations aimed at the various socializing agents that make up the school's SSD. It was found that the most affected areas were school and family, at they same time they are considered resilient contexts, the child has an <b>adaptation</b> <b>disorder</b> with symptoms of anxiety such as restlessness, sleep disturbances, poor concentration of the attention, aggression with other kids, regressive conduct, etc. The approach to be followed in this case previously directs the attenuation of symptoms of anxiety as to get a positive psychotherapy, and in turn offers specific recommendations to family and school areas.

40|$|Etiology of {{psoriasis}} {{is still}} not known and comprises a range of assumptions and very complex etiological and pathogenetic mechanisms. Along with genetical predisposition, mental disorders and stresses might have {{a key role in}} the occurrence of this disease. Total number of 70 patients suffering from psoriasis were included in the investigation. Generally accepted structured clinical interview (SCID – The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV) was applied in diagnostics of mental disorders. Various mental disorders were found in as many as 90 % of patients suffering from psoriasis. The most frequent mental disorders were depressive disorder (19. 2 %), the posttraumatic stress disorder (17. 8 %), alcoholism (16. 4 %), <b>adaptation</b> <b>disorder</b> (15. 1 %), anxiety – depressive disorders (13. 7 %) and generalized anxious disorder (9. 6 %). The authors have concluded that in patients with psoriasis both various mental disorders and various stress events are frequent.

40|$|Background: Mental {{disorders}} may interfere, aggravate or mimic medical conditions. Aim: To {{study the}} prevalence of psychiatric disorders among patients hospitalized in a medical ward of a general hospital. Patients and methods: A structured interview for DSM-III, devised for "non patients", was applied to 203 men and 203 women, aged 11 to 90 years old, hospitalized in an internal medicine service of a public hospital. Thirty four psychiatric conditions that can be discriminated with the instrument and others that complied with DSM-III criteria, were investigated. Results: There was a 60 % prevalence of mental disorders among men (alcohol dependency in 26 %, delirium or dementia in 10. 8 %, anxiety disorders in 10. 4 %, major depression in 7. 8 % and <b>adaptation</b> <b>disorders</b> in 3 %).

The study was conducted among middle school pupils on the identified different types of disorders, and they related to {{the perception of the}} dominant parenting styles in the family of origin. The classification of parenting styles developed by Maria Ryś was adopted, who distinguished the following styles: democratic, autocratic, liberal loving and liberal unloving. The identification of the types of disorders was made based on the Teacher’s Report Form (TRF) created by Thomas M. Achenbach. The analysis of dependencies between the types and dimensions (syndromes) of <b>adaptation</b> <b>disorders</b> and parenting styles in the family of origin revealed that the attitude of parenting attitudes to a small extent determine the differences in the types of <b>adaptation</b> <b>disorders,</b> but specific trends are visible, which indicate a link between certain dimensions of parenting styles preferred by the mother and father: (1) internalizing disorders are significantly associated with the father’s parenting attitudes (autocratic and liberal loving attitude), causing the strengthening of problems in interpersonal functioning (social issues); (2) mixed disorders are associated significantly with the mother’s parenting attitudes (democratic, autocratic, liberal loving and unloving attitude), triggering disorders of withdrawal, anxiety-depressive and maladjusted behaviour; externalizing disorders are associated with parenting attitudes of both parents (democratic and liberal loving attitude), triggering mainly somatic complaints and anxiety-depressive disorders...|$|R

When the symptoms of pain and physical problems do not respond to various therapeutic approaches such as medication, physiotherapy, and psychotherapy, they are often called medically unexplained symptoms. As such, these symptoms are reported to be a response to stressful situations or emotional states, often unknown to patients themselves. To explore the effectiveness of noninvasive radioelectric brain stimulation in the amelioration of symptoms of pain and physical problems, we administered a neuropsychophysical optimization protocol using a REAC device. Methods: The PSM, a self-administered questionnaire, was used to measure psychological stress and pain and physical problems in a group of 888 subjects. Data were collected immediately prior to and following a 4 -week REAC treatment cycle. Results: There was a significant reduction in scores measuring subjective perceptions of stress for subjects treated with one cycle of neuropsychophysical optimization REAC-BS.

Deficiencies in interpersonal and social relationships increase individuals 2 ̆ 7 risk for becoming chronically lonely. The more pathological consequences of loneliness are to be found among those adults who develop personality and <b>adaptation</b> <b>disorders,</b> such as alcohol abuse, loss of self-esteem, extreme forms of anxiety, powerlessness, and stress (de Jong Gierveld, 1998). Based on the idea that chronic feelings of loneliness may have roots in early childhood experiences, a mediational model of parental alcoholism effects on loneliness among adult children of alcoholics (ACOAs) using Attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969) as the theoretical framework was proposed, tested, and validated in the current study. The model hypothesized that parental drinking would impact family environment, which, in turn, would influence the development of parental attachment security. This was hypothesized to influence emotional expressivity, social support, and loneliness. Emotional expressivity was also hypothesized to partially mediate the effects of parental attachment on social provisions; this, in turn, was hypothesized to mediate the effects of emotional expressivity and partially mediate the effects of parental attachment on loneliness; differences in experiences of loneliness were hypothesized to have implications for life satisfaction. Participants (N = 422) completed retrospective reports of parental alcoholism, family environment, and parental attachment, and current reports of emotional expressivity, social support, loneliness, and life satisfaction.

40|$|The aim was {{to study}} {{dynamics}} of changes of certain biochemical indices {{and the development of}} adaptation in white rats with active and passive type of behavior under the influence of immobilization stress. Experiments were conducted on white rats, previously divided into groups of active and passive ones, on the basis of indicators of activity in the test “open field”. Modeling of immobilization stress was carried out by placing the animals in plastic boxes for 6 hours daily within 30 days. It was found that the immobilization caused changes of carbohydrate, lipid, calcium metabolism, activity of alkaline phosphatase, alanine- and aspartataminotransferase in blood serum of both experimental groups. However, the intensity, direction of the biochemical parameters, development in time depends on the type of animal behavior. To a greater degree active animals reacted to immobilization by changing of concentration of glucose and calcium in the blood on the 3 rd and 5 th day of the experiment, changes of all investigated parameters were observed on the 10 th and 30 th day of the experiment. Animals with active type of behavior appeared to be more susceptible to stress mobilization, but the intensity of their metabolic processes was higher than in animals with a passive type of behavior. This is testified by the highest level of blood glucose and lower levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as more active processes of calcium metabolism in the active animals than passive ones. Thus, dynamics of changes of biochemical parameters and the proceeding of the adaptation process in the conditions of immobilization stress depends on individually-typological features of animal behavior. This indicates to the necessity of differentiated approach to correction of <b>adaptation</b> <b>disorders</b> due to the action of immobilization stress on the organism with different typology of behavior...|$|R

40|$|Different protein {{secondary}} structure elements have different physicochemical properties and {{roles in the}} protein, which may determine their evolutionary flexibility. However, {{it is not clear}} to what extent protein structure affects the way Darwinian selection acts at the amino acid level. Using phylogeny-based likelihood tests for positive selection, we have examined the relationship between protein {{secondary structure}} and selection across six species of Drosophila. We find that amino acids that form disordered regions, such as random coils, {{are far more likely to}} be under positive selection than expected from their proportion in the proteins, and residues in helices and beta-structures are subject to less positive selection than predicted. In addition, it appears that sites undergoing positive selection are more likely than expected to occur close to one another in the protein sequence. Finally, on a genome-wide scale, we have determined that positively selected sites are found more frequently toward the gene ends. Our results demonstrate that protein structures with a greater degree of organization and strong hydrophobicity, represented here as helices and beta-structures, are less tolerant to molecular <b>adaptation</b> than <b>disordered,</b> hydrophilic regions, across a diverse set of proteins...|$|R
40|$|First online: 23 January 2015 In this article, {{we propose}} the {{hypothesis}} that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) acquired neotenic development as a consequence of mesocortical dopamine (DA) innervation, which in turn drove evolution of the PFC into becoming a complex functional system. Accordingly, from the evolutionary perspective, decreased DA signaling in the PFC associated with such adverse conditions as chronic stress may be considered as an environmental <b>adaptation</b> strategy. Psychiatric <b>disorders</b> such as schizophrenia and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder may also be understood as environmental adaptation or a by-product of such a process that has emerged through evolution in humans.

Objective. To {{study the}} {{correlation}} between adolescents’ psychical disorders and their difficulties of psychosocial adaptation. Methods and materials. There were 63 adolescent participants in our study (47 girls and 16 boys) who were hospitalized in Department of Children and Adolescent Psychiatry, Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital (Lithuania) {{during the period from}} September to December, 2005. Twenty-seven adolescents (19 girls and 8 boys) had suicidal and self-harming behavior. Psychical disorders were diagnosed according to ICD- 10 diagnostic criterions. We used Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire SDQ-lit adapted for Lithuania. Results. While comparing the mean scores in both sexes of adolescents with diagnoses of depressive, behavioral and adaptation disturbances, we found a statistically significant difference only in emotionally disturbance scale results (P= 0. 016). Analyzing groups of girls and boys separately, girls showed to be worse psychosocially adapted and had more emotional problems. Girls who tried to commit suicide had more emotional (P= 0. 006) and psychosocial problems (P< 0. 001). Girls who were diagnosed with affective disorders had more expressed emotional (P< 0. 001) and general adaptation (P= 0. 031) difficulties. Parents noted that those who committed a suicide and had behavior disturbances had more expressed emotional (P= 0. 007) and general adaptation (P= 0. 053) problems. Conclusions. 1. Adolescent girls who were diagnosed depressive illnesses had more emotional and general adaptation problems than girls who were diagnosed behavior or <b>adaptation</b> <b>disorders.</b> 2. Adolescent girls who tried to commit suicide had more expressed behavior problems and difficulties of emotional, general adaptation. 3. Most expressed difficulties of emotional and general adaptation were typical to girls who were diagnosed with depression and who tried to commit a suicide...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Nowadays, {{the problem}} of students’ {{adaptation}} to the educational process proves to be urgent, cardiovascular diseases ranking first among <b>adaptation</b> <b>disorders.</b> Early development of arterial hypertension (AH) is of peculiar concern. However, the mechanisms of adaptation to the educational process {{as well as the}} causes accounting for the development of AH in young people have not been studied sufficiently so far. The objective is to find out the peculiarities of cardiac intervalography and psychological state of virtually healthy young males and females at different risk of AH development. Materials and methods. 150 boys and 173 girls aged 16 to 21 years, all of them were students of the medical university, were examined. Measurement of the arterial pressure (AP) in the lying position was followed by the calculation of the mean hemodynamic pressure. The level above 90 mmHg pointed at high risk of AH development, whereas 90 mmHg and lower suggested its insignificant probability. Cardiac activity of autonomous regulation was estimated at the starting point and on the sixth minute of the postural test according to R. M. Baevsky method. The “BHC-Микро” device (Russia) was used. Psychological characteristics were studied by FPI questionnaire (form B). Parametric methods of statistical analysis were used. The sampling contingent was formed by means of stratified randomization. Results. It was found that in the lying position the activity of the sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) prevailed in boys and girls at high risk of AH development compared to those with the lower one. Adequate regulatory mechanisms were activated in orthostasis, specifically, the tone of the ANS sympathetic part increased. Students at low risk of AH development revealed enhanced intensity of regulatory mechanisms due to activation of both ANS parts. This appears to be adequate for the given group and indicates larger adaptation reserves, since all values are comparable with those in the group of students at high risk of AH development. The tone of the ANS parasympathetic part was found to increase significantly in the female students at low risk of AH development. Meanwhile, reduced tone of the ANS sympathetic part was evident in the girls at high risk of AH development. If compared to the boys, more intensive starting activity of the ANS sympathetic part at low risk of AH development alongside with the reduced activity at high risk of AH development was noted in the girls in orthostasis. So, the sex difference of ANS tone persisting at low risk of AH development was found to be vanishing at the growing risk of the disease. The latter may be attributed to the aggravated stress state in the given group of youths as well as activated adrenal cortex, thus contributing to the increased risk of AH development. FPI testing of the psychological state found no more than sex difference between the groups at different risk of AH development. Conclusions. 1. In the lying position, cardiac intervalographic findings revealed prevailing activity of the ANS sympathetic part in boys and girls at high risk of AH development. 2. In orthostasis, larger adaptation reserves were noted in the students at low risk of AH development compared to those at high risk. 3. At high risk of AH development, the sex difference in the autonomous support of the cardiac rhythm was found to be vanishing alongside with the growing activity of the sympathetic part, which predisposes AH development. 4. FPI testing of the psychological state found no difference between the groups at different risk of AH development...|$|R
40|$|Sepiapterin reductase (SR) catalyses {{the last}} step in the tetrahydrobiopterin {{biosynthesis}} pathway; it converts 6 -pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin (6 -PTP) to BH(4) in an NADPH-dependent reaction. SR deficiency is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder with normal phenylalanine (Phe) concentration in blood and diagnostic abnormalities are detected in CSF. We present a 16 -month-old girl with SR deficiency. From the newborn period she presented with an <b>adaptation</b> regulatory <b>disorder.</b> At the age of 3 months, abnormal eye movements with dystonic signs and at 4. 5 months psychomotor retardation were noticed. Since that time axial hypotonia with limb spasticity (or rather delayed reflex development), gastro-oesophageal reflux and fatigue {{at the end of}} the day has been observed. Brain MRI was normal; EEG was without epileptiform discharges. Analysis of biogenic amine metabolites in CSF at the age of 16 months showed very low HVA and 5 -HIAA concentrations. Analysis of CSF pterins revealed strongly elevated dihydrobiopterin (BH(2)), slightly elevated neopterin and elevated sepiapterin levels. Plasma and CSF amino acids concentrations were normal. A phenylalanine loading test showed increased Phe after 1 h, 2 h and 4 h and very high Phe/Tyr ratios. SR deficiency was confirmed in fibroblasts and a novel homozygous g. 1330 C>G (p. N 127 K) SPR mutation was identified. On L: -dopa and then additionally 5 -hydroxytryptophan, the girl showed slow but remarkable progress in motor and intellectual ability. Now, at the age of 3 years, she is able to sit; expressive speech is delayed (to 1 1 / 2 years), passive speech is well developed.

40|$|During {{the last}} fifty years, {{intensive}} husbandry has profoundly modified the animal living conditions, especially in pigs and poultry. At the same time, concerns about animal welfare were growing on. "Welfare " (" le bien-etre " in french) {{can be defined as}} a state of dynamic balance (homeostasy) between the animal and its environment (internal and external). The attempts of the animal to maintain or to adjust this balance may induce physical and mental sufferings, eventually harmful even on a health than on a performance point of view. Welfare of farm animals is assessed using 4 complementary and closely linked types of measures, i. e. performance, health, physiology and ethology. Ethological measurements involve a lot of advantages and are more and more utilised: study of <b>adaptation</b> abilities, behavioural <b>disorders</b> or animal motivation and preference. Ethology is thus considered as a very useful tool that can not be neglected, as shown by the important scientific work, notably in pigs and poultry. Research results have to constitute an essential prerequisite to the ethical reflection process regarding animal welfare, allowing to induce concrete and relevant political acts. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Objective: Our aim was to study the effect of levocarnitine on dynamics of the brain bioelectrical activity formation in term infants delivered by cesarean section. Methods. The study included term infants (gestation period 38 – 40 weeks) delivered by cesarean section, with perinatal hypoxic lesion of the central nervous system (cerebral ischemia). Children were randomized into groups of standard (recommended) treatment and standard treatment enhanced with levocarnitine (plus levocarnitine) — 30 % oral solution at a dose of 100 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks starting from the 7 th day of life. The brain bioelectrical activity was assessed with electroencephalography (EEG) of the natural sleep period on the 3 rd– 6 th day and then at 3, 6, and 12 months. Results. 45 children were randomized into groups of standard treatment and standard treatment plus levocarnitine, of which 44 and 40 children completed the study, respectively. Initially, the delayed formation of age-related {{brain activity}} was detected in 16 / 40 (40 %) children receiving levocarnitine and in 19 / 44 (43 %) in the experimental group (p = 0. 767), disturbances in the EEG sleep pattern with generation of background anomalies — in 17 (43 %) and 16 (36 %) (p = 0. 565), pathological graph elements — in 1 (3 %) and 2 (5 %) children (p = 0. 536), respectively. According to the dynamic EEG control results, it was found that after 1 year the cerebral dysfunction was registered less frequently in children receiving levocarnitine — in 32 (80 %) vs. 42 (96 %) children in the group of standard treatment (p = 0. 028). Conclusion. Adminisration of levocarnitine in the neonatal period reduces the risk of developing cerebral dysfunction {{by the end of the}} first year of life.  </p...|$|R
