25|$|The {{most widely}} {{reported}} <b>and,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> effective gas of the First World War was mustard gas. It was a vesicant that {{was introduced by}} Germany in July 1917 prior to the Third Battle of Ypres. The Germans marked their shells yellow for mustard gas and green for chlorine and phosgene; hence they called the new gas Yellow Cross. It was known to the British as HS (Hun Stuff), while the French called it Yperite (named after Ypres).|$|E
25|$|In 1074, John revolted against King George II of Georgia, and {{attempted}} to get Seljuk support. However, a Seljuk invasion force temporarily occupied the duchy and captured the ducal family. David IV, a new <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> successful king of Georgia, forced the Baghvashi into submission in 1093, and checked their subsequent attempts to revolt. In 1103, he {{took advantage of the}} death of the last Kldekarian duke Rati III and abolished the duchy incorporating the area directly into a royal domain.|$|E

25|$|When President Gates {{resigned}} in 1912, Fisk trustees began a national search to select his replacement. Although some Fisk alumni and the Nashville Banner, the city's Black newspaper, {{argued that a}} Black man should replace Gates, Booker T. Washington, a Fisk trustee <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important voice in the presidential search process, counseled the timing was not right for a Black Fisk president. Instead, the trustees, in consultation with Dr. Wallace Buttrick, Executive Officer of the General Education Board, turned to Thomas Jesse Jones.|$|E
25|$|In {{the lion}} cut, the hindquarters, muzzle, and {{the base of}} the tail are shaved {{and the rest of the}} body is left full length. This cut {{originated}} with the fishing dogs of Portugal. This is the traditional cut <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> functional, given the breed's history as a fisherman's companion. The lion cut diminished the initial shock of cold water when jumping from boats, as well as providing warmth to the vitals. The hindquarters were left shaved to allow easier movement of the back legs and the powerful, rudder-like tail.|$|E
25|$|Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the Koppal district, {{built in}} 1112, {{is an example}} of Dravida {{articulation}} with a nagara superstructure, dedicated to Shiva and is among the larger temples built by the Western Chalukyas <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> famous. Inscriptions hail it as the 'Emperor among temples'. Here, the main temple, the sanctum of which has a linga, is surrounded by thirteen minor shrines, each with its own linga. The temple has two other shrines, dedicated to Murthinarayana and Chandraleshwari, parents of Mahadeva, the Chalukya commanders who consecrated the temple in 1112.|$|E

25|$|Reverend Robert Shields (May 17, 1918 October 15, 2007) was {{a former}} Minister and high school English teacher who lived in Dayton, Washington, United States, and left behind a diary of 37.5 million words that fills 94 boxes. The diary chronicles every five minutes of his life from 1972 until a stroke {{disabled}} him in 1997. Shields's diary was longer than those kept by the journalist Edward Robb Ellis (21 million words), the poet Arthur Crew Inman (17 million words), <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> famous diarist of all, Samuel Pepys (1.25 million words).|$|E
25|$|The F Ring is the {{outermost}} discrete ring of Saturn <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> active {{ring in the}} Solar System, with features changing on a timescale of hours. It is located 3,000km beyond {{the outer edge of}} the A Ring. The ring was discovered in 1979 by the Pioneer 11 imaging team. It is very thin, just a few hundred km in radial extent. While the traditional view has been that it is held together by two shepherd moons, Prometheus and Pandora, which orbit inside and outside it, recent studies indicate that only Prometheus contributes to the confinement. Numerical simulations suggest the ring was formed when Prometheus and Pandora collided with each other and were partially disrupted.|$|E
25|$|Traditional stories {{handed down}} by the ancient Romans {{themselves}} explain the earliest history of their city in terms of legend and myth. The most familiar of these myths, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> famous of all Roman myths, {{is the story of}} Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf. They decided to build a city, but after an argument, Romulus killed his brother and the city took his name. According to the Roman annalists, this happened on 21 April 753 BC. This legend had to be reconciled with a dual tradition, set earlier in time, that had the Trojan refugee Aeneas escape to Italy and found the line of Romans through his son Iulus, the namesake of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.|$|E

25|$|By 1860, {{when the}} first rumblings of secession began to be heard across the South, antebellum Nashville was a prosperous city. The city's {{significance}} as a shipping port made it a desirable prize {{as a means of}} controlling important river and railroad transportation routes. In February 1862, Nashville became the first state capital to fall to Union troops. The state was occupied by Union troops {{for the duration of the}} war. The Battle of Nashville (December 15–16, 1864) was a significant Union victory <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> decisive tactical victory gained by either side in the war; it was also the war's final major military action, which afterward became almost entirely a war of attrition consisting largely of guerrilla raids and small skirmishes, with the Confederate forces in the Deep South almost constantly in retreat.|$|E
25|$|Many {{worked with}} a mix of folk and rock forms, {{including}} Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, David Bromberg, David Grisman, Kinky Friedman, Jorma Kaukonen, Leonard Cohen, Simon and Garfunkel; more purely on the rock side are David Lee Roth, Lenny Kravitz, pop bands such as Army of Lovers and all three Beastie Boys. Many American rock and metal bands have at least one Jewish musician, notably both leading members of KISS (Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley), Geddy Lee of Rush, Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer, Grateful Dead percussionist Mickey Hart, Bon Jovi (keyboardist David Bryan), the Doors guitarist Robby Krieger, Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian, Ramones' Joey Ramone and Tommy Ramone, and Guns N' Roses drummer Steven Adler, and Disturbed frontman David Draiman; a few prominent UK examples are Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> notably the late Marc Bolan of T. Rex, added to all that many Jewish musicians have been and are part of the progressive rock/metal movement including: King Crimson bassist Tony Levin (also from Peter Gabriel's band), Rod Morgenstein (drummer for the Dixie Dregs), Jordan Rudess (Dream Theater keyboardist), Mike Portnoy (drummer for Dream Theater and Transatlantic). Today, some Jews have begun to experiment with forms such as reggae and rap, and artists such as Matisyahu have used forms of secular culture to express religious ideas.|$|E

500|$|Ralph Budd and the Burlington {{capitalized}} on the Zephyrs success. However, most passenger trains needed larger capacity.

However, Burlington {{was determined to be}} the leader, and ordered its large [...] "E" [...] series passenger diesels to also be equipped with matching stainless-steel fluting. Many of the Burlington's long distance named passenger trains began operating under the Zephyr banner, including the Nebraska Zephyr, Twin Cities Zephyr, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> famous of the namesake, the California Zephyr.|$|E
