5|$|In The King of Fighters XIII, Iori's {{gameplay}} mechanics were {{modified to}} {{be a close}} range fighter. Despite losing his flaming techniques, he was given brutal moves using his nails to emphasize his character's ferociousness. His strongest technique in the game, , is a new move that focuses on violent combos {{and serves as a}} reference to the character's ending from The King of Fighters '96 in which he brutally murders his teammates. Iori's 10th color scheme in the game matches his classic outfit's scheme, and during development of the game, details were added to increase the similarities. The ending of the character {{at the end of the}} game was also pointed by developers <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> look forward to. His version, featuring his classic techniques, was designed with the intention of not surpassing the current Iori so that players would choose the fighting style they prefer in the game. This was further emphasized in the console version of The King of Fighters XIII where Iori had his moveset adjusted for better balancing by not using flaming techniques.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{entered the}} 1990s {{with the release}} of the soundtrack, I'm Breathless (1990), which {{contained}} songs inspired by the film Dick Tracy. She also released her first greatest hits compilation, The Immaculate Collection, in the same year. The album has sold more than 30million copies, becoming the best-selling compilation album by a solo artist. It also became the second best-selling album by a female artist in the United Kingdom and her second certified diamond album in the United States. In 1991, she signed a $60million recording contract and business deal with Warner Bros. and Time Warner. As part of this, she founded Maverick Records, which became her main record company, with Sire and Warner Bros. as distributors of her music. Her next releases under Maverick were the studio albums, Erotica (1992) and Bedtime Stories (1994), as well <b>as</b> <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> Remember (1995), a collection of Madonna ballads. All of them reached multi-platinum status in the US and achieved commercial success. Her third soundtrack album, from the musical Evita, was released in 1996. The double-disc endeavor was certified five times platinum by the RIAA, recognizing 2.5million shipments throughout the United States. Madonna's seventh studio album, Ray of Light, was released in 1998 and has sold more than 16million copies worldwide.|$|E

In other words, virtue is something that is both internal and external in the sense that one can practice internal good dispositions and also the expression of these good dispositions.|$|E

25|$|At present, {{the islanders}} are about evenly split between those favouring {{independence}} {{and those who}} prefer to continue {{as a part of}} the Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an immediate unilateral declaration of independence. Others see it <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be attained gradually and with the full consent of the Danish government and the Danish nation. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.|$|E
25|$|Non-possessiveness: Many polyamorists view {{excessive}} {{restrictions on}} other deep relationships {{as less than}} desirable, as such restrictions {{can be used to}} replace trust with a framework of ownership and control. It is usually preferred or encouraged that a polyamorist strive to view their partners' other significant others (often referred to as OSOs) in terms of the gain to their partners' lives rather than a threat to their own (see compersion). Therefore, jealousy and possessiveness are generally viewed not so much <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> avoid or structure the relationships around, but as responses that should be explored, understood, and resolved within each individual, with compersion as a goal.|$|E

25|$|The Alternative Service Book 1980 (ASB) was {{the first}} {{complete}} prayer book produced by the Church of England since 1662. Its name derives {{from the fact that}} it was proposed not as a replacement for the Book of Common Prayer (BCP) but merely as an alternative to it. In practice, it was so popular that the various printers had to produce several editions very quickly and churches which retained the BCP drew attention to this fact <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be noted. The Prayer Book Society was soon complaining that it was becoming hard to find a church which used the old prayer book and that theological colleges were not introducing students to it. It has now been replaced by Common Worship.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{recognition}} of Islam as the state religion in the constitution, when created it was explicitly noted that the status was merely a symbolic one. It was not seen <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{be used as a}} basis of law, except by some Malay nationalists. Currently a dispute exists between those who promote a secular interpretation of the federal constitution and those who believe Shariah courts and Islamic law should have supremacy. The movement towards a more Islamic society, known as dakwah, is often viewed as an effort to resist western influences. Secular values are often favoured by the Malay elite, who welcome the shared goals of industrial development. It is however opposed by Muslims who see it as an invasion of western culture and worldview.. Support for a more Islamic society often comes from the more rural population of Malays.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in almost}} all cases we are {{involved}} in the world in an ordinary, and more involved, way. We are usually doing things with a view to achieving something. Take for example, a hammer: it is ready-to-hand; we use it without theorizing. In fact, if we were to look at it as present-at-hand, we might easily make a mistake. Only when it breaks or something goes wrong might we see the hammer as present-at-hand, just lying there. Even then however, it may be not fully present-at-hand, as it is now showing itself <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be repaired or disposed, and therefore a part of the totality of our involvements. In this case its Being may be seen as unreadiness-to-hand. Heidegger outlines three manners of unreadiness-to-hand: Conspicuous (damaged; e.g., a lamp's wiring has broken), Obtrusive (a part is missing which is required for the entity to function; e.g., we find the bulb is missing), Obstinate (when the entity is a hindrance to us in pursuing a project; e.g., the lamp blocks my view of the computer screen).|$|E

500|$|Hurt: The EP is {{the first}} EP by British singer-songwriter Leona Lewis. It was {{released}} on 9 December 2011 by Syco Music and RCA Records. The EP served <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> bridge the gap for her fans whilst she finished recording her third studio album Glassheart (2012). The album {{was supposed to be}} released in November 2011, but was delayed to March 2012, and again to November 2012. Lewis's reason for delaying the album was because after she met producer Fraser T Smith, the singer wanted to collaborate on new material for possible inclusion on Glassheart. As a result, Smith also produced Hurt: The EP. The EP consists of three cover versions: [...] "Hurt" [...] by Nine Inch Nails; [...] "Iris" [...] by the Goo Goo Dolls and [...] "Colorblind" [...] by Counting Crows. Musically, the songs are influenced by rock music, whilst the lyrics revolve around feeling pain.|$|E
500|$|After {{three years}} of touring for Something to Write Home About, the band was {{beginning}} to feel burned-out, and wished to depart from the upbeat power-pop sound with which they had become associated. They also wanted to find a new producer to challenge them creatively, approaching Nigel Godrich and Gil Norton with offers, although both declined. Finally, the band settled on Scott Litt, best known for his work with R.E.M. and Nirvana. The band's third studio album, On a Wire was released on May 14, 2002, debuting a more measured, alternative style. Just <b>as</b> <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> Write Home About alienated some fans with its more produced sound, On a Wire was criticized by fans who were disappointed with the album's softer musical direction. Specifically, the reviewer for Alternative Press wrote [...] "Unfortunately, the visceral energy of their early days is lost in their newfound maturity." ...|$|E

Mustaine has said that at a show in Antrim, Northern Ireland, he discovered bootlegged Megadeth T-shirts were on sale. He was dissuaded from taking action to have them removed on the basis that they were part of fund raising activities for [...] "The Cause", explained <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> bring equality to Catholics and Protestants in the region.

500|$|Shortly {{after her}} The Labyrinth arena tour ended in July 2010, Lewis {{began to work}} on her third studio album. It was {{reported}} that Simon Cowell had set a deadline for Lewis to complete the album for a summer 2011 release. After originally having been given a release date of 28 November 2011, Glassheart was pushed back to March 2012. Lewis's reason for delaying {{the release of the}} album was that after she met producer Fraser T Smith, she wanted to collaborate with him on new material for possible inclusion on Glassheart. Lewis delayed the release of the album a third time, with Glassheart set for release on 26 November 2012. As a result of her fans having to wait until November 2012, a year after the album was originally set to be released, Lewis decided to release an extended play entitled Hurt: The EP, <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> [...] "bridge the gap" [...] while she recorded new material.|$|E
500|$|Barre wrote a {{work on the}} Bible {{entitled}} Compendium de veteri et novo testamento, {{which he}} dedicated to Longchamp. The work arranged passages from the Bible under topics, and then annotated the passages with marginal notations such as were done with glosses on Roman law. It is still extant in two manuscript (MS) copies, MS British Library Harley 3255, and Lambeth Palace MS 105. The Harley manuscript is shorter than the Lambeth manuscript. Richard Sharpe, a modern historian who studied both works, stated that the Harley manuscript [...] "provides [...] well structured and systematic (though not complete) coverage of the whole Bible." [...] Because of the dedication to William Longchamp as [...] "bishop, legate, and chancellor", {{it is likely that}} the work was composed between January 1190 and October 1191, as Longchamp only held those three offices together during that period. The prologue to the work describes it <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be used privately, and thus Sharpe feels that it was not intended to be a publicly published work; instead Barre may have intended it for Longchamp's private use in preparing sermons.|$|E
