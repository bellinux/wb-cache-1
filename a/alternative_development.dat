25|$|Following a {{decision}} of the Berlin House of Representatives, the goal is essentially to restore the S-Bahn network to its extent in 1961. This was stated in an agreement between Deutsche Bahn, the Federal Ministry of Transport and the Senate on 4 November 1993. The network was to be restored by 2002.

In a study of the transport development by the then Department for Transport and Commerce in 1995, a plan was published for a network. Only the Jungfernheide–Stresow, Spandau–Staaken and Zehlendorf–Düppel sections, which had existed until 1980, were not incorporated in these plans.

2500|$|Working {{with limited}} {{aid of the}} U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Peruvian Government carries out <b>alternative</b> <b>development</b> {{programs}} in the leading coca-growing areas {{in an effort to}} convince coca farmers not to grow that crop. Although the government previously eradicated only coca seed beds, in 1998 and 1999 it began to eradicate mature coca being grown in national parks and elsewhere in the main coca growing valleys. In 1999 the government eradicated more than 150km² of coca; this figure declined to 65km² in 2000, due largely to political instability. The government agency [...] "Contradrogas", founded in 1996, facilitates coordination among Peruvian Government agencies working on counter-narcotics issues.

2500|$|Whilst {{the above}} {{conception}} of aid {{has been the}} most pervasive within development geography work, {{it is important to remember}} that the aid landscape is far more complex than one directional flows from 'developed' to 'developing' countries. Development geographers have been at the forefront of research that aims to understand both the material exchanges and discourse surrounding 'South-South' development cooperation. 'Non-traditional' foreign aid from Southern, Middle Eastern and post-Socialist states (those outside the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD) provide <b>alternative</b> <b>development</b> discourses and approaches to that of the mainstream Western model. Development geographers seek to examine the geopolitical drivers behind the aid donor programmes of [...] "LEDCs", as well as the discursive symbolic repertoires of non-DAC donor states. Two illustrative examples of the complex aid landscape are that of China, which has been active as an aid donor throughout the latter half of the twentieth century but published its first report on foreign aid policy as recently as 2011 and India, an often cited aid recipient, but which has had donor programmes to Nepal and Bhutan since the 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the start}} of Plan Colombia, the main {{strategy}} for reducing cocaine production has been the aerial spraying of coca plantations with herbicides such as glyphosate. Since 2000 more than 1,600,000 hectares of coca crops have been sprayed and more than 413,000 have been manually eradicated. Aerial spraying of illicit crops is both very expensive and ineffective - for each hectare sprayed with glyphosate, coca crops are reduced by about 0.02 to 0.065 hectares, so 32 hectares of coca need to be sprayed to eradicate just one hectare (an effectiveness rate of just 4.2%). The marginal cost of removing one kilogram of cocaine from the market through spraying is roughly $240,000. Aerial spraying has {{a negative impact on}} the environment (deforestation, water pollution, harm to ecosystems), health (skin problems, respiratory illnesses, miscarriages) and causes internal displacement. After 2006, Colombian anti-drug policies shifted towards interdiction strategies (cocaine seizures, lab destruction, dismantling cartels) which have been far more effective than eradication strategies. These policies caused a major supply shock (increasing the street price of cocaine in the US), greatly reduced the net cocaine supply and led to major changes in the drug trafficking operations (shifting towards Central America and Mexico). Juan Manuel Santos, who had been responsible for the post-2006 drug strategy as defence minister, continued these policies as president. The Colombian government now addresses drug consumption from a public health angle and advocates for <b>alternative</b> <b>development</b> strategies in vulnerable regions affected by coca cultivation, while adopting a [...] "rational and efficient" [...] strategy against criminal activities tied to drug trafficking. As part of this new policy, in October 2015 the government ordered the suspension of aerial aspersion with glyphosate.|$|E

3000|$|CIB is a {{systematic}} yet qualitative form of systems analysis. It starts by building an impact network on future (societal) developments, i.e., {{a form of}} conceptual model. This impact network is based on expert judgments on the direction and strength of influences between <b>alternative</b> <b>developments</b> of system elements. System elements and their <b>alternative</b> <b>developments</b> are considered in their double role as influencing factors and as factors receiving influence. Impacts are assessed pairwise by using a semi-formalized scale (from strongly hindering to strongly promoting impacts). These assessments are underpinned with textual justifications. Assumptions are stored in a matrix, making the mental model(s) of those using the method explicit. The methodical core of CIB is a specific form of balance analysis. It allows for the identification of internally consistent network configurations, i.e., scenarios. The balance analysis {{is based on the}} information on the impact relations between the <b>alternative</b> <b>developments</b> of system elements. In CIB, those scenarios are defined as internally consistent, meaning that they are in accordance with the impact arguments of the impact network. This function of CIB can be used to support the construction and selection of qualitative scenarios. Overall, CIB has a medium degree of formalization. For instance, for single scenarios, the balance analysis can easily be done with pen and paper [21]. CIB has been applied as a qualitative scenario technique and stand-alone method in various fields ranging from the future of energy and sustainability to health and innovation issues. 24 [...]...|$|R
