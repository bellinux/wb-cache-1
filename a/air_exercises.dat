2500|$|However, India has {{not signed}} the CTBT, or the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, {{claiming}} the discriminatory {{nature of the}} treaty that allows the five declared nuclear {{countries of the world}} to keep their nuclear arsenal and develop it using computer simulation testing. Prior to its nuclear testing, India had pressed for a comprehensive destruction of nuclear weapons by all countries of the world in a time-bound frame. This was not favoured by the United States and by certain other countries. Presently, India has declared its policy of [...] "no-first use of nuclear weapons" [...] and the maintenance of a [...] "credible nuclear deterrence". The USA, under President George W. Bush has also lifted most of its sanctions on India and has resumed military co-operation. Relations with USA have considerably improved in the recent years, with the two countries taking part in joint naval exercises off the coast of India and joint <b>air</b> <b>exercises</b> both in India {{as well as in the}} United States.|$|E
2500|$|Portugal places its southernmost Exclusive Economic Zone claim {{south of}} the Savage Islands. Spain objects {{on the basis that}} the Savage Islands do not have a {{separate}} continental shelf, maintaining that the border should consist on an equidistant line drawn halfway between Madeira and the Canaries. According to article 121 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea: [...] "Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf." [...] The status of the Savage Islands as islands or rocks is thus {{at the core of the}} dispute. Despite the islands having numerous visitors, mostly for scientific purposes, and the fact that several settlements were tried throughout the centuries, today the Savage Islands are a special natural reserve whose only year-round inhabitants are the wardens of Madeira's Natural Park. Over the years, apart from the EEZ debate, a number of issues pertaining to the Savage Islands led to disputes between the two countries, namely the construction of a lighthouse, the administration of airspace (done from the closer Canary Islands), the right to perform military <b>air</b> <b>exercises,</b> and, most importantly, illegal fishing and poaching in the archipelago and its vicinity.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2005 by the American Physiological Society. 1 Athletes {{who perform}} {{repeated}} exercise while breathing cold air {{have a high}} prevalence of asthma-like chronic airway disease, but mechanism linking such activity to airway inflammation is unknown. We used a novel animal model (exercising horses) {{to test the hypothesis}} that exercise-induced chronic airway disease is caused by exposure of intrapulmonary airways to unconditioned air, resulting in the upregulation of cytokine expression. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from 8 horses 5 h after submaximal exercise while breathing room temperature or subfreezing air in a random crossover design. BALF total and differential nucleated cell counts were determined and relative cytokine mRNA expression in BALF nucleated cells was quantified using real-time RT-PCR using primer and probe sequences specific for equine targets. There were no significant changes in total or differential cell concentrations between BALF recovered after warm and cold <b>air</b> <b>exercise,</b> although there was a strong trend towards increased concentrations of airway epithelial cells after cold <b>air</b> <b>exercise</b> (p = 0. 0625). TH 2 cytokines Interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 5, and IL- 10 were preferentially upregulated after cold <b>air</b> <b>exercise</b> 12, 9, and 10 -fold, respectively, compared to warm <b>air</b> <b>exercise.</b> Other cytokines (IL- 2 and IL- 6) were upregulated to a lesser extent (6 and 3 -fold, respectively) or not at all (IL- 1, IL- 8, Interferon-γ, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α). These results suggest that cold weather exercise can lead to asthma-like airway disease through the local induction of cytokines typical of the TH 2 phenotype...|$|R
