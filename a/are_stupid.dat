A book symbolises the whole intellectual history of mankind; it's the greatest weapon ever devised in the war against stupidity. Beware of anyone who tries to make books harder to get at. And that is exactly what these closures are going to do – oh, not intentionally, except in a few cases; very few people <b>are</b> <b>stupid</b> intentionally; but that will be the effect. Books will be harder to get at. Stupidity will gain a little ground.|$|E

[...] always be , but their pranks {{will get more}} extravagant. If they earned £10 million, they'd blow it all by buying Jura or a fleet of K Foundation airships or a Van Gogh to be ceremonially burned." [...] "There are things we'd like to do which we haven't done.", Drummond told a journalist in 1991. [...] "Totally ludicrous things. We want to buy ships, have submarines. They really <b>are</b> <b>stupid</b> things I know, but I feel confident that {{in the event of}} us selling ten million albums we would definitely {{go out and buy a}} submarine....Just to be able to say 'Look we've got a submarine and 808 State haven't'." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{thousand}} young Asian professionals {{were surveyed}} on their {{opinions of the}} family, with most respondents saying the family were extremely unrealistic. One girl said, [...] "I think the Ferreiras are shit! The story lines <b>are</b> <b>stupid,</b> unrealistic and dull. Most Asians would not get evicted and then remain homeless, {{they would go to}} an aunty." [...] A female PR manager told the survey: [...] "Just how many shades of brown can there be in one family? You can't put them in any context. They have no background," [...] and another participant said, [...] "The Ferreiras should just be killed off. They are pointless, boring and the storylines are rubbish." [...] A barrister criticised the family's names, saying their first names were a mixture of Muslim and Hindu and their surname was Portuguese so the family should have been Catholic.|$|E

Willow panics, rejecting shirt after shirt, {{not knowing how to}} appear for Buffy and Dawn. She asks why her clothes <b>are</b> <b>stupid</b> and she is childish, weeping until Tara kisses and calms her. Anya asks Xander what she is supposed to do; he cannot answer. Willow changes her shirt again and Xander expresses his desire to find Glory and exact justice, then complains about Joyce's negligent doctors. Anya asks if they will see the body, then if the body will be cut open, and Willow responds angrily. Anya tearfully says she does not understand how to behave, or why Joyce cannot go back into her own body, unable to understand human death, she states that it is all [...] "stupid and mortal", and no one will tell her why things are happening. Xander puts his fist through the wall, making him bleed but feel oddly better. As the group leaves to visit Buffy at the hospital, Xander gets a parking ticket.|$|E

Therefore, all her sons come before her on the Strand in London, leaving half the kingdom depopulated, for she summons both dull writers, their booksellers, and all who <b>are</b> <b>stupid</b> enough to patronise dull writers.|$|E

2500|$|Rivers {{was open}} about her {{multiple}} cosmetic surgeries {{and was a}} patient of plastic surgeon Steven Hoefflin, beginning in 1983. She had her nose thinned while still at college; her next procedure, an eye lift, was performed in 1965 (when {{she was in her}} thirties) as an attempt to further her career. When promoting her book, Men <b>Are</b> <b>Stupid</b> ... And They Like Big Boobs: A Woman's Guide to Beauty Through Plastic Surgery, described by The New York Times Magazine as [...] "a detailed and mostly serious guide to eye lifts, tummy tucks and other forms of plastic surgery", she quipped: [...] "I've had so much plastic surgery, when I die they will donate my body to Tupperware." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Amanda Root for The Musical Express magazine, Ullman was asked about critics labeling the show 'non-sexist humour.' Did it exist? [...] "Not unless it’s cleverly done. When we did Three of a Kind we kept getting sketches sent in about me as a traffic warden, or me being a busty barmaid. Writers that have no idea about women - their typical way of starting a sketch is to say, Tracey is sitting there, filing her nails and chewing gum, as if all girls <b>are</b> <b>stupid.</b> Sketches beginning like that used to really get on my nerves. But {{as soon as we}} found the right team of writers, they weren’t into that sort of thing, so it worked out OK." [...] She went on to win her first BAFTA Award in the category of Best Light Entertainment Performance for Three of a Kind in 1984.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{both men}} are drunk, they both realize that she is back on morphine, {{although}} Mary attempts {{to act as if}} she is not. Jamie, has not returned home, but has elected instead to continue drinking and to visit the local whorehouse. After calling Jamie a [...] "hopeless failure" [...] Mary warns that his bad influence will drag his brother down as well. After seeing the condition that his wife is in, her husband expresses the regret that he bothered to come home, and he attempts to ignore her as she continues her remarks, which include blaming him for Jamie’s drinking, and noting that the Irish <b>are</b> <b>stupid</b> drunks. Then, as often happens in the play, Mary and James try to get over their animosity and attempt to express their love for one another by remembering happier days. When James goes to the basement to get another bottle of whiskey, Mary continues to talk with Edmund.|$|E

2500|$|If melee weapons {{could not}} be brought into combat, such as during long range defense, Qi {{recommended}} waiting [...] "until the face-the-enemy signal , and then, whether from behind wooden stockades, or from moat banks, or from below abatis (拒馬), [...] open up on the enemy, firing by turns (更番射賊). Those who are empty reload; those who are full fire again. While {{the ones who have}} fired are loading, those who are full then fire again. In this way, all day long, the firing of guns will not be lacking, and there must be no firing to the point of exhaustion [...] and no slipups with guns." [...] In 1571 Qi prescribed an ideal infantry regiment of 1080 arquebusiers out of 2700 men, or 40 percent of the infantry force. However it is not known how well this was actually implemented, and there is evidence that Qi was met with stiff resistance to the incorporation of newer gunpowder weapons in northern China while he was stationed there. He writes that [...] "in the north soldiers <b>are</b> <b>stupid</b> and impatient, {{to the point that they}} cannot see the strength of the musket, and they insist on holding tight to their fast lances (a type of fire lance), and although when comparing and vying on the practice field the musket can hit the bullseye ten times better than the fast-lance and five times better than the bow and arrow, they refuse to be convinced." ...|$|E
