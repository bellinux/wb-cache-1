40|$|The term “Management Loss”, from Total Productive Maintenance or TPM perspective, {{means the}} {{productivity}} losses {{in an organization}} due to delays or impedances caused by human. These include four kinds of losses: losses due to <b>awaiting</b> material, <b>awaiting</b> dolly, <b>awaiting</b> repair and <b>awaiting</b> cleaning. TPM aims to minimize these losses through the proper maintenance schemes. Therefore {{it is very important}} to get a proper view of these losses. But human losses are often taken as qualitative losses and their effects are not measured. This study, conducted in an eminent pharmaceutical industry of Bangladesh, presents a structured way of quantifying the management losses under TPM. A way of assessing and comparing the effects of delays was established...|$|R
