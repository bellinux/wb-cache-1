5|$|Distinctive nativity {{scenes and}} traditions {{have been created}} around the world, and are {{displayed}} during the Christmas season in churches, homes, shopping malls, and other venues, and occasionally on public lands <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>public</b> buildings.

5|$|In {{retirement}} Ford also devoted {{much time}} to his love of golf, often playing both privately <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>public</b> events with comedian Bob Hope, a longtime friend.

5|$|Nativity scenes {{have not}} escaped controversy. A life-sized {{scene in the}} United Kingdom {{featuring}} waxworks celebrities provoked outrage in 2004, and, in Spain, a city council forbade the exhibition of a traditional toilet humor character in a public nativity scene. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) indicates that animals in living displays lack proper care and suffer abuse. In the United States, nativity scenes on public lands <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>public</b> buildings have provoked court challenges, and the prankish theft of ceramic or plastic nativity figurines from outdoor displays has become commonplace.|$|E

5|$|The Sedition Act, Public Entertainments and Meetings Act, and Public Order Act 2009 are {{statutes}} which arguably impose {{restrictions on}} {{the freedom of speech}} and expression, as well as the freedom of assembly, in the interests of public order. The Sedition Act has been used to restrict the propagation of opinions that have a seditious tendency, which includes a tendency to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of Singapore's population. In Public Prosecutor v. Koh Song Huat Benjamin (2005), the accused was convicted under the Act for posting invective and pejorative anti-Muslim remarks on a blog and a forum on the Internet; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>Public</b> Prosecutor v. Ong Kian Cheong and another (2009), a married couple were similarly convicted for distributing religious tracts that were considered seditious and objectionable to Muslims. The Public Entertainments and Meetings Act renders it an offence to provide public entertainment and hold meetings without a licence, and its constitutionality has been upheld before the courts in cases concerning political activities organized by opposition parties.|$|E
