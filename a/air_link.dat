25|$|As {{the rest}} of 2 RAR began to dig in around Komoro Airport to secure the <b>air</b> <b>link</b> with Australia and {{launched}} a number of patrols throughout {{the western part of}} the Dili, 'C' Company was detached to secure the beachhead at the docks. With two M-113 APCs from 3/4 Cav to provide fire support, 'C' Company began moving towards the docks, but found the way blocked as they encountered a number of platoon-strength roadblocks that had been set up by the Indonesian military (TNI). Overcoming these obstacles by swarming over them in massed company formations, 'C' Company eventually reached the dock where they encountered large numbers of refugees as well as groups of Indonesian military and militia. A tense stand-off followed as the Australians set about the task of securing the port in preparation for the arrival of the follow-on seaborne forces that were to land the following day.|$|E
500|$|At , {{the fleet}} {{comprised}} one Dove, eight Herons and eight DC-3s. In early 1961, Nigeria {{became the only}} owner of the company by buying the shares held by BOAC and Elder Dempster; the airline became the flag carrier of the country. The entire Heron fleet was withdrawn from service in March 1961 as [...] it proved economically inviable. Aimed at replacing the DC-3 fleet, five Fokker Friendship 200s were ordered late that year, with options being taken on two more. A BOAC Comet 4 inaugurated the jet services between Nigeria and London on the flight was operated in conjunction with Nigeria Airways. The Friendships joined the fleet between January and May 1963, and were deployed on regional routes, including those that served Abidjan, Accra, Bathurst, Dakar, Freetown and Robertsfield. The contract with BOAC was revised and a new agreement was signed in April of the same year. By June, the DC-3s had begun {{to be replaced by}} the Friendships on routes to Gambia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Leopoldville. However, the type would continue to be deployed on the Kano–Cotonou–Lomé–Accra passenger service and the Lagos-Kano freighter route. BOAC subsequently operated Vickers VC-10 services on behalf of Nigeria Airways from April 1964 until an aircraft of the type was acquired from the British state airline in the airplane was destroyed in an accident in November that year. The first <b>air</b> <b>link</b> between Nigeria and the United States was launched in early [...] Called ″Operation Fantastic", it linked Lagos with New York and was operated by PanAm using Boeing 707s and DC-8s, but an agreement between both countries allowed Nigeria Airways to sell a limited number of seats on these flights.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of {{international}} long-distance flights on the global spatial allocation of economic activity. To identify causal effects, we exploit variation due to regulatory and technological constraints which {{give rise to a}} discontinuity in connectedness between cities at a distance of 6000 miles. We show that these <b>air</b> <b>links</b> {{have a positive effect on}} local economic activity, as captured by satellite-measured night lights. To shed light on how <b>air</b> <b>links</b> shape economic outcomes, we first present evidence of positive externalities in the global network of air links: connections induce further connections. We then find that <b>air</b> <b>links</b> increase business links, showing that the movement of people fosters the movement of capital. In particular, this is driven mostly by capital flowing from high-income to middle-income (but not low-income) countries. Taken together, our results suggest that increasing interconnectedness generates economic activity at the local level by inducing links between businesses, but also gives rise to increased spatial inequality locally, and potentially globally...|$|R
