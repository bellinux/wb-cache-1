5|$|A {{controlled}} {{comparative study}} by the Navy Experimental Diving Unit in the NEDU Ocean Simulation Facility wet-pot comparing the VVAL18 Thalmann Algorithm with a deep stop profile suggests that the deep stops schedule had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of DCS than the matched (same total stop time) conventional schedule. The proposed explanation was that slower gas washout or continued gas uptake offset benefits of reduced bubble growth at deep stops.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy for {{prostate}} cancer may cause erectile dysfunction in approximately 15-30% of patients. However, the risk of erectile dysfunction is related to age (older men are at <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> than younger men) and also the level of erectile function prior to receiving brachytherapy. In patients who do experience erectile dysfunction, {{the majority of cases}} can successfully be treated with drugs such as Viagra. Importantly, the risk of erectile dysfunction after brachytherapy is less than after radical prostatectomy.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{sex workers}} (including those in pornography) have an {{increased}} rate of HIV. Rough sex can be a factor {{associated with an increased}} risk of transmission. Sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, and there may be <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of breast cancer for the next twenty years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring breast cancer, the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and breast cancer is viewed as dubious.|$|E
5|$|If {{the pain}} is still not managed adequately, short term use of opioids such as {{morphine}} may be useful. These medications carry a risk of addiction, may have negative interactions with other drugs, and have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of side effects, including dizziness, nausea, and constipation. The effect of long term use is unknown. Specialist groups advise against general long-term use of opioids for chronic low back pain.|$|E
5|$|Intense and {{prolonged}} exposure to workplace dusts, chemicals and fumes {{increase the risk}} of COPD in both smokers and nonsmokers. Workplace exposures are believed to be the cause in 10â€“20% of cases.

5|$|The {{side effects}} of {{amphetamine}} are varied, {{and the amount of}} amphetamine used is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Amphetamine products such as Adderall, Dexedrine, and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the USFDA for long-term therapeutic use. Recreational use of amphetamine generally involves much larger doses, which have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of serious side effects than dosages used for therapeutic reasons.|$|E
5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake {{is associated with}} <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of stroke, total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, {{a decrease in the}} intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E

5|$|MS is not {{considered}} a hereditary disease; however, a number of genetic variations {{have been shown to}} increase the risk. Some of these genes appear to have higher levels of expression in microglial cells than expected by chance. The probability of developing the disease is higher in relatives of an affected person, with <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> among those more closely related. In identical twins both are affected about 30% of the time, while around 5% for non-identical twins and 2.5% of siblings are affected with a lower percentage of half-siblings. If both parents are affected the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population. MS is also more common in some ethnic groups than others.|$|E
5|$|This gender {{discrepancy}} {{is often}} distorted in specific populations where rates of self-harm are inordinately high, {{which may have}} implications on the significance and interpretation of psychosocial factors other than gender. A study in 2003 found an extremely high prevalence of self-harm among 428 homeless and runaway youths (aged 1619) with 72% of males and 66% of females reporting a history of self-harm. However, in 2008, a study of young people and self-harm saw the gender gap close, with 32% of young females, and 22% of young males admitting to self-harm. Studies also indicate that males who self-harm may also be at <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of completing suicide.|$|E
5|$|Type II endometrial carcinomas usually {{occur in}} older, post-menopausal people, in the United States {{are more common}} in black women, and are not {{associated}} with increased exposure to estrogen or a history of endometrial hyperplasia. Type II endometrial cancers are often high-grade, with deep invasion into the underlying uterine wall (myometrium), are of the serous or clear cell type, and carry a poorer prognosis. They can appear to be epithelial ovarian cancer on evaluation of symptoms. They tend to present later than Type I tumors and are more aggressive, with <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of relapse and/or metastasis.|$|E

5|$|Typically, people {{infected}} with dengue virus are asymptomatic (80%) or have only mild {{symptoms such as}} an uncomplicated fever. Others have more severe illness (5%), and in a small proportion it is life-threatening. The incubation period (time between exposure and onset of symptoms) ranges from 3 to 14 days, but most often it is 4 to 7 days. Therefore, travelers returning from endemic areas are unlikely to have dengue if fever or other symptoms start more than 14days after arriving home. Children often experience symptoms {{similar to those of}} the common cold and gastroenteritis (vomiting and diarrhea) and have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of severe complications, though initial symptoms are generally mild but include high fever.|$|E
5|$|Cannon Fodder 2 is a military-themed action {{game with}} {{strategy}} and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad {{of up to}} four soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles and missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must use secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates â€“ destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion â€“ at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of depleting ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epsteinâ€“Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E

5|$|Health {{issues in}} American {{football}} comprise {{a large number}} of health risks associated with participating in the sport. Injuries are relatively common in American football, due to its nature as a full-contact game. Injuries occur during both practice and games. Several factors can affect the frequency of injuries: epidemiological studies have shown older players can be at <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk,</b> while equipment and experienced coaches can reduce the risk of injury. Common injuries include strains, sprains, fractures, dislocations, and concussions. Concussions have become a concern, as they increase the risk of mental illnesses like dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In individual leagues like the National Football League (NFL) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), a public injury report is published containing all injured players on a team, their injury and the game-day status of each player.|$|E
5|$|Iginla has {{recorded}} several Gordie Howe hat tricks â€“ a fight, a goal and an {{assist in the}} same game â€“ and as {{it is not an}} official statistic, The Hockey News estimated that as of 2012, he was the active leader with nine. His fights, including one with Tampa Bay Lightning star Vincent Lecavalier in the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, have had a motivating effect on his play and that of his teammates. Iginla has suffered injuries {{as a result of his}} fighting, including a broken hand from a 2003 fight with Bill Guerin of the Dallas Stars. His physical style of play also leads to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of persistent injuries and penalties. Iginla's truculent style of play has gained approval from hockey commentator Don Cherry.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} a {{district}} general hospital in the UK, 5.4% of all the hospital's self-harm cases were aged over 65. The male to female ratio was 2:3 although the self-harm rates {{for males and females}} over 65 in the local population were identical. Over 90% had depressive conditions, and 63% had significant physical illness. Under 10% of the patients gave a history of earlier self-harm, while both the repetition and suicide rates were very low, which could be explained by the absence of factors known to be associated with repetition, such as personality disorder and alcohol abuse. However, NICE Guidance on Self-harm in the UK suggests that older people who self-harm are at <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>risk</b> of completing suicide, with 1 in 5 older people who self-harm going on to end their life. A study completed in Ireland showed that older Irish adults have high rates of deliberate self-harm, but comparatively low rates of suicide.|$|E
