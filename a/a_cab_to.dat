5|$|It was {{reported}} that the plan to rid Richter of the title was concocted by WWF Chairman Vince McMahon, who brought in Moolah after Richter refused to sign a new contract with the WWF. Richter, however, claims she was still under her original five-year contract, but that she regularly had disagreements with McMahon about her compensation. She also claims that when {{she arrived at the}} arena that day, she was surprised to find Moolah backstage, as she never showed up to events at which she was not scheduled to wrestle. After the match, an infuriated Richter left the arena in her wrestling gear, took <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> the airport, and booked herself on a flight out of New York. Afterward, she never spoke to Moolah again.|$|E
5|$|Despite their celebrated {{success at}} turning {{spectacular}} plays in collaboration, {{relations between the}} teammates {{were said to have}} been often strained. Tinker and Evers feuded for many years. On September 14, 1905, Tinker and Evers engaged in a fistfight on the field because Evers had taken <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> the stadium and left his teammates behind in the hotel lobby. They did not speak for years following this event. According to some tellings, Tinker and Evers did not speak to one another again following their fight for 33 years, until they were asked to participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series, between the Cubs and the New York Yankees. Neither Tinker nor Evers knew the other had been invited. However, in 1929, Tinker joined Evers in signing a ten-week contract to perform a theatrical skit on baseball in different cities across the United States.|$|E
5|$|In May and June 2010, Wu participated {{with his}} father in filming for the 17th season of The Amazing Race, an American reality {{television}} game show. Upon this announcement, {{it was also the}} first time his dad's name, Michael, was revealed, which was kept anonymous since his debut. Wu officially announced his participation on Facebook on September 1, and on YouTube a week later. The season premiered on September 26, 2010. Michael and Kevin's best placement was a third-place finish in Leg 2 and Leg 6. Their worst placement was a last place finish (9th) in Leg 3, a non-elimination leg. They ended up in seventh place and were eliminated in Leg 7 after being issued two 30-minute penalties for using <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> travel between tasks on the leg when they were instructed to walk; another team had also issued a similar penalty and checked in after them, but only had one half-hour penalty, resulting in Kevin and Michael's elimination.|$|E

Under cover of night, he scaled a nearby fence and hailed <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> Grand Central Terminal. After stopping in The Bronx to change clothes {{and pick up a}} set of keys to a Montreal bank safe deposit box containing $20,000, Abagnale caught a train to Montreal's Dorval airport to purchase a ticket to São Paulo, Brazil. After a close call at a Mac's Milk, he was apprehended by a constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police while standing in line at the ticket counter. Abagnale was subsequently handed over to the U.S. Border Patrol.|$|E
25|$|Luttrell wrote a {{note and}} asked that it {{be taken to the}} American base at Asadabad. Because Gulab had {{previously}} met the Marine commander based at Nangalam, he asked an older man named Shina, of another part of the village of Salar Ban, to make the trek with the note to that base instead. This required a longer journey down the trails of the Shuryek valley to Matin, where he then hired <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> drive the Pech road to Nangalam. Gulab gave Shina 1,000 Afghanis (about twenty U.S. dollars). When Shina reached the base in Nangalam {{in the middle of the}} night he met with the commander and related the story about a wounded American soldier in their village. He then gave him the note that Luttrell had written.|$|E

Immediately after the show Castillo took <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> nearby Cedars Sinai Hospital where he collapsed as he was being admitted. The doctors discovered a duodenal ulcer that had ruptured his stomach and performed emergency surgery that saved Castillo’s life. While taking time off from Mötley Crüe to recover from his surgery, he discovered a small lump on his jaw and a month later, after it had grown to roughly the size of a golf ball, he sought treatment and was diagnosed with Squamous cell Carcinoma, a common form of cancer that is not usually fatal if it is discovered early but can spread rapidly if left untreated. The cancer went into remission in mid-2001, and he was rumored to be rejoining Osbourne's solo band for that summer Ozzfest tour (along with Geezer Butler on bass), though these rumors were later revealed to be untrue.|$|E

500|$|Due to poorer quality track {{than was}} the norm in its native England, the {{locomotive}} had much trouble with derailment; the C's engineers added a leading truck (an assembly consisting of an unpowered axle with smaller diameter wheels that {{was connected to the}} frame and pushed in front of the locomotive) to help guide the engine into curves. [...] The leading truck's mechanism necessitated the removal of the coupling rod between the two main axles, leaving only the rear axle powered. Effectively, the John Bull became a 4-2-0 (a locomotive with two unpowered axles, one powered main axle, and no trailing axles). Later, the C also added a pilot ("cowcatcher") to the lead truck. [...] The cowcatcher is an angled assembly designed to deflect animals and debris off of the railroad track in front of the locomotive. To protect the locomotive's crew from the weather, the C also added walls and a roof (<b>a</b> <b>cab)</b> <b>to</b> the rear of the locomotive where the controls were located. C workshop crews also added safety features such as a bell and headlight.|$|E

He hails <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> get to the hospital Angie is at, but realizes that he does not have money on him, however, the driver does not mind. Once inside the cab, the driver, Ben Bailey—the host of the game show Cash Cab—informs Tracy that he is a contestant. As part of the game, Tracy must answer questions to win money and reach his destination. As a result, Tracy answers all the questions correctly and arrives at the hospital in time to witness the birth of his daughter.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of October 16 to 17, 1982, Parsons met David Wood in Las Vegas and took <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> the Strip in search of marijuana. Near the destination, Parsons pointed a [...]22-caliber {{revolver}} at the driver's neck to rob him. After stealing the driver's taxi, the two were caught in an alley and placed under citizen's arrest by Charles Conant and his brother-in-law Ronald Maske, who were both armed with guns. During trial, Parsons characterized himself as an orphan who stayed out of trouble and testified against Wood. The court did {{not have access to}} Parsons' juvenile record, and was unaware of his parents on the East Coast. Parsons later stated that he provided false testimony against Wood in a plea bargain for a lighter sentence. Wood was convicted and spent 13 years in prison. No visitors came to see Parsons during his five years at Nevada State Prison. In August 1987, Parsons was paroled to a halfway house in Reno. He walked out of the facility before his release date and fled on a stolen motorcycle.|$|E

500|$|Toward {{the end of}} the essay, Gibson briefly covers two {{applications}} of the death penalty by the Singaporean justice system; he excerpts a report from The Straits Times about , a Malay man sentenced to death for attempting to smuggle a kilogram of cannabis into the city-state, and follows this with a description of the case of Johannes van Damme, a Dutch engineer found with significant quantities of heroin with the same consequence. He expresses reservations about the justice of capital punishment and describes the Singaporeans as the true bearers of zero tolerance. After hearing the announcement of van Damme's sentencing, Gibson decides to leave, checks out [...] "in record time" [...] from the hotel, and catches <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> the airport. The trip is conspicuous for the absence of police along the road, but there is an abundance of them at the Changi Airtropolis, where Gibson photographs a discarded piece of crumpled paper, incurring their ire. Flying into Hong Kong he briefly glimpses the soon-to-be-destroyed shantytown Kowloon Walled City {{at the end of one}} of the runways at the chaotic Kai Tak Airport, and muses about the contrast with the staid and sanitized city-state he has left behind. The essay ends with the declaration [...] "I loosened my tie, clearing Singapore airspace." ...|$|E
500|$|Among {{the more}} hostile press reviews {{was that of}} Le Figaros critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work [...] "a {{laborious}} and puerile barbarity" [...] and added [...] "We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely [...] "a rowdy debate" [...] between two ill-mannered factions. Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote: [...] "Couldn't we ask M. Astruc... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators?... We could at least propose to evict the female element". The composer Alfredo Casella thought that the demonstrations were aimed at Nijinsky's choreography {{rather than at the}} music, a view shared by the critic Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi, who wrote: [...] "The idea was excellent, but was not successfully carried out". Calvocoressi failed to observe any direct hostility to the composer—unlike, he said, the premiere of Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande in 1902. Of later reports that the veteran composer Camille Saint-Saëns had stormed out of the premiere, Stravinsky observed that this was impossible; Saint-Saëns did not attend. Stravinsky also rejected Cocteau's story that, after the performance, Stravinsky, Nijinsky, Diaghilev and Cocteau himself took <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> the Bois de Boulogne where a tearful Diaghilev recited poems by Pushkin. Stravinsky merely recalled a celebratory dinner with Diaghilev and Nijinsky, at which the impresario expressed his entire satisfaction with the outcome. To Maximilien Steinberg, a former fellow-pupil under Rimsky-Korsakov, Stravinsky wrote that Nijinsky's choreography had been [...] "incomparable: {{with the exception of a}} few places, everything was as I wanted it".|$|E

2500|$|Yellow Cab of Pittsburgh is {{the main}} taxicab company in Pittsburgh, with over 300 {{vehicles}} in its fleet, all later model sedans and vans in good, PUC-inspected condition, as mandated by the Public Utility Commission of Pennsylvania.

In addition to the typical Yellow Cab vehicles, there is <b>a</b> Green <b>Cab</b> (ecologically green), <b>a</b> few Pink <b>Cabs</b> (<b>to</b> promote breast cancer awareness), <b>a</b> Red <b>Cab</b> (<b>to</b> promote heart health) and <b>a</b> couple Blue <b>Cabs</b> (<b>to</b> promote prostate health).

500|$|Trump had {{originally}} {{promised that the}} Bonwit Teller building's Art Deco exterior limestone bas-relief sculptures of semi-nude goddesses, {{as well as the}} massive ornate 15-by-25 foot grille above the store's entrance, would be removed and be donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The museum appraised the sculptures at over $200,000. However, the sculptures ended up being destroyed because, according to Trump, there were general hazard concerns, expense, and a possible 10-day construction delay due to the difficulty of removing them. The Met's curator, Penelope Hunter-Stiebel, caught <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> the building site and attempted to pay the workmen for the sculptures, but was rebuffed. The building's decorative grille, supposedly transported to a New Jersey warehouse, was never recovered. Instead the sculptures and grilles were scrapped, and several days later, Trump stated that he had ordered the destruction himself. Later in 1980, he boasted that the decor of his Grand Hyatt New York included [...] "real art, not like the junk I destroyed at Bonwit Teller". The New York Times condemned Trump's actions as [...] "esthetic vandalism", and a spokesman for Mayor Ed Koch said Trump had failed his [...] "moral responsibility to consider the interests {{of the people of the}} city". Scutt was outraged by the destruction, having initially hoped to incorporate the goddess sculptures into the new building's lobby design; Trump had rejected the plan, preferring something [...] "more contemporary". Robert Miller, the gallery owner who had appraised the pieces, lamented that such things would [...] "never be made again", and Peter M. Warner, a researcher who worked across the street, called the destruction [...] "regrettable". However, Trump later said that he used the notoriety of that act to advertise more residential units in the tower.|$|E
2500|$|On one {{occasion}} Guiteau trailed Garfield to the railway station as the President was seeing his wife {{off to a}} beach resort in Long Branch, New Jersey, but he decided to postpone his plan because Garfield's wife, Lucretia, was in poor health and Guiteau {{did not want to}} upset her. On July 2, 1881, he lay in wait for Garfield at the since demolished Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station, getting his shoes shined, pacing, and engaging <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> take him to the jail later. As Garfield entered the station, looking forward to a vacation with his wife in Long Branch, Guiteau stepped forward and shot Garfield twice from behind, the second shot piercing the first lumbar vertebra but missing the spinal cord.

2500|$|During production, {{management}} booked {{dates for}} the band's upcoming European tour. This proved {{a problem for}} Thomas as he felt the album needed more songs. Thomas recalls, [...] "They had an incredible momentum building and were gaining fans all the time. There was an audience waiting for the product, but I decided that they didn't have the right songs yet". Thomas persuaded primary songwriters Hutchence and Andrew to fly to Hong Kong (where Hutchence and drummer Jon Farriss owned an apartment) to write more material for Kick. While waiting for <b>a</b> <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> go {{to the airport to}} fly to Hong Kong, Andrew thought up the famous guitar riff for [...] "Need You Tonight". He told the cab driver to wait a couple of minutes while {{he went back to his}} motel room to grab something. In fact, he went back record the riff on cassette. The cab driver was furious when Andrew returned to the cab forty-five minutes later. When Hutchence heard the demo in Hong Kong, he began to write the song's lyrics, penning them in just ten minutes.|$|E
