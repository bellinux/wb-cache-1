5|$|Most of the {{casualties}} and damage were caused by a tsunami affecting the west coasts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, {{and it was one}} of three tsunamis to occur within a span of six months. Runup heights were measured shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> and reached heights of up to 9.9 meters, though the average height was 3 to 8 meters. The tsunami was disproportionately large for its surface wave magnitude, or Ms, and the duration of the rupture process was 100 s, unusually long for its size. The moment magnitude was 7.6, larger than the 20-s Ms of 7; this Ms–Mw difference is a characteristic of tsunami earthquakes. Tide gages were set up at Corinto and Puerto Sandino, which showed an impulsive tsunami originating 61 minutes <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake.</b> It ran inland 1,000 meters to Masachapa, the hardest hit major town of all, with 9 fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-five years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake,</b> {{the largest}} earthquake-monitoring network nationally was {{established}} in Yunnan.

5|$|Soon <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake,</b> the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration {{ordered a}} ground stop along the East Coast, causing some flight delays. The Air Traffic Control tower at John F. Kennedy International Airport was evacuated. Flights were delayed at several airports, {{including}} John F.

At Ronald Reagan National Airport, ceiling tiles fell in one terminal, and flights were halted.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the {{possibility}} of aftershocks, police evacuated shopping malls and office buildings around the city. Essential organisations in the area were evacuated as a safety precaution, including the police headquarters and offices of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. At Christchurch International Airport, officials halted operations <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake,</b> but all flights resumed later that day. Months before the event, a severe magnitude 6.3 earthquake occurred in a similar area adjacent to Christchurch, causing widespread destruction and fatalities in the city. Concerns arose about the condition of previously damaged structures, and the 13 June earthquakes caused further distress among many victims. Dozens of dissatisfied residents were expected {{to move out of the}} city, and many others sought professional help for anxiety and depression-related issues.|$|E
5|$|Many Massachusetts {{residents}} of the time perceived the quake as punishment from God for immoral behavior. In the days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake,</b> special prayer services were held and civic authorities declared fast days. A number of sermons and other writings were published as a consequence, including Jeremiah Newland's Verses Occasioned by the Earthquakes in the Month of November, 1755 and Thomas Prince's Earthquakes the Works of God and Tokens of his Just Displeasure. Not all explanations of the event were theological; John Winthrop, a Harvard professor, proposed an alternate explanation {{having to do with}} heat and chemical vapors inside the surface of the earth.|$|E

5|$|The Fakahani Mosque exemplifies this process. It {{was built}} in the Fatimid period, either as a {{suspended}} mosque (one with shops underneath it) or with a high basement. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> of 1302 it was rebuilt. In 1440 an ablution basin was added, and early in the Ottoman period a minaret was built. The amir Ahmad Katkhuda Mustahfazan al-Kharbutli in 1735 ordered a major reconstruction, almost all of the original building being replaced apart from two doors. These finely carved doors were registered as a historical monument in 1908 by the committee of conservation, and the building itself was registered in 1937.|$|E
5|$|When {{writing the}} album's lyrics, Yamaguchi tried to express both the {{feelings}} that he had, and those that he saw were common in society in the early 2010s. He focused on questioning what {{the role of a}} musician was during this period; and attempted to represent the idea of certain types of people existing in 2011, making certain types of music. He believed that the true role of a musician had become strongly evident <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake.</b> The band also tried to express 2011 sonically, through the style of synths that pianist Emi Okazaki created for the songs.|$|E
5|$|With the {{annexation}} of Jerusalem by Egypt in 1831, a new opportunity arose for the Perushim. They petitioned Muhammad Ali regarding {{the rebuilding of}} the synagogue, but concerns about deviating from longstanding Muslim tradition and the Pact of Umar (which restricted the repair or construction of non-Muslim houses of worship) meant permission was not forthcoming. However, five months <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> of May 1834, the prohibition was relaxed and the Sephardim were allowed to carry out repair works to their existing synagogues. This consent gave rise to further efforts by the Ashkenazim to receive authorisation to rebuild theirs.|$|E

5|$|Gorbachev {{set aside}} 5 billion rubles (about $8 billion U.S. dollars) in {{funds for a}} start on what would likely be a {{recovery}} cost that would exceed the cleanup bill for the 1986 nuclear and radiation accident in Ukraine. While foreign doctors did assist with the Chernobyl incident, the Soviet relief effort <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> was augmented by the largest foreign cooperation since World War II. That deluge of western aid was a byproduct of the disaster that {{may have had a}} positive effect on Soviet Union–United States relations. The cost of rebuilding would be a severe obstacle for Perestroika, Gorbachev's plan for economic restructuring. Another adverse effect of the disaster was that the Armenians were already distrustful of Gorbachev's dismissal of their claims to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which the Armenians had been contesting with neighboring Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|In Sicily, the {{decision}} was taken not just for fashion and appearance {{but also because it}} would minimise the damage to property and life likely to be caused in future quakes. In 1693, the cramped housing and streets had caused buildings to collapse together like dominoes. Although <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> the avenues were broadened and the density of housing was lowered overall, cramped and narrow areas of housing still remained, posing a hazard for the poor. Architecturally and aesthetically, the big advantage of the new order of town planning was that unlike many Italian towns and cities, where one frequently encounters a monumental Renaissance church squeezed terrace fashion between incongruous neighbours, in urban Baroque design one can step back and actually see the architecture in a more conducive setting in relation to its proportions and perspective. This is most notable in the largely rebuilt towns of Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa, and Scicli.|$|E
5|$|Sicily's second city, Catania, was {{the most}} damaged of all the larger cities in 1693, with only the medieval Castello Ursino and three tribunes of the cathedral remaining. Thus it was replanned and rebuilt. The new design {{separated}} the city into quarters, divided by two roads meeting at an intersection known as the Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral Square). Rebuilding was supervised by the Bishop of Catania, and the city's only surviving architect, Alonzo di Benedetto. Di Benedetto headed a team of junior architects called in from Messina, which quickly began to rebuild, concentrating first on the Piazza del Duomo. Three palazzi are situated here, the Bishop's Palace, the Seminario and one other. The architects worked in complete harmony and {{it is impossible to}} distinguish di Benedetto's work from that of his junior colleagues. The work is competent but not remarkable, with decorated rustication in the 17th-century Sicilian style, but often the decoration on the upper floors is superficial. This is typical of the Baroque of this period immediately <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> <b>the</b> {{city was}} {{affected}} by heavy rains which made the problems of sanitation worse. Over {{the next few weeks}} an estimated 2,000 people died of [...] "chabalongo", the name then used for typhus.|$|R

50|$|There {{were many}} {{landslides}} throughout the island. The largest, the Judgement Cliff landslide, displaced the land surface {{by up to}} 800 m and killed 19 people. Several rivers were temporarily dammed {{and a few days}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquakes</b> <b>the</b> harbour became flooded with large numbers of trees stripped of their bark brought down after one of these dams was breached.|$|R
5|$|The Sicilian Baroque style came to {{fruition}} during a major surge of rebuilding following the massive earthquake in 1693. Previously, the Baroque style {{had been used}} on the island in a naïve and parochial manner, having evolved from hybrid native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of Rome. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake,</b> local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; the work of these local architects — and the new genre of architectural engravings that they pioneered — inspired more local architects to follow their lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence {{in their use of}} the Baroque style. Their particular interpretation led to further evolution to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly fashionable neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 season had a minor hiccup at {{the very}} {{beginning}} with a two-point loss to the Blues. Their second round match against the Hurricanes was cancelled, and match declared a draw after the Christchurch earthquake on 22 February which caused 182 deaths. In their first match <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>earthquake</b> they played the Waratahs, a team that had only conceded six points in their previous two games. The Crusaders triumphed 33–18 in a convincing display in front of a sold-out stadium. They next played the Brumbies and brushed them aside in a 52–10 demolition. They next played the Highlanders who had previously only lost one match in the season, to the undefeated and table-topping Stormers. The Crusaders won comfortably 44–13 in Dunedin. The next team they played, the Sharks, had like the Highlanders previously only lost one match in the season before the Crusaders won 44–28 at Twickenham for a one off match due to earthquake damage at their own ground. They played the second match in Timaru Alpine Stadium against the Bulls in a sell out crowd winning 27–0. Round 9 they played the Chiefs in Mt Maunganui and gained four tries winning 34–16 with Richie McCaw returning after eight weeks off with injury.|$|E
