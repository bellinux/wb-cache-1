50|$|As of January 2014, Shopcade has {{mobile apps}} for iOS and Android {{operating}} systems, {{along with its}} website. Users can create an account via Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and e-mail. Users can log {{in to see the}} daily trending feed, a collection of new celebrity and blogger styles, new trends from magazines and Shopcade curators, and new collections and deals from brands. Users can buy items from the relevant retail site or save them to wish lists for later. When items that a user has saved are on sale or a deal is being offered, Shopcade alerts the user via the mobile app or on e-mail. Users can also use the bookmarklet tool (that can be <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the <b>bookmark</b> bar) <b>to</b> <b>add</b> any product <b>to</b> Shopcade from other websites. Bloggers and publishers have access to a Shopcade widget to display their selections of products on their own websites.|$|R
50|$|In late 2006, Yahoo! {{introduced}} an improved Yahoo! Bookmarks service, with a tagging facility, and encouraged My Web users <b>to</b> transfer their <b>bookmarks</b> <b>to</b> this service.|$|R
50|$|A simple JavaScript {{function}} labeled Google Bookmark {{is created}} on the Firefox Bookmarks Toolbar, which opens a window <b>to</b> save the <b>bookmark</b> <b>to</b> the Google <b>Bookmarks.</b> This same function can be imported into other browsers as a bookmarklet.|$|R
5000|$|The button <b>to</b> <b>add</b> a <b>bookmark</b> is now {{attached}} <b>to</b> {{the address}} bar by default.|$|R
50|$|On 1 June 2017, Pinboard {{acquired}} Delicious. Delicious {{users will}} no longer be able <b>to</b> save new <b>bookmarks</b> after June 15, 2017. Delicious users have the option <b>to</b> migrate their <b>bookmarks</b> <b>to</b> a Pinboard subscription account instead. The ultimate fate of Delicious has not yet been announced.|$|R
50|$|Websites {{built on}} {{technologies}} such as Adobe Flash and AJAX often do not support deep linking. This can cause usability problems for visitors to those sites. For example, they may be unable <b>to</b> save <b>bookmarks</b> <b>to</b> individual pages or states of the site, use the web browser forward and back buttons—and clicking the browser refresh button may return the user to the initial page.|$|R
25|$|The April 17, 2012 update, {{included}} the availability to access in 31 additional languages {{and in all}} countries where Google Play is available. A desktop version of a website can also be requested {{as opposed to a}} mobile version. In addition, Android users can now <b>add</b> <b>bookmarks</b> <b>to</b> their Android home screens if they choose and decide which apps should handle links opened in Chrome.|$|R
50|$|Opera 28 was {{released}} on March 10, 2015, based on Chromium 41. Starting with this version, bookmarks can be synchronized between Opera on the desktop, Opera Mobile on Android and Opera Mini on Android and iOS. Support for batch operation was <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the <b>bookmark</b> manager and bookmark suggestions now appear when typing in the address bar.|$|R
5000|$|The browser also {{included}} URL self-correction, which corrected common URL misspellings,an improved FTP listing interface and a dedicated News menu with integration to the Netscape.com news portal. A quick [...] "link pad" [...] was {{also included}} so Web pages could quickly be <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the pad for later viewing without <b>adding</b> <b>to</b> the <b>bookmark</b> lists.Navigator 9 also sees the browser return to multi-platform support across Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Netscape's signature splash screen also reappeared in the release {{candidate of the}} final program.|$|R
5000|$|Dynamic Web page updates {{also make}} it {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>bookmark</b> and return <b>to</b> a particular state of the application. Solutions to this problem exist, many of which again use the URL fragment identifier. On the other hand, as AJAX-intensive pages tend to function as applications rather than content, bookmarking interim states rarely makes sense. Nevertheless, the solution provided by HTML5 for the above problem also applies for this.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} the PDF Object Linking Extension (POLE) {{and how it}} came about. POLE {{is an extension of}} an existing DXL script called Outdoors that provides a linking mechanism to files outside of DOORS. Our modifications expand the script's capabilities <b>to</b> link <b>to</b> <b>bookmarks</b> within PDF documents. PDF linking allows for traceability to be maintained between DOORS objects and the requirements within PDF files...|$|R
5000|$|Vivaldi {{features}} {{the ability to}} [...] "stack" [...] and [...] "tile" [...] tabs, annotate web pages, and <b>add</b> notes <b>to</b> <b>bookmarks.</b> Furthermore, users can place digital bookmarks on a [...] "speed dial" [...] page for quick access and harness [...] "quick commands" [...] <b>to</b> search <b>bookmarks,</b> browsing history, open tabs, and settings. Vivaldi is built around and based on web technologies such as HTML5, Node.js, React.js, and numerous NPM modules. As of Technical Preview 4, Vivaldi also supports numerous mouse gestures for actions like tab switching and keyboard activation. Vivaldi can also be set to a [...] "Chromeless UI", which gives users more screen real-estate {{and the ability to}} focus on a single page without distractions. To accommodate users who prefer to utilise a large number of tabs at the same time, Vivaldi supports hibernation for both individual tabs and for tab stacks, freeing resources while the user does not actively use those tabs.|$|R
50|$|Trillian Pro {{comes with}} Activity History, and both log the history as both plain text files and as XML files. Pro has a History Manager {{that shows the}} chat history and allows the user <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>bookmarks</b> for {{revision}} later on. XML-based history makes the log easy to manipulate, searchable and extendable for future functions.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike file sharing, social {{bookmarking}} does not save the resources themselves, merely bookmarks that reference them, i.e. {{a link to}} the bookmarked page. Descriptions may be <b>added</b> <b>to</b> these <b>bookmarks</b> in the form of metadata, so users may understand the content of the resource without first needing to download it for themselves. Such descriptions may be free text comments, votes in favor of or against its quality, or tags that collectively or collaboratively become a folksonomy. Folksonomy is also called social tagging, [...] "the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords to shared content".|$|R

5000|$|Software bugs {{present in}} some browsers {{are found to}} seriously degrade the {{security}} of the private mode. For example, in some earlier versions of Safari, the browser retained private browsing history records if the browser program was not closed normally (e.g., as a result of program crash), or if the user acted <b>to</b> <b>add</b> a <b>bookmark</b> within the private mode.|$|R

40|$|Social {{networks}} and collaborative tagging systems are rapidly gaining popularity {{as a primary}} means for storing and sharing data among friends, family, colleagues, or perfect strangers {{as long as they}} have common interests. del. icio. us is a social network where people store and share their personal bookmarks. Most importantly, users tag their bookmarks for ease of information dissemination and later look up. However, it is the friendship links, that make delicious a social network. They exist independently of the set of <b>bookmarks</b> that belong <b>to</b> the users and have no relation to the tags typically assigned <b>to</b> the <b>bookmarks.</b> <b>To</b> study the interaction among users, the strength of the existing links and their hidden meaning, we introduce implicit links in the network. These links connect only highly “similar” users. Here, similarity can reﬂect different aspects of the user’s proﬁle that makes her similar to any other user, such as number of shared bookmarks, or similarity of their tags clouds. We investigate the question whether friends have common interests, we gain additional insights on the strategies that users use to assign tags <b>to</b> their <b>bookmarks,</b> and we demonstrate that the graphs formed by implicit links have unique properties differing from binomial random graphs or random graphs with an expected power-law degree distribution...|$|R

40|$|ZuiScat is a {{visualization}} {{concept for}} querying large information spaces on Personal Digital Assistants (PDA). Retrieval {{results are presented}} in a dynamic scatterplot, which is enhanced by geometric and semantic zoom techniques to provide smooth transitions from abstract visual encodings to data content. The same visualization is also used <b>to</b> manage <b>bookmarks</b> and <b>to</b> serve as a powerful query history tool. User feedback suggests that ZuiScat provides intuitive and e#cient data access but still needs further improvement in terms of zoom usability and visual mapping...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This {{research}} {{investigates the}} utility of adopting a controlled vocabulary approach <b>to</b> <b>bookmark</b> management. An initial user survey conducted for this {{research has shown that}} just over half the population use <b>bookmarks</b> <b>to</b> save important websites and that 75 % of these people use up to three sub-levels only. The bookmark facility within all current web browsers is therefore underutilized and the argument that users need and want greater freedom and flexibility to create their own unique file structure is disputed. We conclude that users need a simple, logical and contextual system of bookmark management which complements their daily lives...|$|R
50|$|Xmarks {{provides}} an option <b>to</b> encrypt <b>bookmarks</b> {{while they are}} in transit between the browser and the Xmarks server. Individual users' bookmarks are kept private from other users. However, there are clearly issues of privacy and trust in sending <b>bookmarks</b> <b>to</b> a third party. Xmarks does provide an option for the user to avoid the Xmarks server, by using their own WebDAV or FTP server <b>to</b> store their <b>bookmarks,</b> but this option is only available with Firefox.|$|R
