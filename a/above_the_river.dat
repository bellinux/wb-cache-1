5|$|The Hermitage is a {{small stone}} shelter built {{into the side of}} the gorge, <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> It was {{designed}} by James Hamilton in the 1770s as a place for ladies to shelter while the men fished in the river.|$|E
5|$|In 1963 it was {{proposed}} {{to replace the}} bridge with a modern development containing seven floors of shops, office space, hotel rooms and leisure facilities supported <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> but the plans were abandoned because of costs. With the exception of alterations to the road layout and the balustrade, the design and appearance of the current bridge has remained almost unchanged since 1907. The bridge today {{is an important part}} of London's road system and carries the A202 road across the Thames.|$|E
5|$|St Briavels Castle {{is located}} on a spur {{dominating}} a position <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Wye, on {{the western edge of}} the Forest of Dean. The castle is predominantly built of local old red sandstone and limestone. The castle site is surrounded by an in-filled moat; now a garden, the moat was originally wet and fed by a spring underneath the moat itself.|$|E
50|$|The Fort Thompson Mounds are {{a series}} of low earthen mounds, {{extending}} from the eastern (downstream) end of <b>the</b> Missouri <b>River's</b> Big Bend, downriver along the eastern bank, past Fort Thompson and the Big Bend Dam. They are generally located on a terrace <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>river's</b> bottomlands, roughly 50 ft <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>river's</b> typical level in the early 1960s. All of these are believed to be burial mounds, which in some cases overlay older cultural materials.|$|R
50|$|The Enloe Dam, {{completed}} in 1920, is located just <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>river's</b> mouth. <b>The</b> <b>river,</b> after flowing over the dam, drops {{over what is}} left of Coyote Falls.|$|R
50|$|Spillimacheen Dam is a run-of-river dam on <b>the</b> Spillimacheen <b>River,</b> about 5 km <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>river's</b> {{confluence}} with <b>the</b> Columbia. The dam {{was built}} in 1955.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} known inhabitants {{from about}} 400 A.D. {{were members of}} the Hopewell tradition who buried their dead in mounds (now Indian Mounds Park) on the bluffs <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> The next known inhabitants were the Mdewakanton Dakota in the 17th century who fled their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake in central Minnesota in response to westward expansion of the Ojibwe nation. The Ojibwe would later occupy the north (east) bank of the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|The first {{church on}} {{this site was}} built in Saxon times, as the Port of Bristol first began. In medieval times, St. Mary Redcliffe, sitting on a red cliff <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Avon, was a sign to seafarers, who would pray in it at their departure, and give thanks there upon their return. The church was built and beautified by Bristol's wealthy merchants, who paid to have masses sung for their souls and {{many of whom are}} commemorated there.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, high <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> on a narrow ledge, ending {{at the foot of}} the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The {{original}} line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend. Nant Gwernol station, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on {{the site of}} the sidings.|$|E
50|$|Historian Arthur Weir Crouch {{reported}} several early fords along <b>the</b> Rocky <b>River,</b> {{most notably}} Brights Ford at <b>the</b> <b>river's</b> Laurel Creek confluence, and Hash Ford, or Indian Ford, near its mouth. A wooden bridge was {{built at the}} latter ford in the mid-19th century, but was destroyed by a flood in 1872. As part of its Great Falls Dam project, the Tennessee Electric Power Company built the Yost Bridge about a mile <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>river's</b> mouth in 1915, and the Blanks Bridge about three miles <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>river's</b> mouth in 1916. A bridge for Tennessee Highway 30 {{was built in the}} early 1920s.|$|R

5|$|During the British Iron Age {{the area}} became the southernmost {{territory}} of the Pennine tribe called the Brigantes. It is this tribe who in around 500 BC {{are thought to have}} constructed the hill fort that stands on the summit of a steep hill <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Don at Wincobank, in what is now northeastern Sheffield. Other Iron Age hill forts in the area are Carl Wark on Hathersage Moor to the southwest of Sheffield, and one at Scholes Wood, near Rotherham. The rivers Sheaf and Don may have formed the boundary between the {{territory of the}} Brigantes and that of a rival tribe called the Corieltauvi who inhabited a large area of the northeastern Midlands.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May 1848 a line opened between Irvine and Busbie, about 2miles (3km) north-west of Kilmarnock; a short {{branch to}} Irvine Harbour {{opened on the}} same day. The Cumnock line as far as Auchinleck and the Muirkirk branch from that point, opened on 9 August. This {{included}} the Ballochmyle Viaduct, located near Catrine; it was built with a central span of 181feet (55.2m) and 175feet (53.3m) high <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Ayr. It was the largest masonry arch span {{in the world at}} the time of its completion, and is the highest railway bridge in Britain.|$|E
5|$|On {{the steep}} grassy slopes <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Avon, Bristol rockcress (Arabis scabra) which {{is unique to}} the Avon Gorge can be seen {{flowering}} in April; orchids and western spiked speedwell (Veronica spicata) are common in June and July. In autumn the woodland hosts over 300 species of fungi. Bilberry, a scarce plant in the Bristol area, is found in Leigh Woods, as is the parasitic plant yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys). Lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) was discovered here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley; there is doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. Green-flowered Helleborine (Epipactis phyllanthes) is found {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge is}} one of only three {{existing}} public highway covered bridges remaining in Connecticut and one of two currently in service for motor vehicles. Automobile traffic is restricted to one lane, which has prevented a problem for pedestrians attempting to cross it. Despite its rarity, it has survived due to its ability to handle heavy loads and its sound construction. The presence of a cover helps solve the problem of the wooden bridge floor gradually deteriorating due to the weather, while its high crossing point <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> means it is less susceptible to erosion by spring freshets.|$|E
5|$|Timberlake's party left Long Island on November 28, 1761. The Holston River's unusually {{low water}} levels almost {{immediately}} stalled the journey, {{as the party}} was forced to drag their canoe over exposed shoals and sandbars. The party ran out of provisions after several days, but McCormack managed to shoot a bear, supplying them with several days' worth of meat. Around December 7, the party explored a stalactite-filled cave situated approximately 50 feet <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> Timberlake described an incident in which Sumter swam nearly a half-mile in the near-freezing river waters to retrieve their canoe, which had somehow drifted away while they were exploring the cave.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{upstream}} from Casper, the North Platte bends to the south. The original trail proceeded several {{miles along the}} river to Red Buttes, where {{a bend in the}} river formed a natural amphitheater dominated by red cliffs on the hill <b>above.</b> <b>The</b> <b>river</b> was easier to ford here for those who were unwilling or unable to pay to cross at one of the ferries downstream. This was the last good camp spot before leaving the river and entering the waterless stretch between the North Platte and the Sweetwater River. From here the settlers entered a difficult portion called Rock Avenue which moved from spring to spring across mostly alkaline soil and steep hills until it reached the Sweetwater River. Later settlers who had crossed to the northern side of the river at Casper would come to favor a route through a small valley called Emigrant Gap which headed directly to Rock Avenue, bypassing Red Buttes.|$|E
50|$|Funerary urns {{found in}} the late 19th century show that humans were in the area dating at the least to the Bronze Age, when people would have lived in pile {{dwelling}} settlements raised <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> and marshes.|$|R

5|$|Perched high <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Seine, an {{important}} transport route, {{the site of}} Château Gaillard, in the manor of Andeli, {{was identified as a}} naturally defensible position. In the valley below the site was the town of Grand Andely. Under the terms of the Treaty of Louviers (January 1196) between Richard and Philip II neither king was allowed to fortify the site; despite this, Richard intended to build a castle at Andeli. Its purpose was to protect the duchy of Normandy from Philip II—it helped fill a gap in the Norman defences left by the fall of Château de Gisors and above all Château de Gaillon, a castle which belonged to Philip and used as an advanced French fortification to block the Seine valley—and to act as a base from which Richard could launch his campaign to take back the Norman Vexin from French control. Indeed Les Andelys is located just in front of Gaillon {{on the other side of}} the Seine valley. Richard tried to obtain the manor through negotiation. Walter de Coutances, Archbishop of Rouen, was reluctant to sell the manor as it was one of the diocese's most profitable, and other lands belonging to the diocese had recently been damaged by war. When Philip besieged Aumale in northern Normandy, on the border with Picardy, Richard grew tired of waiting and seized the manor, although the act was opposed by the Church.|$|E
5|$|While all the cathedrals are impressive, some, {{because of}} their location, are highly {{significant}} landmarks and landscape elements. Among these is Chichester, which can be seen for many miles across a landscape of open fields {{and is the only}} one of England’s cathedrals that is visible from the sea. The grey spire of Norwich rises serenely from its surrounding city, to be a focus of the Norwich School of landscape painters. Ely, on a small hill, dominates the rural countryside and its appearance in times of flood causes it to be known as The Ship of the Fens. The three spires of Lichfield are known as The Ladies of the Vale. The “exquisite tower” of Worcester is seen best across the River Severn. Lincoln with its vast façade and three towers, the tallest being over 80 metres (270ft), rises majestically from a steep hill above the town. Salisbury Cathedral with its “faultless spire” constitutes one of the iconic views of England, made famous by the landscape painter John Constable. In the north of England, Durham makes a “spectacular” view as it sits dramatically on its steep rocky peninsula <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Wear, “half Church of God, half castle ‘gainst the Scots”.|$|E
5|$|Windsor Castle was {{originally}} built by William the Conqueror {{in the decade}} after the Norman conquest of 1066. William established a defensive ring of motte and bailey castles around London; each was a day's march– about – {{from the city and}} from the next castle, allowing for easy reinforcements in a crisis. Windsor Castle, one of this ring of fortifications, was strategically important because of its proximity to both the River Thames, a key medieval route into London, and Windsor Forest, a royal hunting preserve previously used by the Saxon kings. The nearby settlement of Clivore, or Clewer, was an old Saxon residence. The initial wooden castle consisted of a keep {{on the top of a}} man-made motte, or mound, protected by a small bailey wall, occupying a chalk inlier, or bluff, rising 100ft (30m) <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> A second wooden bailey was constructed to the east of the keep, forming the later Upper Ward. By the end of the century, another bailey had been constructed to the west, creating the basic shape of the modern castle. In design, Windsor most closely resembled Arundel Castle, another powerful early Norman fortification, but the double bailey design was also found at Rockingham and Alnwick Castle.|$|E
