James (who had printed Frank Comments), if {{he could}} borrow the {{printing}} blocks he used for photos, as they were too expensive for the fledgling company at the time. Harry also borrowed blocks from the Widnes Weekly News, Pantosphinx and local cinemas, but contributed to charities by printing free charity advertisements {{at the side of}} the front cover page. After taking Virginia home to Bowring Park in the evening, Harry would often return to the office and work throughout the night, pausing only to go to the Pier Head to buy a cup of tea and a hot pie <b>at</b> <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> Virginia's parents helped the paper during this time, as they paid for classified ads, and arranged for Harry and his future wife's first photographs together.|$|E
25|$|But whether {{complete}} or not, the Confutatio {{had little}} success; the attack {{attributed to the}} Jesuits was successful. Scioppius was wont to boast that his book had killed Scaliger. The Confutatio was Scaliger's last work. Five months after it appeared, on 21 January 1609, <b>at</b> <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> he died at Leiden {{in the arms of}} his son Heinsius. In his will Scaliger bequeathed his renowned collection of manuscripts and books (tous mes livres de langues étrangères, Hebraiques, Syriens, Arabiques, Ethiopiens) to Leiden University Library.|$|E

During his time at Northampton Town, Morison added to his qualifications with a National Diploma in Sports science, and also earned a coaching badge during his time at Protec. When Morison fell into part-time football with Bishop's Stortford in 2004, he worked for a shredding company, [...] "getting up <b>at</b> <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> shredding paper around London".

He quit the administration job immediately after signing for Stevenage in August 2006.|$|E
500|$|For the role, Bana shaved his head, gained thirty pounds, {{and spent}} two days with Read to perfect his mimicry. During filming he arrived on set <b>at</b> <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and spent five hours being covered in Read's {{trademark}} tattoos. In spite of the film's limited release outside of Australia, Bana's performance received positive reviews. American film critic Roger Ebert complimented Bana, stating that [...] "in a comedian named Eric Bana the filmmakers have found, I think, a future star ... He has a quality no acting school can teach you and few actors can match. You cannot look away from him". Chopper was a critical and financial success in Australia, and was nominated for Best Film at the Australian Film Institute Awards in 2001. Bana's performance won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor.|$|E
500|$|Class {{inequality}} in Swedish society {{was a strong}} and recurring theme in the Commission's findings. It appeared as a major motivator in the 289 personal narratives included in the report. These documents, of great research value and human interest today, were submitted by Swedes in Canada and the U.S. in response to requests in Swedish-American newspapers. The great majority of replies expressed enthusiasm for their new homeland and criticized conditions in Sweden. Bitter experiences of Swedish class snobbery still rankled after sometimes 40–50 years in America. Writers recalled the hard work, pitiful wages, and grim poverty {{of life in the}} Swedish countryside. One woman wrote from North Dakota of how in her Värmland home parish, she had had to earn her living in peasant households from the age of eight, starting work <b>at</b> <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and living on [...] "rotten herring and potatoes, served out in small amounts so that I would not eat myself sick". She could see [...] "no hope of saving anything in case of illness", but rather could see [...] "the poorhouse waiting for me in the distance". When she was seventeen, her emigrated brothers sent her a prepaid ticket to America, and [...] "the hour of freedom struck" ...|$|E

Yoav Bar was removed from his home <b>at</b> <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> by police and taken to the movement's club in the city. During a search of the premises, [...] " [...] security personnel destroyed the furniture, ripped pictures from the walls, walked on photos of the victims of the Israeli occupation, threw trash, cleaning chemicals, oil, and grease on piles of books and magazines that had been thrown on the floor, and wrote curses and obscenities on the walls. During this time, Yoav Bar was threatened and cursed; one officer told him, 'If it were up to me, I would shoot you in the head.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Trujillo's [...] "central arch" [...] was his {{instinct}} for power. This was {{coupled with an}} intense desire for money, which he recognized {{as a source of}} and support for power. Up <b>at</b> <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> he exercised, studied the newspaper, read many reports, and completed papers before breakfast. At the office by nine, he continued his work, and took lunch by noon. After a walk, he continued to work until 7:30 pm. After dinner, he attended functions, held discussions, or was driven around incognito in the city [...] "observing and remembering." [...] Until Santo Domingo's National Palace was built in 1947, he worked out of the Casas Reales, the colonial-era Viceregal center of administration. Today the building is a museum; on display are his desk and chair, along with a massive collection of arms and armor that he bought. He was methodical, punctual, secretive, and guarded; he had no true friends, only associates and acquaintances. For his associates, his actions towards them were unpredictable.|$|E

2500|$|On Monday 29 June, in {{a replay}} of the {{military}} raids on the Jesuit radio station in El Progreso of the 1960s and 1970s, the Jesuits' progressive radio broadcasts were abruptly pulled off the air <b>at</b> <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> On Sunday evening at 6pm, just {{an hour after the}} coup government's curfew began, a military contingent broke into Radio Progreso's headquarters. With guns pointed, they shouted: [...] "We’ve come to close down this piece of ****!" [...] One broadcaster locked himself in to keep broadcasting throughout the night. Shortly after, another military convoy stopped outside Radio Progreso. A group of soldiers approached the radio station’s guard and asked him if there were any people still working inside. When the guard said no, the soldier in charge told him: [...] "If we find someone inside, you will regret it." [...] And while the coup government, led by Roberto Micheletti, a native of El Progreso, threatened to shut down the station with violence, popular organisations resisting the undemocratic change in their government criticised the station for [...] "watering down" [...] its reporting of the tense and dynamic situation.|$|E
2500|$|... "Toward evening a {{party of}} hangmen arrived. The {{officers}} went in and informed the condemned men {{they were to be}} executed between four and five in the morning. Their reply was to sing [...] "Hatikvah" [...] and other songs in powerful voices.

We shouted back, 'Be strong! We are with you, and thousands of Jewish youth are with you in spirit.' They replied, 'Thanks,' and went on singing. At two a Sephardi rabbi whom we could not recognize from afar [...] was brought and stayed in the cell 15 minutes. <b>At</b> <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> Avshalom began singing [...] "Hatikva," [...] and we joined in loudly, pressing against the bars. At once armed police came up to the visitors' fence near our cell. At 4:03 Avshalom was hanged. At 4:25 we were shaken by the powerful singing of Meir. Hardly able to breathe, we nevertheless joined in. He was hanged at 4:28. At five o'clock the voice of Yaakov, this time alone, penetrated our cell, singing [...] "Hatikva." [...] Again we joined in. Two minutes later he was hanged.... At dawn we informed the prison officers through an Arab warder that we would not be responsible for the life of any Englishman who dared enter the jail yard. We declared a fast and prayed. Later in the morning we found the following inscription {{on the wall of the}} cell of the condemned: 'They will not frighten the Hebrew youth in the Homeland with their hangings. Thousands will follow in our footsteps.' Next to it was the Irgun insignia and their three names in the order they were executed." ...|$|E
