40|$|Introduction We are {{interested}} in the motion of a small particle in some regions of the Earth-Moon system. As a first model, we will use the spatial Restricted Three Body Problem (RTBP, see [5] for definition and main properties). It is well known that, in synodic coordinates, this model has five equilibrium points. We will focus on the one that is behind the Moon, usually called the L 2 point. Our purpose is to describe the dynamics in an extended neighbourhood of that point. This information is very useful to keep an spacecraft there, because we {{can take advantage of the}} natural dynamics of the problem. The main tools used are an effective computation of the <b>central</b> <b>manifold</b> of the point (to give a qualitative description of the dynamics) and a Lindstedt-Poincar'e method (to compute invariant tori inside the <b>central</b> <b>manifold).</b> This methodology has already been used in similar problems (see [1]). 2.

In Sect.  3, the direction and stability of Hopf bifurcation are determined by using normal form theory and <b>central</b> <b>manifold</b> theorem. Some numerical simulations are carried out to support our results in Sect.  4. Finally, a conclusion is given in Sect.  5.|$|R
40|$|The Oseledec {{splitting}} of the tangent space into covariant subspaces for a hyperbolic dynamical {{system is}} numerically accessible by computing the {{full set of}} covariant Lyapunov vectors. In this paper, the covariant Lyapunov vectors, the orthogonal Gram-Schmidt vectors, and the corresponding local (time-dependent) Lyapunov exponents, are analyzed for a planar system of rough hard disks (RHDS). These results are compared to respective results for a smooth-hard-disk system (SHDS). We find that {{the rotation of the}} disks deeply affects the Oseledec splitting and the structure of the tangent space. For both the smooth and rough hard disks, the stable, unstable and <b>central</b> <b>manifolds</b> are transverse to each other, although the minimal angle between the unstable and stable manifolds of the RHDS typically is very small. Both systems are hyperbolic. However, the <b>central</b> <b>manifold</b> is precisely orthogonal {{to the rest of the}} tangent space only for the smooth-particle case and not for the rough disks. We also demonstrate that the rotations destroy the Hamiltonian character for the rough-hard-disk system. Comment: 19 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{detailed}} multiscale {{analysis of a}} system of particles interacting through a dynamical network of links. Starting from a microscopic model, via the mean field limit, we formally derive coupled kinetic equations for the particle and link densities, following the approach of [Degond et al., M 3 AS, 2016]. Assuming that the process of remodelling the network is very fast, we simplify the description to a macroscopic model taking the form of single aggregation-diffusion equation for the density of particles. We analyze qualitatively this equation, addressing the stability of a homogeneous distribution of particles for a general potential. For the Hookean potential we obtain a precise condition for the phase transition, and, using the <b>central</b> <b>manifold</b> reduction, we characterize the type of bifurcation at the instability onset.

40|$|Inspired by {{an example}} of Grebogi et al [1], we study a class of model systems which exhibit the full two-step {{scenario}} for the nonautonomous Hopf bifurcation, as proposed by Arnold [2]. The specific structure of these models allows a rigorous and thorough analysis of the bifurcation pattern. In particular, we show {{the existence of an}} invariant 'generalised torus' splitting off a previously stable <b>central</b> <b>manifold</b> after the second bifurcation point. The scenario is described in two different settings. First, we consider deterministically forced models, which can be treated as continuous skew product systems on a compact product space. Secondly, we treat randomly forced systems, which lead to skew products over a measure-preserving base transformation. In the random case, a semiuniform ergodic theorem for random dynamical systems is required, {{to make up for the}} lack of compactness. Comment: 26 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

To achieve these goals, STAR-X requires a powerful X-ray telescope with a large field of view, large collecting area, and excellent point spread function.
