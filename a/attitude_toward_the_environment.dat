Additionally, children chose an environmental or nonenvironmental activity to engage in during each of three classroom educational sessions. Results indicated that children who possessed an internal locus of control had more positive scores on measures of environmental attitudes than did other children. This correlation suggests that children who feel they have control over and responsibility for their own actions and behaviors have strong pro-environmental attitudes.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of {{environmental}} education is to improve environmental literacy, including not just more knowledge but also a better <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> and a higher prevalence of pro-environmental behaviours. The Eco-School Program is considered the world largest environmental education program for schools, but it keeps growing without proof of its particular effectiveness in improving environmental literacy. This study compares the level of environmental literacy on Madeira Island (Portugal) among 9 th grade students from Eco-Schools and ordinary schools. It applies a questionnaire with three components, addressing knowledge, attitude and behaviour toward the environment. Results show that environmental literacy among 9 th grade EcoSchool students is not significantly higher than in ordinary schools. However, there are some features of environmental literacy that are slightly better in Eco-Schools, namely in knowledge, attitude and behaviours. Based on our findings, we conclude that the Eco-School Program {{is not really a}} better environmental education strategy than others strategies adopted in ordinary schools.

Therefore, people tend to avoid or diminish possible cognitive dissonance by making their thoughts, attitudes, and actions consistent.

These RTAs will help achieve sustainable development {{at the intersection of}} trade liberalization and ever-increasing environmental concerns. However, environmental provisions are not incorporated into all RTAs. For example, Japanese RTAs often incorporate environmental issues only in the preamble or relevant articles. As the first step in examining the environmental provisions in RTAs, this paper focuses on the RTAs that Japan has concluded with developing countries. The main characteristic of environmental provisions in Japanese RTAs is that there are very few relevant provisions. All Japanese RTAs has neither environmental chapters nor side agreements.

Studies examining determinants of farmers’ decisions to invest in land improvement technologies have focused on economic and financial factors, neglecting individuals’ perceptions and awareness of the problems and how they affect land use and behavioral change that enhance environmental sustainability. This study examines Haitian peasants’ environmental behavior structure using a structural equation modeling approach. Specifically, the study examines the effects of perceived susceptibility, seriousness, benefits, and barriers to change on attitude, and the causal effect of attitude on behavior. The influence of the level of resources extracted from the land per capita on perceptions, attitude, and behavior is examined. Results show that Haitian peasants’ attitudes toward the environment are significantly affected by their perceived susceptibility and severity of land degradation. The path coefficients linking perceived susceptibility, severity, and benefits to attitude are 0. 49 (t= 5. 43) and 0. 21 (t= 3. 78), respectively. A positive <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> seems to cause a greater inclination to behavioral change. The coefficient from attitude to behavior is 0. 21 (t= 3. 81).

A systems theoretical approach was followed in conjunction with a qualitative methodology in order to place the attitudes and perceived implications for quality of life in context with the systems in which they exist. The in-depth data that was collected by means of face-to-face interviews was analysed in a qualitative and systems theoretical framework. The three stages of analysis of the data are described and this culminates in a discussion of the six identified pattern categories. The conceptual discussion that follows are based on these six pattern categories. The participants' learned <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> the role of responsibility and its influence on perceived quality of life, risk perception as inhibitor of action, renewable energy and the perception of self, renewable energy as available medium and the possibility of change of attitude toward renewable energy sources are discussed in depth.

40|$|Funding {{for this}} project was {{provided}} by the Rhode Island Sea Grand Program under the Rhode Island Agricultural Experiment Station (contribution No. 3764) and the Norwegian Research Council, Oslo, Norway. In this research we chose to use contingent choice to determine consumers' preferences for ecolabeled seafood, and collect other data necessary to estimate the extent to which product attributes, consumer <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> and consumer demographics affect consumers' choices of ecolabeled seafood. In the remainder of this paper we next present the theoretical and econometric methodology used to determine consumer choice. That is followed by a discussion of the qualitative and empirical results. The final section summarizes the findings and presents implications of these results for the seafood industry, policy makers, and those organizations worldwide attempting to generate these ecolabeling programs...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} {{a limited amount of}} {{research}} on Black <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> Moreover, possible linkages between race, environmental attitudes, and perceptions about environmental health and justice have not been examined in the United States. This study contributes to this literature by assessing several of these linkages using data obtained from a survey of 247 residents living in or around a highly polluted community of color. It found that public perceptions about environmental health problems and environmental justice were significantly linked to race and public concern for local environmental problems. Blacks are more likely than Whites to believe they are being exposed to poorer environmental conditions, suffer more related health problems, and think that local public agencies and offi-cials have not dealt with environmental problems in their neighborhood in a just, equitable, and effective manner...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} for concern about <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> beyond one 2 ̆ 7 s neighborhood is still relatively poorly understood. This {{article examines the}} determinants of feelings of responsibility at a regional watershed level. Using demographic, attitudinal, self-reported behavior and neighborhood mapping measures from four cities in Australia, five hypotheses were derived. These were that wider environmental concerns would depend on (a) the physical and social characteristics of the respondents 2 ̆ 7 neighborhoods, (b) {{the size of their}} perceived neighborhoods, (c) the length of residence at their localities, (d) educational level and <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> environmental moral responsibility (and the interaction between them), and (e) the level of reported environmentally friendly behavior. Support was gained for all hypotheses except length of residence and the role of general moral <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> It is concluded that to explain community action at the regional level, it is important to include both spatial and psychological insights and methodologies in research...|$|R
