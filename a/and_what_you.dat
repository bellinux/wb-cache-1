500|$|In the {{interest}} of shortening the adaptation, approximately one-third of the story was eventually edited out; entire subplots and characters were removed. Before becoming a screenwriter Hetreed worked as an editor, and credits this experience for knowing [...] "... about structure <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> need to say <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can leave out. I am a big enthusiast for leaving things out." [...] She focused {{the story on the}} relationship between Griet and Vermeer, deciding what other storylines were [...] "... distracting and had to be jettisoned. Before editing, there was great stuff there, but Peter was fantastically ruthless." [...] Changes from the novel did not bother Chevalier, who felt that as a result the film gained [...] "... a focused, driven plot and a sumptuous visual feast." ...|$|E

You're talking about having a situation where whatever the action is or whatever the drama of the movie is, our first priority is to make sure it's rendered in the most realistic way we can get at." ...|$|E

But he understands the difference between what you say as a satirist <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do as a senator.

500|$|Israeli {{journalist}} Lily Galili attributed this {{to being}} {{in part due to}} an unwillingness to make land concessions for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

Who gives up territory in the first place! And in this small country. You must be kidding!'" [...] Russian-speaking Israeli analyst Igor Khlopitsky stated that this also resulted from the Russian-speaking Israelis generally wanting quick results during times of turmoil, saying, [...] "Those who came after Perestroika had the Soviet mentality beaten out of them by the very difficult problems of the time. And where some other Israelis see the possibilities for discussion and dialogue, they just want to solve the problems swiftly." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{of the two}} episodes {{occurred}} from September 24, 2014, until October 8, 2014. The Flashs {{episode was}} directed by Glen Winter, and Arrows by Jesse Warn. The fight scene between the Flash and Arrow in The Flash episode was shot over three nights. Because {{this was the first}} time Stephen Amell's character fought someone with superpowers, he had to change the way he performed stunts to accommodate the special effects. Comparing the filming of both series, Grant Gustin described The Flash shooting as [...] "really tedious," [...] working with [...] "a lot of plate shots that are empty shots of the area we are going to be in" [...] and later added in post-production, as opposed to Arrow where [...] "they shoot it from the perfect angles <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> see is what you get". Gustin also recalled at times it got confusing on set because they were shooting both episodes at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Rashad enjoyed {{working with}} both Cosby {{and the young}} cast, {{claiming}} that the actors very much became like a real family {{as early as the}} first episode, although her real-life relationship with the child actors more-so resembled that of friends as opposed to mother. Rashad said, [...] "I think Bill and I are great role models as far as our TV professions are concerned. Kids learn by example, and I think we're very good ones." [...] Second to Cosby himself, Rashad is the series' most regular cast member, appearing in a total of 212 episodes. In response to television personality Oprah Winfrey quoting a common critique of the series – [...] "How is it realistic to have a doctor and a lawyer in the same house?" [...] – Rashad defended, [...] "I grew up in Houston, Texas, in Third Ward, and it was very realistic. … I guess it just depends on who you know <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> know." ...|$|E

Ericksen explained, [...] "I didn't know anything about Mega Man, and [...] I said to the art director, 'What is he shooting with?' ... He said, 'Well, he must have a pistol, because I don't see a rifle.' ... I said, 'So, a pistol? Do {{you want me to}} do a pistol?' And he said, 'Yeah, let's put a pistol in there.'

500|$|In 1972, Gittings and Kameny {{organized}} {{a discussion with}} the American Psychiatric Association entitled [...] "Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue", where a panel of psychiatrists were to discuss homosexuality. When Gittings' partner Kay Tobin Lahusen noticed that all the psychiatrists were heterosexual, she protested. Gittings remembered, [...] "My partner, Kay, said, 'This isn't right—here you have two psychiatrists pitted against two gays, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> really need is someone who is both.' The panel moderator, Dr. Kent Robinson, agreed to add a gay psychiatrist if we could find one. In 1972 who would come forward? ... Kay and I wrote letters and made phone calls around the country." [...] A gay psychiatrist in Philadelphia finally agreed {{to appear on the}} panel in heavy disguise, and with a voice distorting microphone, calling himself [...] "Dr. H. Anonymous". He was [...] John E. Fryer, and he discussed how he was forced to be closeted while practicing psychiatry. Gittings read aloud letters from psychiatrists she had solicited who declined to appear for fear of professional ostracism. She described the event as [...] "transformative".|$|E
500|$|On May 1 at 1:22p.m., Panetta, {{acting on}} the president's orders, {{directed}} McRaven {{to move forward with}} the operation. Shortly after 3p.m., the president joined national security officials in the Situation Room to monitor the raid. They watched night-vision images taken from a Sentinel drone while Panetta, appearing {{in a corner of the}} screen from CIA headquarters, narrated what was happening. Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up in the Situation Room. In an adjoining office was the live drone feed presented on a laptop computer operated by Brigadier General Marshall Webb, assistant commander of JSOC. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of those in the Situation Room, and described it like this: [...] "Contrary to some news reports <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> see in the movies, we had no means to see what was happening inside the building itself. All we could do was wait for an update from the team on the ground. I looked at the President. He was calm. Rarely have I been prouder to serve by his side as I was that day." [...] Two other command centers monitored the raid from the Pentagon and the American embassy in Islamabad.|$|E

500|$|Idina Menzel, a Broadway veteran, {{was cast}} as Elsa. Menzel had {{formerly}} auditioned for Tangled, {{but did not}} get the part. However, Tangleds casting director, Jamie Sparer Roberts, preserved a recording of Menzel's performance on her iPhone, and on the basis of that, asked her to audition along with Bell for Frozen. Before they were officially cast, Menzel and Bell deeply impressed the directors and producers at an early table read; after reading the entire script out loud, they sang [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings" [...] together as a duet, since no music had been composed yet. Bell had suggested that idea when she visited Menzel at her California home to prepare together for the table read. The songwriters were also present for the table read; Anderson-Lopez said [...] "Lasseter was in heaven" [...] upon hearing Menzel and Bell sing in harmony, and from that moment forward, he insisted, [...] "Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel {{have to be in the}} movie!" [...] Lee said, [...] "They sung [...] it like sisters <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean to me nd there wasn't a dry eye in the house after they sang."

500|$|Reviews for The Boys from Baghdad High were {{generally}} favourable. The Huffington Post said that giving the video cameras {{to the students}} was an excellent idea because the depiction of their school-life versus the increasing danger was captured [...] "with neutral equality [...] that the film is able to capture the interiority of its subjects more acutely than a straight-forward examination of violence would". Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent said, [...] "its storyline was governed not by a tick-list of stock narrative dilemmas and secrets but the cruel uncertainties that occupation and insurgency have brought to Baghdad." [...] Time Out New York gave the film five out of five stars, and PopMatters rated it 8 out of 10. The Washington Posts Paul Farhi said, [...] "HBO has carved a niche as the TV home {{of some of the}} most compelling programs about the Iraq war ... Baghdad High does no harm to HBO's burgeoning war cred." [...] Variety, The Christian Science Monitor, LA Weekly, and the Los Angeles Times also praised the film. At the Question-and-Answer session following a screening at the Tribeca Film Festival, one audience member, a new recruit to the United States Marine Corps, told Ali, who had also attended, [...] "I finally know what life is like behind those walls <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> guys are like, and it's been really, really fantastic." ...|$|E
500|$|WME {{decided to}} price each market {{different}}ly, having {{a total of}} four different price points. In most markets each ticket would cost $62 (U.S.), while on bigger cities the tickets price were between $130 (US) to $140 (US). However, in minor cities the tickets were cheaper and its price points would not suffer great variations. One of the various points that was subject of attention was the decision to sell the front seats prior to the back ones. If that did not occur, it would mean that the front seats would be too expensive; The Moonshine Jungle Tour did not suffer from this problem. Unlike the prior tour, where Mars' live performances were circumscribed to theaters and ballrooms, in January 2012 it was settled that the concerts were scheduled to be in arenas. This decision was based upon his successful debut tour, not only for the amount of sold out concerts, but also due to his [...] "dynamic performances". John Marx, an associate and personal manager at the music division of WME, explained, regarding the previous decision, that [...] "analytics only give you so much...it has to do with what's in your gut <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think." [...] Since the beginning there were plans to schedule dates in United Kingdom and Europe, a leg of the tour that took around two months to be completed. Concerts were also scheduled in Australia and New Zealand for early 2014, as well as 40 stages in North America. In the end, more seats were added to venues due to overwhelmingly strong ticket sales. It was Mars' first world tour to not reach South America.|$|E
