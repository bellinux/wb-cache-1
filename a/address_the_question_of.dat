5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress {{was very careful}} to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority.

Finally, Kennedy was concerned that the court did not <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> the Equal Protection Clause.

5|$|Supporters of the emergentist {{coalition}} model argue that, as a hybrid, {{this model}} moves towards a more holistic explanation of word learning {{that is not}} captured by models with a singular focus. For instance, constraints theories typically argue that constraints/principles are available to children from the onset of word learning, but do not explain how children develop into expert speakers who are not limited by constraints. Additionally, some argue that domain-general perspectives do not fully <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> how children sort through numerous potential referents in order to correctly sort out meaning. Lastly, social pragmatic theories claim that social encounters guide word learning. Although these theories describe how children become more advanced word learners, they seem to tell us little about children's capacities {{at the start of}} word learning. According to its proponents, the emergentist coalion model incorporates constraints/principles, but argues for the development and change in these principles over time, while simultaneously taking into consideration social aspects of word learning alongside other cues, such as salience.|$|E
5|$|Heinlein {{draws an}} analogy between the human {{society in the}} novel, which is well-to-do but needs to be {{vigilant}} against the imperialist threat of the Arachnids, and U.S. society of the 1950s. Reviewers {{have suggested that the}} Arachnids are Heinlein's analogue for communists. Traits used to support this include the communal nature of the Arachnids, which makes them capable of a much higher degree of coordination than the humans. Bug society is once explicitly described as communist, and is moreover depicted as communist by nature; this has been read as implying that those with a different political ideology are analogous to alien beings. The related motifs of alien invasion, of being patriotic to one's people, and personal sacrifice during war, are present, as are other aspects of U.S. popular culture of the 1950s. Commentators have argued that Heinlein's portrayal of aliens, as well as being a reference to people in communist countries, invokes the trope of a return to the frontier. The concept of the frontier includes a social-Darwinist argument of constantly fighting for survival, even at the expense of indigenous people or, in the case of Starship Troopers, of aliens. Heinlein suggests that without territorial expansion involving violent conquest of other races, humans would be destroyed. Scholar Jamie King has stated that Heinlein does not <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> what the military government and Federal Service would do in peacetime, and argues that Heinlein has set up a society designed to be continuously at war, and to keep expanding its territory.|$|E

25|$|Marr's 2.5D sketch {{assumes that}} a depth map is constructed, {{and that this}} map {{is the basis of}} 3D shape perception. However, both {{stereoscopic}} and pictorial perception, as well as monocular viewing, make clear that the perception of 3D shape precedes, and does not rely on, the perception of the depth of points. It is not clear how a preliminary depth map could, in principle, be constructed, nor how this would <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> figure-ground organization, or grouping. The role of perceptual organizing constraints, overlooked by Marr, in the production of 3D shape percepts from binocularly-viewed 3D objects has been demonstrated empirically for the case of 3D wire objects, e.g. For a more detailed discussion, see Pizlo (2008).|$|E

25|$|After carbon, {{nitrogen}} {{is arguably}} the most important element needed for life. Thus, measurements of nitrate over the range of 0.1% to 5% are required to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> its occurrence and distribution. There is nitrogen (as N2) in the atmosphere at low levels, but this is not adequate to support nitrogen fixation for biological incorporation. Nitrogen in the form of nitrate could be a resource for human exploration both as a nutrient for plant growth and for use in chemical processes. On Earth, nitrates correlate with perchlorates in desert environments, and this may also be true on Mars. Nitrate is expected to be stable on Mars and to have formed by thermal shock from impact or volcanic plume lightning on ancient Mars.|$|E
25|$|The court later {{decided to}} <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> {{copyright}} infringement.

But that there are similarities in the design, structure and function of the two networks could equally derive from a conscious imitation of the other website without directly accessing and copying of the source code of Facebook. The reference to Facebook's web appearance could have simply happened by using the publicly available HTML texts and stylesheets when programming StudiVZ. Even if the programmer of StudiVZ was given the concrete task to create a website {{in the style of}} Facebook, this does not constitute copyright infringement according to German Copyright law, see §69a German Copyright Act Mere similarities between the two websites are not enough to demonstrate with sufficient probability a copying of the source code.|$|E
25|$|Pisanello's medal {{was created}} in {{response}} to John's visit to Italy. The emperor {{had been invited to}} attend the council in Ferrara by pope Eugenius IV to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> unifying the Latin and Greek churches. One of John's chief motivations for unification was to secure help from the western powers {{in order to meet the}} constant threat to his crumbling empire from the Turks. The emperor arrived in Venice in February 1438 where he was met by Niccolò III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara. Niccolò, with his sons Leonello and Borso, accompanied the emperor as they rode into Ferrara on the 4 March. Following its first magnificent opening public session on 9 April 1438, the Council was repeatedly postponed until the 8 October to allow the many different representatives of the European rulers to arrive.|$|E

25|$|The order {{sought by}} BHP was {{to prevent the}} Arbitration Court from {{enforcing}} the award, however the decision says nothing about who may enforce the award, in that section 44 permits any affected union member to enforce the award before any magistrate. The argument {{set out in the}} law report does not <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether prohibition was the appropriate remedy and none of the judges referred to the issue. The traditional supervisory writ to keep an inferior court within the bounds of its authority was the writ of certiorari by which the decision of the lower court is brought up and quashed. The constitution however omits certiorari from those powers contained in setting out the original jurisdiction of the High Court. In this way the High Court granted prohibition where certiorari would have been an appropriate remedy and extended the scope of prohibition beyond generally accepted limits.|$|E
25|$|At {{the systems}} level, the {{questions}} addressed in systems neuroscience include how neural circuits are formed and used anatomically and physiologically to produce {{functions such as}} reflexes, multisensory integration, motor coordination, circadian rhythms, emotional responses, learning, and memory. In other words, they address how these neural circuits function and the mechanisms through which behaviors are generated. For example, systems level analysis addresses questions concerning specific sensory and motor modalities: how does vision work? How do songbirds learn new songs and bats localize with ultrasound? How does the somatosensory system process tactile information? The related fields of neuroethology and neuropsychology <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> how neural substrates underlie specific animal and human behaviors. Neuroendocrinology and psychoneuroimmunology examine interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine and immune systems, respectively. Despite many advancements, the way networks of neurons perform complex cognitive processes and behaviors is still poorly understood.|$|E
25|$|Due to the Quebec Act of 1774, Michigan was governed {{during the}} Revolution {{as part of}} the Province of Quebec.
