25|$|The Springboks {{are said}} to have a notable {{advantage}} over touring sides when playing at high altitude on the Highveld. Games at Ellis Park, Loftus Versfeld, or Vodacom Park {{are said to}} present physical problems, and to influence a match {{in a number of other}} ways, such as the ball travelling further when kicked.

Being <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> rather than a physical location, Summerland is practically endless and {{takes the form of}} the inhabitants' wishes and desires. There is no pain or death, but people maintain occupations of sorts and perform leisure activities. The book depicts Summerland at length, through Chris's eyes. Chris feels somehow uneasy, haunted by nightmares ending in Ann's death. Soon he learns that Ann has killed herself.|$|E
25|$|Munch {{continued}} {{to employ a}} variety of brushstroke techniques and color palettes throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, {{as he struggled to}} define his style. His idiom {{continued to}} veer between naturalistic, as seen in Portrait of Hans Jæger, and impressionistic, as in Rue Lafayette. His Inger On the Beach (1889), which caused another storm of confusion and controversy, hints at the simplified forms, heavy outlines, sharp contrasts, and emotional content of his mature style to come. He began to carefully calculate his compositions to create tension and emotion. While stylistically influenced by the Post-Impressionists, what evolved was a subject matter which was symbolist in content, depicting <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> rather than an external reality. In 1889, Munch presented his first one-man show of nearly all his works to date. The recognition it received led to a two-year state scholarship to study in Paris under French painter Léon Bonnat.|$|E
500|$|The exact point made by Zhuangzi in {{this debate}} is not entirely clear.

500|$|The three {{sections}} {{of a typical}} session are the warm-up, the action, and the sharing.

[...] This is done through the use of different ice-breaker games and activities. [...] Next, the action section of the psychodrama session is the time in which the actual scenes themselves take place. [...] Finally, in the post-discussion, the different actors are able to comment on the action, coming from their personal point of view, not as a critique, [...] sharing their empathy and experiences with the protagonist of the scene.|$|E
500|$|Michelangelo was {{the artistic}} {{heir to the}} great 15th-century sculptors and {{painters}} of Florence. He learned his trade first {{under the direction of}} a masterly fresco painter, Domenico Ghirlandaio, known for two great fresco cycles in the Sassetti Chapel and Tornabuoni Chapel, and for his contribution to the cycle of paintings {{on the walls of the}} Sistine Chapel. As a student Michelangelo studied and drew from the works of the two most renowned Florentine fresco painters of the early Renaissance, Giotto and Masaccio. [...] Masaccio's figures of Adam and Eve being expelled from the Garden of Eden had a profound effect on the depiction of the nude in general, and in particular on the use of the nude figure to convey human emotion. Helen Gardner says that in the hands of Michelangelo [...] "the body is simply the manifestation of the soul, or of <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> and character".|$|E

500|$|Sir Lucious Left Foot was {{recorded}} {{over a period}} of three years, beginning on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in 2007. Big Boi has said that he [...] "always start working on albums on Martin Luther King Day. It's a good luck charm". The album was primarily recorded at Stankonia Recording Studio in Atlanta, Georgia, the studio used by OutKast for their previous albums. Additional recording took place at The Dungeon Recording Studios, The Slumdrum Dreamhouse, and King of Crunk in Atlanta, Dungeon East Studios in Decatur, Georgia, Instrumental Zoo in Miami, Florida, and Kush Studios in Palm Island, Florida. Big Boi discussed the Stankonia studio's environment in an interview for The Guardian, calling it [...] "comfortable but gritty enough to get you in <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> of being raw and ready to kill stuff", while noting that the sessions were accompanied by [...] "some candles, a little red light, maybe some crunk juice and a cigar; every now and then perhaps a little 'purple'". While searching for a new record label, he completed recording for the album. The album was mastered on May 27, 2010.|$|E
500|$|Another {{important}} {{theme in}} many of García Márquez's work is {{the setting of the}} village he calls Macondo. He uses his home town of Aracataca, Colombia as a cultural, historical and geographical reference to create this imaginary town, but the representation of the village is not limited to this specific area. García Márquez shares, [...] "Macondo {{is not so much a}} place as <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> which allows you to see what you want, and how you want to see it." [...] Even when his stories do not take place in Macondo, there is often still a consistent lack of specificity to the location. So while they are often set with [...] "a Caribbean coastline and an Andean hinterland... otherwise unspecified, in accordance with García Márquez's evident attempt to capture a more general regional myth rather than give a specific political analysis." [...] This fictional town has become well known in the literary world. As Stavans notes of Macondo, [...] "its geography and inhabitants constantly invoked by teachers, politicians, and tourist agents..." [...] makes it [...] "...hard to believe it is a sheer fabrication." [...] In Leaf Storm García Márquez depicts the realities of the Banana Boom in Macondo, which include a period of great wealth during the presence of the US companies and a period of depression upon the departure of the American banana companies. As well, One Hundred Years of Solitude takes place in Macondo and tells the complete history of the fictional town from its founding to its doom.|$|E
500|$|For Advent Children, Nomura {{agreed to}} direct the project largely because of his {{attachment}} {{to the character of}} Cloud. Although Nomura stated that Cloud was a more positive character in Final Fantasy VII than in Advent Children, he did not believe that such an [...] "'upbeat' image of him is what stuck {{in the minds of the}} fans", and the script was written to explain why Cloud returned to <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> [...] "consistent with the fans' view of him." [...] Nomura describes Cloud's life as peaceful but, hurt by the losses he experienced during the original game, one which he grew scared of losing. Blaming himself for things outside of his control, Cloud, Nomura elaborated, needed to overcome himself. In contrast to other heroes, who, in Nomura's view, typically possess character defects amounting only to quirks, Nomura believed Cloud's weakness to be humanizing. Nojima viewed the theme of the story as one of forgiveness, which he believed required hardship. Cloud, by taking up his sword and fighting, struggles to achieve it. Nojima sought to establish Cloud's withdrawn personality by depicting him with a cell phone, but never answering any calls. He originally intended for Aerith's name to be the last of those displayed while the backlog of ignored messages appears as Cloud's cell phone sinks into the water, but Nojima altered the scene because it [...] "sounded too creepy". The wolf which Cloud imagines [...] "represents the deepest part of Cloud's psyche" [...] and [...] "appears in response to some burden that Cloud is carrying deep in his heart", vanishing at the film's end. Nomura cites one of the film's final scenes, in which Cloud smiles, as his favorite, highlighting the lack of dialogue and Cloud's embarrassment. The scene influenced composer Nobuo Uematsu's score, who grew excited after coming across it in his review of the script, commenting on the difficulty players who had finished Final Fantasy VII would have had imagining Cloud's smile.|$|E

5000|$|Spiritual materialism is {{the belief}} that <b>a</b> certain {{temporary}} <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> is <b>a</b> refuge from suffering. An example would be using meditation practices to create <b>a</b> peaceful <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> or using drugs or alcohol to remain in a numbed out or <b>a</b> euphoric <b>state.</b> According to Trungpa, these states are temporary and merely heighten the suffering when they cease. So attempting to maintain <b>a</b> particular emotional <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> as <b>a</b> refuge from suffering, or constantly pursuing particular emotional <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> like being in love, will actually lead to more long term suffering.|$|R

[...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Cars made me want to hop in my jalopy and to head out to Route 66, bypassing the boring interstate highways that made the Mother Road redundant." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Though the central idea of nostalgia for a quieter, small-town life may well be lost on this movie's young audience -- Cars finds a pleasant and often sparkling groove." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "Cars might get us into car world as a gimmick, but it doesn't get us into car world as <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> Thus, the animation, rather than seeming like an expression of the movie's deeper truth, becomes an impediment to it." [...] Derek Adams of Time Out gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "There are many other brilliant scenes, some just as funny but there are just as many occasions where you feel the film's struggling to fire on all cylinders. Still, it's a Pixar film, right? And they're always worth a gander no matter what anyone says." ...|$|E
