5|$|In February 1991, Babić and Martić {{directed}} Serb paramilitaries to {{take over}} the town's police station and municipal buildings. On 1 March, the paramilitaries disarmed the town's 16 Croatian policemen and subjected local Croatian officials to a campaign of vilification <b>and</b> <b>intimidation.</b> The police in Pakrac were commanded by Jovo Vezmar, who sided with Babić and Martić.|$|E
5|$|Known {{initially}} as {{a kindly}} physician, Doc Ames led the city into corruption during four terms as mayor just before 1900. The gangster Kid Cann {{was famous for}} bribery <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> during the 1930s and 1940s. The city made dramatic changes to rectify discrimination as early as 1886 when Martha Ripley founded Maternity Hospital for both married and unmarried mothers.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1932, Himmler {{appointed}} Heydrich {{chief of}} the renamed security service—the Sicherheitsdienst (SD). Heydrich's counterintelligence service grew into an effective machine of terror <b>and</b> <b>intimidation.</b> With Hitler striving for absolute power in Germany, Himmler and Heydrich wished to control the political police forces of all 17 German states. They began with Bavaria. In 1933, Heydrich gathered some of his men from the SD and together they stormed police headquarters in Munich and took over the organisation using intimidation tactics. Himmler became the Munich police chief and Heydrich became the commander of Department IV, the political police.|$|E

The 2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary {{elections were}} held on 31 March and multiple claims of vote rigging, election fraud <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> {{were made by}} the MDC and Jonathan Moyo, calling for investigations into 32 of the 120 constituencies. Jonathan Moyo participated in the elections despite the allegations and won a seat as an independent member of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Republicans portrayed slavery as uncivilized {{and argued}} for {{abolition}} {{as a necessary}} step in national progress. Amendment supporters also argued that the slave system had negative effects on white people. These included the lower wages resulting from competition with forced labor, as well as repression of abolitionist whites in the South. Advocates said ending slavery would restore the First Amendment and other constitutional rights violated by censorship <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> in slave states.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades, however, did {{not succeed}} in persuading the satrap to ally with the Athenians, and, to hide this fact, demanded (claiming to be {{speaking}} for Tissaphernes) greater and greater concessions of them until they finally refused to comply. Disenchanted with Alcibiades but still determined to overthrow the democracy, Peisander and his companions returned to Samos, where the conspirators worked to secure their control over the army and encouraged a group of native Samian oligarchs to begin planning the overthrow of their own city's democracy. In Athens, meanwhile, a party of young oligarchic revolutionaries succeeded in gaining de facto control of the government through assassination <b>and</b> <b>intimidation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ho {{scheduled}} {{elections for}} December 23, {{but he made}} a deal with the VNQDD and the Dong Minh Hoi, which assured them of 50 and 20seats in the new national assembly respectively, regardless of the poll results. This only temporarily placated the VNQDD, which continued its skirmishes against the Vietminh. Eventually, Chinese pressure on the VNQDD and the Dong Minh Hoi saw them accept a coalition government, in which Tam served as foreign minister. For the communists' part, they accused the KMT of intimidating them into sharing power with the VNQDD, and claimed that VNQDD soldiers had tried to attack polling stations. The VNQDD claimed that the communists had engaged in vote fraud <b>and</b> <b>intimidation,</b> citing Vietminh claims that they had received tallies in excess of 80% in areas controlled by French troops.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1933 Adolf Hitler {{started a}} {{campaign}} of discrimination <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> against Jews, depriving them of their property and citizenship. Lasker and his wife Martha, who were both Jewish, were forced to leave Germany in the same year. After a short stay in England, in 1935 they were invited {{to live in the}} USSR by Nikolai Krylenko, the Commissar of Justice who was responsible for the Moscow show trials and, in his other capacity as Sports Minister, was an enthusiastic supporter of chess. In the USSR, Lasker renounced his German citizenship and received Soviet citizenship. He took permanent residence in Moscow, and was given a post at Moscow's Institute for Mathematics and a post of trainer of the USSR national team.|$|E
5|$|The 1872 gubernatorial {{election}} {{resulted in}} a narrow victory for Minstrel Elisha Baxter over Brindle Tail Joseph Brooks in an election marked by fraud <b>and</b> <b>intimidation.</b> Brooks challenged the result through legal means, initially without success, but Baxter alienated much of his base by re-enfranchising former Confederates and in 1874, Brooks was declared governor by a county judge who declared {{the results of the}} election to have been fraudulent. Brooks took control of the government by force, but Baxter refused to resign. Each side was supported by its own militia of several hundred Black men. Several bloody battles ensued between the two factions. Finally, President Ulysses S. Grant reluctantly intervened and supported Governor Baxter, bringing the affair to an end.|$|E

5|$|The Freedmen's Bureau {{enforced}} {{the amendment}} locally, providing {{a degree of}} support for people subject to the Black Codes. Reciprocally, the Thirteenth Amendment established the Bureau's legal basis to operate in Kentucky. The Civil Rights Act circumvented racism in local jurisdictions by allowing blacks access to the federal courts. The Enforcement Acts of 1870–1871 and the Civil Rights Act of 1875, in combating the violence <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> of white supremacy, were {{also part of the}} effort to end slave conditions for Southern blacks. However, the effect of these laws waned as political will diminished and the federal government lost authority in the South, particularly after the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in exchange for a Republican presidency.|$|E
5|$|The remark {{originates}} from {{an interview}} conducted by journalist Maureen Cleave, who included the statement in a March 1966 {{article for the}} London Evening Standard, which drew no public reaction at the time. When Datebook, a US teen magazine, quoted Lennon's comments five months later in August, extensive protests {{broke out in the}} Southern United States. Some radio stations stopped playing Beatles songs, their records were publicly burned, press conferences were cancelled, and threats were made. The controversy coincided with the group's US tour in August 1966, and Lennon and Brian Epstein attempted to quell the dispute at a series of press conferences. Some tour events experienced disruption <b>and</b> <b>intimidation,</b> including a picketing by the Ku Klux Klan.|$|E
5|$|Grant was {{vigorous}} in his {{enforcement of}} the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. He proactively used military and Justice Department enforcement of civil rights laws {{and the protection of}} African Americans more than any other 19th century president. He used his full powers to weaken the Ku Klux Klan, reducing violence <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> in the South. He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation. Grant's relationship with Charles Sumner, the leader in promoting civil rights, was shattered by the Senator's opposition to Grant's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty. Grant retaliated, firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant's reelection.|$|E

5|$|Lesser known {{than the}} Italian actions were the {{sabotage}} operations and limpet-mine attacks {{carried out by}} Spanish and Gibraltarian agents recruited in the Campo de Gibraltar by the Germans. The Abwehr contacted a Spanish staff officer from Campo de Gibraltar, Lieutenant Colonel Eleuterio Sánchez Rubio, a Spanish officer, member of the Falange and coordinator of the intelligence operations in the Campo, to establish a network of saboteurs with access to Gibraltar. Sánchez Rubio designated Emilio Plazas Tejera, {{also a member of}} Falange, as operations chief of the organisation. Most of the recruits for the sabotage operations were Spaniards from the Campo. A combination of financial reward, ideological commitment and some threats <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> were used to gather a significant number of agents. According to the British intelligence, there were at least 183 Spaniards and Gibraltarians involved in the espionage and sabotage operations against Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|Politically {{the city}} was {{dominated}} by the Republican Party, which had developed a strong political machine. The Republicans dominated the post-war elections, and corrupt officials {{made their way into}} the government and continued to control the city through voter fraud <b>and</b> <b>intimidation.</b> The Gas Trust was the hub of the city’s political machine. The trust controlled the gas company supplying lighting to the city. With the board under complete control by Republicans in 1865, they awarded contracts and perks for themselves and their cronies. Some government reform did occur during this time. The police department was reorganized; and volunteer fire companies were eliminated and were replaced by a paid fire department. A compulsory school act passed in 1895, and the Public School Reorganization Act freed the city's education from the political machine. Higher education changed as well. The University of Pennsylvania moved to West Philadelphia and reorganized to its modern form; and Temple University, Drexel University and the Free Library were founded.|$|E
5|$|The black {{nationalist}} movement in Southern Rhodesia, founded and organised by urban black elites {{during the late}} 1950s, was repeatedly banned by the colonial government because of the political violence, industrial sabotage <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> of potential black voters that characterised its campaign. The principal nationalist group, led by the Bulawayo trade unionist Joshua Nkomo, renamed itself with each post-ban reorganisation, and {{by the start of}} 1962 was called the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). Attempting to win black political support, Whitehead proposed a number of reforms to racially discriminatory legislation, including the Land Apportionment Act, and promised to implement these if his UFP won the next Southern Rhodesian election. But intimidation by ZAPU of prospective black voters impeded the UFP's efforts to win their support, and much of the white community saw Whitehead as too radical, and soft on what they saw as black extremism. In the December 1962 Southern Rhodesian election, the UFP was defeated by the Rhodesian Front (RF), a newly formed alliance of conservative voices headed by Winston Field and Ian Smith, in what was widely considered a shock result. Field became Prime Minister, with Smith as his deputy.|$|E

Prez has begun a new career as a mathematics teacher at the same school. The cold-blooded Marlo has come to dominate the streets of the west side, using murder <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> to make up for his weak-quality drugs and lack of business acumen. His enforcers Chris Partlow and Snoop conceal their numerous victims in abandoned and boarded-up row houses where the bodies will not be readily discovered. The disappearances of so many known criminals come to mystify both the major crimes unit investigating Marlo and the homicide unit assigned to solve the presumed murders. Marlo coerces Bodie into working under him.|$|E
5|$|The {{logistics}} of the referendum were organised and supervised by Diệm's brother and confidant, Nhu, {{who was the}} leader of the family's secret Cần Lao party, which supplied the Ngôs' electoral base. Reports of violence <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> were widespread. During the referendum, Nhu's staff told voters to throw away the green ballots. Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten, with pepper sauce and water sometimes being forced into their nostrils. The violations were particularly flagrant in central Vietnam, a region over which another of Diệm's younger brothers, Ngô Đình Cẩn, ruled. Cẩn was based in the former imperial capital city of Huế, home of the Nguyễn Dynasty and a source of support for Bảo Đại. He stifled this support by ordering the police to arrest 1,200 people for political reasons in the week leading up to the vote. In the city of Hội An, several people were killed in election violence {{on the day of the}} poll. Voting started at 07:00 and ended at 17:00.|$|E
5|$|The post-World War II Sabor {{developed}} from the National Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH), formed in 1943. In 1945, ZAVNOH transformed itself into the National Sabor of Croatia, preserving the continuity of Croatian sovereignty. After the war, the Communists ran unopposed in the 1945 elections; all opposition parties boycotted the elections due to coercion <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> by the OZNA secret police and the Communist Party, aimed at eliminating electoral dissent. Once in power, the Communists introduced a single-party political system, with the Communist Party of Yugoslavia as the ruling party and the Communist Party of Croatia as a branch party. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation. During Communist rule, the Sabor went from a unicameral parliament as specified by the 1947 constitution, to bicameral in 1953, changing again in 1963 {{to as many as}} five chambers, and then to three in 1974. The constitutional amendments of 1971 established the Presidency of the Sabor, and one of its functions became representing Croatia, as the Yugoslav constituent republics were essentially viewed as nation-states generally surrendering only their foreign and defence policies to the federation; the federal bodies were no longer independent of, but instead formed by, the republics.|$|E
