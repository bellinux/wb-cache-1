5|$|Work {{began on}} the canal in 1763. When water was let into {{the first section of}} the canal in 1764 the side walls of a lock chamber collapsed. Zacharie had to borrow money to continue. In 1766, to satisfy his creditors, he prematurely opened the canal. The water broke the banks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in the {{ceremony}} had to scramble to escape. Work was halted with the canal reaching only to Saint-Romain-en-Gier. In 1768, Zacharie died penniless of a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|Nora Belahcen Fitzgerald first {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} of creating an organization to help Morocco's underprivileged women through career training in 2006 after meeting a single mother begging on the street who lived on 2030 dirhams per day (about €2.70, $3.40 in 2006). Belahcen Fitzgerald was inspired by the Association Solidarité Féminine, which helps single mothers overcome poverty and social stigma by providing them with shelter, counselling, and vocational training. She decided to begin helping women by teaching them to make baked goods in her family's language center. This proved to be successful, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were able to make more money using their new skills than by begging. In 2008, Belahcen Fitzgerald began hiring underprivileged Moroccan women to cook for events she organized for her friends.|$|E
5|$|The TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal and {{the debut}} of the X Division TerrorDome were {{promoted}} as featured matches for the Sacrifice undercard. The TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal was announced by Cornette on the April24 episode of Impact!. The rules of the contest involved two stages: a standard battle royal in which competitors fought to eliminate wrestlers by throwing them over the top rope and a ladder match in which the final two wrestles fought to retrieve a contract that had been hung above the ring. An added stipulation to the bout was that the loser's head would be shaved and the winner would earn a TNA Women's Knockout Championship match. On the May8 episode of Impact!, Gail Kim won a Ten-Woman Clippers on a Pole match that granted her immunity from having her head shaven if she lost at the event. During the April24 episode of Impact!, TNA announced plans to introduce a new match type in the near future. The TerrorDome was announced on the May1 episode of Impact!, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were announced on the May8 episode. The participants were Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Consequences Creed, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Kaz, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt.|$|E

5|$|With {{effect from}} 1 September 2008, under the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) Order 2008 ("2008 PEMA Order"), {{responsibility}} for registering people wishing to speak or stage an exhibition or performance at Speakers' Corner {{was taken over}} from the police by the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation by way of {{an amendment to the}} Parks and Trees Regulations. To provide greater convenience, the National Parks Board made it possible for people to register online at its website. In addition, it became possible to hold demonstrations provided that they are organized by Singapore citizens <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> are only citizens and permanent residents. As the time period restriction was lifted, events can now be held around the clock. In addition, rules on voice amplification were revised to allow the use of self-powered amplification devices like loudhailers from 9:00a.m. to 10:30p.m. This relaxation of the rules potentially allows for speakers' messages to be heard by larger audiences. A minor change was also introduced to the conditions for the use of Speakers' Corner – no banner, film, photograph, placard or poster containing any violent, lewd or obscene material may be displayed or exhibited whether before, during or after the event.|$|E

25|$|On the Filipino side, {{information}} regarding atrocities {{comes from the}} eyewitnesses <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> themselves. In his History of the Filipino People Teodoro Agoncillo writes that the Filipino troops could match and even exceed American brutality on some prisoners of war. Kicking, slapping, and spitting at faces were common. In some cases, ears and noses were cut off and salt applied to the wounds. In other cases, captives were buried alive. These atrocities occurred regardless of Aguinaldo's orders and circulars concerning the good treatment of prisoners.|$|E
25|$|In 1933 the Jewish mayor (Oberbürgermeister) Ludwig Landmann was {{replaced}} by NSDAP member Friedrich Krebs.

One by one, participants opened the envelopes, revealing the color of the feather. If it was green, contestant moved on to the next episode. Red feather meant elimination of the player. In the final episode of each season, one of the envelopes contained a black feather, which revealed the identity of the mole.|$|E
25|$|The Russians and the Japanese both contributed {{troops to}} the eight-member {{international}} force sent in 1900 to quell the Boxer Rebellion and to relieve the international legations under siege in the Chinese capital, Beijing. Russia had already sent 177,000 soldiers to Manchuria, nominally to protect its railways under construction. The troops of the Qing Empire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> of the Boxer Rebellion could do nothing against such a massive army and were ejected from Manchuria. After the Boxer Rebellion, 100,000 Russian soldiers were stationed in Manchuria. The Russian troops settled in and despite assurances they would vacate the area after the crisis, by 1903 the Russians had not established a timetable for withdrawal and had actually strengthened their position in Manchuria.|$|E
25|$|At a December 7, 2010, press briefing, Google {{announced}} the Chrome OS Pilot Program, a pilot experiment {{and the first}} Chromebook, the Cr-48 Chrome Notebook, a prototype, to test the Chrome OS operating system and modified hardware for it. The device had a minimal design and was all black, completely unbranded although it was made by Inventec, and had a rubberized coating. The device was named after Chromium-48, an unstable isotope of the metallic element Chromium, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were named Cr-48 Test Pilots. Google distributed about 60,000 Cr-48 Chrome Notebooks between December 2010 and March 2011 for free to participants and in return asked for feedback such as suggestions and bug reports. The Cr-48 was intended for testing only, not retail sales.|$|E
30|$|During the {{induction}} of the RHI, {{the fingers of}} <b>the</b> rubber hand <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hidden real hand were stroked with two identical paintbrushes for 5  min.

In contrast, in the asynchronous condition, {{the timing of the}} strokes applied to <b>the</b> rubber <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant’s</b> hand were asynchronous. As in the original study, synchronism (synchronous vs asynchronous) was a within-participant factor. An additional control procedure tested coldness sensations vis-a-vis <b>the</b> RHI <b>and</b> also with synchronism (synchronous vs asynchronous) as a within-participant factor. <b>The</b> disgustingness condition <b>and</b> <b>the</b> coldness condition were tested between two separate groups.|$|R

25|$|On April 20, 2016, it was {{announced}} that Alexander Hamilton would remain the primary face on the $10 bill, {{due in part to the}} sudden popularity of the first Treasury Secretary after the success of the musical Hamilton on Broadway. It was simultaneously announced that Harriet Tubman's likeness would appear on the $20 bill while Andrew Jackson would now appear on the reverse with the White House. The new design for the reverse of the bill will feature the heroes of the Women's Suffrage Movement, including Susan B. Anthony, Alice Paul, Sojourner Truth, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Lucretia Mott, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> of the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession who marched in favor of full voting rights for women in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The sambandham {{relationship}} was usually arranged by the karanavan but occasionally they would arise {{from a woman}} attracting {{a man in a}} temple, bathing pool or other public place. The first sambandham of a man was deemed to be momentous and his ability to engage in a large number of such relationships increased his reputation in his community. Sambandham relationships could be broken, due to differences between the spouses or because a karavanan forced it due to being pressured by a man of higher rank who desired to marry the woman. Marriage by sambandham was neither legally recognised nor binding. The relationship could end at will <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> could remarry without any ramifications. Attempts to regulate sambandham marriages by the Nayar Regulation Act of 1912 in Travancore and the Malabar Marriage Act of 1896 in British Malabar were not very successful.|$|E
25|$|The results {{indicated}} that when the decision is meaningful to the person deciding value, the likely rating is based {{on his or her}} attitudes (positive, neutral, or negative) towards the name and towards the painting in question. The participants also were asked to rate some of the objects twice and believed that, at session's end, they would receive two of the paintings they had positively rated. The {{results indicated}} a great increase in the positive attitude of the participant towards the liked pair of things, whilst also increasing the negative attitude towards the disliked pair of things. The double-ratings of pairs of things, towards which the rating participant had a neutral attitude, showed no changes during the rating period. Therefore, the existing attitudes of the participant were reinforced during the rating period, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> suffered cognitive dissonance when confronted by a liked-name paired with a disliked-painting.|$|E
50|$|A common psychophysical test of {{olfactory}} {{ability is}} the triangle test. In this test, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> is given three odors to smell.

25|$|From 2009 onwards, Wat Phra Dhammakaya {{expanded}} its temporary ordination program {{by making it}} nationwide. In this program, the participants were trained in thousands of temples spread over Thailand, but ordained simultaneously at Wat Phra Dhammakaya. Held {{in cooperation with the}} House of Representatives, the concept of the program was to reverse the trend of the number of monks in Thailand decreasing. The program was held twice a year, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> who decided to stay in the monkhood were encouraged to revive abandoned temples. In 2010, 10,685 monks joined the program. As part of the ordination programs, Wat Phra Dhammakaya started to organize pilgrimages passing important places in the life of Luang Pu Sodh. This was done through a procession by over a thousand monks through the areas of Central Thailand that were flooded before, while life-size images of Luang Pu Sodh were ceremonially brought to install in pilgrimage places. During the breaks between the walks, the monks spent their time meditating, chanting and making good wishes to those affected by the floods.|$|E
500|$|It was {{launched}} on 1 September 2000 as a [...] "free speech area" [...] where speaking events {{could be held}} without the need {{to apply for a}} licence under the Public Entertainments Act (Cap. 257, 1985 Rev. Ed.), now the [...] ("PEMA"). However, it was necessary for people to register their intention to speak at the venue with a police officer at the Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post any time within 30 days before the event, though there was no requirement for the police to be informed of the topic of the proposed speech. Other conditions imposed were that speeches had to take place between 7:00a.m. and 7:00p.m., and the use of sound amplification devices was prohibited. In 2002, exhibitions and performances were permitted to be held at Speakers' Corner. Conditions for the use of Speakers' Corner were further liberalized in 2008. Responsibility for registering people wishing to speak or stage an exhibition or performance was taken over by the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation, and online registration was introduced. It became possible to hold demonstrations provided they are organized by Singapore citizens <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> are only citizens and permanent residents.

40|$|International audienceSince human {{behavior}} and perception have evolved within the Earth's gravitational field, humans possess an internal model of gravity. Although gravity {{is known to}} influence the visual perception of moving objects, the evidence is less clear concerning the visual perception of static objects. We investigated whether a visual judgment of the stability of human body postures (static postures of a human standing on a platform <b>and</b> tilted in <b>the</b> roll plane) may also be influenced by gravity <b>and</b> by <b>the</b> <b>participant's</b> orientation. Pictures of human body postures were presented in different orientations with respect to gravity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant's</b> body. <b>The</b> <b>participant's</b> body was aligned to gravity (upright) or not (lying on one side). Participants performed stability judgments {{with respect to the}} platform, imagining that gravity operates in the direction indicated by the platform (that was or was not concordant with physical gravity). Such visual judgments were influenced by the picture's orientation with respect to physical gravity. When pictures were tilted by 90 degrees with respect to physical gravity, the human postures that were tilted toward physical gravity (down) were perceived as more unstable than similar postures tilted away from physical gravity (up). Stability judgments were also influenced by the picture's orientation with respect to <b>the</b> <b>participant's</b> body. This indicates that gravity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant's</b> body position may influence the visual perception of static objects...|$|R
