40|$|Background:There {{is a lack}} of {{data about}} the {{information}} preferences of patients <b>and</b> their <b>partners</b> after a myocardial infarction. Aim:This paper explores anxiety, depression, coping and the desire to be actively involved in care in relation to age, gender and education level in myocardial infarction patients <b>and</b> <b>partners.</b> Methods:One hundred <b>and</b> twenty-eight patients <b>and</b> their <b>partners</b> answered the Swedish version of the Krantz Health Opinion Survey, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Mastery Scale one year after the patient's myocardial infarction. Results:More active roles in decision-making during care were desired by females, younger patients <b>and</b> <b>partners,</b> <b>and</b> patients <b>and</b> <b>partners</b> with higher education levels. Female partners reported more anxiety than male <b>partners,</b> <b>and</b> female patients reported more depression than male patients. No differences between groups were detected in coping; overall coping was rated high. Conclusions:Secondary prevention should consist of person-centred support to both the patients <b>and</b> their <b>partners,</b> since factors such as age, gender and education level can influence information preferences during patient care...|$|R
