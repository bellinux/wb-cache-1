Meredith isn't running away, getting all dark and going to Cristina for help getting out of her marriage. She's staying and fighting." [...] While writing the episode, writers intended {{the theme of the}} episode to be [...] "exposure", but after the episode was filmed, realized it was [...] "ambition". Rater commented on this: [...] "Derek wants to be Chief; Meredith wants to do a procedure that she knows she isn’t ready for; Cristina wants Teddy to stay." [...] In the episode, Oh's character asked her fellow residents if they would choose love or surgery, if need be, with Stevens choosing love and Yang and Meredith choosing surgery. The Grey Anatomy staff offered the insight: [...] "When we were first discussing this story we had a knock down drag out fight in the writers' room – if you had to choose your love or your art, which would you choose? <b>And</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> came down on the Cristina side, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> came down on the Izzie side – that in the end love is all that matters." [...] At the conclusion of the episode, Karev ended his marriage to Stevens. Rater expressed that the writers decided to have the fictional couple break-up, because Stevens wasn't sick anymore, and Karev would not have left her when she was.|$|E

It had been {{reported}} {{that members of the}} Ugandan Parliament were looking to hold debate behind closed doors. National Youth MP Monica Amoding told The Observer that some MPs on the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee proposed the move because of the sensitive nature of the bill. [...] "This subject is very sensitive <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> fear that if it is discussed in public view, we will be persecuted for holding particular views," [...] Amoding said.|$|E
2500|$|Biblical {{references}} {{appear in}} several forms. Chapter VI cites the Book of Job, ii. 13); {{there is an}} allusion to the elder brother in the Parable of the Prodigal Son, and Margaret paraphrases the definition of charity ("that spirit which suffereth long and is kind and seeketh not her own") (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 15) from the First Epistle to the Corinthians. However, Gaskell cautions against misuse; Bessy Higgins reads the Apocalypse to cope with her condition and interprets the parable of Dives and Lazarus so simplistically that Margaret counters vigorously: [...] "It won't be division enough, in that awful day, {{that some of us}} have been beggars here, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have been rich—we shall not be judged by that poor accident, but by our faithful following of Christ" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 19). Margaret and John follow a path of conversion which leads to reconciliation, acknowledging their [...] "unworthiness" [...] (Pollard, 1967). Margaret, who has the longest way to go, is crushed by guilt from her lie and by shame from being debased in Thornton's eyes (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 39). Francis de Sales encourages her to seek [...] "the way of humility" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 41), despite Mr. Bell's attempts to minimise and rationalise her lie as told in a panic. Thornton, on the brink of ruin like Job, tries not to be outraged while his mother rebels against the injustice of his situation ("Not for you, John! God has seen fit to be very hard on you, very") and gives fervent thanks for the [...] "great blessing" [...] his existence gives her (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 50).|$|E

This notion was entertained by Edward Hine, although it is incorrect as the native Germans are actually to this day referenced as Allemanni in the Syriac language. The only link to the region of Germany by Assyria is the speculative expedition into that region by mythological Prince Trebeta who allegedly colonized what is today Trier, which is annunciated by the Archbishops of Trier in records known as the Gesta Treverorum.|$|R
