40|$|Haptotaxis is a {{mechanism}} proposed {{at the end}} of the 1960 s to explain cell motility. It describes cell movement induced by an adhesion gradient. In this work, we present evidence for self-induced haptotaxis using negatively charged giant vesicles interacting with positively charged supported lipid bilayers, which has not been previously described. Depending on the charge of the vesicle, we observed different behaviors. At low charge, no adhesion occurs. At high charge, the vesicle adheres but does not move. In a restricted range of intermediate charge densities, we found that the vesicle moves spontaneously with velocities of the order of a few micrometers per second over distances of > 100 μm. We show that a local lipid transfer between the giant vesicle and the supported lipid bilayer takes place during the <b>adhesion,</b> <b>breaking</b> the symmetry and inducing a lateral charge gradient. This charge gradient polarizes the giant vesicle and induces its motion. To explain our observations, we propose a scaling model that relates the adhesion energy to the velocity of vesicle motion and to the characteristic lipid transfer time. Our measurements indicate that the effective adhesion energy is strongly reduced by counterions, which are dynamically trapped between the vesicle and the supported bilayer...|$|R
40|$|Adhesions {{frequently}} occur after abdominal surgery. Many anti-adhesion {{products have}} been used in clinic. However, the evidences are short for surgeons to reasonably choose the suitable anti-adhesion produces in clinical practice. This study provided such evidence by comparing the efficiency of five products to prevent abdominal adhesion formation in a rat model. Fifty-six Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into seven groups: sham-operation group, adhesion group, and five product groups (n = 8). The abdomens of rats were opened. The injuries were created on abdominal wall and cecum in the adhesion and product groups. The wounds on abdominal wall and cecum of rats in the adhesion group were not treated before the abdomens were closed. The wounds on abdominal wall and cecum of rats in the product groups were covered with anti-adhesion product: polylactic acid (PLA) film, Seprafilm®, medical polyethylene glycol berberine liquid (PEG), medical sodium hyaluronate gel (HA), or medical chitosan (Chitosan). Fourteen days after surgery, the adhesions were evaluated by incidence, severity, adhesion area on abdominal wall and <b>adhesion</b> <b>breaking</b> strength. The application of PLA film and Seprafilm® significantly reduced the incidence, severity, <b>adhesion</b> area and <b>breaking</b> strength of cecum-abdomen adhesion (P 0. 05). The statistical significances in the incidence and severity of abdomen-adipose adhesion between adhesion group and the product groups were not achieved. However, Seprafilm® was more effective to reduce abdomen-adipose adhesion than PLA film. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} products tested in this study did not effectively reduce cecum-adipose adhesion. The application of PEG could result in abdomen-small intestine adhesion. Based on the results of this study, the preference order of anti-adhesion products used to reduce postsurgical intra-abdominal adhesion formation is Seprafilm > PLA >> HA > Chitosan > PEG...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} contact {{behaviour}} of simple fibrillar interfaces designed to mimic natural contact surfaces in lizards and insects. A simple model of bending and buckling of fibrils shows {{that such a}} structure can enhance compliance considerably. Contact experiments on poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) fibrils confirm the model predictions. Although buckling increases compliance, it also reduces <b>adhesion</b> by <b>breaking</b> contact between fibril ends and the substrate. Also, while slender fibrils are preferred {{from the viewpoint of}} enhanced compliance, their lateral collapse under the action of surface forces limits the aspect ratio achievable. We have developed a quantitative model to understand this phenomenon, which is shown to be in good agreement with experiments...|$|R
40|$|Background: Functional {{restoration}} is themajor concern after flexor tendon reconstruction in the hand. The {{purpose of}} the present study was to investigate the effects of modifying the surface of extrasynovial tendon autografts with carbodiimide-derivatized synovial fluid with gelatin (cd-SF-G) on functional outcomes of flexor tendon reconstruction using a caninemodel. Methods: The second and fifth flexor digitorum profundus tendons from eleven dogs were transected and repaired in zone II. The dogs then had six weeks of free activity leading to tendon rupture and scar formation (the repair-failure phase). In the reconstruction phase, two autologous peroneus longus tendons from each dog were harvested; one tendon was coated with cd-SF-G and the other, with saline solution, as a control. A non-weight-bearing rehabilitation protocol was followed for six weeks after reconstruction. The digits were then harvested and evaluations of function, adhesion status, gliding resistance, attachment strength, cell viability, and histology were performed. Results: The tendons coated with cd-SF-G demonstrated significantly lower values (mean and standard deviation) compared with the saline-solution group for work of flexion (0. 63 ± 0. 24 versus 1. 34 ± 0. 42 N-mm/deg), adhesion score (3. 5 ± 1. 6 versus 6. 1 ± 1. 3), proximal <b>adhesion</b> <b>breaking</b> force (8. 6 ± 3. 2 versus 20. 2 ± 10. 2 N), and gliding resistance (0. 26 ± 0. 08 versus 0. 46 ± 0. 22 N) (p 0. 05) in distal attachment-site strength (56. 9 ± 28. 4 versus 77. 2 ± 36. 2 N), stiffness (19 ± 7. 5 versus 24. 5 ± 14. 5 N/mm), and compressive modulus from indentation testing (4. 37 ± 1. 26 versus 3. 98 ± 1. 24 N/mm).

40|$|SummaryContact {{inhibition}} of locomotion (CIL) {{is the process}} through which cells move {{away from each other}} after cell-cell contact, and it contributes to malignant invasion and developmental migration. Various cell types exhibit CIL, whereas others remain in contact after collision and may form stable junctions. To investigate what determines this differential behavior, we study neural crest cells, a migratory stem cell population whose invasiveness has been likened to cancer metastasis. By comparing pre-migratory and migratory neural crest cells, we show that the switch from E- to N-cadherin during EMT is essential for acquisition of CIL behavior. Loss of E-cadherin leads to repolarization of protrusions, via p 120 and Rac 1, resulting in a redistribution of forces from intercellular tension to cell-matrix <b>adhesions,</b> which <b>break</b> down the cadherin junction. These data provide insight into the balance of physical forces that contributes to CIL in cells in vivo...|$|R

Permanent attachment depended on cryo- or laser-induced <b>adhesions</b> round the <b>break.</b> The procedure was initially successful in 79 patients. Ten retinas became detached again after the balloon was withdrawn and required a more permanent buckle. Sixty-nine retinas remained attached.

40|$|Our {{previous}} report proposed a gradual adhesion {{model for the}} interface of epoxy resin used as an electric insulator. The model {{can deal with the}} flow and gelling of epoxy resin but it cannot deal with the fracture of the interface. In order to solve the fracture problem, two new fracture models are proposed for the epoxy resin interface. 1) One model proposes that partial adhesion remains after the fracture of the interface of epoxy resin occurs. The calculated strain change using this model does not give good agreement with experimental values. 2) Another model proposes that partial adhesion remains after the shrinkage strain from the curing reaction is released by the fracture of the interface. The calculated strain change from this model gives good agreement with experimental values. These results indicate that the weak <b>adhesion</b> region <b>breaks</b> away when the fracture of the epoxy resin interface occurs. The temperature distribution of the epoxy resin during the curing reaction does not change with the fracture of the interface. The internal stress of the epoxy resin goes up with the adhesion and goes down with the fracture of the epoxy resin interface...|$|R
50|$|Kahn saw {{problems}} with the concrete reinforcement systems used in building construction {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century. The existing technique of construction of the time was using concrete with a plain straight steel in the center of a concrete beam. The steel in the concrete would slip if there was even the tiniest bit of room between the hardened concrete and the steel and it would <b>break</b> <b>adhesion.</b> The main reinforcing bar had plain steel beam members rigidly attached to it. This diagonal tension fractured the reinforcing bar beams since the adhesion was broken. This caused weakness in the concrete/steel reinforced beam and a failure that could cause catastrophic results. The problem was that the plain steel beam separated from the concrete causing a failure since the two materials were no longer working together for strength.|$|R
40|$|A {{great deal}} of the {{remarkable}} properties of plants lie in the complex nature of adhesion of cells which is unparalleled in modern materials science. The exact nature of the polymer network that results in this is still to be completely understood. A basic view of the plant cell wall has a cellulose microfibrillar network embedded in a highly crosslinked pectin matrix. It is suspected that it is these crosslinks that give rise to the adhesion between cells and it is the aim of this thesis to examine the molecular features responsible for inter cellular adhesion in plants and how these might vary within the cell and between cells. A variety of cell separation techniques were utilised including the development of a multi-step pectin extraction procedure and investigation into the use of enzymes to break specific linkages in order to effect cell separation. These experiments confirmed that crosslinks between pectic polymers were responsible for cell <b>adhesion</b> as <b>breaking</b> them resulted in separation. These experiments also showed that the mechanism responsible for cell adhesion differed between faces of the individual cell and also between different types of cell. The existence and potential role in cell adhesion for non-methyl esters was also investigated. From this work it was discovered that non-methyl intermolecular esters existed. Studies that combined enzyme treatment with tensile strength testing equipment at the Institute of Food Research, Norwich endeavoured to test the strength of cell-cell adhesion and these discovered that this varied according to the structure of the polysaccharides in the wall...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTransient {{capture of}} cells or model {{microspheres}} from flow over substrates sparsely coated with adhesive ligands has provided significant {{insight into the}} unbinding kinetics of leukocyte:endothelium adhesion complexes under external force. Whenever a cell is stopped by a point attachment, the full hydrodynamic load {{is applied to the}} adhesion site within an exceptionally short time—less than the reciprocal of the hydrodynamic shear rate (e. g., typically < 0. 01 s). The decay in numbers of cells or beads that remain attached to a surface {{has been used as a}} measure of the kinetics of molecular bond dissociation under constant force, revealing a modest increase in detachment rate at growing applied shear stresses. On the other hand, when detached under steady ramps of force with mechanical probes (e. g., the atomic force microscope and biomembrane force probe), P-selectin:PSGL- 1 <b>adhesion</b> bonds <b>break</b> at rates that increase enormously under rising force, yielding 100 -fold faster off rates at force levels comparable to high shear. The comparatively weak effect of force on tether survival in flow chamber experiments could be explained by a possible partition of the load amongst several bonds. However, a comprehensive understanding of the difference in kinetic behavior requires us to also inspect other factors affecting the dynamics of attachment-force buildup, such as the interfacial compliance of all linkages supporting the adhesion complex. Here, combining the mechanical properties of the leukocyte interface measured in probe tests with single-bond kinetics and the kinetics of cytoskeletal dissociation, we show that for the leukocyte adhesion complex P-selectin:PSGL- 1, a detailed adhesive dynamics simulation accurately reproduces the tethering behavior of cells observed in flow chambers. Surprisingly, a mixture of 10 % single bonds and 90 % dimeric bonds is sufficient to fully match the data of the P-selectin:PSGL- 1 experiments, with the calculated decay in fraction of attached cells still appearing exponential...|$|R
40|$|Background To {{explore new}} methods for {{intraoperative}} evaluation of tissue oxygenation, we evaluated {{the use of}} visible light spectroscopy {{as a predictor of}} anastomotic strength in an experimental model with ischemic murine colon anastomoses. Materials and methods. Male rats (n = 34) were divided into 2 groups (ischemia and nonischemia). In the ischemia group the arteries of the distal colon were ligated until tissue oxygen saturation (StO(2)) dropped below 55 %. A segment of the proximal part of the colon was resected until a well-perfused area was reached and an anastomosis was performed. In the nonischemia group, resection of a segment of descending colon and a colon anastomosis was performed. The animals were sacrificed on the 3 rd or 7 th postoperative d. The anastomosis was tested for bursting pressure and breaking strength. Results. After ligation of the relevant mesenteric arteries, StO(2) of the distal part of the colon decreased (54. 6 % SD 6. 4 % versus 71. 2 % SD 7. 4 %, P Conclusion. Ischemia can intraoperatively accurately be detected by visible light spectroscopy. Partially ischemic anastomoses showed more <b>adhesions</b> and diminished <b>breaking</b> strength in the early phase of healing, whereas bursting pressure was not affected. Low StO(2) of a distal colon anastomosis appeared to be a risk factor for anastomotic dehiscence at d 3 and beyond. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Investigation {{results are}} {{presented}} {{of the effect of}} main parameters of laser powder surfacing of the Si-Mo spheroidal cast iron with the nickel based powder on quality and shape of padding welds and portion of the substrate material in the padding weld. Design/methodology/approach: It was shown basing on investigation of the process of laser powder surfacing with the nickel based powder onto the spheroidal cast iron substrate that it is feasible to make high quality padding welds in the relatively wide range of parameters. Findings: Investigation results presented in the paper were carried out to determine quality of padding welds applied by laser powder surfacing with the nickel based powder onto the alloy spheroidal cast iron and especially to determine the padding welds adhesion to the substrate. Practical implications: It is possible to control the portion of the substrate material in the padding weld with high accuracy in a wide range from even a few per cent, by the relevant setting of the line energy of the laser beam and the powder feed rate. Originality/value: The developed implant test makes the qualitative and quantitative assessment possible of the adhesion of the padding weld to the substrate, Table 5, Figs. 7 to 11. All padding welds made within the range of the optimum welding parameters demonstrated very good <b>adhesion</b> and the <b>break,</b> depending on the nickel padding weld thickness, occurred in the fusion area or by pulling part of the padding weld out...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT SNARE and rab protein {{family members}} were {{originally}} identified in terminally dif-ferentiated cell types. These proteins are phylogene-tically conserved and while compelling evidence demonstrates their involvement in the secretory path-way, their exact function is debated. We recently identified SNARE protein family members in the sea urchin egg and provided evidence that rab 3 functions in the exocytosis of cortical granules. Here we tested the hypothesis that these same proteins might also be present throughout embryogenesis to mediate mem-brane fusion events. We provide evidence that the sea urchin possesses a low complexity of gene family members of syntaxin, VAMP, and rab 3 and that these proteins are not only present during development, but are enriched in regions of the embryo with active sec-retory roles. We found accumulation of each family member in the apical and basal aspects of cleaving blastomeres, indicative of bidirectional secretion into the extraembryonic environment and blastocoel. Ele-vated levels of syntaxin, VAMP, and rab 3 were {{also found in the}} mesodermally derived pigment cells that invade and move within the ectoderm. These cells likely rely on SNARE and rab proteins to enable mobility by mediating the secretion of enzymes that <b>break</b> <b>adhesion</b> to neighboring cells and the extracel-lular matrix. In addition, these secretory proteins are enriched in the gut following gastrulation. Thus, we conclude that VAMP, syntaxin, and rab 3 mediate a variety of secretory events that is important for deve-lopment. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 58 : 22 ± 29, 2001...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{succeed in}} micro {{assembly}} task, {{it is necessary}} to control the environment of the microrobotic stations. Notably, the feeding and the carrying of the microcomponents to assemble {{are one of the most}} important challenges. Indeed, micro-assembly processes require the placement and the orientation of small components of which shapes and dimensions can vary widely. Feeding systems are often dedicated to a particular kind of microcomponents, this is the reason why several feeders must be used in a micro-assembly process. Different approaches are used to feed microparts like pneumatic, magnetic and electric feeders. Other systems use the concept of ciliary micromotion, or ultrasonic feeder. These micro or meso-systems are conveyors or feeders but they are most of the time dedicated to particular components. Moreover at this scale, dynamics of the microworld makes it difficult to feed very small components because adhesion forces (surface forces) are predominant compared to gravitational forces so much so that the microparts stick to the feeder. We have proposed a system well adapted for high rate of production, for high accuracy and also for an easy reconfigurability to change the micro components to feed. The system that has been patented through the European Project EUPASS (Evolvable Ultraprecision Assembly SystemS) is based on a tape feeder associated with a reconfigurable intermediate matter. Another feeding and carrying solution better adapted to very small components has been proposed. It is based on the use of inertial forces and it is able to move micro-components with various shapes and sizes. Controlled mechanical vibrations are used in order to move the microparts by <b>breaking</b> <b>adhesion</b> forces and friction, and drive micro-objects with a high precision...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} when the pulmonary capillaries in anesthetized rabbits are exposed to a transmural pressure (Ptm) of approximately 40 mmHg, stress failure of the walls occurs with disruption of the capillary endothelium, alveolar epithelium, or sometimes all layers. The present {{study was designed to}} determine whether some of the ultrastructural changes are rapidly reversible when the capillary pressure is reduced. To test this, the Ptm was raised to 52. 5 cmH 2 O for 1 min of blood perfusion and then reduced to 12. 5 cmH 2 O for 3 min of saline-dextran perfusion, followed by intravascular fixation at the same pressure. In another group of animals, the pressure was elevated for 1 min of blood and 3 min of saline-dextran before being reduced. The results were compared with previous studies in which the capillary pressures were maintained elevated at 52. 5 cmH 2 O during the entire procedure. Control studies were also done at sustained low pressures. The results showed that the number of endothelial and epithelial breaks per millimeter and the total fraction area of the breaks were reduced when the pressure was lowered. For example, the number of endothelial breaks per millimeter decreased from 7. 1 +/- 2. 1 to 2. 4 +/- 0. 7, and the number of epithelial breaks per millimeter fell from 11. 4 +/- 3. 7 to 3. 4 +/- 0. 7. There was evidence that the breaks that closed were those that were initially small and were associated with an intact basement membrane. The results suggest that cells can move along their underlying matrix by rapid disengagement and reattachment of cell <b>adhesion</b> molecules, causing <b>breaks</b> to open or close within minutes.

40|$|The {{nature of}} {{automobile}} dynamics is complex. While {{they might not}} be aware of it, the driver of a vehicle is making many complex decisions producing a complex series of actions that effect the motion of the vehicle. Usually the driver can perform a sequence of actions which move the vehicle in a way in which the driver intends, however, occasionally all drivers find themselves having to correct the vehicle {{in a way that they}} did not expect. The problem here is in the control system and the high performance available in the vehicles that are driven on the roads. With the brake pedal linked directly to the force on the brake disks, the driver of the vehicle simply applies pressure that corresponds to the rate at which they intend to stop. At the limits of tyre <b>adhesion</b> this <b>breaks</b> down as more brake pressure fails the slow the vehicle quicker, and the vehicle actually takes longer to stop. To produce safer vehicles, car developers and manufacturers have developed anti-lock brakes and stability control systems. These state of the art systems monitor driver commands that inherently reflect their intention and the behaviour of the vehicle. When the vehicle behaves in a way that does not follow the driver's intent the system intervenes and selectively applies braking, limits engine power or changes other relevant parameters to assist the driver in retaining control of the vehicle. Systems such as these use mathematical models based on simplified assumptions of vehicle behaviour. Because of this they are built to be robust, commercially available systems fail to capitalise on the full performance potential of the vehicle. Since systems such as these become active in emergency situations, every small gain in performance can make up the difference between life and death. Neural networks, as emerging decision making tools offer another approach to the problem of modelling non-linear dynamic, multi variable vehicle physics. Neural networks use artificial intelligence to find relationships between inputs and outputs. These relationships are not assumed or based upon a simplified physical analysis, but are built based on the past experiences of the network. For automobile dynamic prediction a special vehicle 'Intelligent Car' was conceived, constructed and tested in real world driving conditions. Structured driving tests were carried out gathering sufficient data to train ant test the potential of neural networks for the application. The results from these tests represent some of the first outcomes from preliminary research in the 'Intelligent Car' Project. This study outlines the design and development of the University of Tasmania's Intelligent Car together with results from training various neural network models to predict its brake forces and comparison with measured values...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{evolution}} of residual stresses in three-dimensionally constrained epoxy resins is presented. Visual observation of crack formation in an epoxy resin cured isothermally in a thick-walled glass tube suggested the possibility of large residual stress formation in resins cured under three-dimensional constraint. A novel strain-gaged tube technique was developed to measure the internal stresses evolved during the cure of three-dimensionally constrained epoxy resins. ^ The stresses evolved during the cure of a typical epoxy/amine resin system developed as a result of restrained polymerization shrinkage and restrained thermal expansion. Hydrostatic tensile stresses as large as 12 MPa developed in the epoxy resin during isothermal cures due to post-gelation chemical shrinkage. Upon cooling from the reaction temperature, the thermal stress developed per degree of temperature change was large and remained nearly constant as the resin was cooled through its glass transition temperature. It was discovered that the residual stresses could be reduced by gelling the resin at a low temperature and then completing the cure by elevating the temperature using a slow temperature ramp. In addition to internal stress measurements, the bulk modulus and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio of the epoxy resin were calculated as a function of cure time. ^ The evolution of residual stress was also measured in rubber-toughened, reactive thermoplastic oligomer-modified, and particulate-filled epoxy resins subjected to three-dimensional constraints. The addition of reactive rubber and thermoplastic oligomers had a negligible effect on the development of stress in the epoxy resin. In the particulate-filled systems, the average stress in the composite was reduced by the addition of fillers, increasing the compressibility of the composite. ^ The principles related to the study of residual stress formation in three-dimensionally constrained epoxy resins were applied to an <b>adhesion</b> problem. The <b>breaking</b> strength of a highly constrained tubular joint bonded with epoxy resin was measured. The bond strength was improved by both the addition of a compressible filler to the epoxy adhesive and the modification of the cure schedule. ...|$|R
