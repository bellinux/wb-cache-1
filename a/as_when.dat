5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Every spring, the Institute holds a ceremony, known <b>as</b> <b>When</b> the Whistle Blows, {{to honor}} students, staff, and faculty who {{died during the}} {{previous}} year.

5|$|In 1910 Yeats {{thought his}} {{horoscope}} suggested {{a return to}} Olivia; he distanced himself from Maud and in June began to see Olivia more frequently.

A year later, Olivia introduced Yeats to Georgie Hyde-Lees, her 18-year-old step-niece and Dorothy's best friend, whom Yeats eventually married.|$|E
5|$|In chess a minor {{material}} advantage is important <b>as</b> <b>when</b> material gets exchanged, the relative advantage becomes larger. Because new pieces come in, {{there is no}} endgame play in bughouse and material is therefore less important.

5|$|In the 14th century, {{diplomatic}} contact continued {{between the}} Franks and the Mongols, until the Ilkhanate dissolved in the 1330s, and {{the ravages of}} the Black Death in Europe caused contact with the East to be severed. A few marital alliances between Christian rulers and the Mongols of the Golden Horde continued, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> the Byzantine emperor Andronicus II gave daughters in marriage to Toqto'a (d. 1312) and later to his successor Uzbek (1312–1341).|$|E

50|$|The illegitimate {{children}} of the Monarchs also bear the arms of Portugal, but defaced with special marks of distinction.

The corresponding defacing marks would be a bend dexter for natural children, a baton sinister for bastards, a bend sinister azur for adulterine, a bend sinister vert for incestuous and a bend sinister gules for sacrilegious children.|$|R

5|$|Note: Although {{the basic}} plot of Show Boat has always {{remained}} the same, {{over the years}} revisions and alterations {{were made by the}} creators, and over time by subsequent producers and directors.

Some have been made to reflect contemporary sensitivities toward race, gender and other social issues.|$|E
40|$|Qualitative {{interviews}} exploring gender dierences {{in perceptions}} {{of sexual harassment}} were conducted with 100 full-time St. Louis area employees. Women more than men reported that telling dirty/sexual jokes was a non-harassing behavior, qualified behaviors <b>as</b> harassing <b>when</b> they happened in the workplace, and considered behaviors <b>as</b> non-harassing <b>when</b> the man’s intentions were not harmful. Men more than women reported that requesting a date was a non-harassing behavior, qualified behaviors <b>as</b> harassing <b>when</b> the woman did not welcome the behavior, and considered behaviors <b>as</b> non-harassing <b>when</b> they did not violate workplace norms.

500|$|The verb ra-ndi 'throw', for instance, {{surfaces}} <b>as</b> la-ndi <b>when</b> inflected for third-person singular subjects (he/she/it), {{which are}} realised by invisible, or null morphemes. but <b>as</b> nga-ra-ndi <b>when</b> inflected for a first-person singular subject (I). When {{preceded by a}} syllable with a coda, the 'r' similarly moves to 'l', as in ngan-la-ndi 'he/she/it threw you'. In short, the retroflex approximant 'r' [...] is only realised <b>as</b> 'r' <b>when</b> it occurs between two vowels. Elsewhere, it becomes a lateral approximant 'l'.|$|R
5|$|One {{strategy}} is to minimise actual motion, <b>as</b> <b>when</b> predators such as tigers stalk prey by moving very slowly and stealthily. This strategy effectively avoids the need to camouflage motion.|$|E
5|$|Prey {{mobility}} {{could also}} explain the initial development of aposematic signaling. If prey have characteristics {{that make them}} more exposed to predators, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> some dendrobatids shifted from nocturnal to diurnal behavior, then they have more reason to develop aposematism. After the switch, the frogs had greater ecological opportunities, causing dietary specialization to arise. Thus, aposematism {{is not merely a}} signaling system, but a way for organisms to gain greater access to resources and increase their reproductive success.|$|E
5|$|Reversible pulpitis is {{characterized}} by short-lasting pain triggered by cold and sometimes heat. The symptoms of reversible pulpitis may disappear, either because the noxious stimulus is removed, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> dental decay is removed and a filling placed, or because new layers of dentin (tertiary dentin) have been produced inside the pulp chamber, insulating against the stimulus. Irreversible pulpitis causes spontaneous or lingering pain in response to cold.|$|E

5|$|Since Darwin's On the Origins of Certain Instincts (quoted above) in 1873, path {{integration}} {{has been}} shown to be important to navigation in animals including ants, rodents and birds. When vision (and hence the use of remembered landmarks) is not available, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> animals are navigating on a cloudy night, in the open ocean, or in relatively featureless areas such as sandy deserts, path integration must rely on idiothetic cues from within the body.|$|E
