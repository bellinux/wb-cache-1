5|$|Out of the {{hundreds}} of known Psittacosaurus specimens, only one has been described to possess any sort of pathology. The specimen in question, consisting of a complete adult skeleton and tentatively assigned to P. mongoliensis, was found in the lower beds of the Yixian Formation. There is no sign of a bone fracture, but very clear signs of an infection can be seen near the midpoint of the right fibula. The bone exhibits a large round pit, evidence of necrosis {{due to a lack of}} blood supply to the region. The pit is surrounded by a massive <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> along the lower third of the bone. This large amount of bone deposited around the injury indicates that the animal survived for quite a while despite the injury and subsequent infection. As psittacosaurids were bipedal animals, a similar injury to a weight bearing bone in the leg would most likely have been fatal. Unlike the femur and tibia, the fibula is not a weight-bearing bone, so this animal would still have been able to walk to some extent. The source of the injury remains unknown.|$|E

The objectives of this prospective clinical trial were to determine the volume changes associated with facial swelling following orthognathic surgery. Methods: Twelve subjects requiring orthognathic surgery were recruited for the study. Laser scanned images of the subjects were obtained under a reproducible, controlled environment with two laser-scanning devices assembled as a stereo pair. Three-dimensional laser scans were recorded over six time periods, as follows: T 1, presurgical scan; T 2, 1 day postoperatively; T 3, 1 week postoperatively; T 4, 1 month postoperatively; T 5, 3 months postoperatively; and T 6, 6 months postoperatively. Results: The results showed a clinical difference in the mean shell deviations between bimaxillary and single-jaw orthognathic surgery. Furthermore, {{the results suggest that}} the mean volume <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> was reduced by approximately 60 percent within the first month after surgery.

If large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> (> 10 %) occur in these reactor internals, significant swelling related embrittlement may occur. Although fast reactor {{studies indicate that}} swelling should be insignificant at PWR temperatures, the low dose rate conditions experienced by PWR components may possibly lead to significant swelling. To address these issues, JNC and ANL have collaborated to analyze swelling in 316 stainless steel, irradiated in the EBR-II reactor at temperatures from 376 - 444 C, at dose rates between 4. 9 x 10 {sup {minus} 8 } and 5. 8 x 10 {sup {minus} 7 } dpa/s, and to doses of 56 dpa. For these irradiation conditions, the swelling decreases markedly at temperatures less than approximately 386 C, with the extrapolated swelling at 100 dpa being around 3 %. For temperatures greater than 386 C, the swelling extrapolated to 100 dpa is around 9 %.

The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> can be inferred from the comparison of the wet and the dry thickness. The degree of swelling is also accessible by comparing the acoustic thickness (in the Sauerbrey sense) to the optical thickness as determined by, for example, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy or ellipsometry. Solvent contained in the film usually does contribute to the acoustic thickness (because it takes part in the movement), whereas it does not contribute to the optic thickness (because the electronic polarizability of a solvent molecule does not change when it is located inside a film). The difference in dry and wet mass is shown with QCM-D and MP-SPR for instance in protein adsorption on nanocellulose and in other soft materials.|$|E

40|$|When washed rat red {{cells are}} kept in 3 per cent sodium citrate at low {{temperatures}} (4 – 9 °C.), their resistance to osmotic hemolysis increases so that after several days they swell very little in hypotonic solutions (R = 0. 15 to zero) and do not hemolyze even in distilled water. In this and in other respects they behave {{as if they were}} gelated or paracrystalline. The paracrystalline state is reversible, disappearing when the cells are warmed and rapidly reappearing when they are cooled, and the resistance to hypotonic hemolysis is not due to the cells reaching equilibrium with their environment by losing so much K that the concentrations become equal inside and out. The concentration of K remains about 25 times as great inside the cell as outside it in a hypotonic medium of T = 0. 1, and the failure to swell and to hemolyze seems to be due to the activity of K in the interior of the paracrystalline cell approaching zero. The paracrystalline red cells are more resistant to saponin and digitonin hemolysis, and do not undergo the usual shape transformations, probably because they are too rigid. Hemolysis by saponin and similar lysins occurs without sphere formation, and after lysis is complete a granular debris is left behind. The paracrystalline cells show a diffuse birefringence with polarized light; on their being warmed, the birefringence disappears except at foci which are usually situated along the rim of the cell.

Three irrigation intervals (every 10, 20 and 30 days) allocated in the main plots and three levels of animal manure (5, 10 and 15 tons/ha) and two species of plantago in factorial arrangement were as sub plots.

Three quality characters namely <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> mucilage, <b>swelling</b> factor and swelling rate per gram mucilage were also measured.

In the present method, {{they are used to}} obtain quantitative indications of the energy released in explosions of the devices under test. A swell sleeve is basically a thick-walled, hollow metal cylinder threaded at one end to accept a threaded surface on a device to be tested (see Figure 1). Once the device has been tightly threaded in place in the swell sleeve, the device-and-swell-sleeve assembly is placed in a test fixture, then the device is detonated. After the explosion, the assembly is removed from the test fixture and placed in a coordinate-measuring machine for measurement of the diameter of the swell sleeve as a function of axial position. For each axial position, the original diameter of the sleeve is subtracted from the diameter of the sleeve as swollen by the explosion to obtain the diametral swelling as a function of axial position (see Figure 2).

The mean age of US-guided SGB and blind SGB groups was 61. 3 ± 5. 6 years and 59. 1 ± 4. 5 years. We performed two blockades at 7 -day intervals on the affected side of patients with CRPS.

Films were characterized by measuring protein and water content, <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> amino groups, <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the films in water, and mechanical properties such as tensile strength (sigma(max)) and strain at maximum stress (epsilon at (sigma(max)). The use of different ratios of EDC to COOH resulted in different tensile properties and different percentage <b>of</b> <b>swelling,</b> which was attributed {{to the degree of}} cross-linking in the film. At a ratio of EDC/NHS/COOH = 0. 5 / 0. 5 / 1, films had a water content of 10 - 11. 5 % and showed the highest sigma(max) (2. 8 +/- 0. 9 MPa), the lowest a at sigma(max) (142 +/- 67 %), and the lowest swelling (46 %) compared to sigma(max) = 1. 7 +/- 0. 4 MPa, epsilon at sigma(max) = 257 +/- 63 %, and swelling = 68 % for native gluten films.
