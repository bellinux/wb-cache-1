40|$|In {{this paper}} we present our recent work to develop phonemic and syllabic {{inventories}} for Castilian Spanish {{based on the}} C-ORAL-ROM corpus, a spontaneous spoken Spanish {{with varying degrees of}} naturalness and in different communicative contexts. These inventories have been developed by means of a phonemic and syllabic automatic transcriptor whose output has been assessed by manually reviewing most of the transcriptions. The inventories include absolute frequencies of occurrence of the different phones and syllables. These frequencies have been contrasted against an inventory extracted from a comparable textual corpus, finding evidence that the <b>available</b> <b>inventories,</b> based mainly on text, do not provide an accurate description of spontaneously spoken Castilian Spanish. 1...|$|R

40|$|Service Orientation is a {{paradigm}} for exposing business functions as reusable services and enabling business partners to discover those services on demand. Several service-oriented methodologies {{have been proposed}} in both academia and industry. Few methodologies, however, do provide concrete yet pragmatic support for developing software that is truly service-oriented, supporting service-specific aspects and challenges. As a consequence, the design of software services that are in-line with service aspects is left up to the prudence of the developers. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a methodology that incorporates essential ingredients of SOA during analysis and design. The methodology focuses service inventories while consciously addressing the perspectives of both service providers and service consumers. By supporting service-oriented reasoning, our methodology results in better reusable services, and the <b>available</b> <b>inventories</b> aid the development of service-oriented systems in a more cost-effective way. This {{is of the essence}} in cloud computing, which is a fast-spreading business model promising high ROI and cost savings...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} abundances in {{the atmosphere}} have been measured between January 1996 and December 2001 in the high Northern Hemisphere (HNH) (30 degrees- 90 degreesN) using two different approaches: total column amounts of CO retrieved from infrared solar spectra and CO mixing ratios measured in situ at ground-based stations. The data were averaged, and anomalies of the CO HNH burden (deviations of the total tropospheric mass between 30 degreesN and 90 degreesN from the mean seasonal profile, determined as the 5 year average) were analyzed. The anomalies obtained from in situ and total column data agree well and both show two maxima, {{by far the largest}} in October 1998 and a lower one in August 1996. A noticeable decrease of the positive 1998 summer anomaly with increasing height was found. A box model was applied, and anomalies in source rates were obtained under the assumption of insignificant interannual sink variations. In August 1998 the HNH emission anomaly was estimated to be 38 Tg month(- 1). The annual 1998 emission positive anomaly was 96 Tg yr(- 1). Nearly all excess CO may be attributed to the emissions from boreal forest fires. According to <b>available</b> <b>inventories,</b> biomass burning emits around 52 Tg yr(- 1) during the "normal'' years; therefore total biomass emissions in 1998 were as large as 148 Tg yr(- 1). In August 1998, CO contribution from the biomass burning was twice as large as that from fossil fuel combustion.

Each ToolBank increases the impact of its local charitable sector by lending tools to organizations {{for use in the}} fulfillment of their missions. The <b>available</b> <b>inventory</b> of a typical ToolBank includes tools for landscaping, carpentry, plumbing, masonry as well as power tools, ladders, wheelbarrows, and others. The Atlanta Community ToolBank is currently the largest ToolBank in existence, with nearly 200 tool types in its lending inventory. The <b>available</b> <b>inventory</b> of the Atlanta Community ToolBank can be found here. As of December 31, 2016, eight ToolBanks are currently lending tools in Atlanta GA, Baltimore MD, Charlotte NC, Cincinnati OH, Houston TX, Phoenix AZ, Portland OR, and Richmond VA, with the Chicago Community ToolBank projected to open in the summer of 2016. The national network of ToolBanks is administered by the parent organization ToolBank USA, which was founded in 2008 to replicate the impact of the Atlanta ToolBank in cities beyond Atlanta. In 2014, ToolBank USA launched ToolBank Disaster Services, a program to deliver tools to communities affected by disaster. ToolBanks loaned $5.8M worth of tools and equipment to charitable organizations in 2015.|$|E

40|$|We use {{concurrent}} morning peak {{observations of}} carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) to evaluate mobile emissions estimates for CO and NOx at Bogotá (Colombia), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Santiago (Chile) and São Paulo (Brazil).

These ratios are not captured by <b>available</b> <b>inventories.</b> Comparison among inventories suggests that major uncertainties are linked to inadequate emission factors for CO and inadequate activity data for NOx.

40|$|The most {{significant}} progress {{in recent years in}} online display advertising is {{what is known as the}} Real-Time Bidding (RTB) mechanism to buy and sell ads. RTB essentially facilitates buying an individual ad impression in real time while it is still being generated from a user's visit.

As such, RTB has fundamentally changed the landscape of digital marketing. Scientifically, the demand for automation, integration and optimisation in RTB also brings new research opportunities in information retrieval, data mining, machine learning and other related fields. In this monograph, an overview is given of the fundamental infrastructure, algorithms, and technical solutions of this new frontier of computational advertising.

While the other two stations retained similar formats with fewer shows, WGBO added a large number of infomercials, religious programs and other paid programs to its schedule, although it did hold on to some entertainment-based programs.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century, large changes in surface emissions of atmospheric chemical species have occurred. Previous inventories have been developed {{during the past few years}} which describe the changes in emissions, but they have focused either on gaseous species or on particles and their precursors. We have developed a new inventory of emissions, which covers the 1860 - 2005 period, and provides consistent emissions distributions of both gaseous species and aerosols. The species considered in our inventory are carbon dioxide (CO 2), tropospheric ozone precursors, i. e. carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and aerosols and their precursors, i. e. sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and black and organic carbon. Our inventory provides emissions from both anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions at the global scale, at a 1 x 1 degree spatial resolution. The methodologies we have used to construct the inventory are discussed, as well as the statistical data and emissions factors that have been used.
