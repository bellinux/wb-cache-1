5|$|Exclusive is {{consistently}} {{the most expensive}} trim for each market, with the biggest choice of engines and features. It is the only model to feature <b>a</b> <b>folding</b> front passenger seat, making the storage space into the whole interior of the car except the driver's seat. Extras for the trim include: tinted windows, rear parking sensors, automatic windscreen wipers, a leather and chrome interior, pollen filter, and dual-zone automatic climate control, which allows for two varying temperature settings simultaneously in the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Parker Brothers Inc. republished The Mansion of Happiness in its {{original}} form, with minor modification to game spaces. The game included the circular end space introduced by J. Bufford in the third edition. This sixth edition used <b>a</b> <b>folding</b> game board with a fabric and cardboard pocket on the back edge of the game board. The teetotum was made using a wood dowel and cardboard hexagon.|$|E
30|$|<b>A</b> <b>folded</b> {{singularity}} {{is classified}} as <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> node if the eigenvalues are real and have the same sign, <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> saddle if the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, or <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> focus if the eigenvalues are complex [22, 23, 25, 29]. For parameter values used in Figure 2, the system has <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> node (with negative eigenvalues) on L+ (FN, blue point, in Figure 2), and <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> focus on L-(not shown).|$|R
50|$|The {{vertical}} dimension of <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> {{can be described}} as an amplitude. The horizontal dimension of <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> can by described by wavelength and hinge line of <b>a</b> <b>fold.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> grows in three-dimension, amplitude, wavelength and the length of the hinge line will increase.|$|R
25|$|Finally, folds can have, but don't {{necessarily}} have <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> axis. <b>A</b> <b>fold</b> axis, “is the closest approximation to {{a straight line}} that when moved parallel to itself, generates {{the form of the}} fold.” (Davis and Reynolds, 1996 after Donath and Parker, 1964; Ramsay 1967). <b>A</b> <b>fold</b> that can be generated by <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> axis is called <b>a</b> cylindrical <b>fold.</b> This term has been broadened to include near-cylindrical folds. Often, the fold axis {{is the same as the}} hinge line.|$|R
5|$|In 1999 the {{organisation}} supplemented its equipment by importing arms from Croatia, including military explosive TM500, CZ Model 25 submachine guns, modified AK-47 assault rifles with <b>a</b> <b>folding</b> stock, and RPG-18 and RPG-22 rocket launchers but a July 2000 attempt to smuggle a second consignment of arms was foiled by Croatian police, who seized seven RPG-18s, AK-47 assault rifles, detonators, ammunition, and twenty packs of TM500.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, NASA {{contracted}} Emerson {{to build}} a knife for use on Space Shuttle missions and the International Space Station. Rather than design a new model from scratch, NASA chose an existing model which already met their specifications, with one additional design requirement. The model is <b>a</b> <b>folding</b> version of the Specwar knife that Emerson had designed for Timberline {{with the addition of}} a guthook cut into the tantō point of the blade with which astronauts could open their freeze dried food packages. The knife is not available for purchase outside of NASA.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{published}} in the United States by W. & S.B. Ives in Salem, Massachusetts on November 25, 1843. Their game was <b>a</b> <b>folding</b> game board with a cloth and cardboard pocket attached {{to the bottom of the}} game board along its edge. In the pocket were the rules, implements, and teetotum. Its teetotum was an ivory dowel sharpened to a point at the bottom end inserted in an octagonal ivory plate. This type of teetotum was referred to as a pin and plate teetotum.|$|E

5|$|Tapp is {{beginning}} to learn that these people all have a dark connection to him. He proceeds to {{the offices of the}} building and finds Oswald McGullicuty in the next Jigsaw trap. Jigsaw felt that Oswald was perverting his message, and so he was placed into <b>a</b> <b>Folding</b> Table Trap, which would snap his body in half if Tapp failed to save him. Tapp saves Oswald, but he is swiftly killed by a compacting metal slab before either have a chance to react.|$|E
5|$|The M249 is gas {{operated}} and air-cooled. It has a quick-change barrel, allowing the gunner to rapidly replace an overheated or jammed barrel. <b>A</b> <b>folding</b> bipod is attached {{near the front}} of the gun, though an M192 LGM tripod is available. It can be fed from both linked ammunition and STANAG magazines, like those used in the M16 and M4. This allows the SAW gunner to use a rifleman's magazines as an emergency source of ammunition in the event that he runs out of linked rounds.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{currently}} {{operates a}} modified version of the Apache Longbow; initially called the Westland WAH-64 Apache, it is designated the Apache AH1 by the British Army. Westland built 67 WAH-64 Apaches under license from Boeing, following a competition between the Eurocopter Tiger and the Apache for the British Army's new Attack Helicopter in 1995. Important deviations made by AgustaWestland from the U.S. Apache variants include changing to more powerful Rolls-Royce engines, and the addition of <b>a</b> <b>folding</b> blade assembly for use on naval ships.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{structured}} biopolymers such as proteins, one {{can define}} topology of <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> RNA molecule. This is often done based on arrangement of intra-chain contacts within <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> RNA, termed as circuit topology.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the 1970 ’s, Eliashberg {{proved that}} every smooth map between {{oriented}} surfaces is homotopic to <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> map. <b>A</b> <b>fold</b> map is <b>a</b> smooth map with only fold singularities. It {{is known that}} for <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> map between surfaces, the singular set is a 1 -dimensional submanifold in the source surface. In this paper, we {{determine the number of}} singular set components of fold maps between closed oriented surfaces. 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{main event}} was between Batista and JBL (managed by Orlando Jordan) for the World Heavyweight Championship. Jordan {{interfered}} {{by attempting to}} hit Batista with <b>a</b> <b>folding</b> chair, but Batista grabbed the chair from him. Batista then used the chair to hit Jordan and JBL, and JBL was declared the winner, via disqualification. In WWE, a title cannot be won by disqualification, but only by pinfall or submission (the normal scoring conditions in professional wrestling matches). As a result, Batista retained the title. After the match Batista gave JBL and Jordan a Batista Bomb.|$|E
5|$|Although Kawasaki's theorem {{completely}} {{describes the}} folding patterns that have flat-folded states, {{it does not}} describe the folding process needed to reach that state. For some folding patterns, {{it may be necessary}} to curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping the rest of the paper flat and only changing the dihedral angles at each fold. For rigid origami (a type of folding that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on <b>a</b> <b>folding</b> pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|E
5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on <b>a</b> <b>folding</b> leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E
50|$|Measurement of the {{intersection}} between <b>a</b> <b>fold's</b> axial plane and a surface on the fold {{will provide the}} <b>fold</b> plunge. If <b>a</b> foliation does not match the observed plunge of <b>a</b> <b>fold,</b> it is likely associated with a different deformation event.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>A</b> <b>folded</b> {{symplectic}} {{structure is}} a closed 2 -form which is nondegenerate except on a hypersurface, and whose restriction to that hypersurface has maximal rank. We show how a compact manifold equipped with <b>a</b> <b>folded</b> symplectic structure {{can sometimes be}} broken apart, or “unfolded”, into honest compact symplectic orbifolds. <b>A</b> <b>folded</b> symplectic structure induces a spin-c structure which is canonical (up to homotopy). We describe how the index of the spin-c Dirac operator behaves with respect to unfolding. 1...|$|R
5|$|During {{an episode}} of Raw after SummerSlam, Goldberg {{challenged}} Triple H to another match for the World Heavyweight Championship. This match {{took place at the}} Unforgiven pay-per-view on September 21, 2003 with a stipulation that, should he lose, Goldberg would retire from WWE. Goldberg defeated Triple H to become the new champion. After SummerSlam, Kurt Angle focused his attention on The Undertaker, whom he wrestled in a match for the WWE Championship during {{an episode of}} SmackDown! on September 4, 2003. During the match, Lesnar attacked both wrestlers with <b>a</b> <b>folding</b> chair, leading to an Iron Man match between Angle and Lesnar. Lesnar won five falls during the match, while Angle won four, and as a result Lesnar won the title.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 {{individual}} Navy SEALs from a West Coast {{team had}} been using personally purchased custom fixed-blade knives made by Southern California knifemaker Phill Hartsfield. Hartsfield's knives were hard ground from differentially heat-treated A2 tool steel and {{are known for their}} distinctive chisel-ground blades. More accurately, they are zero ground; that is, the edge has no secondary bevel, minimizing drag when used for cutting purposes. Emerson had long been impressed by the cutting ability of the chisel-ground edge and had asked Hartsfield's permission to incorporate it into his own folding knives, which Hartsfield granted. When the SEALs asked Hartsfield to make them <b>a</b> <b>folding</b> knife, he informed them that he did not make folding knives and referred them to Emerson.|$|E
5|$|In a {{preliminary}} match from the Raw brand, Kane faced Rob Van Dam in a No Disqualification match. Both wrestlers used a ladder {{to their advantage}} early in the match. After Kane used the ladder on Van Dam, he attempted to hit Van Dam with a flying clothesline. However, Van Dam {{moved out of the}} way and Kane landed on the arena barricade. Van Dam performed a variation of a rolling thunder on Kane using <b>a</b> <b>folding</b> chair. Following this, Van Dam attempted to hit Kane with a Van Daminator with a chair, but Kane rolled out of the ring to avoid the attack. Van Dam then attempted an aerial technique from inside the ring towards Kane, but Kane caught Van Dam in mid-air and executed a Tombstone Piledriver, after which he covered Van Dam for the pinfall.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We are {{concerned}} with variational properties of <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> energy for <b>a</b> unit, dilation-invariant gradient field (called a cluster) in the unit disk. We show that boundedness of <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> energy implies L 1 -compactness of clusters. We also show that <b>a</b> <b>fold</b> energy is L 1 -lower semicontinuous. We characterize absolute minimizers. We also give a sequence of stationary states and discuss its stability. Surprisingly, the stability depends upon q, the power of modulus of the jump discontinuities, {{in the definition of}} the fold energy. ...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Doofenshmirtz, {{inside his}} robot, traps Perry, {{offering}} him a deli platter thinking he has won; Perry, however, has him pour {{a large amount}} of pepper onto it, blowing it and causing the robot to sneeze. The two are sent flying and crashing through the record building, Perry using the PFT tape to latch himself safely on a flag pole in the resulting free fall, while Doofenshmirtz plummets to the ground, landing on top of a mattress placed on top of a parked truck. Unfortunately, the truck belongs to <b>a</b> <b>folding</b> mattress company and Doofenshmirtz is crushed by the mattress and then crushed by his own robot immediately afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the 1960s {{setting of}} The Secret Service, Derek Meddings and the {{technicians}} {{of the special}} effects department received few commissions for scale models of vehicles that appeared futuristic. This left Unwin's vintage Ford Model T, Gabriel, as their main project, in addition to rendering vehicles and settings common to the decade in miniature and producing the optical enlargement and miniaturisation effects for the character of Harding. Wag Evans manufactured a full-size and two miniature versions (the last of differing scales) of Gabriel, fitting the larger car with belt-driven electric motors, <b>a</b> <b>folding</b> roof, upholstered interior, and a remote control mechanism.|$|E
