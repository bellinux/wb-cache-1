In this research,dragon <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> was concentrated by using freeze concentration process. Concentrated <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> can be preserved longer than non concentrated <b>fruit</b> <b>juice.</b> Besides,due to its small capacity storage,concentrated <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> also can minimize the transportation cost to import or export it. Freeze concentration process was used because it eliminates water from the juice at temperature below the water’s freezing point,thus preserving the aromatic compound that originally contained in the <b>fruit</b> <b>juice.</b> In addition to research objective,two process parameters and its effect on the <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> final concentration were studied. The process parameters were stirring rate and cooling medium temperature. The apparatus used to done the freeze concentration process was crystallizer unit.

The <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> spent 12 hours in the crystallizer unit. During the time spent in the crystallizer unit,stirring rate and cooling medium temperature were varied in the range of (600, 800, 1000, 1200 and 1400) rpm and (- 6, - 8, - 10, - 12 and - 14) °C. To determine the best stirring rate,the temperature of the cooling medium in the crystallizer unit was constant at - 10 °C while the stirring rate of the <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> was varied. Then,the best stirring rate was used to determine the best cooling medium temperature. The dragon <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> initial concentration was standardized at 7 °Brix. After 12 hour spent in the crystallization unit,the concentration of the <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> increased. For the first study where the temperature of the cooling medium was remaining constant, the highest concentrated <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> was 17 °Brix.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{has become}} a worldwide health problem. Whether <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> is beneficial in glycemic control is still inconclusive. This study aimed to synthesize evidence from randomized controlled trials on <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> in relationship to glucose control and insulin sensitivity. METHODS: A strategic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (updated to March, 2014) was performed to retrieve the randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> on glucose control and insulin sensitivity. Study quality was assessed using the Jadad scale. Weighted mean differences were calculated for net changes in the levels of fasting glucose, fasting insulin, hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) using fixed- or random-effects model. Prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the potential heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twelve trials comprising a total of 412 subjects {{were included in the}} current meta-analysis. The numbers of these studies that reported the data on fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA 1 c and HOMA-IR were 12, 5, 3 and 3, respectively. <b>Fruit</b> <b>juice</b> consumption did not show a significant effect on fasting glucose and insulin concentrations. The net change was 0. 79 mg/dL (95 % CI: - 1. 44, 3. 02 mg/dL; P =  0. 49) for fasting glucose concentrations and - 0. 74 µIU/ml (95 % CI: - 2. 62, 1. 14 µIU/ml; P =  0. 44) for fasting insulin concentrations in the fixed-effects model. Subgroup analyses further suggested that the effect of <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> on fasting glucose concentrations was not influenced by population region, baseline glucose concentration, duration, type of <b>fruit</b> <b>juice,</b> glycemic index of <b>fruit</b> <b>juice,</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> nutrient constitution, total polyphenols dose and Jadad score. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed that <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> may have no overall effect on fasting glucose and insulin concentrations. More RCTs are warranted to further clarify the association between <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> and glycemic control...|$|R

The present {{study was conducted to}} determine the effect of Noni (Morinda citrifolia) <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> {{in drinking}} water on male broiler chicken performance. The study used 100 male broiler chicken at 3 days of age strain Platinum MB 202 produced by PT. Multi Breeder Adhirama Indonesia (Grup PT Jafpa Comfeed Indonesia) Bandar Lampung. The study was assigned into The Completely Randomized Design with 5 treatments and 4 replications. Chicken were housed in 20 unit colony cages in size 100 x 50 x 50 cm each. The treatments were level of noni <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> {{in drinking water}}; R 0 (control, chicken were not drunk noni <b>fruit</b> <b>juice),</b> R 1 (chicken drank water contained 2, 5 % noni <b>fruit</b> <b>juice),</b> R 2 (chicken drank water contained 5 % noni <b>fruit</b> <b>juice),</b> R 3 (chicken drank water contained 7, 5 % noni <b>fruit</b> <b>juice)</b> and R 4 (chicken drank water contained 10 % noni <b>fruit</b> <b>juice).</b> Chicken fed similar ration containing 23. 58 % crude protein and 3943 kkal/kg gross energy. The selected noni fruit were mature fruit or has color white yellowish. Ration and drinking water were offered ad libitum. During the experiment, chicken were vaccinated only by Vaccine ND on 4 days of age. Chicken were kept for 4 weeks. Parameters measured were feed consumption, drinking water consumption, body weight gain and feed conversion ratio. Collected data were analyzed by analysis of variance and significant effect on the parameters were tested by Duncan’s Multiple Range Test. Result of this study showed that there was not significant (P> 0, 05) effect noni <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> in drinking water on feed consumption, drinking water consumption, body weight gain and feed conversion ratio. It is concluded that noni <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> could be mixed into the drinking water of broiler chicken up to 10 %...|$|R

Durian is the fruit native of Indonesia, that contain carbohydrates and alcohol. The aims of this research were to study the influence of durian <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> to the absorption and elimination kinetics of paracetamol and to know the dose of durian <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> that influence the absorption and elimination kinetics of paracetamol. The study was conducted using 16 rats, divided into 4 groups (n= 4 per group). Each group was treated the following treatment : control paracetamol (paracetamol 9 mg/ 200 gBW), dose 1 group (paracetamol 9 mg/ 200 gBW and 0. 675 g/ 200 gBW of durian <b>fruit</b> <b>juice),</b> dose 2 group (paracetamol 9 mg/ 200 gBW and 1. 350 g/ 200 gBW of durian <b>fruit</b> <b>juice)</b> and dose 3 group (paracetamol 9 mg/ 200 gBW and 2. 700 g/ 200 gBW of durian <b>fruit</b> <b>juice).</b> Blood sampling is done from the vein of rat 2 ̆ 7 s tail at minutes 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360. The quantitation of paracetamol in plasma was determined by UV spectrophotometer at 243 nm. Result showed that durian <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> changed the absorption kinetics of paracetamol, durian <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> decreased Ka, Cpmaks and increased Tmaks parameter of paracetamol. Durian <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> also changed the elimination kinetics of paracetamol, its decreased Vd, Ke, Cl and increased the value of AUC and T 1 / 2 paracetamol.
