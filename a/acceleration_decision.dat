This research attempts to fill this gap considering four years of Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA) data relating to achievement in mathematics.

The results suggest that content acceleration is beneficial, especially for students with higher prior knowledge scores.

This research attempts to fill this gap by considering four years of data provided by the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA) relating to achievement in mathematics. Acceleration in this study means the completion of the Year 12 Mathematical Methods study during Year 11. The data constitutes experimental data for content acceleration and the results of students from schools without such acceleration programs provide the corresponding control data. However, the <b>acceleration</b> <b>decision</b> is not taken randomly by schools, so this data is only quasi-experimental in nature. The measures of mathematical achievement (Mathematical Methods and Specialist Mathematics study scores) are carefully audited, and are accepted as reliable and valid by the Victorian education system. Controlling for individual characteristics such as gender and prior knowledge, and allowing for moderation effects due to school sector (Government, Catholic and Independent) and school class setting (single-sex or coeducational), the effects of content acceleration are measured using multi-level modelling. This study examines the effects of acceleration on the VCE Mathematics study scores of students who completed both Mathematical Methods (Units 3 & 4) and Specialist Mathematics (Units 3 & 4) in Victoria, over a four-year period (2001 - 2004). On average this involved 5341 students from 341 schools in each year with 829 students included in a content accelerated program. The results suggest that content acceleration is beneficial, especially for students with higher prior knowledge scores. The quasi-experimental nature of the data means that a causal relationship between acceleration and students’ mathematical performance can be claimed. In particular, this study showed that the effect of acceleration on students’ Mathematical Methods (the Year 12 study taken in Year 11 by accelerated students) study score was not significant. However, the effect of acceleration on students’ Specialist Mathematics study scores was significant. Accelerated students performed, on average, 2. 7 points higher (on a 50 point scale) than equal ability age-peers who were not accelerated. Interestingly, for accelerated students who scored in the top 2 % for their General Achievement Test, in the mathematics, science and technology component, their Specialist Mathematics study scores were on average, almost 5 points higher (on a 50 point scale) than their equal ability age-peers. The statistical control of other factors means that these results can also be generalised to other states, other countries and, probably, to other subjects. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|In uncongested traffic situations, a merge is {{executed}} {{when the}} available gap is sufficiently large. However, in congested traffic, acceptable gaps for merging {{are often not}} readily available, and merging can involve more complex mechanisms. For example, the driver in the target lane may slow down and cooperate with the merging driver, or the merging driver may become impatient and decide to force in, and compel the lag driver in the target lane to slow down. Choices of the merging plan or tactic affect the gap acceptance and <b>acceleration</b> <b>decisions</b> of the driver. A driver who has decided to force in, for instance, is likely to accept smaller gaps and accelerate to facilitate the merge. The chosen tactic at any instant, however, is not distinctly observable from the vehicle trajectory. The model {{presented in this paper}} extends previous research in modeling the effect of merging plans in the lane-changing decisions by integrating the <b>acceleration</b> <b>decisions</b> of the driver with the gap acceptance decisions. A combined model for merging plan choice, gap acceptance, target gap selection, and <b>acceleration</b> <b>decisions</b> of drivers merging from the on-ramp is developed in that regard. Parameters of all components of the models are estimated jointly with detailed vehicle trajectory data collected from Interstate 80 in California. The inclusion of the target gap choice and acceleration behavior components has been supported by a validation case study in which the model has been implemented in MITSIMLab and validated against the observed aggregate traffic data collected from US- 101 in California.

40|$|The ICCG {{method is}} widely used to solve a sparse {{symmetric}} linear system which results from the finite element method. In order to improve the convergence property of the ICCG method, {{the introduction of the}} acceleration factor was proposed. The automatic <b>acceleration</b> factor <b>decision</b> method, using the incomplete Cholesky decomposition of a coefficient matrix, has been previously proposed. However, when employing the previously proposed automatic decision method, much more iterations of ICCG method are sometimes necessary, compared with using the optimum acceleration factor, which minimizes the number of ICCG iterations. In this paper, we propose a new <b>acceleration</b> factor <b>decision</b> method. The proposed method takes into account the condition number of the coefficient matrix. It is well known that the condition number represents the quality of the matrix, so the optimum acceleration factor should be decided to minimize the condition number of the coefficient matrix. However, the condition number of the coefficient matrix is not almost available due to requiring a large memory in computing. Therefore, we develop a new method using submatrix, that does not need a large memory. The procedure and demonstration of the proposed method are described in this paper...|$|R
40|$|In {{conditions}} of global economic instability {{the success of}} electromechanical enterprises depends {{on their ability to}} react quickly to challenges of external environment. In order to create background and conditions for this ability the given enterprises refer to manufacturing activity planning, using a probabilistic approach based on forecasts that may not be true. The question of provision of more complete consideration of various internal and external factors and <b>acceleration</b> of <b>decision</b> making process and reaction to changing business environment arises before the organizations that concern more effective scheduling policy. International practice of solving such problems generally leads to qualitative discussion, whereas quantitative assessment of impact of control parameters of enterprise is not practically used, because there is no one systematic approach to manufacturing activity planning. On the basis of studying of international practices methodical guidelines of scenario approach to manufacturing activity planning with mathematical modeling of economics of producer price on electromechanical enterprises have been developed, which reasonably could be used with reference to and interaction with enterprise manufacturing program. The described approach allows solving planning problems iteratively in real-time mode concerning profit maximization, to form producer prices, to divide overhead costs according to the type of products and carry out cost accounting according to the type of a product, and it will provide functional interaction between factors and performance indicators...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRay tracing is a {{well known}} {{algorithm}} for the generation of realistic synthesis images. It is also applied in the acoustic domain. The computational cost of the full 3 D algorithm was previously an obstacle leading to approximations like the 2 D 1 / 2 ray tracing. Despite {{the fact that this}} method significantly reduces the needed computations, it also limits the realism of the approach. This article proposes a study of the 3 D ray tracing algorithm in the acoustic context. It presents several methods which can be used to reduce the computation time using different <b>acceleration</b> structures. Design <b>decisions</b> and optimisations made on the general ray tracing engine are explained. Then the choice of the acceleration structure and the propagation methods to use is clarified.

First, it should be clarified whether there is a direct benefit of the use of PET/CT or an indirect benefit because of improved diagnostic accuracy. If there is an indirect benefit, then decision modeling should be used initially to assess the benefit expected from the use of PET/CT. Only if decision modeling does not allow definitive conclusions should random-ized controlled trials be planned...|$|R

40|$|The {{vestibular}} system, which detects {{motion and}} {{orientation of the}} head in space, {{is known to be}} important in controlling gaze to stabilize vision, to ensure postural stability and to provide our sense of self-motion. While the brain's computations underlying these functions are extensively studied, the role of the vestibular system in higher level sensorimotor functions is less clear. This review covers new research on the vestibular influence on perceptual judgments, motor decisions, and the ability to learn multiple motor actions. Guided by concepts such as optimization, inference, estimation and control, we focus on how the brain determines causal relationships between memorized and visual representations in the updating of visual space, and how vestibular, visual and efferent motor information are integrated in the estimation of body motion. We also discuss evidence that these computations involve multiple coordinate representations, some of which can be probed in parietal cortex using neuronal oscillations derived from EEG. In addition, we describe work on decision making during self-motion, showing a clear modulation of bottom-up <b>acceleration</b> signals on <b>decisions</b> in the saccadic system. Finally, we consider the importance of vestibular signals as contextual cues in motor learning and recall. Taken together, these results emphasize the impact of vestibular information on high-level sensorimotor functions, and identify future directions for theoretical, behavioral, and neurophysiological investigations...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the areas of}} automated reasoning and first-order theorem proving paved the way to the developing of effective tools for the rigorous formal analysis of computer systems. Nowadays many formal verification frameworks are built over highly engineered tools (SMT-solvers) implementing decision procedures for quantifier- free fragments of theories of interest for (dis) proving properties of software or hardware products. The goal of this thesis is to go beyond the quantifier-free case and enable sound and effective solutions for the analysis of software systems requiring the usage of quantifiers. This is the case, for example, of software systems handling array variables, since meaningful properties about arrays (e. g., "the array is sorted") can be expressed only by exploiting quantification. The first contribution of this thesis is the definition of a new Lazy Abstraction with Interpolants framework in which arrays can be handled in a natural manner. We identify a fragment of the theory of arrays admitting quantifier-free interpolation and provide an effective quantifier-free interpolation algorithm. The combination of this result with an important preprocessing technique allows the generation of the required quantified formulae. Second, we prove that accelerations, i. e., transitive closures, of an interesting class of relations over arrays are definable in the theory of arrays via Exists-Forall-first order formulae. We further show that the theoretical importance of this result has a practical relevance: Once the (problematic) nested quantifiers are suitably handled, acceleration offers a precise (not over-approximated) alternative to abstraction solutions. Third, we present new decision procedures for quantified fragments of the theories of arrays. Our decision procedures are fully declarative, parametric in the theories describing the structure of the indexes and the elements of the arrays and orthogonal with respect to known results. Fourth, by leveraging our new results on <b>acceleration</b> and <b>decision</b> procedures, we show that the problem of checking the safety of an important class of programs with arrays is fully decidable. The thesis presents along with theoretical results practical engineering strategies for the effective implementation of a framework combining the aforementioned results: The declarative nature of our contributions allows for the definition of an integrated framework able to effectively check the safety of programs handling array variables while overcoming the individual limitations of the presented techniques...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT—People are {{impatient}} and discount future rewards more {{when they are}} asked to delay consumption than when they are offered the chance to accelerate consumption. The three experiments reported here provide a process-level account for this asymmetry, with implications for designing decision environments that promote less impulsivity. In Experiment 1, a thought-listing procedure showed that people decompose discount valuation into two queries. Whether one considers delayed or accelerated receipt of a gift certificate influences the order in which memory is queried to support immediate versus delayed consumption, and the order of queries affects the relative number of patient versus impatient thoughts. Relative frequency and clustering of impatient thoughts predicts discounting and mediates the discounting asymmetry. Experiment 2 implicated query order causally: When participants listed reasons for immediate versus delayed consumption in the order used spontaneously in <b>acceleration</b> and delay <b>decisions,</b> the discounting asymmetry was replicated; reversing the order in which reasons were listed eliminated the asymmetry. The results of Experiment 3, which used an implicit-memory task, support a memoryinterference account of the effect of query order. People’s willingness to trade immediate pleasure for later benefits determines whether they save adequately for retirement, imbibe too much alcohol, or reduce energy consumption to curb climate risks for future generations (Kirby & Herrnstein, 1995; Mischel, Grusec, & Masters, 1969; Weber, 2004, 2006). Choices between alternatives that differ in size and time to delivery (e. g., a $ 50 gift certificate today or a $ 100 gift certificate a year from today) are modeled by the discounted-utility model (Samuelson, Address correspondence to Elke U.

40|$|The Aliens Act 2000 {{aimed to}} speed up and improve {{decision-making}} in asylum cases. To what extent were these objectives attained {{and what can be}} said {{on the basis of the}} available data about the factors which determine the quality of asylum <b>decisions?</b> <b>Acceleration</b> of the asylum procedure has certainly been partly realized. However, this is not so much due to the Act as to shifts in emphasis in the decision-making process which are a result of the policy adopted by the Minister of Alien Affairs and Integration. These shifts were made possible partly by case law from the Administrative Division of the Council of State concerning the ‘RC criterion’. At the same time, the evaluation study of the operation of the Aliens Act 2000 showed that in a significant proportion of cases the processing time of asylum applications dealt with according to the normal procedure exceeds the legal time limit. In a large number of cases – up to almost 50 % for the cohorts submitting asylum applications in the last quarter of 2003 – the legal time limits are exceeded by six months. On the basis of the evaluation study conclusions can also be drawn about the quality of the decisions involved in asylum cases. It seems that initial decisions are of higher quality than they were under the previous Act and comparable in quality to the old decisions regarding objections. The percentage of judicial reversals is sometimes referred to as a measure for the quality of asylum decisions. While this percentage has been dropping in recent years, it should be borne in mind that this may be partly attributable to changes in the judicial review of asylum decisions. According to the Administrative Division, the Aliens Section should only marginally review the administrative body’s assessment of the facts in asylum cases, which is a radically different approach in comparison with the way the Aliens Section in the first instance used to see its task. The Administrative Division of the Council of State is in fact less critical of the quality of the IND’s work than the old Legal Uniformity Division. The result is that fewer asylum decisions are reversed and lawfulness has thus increased, although this does not necessarily mean that the legal quality of decision-making in asylum cases has risen. Doubts about this are borne out by the criticism of legal aid workers, human rights organizations, the Advisory Committee on Alien Affairs and the Evaluation Committee on the Aliens Act 2000 with regard to the settlement of asylum applications. ...|$|R
