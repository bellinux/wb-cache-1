5|$|Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) mind flashes back {{to being}} in the attic with his sister Samantha while their parents are arguing downstairs. Back in the present, Mulder awakens {{in a hotel room}} in Providence, Rhode Island, covered in blood. Mulder calls Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who arrives, finding him in shock. Mulder has <b>a</b> <b>pounding</b> {{headache}} and has no memory of what he has done in the past two days. Scully finds that two bullets have been fired from Mulder's gun and that he has keys belonging to a David and Amy Cassandra. Scully wants Mulder to check into a hospital, but he wants to find out if he was involved in a crime before doing so. The agents arrive at the Cassandra's house where the housekeeper tells them they are not at home. Mulder recognizes a house in many of Cassandra's paintings: a house that is near his parent's summer home in Rhode Island. When they arrive there, Mulder has striking pains in his head and flashes back again to when he was a child, seeing a younger version of The Smoking Man (Chris Owens) in his home. The agents enter the home, where they find the Cassandras dead from gunshot wounds.|$|E

The 7th and 8th Battalions of the PAVN 866th Regiment moved {{to support the}} attack. Four Type 59 tanks and PAVN {{artillery}} also fired support. Over the next two days, Task Force Delta took <b>a</b> <b>pounding</b> before it fell apart. A withdrawal across the flooding Nam Ngum (Ngum River) drowned many Hmong soldiers. Many others went missing. A B-52 friendly fire incident killed several GM 26 troopers, including their Forward Air Guide (FAG).|$|E
25|$|At the lap four restart, Vernay {{made ground}} up on Ericsson, {{and managed to}} {{slipstream}} past the All-Japan Formula Three champion on the run to Lisboa. Ricciardo tried a similar move on Bottas but could not manage to complete the pass, and such was his momentum loss, Vanthoor managed to slip through on the Australian into fifth position. Another Carlin driver in the wars was Hartley, as he clouted Coletti out of eighth position. Over the succeeding laps, Asmer's lap record from 2007 took <b>a</b> <b>pounding</b> as first Mortara and then Vernay took the lap record into the 2:10 bracket. However, any further progress for the record to fall was halted by a huge accident that befell Boyd on lap seven. Running in eleventh position, the young Ulsterman pulled out to pass his team-mate Mäki on the exit of the Mandarin, but clipped the car's left rear wheel at 170mph. Boyd's Dallara became airborne and was launched into a frightening aerial somersault, landing upside down before righting itself via a hit with the retaining wall. His car rebounded across the circuit, and was luckily avoided by {{every one of the}} cars around him on track. The crash meant the last three laps of the race were completed behind the safety car, and pulled in to allow the cars to pass across the line without overtaking. This allowed Vernay to win the race, securing pole position for the main race on Sunday. Ericsson was second ahead of Mortara– once he had returned the place back to the Swede– with Bottas, Vanthoor, Ricciardo, Bird, Iguchi, Merhi and Mäki completing the top ten. Outside the top ten were van der Zande, Kunimoto, Sims, García, Chilton, Cozzolino, Dusseldorp, Saga, Huertas, Zampieri, Bianchi and Coletti after their respective collisions, Imperatori, Hartley, McKenzie and Ho rounded out the 26 classified finishers.|$|E

[...] "Dante was the greatest guy at catching a ball in a crowd that I have ever seen," [...] Brown once said.

[...] Ted Kessler of NME wrote: [...] "Over <b>a</b> <b>pounding</b> garage tattoo Martin poses a deep, mortality-based teaser ('where {{do we go from}} here?'), asserts some self-belief ('God gave me style, God gave me grace') and then hits upon the bottom line as the song's mood suddenly improves with another fat and glorious chorus: 'Yeah, when you work it out I'm the same as you....your guess is as good as mine.'" ...|$|E

[...] This happens over <b>a</b> <b>pounding</b> beat laid down by Charlie Watts. After a few measures, Watts resumes playing his regular drum pattern.

500|$|The closing {{tropical}} house {{title track}} of Moog for Love was analyzed by a NME reviewer {{to borrow the}} rich sound that dominated Caracal while having the same tempo that was used for most tracks on Settle.

Instrumented with [...] "warbled" [...] synthesizers and <b>a</b> <b>pounding</b> bass drum, the song ends with a [...] "hypnotising" [...] sample of the track [...] "Moody's Mood", sung and recorded by Brian McKnight. [...] "Moody's Mood" [...] is a cover of what the EP and its title track is named after, [...] "Moody's Mood for Love". A song by Eddie Jefferson, its melody is derived from an improvised solo by jazz saxophonist James Moody. An a cappella group had written lyrics for the melody, and in the recording being sampled by the track, McKnight sings the melody and lyrics.

[...] "Westside Story" [...] contains an [...] "evil sounding piano plink", [...] "Dreams" [...] has a [...] "simultaneously smooth and eerie" [...] beat, and [...] "Hate It or Love It" [...] unveils a [...] "smoothed out R funk vibe". [...] "Higher" [...] revolves around <b>a</b> <b>pounding</b> synth blast and [...] "How We Do" [...] contains syncopated hand claps with a beat described as [...] "a hypnotic blast of sinister seduction powered by a deliciously primitive 808 pattern and a slinky synth." [...] "Don't Need Your Love" [...] samples Mary J. Blige's [...] "Not Gon Cry" [...] and is one the album's more soulful songs. [...] "Church for Thugs" [...] delivers a [...] "sing-song stylee over an accentuated sonic bed" [...] and [...] "Put You on the Game" [...] is a club track containing [...] "dark dirge of synth".|$|E
