Prior to eye opening, P 12 hamster pups were subjected to either bilateral eyelid suturing or dark rearing. On P 28 a subgroup of light deprived hamsters was returned to lighting conditions and the expression of NADPH-d activities in the retina was assessed. In hamsters reared in the 12 : 12 light-dark cycle, the number of NADPH-d <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) increased right after eye-opening and reached the adult level gradually. However, hamsters subjected to both bilateral eyelid suturing and dark rearing, the number of NADPH-d <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> in GCL was maintained at a low level but increased again upon returning to the 12 : 12 light-dark condition. In contrast, the number of NADPH-d expressing <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> in the inner nuclear layer (INL) remained low and unaltered regardless of the lighting environment. This study demonstrates that there are two subpopulations of NADPH-d expressing <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> with respect to different locations in the retina of hamsters.

The <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> study poses new and exciting components to the study of altering the chemical and mechanical properties of the non-spiking neural networks.|$|E
50|$|There are an {{abundance}} of neurons that propagate signals via action potentials and the mechanics of this particular kind of transmission is well understood. Spiking neurons exhibit action potentials {{as a result of}} a neuron characteristic known as membrane potential. Through studying these complex spiking networks in animals, a neuron that did not exhibit characteristic spiking behavior was discovered. These neurons use a graded potential to transmit data as they lack the membrane potential that spiking neurons possess. This method of transmission has a huge effect on the fidelity, strength, and lifetime of the signal. Non-spiking neurons were identified as a special kind of interneuron and function as an intermediary point of process for sensory-motor systems. Animals have become substantial models for understanding more about non-spiking neural networks and the role they play in an animal’s ability to process information and its overall function. Animal models indicate that the interneurons modulate directional and posture coordinating behaviors.Crustaceans and arthropods such as the crawfish have created many opportunities to learn about the modulatory role that these neurons have in addition to their potential to be modulated regardless of their lack of exhibiting spiking behavior. Most of the known information about nonspiking neurons is derived from animal models. Studies focus on neuromuscular junctions and modulation of abdominal motor cells. Modulatory interneurons are neurons that are physically situated next to muscle fibers and innervate the nerve fibers which allow for some orienting movement. These modulatory interneurons are usually nonspiking neurons. Advances in studying nonspiking neurons included determining new delineations among the different types of interneurons. These discoveries were due to the usage of methods such as protein receptor silencing. Studies have been done on the non-spiking neuron qualities in animals of specific non-spiking neural networks that have a corollary in humans, e.g. retina <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> of the eye.|$|E

To gain insight into mechanisms vital to the production and survival of <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> types, we investigated a group of mutations in three zebrafish loci: kleks (kle), chiorny (chy), and bergmann (bgm). Mutants of all three genes display a severe loss of selected <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> subpopulations. The numbers of GABA-expressing amacrine interneurons are sharply reduced in all three mutants, while cell loss in other <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> subpopulations varies and some cells are not affected at all. To investigate how <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> loss affects retinal function, we performed electroretinograms on mutant animals. While the kle mutation mostly influences the function of the inner nuclear layer, unexpectedly the chy mutant phenotype also involves a loss of photoreceptor cell activity. The precise ratios and arrangement of <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> subpopulations suggest that cell–cell interactions are involved in the differentiation of this cell class. To test whether defects of such interactions may be, at least in part, responsible for mutant phenotypes, we performed mosaic analysis and demonstrated that the loss of parvalbumin-positive amacrine cells in chy mutants is due to extrinsic (cell-nonautonomous) causes. The phenotype of another <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> subpopulation, the GABA-positive cells, does not display a clear cell-nonautonomy in chy animals.

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{elucidate}} the synaptic transmission between bipolar cells and amacrine cells, {{the effect of}} polarization of a bipolar cell on an <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> was examined by simultaneous intracellular recordings from both cells in the isolated carp retina. When either an ON or OFF bipolar cell was depolarized by an extrinsic current step, an ON-OFF <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> was transiently depolarized {{at the onset of}} the current but no sustained polarization during the current was detected. The current hyperpolarizing the OFF bipolar cell also produced the transient depolarization of the <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> at the termination of the current. These responses had a latency of ~ 10 ms. The amplitude of the current-evoked responses changed gradually with current intensity within the range used in these experiments.

These results confirm directly that ON-OFF amacrine cells receive excitatory inputs from both ON and OFF bipolar cells: the ON transient is due to inputs from ON bipolar cells, and the OFF transient to inputs from OFF bipolar cells. The steady polarization of bipolar cells is converted into transient signals during the synaptic process...|$|E

To {{study the effects of}} these gap junctions, we developed a linear, mathematical model of the retinal circuitry providing input to parasol cells. Electrophysiological studies have indicated that gap junctions do not enlarge the receptive field centres of parasol cells, but our results suggest that they make other contributions to their light responses. According to our model, the coupled <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> enhance the responses of parasol cells to luminance contrast by disinhibition. We also show how a mixed chemical and electrical synapse between two sets of <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> presynaptic to the parasol cells might make the responses of parasol cells more transient and, therefore, more sensitive to motion. Finally, we show how coupling via <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> can synchronize the firing of parasol cells. An action potential in a model parasol cell can excite neighbouring parasol cells, but only when the coupled <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> also fire action potentials. Passive conduction was ineffective due to low-pass temporal filtering. Inhibition from the axons of the coupled <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> also produced oscillations that might synchronize the firing of more distant ganglion cells...|$|R
40|$|The retina avoids signal {{saturation}} {{through the}} use of both dim-light sensing rod and bright-light sensing cone photoreceptor circuits. Photoreceptors are responsible for converting an image into an electrical signal, which is transmitted to bipolar cells and ganglion <b>cells.</b> <b>Amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> modulate the interaction between bipolar cells and ganglion cells through inhibitory signaling, and therefore play a large part in inner retinal processing. However, inhibitory connections between <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> are a little understood signaling component of the retina. Within this study, <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> within the mouse retina were separated into two categories: narrow-field glycinergic and wide-field GABAergic. <b>Amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> were subjected to a light stimuli under dark-adapted, light-adapted, and receptor isolated conditions, and the peak amplitude and charge transfer of the L-IPSC was measured. Wide-field <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> received an increase in the percentage of inhibition from glycine after light adaptation. There is an overall decrease in spontaneous activity with light adaptation, but an increase in the percent of glycinergic spontaneous activity. Spatial inhibition to narrow-field <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> becomes narrower with light adaptation. L-IPSC peak amplitude decreases with light adaptation with application of a full-field light stimulus, and also decreases as the distance between the stimulus and the cell body increases...|$|R
40|$|While {{connections}} between inhibitory interneurons are common circuit elements, {{it has been}} difficult to define their signal processing roles because of the inability to activate these circuits using natural stimuli. We overcame this limitation by studying {{connections between}} inhibitory amacrine cells in the retina. These interneurons form spatially extensive inhibitory networks that shape signaling between bipolar cell relay neurons to ganglion cell output neurons. We investigated how <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> networks modulate these retinal signals by selectively activating the networks with spatially defined light stimuli. The roles of <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> networks were assessed by recording their inhibitory synaptic outputs in bipolar cells that suppress bipolar cell output to ganglion cells. When the <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> network was activated by large light stimuli, the inhibitory connections between amacrine cells unexpectedly depressed bipolar cell inhibition. Bipolar cell inhibition elicited by smaller light stimuli or electrically activated feedback inhibition was not suppressed because these stimuli did not activate the connections between amacrine cells. Thus the activation of <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> circuits with large light stimuli can shape the spatial sensitivity of the retina by limiting the spatial extent of bipolar cell inhibition. Because inner retinal inhibition contributes to ganglion cell surround inhibition, in part, by controlling input from bipolar cells, these connections may refine the spatial properties of the retinal output. This functional role of interneuron connections may be repeated throughout the CNS...|$|E
40|$|Pattern {{recognition}} {{has been}} used for the complete and statistically rigid classification of retinal neurons in vertebrates such as the adult cat, primate, rat and goldfish. Here, we label the mouse retina with antibodies against seven amino acids and use pattern recognition to characterize distinct retinal neurochemical cell classes based on their unique amino acid signatures. We followed the development of the cell classes in the X-inactivation transgenic mouse expressing the lacZ reporter gene on one X-chromosome. This mouse allows clonally related cells to be identified through differential β-galactosidase activity due to random X-chromosome inactivation. Pattern recognition analysis partitioned the retina into nine neuronal classes at birth, increasing to 19 classes at eye opening and 26 classes by adulthood. Emergence of new cell classes was partly attributed to new neuron types and partly to the splitting of classes from early ages from refinement of their amino acid profiles. All six GABAergic <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> classes and most ganglion cell classes appeared by P 7 whilst all the glycinergic <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> classes did not appear till adulthood. Separable bipolar cell classes were not detected till eye opening. Photoreceptor cell classes were detected at P 3 but inner and outer segments did not form separable classes until adulthood. More importantly, we show that cells which share common amino acid profiles also shared cell dispersion patterns. GABAergic <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> classes with conventional and displaced counterparts transgressed clonal boundaries whereas GABAergic <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> classes found exclusively in the inner nuclear layer and all glycinergic <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> classes did not transgress. Ganglion cells displayed both dispersion patterns. This study provides a comprehensive neurochemical atlas of the developing mouse retina, tracking the amino acid levels within distinct neuronal populations and highlighting unique migratory patterns within subpopulations of inner retinal neurons...|$|E
40|$|Background: Amacrine interneurons that {{modulate}} {{synaptic plasticity}} between bipolar and ganglion cells constitute {{the most diverse}} cell type in the retina. Most are inhibitory neurons using either GABA or glycine as neurotransmitters. Although several transcription factors involved in <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> fate determination have been identified, mechanisms underlying <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> subtype specification remain to be further understood. The Prdm 13 histone methyltransferase encoding gene is a target of the transcription factor Ptf 1 a, an essential regulator of inhibitory neuron cell fate in the retina. Here, we have deepened our knowledge on its interaction with Ptf 1 a and investigated its role in <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> subtype determination in the developing Xenopus retina. Methods: We performed prdm 13 gain and loss of function in Xenopus and assessed the impact on retinal cell fate determination using RT-qPCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Results: We found that prdm 13 in the amphibian Xenopus is expressed in late retinal progenitors and in {{about half of the}} mature amacrine cells, predominantly in glycinergic ones. Clonal analysis in the retina reveals that prdm 13 overexpression favours <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> fate determination, with a bias towards glycinergic cells. Conversely, knockdown of prdm 13 specifically inhibits glycinergic <b>amacrine</b> <b>cell</b> genesis. We also showed that, as in the neural tube, prdm 13 is subjected to a negative autoregulation in the retina. Our data suggest that this is likely due to its ability to repress the expression of its inducer, ptf 1 a. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that Prdm 13, downstream of Ptf 1 a, acts as an important regulator of glycinergic amacrine subtype specification in the Xenopus retina. We also reveal that Prdm 13 regulates ptf 1 a expression through a negative feedback loop. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of neuronal {{nitric oxide synthase}} (NOS) immunoreactivity was examined in rat and rabbit retinas and was compared with the {{distribution of}} {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADPH) -diaphorase reactivity and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) immunoreactivity. An antibody raised against a C-terminal fragment of a cloned rat cerebellar NOS was used to localise NOS immunoreactivity. NOS immunoreactive cells were not detected in rat retinas at postnatal day 1 or 4, but were seen from postnatal day 7 onwards. NOS immunolabelling was seen in a small population of cells in the proximal inner nuclear layer. Most of the labelled cells had the position of <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> and were seen to send processes into the inner plexiform layer. A few labelled cells were at times also seen in the ganglion cell layer, which are likely to correspond to displaced <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells.</b> The same NOS-labelling pattern was seen in rat and rabbit retinas. NADPH-diaphorase staining was observed in both species, in photoreceptor inner segments, in cells with the position of horizontal cells, in a subset of amacrine and displaced <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells,</b> in large cell bodies in the ganglion cell layer, in both plexiform layers, and in endothelium. Colocalisation of NOS immunoreactivity and NADPH-diaphorase staining was only observed among <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells.</b> However, not all NADPH-diaphorase-reactive <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> were found to be NOS immunoreactive. VIP immunoreactivity was also localised in rat retinas in a subpopulation of <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells,</b> but no colocalisation of NOS and VIP immunoreactivity was observed. Our observations indicate that only <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> contain the NOS form recognisable by the antibody used, and suggest that different isoforms of neuronal NOS may be present in retinal cells. Further, the onset of NOS expression in rat <b>amacrine</b> <b>cells</b> appears to occur independently of neuronal activity...|$|R
