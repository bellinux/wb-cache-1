The thermal neutron <b>activation</b> <b>cross-section</b> of ytterbium- 168 is 3, 470 barns; in core positions in the reactor this is significantly increased by the contribution of epithermal neutron activation. Flux depression and target burnup are such that the activation formula normally used for radioisotope production calculations is inadequate. Therefore, a modified formula which includes corrections for these effects, combined with iterative computer calculations to correct for effects resulting from the change in target mass during irradiation, was used to calculate ytterbium- 169 yields. It was found that for targets containing 10 mg and 20 mg of Yb 2 O 3, there is an optimum ytterbium- 168 enrichment of approximately 20 per cent.

Simulations of the spectral flux from present source at a position of irradiated samples were performed using CYRIC TOF-data validated in the present work against LA 150 h by calculations with the transport Monte Carlo code MCNPX. Simulated spectra were tested by absolute measurements using a proton-recoil telescope technique.

Different discharge burn-up levels are considered: a low burn-up, corresponding to the equilibrium cycle, and a high burn-up level, simulating the effects on the fuel of the multi-recycling scenario. In order to perform this study, we propose a methodology in two steps. Firstly, we compute the uncertainties on the system parameters by using a Monte Carlo simulation, as it is considered the most reliable approach to address this problem. Secondly, the analysis of the results is performed by a sensitivity technique, in order to identify the relevant reaction channels and prioritize the data improvement needs. Cross-section uncertainties are taken from the EAF- 2007 /UN library since it includes data for all the actinides potentially present in the irradiated fuel.

The response of these systems to both gamma-rays and heavy ions is characterized by two parameters: 1) Dγ 37, the dose of gamma-rays at which 37 % of the sensitive elements remain unaffected by the radiation, and 2) a 0, the physical radius (or the exciton diffusion length, or the range of short-range order) of the sensitive element. The decline of detector response with increase in the stopping power of the bombarding ion, and the non-linearity of the detector response are characteristic properties of 1 -hit detectors, and are most pronounced for the most sensitive detectors.

40|$|From {{time to time}} various {{analytical}} methods have been applied to tooth substance to establish the content of so-called trace elements such as lead and tin. " 2 Other ex-perimental work has shown that these trace elements may play {{an important part in}} the formation and preservation of teeth. 3 - 6 As trace elements are present in very low concentrations, it has been necessary in previous investigations to use pooled material from many different subjects to provide an adequate sample for analysis by chemical, spectrographic, or colorimetric methods. The conclusions which may be drawn from such experiments are necessarily limited by the non-specific nature of the material. Radioactivation analysis is a technic by which many elements may be detected and estimated with a greater sensitivity than that of conventional analytical procedures. The essential basis of the method is that the element to be determined is made radio-active by exposing the sample to bombardment by neutrons inside a neutron reactor. The radioactivity induced in this way has properties which are characteristic of the element concerned. After suitable chemical separation of the element, if necessary, the amount of the induced radioactivity, the rate of its decay, and the energy of the associated nuclear radiations can be measured without much difficulty by instruments such as Geiger and scintillation counters.

The large neutron <b>activation</b> <b>cross-section</b> of the parent isotope (11. 40 barn including that of a meta-stable state) allows the activation of this nuclide in a low neutron fluence reactor, making its production easily available for both research and therapy purposes. From simulations and measurement of the doses, exposure rates due to the 3. 7 % gamma component showed to be clinically small for the patients' healthy organs and tissues as well as to medical staff and general public. Furthermore, it was studied whether its gamma component could be effective in performing pre-treatment quality assurance (QA) and dosimetry, as well as post-treatment biodistribution imaging and dose distributions of permanently implanted ¹⁴²Pr brachytherapy sources. Two main novel applications of ¹⁴²Pr beta emitters are studied in this work: (i) ¹⁴²Pr glass microspheres, as a possible choice of radionuclide for microsphere brachytherapy of nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastasis of the liver, and (ii) ¹⁴²Pr glass rods for brachytherapy of ocular squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), based on a novel design for eye brachytherapy [...] also developed in this work. In order to simulate the dosimetric characteristics of ¹⁴²Pr, MCNPX 2. 6 Monte Carlo code and BRAIN-DOSE Dose Point Kernel code were used to determine the dose distributions of ¹⁴²Pr for different source distributions. Dosimetric properties of the currently used nuclide in microsphere brachytherapy, Yttrium- 90 (⁹⁰Y), was also studied and compared to ¹⁴²Pr. A more realistic biodistribution model of microspheres within a single HCCs blood vessel was studied. In addition, the biological effective dose (BED) for different tumor doubling times (DT) for HCC was determined using the linear quadratic (LQ) model for both nuclides. Dose distributions for ¹⁴²Pr, ⁹⁰Y and Rhenium- 188 were simulated within the eyeball and compared for application in eye brachytherapy. Measurements of dose distribution using GAFCHROMIC® EBT 2 film were performed with ¹⁴²Pr glass microspheres and ¹⁴²Pr glass rods. Monte Carlo simulation validation with experimental measurements in phantom of the dose distribution due to ¹⁴²Pr glass microspheres and ¹⁴²Pr glass rods were performed. ¹⁴²Pr showed to be a possible choice of radionuclide for HCC microsphere brachytherapy and OSCC brachytherapy, delivering a high biological effective dose, and opening possibilities for post treatment imaging and biodistribution assessment.

40|$|This report address two issues, {{namely the}} ``Selection {{of the most}} current nuclear data {{libraries}} available`` and the ``User`s manual of the updated ACAB code``. A general summary of the major features of ACAB is provides in Section 1 which highlights the new capabilities included in the present version of ACAB. We {{address the issue of}} the nuclear data libraries selected as starting point in preparing the libraries to be used directly by ACAB. Section II describes the main features of the selected libraries. In Section IV, the impact of using these libraries in Inertial Fusion Energy, IFE, applications is assessed by comparing activation results obtained using different <b>activation</b> <b>cross-sections</b> data libraries. The points considered are the processing of libraries and libraries adapted to be directly read by ACAB. The ``processing`` efforts made within the frame of this project have been focused on the COLLAPSE code. Important modifications have been made, and in Section IV we provide an overall description of the new version. The content of the data bases employed by the updated ACAB code are described in Section V. The input data file for running ACAB is dealt with in Section VI, and some example problems are discussed in Section VII. Finally, regarding analysis of activation results we described in Section VIII the updated version of the CHAINS code...|$|R
40|$|A deep-level {{transient}} spectroscopy (DLTS) {{technique is}} reported {{for determining the}} capture <b>cross-section</b> <b>activation</b> energy directly. Conventionally, the capture activation energy is obtained from the temperature dependence of the capture cross section. Capture cross-section measurement is often very doubtful due to many intrinsic errors and is more critical for nonexponential capture kinetics. The essence of this technique is to use an emission pulse to allow the defects to emit electrons and the transient signal from capture process due to a large capture barrier was analyzed, {{in contrast with the}} emission signal in conventional DLTS. This technique has been applied for determining the capture barrier for silicon-related DX centers in $Al_xGa_{ 1 -x}As$ for different AlAs mole fractions...|$|R
