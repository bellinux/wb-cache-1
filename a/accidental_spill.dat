2500|$|Chlorine is a {{relatively}} common gas in industry {{with a variety of}} uses. It is used to disinfect water as well as being a part of the sanitation process for sewage and industrial waste. Chlorine is also used as a bleaching agent during the production of paper and cloth. Many household cleaning products, including bleach, contain chlorine. Given the volume and ease of chlorine for industrial and commercial use, exposure could occur from an <b>accidental</b> <b>spill</b> or a deliberate attack. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends that a person wear splash proof goggles, a face shield and a respirator mask when working in the vicinity of chlorine gas. Because chlorine is a gas at room temperature, most exposure occurs via inhalation. Exposure may also occur through skin or eye contact or by ingesting chlorine-contaminated food or water. Chlorine is a strong oxidizing element causing the hydrogen to split from water in moist tissue, resulting in nascent oxygen and hydrogen chloride that cause corrosive tissue damage. Additionally oxidation of chlorine may form hypochlorous acid, which can penetrate cells and react with cytoplasmic proteins destroying cell structure. Chlorine’s odor provides early warning signs of exposure but causes olfactory fatigue or adaptations, reducing awareness of exposure at low concentrations. With increased exposure, symptoms may progress to labored respirations, severe coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, dyspnea, and broncospasm associated with a decrease in oxygen saturation level[...] Severe exposure may result in [...] changes in upper and lower airways resulting in an acute lung injury, which may not be present until several hours after exposure. A recent chlorine gas leak in Pune, India, landed 20 individuals in the hospital. Though that was an accidental exposure, chlorine gas {{has been used as a}} weapon of warfare since World War I, most recently in 2007 in Iraq.|$|E

50|$|The rich greenish-blue {{and brown}} colours of this stone are most popular. It is an {{excellent}} building stone. It is mainly used for exteriors, pathways, corridors, driveways, balconies, commercial buildings etc. It is not suitable for use in chemical industries as any <b>accidental</b> <b>spilling</b> of any type or abrasive material results in discoloration of the flooring.It is also {{interesting to note that}} even a drop of lemon juice can result in white patches on the floor even after you've got it polished.So this type of stone is a poor choice for using in residential settings where <b>accidental</b> <b>spilling</b> of common household items like sodas, colas, lemon juices, or any mild acidic or alkaline substances are likely to happen.Other colors-black, pink, grey, beige.|$|R

40|$|<b>Accidental</b> <b>spills,</b> while {{inherently}} random processes, {{are influenced}} by preventive actions taken by ship-owners. Coast Guard vessel inspection and oil transfer monitoring policies for controlling oil spills are designed to control both deliberate and <b>accidental</b> <b>spills.</b> Ship-owners' responses to regulation affect the Coast Guard's costs of inspection and monitoring. We capture this interaction of policy, preventive actions, and costs in a Stackelberg-like game-theoretic model. Post- 1983 Coast Guard policies for inspection and monitoring include a two-tiered classification of oil transporting vessels. Ships failing inspections or {{with a history of}} oil spills are put on a High Priority list and subject to more frequent inspection and monitoring. We show that the punitive value of keeping a vessel on the High Priority list can be a cheap way of enforcing regulations. We also discuss the findings of recent empirical studies of Coast Guard policies. Acknowledgements: This paper is funded in [...] ...|$|R

50|$|When {{the price}} of gold was {{released}} by the federal government, prices rose, and feasibility studies were begun on some of the old sites. At the Brewer gold mine, between Jefferson and Lynches River, it was deemed to have sufficient reserves to open it with modern machinery and technology. Between 1987 and 1991 the mine produced 118,000 troy ounces (3670 kg) of gold, by crushing the ore and leaching it with a cyanide solution to dissolve the gold. In 1990 an <b>accidental</b> <b>spill</b> released cyanide into Lynches River and 11,000 fish died. The mine was closed for a few months for cleanup and repair.|$|E

40|$|Oil and gas {{installations}} are {{a source}} of oil inputs to the North Sea. Those inputs can include oil discharge as a result of production processes or from <b>accidental</b> <b>spills.</b> Two bodies {{play a major role in}} monitoring oil inputs from those installations. The OSPAR Commission is responsible for monitoring oil and gas installations against various performance standards, collects samples from those installations to determine whether those standards have been met or exceeded, and also monitors <b>accidental</b> <b>spills.</b> The Bonn Agreement Secretariat also plays a role through its aerial surveillance and, more recently, satellite monitoring activities in the North Sea region. Once a spill has been identified and confirmed as being mineral oil rather than other types of oils or even algae or a natural event, the Bonn Agreement seeks to identify the source of that oil. Through a programme of surveillance activities, it also specifically monitors the areas around oil and gas fields. This chapter provides an overview of the activities of the OSPAR Commission and Bonn Secretariat as they relate to oil and gas installations and examines data on inputs of oil to the marine environment to identify trends in oil pollution from those installations...|$|R

50|$|In May 2010, McNutt {{headed the}} Flow Rate Technical Group which {{attempted}} {{to measure the}} Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

Subsequent estimates, based on six independent methodologies, were four times the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. A refined estimate based on new pressure readings, data, and analysis, released by the United States Secretary of Energy Steven Chu and McNutt in August, said that 4.9 million barrels (with uncertainty of plus or minus approximately 10 percent) of oil had leaked from the well until it was capped on July 15.
