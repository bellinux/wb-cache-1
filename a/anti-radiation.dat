5|$|Unguided {{air-to-ground}} weaponry includes rocket pods, gravity {{bombs and}} Matra Durandal anti-runway munitions. Precision-guided munitions such as LGBs and satellite-guided bombs are also {{compatible with the}} JF-17, as are other guided weapons such as anti-ship missiles and <b>anti-radiation</b> missiles. Pakistan planned to bring the Brazilian MAR-1 <b>anti-radiation</b> missile into service on its JF-17 fleet in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} to {{the first generation of}} fixed installation surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) such as SA-2 and SA-3 was the development of the <b>anti-radiation</b> missile such as AGM-45 Shrike and other means to attack fixed SAM installations, as well as developing SEAD doctrines. The Soviet counter-response was the use of mobile SAMs such as SA-6 with intermittent use of radar. Thus, the SAM battery was only visible for a small period of time, during which it was also a significant threat to high-value Wild Weasel fighters. In 1982 Operation Mole Cricket 19 various means including UAVs and air-launched Samson decoys were used over suspected SAM areas to saturate enemy SAMs and to bait them to activate their radar systems, which were then attacked by <b>anti-radiation</b> missiles.|$|E
5|$|By 2007, {{both the}} Sea Eagle anti-ship missile and the ALARM <b>anti-radiation</b> missile that {{previously}} equipped the RSAF's Tornados had been withdrawn from service. As of 2010, Saudi Arabia has signed several contracts for new weapon systems to be fitted to their Tornado and Typhoon fleets, {{such as the}} short range air-to-air IRIS-T missile, and the Brimstone and Storm Shadow cruise missiles.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{a number}} of programs, such as the IAI Harpy or the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, {{integrated}} <b>anti-radiation</b> sensors into a drone or missile air frames coupled with command and control and loitering capabilities. This allowed the attacking force to place relatively cheap munitions in place over suspected SAM sites, and to attack promptly the moment the SAM battery is visible. This integrated {{the use of a}} drone as a baiting decoy with the attack role into one small and relatively cheap platform in comparison to the alternative wild weasel jet fighter.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado is {{cleared to}} carry the {{majority}} of air-launched weapons in the NATO inventory, including various unguided and laser-guided bombs, anti-ship and <b>anti-radiation</b> missiles, as well as specialised weapons such as anti-personnel mines and anti-runway munitions. To improve survivability in combat, the Tornado is equipped with onboard countermeasures, ranging from flare and chaff dispensers to electronic countermeasure pods that can be mounted under the wings. Underwing fuel tanks and a buddy store aerial refuelling system that allows one Tornado to refuel another are available to extend the aircraft's range.|$|E
5|$|The Wild Weasels {{also carried}} {{electronic}} countermeasures (ECM) equipment to protect themselves. They directed flak suppression strikes and carried AGM-45 Shrike <b>anti-radiation</b> missiles (another Navy development), which homed {{in on the}} radar systems of the SAMs. The SA-2 had greater range than the Shrike, but if the Shrike was launched and the radar operator stayed on the air, the American missile would home in on the signal and destroy the radar source. A sophisticated cat and mouse game then ensued between North Vietnamese radar operators and the Wild Weasel pilots.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} EF-105F Wild Weasel III (the EF designation was popularly used but unofficial) supplemented its {{sensors and}} electronic jamming equipment with AGM-45 Shrike <b>anti-radiation</b> missiles and conventional bombs, giving it an offensive capability {{lacking in the}} F-100F. The first of these aircraft flew on 15 January 1966 and they began arriving in Southeast Asia in May, flying their first mission on 6 June 1966, with five assigned to the 13th TFS at Korat RTAFB and six more to the 354th TFS at Takhli RTAFB.|$|E
5|$|During the conflict, several {{claims of}} Iraqi air-to-air successes were made, {{including}} an Iraqi pilot, Khudai Hijab, who allegedly fired a Vympel R-27R missile from his MIG-29 and damaged a B-52G {{on the opening}} night of the Gulf War. However, the U.S. Air Force disputes this claim, stating the bomber was actually hit by friendly fire, an AGM-88 High-speed, <b>Anti-Radiation</b> Missile (HARM) that homed on the fire-control radar of the B-52's tail gun; the jet was subsequently renamed In HARM's Way. Shortly following this incident, General George Lee Butler announced that the gunner position on B-52 crews would be eliminated, and the gun turrets permanently deactivated, commencing on 1 October 1991.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1980s, the Stinger and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air {{missiles}} and the AGM-122 Sidearm <b>anti-radiation</b> missile were evaluated for use upon the AH-64. The Stinger was initially selected; the U.S. Army was also considering the Starstreak air-to-air missile. External fuel tanks {{can also be}} carried on the stub wings to increase range and mission time. The stub-wing pylons have mounting points for maintenance access; these mountings {{can be used to}} secure externally personnel for emergency transportation. Stinger missiles are often used on non-U.S. Apaches, as foreign forces do not have as many air superiority aircraft to control the skies. The AH-64E initially lacked the ability to use the Stinger to make room for self-defense equipment, but the capability was re-added following a South Korean demand.|$|E
5|$|Operated by Germany and Italy, the ECR (Electric Combat / Reconnaissance) is a Tornado variant {{devoted to}} Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions. It was first {{delivered}} on 21 May 1990. The ECR has sensors to detect radar usage and {{is equipped with}} <b>anti-radiation</b> AGM-88 HARM missiles. The Luftwaffe's 35 ECRs were delivered new, while Italy received 16 converted IDSs. Italian Tornado ECRs differ from the Luftwaffe aircraft as they lack built-in reconnaissance capability and use RecceLite reconnaissance pods, also only Luftwaffe ECRs are equipped with RB199 Mk.105 engine, which has a slightly higher thrust rating. The German ECRs do not carry a cannon. The RAF uses the IDS version in the SEAD role instead of the ECR. It also modified several of its Tornado F.3s to undertake the mission.|$|E
5|$|The Mastiff RPVs went {{in first}} {{to cause the}} Syrian SAMs to turn on their radars by convincing the Syrians that many attack {{aircraft}} were overhead. Once the Mastiffs were tracked by Syrian radar, the tracking signals were relayed to another Scout outside of the missiles' range. The Scout then relayed the signal to E2C Hawkeye aircraft orbiting off the coast. The data gathered was analyzed by the E2Cs and Boeing 707 ECM aircraft. Once the SAM crews fired missiles at the drones, the F-15s and F-16s provided air cover while F-4 Phantoms attacked the SAM batteries, destroying them with AGM-78 and AGM-45 <b>anti-radiation</b> missiles. The rapid flight time of the missiles minimized the F-4s' exposure to the SAMs. The Syrians reportedly fired 57 SA-6s, to no effect.|$|E
5|$|With {{the start}} of the fire preparation, tank hunting detachments—groups of ten {{equipped}} with RPG-7 rockets, RPG-43 grenades, and AT-3 Sagger missiles—crossed the canal to deploy one kilometer deep, quickly occupying the tank ramparts, and proceeded to set up ambushes and lay mines. When the first barrage ended, Egyptian artillery began a second, 22 minute-long barrage, against targets at a depth of 1.5–3kilometers. At this time, 14:20, the first wave of assault infantry, 4,000 men, began crossing the canal. Around 2,500 dinghies and wooden boats were used to transport the troops. Smoke canisters were used at the crossing points to provide cover. During the night of October 5, engineers had blocked the underwater pipes on the opposite bank, preventing the Israelis from releasing flammable oil into the canal and igniting it. The first wave was lightly equipped, armed with RPG-7s, Strela 2 AA missiles and rope ladders to deploy on the sand wall. Among the first wave were combat engineers and several units of Sa'iqa (lightning; these were commando forces), who were tasked with setting up ambushes on reinforcement routes. The Sa'iqa attacked command posts and artillery batteries in order to deny the Israelis control over their forces, while the engineers breached the minefields and barbed wire surrounding Israeli defenses. Immediately following them, military engineers transported the water pumps to the opposite bank and began setting them up. At this time Egyptian aircraft involved in the air strike began returning. Five aircraft were lost, although {{by the end of the}} day this rose to ten. The air strike put the Bir Gifgafa and Bir Thamada air bases out of operation for 48 hours, and damaged the Ras Nasrani and Bir Hasanah airbases. Around ten HAWK batteries, at least two 175mm artillery batteries, an electronic jamming center at Umm Khashib, and various radar stations were destroyed. This allowed the Egyptian Air Force to operate for the rest of the war without any ground-based communications interference, as the only other jamming center in the Sinai was located at el-Arish, considerably behind the front. Over a dozen AS-5 Kelt missiles were fired from Tu-16 bombers as well. Several were shot down, but at least five hit their targets, including two missiles fitted with <b>anti-radiation</b> seekers that knocked out Israeli radars. The success of the air strike caused the Egyptians to cancel a planned second air strike. Another account however states that 18 Egyptian aircraft were lost, and these losses prompted the canceling of a second wave of airstrikes.|$|E

25|$|ALARM (Air Launched <b>Anti-Radiation</b> Missile) is a British <b>anti-radiation</b> missile {{designed}} {{primarily to}} destroy enemy radars {{for the purpose}} of Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD). It was used by the RAF and is still used by the Royal Saudi Air Force. The weapon was retired by the UK at the end of 2013.|$|E
25|$|The AGM-88E Advanced <b>Anti-Radiation</b> Guided Missile (AARGM) is {{an upgrade}} to the AGM-88 High-speed <b>Anti-Radiation</b> Missile (HARM). The AARGM {{is the result}} of {{cooperation}} between the United States and Italy. It is produced by ATK. In September 2013, ATK delivered the 100th AARGM to the U.S. Navy. It will be initially integrated onto the FA-18C/D, FA-18E/F, EA-18G, and Tornado ECR aircraft and later on the F-35. The AGM-88E development program was proceeded on schedule and did not exceed its budget.|$|E
25|$|T-72M2 – Indigenous tank design, {{based on}} the Russian T-72M1, with new night vision and thermal devices, {{improved}} armour (up to 650mm) and <b>anti-radiation</b> cladding, rubber side skirts, C4I and IR suppression coating.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, the Bendix Corporation {{was awarded}} a {{contract}} to develop an <b>anti-radiation</b> missile passive radar seeker to guide the Hound Dog missile to antennas transmitting radar signals. A Hound Dog with this radar seeker was test-flown in 1973, but never mass-produced.|$|E
25|$|The F-8 Crusader is {{the only}} {{aircraft}} to have used the AIM-9C which is a radar-guided variant of the Sidewinder. When the Crusader retired, these missiles were converted to the AGM-122 Sidearm <b>anti-radiation</b> missiles used by United States attack helicopters to knock out enemy radars.|$|E
25|$|The Kh-31 missile was {{developed}} by Zvezda-Strela in the Soviet Union starting in 1977 for service as a long-range anti-ship missile and <b>anti-radiation</b> missile, first being flown in 1982. Derived from the P-270 Moskit missile, the Kh-31 is conventional in shape, and has cruciform fins made from titanium, with a rocket-ramjet propulsion system providing thrust.|$|E
25|$|The first air-to-air <b>anti-radiation</b> missile {{developed}} by the United States, the Brazo utilised the airframe of the existing AIM-7E Sparrow air-to-air missile, fitted with a new, Hughes-built passive radar seeker head {{developed by}} the Naval Electronics Center. The seeker was intended to detect and home on enemy radar emissions, such as those on interceptor and AWACS aircraft.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{designed}} to minimize its radar-signature through stealth (low-observability). This <b>anti-radiation</b> drone is designed to target enemy air-defense systems in a first line of attack, as the small drone (with its small Radar Cross Section) can evade SAMs and radar detection systems which are designed to target much larger aircraft or to intercept fixed-trajectory missiles.|$|E
25|$|The Bereznyak design bureau had {{developed}} the liquid-fuelled Kh-28 (AS-9 ‘Kyle’) and the KSR-5P <b>anti-radiation</b> missiles. They merged with Raduga in 1967, so Raduga {{was given the}} contract in the early 1970s to develop a solid-fuel successor to the Kh-28 to equip the new Su-24M 'Fencer-D' attack aircraft. Consequently, the project was initially designated the Kh-24, before becoming the Kh-58.|$|E
25|$|A further upgrade, {{disclosed}} in early 2003, was {{the integration of}} the ALARM <b>anti-radiation</b> missile to enable several Tornado ADVs to conduct Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions. The F3's existing radar warning receivers formed the basis of an Emission Location System (ELS), which can be employed to detect and locate operational radar systems in the aircraft's vicinity. These modified aircraft were re-designated Tornado EF3 and operated by No. 11 Squadron RAF.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{government}} {{believes that}} such jammers were used occasionally during the War in Afghanistan, and the U.S. military {{claims to have}} destroyed six GPS jammers during the Iraq War, including one that was destroyed with a GPS-guided bomb. A GPS jammer {{is relatively easy to}} detect and locate, making it an attractive target for <b>anti-radiation</b> missiles. The UK Ministry of Defence tested a jamming system in the UK's West Country on 7 and 8 June 2007.|$|E
25|$|HQ-9 – In October 2003 it was {{reported}} that China had closed a deal with Pakistan to supply an unspecified number of FT-2000 systems, an <b>anti-radiation</b> variant of the HQ-9 long range air defence system, although in March 2009 a report was published stating that Pakistan was not considering importing the missile. It {{was reported}} in mid-2008 that Pakistan intended to purchase a high altitude air defence and missile defence system and the FD-2000, another variant of HQ-9, was expected to be chosen.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Defence {{received}} {{bids for}} a new <b>anti-radiation</b> missile in late 1982; British Aerospace Dynamics offered ALARM while Texas Instruments teamed with Lucas Aerospace offered its HARM missile. Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine announced the selection of ALARM on 29 July 1983. The initial order was 750 missiles for the RAF. The selection process was controversial; the battle between the contractors was bitter, the Ministry of Defence favoured ALARM to retain UK industrial capabilities while the Treasury favoured the cheaper and proven HARM.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} the first Wild Weasel SEAD (air defense suppression) {{aircraft}} whose specially trained crews were tasked with locating and destroying enemy air defenses. Four F-100F Wild Weasel Is were fitted with an APR-25 vector radar homing and warning (RHAW) receiver, IR-133 panoramic receivers with greater detection range, and KA-60 panoramic cameras. The APR-25 could detect early-warning radars and emissions from SA-2 Guideline tracking and guidance systems. These aircraft deployed to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, in November 1965, began flying combat missions with the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing in December. They were joined by three more aircraft in February 1966. All Wild Weasel F-100Fs were eventually modified to fire the AGM-45 Shrike <b>anti-radiation</b> missile.|$|E
25|$|T-55A (Ob'yekt 155A) - Produced 1963–1981, in Poland 1964–1979. The T-55A MBT was {{primarily}} developed to incorporate a new antiradiation lining and full PAZ/FVU chemical filtration system. One {{of the major}} internal additions {{was the use of}} a plasticized lead sheeting for antiradiation protection. This was evident externally due to use of an enlarged driver's hatch and enlarged combings over the commander's and loader's hatch to accommodate the new material. Improved POV <b>anti-radiation</b> protection (leading to visibly protruding turret hatches) and NBC filtration, dispensed with bow machine gun. The coaxial SGMT machine gun was replaced with a PKT machine gun. The hull machine gun was removed, which made room for six more 100mm gun rounds Since 1970, T-55A tanks began to receive a new turret fitting for the 12.7mm DShK 1938/46 antiaircraft heavy machine gun.|$|E
25|$|For {{even higher}} speeds, {{the company began}} experimenting with pulsejet systems {{immediately}} after the war, building two experimental designs, the RP-21 and RP-26. In response to a call for high-speed target drones from the newly formed US Air Force, in 1950 the company introduced the Radioplane Q-1, powered by a small pulsejet. An attempt to build a version with the Continental YJ69 turbojet failed to find orders, and the role {{was taken over by}} the Ryan Firebee Q-2. Only a few dozen Q-1's were produced in total. However, the jet-powered Q-1 was then used {{in the development of the}} GAM-67 Crossbow, an experimental long-range <b>anti-radiation</b> missile. In 1953 they began development of the RP-61, a supersonic jet-powered drone that was powered by a XJ81 engine and able to reach Mach 1.55. Several improved models followed, but only 25 were produced in total.|$|E
500|$|The F-105G {{incorporated}} {{a considerable amount}} of new SEAD-specific avionics, including an upgraded Radar Homing and Warning (RHAW) system which required a redesign of the wingtips. To free outboard hardpoints for additional weapons, the Westinghouse AN/ALQ-105 electronic countermeasures were permanently installed in two long blisters {{on the underside of the}} fuselage. Thirty aircraft were fitted with pylons to carry the AGM-78 Standard <b>anti-radiation</b> missile. On a typical mission, the F-105G carried two Shrikes on outboard pylons, a single Standard on an inboard pylon balanced by a [...] fuel tank on the other side, and a [...] centerline fuel tank.|$|E
500|$|The French Air Force took {{delivery}} of the first production Jaguar in 1973, one of an eventual 160 single-seat Jaguar As. For type conversion training, France also took 40 of the two-seat Jaguar E. While the Jaguar was capable of carrying a single AN-52 nuclear bomb, the French government did not assign any Jaguars {{for use in the}} Force de frappe, France's strategic nuclear deterrent; this task was carried out by the Dassault Mirage IV, and the later Mirage 2000-N. Nuclear armed Jaguars were instead assigned the [...] "Pre-Strategic" [...] role, to clear a path for the Strategic strike force. The AN-52 nuclear bomb was retired from service in September 1991, when the formerly nuclear-armed squadrons of Escadron de Chasse 7 then concentrated on conventional attack. French Jaguars also performed in the role of Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) aircraft, bearing the Martel <b>anti-radiation</b> missile, capable of staying airborne to suppress enemy defences {{for long periods of time}} through mid air refuelling.|$|E
500|$|In {{recognition}} of the situation, the Security Council passed Resolution 958, which allowed NATO aircraft to operate in Croatia. [...] On 21 November, NATO acted under its new authority with a strike on the Udbina airfield. The strike, which involved 39 aircraft, was the largest combat operation in NATO's history up to that time; [...] nonetheless, it was criticized as a [...] "pinprick" [...] that did little real damage to Serb capabilities, only temporarily disabling runways. The NATO forces deliberately refrained from attacking Serb planes at the airfield, and only targeted runways and anti-air capabilities. Following the Udbina strike, NATO continued to launch strikes in the area, and on 23 November, after a NATO reconnaissance plane was illuminated by the radar of a surface-to-air missile (SAM) system, NATO planes attacked SAM sites at Otoka and Dvor with AGM-88 HARM <b>anti-radiation</b> missiles. The Serbs reacted to these strikes by immediately seizing 250 UNPROFOR hostages, {{and a total of}} 500 by early December. [...] While the hostages were treated fairly well, some were used as human shields, including three who were forced to lie on the tarmac at the Bosnian Serb airbase in Banja Luka.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, the Krajina army {{continued}} the Siege of Bihać, {{together with the}} Army of Republika Srpska from Bosnia. Michael Williams, {{an official of the}} UN peacekeeping force, said that when the village of Vedro Polje west of Bihać had fallen to a RSK unit in late November 1994, the siege entered the final stage. He added that heavy tank and artillery fire against the town of Velika Kladuša in the north of the Bihać enclave was coming from the RSK. Western military analysts said that among the array of Serbian surface-to-air missile systems that surround the Bihać pocket on Croatian territory, there was a modern SAM-2 system probably brought there from Belgrade. In response to the situation, the Security Council passed Resolution 958, which allowed NATO aircraft deployed {{as a part of the}} Operation Deny Flight to operate in Croatia. [...] On November 21, NATO attacked the Udbina airfield controlled by the RSK, temporarily disabling runways. Following the Udbina strike, NATO continued to launch strikes in the area, and on November 23, after a NATO reconnaissance plane was illuminated by the radar of a surface-to-air missile (SAM) system, NATO planes attacked a SAM site near Dvor with AGM-88 HARM <b>anti-radiation</b> missiles.|$|E
