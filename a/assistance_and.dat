5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two {{welfare reform}} bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare <b>assistance</b> <b>and</b> replaced the longstanding Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare <b>assistance,</b> <b>and</b> work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.|$|E
5|$|After 9 days, {{approximately}} 3,000 buildings (out of a {{total of}} 127,947 initially damaged) were still waiting for <b>assistance</b> <b>and</b> temporary fixes to shattered roofs and windows, while a similar number still required assistance a further week later (as a number of tarpaulins became detached or otherwise ineffective). One month after the disaster, the main priority of the emergency services was ensuring that temporary fixes remained in place, as Sydney suffered further adverse weather in the period immediately following the storm.|$|E

5|$|At the Eastern Gate, Thomas {{assembled}} more forces than at {{the other}} gates, so that Khalid {{would be unable to}} move to Shurahbil's <b>assistance</b> <b>and</b> take command in that decisive sector. Thomas' attack at several gates also gave more flexibility to the operation: if success were achieved in any sector other than the Gate of Thomas, such success could be exploited by sending troops to that sector to achieve the breakthrough. Thomas ordered Khalid to be taken alive.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} concerns facing the government in exile in 1940 was the situation of Belgian refugees in the United Kingdom.
