Models of control forces are established using the thin flexible shell theory and the membrane approximation. Analytical expressions of <b>actuating</b> <b>forces</b> and moments are derived and a parametric study is conducted to evaluate {{the effects of the}} physical properties of the actuator on the control forces.

The experimental results agree well with those obtained analytically. The results indicate the following: The laminated PVDF actuator (LPA) can provide effective control forces with low voltages. The control <b>forces</b> consist of <b>actuating</b> <b>forces</b> and moments, but the effect of the normal actuation force distribution is much greater than that of the actuation moments in controlling the normal vibration.

So for the 2 R 1 T PMs with combined DOFs, the suggested indices [19, 22] are independent of any coordinate frame and more appropriate for HSPMs. Basically, the linear actuated unit of the above mentioned PMs is the ball screw system, the fluctuations of its friction moment will have a direct impact on the stationarity of the driving system. Generally speaking, the axial load has direct effect on friction moment. So the fluctuations of <b>actuated</b> <b>force</b> will affect the friction moment, and then affect mechanical motion properties and dynamic behavior in the practical application [23, 24]. Other than motion/force transmission and orientation capability indices, the stability of the <b>actuated</b> <b>force</b> in each limb also needs to be paid attention.|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecently, in micro/nano {{fabrication}} equipments, linear motors {{are widely}} used as an actuator to position workpiece, machining tool and measurement head. To control them faster and more precise, the motor should have high <b>actuating</b> <b>force</b> and small force ripple. High <b>actuating</b> <b>force</b> enable us to more workpiece with high acceleration. Eventually, it may provide higher throughput. Force ripple gives detrimental effect on the precision and tracking performance of the equipments. In order to accomplish more precise motion, {{it is important to}} make lower the force ripple. Force ripple is categorized into cogging and mutual ripple. First is dependent on the shape of magnets and/or core. The second is not dependent on them but dependent on current commutation. In this work, coreless mover i. e. coil winding is applied to the linear motor to avoid the cogging ripple. Therefore, the mutual ripple is only considered to be minimized. Ideal Halbach magnet array has continuously varying magnetization. The THMA (Halbach magnet array with T shape magnets) is proposed to approximate the ideal one. The THMA can not produce ideal sinusoidal flux, therefore, the linear motor with THMA and sinusoidal commutation of current generates the mutual force ripple. In this paper, in order to compensate mutual force ripple by feedforward(FF) controller, we calculate the optimized commutation of input current. The ripple is lower than 1. 17 % of <b>actuating</b> <b>force</b> if the commutation current agree with the magnetic flux from THMA.

The present study was aimed to quantify human strength for operation of tractor controls and to recommend the maximum control actuating forces for normal operation of tractors based on strength capability of 3, 423 Indian male agricultural workers. The 5 th percentile values of strength parameters i. e. leg strength sitting (left and right), foot strength sitting (right), torque strength (both hands) sitting, push strength (left hand and right hand) sitting and pull strength (left hand and right hand) sitting of agricultural workers collected using a strength measurement set-up were taken into consideration for the study. It was recommended that the maximum actuating forces for normal operation of frequently operated brake and clutch pedals of tractors should not exceed 260 N and 125 N based on 5 th percentile values of right and left leg strength of male agricultural workers, respectively. The maximum <b>actuating</b> <b>force</b> required in steering wheel operation should not exceed 51 N based on 5 th percentile value of torque strength (both hands) sitting of workers.

The first effort {{is the work of}} the Design Modeling Group which is using the Adaptive Modeling Language (AML) to develop an objectbased technology assessment system. One of the advantages of this effort is that the analytical tools (legacy codes) that are used may be integrated into the AML environment one at a time, thereby providing many intermediate products each of which may enhance productivity. So while this effort is still in its infancy, a graphical user interface to the Automated STRuctural Optimization System (ASTROS) has been developed and is used in this effort to develop a parametrically defined finite element model. The second effort is the work on designing flexible wings without ailerons for performing roll maneuvers. Here a flexible wing is optimized for weight with constraints on strength for a 9 -g symmetric pull-up maneuver at M= 0. 85 at 30 psi and on the modal frequency distribution. Differential wing twist and camber is achieved by providing a system of actuating elements distributed within the internal substructure of the wing to provide roll control power. The modal approach was used to develop equilibrium equations for the steady roll maneuver of a wing subjected to aerodynamic loads and <b>actuating</b> <b>forces.</b> The distribution of <b>actuating</b> <b>forces</b> to achieve a specified flexible roll rate was determined by using an optimal control design approach.

Self-steering bogies {{have been used in}} large numbers of hauling locomotives primarily in the USA to reduce flange wear and improve adhesion. However, the steering performance of self-steering bogies is reported to deteriorate under traction. This article compares several bogie types and proposes a new design of steering bogie featuring forced steering combined with control of the bogie yaw movement or <b>actuated</b> yaw <b>forced</b> steered bogie (AY-FS). The bogie stability of a force steered bogie is improved by yaw actuation using a negative derivative control of the bogie yaw misalignment.

The article presents simulation results for a yaw <b>actuated</b> <b>force</b> steered bogie under traction curving conditions. The AY-FS bogie is compared with rigid and force steered bogies and is shown to give superior performance at high traction adhesion levels during curving. The curving performance improvements achieved depend on the curvature, lateral forces on the vehicle, the traction load, and the rail friction. The greatest curving performance advantages occur in tighter curvatures with high traction loads and low rail friction and with high lateral forces to the inside rail such as would result from coupler loads on pulling locomotives...|$|R
