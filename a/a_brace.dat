40|$|To be {{presented}} at 1988 ASME Winter Annual Meeting. The concepts of staging and bracing arc introduced with the specific example of <b>a</b> <b>bracing</b> manipulator. Staging describes the operational strategy which divides the positioning procedure into two or more levels to maximize {{the efficiency of the}} total positioning system. <b>A</b> <b>bracing</b> manipulator can be operated like a two-stage motion system. The bracing effect is evaluated from the view point of reduction of positioning uncertainty. Uncertainty sources in the manipulator, and the reduction of the positioning uncertainty by geometric bracing constraints arc analyzed. The framework of controlling <b>a</b> <b>bracing</b> manipulator will be discussed with the hybrid position and force control...|$|R

50|$|Bracing {{may be used}} {{to resist}} all the various forces which occur in an airframe, {{including}} lift, weight, drag and twisting or torsion. A strut is <b>a</b> <b>bracing</b> component stiff enough to resist these forces whether they place it under compression or tension. A wire is <b>a</b> <b>bracing</b> component able only to resist tension, going slack under compression, and consequently is nearly always used in conjunction with struts.|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{framework is}} proposed {{for evaluating the}} probability of "serviceability failure" in <b>a</b> <b>braced</b> excavation in <b>a</b> spatially random field. Here, the "serviceability failure" is said to occur when the excavation-induced wall or ground movement exceeds specified limiting values. Knowledge of this probability can aid in engineering decision-making to prevent damage to adjacent infrastructures. The proposed framework consists of five elements: (1) finite element method (FEM) for analyzing wall and ground responses in <b>a</b> <b>braced</b> excavation, (2) fuzzy set modeling of parameter uncertainty, (3) spatial averaging technique for handling spatial variability, (4) vertex method for processing fuzzy input through FEM model, and (5) interpretation of fuzzy output. The proposed framework is demonstrated through a well-documented case history. The results show the proposed framework is simple and effective for assessing the probability of serviceability failure in <b>a</b> <b>braced</b> excavation in <b>a</b> spatially random field. To focus on the proposed fuzzy FEM approach, {{the scope of this}} paper is limited to one-dimensional modeling of spatial variability with an assumed exponential autocorrelation function.
