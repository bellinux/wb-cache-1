40|$|The {{traffic signal}} {{is one of}} the most common control devices used to manage highway traffic. Operating them as {{isolated}} units does not exploit their usefulness fully. An advanced system, in which traffic signals at junctions at a close proximity are coordinated, enables a more efficient method of traffic control. This thesis presents the development of hardware and software for the Uniroad traffic signal controller, for interfacing it to the proposed <b>Advanced</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> <b>System</b> (A TCS) for Sri Lanka, and a technique to calculate traffic plans based on the Genetic Algorithm for the coordinated system. In hardware development, a communication interface and a general purpose input interface (GPIT) are designed and implemented for the traffic signal controller (TSC). These are used to monitor the performance and change traffic plans manually or through computer control. The GPII is also used to interface vehicle detectors, pedestrian pushbutton etc. to the TSC. The firmware platform of the TSC is developed to accommodate the requirements of both coordinated as well as individual systems. Synchronizing routines, temporary overrides and online time plan adjustments as well as error detecting and logging routines are introduced. A control and monitoring (C&M) software package is developed for the control center. Using this package, the operation of each traffic signal controller can be monitored or optimally adjusted as needed. A traffic plan calculator (TPC) is developed to calculate traffic plans needed for a set of coordinated traffic signal controllers. A new algorithm, based on well-known evolutionary algorithm, the Genetic Algorithm, was developed for TPC. The TPC provides an optimum set of traffic signal plans for a coordinated traffic signal system.

40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of the technical and institutional issues associated with the evaluation of the federally-sponsored Anaheim <b>Advanced</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> <b>System</b> Field Operations Test. The primary FOT objective was the implementation and performance evaluation of adaptive traffic signal control technologies including an existing second generation approach, SCOOT, and a 1. 5 generation control (1. 5 GC) approach under development. Also selected for implementation was a video traffic detection system (VTDS). The SCOOT evaluation was defined relative to existing, first generation UTCS-based control but using standard field detectorization rather than that normally associated with SCOOT. Furthermore, SCOOT was installed to operate in parallel to UTCS. The 1. 5 GC system was planned to be efficiently utilized to update baseline timing plans. The VTDS was planned for use as a low cost system detector for deployment in critical areas. Both SCOOT and the VTDS were implemented with some degree of success, with technical and institutional issues limiting expected performance. Technical issues which limited SCOOT performance included less than anticipated quality of existing communication and controller systems; corresponding institutional factors included inconsistent project management due to staff changes and delays due to contractual issues.

One area that is of particular interest is that of the analysis of Dynamic Traffic Management (DTM) of trains. The aim of DTM is to manage plan/timetable deviations from daily train operations effectively in order to improve overall performance of the train service. To perform this analysis two existing (legacy) systems, FRISO and TMS, have been connected via the High Level Architecture (HLA). FRISO is a train simulator that is used to investigate rail transport in the area of several (tens of) kilometers.

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{has become}} an increasing problem on major surface arterial roadways. Demand for accessibility to adjacent land uses yields increased vehicular turning movement activity at driveways and intersections. As turning and cross-road traffic volumes increase, the need for traffic signalization will eventually be warranted. When numerous, independently operating traffic signals are present on a given arterial roadway, adverse effects can result. First, continous movement along the arterials at a desirable speed may not be assured. Second, vehicular delay will increase because of the slower operating speeds and increased number of stops. Third, safety can be threatened as poor traffic flow (i. e. increased number of stops, etc.) may lead to potential vehicular conflict. Fourth, vehicle emissions may increase {{as a result of}} poor traffic progression and can have unfavorable consequences to the local air quality. Lastly, increased fuel consumption is possible as traffic waits along poorly timed arterials. Of the five effects mentioned, travel delay is the most conspicuous and readily measured. to offset these effects, <b>advanced</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> have been developed to effectively and efficiently coordinate traffic flow along an arterial roadways or throughtout an area. In this study, a review of the most current technolgies in <b>Advanced</b> <b>Traffic</b> Management Systems (ATMS) for surface arterial roadways was performed.

The application of ATCS in developing countries is unique because cities in developing countries face more severe transportation problems than those in developed countries and characterised by specific geometric and traffic local conditions, for examples: low road network densities with poor conditions, narrow lane width, poor lane discipline, and level of side friction in connection with on street parking and street vendor activities.

High technology built in a developed country can be successfully implemented in a developing country if the specific geometric and traffic conditions in the large cities and the local traffic behaviour are taken into account. By finding out the relationships between traffic performance measures and the significant variables, appropriate improvements of the performance of the ATCS in large city in developing country can be recommended.

The aim {{of this study is to}} identify charac-teristics of signalized intersections which need to be under ATCS. Field data were collected at 19 signalized intersections un-der ATCS surveillance and 10 streams related to the intersections, in Bandung Indonesia. Manual traffic counts, video came-ras, and floating car technique were used to collect the data during morning peak period (07 : 00 - 08 : 00 am), off peak periods (10 : 00 - 11 : 00 am), and afternoon peak period (04 : 30 - 05 : 30 pm). Measurements to determine the characteristics of signalized intersections are throughput per capacity at each leg intersection, number of queue at each leg intersection, and travel time at each stream. The results found that the application of ATCS is recommended to signalized intersections with characteristics of many leg intersections, located in CBD, closed distance to adjacent intersection and high side frictions. The findings of this study are very beneficial not only for Bandung but for other large cities in Indonesia that have similar local conditions.

The need for a new ATM arises from the overcrowding of large urban airports and the need to more efficiently handle larger numbers of aircraft, without building new runways. Recent technological advances, such as the availability of relatively inexpensive and fast real time computers both on board the aircraft and in the control tower, make a more <b>advanced</b> air <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> possible. The benefits from these technological advances are limited by today's Air <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC), a ground-based system which routes aircraft along predefined jet ways in the sky, allowing the aircraft very little autonomy in choosing their own routes. In this paper we propose a decentralized ATM framework, meaning that much of the current ATC functionality is moved on board each aircraft. Within this framework, we describe our work in on-board conflict resolution strategi [...] ...|$|R
