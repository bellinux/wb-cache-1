The second was its armament: weapons failure dogged this aircraft. The third weakness was its gunsights, which were inaccurate: that's why we closed in as much <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> and fired point blank." ...|$|E

Newey was quoted saying: [...] "So we photographed it going past, saw huge crease in exhaust, which usually means it will soon crack and the bodywork catch fire. [...] So we changed the engine mapping to keep the exhaust as cool <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>could,</b> even though it meant lost performance".|$|E

500|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of the drumming style implemented in recording the album is its adherence to human timing, as the tracks were mostly programmed mechanically during recording, therefore resulting in the album's intentional sloppiness. In a later interview, Questlove discussed the intention and purpose of including imperfection in the album's sound, stating [...] "we wanted to play as perfectly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>could,</b> but then deliberately insert the little glitch that makes it sound messed up. The idea was to sound disciplined, but with a total human feel." ...|$|E

One of Lennon's childhood treats was the garden party held each summer in Calderstones Park, near the home, where a Salvation Army band played.

Upon discovery of copies {{of the game in}} Sunsoft's headquarters in Japan, Gaijinworks' founder Victor Ireland said: [...] "I was blown away when I saw these.

We would use those same cards when figuring out stories for the series." [...] Later, Spotnitz noted that the cards were also in his handwriting [...] "because the prop guy couldn’t do it as well <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> because that’s really the way we did it. It’s a very emotional love story and it’s really about our love for these characters as writers". The writers eventually settled on the title of [...] "Milagro," [...] which means miracle in Spanish.|$|E
500|$|Espenson {{said that}} this was one of their most love-centered episodes; when they {{realized}} {{it was going to be}} airing near Valentine's Day, they decided to [...] "lean into" [...] this theme. Unusual for Once Upon a Time, the theme of this episode changed during the writing process. It was initially meant to center on Rumpelstiltskin choosing power over love. However, as Espenson went through drafts and discussed them with others, she decided that Rumpelstiltskin might think he is doing this, but really his actions are motivated by not believing that he is worthy of love at all. In the interest of time, Espenson was forced to edit out many plot points, including a failed escape attempt by Belle. Despite this, she sought to trim down more time from the Storybrooke scenes and [...] "preserve as much <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> of the fairy tale side," [...] as the Belle-Rumpelstiltskin relationship was a love story that needed time to grow in order to be believable.|$|E
500|$|A soldier {{under the}} command of Colonel Garnons Williams wrote an account of his {{commanding}} officer's death, which puts the date of his death as 27 September. Col Garnons Williams was in temporary command of the 12th Royal Fusiliers when on 25 September he led his battalion in an attack on German trenches. However, the flanks were exposed and on 27 September, Garnons Williams gave the order to retreat. He was at that moment shot in the head from a house nearby. The soldier who gave the account said: [...] "I was very sorry for him, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not have had a better, braver officer. He was with us {{all the time in the}} front trench, and looked after us as well as he could; no man could have done better. Nobody could get back to him." [...] The following evening, the battalion was relieved, Garnons Williams being declared officially wounded and missing in action, unofficially reported killed.|$|E

500|$|After 1974, Harrison {{no longer}} wrote songs as {{obviously}} Krishna-devotional as [...] "It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)", although {{he returned to}} recording bhajans intermittently, with songs such as [...] "Dear One" [...] in 1976 and [...] "Life Itself, released in 1981. In his book The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Peter Lavezzoli writes that following Dark Horse and the [...] "ill-fated 1974 tour", Harrison [...] "continued to infuse his work with an implicit spirituality that rarely manifested on the surface". Speaking to ISKCON devotee Mukunda Goswami in 1982, Harrison said: Back in the sixties, whatever we were all getting into, we tended to broadcast it as loud <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>could.</b> I had had certain realizations and went through a period where I was so thrilled about my discoveries and realizations that I wanted to shout and tell it to everybody.

500|$|Pepys went {{again on}} the river {{in the early evening}} with his wife and some friends, [...] "and to the fire up and down, it still encreasing". They ordered the boatman to go [...] "so near the fire <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> for smoke; and all over the Thames, with one's face in the wind, you were almost burned with a shower of firedrops". When the [...] "firedrops" [...] became unbearable, the party went on to an alehouse on the South Bank and stayed there till {{darkness}} came and they could see the fire on London Bridge and across the river, [...] "as only one entire arch of fire from this {{to the other side of}} the bridge, and in a bow up the hill for an arch of above a mile long: it made me weep to see it". Pepys described this arch of fire as [...] "a bow with God's arrow in it with a shining point".|$|E
500|$|Under the {{supervision}} of the management team, the Monks conducted extensive rehearsals with a focus on gritty, rhythmically oriented music. The band equipped themselves with new instruments and hardware to achieve that goal: a Maestro fuzz box (and eventually a wah-wah pedal) for Burger, a floor tom for Johnston, and a six-string banjo for Day, the latter of which offered a disorienting counter-rhythm to the bass section. Shaw explained that the group's motivation was to possess [...] "high rhythm and high energy". He elaborated further, saying [...] "The idea of it was to get as much 'beat' out of it <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>could.</b> As much 'bam-bam-bam-bam' on the beat or whatever. The only time cymbals would be used would be for accent. If anyone wasn't contributing towards rhythm, then it wasn't part of the Monks sound". However, the band's transformation into the Monks was painstakingly slow, taking the group nearly a year of trial-and-error before they were confident enough to return to the studio.|$|E

500|$|The whole {{song was}} written without that main sample; {{it was a}} last-minute thing. The song had kind {{of a lot of}} R music in it. And Kanye gave marching orders of [...] "Take out {{anything}} you want, but don't add. Just take away." [...] Like, [...] "OK." [...] And before that, we listened to the sample together and thought, [...] "Hmm, maybe there's a way to integrate this into the song." [...] So we started by getting the sample to work in the song, and then taking out as much stuff <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>could,</b> and then in the chorus reducing what was this whole musical thing, just this sort of one ugly, distorted bass note. I was thinking like Alan Vega and Suicide, that kind of noise-synth minimal vibe. So that was the idea behind the chorus: Take it from this sort of R thing and turn it into this kind of post-punk, edge thing. And the lyrics he wrote were so good and funny. It just turned into a really good record. The sample is so good.|$|E
500|$|The I EP {{contains}} a single, 21-minute song of complex arrangements {{and was a}} hint of the forthcoming album, 2005's Catch Thirtythree. The EP, which was never played live by the band, was written and recorded during jamming sessions of Haake and Thordendal. On Catch Thirtythree, Meshuggah again used eight-string guitars, but utilized programmed drums for the first time also for the release, with the exception of two songs from 2001's compilation Rare Trax. The album was self-produced by the band and was recorded at the studio that Meshuggah shares with Clawfinger. Hagström notes, [...] "The eight-strings really have given us a whole new musical vocabulary to work with. Part of it is the restrictions they impose: you really can't play power chords with them; the sound just turns to mush. Instead, we concentrated on coming up with really unusual single-note parts, new tunings and chord voicings. We wanted to get as far away from any kind of conventions and traditions <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> on the album, so the guitars worked out beautifully." ...|$|E

Eight roving camera teams—each team including a lighting cameraman, an assistant, a lighting electrician and a set dresser to deal with any art department issues—worked with the animators to set up shots. Each camera team had a [...] "lighting station" [...] workstation—comprising an Apple G4 computer and a monitor to assist in checking lighting and framing—to view TIFF file versions of the camera's images. Once a shot was approved, the computer was removed and the animators were left to shoot the scene using their still camera and [...] "grabber" [...] computer/camera system to check their work. The film's story department head Jeffrey Lynch explained that the scenes were developed initially from storyboards created by a team, saying: [...] "We shot {{as close to a}} 1:1 film ratio [...] <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> because {{there was no time for}} reshoots. We did most of our experimentation in the storyboard process—as many ways as needed—to get the scene how we wanted it. There was no coverage, as there would be for a live-action film." ...|$|E
