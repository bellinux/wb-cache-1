50|$|Due to {{the lower}} {{atmospheric}} pressure at high <b>altitudes,</b> the air pressure within the breathing system must be lower {{than it would be}} at low <b>altitudes</b> in order for inhalation to occur.

40|$|The {{current study}} was to {{investigate}} the features of hospitalized patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) at different <b>altitudes.</b> The correlation between SLE activity and altitud-inal variations was also explored. Medical records of 1029 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Activity of SLE in each organ system was recorded using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). There was no significant correlation between SLE activity and <b>altitudes</b> (r 0. 003, p 0. 159). Age at onset for SLE patients at high <b>altitudes</b> was significantly younger than that at low and moderate <b>altitudes</b> (p 0. 022 and p 0. 004, respectively). Age at SLE admission at low <b>altitudes</b> was significant older than those at moderate and high <b>altitudes</b> (p 0. 011 and p< 0. 001, respectively). Patients at high alti-tudes had shorter duration from disease onset to admission than those at moderate <b>altitudes</b> (p 0. 009). Incidence of Sm antibodies-positive for resident patients at high <b>altitudes</b> was 36. 4 %, which were higher than that at moderate <b>altitudes</b> (p 0. 003). We found increasing trends of CNS activity in active patients; immunological and renal activities in inactive patients were correlated with elevated <b>altitudes</b> (p 0. 024, p 0. 004, p 0. 005), while arthritis scores in active patients showed the tendency of decreasing with the rise of elevatio...|$|R

It was assumed that D. unipectinata moved from low to high <b>altitudes</b> in June while D. oshimai, D. suzukii and D. subpulchrella in July. Migration of D. unipectinata is considered {{as a means to}} avoid summer heat or exploit early-summer resources at high <b>altitudes.</b> On the other hand, D. oshimai, D. suzukii and D. subpulchrella have the capacity to pass the summer at low <b>altitudes,</b> and therefore their migration is assumed as a means to escape from resource-poor conditions in summer at low <b>altitudes</b> or exploit resources at high <b>altitudes.</b> The generalist species, D. lutescens, D. rufa, D. auraria, D. biauraria and D. sternopleuralis, would not perform such extensive movements between low and high <b>altitudes.</b> They may pass the summer at low or mid <b>altitudes</b> depending on accidentally fallen immature fruits and/or some other resources such as decayed leaves...|$|R
