50|$|Annona glabra is a {{tropical}} fruit {{tree in the}} family Annonaceae, in the same genus as the Soursop and Cherimoya. Common names include pond apple, <b>alligator</b> <b>apple</b> (so called because American alligators often eat the fruit), swamp apple, corkwood, bobwood, and monkey apple. The tree is native to Florida in the United States, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and West Africa. It is common in the Everglades. The A. glabra tree is considered an invasive species in Sri Lanka and Australia. It grows in swamps, is tolerant of saltwater, and cannot grow in dry soil.|$|E

Every one laughed {{when he or she}} spoke, and every one {{standing}} near joined freely in the conversation and laughed too. Frank was delighted with the display of fruit in the market, which is probably unequaled in the world. Great piles there were of delicious big oranges, green but perfectly sweet, and of equally refreshing little green limes; pineapples and bananas, green, yellow, and red, guava, and custard <b>apples,</b> <b>alligator</b> pears, melons, and sour sops, and many other native fruits.|$|R
40|$|It is {{uncertain}} how climate change will impact hydrologic drivers of wildlife population dynamics in freshwater wetlands of the Florida Everglades, {{or how to}} accommodate th{{is uncertain}}ty in restoration decisions. Using projections of climate scenarios for the year 2060, we evaluated how several possible futures could affect wildlife populations (wading birds, fish, <b>alligators,</b> native <b>apple</b> snails, amphibians, threatened and invasive species) across the Everglades landscape and inform planning already underway. We used data collected from prior research and monitoring to parameterize our wildlife population models. Hydrologic data were simulated using a spatially explicit, regional-scale model. Our scenario evaluations show that expected changes in temperature, precipitation, and sea level could significantly alter important ecological functions. All of our wildlife indicators were negatively affected by scenarios with less rainfall and more evapotranspiration. Under such scenarios, habitat suitability was substantially reduced for iconic animals such as wading birds and alligators. Conversely, the increased rainfall scenario benefited aquatic prey productivity and apex predators. Cascading impacts on non-native species is speculative, but increasing temperatures could increase the time between cold events that currently limit expansion and abundance of non-native fishes, amphibians, and reptiles with natural ranges in the tropics. This scenario planning framework underscored the benefits of proceeding with Everglades restoration plans that capture and clean more freshwater {{with the potential to}} mitigate rainfall loss and postpone impacts of sea level rise...|$|R
40|$|Annona glabra, {{commonly}} known as Pond apple or <b>Alligator</b> <b>apple</b> belonging to the family Annonaceae is native to Florida, USA, is now a common invasive in the wetlands of Kannur district of Kerala, India. Kuttikkol from the Taliparamba municipality of Kannur district was selected for our study. The morphological features, the soil and water of the habitat were studied. The pond apple shows morphological peculiarities and its fruit carries up to 300 seeds and all are viable. The rapid germination and susceptibility make this {{to survive in the}} salty wetlands. The soil and water is nutrient rich, favors growth and its canopy reduces light and suppresses the growth of other economically important plants...|$|E
