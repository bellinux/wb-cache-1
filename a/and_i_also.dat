25|$|The LeFlore County registrar, Cornelia Jordan, after {{conducting}} {{an investigation into}} Johnson's death for the state director of vital statistics, R. N. Whitfield, wrote on Johnson's death certificate: I talked with the white man on whose place this negro died <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> talked with a negro woman on the place. The plantation owner said the negro man, seemingly about 26 years old, came from Tunica {{two or three weeks}} before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation. He stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton. The white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him. He was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county. The plantation owner said it was his opinion that the man died of syphilis.|$|E

500|$|While this {{mixing of}} campaigns was done without the {{knowledge}} of the members of Fall Out Boy, Wentz did post an acknowledgement on August 22, when CFOB again [...] "hijacked" [...] Decaydance Records website. Decaydance act The Cab began performing with [...] "Citizens for Our Betterment" [...] written on the group's instruments. Finally, on August 26, a blog post of a press release was made on the band's FriendsOrEnemies.com page; it announced Folie à Deux as the title of the upcoming album, due for release on November 4. Wentz said of the endeavor [...] "To me, this is not a marketing campaign. It is a way to cause excitement about your art and have people earn it and understand it...I don't believe the full campaign has begun, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> believe people are taking over the ship in a truly viral way.

500|$|Francis II became king {{at the age}} of fifteen. In {{what has}} been called a coup d'état, the Cardinal of Lorraine and the Duke of Guise—whose niece, Mary, Queen of Scots, had married Francis the year before—seized power the day after Henry II's death and quickly moved {{themselves}} into the Louvre Palace with the young couple. The English ambassador reported a few days later that [...] "the house of Guise ruleth and doth all about the French king". For the moment, Catherine worked with the Guises out of necessity. She was not strictly entitled to a role in Francis's government, because he was deemed old enough to rule for himself. Nevertheless, all his official acts began with the words: [...] "This being the good pleasure of the Queen, my lady-mother, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> approving of every opinion that she holdeth, am content and command that..." [...] Catherine did not hesitate to exploit her new authority. One of her first acts was to force Diane de Poitiers to hand over the crown jewels and return the Château de Chenonceau to the crown. She later did her best to efface or outdo Diane's building work there.|$|E
500|$|There are {{contradictory}} claims {{as to who}} was {{the leader}} of the coup and had managed its execution, coming from Simović, Mirković, and Major Živan Knežević. Mirković claimed sole credit immediately after the coup and stated on its tenth anniversary that: [...] "Only after I had informed General [...] about my idea and he had accepted it did I make the decision to undertake the planned revolt. I made the decision myself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> carried out the whole organization. I made the decision as to when the revolt would take place." [...] It is likely that he had been a planning a coup since 1937 when an Italo-Yugoslav pact was signed. King Peter later credited simply the [...] "younger and middle ranks [...] of the Yugoslav army" [...] for the coup in a speech on 17 December 1941. Simović's response was published posthumously, he claimed that he [...] "stood {{in the center of the}} whole undertaking" [...] and [...] "personally engaged his assistant Brigadier General Bora Mirković for the action". Tomasevich considers Mirković's account to be the more credible of the two, and points out it is corroborated from several sources, both Allied and Axis. The matter would play a role in the factionalism that would divide the soon-to-be Yugoslav government-in-exile during the war.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, when I decided to come here I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It was great to win there before <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> had one of my best performances for Liverpool. There's a great buzz around the place; we know that the club expects to win trophies, and we're in a position to deliver that later this week." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Orwell {{was in the}} {{sanatorium}} in Kent, his wife's friend Lydia Jackson visited. He {{invited her}} for a walk {{and out of sight}} [...] "an awkward situation arose." [...] Jackson was to be the most critical of Orwell's marriage to Eileen O'Shaughnessy, but their later correspondence hints at a complicity. Eileen at the time was more concerned about Orwell's closeness to Brenda Salkield. Orwell had an affair with his secretary at Tribune which caused Eileen much distress, and others have been mooted. In a letter to Ann Popham he wrote: [...] "I was sometimes unfaithful to Eileen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> treated her badly, and I think she treated me badly, too, at times, but it was a real marriage, {{in the sense that we}} had been through awful struggles together and she understood all about my work, etc." [...] Similarly he suggested to Celia Kirwan that they had both been unfaithful.
