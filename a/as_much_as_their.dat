25|$|Women tend to {{earn less}} than men in almost all industries, {{including}} government and academia. Women {{are less likely to}} be hired in highest-paid positions. The data showing the differences in salaries, ranks, and overall success between the genders is often claimed to be a result of women's lack of professional experience. The rate of women's professional achievement is increasing. In 1996, the salaries for women in professional fields increased from 85% to 95% relative to men with similar skills and jobs. Young women between the age of 27 and 33 earned 98%, nearly <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> male peers. In the total workforce of the United States, women earn 74% <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> male counterparts (in the 1970s they made 59% <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> male counterparts).|$|E

Although subordinate chicks beg just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> dominant siblings, the older chicks are able to divert the parents' attention to themselves, as their large size and conspicuousness serve as more effective stimuli.|$|E

25|$|Inspiration for Killigrew’s poetry {{came from}} her {{knowledge}} of Greek myths and Biblical proverbs {{as well as from}} some very influential female poets who lived during the Restoration period: Katherine Philips and Anne Finch (also a maid to Mary of Modena {{at the same time as}} Killigrew). Mary of Modena encouraged the French tradition of precieuses (patrician women intellectuals) which pressed women’s participation in theatre, literature, and music. In effect, Killigrew was surrounded with a poetic feminist inspiration on a daily basis in Court: she was encompassed by strong intelligent women who encouraged her writing career <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> own.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the portraits}} were {{commissioned}} to the artists directly by Padre Martini. The painters drew {{the features of}} the musicians from engravings of the time. In reality, he wasn't interested in the artistic worth of the paintings <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> plausible resemblance to the model. He was also more interested in whether they were in harmony with his century's interest in the physiognomic reading of faces with the intention of giving iconographic testimony of the people bonded by one common denominator – music. It was also important that the paintings had a direct relationship with his Library.|$|E
25|$|Timothy {{wrote to}} Eleazar Wheelock, founder of Dartmouth College, in March 1773, {{regarding}} {{the admission of}} three boys to Moor's Indian Charity School, which was a school for training Native Americans to be missionaries themselves. In June, the Stockbridges petitioned that Timothy be allowed to sell <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> land as was required, being that their tribe was greatly in debt, and some members imprisoned on those grounds. Their petition was again granted. In December, Timothy wrote to Governor William Tryon, requesting compensation for those Stockbridge Native Americans who had fought for the British during the French and American War. Shortly before his death, Timothy was chosen {{a member of the}} Governor's Council by mandamus of King George III. However, with his loyalty lying with the colonies in the days preceding the Revolutionary War, he declined.|$|E

25|$|Organised retail {{will need}} workers. Walmart employs 1.4 {{million people in}} United States alone. With United States {{population}} of about 300 million, and India's population of about 1200 million, if Walmart-like retail companies were to expand in India <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> presence in the United States, and the staffing level in Indian stores kept {{at the same level}} as in the United States stores, Walmart alone would employ 5.6 million Indian citizens. Walmart has a 6.5% market share of the total United States retail. Adjusted for this market share, the expected jobs in future Indian organised retail would total over 85 million. In addition, millions of additional jobs will be created during the building of and the maintenance of retail stores, roads, cold storage centers, software industry, electronic cash registers and other retail supporting organisations. Instead of job losses, retail reforms are likely to be massive boost to Indian job availability.|$|E
25|$|Training was {{extended}} {{from two years}} to four, with the resulting need for more accommodation for cadets. A second cadet establishment was constructed at Osborne on the Isle of Wight {{for the first two}} years, with the last two remaining at Dartmouth. All cadets now received an education in science and technology as it related to life on board a ship as well as navigation and seamanship. Those who went on to be command officers would now have the benefit of improved understanding of their ships while those who became engineers would be better equipped for command. Physical education and sport were to be taught, not only {{for the benefit of the}} cadets but also for the future training of ships' crews which were expected to produce sporting teams on good-will visits in foreign ports. Entrance by examination, which biased the intake to those who could obtain special tuition, was replaced with an interview committee tasked with determining the general knowledge of candidates and their reaction to the questions <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> answers. After the four years, cadets were posted to special training ships for final practical experience before being posted to real command positions. The results of the final examination affected the seniority allotted to each cadet and his chance of future early promotion.|$|E

On 1 December 1976, {{the band and}} members of the Bromley Contingent created a storm of publicity by swearing during an early evening live broadcast of Thames Television's Today programme. Appearing as last-minute replacements for fellow EMI artists Queen, the band and their entourage were offered drinks as they waited to go on air. During the interview, Steve Jones said the band had [...] "fucking spent" [...] its label advance and Rotten twice used the word [...] "shit". Host Bill Grundy, who claimed to be as drunk as his interviewees, engaged in repartee with Siouxsie Sioux, who declared that she had [...] "always wanted to meet" [...] him. Grundy responded, [...] "Did you really? We'll meet afterwards, shall we?" [...] This prompted the following exchange between Jones and the host: ...|$|E

500|$|Punk rock had {{a direct}} {{influence}} in the birth of New wave and new wave of British heavy metal and that music was still popular when the band was formed. Moreover, both Denise Dufort and Gil Weston had played in punk bands before joining Girlschool. [...] "We're both too heavy to be New Wave and too punk to be a heavy metal band", McAuliffe explained to Robbi Millar of Sounds in 1980. The raw and almost live recording sound of their first two Vic Maile produced albums represents perfectly the core music of the band in the years from 1979 to 1982, which were the most successful for Girlschool. The combination of metal and punk was {{a large part of}} the sound which also propelled Motörhead to notoriety and chart success in the early 80s in the United Kingdom. This sound, the tours and recordings made together with Lemmy’s band, the girls’ denim and leather look, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> rowdy and alcohol driven off-stage behaviour soon gained Girlschool the moniker of 'sisters of Motörhead', which they are often still identified with today. Their close association with Motörhead at the beginning of Girlschool's career helped achieve their early success.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{political}} impacts of the massive infusion into the South Vietnamese economy was to expand the urban middle-class and ease {{the pressure on the}} government to collect taxes. This was because the government had set high import duties, which were effectively 50% of the cut-price exchange rate used under the CIP; these funds were also part of normal revenue, and were not subject to American oversight, unlike the proceeds of the counterpart fund. As a result of the proceeds of the import duty, income tax was very low, and without the progressive income tax rate in most countries, the upper-class were not affected by taxation <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> peers in other nations, and thus supported Diem strongly. The effective income taxation rate was no more than 5%, and the South Vietnamese president privately told an adviser from the Michigan State University Group that he was happy that the CIP had allowed him to build a large support base among the newly created middle and upper class. American economic aid administrators were also aware {{of the effects of the}} CIP on urban political support for Diem and his successors. They were aware that the CIP had not been yielding substantial gains in economic development, and noted this in their reports, but said that the program should be continued regardless, as it was effective in enriching the urban middle class and ensuring their political support, thereby gaining loyalty from military officers, business leaders and public servants. A 1959 report concluded that if the CIP was absent or diluted to equilibrium economic levels, the resulting fall in living standards would create [...] "serious political problems" [...] due to erosion of the government's support among the urban minority.|$|E
500|$|To help {{train the}} dog playing Vincent for the episode's needed scenes, Madison {{was given the}} fake arm to take home and play with; when finally brought on the set, the crew had {{difficulty}} shooting her because Madison would bring and drop off the arm slightly differently each time, causing trouble recreating the same camera angles. Actor Daniel Dae Kim described their scenes with the beer in the DVD special features, [...] "The comedic scenes with Josh were {{so much fun to}} play because it was a lighter side. A nice change of pace." [...] Like their characters, the actors had not been in scenes together in a while, so Dae Kim thought it [...] "was fun to catch up and have fun in the process". The episode featured Hurley driving a bus down a hill. To create this scene, Garcia had to drive the bus down a small hill [...] "very stead" [...] to ensure the cameraman could record it all; towards the end however, they told Garcia to just [...] "go for it", allowing him to [...] "cut loose a little". For the close-up shots of Garcia and Dominic Monaghan, the production crew would shake the bus to simulate driving, and brush various pieces of foliage across the windshield to make it seem the bus was hitting bushes or trees. A stunt double standing in for Garcia performed the largest hill in the drive down; they were unable to rehearse due to getting rained out, so their first rehearsal was done on film. Dae Kim commented that [...] "it was just great to have as much fun on camera as we do off camera", {{and that there was no}} real acting that day, as they were all enjoying themselves <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> characters. The Volkswagen campus van — still in operating condition — along with Hurley's Camaro, were later auctioned off with other Lost props and costumes at the Santa Monica Airport in 2010.|$|E

If the card issuer charges 15% on money lent to users, and it costs 5% to borrow the money to lend, and the balance sits with the cardholder for a year, the issuer earns 10% on the loan.

Marszalek qualified the work of guitarist McGeoch as [...] "a seamless beauty", and wrote that [...] "Siouxsie's voice achieves a sense of strength and maturity".
