25|$|Author Ichiei Ishibumi {{mentioned}} that Rias was {{developed into a}} second lead character and heroine, and Asia to be the second heroine, as well as Issei the protagonist, in the afterword of the first light novel. Some of his characters are loosely referenced from the Bible, non-fiction books, and mythology, and he created a world with a war being waged between three major factions (angels, devils, and fallen angels) with Rias being a devil. In Volume 5 of the light novels, Ishibumi writes that he likes to pair the main characters: Rias and Akeno are the big sister duo, Asia and Xenovia are the church-related duo who become friends, Gasper and Koneko are the young first-years, and Issei and Yuto <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys.</b>|$|E
500|$|Continuing his {{services}} from the prior season, Dana Gonzales oversaw {{production of the}} show's second season. The cinematographer took cues from William Eggleston to develop a retro visual palette. To achieve this quality, Gonzales relied on vintage practical lighting technology, and captured scenes with an Arri ALEXA camera, retrofitted with vintage Cooke lenses. In one section of Calgary where they were filming, production staff replaced each sodium-lamp street light with tungsten light bulbs, creating an ambience that [...] "pulls the audience into the world when the story takes place". Also, once Hawley analyzed the 1968 thriller film The Boston Strangler, split screen effects were employed to help streamline the narrative during transitions. Gonzales said: [...] "We felt that split-screen would be an incredible way to track all these characters and locations within the episode: Where's the Gerhardt family? Where <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> from Kansas City? Where's Peggy? Where's Ed?" ...|$|E
500|$|On April 5, 1967, {{the same}} day the Apollo1 {{investigation}} released its report on the fire, Armstrong assembled with 17 other astronauts for a meeting with Deke Slayton. The first thing Slayton said was, [...] "The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> in this room." [...] According to Eugene Cernan, Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it came as no surprise—the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned to be a medium Earth orbit test of the Lunar Module-Command/Service Module combination. After design and manufacturing delays in the Lunar Module (LM), Apollo9 and Apollo8 swapped crews. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong would command Apollo11.|$|E

My answer was simple: We are there in those neighborhoods because that's where people are dying. These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> we lock up {{because they are the}} predators choking off the life of a community.
