Results show that, when the concentration of NaClO 2 in scrubbing solution is higher than 10  mM, a complete removal of NO can be achieved during the cyclic scrubbing process. The breakthrough time for seawater with 15  mM NaClO 2 is enhanced by 34.3  % compared with that for NaClO 2 freshwater. The extension of the breakthrough time for NaClO 2 seawater is mainly ascribed to the improved utilization of NaClO 2 in the solution.

40|$|Amines show great {{potential}} for protecting steam-water cycles against corrosion, but their thermal stability is limited and <b>acidic</b> <b>decomposition</b> products are a concern due to increased corrosion risk. In this study, morpholine (hydro) thermolysis is simulated at boiler (352 degrees C, 17. 5 MPa) and superheater (490 degrees C, 17. 5 MPa) conditions with an experimental stainless steel flow reactor. Thermolysis under superheater conditions was more rapid than hydrothermolysis under boiler conditions. Organic acid anion decomposition products increased linearly over time, while the thermal decomposition of morpholine followed first order kinetics. Further experiments under superheater conditions were performed at 470, 490 and 510 degrees C, with pressures of 9. 5, 13. 5, and 17. 5 MPa. With the kinetic rate constants for morpholine thermolysis in dry steam derived empirically, the activation energy of the decomposition reaction was 160. 0 (+/- 2. 0) kJ/mol, the pre-exponential factor was e(21. 7 (+/- 0. 66)) s(- 1), and the activation volume was 896 (+/- 36) cm(3) /mol.

In this study, metal catalysis of amine thermolysis caused by oxides on the inner surface of superheater tubes has been investigated by using a flow reactor and metal tubes of varying sizes and elemental composition. The kinetics of morpholine and ethanolamine thermolysis decreased as the tube size increased. The relationship between the S:V ratio and the degradation rate constant k was linear.

Organic acid anion production was weakly related to the amine structure, temperature, and tube diameter but strongly related to the metal oxide composition, with formate and acetate altering as the dominant organic acid anion.

TiO 2 P 25 {{was determined to}} be the most favorable catalyst when compared to TiO 2 Hombikat or Pt-promoted P 25 (0. 5 % Pt/P 25). For all catalysts, a strong substrate specificity was observed when simultaneous decomposition was attempted at neutral pH or <b>acidic</b> conditions: MO <b>decomposition</b> was largely preferred over decomposition of atrazine. For TiO 2 P 25, several process parameters were varied (catalyst loading, MO initial concentration, pH) to determine that the cause of this observation is preferential adsorption. Atrazine decomposition was no longer inhibited by MO at (i) large catalyst concentrations, (ii) at a low MO over atrazine ration, and (iii) at basic conditions (pH 11). Apparently the surface charge of illuminated TiO 2 significantly affects the degradation behavior of contaminants when present in mixtures. Surface specificity is not limited to a combination of MO and atrazine, but for P 25, this is also shown to occur in decomposition of a mixture of MO and acid orange (AO), compounds with similarity in molecular structure.

Theophilus mentions the addition of urine to the mix. With heating, the silver reacts with the salt to form silver chloride which is removed leaving a purified gold behind. Conditions needed for this process are below 1000°C as the gold should not melt. Silver can be recovered by smelting the debris. Heating can take 24 hours. Hoover and Hoover explains the process thus: under heating salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) decomposes in the presence of silica and alumina (from the brick dust or clay) to produce hydrochloric acid and also some chlorine.

The study was carried out to assess and evaluate the appropriateness of the location and operation of this landfill, to determine the composition of the solid waste dumped at the landfill and the extent of contamination of the landfill leachate to the surrounding environment (water and soil). Field measurements were carried out to determine the concentration of nutrients and metals in the landfill leachate, water and soil using UV spectrometer and Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. The landfill is not well located as it is close to a residential area, school and cattle farms. It is also located on a slope which ends in an ecologically important wetland, the Densu wetland.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the possibility of identifying and quantifying atmospheric carbonate carbon (CC) by thermal-optical analysis. Three different temperature protocols, two modified NIOSH-like protocols (RT-QUARTZ- 840 and RT-QUARTZ- 700), and the EUSAAR 2 protocol were tested on filter samples containing known amounts of CC with the semi-continuous Sunset analyzer. Carbonate was quantified by the manual integration of the sharp peak appeared at the maximum temperature step of the inert mode. High recoveries of CC were achieved by all the thermal protocols. Using the EUSAAR 2 thermal protocol, more than 95 % of CC evolved as OC during the maximum temperature step in inert atmosphere for CC amounts up to 56 μg. Using the RT-QUARTZ- 840 protocol specifically developed for on-line analyses, CC completely evolves as OC during the maximum temperature step in the inert node, regardless of the CC concentration. However, the quantification of CC by the RT-QUARTZ- 840 protocol suitable for the semi-continuous analyzer implies {{a high level of}} uncertainty (manual integration, residual contribution of organic carbon). Therefore, it is advisable to determine CC with an independent method (e. g. by <b>acidic</b> <b>decomposition</b> of CO 2 − 3 and subsequent detection of CO 2) when other sample aliquots are available. The comparison of the peak integration method with the direct determination of the CC sample content by acidic CO 2 release showed that the peak integration method provides always higher CC concentrations of about 33 %. Nevertheless, the determination of CC with the RT-QUARTZ- 840 protocol may be considered in cases where on line monitoring instruments are used and for areas Correspondence to: A. Karanasiou (angeliki. karanasiou@idaea. csic. es) where CC concentrations are expected to be significant e. g. Southern European countries. This case study suggests that users of the semi continuous Sunset analyzer can manually integrate the sharp peak (if present) at the maximum temperature step of the He mode (between 128 – 130 and 160 – 165 s when using the RT-QUARTZ- 840 protocol) and calculate the CC concentration though with a rather high error.

40|$|Boiler {{feedwater}} {{and steam}} {{have to be}} of high purity, because of the susceptibility of the steam-water cycle to corrosion. Organic contaminants break down in boilers by hydrothermolysis, leading {{to the formation of}} organic acid anions, which are suspected to cause corrosion of steam-water cycle components. The impact and behavior of organic decomposition products in the steam-water cycle are not well understood. While guidelines for organic contaminants are becoming stricter, organic treatment chemicals are gaining popularity. Some alkalizing amines show potential for protecting steam-water cycles against corrosion, but their thermal stability is limited and <b>acidic</b> <b>decomposition</b> products are a concern. There are no official guidelines for the application of alkalizing amines in fossil-fired plants, because their thermal stability in the hottest sections of the plant is unknown. This thesis aims to contribute to well-founded guidelines for organic contamination and amine application in steam-water cycles to facilitate effective water treatment and chemical dosing. It does so by investigating the thermal decomposition of organic contaminants and treatment chemicals and using results to conduct corrosion experiments. To investigate hydrothermal reactions both batch and continuous flow reactors were tested, and it was concluded that the latter are better at investigating (hydro) thermolysis of organic treatment chemicals. A flow reactor gives precise control over retention time, temperature and pressure and these parameters can be changed much faster than with a batch reactor. The flow reactor was the basis for virtually all thermal stability and decomposition experiments described in this thesis. It was found that lower heating rates give more organic acid anions as degradation products of organic carbon, both in quantity and species variety. Thermal stability of the decomposition products determines which of these products is most prevalent. As boiler temperature increased, acetate became the dominant degradation product, due to its higher thermal stability. Shorter retention times led to more variety and quantity of organic acid anions, {{due to a lack of}} time for the thermally less stable ones to degrade. The absence of oxygen increased the thermal stability of decomposition products. The (hydro) thermolysis of monoethylene glycol and slurry oil produced up to a few hundred ppb acetate and formate. The (hydro) thermolysis of polyethylene glycol produced a high variety and quantity of organic acid anions, that could only partially be determined to be in the lower ppm range. The (hydro) thermolysis of the water dissolvable fraction of gasoil, naphtha and hydro wax did not lead to an increase in organic acid anions. Methyl ethyl ketoxime thermally degraded into several organic acid anions and nitrite in the higher ppb or lower ppm range. By using the flow reactor to investigate amine thermal stability, it was concluded that thermolysis under superheater conditions was more rapid than hydrothermolysis under boiler conditions. Anionic decomposition products increased linearly over time, while the thermal decomposition of morpholine followed first order kinetics. Metal catalysis of amine thermolysis caused by oxides on the inner surface of superheater tubes was investigated by using varying sizes and elemental composition. Kinetics of morpholine and ethanolamine thermolysis decreased as the tube size increased. The relation between the surface:volume ratio and the degradation rate constant was linear. Although results varied between the two applied tubing materials, there is no consistent trend that can link thermolysis kinetics to tube wall composition. The thermolysis of five alkalizing amines and two organic acids was comprehensively tested at superheater conditions. Morpholine, ethanolamine, cyclohexylamine, dimethylamine, 3 -methoxypropylamine and acetic acid were shown to undergo thermolysis according to first order kinetics. The activation energy, prefactor and activation volume were obtained from the experimental data for all investigated amines. Dimethylamine did not fully degrade, in spite of longer retention times being applied, suggesting synthesis may occur. Formic acid is very unstable under steam water cycle conditions. It is still found in high temperature and pressure steam-water cycles, though, and therefore it could be hypothesized that it is synthesized in the condensing stages. Acetic acid has higher thermal stability than all other tested compounds and is therefore the dominant organic acid anion at high temperatures. Cationic degradation products were ammonia and some amines, meaning that the complete thermolysis of an amine does not necessarily lead to acidic conditions, as the formed ammonia also provides protection. A model was constructed to predict the thermal stability of the amines in steam-water cycle. More plant data is necessary to fully validate the model. Runs conducted with an experimental two-phase flow-accelerated corrosion loop showed a linear relation between liquid film pH and obtained corrosion rates for the same steam quality. The tested steam quality was not high enough to create the conditions in which ammonia provides insufficient protection against acetic acid, but expanding the liquid film pH model to higher steam qualities does give an idea of the dangers of high acetate concentrations in a steam-water cycle. The models for calculating the pH of the liquid film in two-phase flow and amine thermolysis (if validated) could be connected to assess if alkalizing amine application is recommended for a specific steam-water cycle. In general, it can be concluded from the results that ethanolamine provides better protection against two-phase flow-accelerated corrosion in the presence of organic acid anions, so there is a maximum superheater temperature for each amine at which it can be applied. When ammonia is the only volatile treatment chemical protecting the steam-water cycle, organic acid anions in the plant should be reduced until theoretical pH drop of the two-phase liquid film is acceptable.

40|$|La présence de métaux dans les boues municipales demeure l'obstacle majeure à leur {{valorisation}} comme fertilisant agricole ou forestier. L'utilisation des boues en milieu forestier diminue certes les risques de contamination de la chaîne alimentaire humaine. Cependant, nos connaissances sur le comportement à long terme des métaux ajoutés aux sols forestiers sont encore très limitées. Le risque de lessivage des métaux vers les écosystèmes aquatiques situés en aval des zones traitées doit être évalué. Cet article propose une comparaison des risques de contamination de l'eau selon que l'application des boues s'effectue en forêt ou en milieu agricole. Les concentrations de métaux dans les boues municipales, leurs formes et leur mobilité dans les sols amendés sont passées en revue. Et finalement, les normes québécoises qui ont été établies pour protéger le milieu récepteur contre les métaux présents dans les boues sont comparées à celles recommandées par l'U. S. EPA. The {{presence of}} metals in municipal sewage sludge {{is still a}} major obstacle to their land application. Forest land application of sludge reduces the possibility of metals entering the human food chain. Present knowledge of their long-term behavior in forest soil is however limited. The risk of metals leaching to the aquatic ecosystem situated downstream from treated zone must be evaluated. This paper present {{a comparison of the}} risks of water contamination when sludges are applied to forests instead of cropland. The levels of metals in municipal sludge, their form and their mobility in sludge-treated soil are reviewed. Finally, the regulations of the Province of Quebec that have been established to protect forest land are compared to the recommendations of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. Although sludge applications to forest land reduce the risk of human foodchain contamination, properties of forest soils (low pH, low cation exchange capacity (CEC), presence of large continuous pores) could represent an increased hazard of metals leaching to aquatic ecosystems. Metal concentrations in sludge vary considerably depending on the source of the sludge. Metals found in sludge are predominantly associated with the solid phase, while soluble and exchangeable forms generally represent less than 10 % of the total metals. Short term studies have revealed that metals tend to accumulate in the upper layers of soil, but few studies have evaluated long-term metal mobility or bioavailability. Many factors can contribute to an increase mobility (pH, oxidation-reduction potential, organic matter decomposition). The risk of aquatic ecosystem contamination by aluminum leached from sludge-treated soils hasn't yet been evaluated. It seems, however, that the risk exists if the soil become more <b>acidic</b> after sludge <b>decomposition.</b> Limits on the amount of metals allowed in sludge have been fixed by many countries. Nevertheless, given the wide variation in the standards used to regulate the allowable content of metal in sludge or sludge-treated soils, disagreement presently exist among regulatory agencies. For example, the maximum cadmium limit allowed in sludge destined to be used as forest fertilizer in Quebec is 15 mg kg- 1, whereas it is 85 mg kg- 1 in the United States. Different philosophical views on environmental protection (zero tolerance or tolerance of a certain level of metals in soil), as well as the organism chosen when standards are set, are responsible for this inconsistency. Before sewage sludge application to forests becomes a common practice, the associated risks of metals leaching to the aquatic ecosystem must be evaluated. Long-term studies should be undertaken in order to establish safe standards for applying sludge in a forest environment. Such additional efforts will enable good quality sludge to be considered as a usable and valuable resource in forestry...|$|R
