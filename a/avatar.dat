5|$|In February 2017, {{the media}} website My Entertainment World stated that <b>Avatar</b> 2 had entered {{production}} and shooting would start on August 15, 2017, with Manhattan Beach, California {{as the main}} shooting location. Cameron confirmed the upcoming shooting, and that the writing of all four sequels was now complete. The following sequels are expected to start shooting right after <b>Avatar</b> 2 wraps filming. The following month, Cameron revealed that <b>Avatar</b> 2 would not be released in 2018, as originally believed. The sequel release dates were announced as starting on Dec. 18, 2020, for <b>Avatar</b> 2, Dec. 17, 2021 for <b>Avatar</b> 3, Dec. 20, 2024 for <b>Avatar</b> 4, and Dec. 19, 2025 for <b>Avatar</b> 5. In June 2017, Jon Landau stated at the CineEurope conference that principal photography will begin on September 25, 2017.|$|E
5|$|In the Birthright route, the <b>Avatar</b> helps their Hoshidan kin {{defend their}} country from {{invasion}} by Nohr. After confrontations with the <b>Avatar,</b> Camilla and Leo's lives are spared. With {{the help of}} Elise and Shura, the man who kidnapped Azura from Nohr, the <b>Avatar</b> and their company invade the Nohrian capital. Elise is killed when she attempts to stop the <b>Avatar</b> and Xander from fighting, and Xander falls into despair and forces the <b>Avatar</b> to kill him. The <b>Avatar</b> then faces Garon, killing him with the Yato after it is infused with added power from Ryoma and Takumi's Legendary Weapons. However, Azura dies after having overused her singing powers to weaken Garon. In the epilogue, Ryoma is crowned king of Hoshido and Leo is crowned king of Nohr, and peace is forged between the two kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|The Avataric Blood travels within {{families}} {{forming a}} dynasty. The first-born {{son of an}} <b>Avatar</b> receives a so-called mantle at birth that manifests him as an <b>Avatar</b> of a new generation; whether the new <b>Avatar</b> is Light or Dark is chance. Therefore, there is one <b>Avatar</b> to each House per generation. Giving birth to a new <b>Avatar</b> leaves the mother barren and insane. Before that time, she can give birth to an unlimited number of females from an <b>Avatar.</b> These {{children as well as}} their respective offspring are called Vectori, beings with Avataric Blood who are not themselves Avatara, and who thus become generationally further removed from an <b>Avatar</b> in the bloodline. While Vectori cannot become Avatara, as that mantle is only conveyed upon birth, they can still exhibit some minor powers and often show signs of insanity.|$|E

500|$|Puranic scriptures contain {{occasional}} {{references to}} [...] "ansh" [...] – literally portion, or <b>avatars</b> of Shiva, {{but the idea}} of Shiva <b>avatars</b> is not universally accepted in Saivism.

25|$|<b>Avatars</b> {{are also}} {{observed}} in Shaktism, the sect {{dedicated to the}} worship of the Goddess (Devi), {{but they do not}} have universal acceptance in the sect. The Devi Bhagavata Purana describes the descent of Devi <b>avatars</b> to punish the wicked and defend the righteous – much as the Bhagavata Purana does with the <b>avatars</b> of Vishnu. Like Vishnu, his consort Lakshmi incarnates as Sita and Radha– the consorts of Rama and Krishna <b>avatars.</b> Nilakantha, an 18th-century commentator on the Devi Bhagavata Purana– which includes the Devi Gita– says that various <b>avatars</b> of the Goddess includes Shakambhari and even the masculine Krishna and Rama– generally thought to be Vishnu's <b>avatars.</b> Lakshmi and Saraswati are also goddesses worshipped as Devi <b>avatars.</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{coming of}} age, the <b>Avatar</b> is sent by Garon to inspect a Hoshidan {{fortress}} above the Bottomless Canyon. However, one of Garon's men, Hans, provokes {{a battle with}} the Hoshidans and throws the Avatar's mentor Gunter into the Canyon. The <b>Avatar</b> is found and captured by Hoshidan soldiers, who recognize them as a long-lost member of the Hoshidan royal family. The <b>Avatar</b> is brought to meet their blood relatives and Azura at the capital city. However, soldiers attack the city and a hooded assassin attempts to kill the <b>Avatar.</b> Mikoto shields them {{at the cost of}} her life. In the aftermath, the <b>Avatar</b> comes into possession of a legendary sword called Yato, said to belong to the one who will save the world. In the opening battle between the two kingdoms, the Avatar's two families meet, and the <b>Avatar</b> is forced to choose between siding with Hoshido and Nohr. In the Birthright and Conquest routes, the <b>Avatar</b> chooses either their biological or adopted family, respectively. This causes them to be denounced by the other side, and they are gradually forced to fight them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Avatar</b> won the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects, and was {{nominated}} for a total of nine, including Best Picture and Best Director. <b>Avatar</b> also won the 67th Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture– Drama and Best Director, and {{was nominated}} for two others.

5|$|In the Conquest route, the <b>Avatar</b> both {{fights in}} the war against Hoshido, and works with their adoptive family to change Nohr's brutal {{reputation}} from within. After Azura reveals that King Garon has been replaced by an impostor, the <b>Avatar</b> decides to have Garon sit upon the magical throne of Hoshido, which will remove the false Garon's disguise. During the invasion of Hoshido, the Nohrians spare Hinoka and capture Sakura, while Takumi, whose behavior has become increasingly erratic and violent throughout the war, apparently dies by jumping off of a rampart. Garon orders the <b>Avatar</b> to kill Ryoma. After their fight, Ryoma spares the <b>Avatar</b> the pain of killing their own brother by killing himself. Infusing the Yato with the power of Xander and Leo's Legendary Weapons, the <b>Avatar</b> confronts and kills the false Garon. However, a crazed Takumi suddenly appears and attacks them, and it is revealed he has been long dead and his body is possessed. The <b>Avatar</b> destroys Takumi's body to free his soul. Azura overuses her powers as in the Birthright route, but her death is not seen and she is instead marked as missing. In the epilogue, Hinoka is crowned queen of Hoshido and Xander is crowned king of Nohr, and a peaceful alliance between the two kingdoms is formed.|$|E
40|$|A virtual {{environment}} is a computer-generated world {{that can be}} used for training, data visualization, recreation, and commerce.

5|$|In the game's introduction, {{the ghost}} of Garamon haunts the Avatar's dreams with {{warnings}} of a great danger in Britannia. The <b>Avatar</b> allows Garamon to take him there, where he watches Tyball kidnap Arial. Tyball escapes, leaving the <b>Avatar</b> to be caught by the Baron's guards. The guards {{take him to the}} Baron, who banishes him to the Great Stygian Abyss to rescue Arial. After the introduction, the <b>Avatar</b> explores the dungeon and finds remnants of Cabirus's colony. A few possible scenarios include deciding the fate of two warring goblin tribes, learning a language, and playing an instrument to complete a quest. The <b>Avatar</b> eventually defeats Tyball and frees Arial.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sequel}} series' first season, <b>Avatar</b> Aang's spirit {{occasionally}} {{serves as the}} spiritual advisor to seventeen-year-old Korra (much like the previous <b>Avatar</b> incarnation, Roku, did for Aang). Initially, Aang is only able to give Korra glimpses of his memory concerning Yakone in relation to her confrontations with his two sons, Amon and Tarrlok, the products of Yakone's Bloodbending vendetta on the <b>Avatar.</b> It is only after she loses her ability to bend that Korra allows herself {{to listen to her}} past lives, at which point Aang restores her powers by triggering the <b>Avatar</b> State and teaching her to Energybend.|$|E

On , 47 days after its domestic release, <b>Avatar</b> surpassed Titanic to become the highest-grossing film of all time in Canada and the United States. It became the highest-grossing film of all time in at least 30 other countries and is the first film to earn over $2billion in foreign box office receipts.|$|E
50|$|There is {{very low}} {{overhead}} associated with chat traffic. The <b>avatars,</b> up to 16K bytes each, are a potential source of performance problems. When a chatter first enters a room, which may contain many other chatters, he is sent all their <b>avatars.</b> This can be {{a major source of}} “lag,” which is addressed by sending the <b>avatar′s</b> asynchronous to the conversation text. A chatter will begin seeing the room conversation immediately, and he can participate in the conversation before any <b>avatars</b> are loaded. While <b>avatars</b> are loading the chatter will see “hour glass” graphics in place of peoples’ <b>avatars.</b> As the <b>avatars</b> are downloaded, interleaved with conversation, one by one the hour glasses convert to individual pictures. The time this takes varies depending on the connection.|$|R
50|$|Though {{there are}} quotes in Arul Nool to {{accredit}} the ten <b>Avatars</b> of Vishnu, {{it seems that}} they are not seen in equal status with these incarnations (as in the table). It was considered secondary to the primary <b>avatars,</b> who are associated with the destructions of the fragments of Kroni. This view is not inconsistent with Hinduism, as only Narasimha, Rama and Krishna are considered the primary <b>avatars</b> who are still worshipped. The other <b>avatars</b> are considered secondary <b>avatars</b> who are not worshipped.|$|R

5|$|Like Vishnu's {{first two}} avatars - Matsya (fish) and Kurma (turtle), the third <b>avatar</b> Varaha is {{depicted}} either in zoomorphic form as an animal (a wild boar), or anthropomorphically. The main {{difference in the}} anthropomorphic form portrayal {{is that the first}} two avatars are depicted with a torso of a man and the bottom half as animal, while Varaha has an animal (boar) head and a human body. The portrayal of the anthropomorphic Varaha is similar to the fourth <b>avatar</b> Narasimha (portrayed as a lion-headed man), who is the first <b>avatar</b> of Vishnu that is not completely animal.|$|E
5|$|More than {{a century}} before {{the events of the}} series begin, Fire Lord Sozin, ruler of the Fire Nation, planned a world war to expand his nation's {{territory}} and influence. He was prevented from carrying out his plans by <b>Avatar</b> Roku, who was born in the Fire Nation. After Roku's death, the <b>Avatar</b> was reincarnated as an Airbender named Aang. As Aang was then only a child, Sozin saw his chance and proceeded with his militant plans. Because of the threat of Sozin's war, Aang learned about his <b>avatar</b> status when he was only twelve years old. Afraid of his new responsibilities and of separation from his mentor, Gyatso, he fled his home on his flying bison named Appa. Forced into the ocean by a storm, Aang entered the <b>avatar</b> state and encased them in suspended animation in an iceberg for one hundred years. Sozin, knowing that the avatar's reincarnation cycle mandated that an air nomad was the new <b>avatar,</b> carried out a genocide against the Air Nomads during the passing of a once-a-century comet which increases the Firebenders' power, and continues his world conquest.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Avatar</b> completes {{a series}} of tests at Scintillus Academy, a mage school whose staff was killed by the Guardian. Afterwards, the player travels to the Pits of Carnage, a {{subterranean}} prison on a world where the Guardian trains soldiers to attack other dimensions; and to the Tomb of Praecor Loth, where a king killed in a war with the Guardian is buried. Finally, the <b>Avatar</b> visits the Ethereal Void, a strange world with floating, glowing pathways and no map. Eventually, the <b>Avatar</b> discovers that Mayor Patterson is the traitor and destroys the blackrock dome.|$|E
25|$|The Bhagavata Purana {{describes}} Vishnu's <b>avatars</b> as innumerable, though ten of his incarnations (Dashavatara), are celebrated therein as {{his major}} appearances.

The commonly accepted number of ten <b>avatars</b> for Vishnu was fixed well before the 10th century CE.|$|R
25|$|<b>Avatars</b> like Hayagriva, Hamsa and Garuda {{are also}} {{mentioned}} in the Pañcaratra making the total of thirty-nine <b>avatars.</b> However, despite these lists, the commonly accepted number of ten <b>avatars</b> for Vishnu was fixed well before the 10th century CE.|$|R

5|$|Upon death, <b>Avatar</b> Roku was reincarnated and Aang was born, {{and later}} raised by Monk Gyatso, a senior monk at the Southern Air Temple {{and friend of}} the late <b>Avatar</b> Roku. Even prior to {{learning}} he was the <b>Avatar,</b> Aang distinguished himself by {{becoming one of the}} youngest Airbending Masters in history by inventing a new technique. As a result of Fire Lord Sozin's increasingly hostile attitude towards the other nations, the senior monks decided to reveal Aang's nature as the <b>Avatar</b> four years before the traditional age (Avatars are usually told of their status once they turn 16) and relocate him to one of the other Air Temples. Learning that he was to be taken from Gyatso caused Aang to flee the monastery on his flying bison, Appa, before being caught by a storm; the life-or-death conditions triggered the <b>Avatar</b> State, encasing the young <b>Avatar</b> and his bison in an air-pocket among icebergs, where he remained suspended for a century.|$|E

Consistent with the predictions of information processing theory, results indicated that anthropomorphic qualities increased perceived realism and subsequent homophily judgments.
