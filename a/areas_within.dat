5|$|Ganymede {{also has}} polar caps, likely {{composed}} of water frost. The frost extends to 40° latitude. These polar caps were first {{seen by the}} Voyager spacecraft. Theories on {{the formation of the}} caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder <b>areas</b> <b>within</b> the polar terrain.|$|E
5|$|In November, Croatia, Serbia and the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) {{agreed upon}} the Vance plan, {{designed}} to halt combat {{operations in the}} Croatian War of Independence and allow the negotiation of a political settlement. Besides the ceasefire, the plan entailed protection of civilians in specific areas, designated as United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs), and UN peacekeepers in Croatia—United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The ceasefire came into effect on 3 January 1992. Shortly after the Vance plan was accepted, the European Community announced its decision to grant diplomatic recognition to Croatia on 15 January 1992, while the Serb- and JNA-held <b>areas</b> <b>within</b> Croatia were organised as the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK).|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane, 5,791Marines from Mexico's Naval Infantry Force were deployed to assist with recovery and rescue efforts.

Red Cross volunteers began needs assessments on October24 and distribution of humanitarian aid started the following day. Power was restored to 88percent of those affected within two days of the storm. Through the nation's livestock catastrophe fund, 150million pesos (US$9million) were allocated for agricultural areas affected by the storm on October29. Of this total, 76million pesos (US$4.6million) were delegated to Jalisco.|$|E

5|$|Like chondrostean fish, {{the major}} immune tissues of bony fish (or teleostei) include the kidney (especially the {{anterior}} kidney), which houses many different immune cells. In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune <b>areas</b> <b>within</b> mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes {{are believed to}} reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus. In 2006, a lymphatic system {{similar to that in}} mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the zebrafish. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) T cells accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigen.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all Khmer Loeu are animist, {{and their}} cosmologies are {{intertwined}} with the natural world. Some forests {{are believed to be}} inhabited by local spirits, and local taboos forbid cutting in those <b>areas.</b> <b>Within</b> spirit forests, certain natural features such as rock formations, waterfalls, pools, and vegetation are sacred. Major sacrificial festivals in Ratanakiri occur during March and April, when fields are selected and prepared for the new planting season. Christian missionaries are present in the province, and some Khmer Loeu have converted to Christianity. The region's ethnic Khmer are Buddhist. There is also a small Muslim community, consisting mainly of ethnic Cham.|$|E
5|$|The player picks one of {{the three}} {{brothers}} to play as; Pixie can also be unlocked as a playable character. They traverse six <b>areas</b> <b>within</b> a time limit to make it back to the fairy world in time. The areas all consist of a number of floors; the player needs to collect all keys on each floor, before being allowed to jump down to a lower floor. To find the keys, the player uses a radar that displays their locations; once all have been collected, it shows the location of the exit. Once the player reaches the bottom floor, they are faced with a boss character they need to defeat, after which they can proceed to the next area.|$|E

5|$|The polar easterlies, {{also known}} as Polar Hadley cells, are dry, cold {{prevailing}} winds that blow from the high-pressure areas of the polar highs at {{the north and south}} poles towards the low-pressure <b>areas</b> <b>within</b> the Westerlies at high latitudes. Unlike the Westerlies, these prevailing winds blow from the east to the west, and are often weak and irregular. Because of the low sun angle, cold air builds up and subsides at the pole creating surface high-pressure areas, forcing an equatorward outflow of air; that outflow is deflected westward by the Coriolis effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{state is}} divided into 77 {{counties}} that govern locally, each headed by a three-member council of elected commissioners, a tax assessor, clerk, court clerk, treasurer, and sheriff. While each municipality operates as a separate and independent local government with executive, legislative and judicial power, county governments maintain jurisdiction over both incorporated cities and non-incorporated <b>areas</b> <b>within</b> their boundaries, but have executive power but no legislative or judicial power. Both county and municipal governments collect taxes, employ a separate police force, hold elections, and operate emergency response services within their jurisdiction. Other local government units include school districts, technology center districts, community college districts, rural fire departments, rural water districts, and other special use districts.|$|E
5|$|United Armenia (classical , reformed: Միացյալ Հայաստան, translit.

The idea of what Armenians see as unification of their historical lands was prevalent throughout the 20th century and has been advocated by individuals, various organizations and institutions, including the nationalist parties Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF or Dashnaktsutyun) and Heritage, the ASALA and others.|$|E
