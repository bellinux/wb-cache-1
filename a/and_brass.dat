5|$|As the temperance {{movement}} faded {{the bands}} found new benefactors in the colliery owners, and many bands {{took on the}} names of specific collieries. A memorable image {{of the connection between}} the collieries <b>and</b> <b>brass</b> bands came in 1985, when the Maerdy miners were filmed returning to work after the miners' strike, marching behind the village band.|$|E
5|$|Aspects of Scouting {{practice}} {{have been}} criticized as too militaristic. Military-style uniforms, badges of rank, flag ceremonies, <b>and</b> <b>brass</b> bands were commonly accepted {{in the early years}} because they were a part of normal society, but since then have diminished or been abandoned in both Scouting and society.|$|E
5|$|During the Brooke era, Sarawak Malays were {{predominantly}} fishermen, leading to their villages being concentrated along river banks. However, {{with the advent}} of urban development, many Malays have migrated to seek employment in public and private sectors. Traditionally, they are known for their silver <b>and</b> <b>brass</b> crafts, wood carvings, and textiles.|$|E

5|$|According to Edward Trollope, {{the oldest}} {{tombstone}} {{in the church}} was from the 13th century; it was faded and illegible when he recorded it in or before 1872. A 14th-century slab, originally for a now-lost effigy, is in the church, <b>and</b> <b>brass</b> plate {{from the same period}} was discovered during the 1853 restoration. Richard Dokke, along with his wife Joanna and son John, are commemorated in a plaque dating to the 1430s, and a plaque to William Harebeter and his wife Elizabeth also dates to the 15th century.|$|E

5|$|Built by J.W.Walker and Sons, {{the organ}} was {{completed}} {{only two days}} before the opening of the cathedral in 1967. Made {{as an integral part of}} the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his brief and so designed the striking front to the organ. Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of the pipes at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so arranged the shiny zinc pipes <b>and</b> <b>brass</b> trumpets en chamade to contrast strikingly with concrete pillars which surround the organ.|$|E

5|$|Italian opera became {{immensely popular}} in the 19th century and was known across even the most rural {{sections}} of the country. Most villages had occasional opera productions, and the techniques used in opera influenced rural folk musics. Opera spread through itinerant ensembles <b>and</b> <b>brass</b> bands, focused in a local village. These civic bands (banda communale) used instruments to perform operatic arias, with trombones or fluegelhorns for male vocal parts and cornets for female parts.|$|E

5|$|Nickel {{is slowly}} {{oxidized}} by air {{at room temperature}} and is considered corrosion-resistant. Historically, {{it has been used}} for plating iron <b>and</b> <b>brass,</b> coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 9% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant nickel plating. Nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Settlements grew {{up around}} both castles on the Medina, but East Cowes Castle was rapidly {{abandoned}} and ultimately destroyed by coastal erosion; as a result, today West Cowes Castle is often simply referred to as Cowes Castle. Inspections in 1547 showed that there were 17 iron <b>and</b> <b>brass</b> artillery pieces at the fort, but that nine of these were inoperable; nonetheless it continued in use as a fortification after the original invasion scare had ended, staffed with a garrison of a captain, porter and three gunners during Queen Elizabeth's reign.|$|E
5|$|The Tagora Présidence was {{a concept}} car {{designed}} by stylist Sunny Atri at the Talbot design studio in Whitley, Coventry. The concept {{was created to}} generate interest in employing high-end Tagoras as chauffeur-driven limousines by users such as business executives and government officials. The donor model for the Présidence was the 2.6 SX, which had an interior appointed with Connolly Leather upholstery <b>and</b> <b>brass</b> highlights, plus a host of electronics including a telephone, dictaphone, text-message receiver, and television with VCR. Originally valued at £25,000, the Présidence now resides at a car museum in Poissy.|$|E

The Fort is commemorated by a large relief above {{the entrance of the}} London Guarantee Building, <b>and</b> <b>brass</b> markers positioned in the sidewalks {{on the south side of}} the bridge delineate the posited outline of the original blockhouse.|$|E
5|$|The temperance movement, {{which had}} been absorbed into the moralistic system of the Nonconformist chapels, caused a shift in social attitudes in the mid- to late-19th- and early-20th century Rhondda. Alcohol was looked down upon and so were the {{increasingly}} violent sports such as rugby, so young men looked for different and more acceptable pastimes. Voice choirs were a natural progression from chapel society, <b>and</b> <b>brass</b> bands would eventually gain acceptance by the movement.|$|E
5|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{writes that}} {{the content of the}} five loops has {{continued}} to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most widely held views, he says that, aside from McCartney's laughter and the B flat major chord, the sounds were two loops of sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string <b>and</b> <b>brass</b> voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two loops of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo.|$|E
