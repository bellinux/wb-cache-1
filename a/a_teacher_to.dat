5|$|Most {{schools were}} {{residential}} whereby {{both teachers and}} students resided as a rule. The teachers appointed were jurists, theologians, and traditionalists who received their salary from endowments to the institutions they taught in. Each student was offered a lodging where he would resort, <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>to</b> instruct him in whatever art he requested, and regular grants to cover all his needs. Madrasas were considered prestigious institutions in society. Under the Ayyubids, {{it was not possible}} to obtain a job in the government without receiving an education from a madrasa.|$|E

5|$|As {{introduced}} in Soulcalibur, Ivy {{was raised by}} the Valentines, a noble family in London, England. Ivy's father became obsessed with the cursed sword Soul Edge, and worked himself to death. Her mother died shortly afterward, and revealed to Ivy {{that she was not}} their biological daughter. Becoming an alchemist, Ivy learned of her father's obsession and decided to destroy Soul Edge. She created an animated, segmented sword, bringing it to life by unknowingly summoning Soul Edge's current host, Nightmare, and was convinced to become one of his servants without realizing he wielded the blade she sought. After learning the truth, and that her real father was the sword's previous host Cervantes and her to be its next, she departed. Continuing her quest to destroy the sword in later games, Ivy was attacked by Cervantes and her soul consumed in Soulcalibur IV. Using an artificial soul to keep herself alive, she acts as <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>to</b> younger warriors when the sword re-appears years later.|$|E

25|$|While {{most studies}} of {{dialogue}} journals {{focus on the}} development of student writing, several researchers have explored their use and value for developing and assessing students' reading competence, especially students acquiring English as a second language.

In dialogue journal interactions, {{regardless of whether or not}} the topic is about reading assignments, reading and writing are integrated as communicative activities.|$|E

25|$|A {{dialogue}} journal {{allows students}} and <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>to</b> together use authentic communication (including questioning, complaining, complimenting, apologizing, and requesting) to communicate honestly and openly and “get things done”. This distinguishes it from most student writing assignments, which {{are restricted to}} monologic description, explanation, or narrative. This aspect of everyday language use is known in philosophy as speech acts (John Searle) and in linguistics as pragmatics. (J.L.

25|$|In some Jewish {{communities}} a tallit gadol {{is given}} {{as a gift}} by a father to a son, a father-in-law to a son-in-law, or <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>to</b> a student.

Many parents purchase a tallit gadol for their sons {{at the age of}} 13, together with tefillin, though among the orthodox a male child will have been wearing a tallit katan from pre-school age. In the non-Orthodox Reform and Conservative movements in addition to the men, some women nowadays also wear a tallit gadol. While many worshipers bring their own tallit gadol to synagogue, there is usually a rack of them for the use of visitors and guests.|$|E

As cartoon art and caricature were popular among the British amateur painters at the Burma Art Club, it was at the BAC that Ba Zaw most likely honed such skills. Martin Jones, {{who was one of the}} early British members of the BAC, is said to have been the first painter in Burma to draw and publish cartoons in Burmese publications. Such works can be found in Ballads of Burma, reprinted in recent years. Martin Jones was a close friend and patron of Ba Zaw.|$|E

25|$|Frege matriculated at the University of Jena in {{the spring}} of 1869 as a citizen of the North German Confederation. In the four semesters of his studies he {{attended}} approximately twenty courses of lectures, most of them on mathematics and physics. His most important teacher was Ernst Karl Abbe (1840–1905; physicist, mathematician, and inventor). Abbe gave lectures on theory of gravity, galvanism and electrodynamics, complex analysis theory of functions of a complex variable, applications of physics, selected divisions of mechanics, and mechanics of solids. Abbe was more than <b>a</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>to</b> Frege: he was a trusted friend, and, as director of the optical manufacturer Carl Zeiss AG, he {{was in a position to}} advance Frege's career.

25|$|Similar to {{a long-running}} program {{in place at}} Winston Churchill High School, an advisor program was {{introduced}} in the fall of 2006.

More personal than that of the counselling department, the program offers the opportunity for students to seek advice from an influential adult. Administrative duties, such as public announcements and the handing out of report cards and newsletters, is done in sessions. Advisors also make mid-semester phone-home reports to parents. Most students do not have their advisor as a classroom instructor. In most circumstances, students will have the same advisor for all four years of high school.|$|E
