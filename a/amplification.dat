5|$|Intel and SiliconSystems (acquired by Western Digital in 2009) {{used the}} term write <b>amplification</b> in their papers and {{publications}} as early as 2008. Write <b>amplification</b> is typically measured by the ratio of writes committed to the flash memory to the writes coming from the host system. Without compression, write <b>amplification</b> cannot drop below one. Using compression, SandForce has claimed to achieve a typical write <b>amplification</b> of 0.5, with best-case values as low as 0.14 in the SF-2281 controller.|$|E
5|$|MYCN {{oncogene}} <b>amplification</b> {{within the}} tumor {{is a common}} finding in neuroblastoma. The degree of <b>amplification</b> shows a bimodal distribution: either 3- to 10-fold, or 100- to 300-fold. The presence of this mutation is highly correlated to advanced stages of disease.|$|E
5|$|Many factors {{affect the}} write <b>amplification</b> of an SSD. The table below lists the primary factors {{and how they}} affect the write <b>amplification.</b> For factors that are variable, the table notes {{if it has a}} direct {{relationship}} or an inverse relationship. For example, as the amount of over-provisioning increases, the write <b>amplification</b> decreases (inverse relationship). If the factor is a toggle (enabled or disabled) function then it has either a positive or negative relationship.|$|E

5|$|Reads do {{not require}} an erase of the flash memory, so they are not {{generally}} associated with write <b>amplification.</b> In the limited chance of a read disturb error, the data in that block is read and rewritten, but this would not have any material impact on the write <b>amplification</b> of the drive.|$|E
5|$|Subtypes 2A and 2B: {{found in}} {{unfavorable}} widespread neuroblastoma, stages 3 and 4, with 11q loss and 17q gain without N-myc <b>amplification</b> (subtype 2A) or with N-myc <b>amplification</b> often together with 1p deletions and 17q gain (subtype 2B).|$|E
5|$|The overall {{performance}} of an SSD {{is dependent upon}} a number of factors, including write <b>amplification.</b> Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than reading from it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components connected in parallel to increase performance. If the SSD has a high write <b>amplification,</b> the controller {{will be required to}} write that many more times to the flash memory. This requires even more time to write the data from the host. An SSD with a low write <b>amplification</b> will not need to write as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high write <b>amplification.</b>|$|E
30|$|DNA <b>amplifications</b> {{with each}} ISSR primer were {{repeated}} {{at least twice}} to ensure reproducibility. The bands were considered reproducible and scorable only after observing and comparing them in two separate <b>amplifications</b> for each primer. Clear and intense bands were scored while faint bands against background smear were not considered for further analysis.|$|R

5|$|G-spot <b>amplification</b> (also called G-spot {{augmentation}} or the G-Shot) is {{a procedure}} intended to temporarily increase pleasure in sexually active women with normal sexual function, focusing on increasing {{the size and}} sensitivity of the G-spot. G-spot <b>amplification</b> is performed by attempting to locate the G-spot and noting measurements for future reference. After numbing the area with a local anesthetic, human engineered collagen is then injected directly under the mucosa in the area the G-spot is concluded to be in.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiation}} {{amplified by}} hydroxyl masers is the radio continuum of its host. This continuum is primarily composed of synchrotron radiation produced by Type II supernovae. <b>Amplification</b> of this background is low, with <b>amplification</b> factors, or gains, {{ranging from a}} few percent to a few hundred percent, and sources with larger hyperfine ratios typically exhibiting larger gains. Sources with higher gains typically have narrower emission lines. This is expected if the pre-gain linewidths are all roughly the same, as line centers are amplified more than the wings, leading to line narrowing.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTelomere {{dysfunction}} {{and associated}} fusion-breakage in the mouse encourages epithelial carcinogenesis {{and a more}} humanized genomic profile that includes nonreciprocal translocations (NRTs). Here, array comparative genomic hybridization {{was used to determine}} the pathogenic significance of NRTs and to determine whether telomere dysfunction also drives <b>amplifications</b> and deletions of cancer-relevant loci. Compared to tumors arising in mice with intact telomeres, tumors with telomere dysfunction possessed higher levels of genomic instability and showed numerous <b>amplifications</b> and deletions in regions syntenic to human cancer hotspots. These observations suggest that telomere-based crisis provides a mechanism of chromosomal instability, including regional <b>amplifications</b> and deletions, that drives carcinogenesis. This model provides a platform for discovery of genes responsible for the major cancers affecting aged humans...|$|R
5|$|Write <b>amplification</b> {{was always}} present in SSDs before {{the term was}} defined, {{but it was in}} 2008 that both Intel and SiliconSystems started using the term in their papers and publications. All SSDs have a write <b>amplification</b> value and it is based on both what is {{currently}} being written and what was previously written to the SSD. In order to accurately measure the value for a specific SSD, the selected test should be run for enough time to ensure the drive has reached a steady state condition.|$|E

After Definitely Maybe, he began using smaller amps, {{singling}} out Fenders (Princeton and Bandmaster), and also a combo made by Clark <b>Amplification,</b> which builds amplifiers based on vintage Fender and Marshall amps.|$|E
5|$|Many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} advanced {{as to what}} functions the cranial crest of Parasaurolophus performed, but most have been discredited. It is now believed {{that it may have}} had several functions: visual display for identifying species and sex, sound <b>amplification</b> for communication, and thermoregulation. It is not clear which was most significant at what times {{in the evolution of the}} crest and its internal nasal passages.|$|E
40|$|International audienceGenetic {{instability}} in Strepfomyces ambofaciens DSM 40697 involves genomic rearrangements such as <b>amplifications</b> and deletions of particular DNA sequences. Most <b>amplifications</b> {{were located in}} two amplifiable regions, one of which, called AUD 6 (amplifiable unit of DNA no. 6) was revealed to be a rearrangement hotspot. Indeed, 30 % of the mutant strains studied had <b>amplifications,</b> deletions or both at the AUD 6 locus. This locus contains several reiterations which are specific to this AUD. Moreover, one of the endpoints of the AUD 6 shows homology with an internal sequence. Deletions occurred exclusively at {{one side of the}} amplified DNA sequence (ADS) and removed part of the proximal copy of this ADS, leading to the conclusion that multiple rearrangements can occur at this AUD locus...|$|R

5|$|Nucleic acid <b>amplification</b> tests (NAATs), direct {{fluorescein}} tests (DFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) {{are highly}} sensitive tests that can identify specific pathogens present. Serology testing for antibodies {{is not as}} useful since {{the presence of the}} microorganisms in healthy people can confound interpreting the antibody titer levels, although antibody levels can indicate whether an infection is recent or long-term.|$|E
5|$|Nucleic acid <b>amplification</b> {{tests and}} {{adenosine}} deaminase testing may allow rapid diagnosis of TB. These tests, however, are not routinely recommended, as they rarely alter {{how a person}} is treated. Blood tests to detect antibodies are not specific or sensitive, so they are not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotides find {{a variety}} of {{applications}} in molecular biology and medicine. They are most commonly used as antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNA, primers for DNA sequencing and <b>amplification,</b> probes for detecting complementary DNA or RNA via molecular hybridization, tools for the targeted introduction of mutations and restriction sites, and for the synthesis of artificial genes.|$|E

5|$|Over-provisioning (sometimes spelled as OP, over provisioning, or overprovisioning) is the {{difference}} between the physical capacity of the flash memory and the logical capacity presented through the operating system (OS) as available for the user. During the garbage collection, wear-leveling, and bad block mapping operations on the SSD, the additional space from over-provisioning helps lower the write <b>amplification</b> when the controller writes to the flash memory.|$|E
5|$|The ATA Secure Erase {{command is}} {{designed}} to remove all user data from a drive. With an SSD without integrated encryption, this command will put the drive back to its original out-of-box state. This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best (lowest number) possible write <b>amplification,</b> {{but as soon as}} the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write <b>amplification</b> will start returning to the former levels. Many tools use the ATA Secure Erase command to reset the drive and provide a user interface as well. One free tool that is commonly referenced in the industry is called HDDErase. Gparted and Ubuntu live CDs provide a bootable Linux system of disk utilities including secure erase.|$|E
