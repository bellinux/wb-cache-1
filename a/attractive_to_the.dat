5|$|The {{size of the}} Parthian army is unknown, as is {{the size}} of the empire's overall population. However, archaeological {{excavations}} in former Parthian urban centers reveal settlements which could have sustained large populations and hence a great resource in manpower. Dense population centers in regions like Babylonia were no doubt <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Romans, whose armies could afford to live off the land.|$|E
5|$|After {{the landing}} at Normandy, {{a revival of}} Anvil became {{increasingly}} <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allied planners. The Normandy ports had insufficient capacity to handle Allied supply needs {{and at the same}} time French generals under Charles de Gaulle pressed for a direct attack on Southern France with participation of French troops. These factors led to a reconsideration of the plan. Despite Churchill's objections, the operation was authorized by the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff on 14July and then renamed Dragoon on 1August. The landing was scheduled for 15August.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{efforts to}} win the {{population}} countered the Protestant idea of a national church with Polonization, or nationalization of the Catholic Church in the Commonwealth, introducing a variety of native elements {{to make it more}} accessible and <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> masses. The Church hierarchy went along with the notion. The changes that took place during the 17th century defined the character of Polish Catholicism for centuries to come.|$|E

5|$|In 135 BC, Tang Meng led the {{earliest}} Han expedition against Dian, establishing the Jianwei commandery in southwestern China. The Dian tribes {{were involved in}} the trade of livestock, horses, fruit, and slaves, and was <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Han because of their resources and metalworking expertise. Trade routes between Dian {{and the rest of the}} Han empire were opened up by Han soldiers. The Han continued their expansion northward, and annexed the territory near Shu.|$|E
5|$|The same {{squad of}} players carried their {{promotion}} form into the 1955–56 {{season in the}} First Division, achieving the club's highest league finish of sixth place, and reaching the FA Cup final. They became <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media; after the FA Cup semifinal victory, Boyd signed an exclusive contract committing himself and his teammates to appearing only on BBC programmes in {{the weeks leading up}} to the final.|$|E
5|$|The street {{became popular}} with entertainers {{including}} bear-baiters, theatres and public houses. However, {{it was not}} <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> middle and upper classes due to the nearby Tyburn gallows and St Giles, then a notorious rookery, or slum. The gallows were removed in 1783, {{and by the end}} of the century, Oxford Street was built up from St Giles Circus to Park Lane, containing a mix of residential houses and entertainment. The Princess's Theatre opened in 1840, and is now the site of Oxford Walk shopping area.|$|E

5|$|After {{these talks}} with Rudd, Lobengula called an indaba (conference) of over 100 izinDuna {{to present the}} {{proposed}} concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies. It {{soon became clear that}} opinion was split: most of the younger izinDuna were opposed to the idea of any concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older izinDuna were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, {{but there was also a}} case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.|$|E
5|$|Before commencing {{the designs}} for the {{characters}} in Devil May Cry 4, character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa consulted with {{several members of the}} staff that had worked in the series previously, in order to become familiar with previous elements. The characters were designed in order to emphasize their moves, which made the staff controlling their motions vital in the design. Some of the demonic forms of the antagonists in Devil May Cry 4 resemble angels. These characters were designed to be <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game's audience while providing a contrast when compared to other demons in the game. Yoshikawa noted that several of the boss characters presented some difficulty when creating them, but that Nero's design {{was one of the biggest}} challenges he had experienced in his career, based on the fact that the character would have to be accepted by the public and fit in the series' universe.|$|E
5|$|Howe was {{determined}} that the pipeline not be delayed, and proposed that the government advance money to the pipeline company to ensure construction in 1956. He emotionally pleaded with his Cabinet colleagues, who agreed both to the proposal and {{to the use of}} rarely used closure to limit the debate. Closure had not been applied in the House since 1932. The issue was <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tories and CCF with an election due within two years; it would allow them to portray Howe as an arrogant dictator, and play to those citizens who disliked the American involvement in the pipeline project. If the bill did not receive Royal Assent by 7 June 1956, options that Trans-Canada held for steel pipe would expire.|$|E

5|$|In late 1108 {{or early}} 1109, Henry V, then the King of the Romans, sent envoys to Normandy proposing that Matilda marry him, and wrote {{separately}} {{to her mother}} on the same matter. The match was <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English King: his daughter would be marrying {{into one of the}} most prestigious dynasties in Europe, reaffirming his own, slightly questionable, status as the youngest son of a new royal house, and gaining him an ally in dealing with France. In return, Henry V would receive a dowry of 10,000 marks, which he needed to fund an expedition to Rome for his coronation as the Holy Roman Emperor. The final details of the deal were negotiated at Westminster in June 1109 and, as a result of her changing status, Matilda attended a royal council for the first time that October. She left England in February 1110 to make her way to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Letters backing John {{arrived from}} the Pope in April, but by then the rebel barons had {{organised}} into a military faction. They congregated at Northampton in May and renounced their feudal ties to John, marching on London, Lincoln, and Exeter. John's efforts to appear moderate and conciliatory had been largely successful, but once the rebels held London, they attracted a fresh wave of defectors from the royalists. The King offered to submit the problem to a committee of arbitration with the Pope as the supreme arbiter, {{but this was not}} <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rebels. Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, had been working with the rebel barons on their demands, and after the suggestion of papal arbitration failed, John instructed Langton to organise peace talks.|$|E
5|$|On {{its opening}} the Met {{operated}} the trains on the District, receiving 55 per {{cent of the}} gross receipts for a fixed level of service. Extra trains required by the District were charged for and the District's share of the income dropped to about 40 per cent. The District's level of debt meant that the merger was no longer <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Met and did not proceed, so the Met's directors resigned from the District's board. To improve its finances, the District gave the Met notice to terminate the operating agreement. Struggling under the burden of its very high construction costs, the District was unable {{to continue with the}} remainder of the original scheme to reach Tower Hill and made a final extension of its line just one station east from Blackfriars to a previously unplanned City terminus at Mansion House.|$|E

5|$|Other {{characters}} include various schoolmates {{and staff}} members. Weenus (Michael Sinterniklaas) is a nerdy, psychopathic robot who is even {{lower on the}} social pyramid than the protagonists. Dreadnot (Dana Snyder) is a teacher at Harry S. Apocalypse who finds joy in torturing and invoking pain into his students. Their principal, Thunderbite (also voiced by Snyder), is an oversized, skull-shaped robot who, when not causing pain, acts sweet and motherly to the students. Megawatt (also voiced by Sinterniklaas) is a spoiled rich kid who is <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> female robots, most of whom he blows up; to Thrasher's disdain, he is dating Maimy. Tacklebot (Roger Craig Smith), Megawatt's friend and musclehead jock, acts violent and hostile toward the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic puffin is a bird of the colder {{waters of}} the North Atlantic Ocean. It breeds on the coasts of north west Europe, the Arctic fringes and eastern North America. More than 90% of the global {{population}} is found in Europe (4,770,000-5,780,000 pairs, equalling 9,550,000-11,600,000 adults) and colonies in Iceland alone are home to 60% of the world's Atlantic puffins. The largest colony in the western Atlantic (estimated at more than 260,000 pairs) {{can be found at}} the Witless Bay Ecological Reserve, south of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. Other major breeding locations include the north and west coasts of Norway, the Faroe Islands, the Shetland and Orkney islands, the west coast of Greenland and the coasts of Newfoundland. Smaller sized colonies are also found elsewhere in the British Isles, the Murmansk area of Russia, Novaya Zemlya, Spitzbergen, Labrador, Nova Scotia and Maine. Islands seem particularly <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> birds for breeding as compared to mainland sites.|$|E

25|$|The {{selection}} of the F-104A for the ADC was sort of curious, since {{it had not been}} originally designed as an interceptor and it lacked an adequate endurance and had no all-weather capability.

25|$|Artificial flies {{are made}} by {{fastening}} hair, fur, feathers, or other materials, both natural and synthetic, onto a hook.

25|$|The Latvian {{language}} was not <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Russian population of Latvia. In 1920–1930 {{only a little}} more than 15% of Russians could speak and write Latvian. The Latvian milieu of many towns was a good incentive for Russians to learn the Latvian language. 70% of Russian residents of Jelgava and more than 80% of those of Bauska, Valmiera and Kuldīga spoke Latvian.|$|E
