5|$|After the {{government}} ceased NYA operations, Robinson traveled to Honolulu {{in the fall}} of 1941 to play football for the semi-professional, racially integrated Honolulu Bears. After a short season, Robinson returned to California in December 1941 to pursue a career <b>as</b> <b>running</b> back for the Los Angeles Bulldogs of the Pacific Coast Football League. By that time, however, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had taken place, drawing the United States into World War II and ending Robinson's nascent football career.|$|E

5|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviewssome critics {{claimed it}} was fresh and a new sound, while others argued it was very similar to music already available. Desolate North has an extremely slow rhythm and has only limited vocals. The music is interspersed with various woodland sounds, such <b>as</b> <b>running</b> water and footsteps. The natural imagery used on the album is reminiscent of that used in black metal, but the music is closer to ambient.|$|E
5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, {{often called}} the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well <b>as</b> <b>running</b> plays.|$|E
5|$|A new county-designated highway {{appeared}} on maps {{for the first}} time in 1983, H-16; it was marked <b>as</b> <b>running</b> between US2 and M-28 only. This designation was removed in the 1985 edition of the map. The H-16 label reappeared in 1992; this time it was shown continuing south toward the Wisconsin state line and north to M-38, along the routing of FFH-16. The roadway is part of the Forest Highway System that is funded and administered by the US Forest Service and the Federal Highway Administration; the system was created by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. The highway has never been included in the CDH system as Iron, Houghton and Ontonagon counties do not participate in the system, and the Upper Peninsula east of US41 is the G zone, not the H zone.|$|E

5|$|Aidoo was {{designated}} as the backup running back out of training camp in 2005, with the Tiger-Cats electing to keep only the trio of Troy Davis, Aidoo, and fullback Julian Radlein on the roster <b>as</b> <b>running</b> backs. In August, Aidoo briefly stepped in for Davis after the latter suffered an injured hamstring. Through the first 11 regular season games, Aidoo made two special teams tackles and rushed for 51 yards on six carries. This led The Hamilton Spectator to speculate he would be dropped from the active roster in favor of recently signed running back Jesse Lumsden. After Troy {{was traded to the}} Eskimos, this never came to pass, and Aidoo started as a fullback for the last few games of the season. The Tiger-Cats did not make the playoffs. Aidoo finished the season with five special teams tackles and 116 rushing yards from 18 carries.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the history}} of Nazism's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s, the present German state has {{committed}} itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the German constitution. The BfV domestic intelligence service (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) regards the aims of Scientology <b>as</b> <b>running</b> counter to Germany's free and democratic order, and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997, as have the Offices for the Protection of the Constitution {{in a number of}} German Länder. Minister for Family Policy Claudia Nolte instituted the surveillance, saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose Scientology with all the means at her disposal.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his deformities, {{at some point during}} his childhood, Merrick suffered a fall and damaged his left hip. This injury became infected and left him permanently lame. Although affected by his physical deformities, Merrick attended school and enjoyed a close relationship with his mother. She was a Sunday school teacher, and his father worked as an engine driver at a cotton factory, as well <b>as</b> <b>running</b> a haberdashery business. On 29 May 1873, less than three years after the death of her youngest son William, Mary Jane Merrick died from bronchopneumonia. Joseph Rockley Merrick moved with his two children to live with Mrs. Emma Wood Antill, a widow with children of her own. They married on 3 December 1874.|$|E

5|$|In just {{its third}} season, the team {{finished}} with {{the best record in}} the league at 11–1–1 and was awarded the NFL title. In a 14-year span beginning in 1933, New York qualified to play in the NFL championship game eight times, winning twice (1934 and 1938). They did not win another championship until 1956, aided by several future Hall of Fame players such <b>as</b> <b>running</b> back Frank Gifford, linebacker Sam Huff, and offensive tackle Roosevelt Brown. From 1958 to 1963, the Giants played in the NFL championship game five times, but failed to win. The 1958 NFL Championship game, in which they lost 23–17 in overtime to the Baltimore Colts, is credited with increasing the popularity of the NFL in the United States.|$|E
5|$|M-87 is the {{designation}} of a former state trunkline highway in the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan, which prior to 1960 ran east–west between the towns of Fenton and Holly. The highway served as a connector between US Highway23 (US23) and the former routing of US10, which ran along {{what is now the}} Interstate75 (I-75) corridor. The highway connected the downtown areas of each community as well <b>as</b> <b>running</b> through then-rural areas of Genesee and Oakland counties. The trunkline was decommissioned in late 1960, removing it from the system.|$|E
5|$|The {{sport of}} {{track and field}} {{has its roots in}} human prehistory. Track and field-style events are among the oldest of all {{sporting}} competitions, <b>as</b> <b>running,</b> jumping and throwing are natural and universal forms of human physical expression. The first recorded examples of organized track and field events at a sports festival are the Ancient Olympic Games. At the first Games in 776 BC in Olympia, Greece, only one event was contested: the stadion footrace. The scope of the Games expanded in later years to include further running competitions, but the introduction of the Ancient Olympic pentathlon marked a step towards track and field as it is recognized today—it comprised a five-event competition of the long jump, javelin throw, discus throw, stadion footrace, and wrestling.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{coaching}} changes {{came about}} a month after the Orange Bowl. On February 14, the school announced that the son of head coach Frank Beamer, Shane Beamer, had been hired <b>as</b> <b>running</b> backs coach. He replaced Billy Hite, the longest-tenured assistant coach in the country, who took an administrative role with the team. Two days later, Tech replaced 62-year-old linebackers coach Jim Cavanaugh with 35-year-old Cornell Brown. On February 22, Tech announced that offensive coordinator Bryan Stinespring had been removed from play-calling duties and replaced by quarterbacks coach Mike O'Cain. Stinespring, who also was the team's associate head coach, was replaced in that capacity by Shane Beamer.|$|E
5|$|Women were {{expected}} to be strong, healthy and vital. The sturdy peasant woman who worked the land and bore strong children was considered ideal and athletic women were praised for being tanned from working outdoors. Organisations were created for the indoctrination of Nazi values and from 25 March 1939 membership in the Hitler Youth became compulsory for all children over the age of ten. The Jungmädelbund (Young Girls League) section of the Hitler Youth was for girls age 10 to 14 and the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM; League of German Girls) was for young women age 14 to 18. The BDM's activities focused on physical education, with activities such <b>as</b> <b>running,</b> long jumping, somersaulting, tightrope walking, marching and swimming.|$|E
5|$|At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Agnew, who {{had earlier}} {{been asked to}} place Richard Nixon's name in nomination, was {{selected}} <b>as</b> <b>running</b> mate by Nixon and his campaign staff. Agnew's centrist reputation interested Nixon, and the law and order stance he had taken {{in the wake of}} civil unrest that year appealed to aides such as Pat Buchanan. Agnew made a number of gaffes during the campaign, but his rhetoric pleased many Republicans, and he may have made the difference in several key states. Nixon and Agnew defeated the Democratic ticket, incumbent vice president, Hubert Humphrey for president, and his running mate, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. As vice president, Agnew was often called upon to attack the administration's enemies. In the years of his vice presidency, Agnew moved to the right, appealing to conservatives who were suspicious of moderate stances taken by Nixon. In 1972, Nixon and Agnew were reelected for a second term, defeating Senator George McGovern of South Dakota and former ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland.|$|E
