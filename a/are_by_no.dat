5|$|The {{contemporary}} {{discipline of}} sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic {{as a result}} of the contentions of classical social theory. In Randall Collins' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural (Simmel) and pragmatist (Mead, Cooley) theories of social interaction. Utilitarianism, also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with economics, is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by Raewyn Connell, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of Social Darwinism, which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means mutually exclusive.|$|E

They belong to a family of Elvish languages, that originate in Common Eldarin, the language common to all Eldar, which in turn originates in Primitive Quendian, the common root of Eldarin and Avarin languages.|$|E

25|$|Some {{studies suggest}} people with secure {{attachment}} styles have longer-lasting relationships. This may be {{partly due to}} commitment. People with secure attachment styles tend to express more commitment to their relationships. People with secure attachment styles {{also tend to be}} more satisfied with their relationships, which may encourage them to stay in their relationships longer. However, secure attachment styles <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means a guarantee of long-lasting relationships.|$|E

However, changing requirements <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means unusual in a large, expensive custom software project; they are a well-known factor in historical project failures, and methodologies such as agile software development have been developed to cope with them. Unfortunately, regulations pertaining to large government contracts in many countries, including the United States, are not a good match for agile software development.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{approaches are}} applied by interpreters {{specifically to the}} book of Revelation, but Revelation occupies such a central place in Christian eschatology that it is worth mentioning them in this, more general, overview. Parallel approaches {{can also be used}} in the interpretation of other prophetic passages. These approaches <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means mutually exclusive and are usually combined to form a more complete and coherent interpretation. Nevertheless, it is helpful to have a conceptual understanding of them.|$|E

25|$|Hippocrates {{described}} trigonocephaly as follows: Men's heads <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> {{means all}} like to one another, nor are the sutures {{of the head of}} all men constructed in the same form. Thus, whoever has a prominence in the anterior part of the head (by prominence is meant the round protuberant part of the bone which projects beyond the rest of it), in him the sutures of the head take the form of the Greek letter 'tau', τ.|$|E
25|$|The University teams have, naturally, {{emerged as}} among the weaker teams, but <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means the 'whipping boys' of the competition, having beaten teams such as Antrim in 2007, and the added {{experience}} against playing teams of such a high standard {{is expected to be}} beneficial to the University teams in the principle Gaelic football competition for Irish universities, the Sigerson Cup. This initiative seems to be bearing fruit, given that the 2007 Sigerson Cup final was contested by Queen's University and University of Ulster - historically, universities in the south of Ireland have dominated.|$|E
25|$|Raising the forelegs {{and holding}} the abdomen to one side <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means {{specific}} to courtship. This display occurs {{to a wide variety}} of objects that are approaching too close to the spider: other spiders - regardless of sex, houseflies or other large prey, models of prey that are about the size of the spider, such as 9–12mm spheres, or even the end of a finger or a pencil. In these situations, however, the spider with its forelegs raised and waving backs off while facing the moving object and, when 5–8cm away, turns away and flees.|$|E

25|$|Turning rules <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means universal. For example, in New Zealand (a drive-on-the-left country) between 1977 and 2012, left {{turning traffic}} had {{to give way to}} {{opposing}} right-turning traffic wishing to take the same road (unless there were multiple lanes, but then one must take care in case a vehicle jumped lanes). New Zealand abolished this particular rule on 25 March 2012, except at roundabouts or when denoted by a Give Way or Stop sign. Although the rule caused initial driver confusion, and many intersections required or still require modification, the change is predicted to eventually prevent one death and 13 serious injuries annually.|$|E
25|$|In 1961 Rotherham United {{played in}} the first League Cup Final, when they lost 3–2 to Aston Villa in two legs, they won the first 2–0, but lost the second 3–0. Yorkshire clubs compete in the English {{football}} league system. While they <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means the most dominant footballing county, Yorkshire has produced several national league winners, {{some of whom have}} won the title more than once, including Sheffield Wednesday, Leeds United, Huddersfield Town and Sheffield United. Some players from Yorkshire have gone on to become some of the most highly regarded {{in the history of the}} game, including World Cup-winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks and two time European Footballer of the Year award winner Kevin Keegan.|$|E
25|$|A matrimonial {{dispensation}} is {{the relaxation}} {{in a particular}} case of an impediment prohibiting or annulling a marriage. Matrimonial dispensations can be either to allow a marriage in the first place, or to dissolve one. It may be granted: (a) in favour of a contemplated marriage or to legitimize one already contracted; (b) in secret cases, or in public cases, or in both; (c) in foro interno only, or in foro externo (the latter includes also the former). Power of dispensing in foro interno is not always restricted to secret cases (casus occulti). These expressions <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means identical. When a matrimonial impediment is common to both parties the bishop, in dispensing his own subject, dispenses also the other.|$|E

25|$|If {{the reader}} has also {{received}} {{the benefit of}} the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means to be found there.|$|E
25|$|Although paleomagnetic {{evidence}} {{can be used}} to {{rule out}} the 1850s as the age of Cinder Cone, it does not provide an actual age for its eruption. By measuring levels of carbon-14 in samples of wood from trees killed by the eruption of Cinder Cone, USGS scientists obtained a radiocarbon date for the eruption of between 1630 and 1670. Such a date is also consistent with the remnant magnetization preserved in the lava flows. The series of eruptions that produced the volcanic deposits at Cinder Cone were complex and <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means completely understood. However, the new studies done by USGS scientists refute the purported accounts of an eruption in the early 1850s and confirm Diller’s (1891, 1893) interpretation that Cinder Cone erupted {{in the latter half of}} the 17th century. They also suggest that the 1666 tree-ring date proposed by Finch (1937) for his “second” explosive eruption at Cinder Cone might actually date the entire eruptive sequence.|$|E
500|$|Wallace opposed eugenics, an idea {{supported}} by other prominent 19th-century evolutionary thinkers, {{on the grounds}} that contemporary society was too corrupt and unjust to allow any reasonable determination of who was fit or unfit. In the 1890 article [...] "Human Selection" [...] he wrote, [...] "Those who succeed in the race for wealth <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means the best or the most intelligent...". In 1898, Wallace wrote a paper advocating a pure paper money system, not backed by silver or gold, which impressed the economist Irving Fisher so much that he dedicated his 1920 book Stabilizing the Dollar to Wallace.|$|E
