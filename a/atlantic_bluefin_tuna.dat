25|$|In a 2001 study, the {{movements}} of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> from an area off North Carolina were studied {{with the help of}} special popup tags. When attached to a tuna, these tags monitored {{the movements}} of the tuna for about a year, then freed themselves, and floated to the surface where they transmitted their information to a satellite. The study found that the tuna had four different migration patterns. One group confined itself to the western Atlantic for a year. Another group also stayed mainly in the western Atlantic, but migrated to the Gulf of Mexico for spawning. A third group moved across the Atlantic Ocean and back again. The fourth group crossed to the eastern Atlantic and then moved into the Mediterranean Sea for spawning. The study indicates that, while there is some differentiation by spawning areas, there is essentially only one population of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> intermixing groups that between them use all of the north Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that swimming in groups enhances foraging success. This ability was demonstrated by Pitcher and others {{in their study of}} foraging behaviour in shoaling cyprinids. In this study, the time it took for groups of minnows and goldfish to find a patch of food was quantified. The number of fishes in the groups was varied, and a statistically significant decrease in the amount of time necessary for larger groups to find food was established. Further support for an enhanced foraging capability of schools is seen in the structure of schools of predatory fish. Partridge and others analysed the school structure of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> from aerial photographs and found that the school assumed a parabolic shape, a fact that was suggestive of cooperative hunting in this species.|$|E
25|$|Fishing {{scenes are}} rarely {{represented}} in ancient Greek culture, {{a reflection of}} the low social status of fishing. However, Oppian of Corycus, a Greek author wrote a major treatise on sea fishing, the Halieulica or Halieutika, composed between 177 and 180. This is the earliest such work to have survived to the modern day. The consumption of fish varied in accordance with the wealth and location of the household. In the Greek islands and on the coast, fresh fish and seafood (squid, octopus, and shellfish) were common. They were eaten locally but more often transported inland. Sardines and anchovies were regular fare for the citizens of Athens. They were sometimes sold fresh, but more frequently salted. A stele of the late 3rd century BCE from the small Boeotian city of Akraiphia, on Lake Copais, provides us with a list of fish prices. The cheapest was skaren (probably parrotfish) whereas <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> was three times as expensive. Common salt water fish were yellowfin tuna, red mullet, ray, swordfish or sturgeon, a delicacy which was eaten salted. Lake Copais itself was famous in all Greece for its eels, celebrated by the hero of The Acharnians. Other fresh water fish were pike-fish, carp and the less appreciated catfish.|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{population}} {{structures of}} <b>Atlantic</b> northern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus thynnus thynnus) and albacore (T. alalunga) were examined using allozyme analysis. A total of 822 <b>Atlantic</b> northern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> from 18 different samples (16 Mediterranean, 1 East Atlantic, 1 West Atlantic) and 188 albacore from 5 samples (4 Mediterranean, 1 East Atlantic) were surveyed for genetic variation in 37 loci. Polymorphism and heterozygosity reveal a moderate level of genetic variability, {{with only two}} highly polymorphic loci in both <b>Atlantic</b> northern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (FH* and SOD- 1 *) and albacore (GPI- 3 * and XDH*). The level of population differentiation found for <b>Atlantic</b> northern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> and albacore fits the pattern that has generally been observed in tunas, with genetic differences on a broad rather than a more local scale. For <b>Atlantic</b> northern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> no spatial or temporal genetic heterogeneity was observed within the Mediterranean Sea or between the East Atlantic and Mediterranean, indicating {{the existence of a}} single genetic grouping on {{the eastern side of the}} Atlantic Ocean. Very limited genetic differentiation was found between West Atlantic and East Atlantic/Mediterranean northern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> mainly due to an inversion of SOD- 1 * allele frequencies. Regarding albacore, no genetic heterogeneity was observed within the Mediterranean Sea or between Mediterranean and Azores samples, suggesting the existence of a single gene pool in this area...|$|R

40|$|Long-distance {{migration}} {{is a widespread}} process evolved independently in several animal groups in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Many factors contribute to the migration process and of primary importance are intra-specific competition and seasonality in the resource distribution. Adaptive migration in direction of increasing fitness should lead to the ideal free distribution (IFD) which is the evolutionary stable strategy of the habitat selection game. We introduce a migration game which focuses on migrating dynamics leading to the IFD for age-structured populations and in time varying habitats, where dispersal is costly. The model predicts migration dynamics between these habitats and the corresponding population distribution. When applied to <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas,</b> it predicts their migration routes and their seasonal distribution. The largest biomass {{is located in the}} spawning areas which have also the largest diversity in the age-structure.

40|$|Tunas {{are highly}} {{specialized}} predators that have evolved numerous adaptations for {{a lifestyle that}} requires large amounts of energy consumption. Here we review {{our understanding of the}} bioenergetics and feeding dynamics of tunas on a global scale, with an emphasis on yellowfin, bigeye, skipjack, albacore, and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas.</b> Food consumption balances bioenergetics expenditures for respiration, growth (including gonad production), specific dynamic action, egestion, and excretion. Tunas feed across the micronekton and some large zooplankton. Some tunas appear to time their life history to take advantage of ephemeral aggregations of crustacean, fish, and molluscan prey. Ontogenetic and spatial diet differences are substantial, and significant interdecadal changes in prey composition have been observed. Diet shifts from larger to smaller prey taxa highlight ecosystem-wide changes in prey availability and diversity and provide implications for changing bioenergetics requirements into the future. Where tunas overlap, we show evidence of niche separation between them; resources are divided largely by differences in diet percentages and size ranges of prey taxa. The lack of long-term data limits the ability to predict impacts of climate change on tuna feeding behaviour. We note the need for systematic collection of feeding data as part of routine monitoring of these species, and we highlight the advantages of using biochemical techniques for broad-scale analyses of trophic relations. We support the continued development of ecosystem models, which all too often lack the regional-specific trophic data needed to adequately investigate climate and fishing impacts...|$|R

40|$|Aquaculture is {{providing}} an ever-increasing proportion {{of fish in}} the human food basket prompting a search for new species to expand the range available to consumers.

Consequently, there is considerable interest worldwide in developing the culture of large tunids, including <b>Atlantic</b> northern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus thynnus), Pacific <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus orientalis), southern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus maccoyii) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares).

This review summarises the rather fragmentary data that compromise the current state-of-the-art in relation to tuna nutrition and the development of artificial, formulated feeds for these species. In highlighting the various considerable challenges that feed development will pose, we discuss the future perspectives for tuna culture in terms of both fish and human nutrition and welfare, against the background of diminishing global marine resources...|$|R
