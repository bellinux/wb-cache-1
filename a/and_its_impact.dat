5|$|In {{response}} to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team assembles, boards two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and {{heads toward the}} location without gunship escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert the arriving forces, the Taliban insurgents shoot {{down one of the}} helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators who were on board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>impact</b> causes him to land {{at the bottom of a}} rock crevice where he is able to hide from the Taliban fighters.|$|E
5|$|Reaction to Super Columbine Massacre was {{enormously}} negative; {{the title was}} criticized as trivializing the actions of two murderers {{and the lives of}} the innocent. The game's cartoon presentation and the side-plot into hell were considered by critics as obscuring the game's message, but it received minor note as a game that transcended the stereotypical associations of the medium as entertainment for children. Super Columbine Massacres themes and content led to it being included in discussions as to whether video games cause violence; the title was later listed as one of the possible motivating factors of the shooter after the 2006 Dawson College shootings. The game has been described as an art game, and Ledonne has become a spokesperson for video games as an emerging art form, producing a documentary in 2008 called Playing Columbine about his game <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>impact.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Norwegian {{physician}} Dr C. Müller first associated {{the physical}} signs, high cholesterol levels and autosomal dominant inheritance in 1938. In the early 1970s and 1980s, the genetic cause for FH {{was described by}} Dr Joseph L. Goldstein and Dr Michael S. Brown of Dallas, Texas. Initially, they found increased activity of HMG-CoA reductase, but studies showed that this did not explain the very abnormal cholesterol levels in people with FH. The focus shifted to the binding of LDL to its receptor, and effects of impaired binding on metabolism; this {{proved to be the}} underlying mechanism for FH. Subsequently, numerous mutations in the protein were directly identified by sequencing. They later won the 1985 Nobel Prize in Medicine for their discovery of the LDL receptor <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>impact</b> on lipoprotein metabolism.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorials}} to World War I {{were shaped}} by the traumatic nature of the conflict <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>impact</b> on individuals and communities. The experience of the different nations varied considerably, but common themes emerged. The war required a mass call to arms, with {{a significant percentage of}} the population mobilised to fight, either as volunteers or through conscription. Campaigns were conducted on multiple fronts across Europe and beyond. The fighting was mechanised and conducted on an industrial scale; existing weapons, such as machine guns and artillery, were combined with the innovative deployment of aircraft, submarines and poison gas. In many theatres of operation, mobile campaigns degenerated into static trench warfare, depending on the slow attrition of the enemy over many years for victory. The battles spread across larger areas than ever before, with key engagements, such as that at Verdun etched on the memories of the nations involved.|$|E

40|$|The {{selection}} of climate policies {{should be an}} exercise in risk management reflecting the many relevant sources of uncertainty. Studies of climate change <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>impacts</b> rarely yield consensus {{on the distribution of}} exposure, vulnerability or possible outcomes. Hence policy analysis cannot effectively evaluate alternatives using standard approaches, such as expected utility theory and benefit-cost analysis. This Perspective highlights the value of robust decision-making tools designed for situations such as evaluating climate policies, where consensus on probability distributions is not available and stakeholders differ in their degree of risk tolerance. A broader risk-management approach enables a range of possible outcomes to be examined, as well as the uncertainty surrounding their likelihoods. The scientific understanding of climate change <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>impacts</b> has increased dramatically in recent years, but several interacting sources of uncertainty mean that future climate change <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>impacts</b> will not be known with precision for the foreseeable future. Some uncertainties involve the path of global socio-economic development, the way it affects the commitment by countries to use energy-efficient technologies and how greenhouse-gas emissions might respond to specific climate-related policies.
