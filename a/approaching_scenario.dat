CONFORM will be integrated {{as a driver}} model into the ibeo test vehicle during the project phase of EU–project HoliDes. The aim of CONFORM is to support the system designer to properly parameterize the default behavior of a highly automated vehicle to guarantee a high system acceptance. Thereby CONFORM addresses intra and inter individual differences in the driving behavior. CONFORM measures {{the difference between the}} default system behavior and the natural driving behavior of a human driver situation-dependent to determine the necessity of an adaptation. Based on a driving simulator study the paper describes how CONFORM is able to visualize and to cluster certain driving patterns/styles in a vehicle following/vehicle <b>approaching</b> <b>scenario.</b> We use the study results to derive recommendations for the design of the system behavior of highly automated vehicles...|$|E

According {{to the different}} measuring capabilities of cluster members, the master–slave coordinated relative navigation strategy for target localization with respect to slavery space robots is proposed; then the basic mathematical models, including coordinated relative measurement model and cluster centralized dynamics, are established respectively. By employing the linear Kalman filter theorem, the centralized estimator based on truth measurements is developed and analyzed firstly, and with an intention to inhabit the initial uncertainties related to target localization, the globally stabilized estimator is designed through introduction of pseudo measurements. Furthermore, the observability and controllability of stochastic system are also analyzed to qualitatively evaluate the convergence performance of pseudo measurement estimator. Finally, on-orbit target <b>approaching</b> <b>scenario</b> is simulated by using semi-physical simulation system, {{which is used to}} verify the convergence performance of proposed estimator. During the simulation, both the known and unknown maneuvering acceleration cases are considered to demonstrate the robustness of coordinated localization strategy...|$|E
30|$|However, {{there are}} {{weaknesses}} and limits associated with scenarios. Scenario planning have evolved from {{an emphasis on}} quantitative methods to an emphasis on qualitative methods, and even though scenario planning is supported by an increasing amount of tools, it will remain ‘a highly subjective art’ [28]. The main weakness of the quantitative methods is that they mostly rely on historical data and an assumption that past and current trends will continue into the future. This {{is in contrast to}} the perception of the future in literature such as McCarl et al. [9] and Milly et al. [10]. Quantitative methods are therefore usually not recommended for projects with long time horizons [28]. The longer the time horizon, the more suitable is the qualitative approach for scenario building. Also, quantitative analyses are primarily focused on the analysis and forecast of a single parameter, sometimes without taking into consideration how variables and parameters may impact each other. On the other hand, the primary weakness of the qualitative method lies in its subjective nature. The inclusion of humans and the human mindset will automatically lead to subjective input. There are ways to counteract this (the Delphi process, wide variety of experts included in scenario building), and recent literature [25] shows that the scenario approach can help to reduce bias in strategic planning. The recommended number of scenarios in literature varies, but it is recommended to build between three and six scenarios [28]. Generating more than five might be too costly though and will in most cases not be justifiable [28]. On the other hand, less than three scenarios might be too few because they will probably represent two extreme situations (best and worst case). Everything in between will be undefined. Having three scenarios might cause an unhealthy focus on the middle scenario (which is also the most probable) [28]. Choosing the appropriate number of scenarios is therefore critical, is not an easy feat and will involve the risk of choosing too few or too many. For building each specific scenario, the literature recommends using between three and eight factors, specified as uncertainties [28]. Scenarios are built of these factors, as also discussed extensively in section 4. Using less than three factors can simplify the situation too much, and relying on more than eight factors will lead to high scenario production costs. Furthermore, failing to produce plausible, internally consistent and relevant scenarios will render them unfit for use in scenario planning, showing that there are major concerns in the process besides facts and number of scenarios and factors. The focus on details in the scenario planning process is therefore fundamentally important, and shows that scenario building is not easily achieved, nor should it be taken lightly, otherwise biasing can occur. Meissner and Wulf [25] show that only a complete application of the scenario planning process can ensure their so called ‘debiasing’ effect. <b>Approaching</b> <b>scenario</b> planning in a simplified or reduced manner will therefore not assure users of a non-biased decision-making process, and is on this basis naturally not recommended.|$|E

40|$|The {{prospect}} of reducing environmental impacts {{is a key}} driver {{for the development of}} new wood-based products. But as wood-based products are not necessarily environmentally superior to non-wood alternatives, {{there is a need to}} assess the environmental impact of the product and guide the development process. The aim of this research is to improve the methodology of such environmental assessments, to better capture the inherent uncertainties of future, still non-existent product systems and to improve the impact assessment of forestry. For capturing uncertainties, two <b>approaches</b> for <b>scenario</b> modelling were used in life cycle assessments (LCAs) of wood-based roof constructions and textile fibres. In the first <b>approach,</b> <b>scenarios</b> were set up to explore how different future technologies and methodological approaches (consequential and attributional) influence the assessment of life cycle processes occurring in a distant and uncertain future. In the second <b>approach,</b> <b>scenarios</b> with different geographical locations for the life cycle processes were generated by varying the future demand for textile fibres and the competition for forest land. Both approaches generated results which differed significantly between the scenarios; thus the approaches enabled a more comprehensive assessment than if only one scenario had been set up. The approaches can be recommended particularly for assessments of long-lived products and products with globally distributed supply chains. For improving the impact assessment of forestry, methods suggested in the literature were used and further developed in an LCA of wood-based textile fibres. The methods captured the land use impact on biodiversity and the water use impact on human health, ecosystem quality and resources. A new inventory approach was developed to better capture the system-scale effects that forestry can have on the hydrological cycle. Besides identifying opportunities for further methodological improvements, the methods generated meaningful results beyond what is offered by established methods for impact assessment. In particular, the consequential inventory approach made it possible to discern that land use can contribute positively to downstream water availability under certain conditions...|$|R

Three ap-proaches to evidential reasoning have been prominent in the literature: argumentation, narrative and probabilistic rea-soning. In this paper a combination of the latter two is proposed. In recent research on Bayesian networks applied to legal cases, a number of legal idioms have been developed as re-curring structures in legal Bayesian networks.
