5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of <b>achromatic</b> lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E

25|$|Ladd-Franklin {{concluded}} that color vision evolved in three stages: <b>achromatic</b> vision (black and white), blue-yellow sensitivity and red-green sensitivity. Since red-green sensitivity {{was the last}} to evolve it explains why many people suffer from red-green color blindness. The next one that affects a small population is blue-yellow color blindness. Since <b>achromatic</b> vision was the first to evolve it explains why {{the majority of the population}} are not affected by black-white color blindness.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} very long focal length refracting {{telescope}} objectives was finally eliminated with {{the invention of the}} <b>achromatic</b> lens {{in the middle of the}} 18th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{telescope}} at New Berlin Observatory (1835–1913), that discovered Neptune, was an <b>achromatic</b> refractor of 9 Paris inch (9.6 English inches or 24.4cm) aperture {{made by the}} late Joseph Fraunhofer's firm, Merz und Mahler. It was a high-performance telescope of its era, {{with one of the}} largest <b>achromatic</b> doublets available and a finely made equatorial mount, with a clockwork drive to move the 4 m (13.4′) main tube in time with Earth's rotation. Eventually the telescope was moved to the Deutsches Museum in Munich, Germany, where it can still be seen in the 21st century as an exhibit.|$|E

25|$|The {{difficulty}} of procuring disks of glass (especially of flint glass) of suitable purity and homogeneity limited the diameter and light gathering {{power of the}} lenses found in the <b>achromatic</b> telescope. It was in vain that the French Academy of Sciences offered prizes for large perfect disks of optical flint glass.|$|E
25|$|The <b>achromatic</b> lens, which {{greatly reduced}} color aberrations in {{objective}} lenses and allowed for shorter and more functional telescopes, {{first appeared in}} a 1733 telescope made by Chester Moore Hall, who did not publicize it. John Dollond learned of Hall's invention and began producing telescopes using it in commercial quantities, starting in 1758.|$|E
25|$|He naturalised in France {{and stayed}} ten years, but his {{position}} became irksome, and at length intolerable. He, however, {{continued to work}} in the pursuit of science knowledge, and published many remarkable works. Among them was an elegant solution of the problem to determine the orbit of a comet from three observations and works on micrometre and <b>achromatic</b> telescopes.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} {{identification of}} organic bodies by their optical properties was treated in 1864; and later, {{in conjunction with}} the Rev. William Vernon Harcourt, he investigated the relation between the chemical composition and the optical properties of various glasses, with reference to the conditions of transparency and the improvement of <b>achromatic</b> telescopes. A still later paper connected with the construction of optical instruments discussed the theoretical limits to the aperture of microscope objectives.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to <b>achromatic</b> doublets {{is the use}} of diffractive optical elements. Diffractive optical elements are able to generate arbitrary complex wave fronts from a sample of optical material which is essentially flat. Diffractive optical elements have negative dispersion characteristics, complementary to the positive Abbe numbers of optical glasses and plastics. Specifically, in the visible part of the spectrum diffractives have a negative Abbe number of −3.5. Diffractive optical elements can be fabricated using diamond turning techniques.|$|E
25|$|Hall {{was a man}} of {{independent}} means and seems to have been careless of fame; at least he took no trouble to communicate his invention to the world. At a trial in Westminster Hall about the patent rights granted to John Dollond (Watkin v. Dollond), Hall was admitted to be the first inventor of the <b>achromatic</b> telescope. However, it was ruled by Lord Mansfield that it was not the original inventor who ought to profit from such invention, but the one who brought it forth for the benefit of mankind.|$|E
25|$|With the {{invention}} of the telescope and microscope {{there was a great deal}} of experimentation with lens shapes in the 17th and early 18th centuries trying to correct chromatic errors seen in lenses. Opticians tried to construct lenses of varying forms of curvature, wrongly assuming errors arose from defects in the spherical figure of their surfaces. Optical theory on refraction and experimentation was showing no single-element lens could bring all colours to a focus. This led to {{the invention}} of the compound <b>achromatic</b> lens by Chester Moore Hall in England in 1733, an invention also claimed by fellow Englishman John Dollond in a 1758 patent.|$|E
25|$|In 1747, Leonhard Euler {{sent to the}} Prussian Academy of Sciences a {{paper in}} which he tried to prove the {{possibility}} of correcting both the chromatic and the spherical aberration of a lens. Like Gregory and Hall, he argued that since the various humours of the human eye were so combined as to produce a perfect image, {{it should be possible}} by suitable combinations of lenses of different refracting media to construct a perfect telescope objective. Adopting a hypothetical law of the dispersion of differently colored rays of light, he proved analytically the possibility of constructing an <b>achromatic</b> objective composed of lenses of glass and water.|$|E
25|$|The Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS II, {{sometimes}} Second Palomar Sky Survey) {{was performed}} in the 1980s and 1990s that made use of better, faster films and an upgraded telescope. The Oschin Schmidt was given an <b>achromatic</b> corrector and provisions for autoguiding. Images were recorded in three wavelengths: blue (IIIaJ), red (IIIaF) and near infrared (IVN) plates, respectively. Observers on POSS II included C. Brewer, D. Griffiths, W. McKinley, J. Dave Mendenhall, K. Rykoski, Jeffrey L. Phinney and Jean Mueller (who discovered over 100 supernovae by comparing the POSS I and POSS II plates). Mueller also discovered several comets and minor planets {{during the course of}} POSS II and the bright Comet Wilson 1986 was discovered by then graduate student C. Wilson early in the survey.|$|E
25|$|The {{brilliance}} {{of lead crystal}} relies on the high refractive index caused by the lead content. Ordinary glass has a refractive index of n = 1.5, while the addition of lead produces a range up to 1.7 or 1.8. This heightened refractive index also correlates with increased dispersion, which measures {{the degree to which}} a medium separates light into its component spectra, as in a prism. Crystal cutting techniques exploit these properties to create a brilliant, sparkling effect as each cut facet reflects and transmits light through the object. The high refractive index is useful for lens making, since a given focal length can be achieved with a thinner lens. However, the dispersion must be corrected by other components of the lens system if it is to be <b>achromatic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} {{is caused}} by the dispersion of the lens material—the variation of its refractive index, n, with the wavelength of light. Since, from the formulae above, f is dependent upon n, it follows that light of different wavelengths is focused to different positions. Chromatic aberration of a lens is seen as fringes of colour around the image. It can be minimised by using an <b>achromatic</b> doublet (or achromat) in which two materials with differing dispersion are bonded together to form a single lens. This reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a certain range of wavelengths, though it does not produce perfect correction. The use of achromats was an important step {{in the development of the}} optical microscope. An apochromat is a lens or lens system with even better chromatic aberration correction, combined with improved spherical aberration correction. Apochromats are much more expensive than achromats.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{discussion}} {{as to whether}} achromats can see color or not. As illustrated in The Island of the Colorblind by Oliver Sacks, some achromats cannot see color, only black, white, and shades of grey. With five different genes currently known to cause similar symptoms, {{it may be that}} some do see marginal levels of color differentiation due to different gene characteristics. With such small sample sizes and low response rates, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the 'typical <b>achromatic</b> conditions'. If the light level during testing is optimized for them, they may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color. One common trait is hemeralopia or blindness in full sun. In patients with achromatopsia, the cone system and fibres carrying color information remain intact. This indicates that the mechanism used to construct colors is defective.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, {{improvements}} in the size and quality of telescope optics proved a significant advance in observation capability. Most notable among these enhancements was the two-component <b>achromatic</b> lens of the German optician Joseph von Fraunhofer that essentially eliminated coma—an optical effect that can distort {{the outer edge of the}} image. By 1812, Fraunhofer had succeeded in creating an <b>achromatic</b> objective lens [...] in diameter. The size of this primary lens is the main factor in determining the light gathering ability and resolution of a refracting telescope. During the opposition of Mars in 1830, the German astronomers Johann Heinrich Mädler and Wilhelm Beer used a [...] Fraunhofer refracting telescope to launch an extensive study of the planet. They chose a feature located 8° south of the equator as their point of reference. (This was later named the Sinus Meridiani, and it would become the zero meridian of Mars.) During their observations, they established that most of Mars' surface features were permanent, and more precisely determined the planet's rotation period. In 1840, Mädler combined ten years of observations to draw the first map of Mars. Rather than giving names to the various markings, Beer and Mädler simply designated them with letters; thus Meridian Bay (Sinus Meridiani) was feature [...] "a".|$|E
500|$|No known {{process in}} the {{universe}} can produce this much energy {{in such a short}} time. Rather, gamma-ray bursts are thought to be highly focused explosions, with most of the explosion energy collimated into a narrow jet. The approximate angular width of the jet (that is, the degree of spread of the beam) can be estimated directly by observing the <b>achromatic</b> [...] "jet breaks" [...] in afterglow light curves: a time after which the slowly decaying afterglow begins to fade rapidly as the jet slows and can no longer beam its radiation as effectively. Observations suggest significant variation in the jet angle from between 2 and 20 degrees.|$|E
2500|$|The {{opponent}} {{process model}} of the visual system is composed of two chromatic neural channels and one <b>achromatic</b> neural channel. [...] The chromatic channels consist of a red–green channel and a yellow–blue channel and are responsible for color and wavelength. [...] The <b>achromatic</b> channel is responsible for luminance, or white–black detection. [...] Hue and saturation are perceived due to varying amounts of activity in these neural channels consisting of axon pathways from retinal ganglion cells. These three channels are tied closely to reaction time in response to colors. [...] The <b>achromatic</b> neural channel has a faster response time than the chromatic neural channels under most conditions. [...] The functions of these channels are task-dependent. [...] Some activities are dependent on one channel or the other, as well as both channels. [...] When a colored stimulus is summed with white stimulus, both the chromatic and <b>achromatic</b> channels are activated. [...] The <b>achromatic</b> channel will have a slightly slowed response time, since it must adjust to the different luminance; however, despite this delayed response, {{the speed of the}} <b>achromatic</b> channel response time will still be faster than the speed of response of the chromatic channel. In these conditions of summed stimuli, the magnitude of the signal emitted by the <b>achromatic</b> channel will be stronger than of the chromatic channel. [...] The coupling of faster response with higher-amplitude signal from the <b>achromatic</b> channel means that reaction time will most likely depend on the luminance and saturation levels of the stimuli.|$|E
2500|$|If we take {{an image}} and extract the hue, saturation, and {{lightness}} or value components, and then compare these to {{the components of}} the same name as defined by color scientists, we can quickly see the difference, perceptually. For example, examine the following images of a fire breather (...) [...] The original is in the sRGB colorspace. [...] CIELAB L* is a CIE-defined <b>achromatic</b> lightness quantity (dependent solely on the perceptually <b>achromatic</b> luminance Y, but not the mixed-chromatic components X or Z, of the CIEXYZ colorspace from which the sRGB colorspace itself is derived), and it is plain that this appears similar in perceptual lightness to the original color image. Luma is roughly similar, but differs somewhat at high chroma, where it deviates most from depending solely on the true <b>achromatic</b> luminance (Y, or equivalently L*) and is influenced by the colorimetric chromaticity (x,y, or equivalently, a*,b* of CIELAB). [...] HSL L and HSV V, by contrast, diverge substantially from perceptual lightness.|$|E
2500|$|In optical instruments, {{dispersion}} {{leads to}} chromatic aberration; a color-dependent blurring that sometimes is the resolution-limiting effect. [...] This was {{especially true in}} refracting telescopes, before the invention of <b>achromatic</b> objective lenses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first person}} who succeeded in making a {{practical}} <b>achromatic</b> refracting telescope was Chester Moore Hall from Essex, England. He argued that the different humours of the human eye refract rays of light to produce an image on the retina which is free from color, and he reasonably argued {{that it might be}} possible to produce a like result by combining lenses composed of different refracting media. After devoting some time to the inquiry he found that by combining two lenses formed of different kinds of glass, he could make an <b>achromatic</b> lens where the effects of the unequal refractions of two colors of light (red and blue) was corrected. In 1733, he succeeded in constructing telescope lenses which exhibited much reduced chromatic aberration. One of his instruments had an objective measuring [...] with a relatively short focal length of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} edges in a crown graph is the pronic number n(n1). Its <b>achromatic</b> number is n: {{one can find}} a {{complete}} coloring by choosing each pair {u'i, v'i} {{as one of the}} color classes. Crown graphs are symmetric and distance-transitive. [...] describe partitions of the edges of a crown graph into equal-length cycles.|$|E
2500|$|There {{exists a}} point called {{the circle of}} least confusion, where {{chromatic}} aberration can be minimized. It can be further minimized by using an <b>achromatic</b> lens or achromat, in which materials with differing dispersion are assembled {{together to form a}} compound lens. The most common type is an <b>achromatic</b> doublet, with elements made of crown and flint glass. This reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a certain range of wavelengths, though it does not produce perfect correction. By combining more than two lenses of different composition, the degree of correction can be further increased, as seen in an apochromatic lens or apochromat. Note that [...] "achromat" [...] and [...] "apochromat" [...] refer to the type of correction (2 or 3 wavelengths correctly focused), not the degree (how defocused the other wavelengths are), and an achromat made with sufficiently low dispersion glass can yield significantly better correction than an achromat made with more conventional glass. Similarly, the benefit of apochromats is not simply that they focus 3 wavelengths sharply, but that their error on other wavelength is also quite small.|$|E
2500|$|HSL and HSV {{are both}} {{cylindrical}} geometries (...) , with hue, their angular dimension, {{starting at the}} red primary at 0°, passing through the green primary at 120° and the blue primary at 240°, and then wrapping back to red at 360°. In each geometry, the central vertical axis comprises the neutral, <b>achromatic,</b> or gray colors, ranging from black at lightness 0 or value 0, the bottom, to white at lightness 1 or value 1, the top.|$|E
2500|$|Neptune was {{discovered}} just after midnight, {{after less than}} an hour of searching and less than 1 degree from the position Le Verrier had predicted, a remarkable match. After two further nights of observations in which its position and movement were verified, Galle replied to Le Verrier with astonishment: [...] "the planet whose place you have [...] really exists" [...] (emphasis in original). The discovery telescope was an equatorial mounted <b>achromatic</b> refractor by Joseph Fraunhofer's firm Merz und Mahler.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the major}} {{contributions}} that Ladd-Franklin made to psychology was her theory of color vision, {{which was based on}} evolution. Ladd-Franklin noted that: [...] "some animals are color blind and assumed that <b>achromatic</b> vision appeared first in evolution and color vision came later." [...] She assumed further that the human eye carries fragments of its earlier evolutionary development. She observed that the most highly evolved part of the eye is the fovea, where, at least in daylight, visual acuity and color sensitivity are greatest. Ladd-Franklin assumed that peripheral vision (provided by the rods of the retina) was more primitive than foveal vision (provided by the cones of the retina) because night vision and movement detection are crucial for survival." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{customary}} {{explanations for}} color vision explain {{the difference in}} hue perception as elemental sensations that are inherent to the physiology of the observer. [...] However, no specific physiological constraints or theories {{have been able to}} explain the response to each unique hue. [...] To this end, both the observer’s spectral sensitivity and relative number of cone types have proven to not play any significant role in perceiving different hues. Perhaps the environment plays a larger role in the perception of unique hues than the different physiological features across individuals. [...] This is supported by the fact that color judgments can vary depending on differences in the color environment across long periods of time, but these same chromatic and <b>achromatic</b> judgments are held constant if the color environment is the same, despite aging and other individual physiological factors affecting the retina.|$|E
60|$|Then {{his head}} came through slowly with a {{surprised}} expression upon his face. He remembered. He remembered the {{thing as a}} bald discovery, and without a touch of emotion. With all the <b>achromatic</b> clearness, the unromantic colourlessness of the early morning....|$|E

'Well, we {{will get}} outside the solar system altogether,--leave the whole group of sun, primary and {{secondary}} planets quite behind us in our flight, as a bird might leave its bush and sweep into the whole forest.

6000|$|Not I. 'We {{see through}} a glass darkly,' said St. Paul of old; and what is more, dazzle and weary our eyes, like clumsy microscopists, by looking too long and earnestly through the {{imperfect}} and by no means <b>achromatic</b> lens. Enough. I will think of something else. I will think of nothing at all - ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the skill}} of the {{microscope}} makers {{of the eighteenth century}} soon reached its limit. A microscope magnifying 400 diameters was a chef d'oeuvre of the opticians of that day; and, at the same time, by no means trustworthy. But a magnifying power of 400 diameters, even when definition reaches the exquisite perfection of our modern <b>achromatic</b> lenses, hardly suffices for the mere discernment of the smallest forms of life. A speck, only 1/25th of an inch in diameter, has, at ten inches from the eye, the same apparent size as an object 1/10000th of an inch in diameter, when magnified 400 times; but forms of living matter abound, the diameter of which is not more than 1/40000th of an inch. A filtered infusion of hay, allowed to stand for two days, will swarm with living things among which, any which reaches the diameter of a human red blood- corpuscle, or about 1/3200th of an inch, is a giant. It is only by bearing these facts in mind, that we can deal fairly with the remarkable statements and speculations put forward by Buffon and Needham {{in the middle of the}} eighteenth century.|$|E
60|$|When we {{mounted the}} gangway of the Jumna at Suez, {{and began the}} process of frizzling down the Red Sea, I noted on deck almost at once an odd-looking young man of twenty-two or thereabouts, with a curious faint pea-green complexion. He was the wishy-washiest young man I ever beheld in my life; an <b>achromatic</b> study: {{in spite of the}} {{delicate}} pea-greeniness of his skin, all the colouring matter of the body seemed somehow to have faded out of him. Perhaps he had been bleached. As he leant over the taffrail, gazing down with open mouth and vacant stare at the water, I took a good long look at him. He interested me much--because he was so exceptionally uninteresting; a pallid, anæmic, indefinite hobbledehoy, with a high, narrow forehead, and sketchy features. He had watery, restless eyes of an insipid light blue; thin, yellow hair, almost white in its paleness; and twitching hands that played nervously all the time with a shadowy moustache. This shadowy moustache seemed to absorb as a rule the best part of his attention; it was so sparse and so blanched that he felt it continually--to assure himself, no doubt, of the reality of its existence. I need hardly add that he wore an eye-glass.|$|E
