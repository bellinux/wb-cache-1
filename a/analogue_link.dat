These lesions are considered to be therapeutically relevant and responsible for the efficacy of bifunctional alkylating agents in cancer chemotherapy. There is considerable evidence that indicates interstrand cross-links are recognized by cells and that this recognition can either mediate repair of damage and survival, or accelerate cell death. Development of tumors resistant to these agents {{is an important factor in}} the lack of response by some patients to therapy with these agents. Relatively little is known about the mechanism by which interstrand cross-links are recognized and repaired. In order to investigate repair mechanisms, interstrand cross-linked DNA substrates of well defined structure are required.

At VC, /Gly(8) /-AII was completely removed from all resins in less than 6 h, but the hydrophobic Plies moiety-containing All sequence was only partially cleaved (not more than 15 %) from BHAR or MBHAR in this period. At 25 degreesC, /Gly(8) /-AII cleavage time decreased to less than 2 h irrespective of the solid support. and quantitative removal of All from PAMR and MBHAR occurred in less than 3 h. However, about 10 - 15 h seemed to be necessary for cleavage of All from BHAR, and in this extended cleavage reaction {{a significant increase in}} peptide degradation rate was observed. Regardless of the cleavage temperature used, the decreasing order of acid stability measured for resins was BHAR > MBHAR > PAMR. Collectively, these findings demonstrated the feasibility of applying TFMSA/TFA solution as a substitute for anhydrous HF at the cleavage step in Boc-SPPS methodology. Care should be taken however, as the cleavage efficacy depends on multiple factors including the resin, peptide sequence. the time and temperature of reaction.

In order to find the best suitable chelator for labelling of AMBA, we synthesized AMBA <b>analogues</b> <b>linked</b> to the most commonly used chelators DOTA, NOTA and NODAGA and compared their reactivity and stability after labelling with 68 -Gallium. METHODS: For the synthesis of DO 3 A-, NO 2 A- and NODAGA-AMBA, a solid-phase synthesis approach was used. The influence of concentration, pH and temperature on the radiolabelling was analysed. The in vitro stability of all complexes in saline, human serum, human whole blood and against transchelation and transmetallation was analysed. RESULTS: The peptides were synthesised in high yield and purity. Purity and identity of products and impurities were confirmed using UHPLC coupled to ESI-MS. Radiolabelling of these peptides was optimal at elevated temperature, although room temperature labelling was reported previously for NOTA and NODAGA chelators. The highest reactivity was observed for NODAGA-AMBA. On preparation of NO 2 A-AMBA, the formation of a by-product was detected with HPLC. More detailed analysis revealed the formation of an isomer with the same mass to charge ratio which led to the conclusion that a coordination isomer was formed. All complexes showed high stability in saline, human serum or when challenged with DTPA, transferrin and varying metals (Fe(3 +), Cu(2 +), Zn(2 +)). Conversely, the stability in human blood was low, and varying metabolites were detected and identified by ESI-MS. CONCLUSION: All three precursors are available in high yields suitable for routine production.
