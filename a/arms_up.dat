He was appointed a 4th Class Member of the Royal Victorian Order (an honour now known as Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order) in 1969 for his services at the Investiture of the Prince of Wales. This was followed by a promotion to Commander of the Royal Victorian Order at the 1984 New Year Honours Though most Kings of <b>Arms</b> <b>up</b> to that time were knighted, that honour was never given to him. The closest that he came was in 1975 when he was made a Knight of Justice of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, the British revival of the ancient Knights Hospitaller of Saint John.|$|E

25|$|Active {{treatments}} are light repetitive exercises that work {{the area to}} maintain normality. Basic information is also given to teach the patient that exercises as instructed will not cause any damage to their neck. These exercises are done at home or {{under the care of}} a health professional. When beginning a rehabilitation regimen, it's important to begin with slow movements which include cervical rotation until pain threshold three to five times per day, flexion and extension of the shoulder joint by moving the <b>arms</b> <b>up</b> and down two to three times, and combining shoulder raises while inhaling and releasing the shoulder raise while exhaling. Soderlund and colleagues also recommend that these exercises should be done every day until pain starts to dissipate. Early mobilization is important for preventing chronic pain, but pain experienced from these exercises might cause psychological symptoms that could have negative impact on recovery. Rosenfeld found that doing active exercises as often as once every waken hour during one month after trauma decreases the need for sick leave three years after trauma from 25% to 5.7%.|$|E
25|$|After {{a strong}} {{start to the}} 2008–09 season, in which he earned a second Molson Cup in November, Price injured his ankle on December 30, 2008. Forced out of action for nearly a month, during which he was voted in as a {{starting}} goalie for the 2009 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal (along with teammates Alexei Kovalev, Andrei Markov and Mike Komisarek) he made his return to action on January 20, 2009, after backup Jaroslav Halák was pulled in a 4–2 loss to the Atlanta Thrashers. Going into the 2009 playoffs as the eighth and final seed, the Canadiens played the Boston Bruins in the opening round {{for the second consecutive}} season. They were swept in four games, with the Bruins scoring at least four times in each game. In the final game at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Price surrendered four goals in two periods. After stopping a weak dump-in, the crowd cheered sarcastically and Price responded by putting his <b>arms</b> <b>up</b> in the air, similar to Patrick Roy's gesture on December 2, 1995, in a game after which Roy requested a trade from the Canadiens.|$|E

500|$|... {{refers to}} a motion that pulls a {{structure}} or part away from the midline of the body. In the case of fingers and toes, it refers to spreading the digits apart, away from the centerline of the hand or foot. Abduction of the wrist is also called radial deviation. For example, raising the <b>arms</b> <b>up,</b> such as when tightrope-walking, {{is an example of}} abduction at the shoulder.

500|$|An {{observer}} in {{an accelerated}} reference frame must introduce what physicists call fictitious forces {{to account for}} the acceleration experienced by himself and objects around him. One example, the force pressing the driver of an accelerating car into his or her seat, has already been mentioned; another is the force you can feel pulling your <b>arms</b> <b>up</b> and out if you attempt to spin around like a top. [...] Einstein's master insight was that the constant, familiar pull of the Earth's gravitational field is fundamentally the same as these fictitious forces. [...] The apparent magnitude of the fictitious forces always appears to be proportional to the mass of any object on which they act – for instance, the driver's seat exerts just enough force to accelerate the driver {{at the same rate as}} the car. [...] By analogy, Einstein proposed that an object in a gravitational field should feel a gravitational force proportional to its mass, as embodied in Newton's law of gravitation.|$|E

500|$|Mother's Milk {{instantly}} garnered {{more attention}} than the band's previous records and, as such, the venues the band performed in were able to accommodate far larger crowds. For {{the first time the}} band also upgraded to a full-fledged tour bus and added backup musicians and singers. Longtime friend, Keith [...] "Tree" [...] Barry was added to play horns and backup singers Kristen Vigard and Vicki Calhoun (who appeared in the video for [...] "Knock Me Down") also joined the tour. When the band hit England, roadie Robbie Allen (nicknamed Rob Rule) would open for the band providing a comedy performance in which he would pretend to cut off his own penis. Allen would later become one of the band's backup singers on the One Hot Minute tour. The album's official launch, however, was held in New York City at a club called Tramps; following this, Red Hot Chili Peppers embarked on an introductory European tour which included a free show in Amsterdam's Dam Square that attracted over 10,000 attendees. On September 8, 1989 the band commenced their North American leg in Seattle. The leg saw an overwhelmingly positive response from critics across the country; following a concert in Portland, journalist John Foyston of The Oregonian noted the [...] "Hollywood-based quartet fomented an audience reaction that had to be seen to be believed. The stage-divers started rushing the stage from the moment the band walked on. Once on stage, it was an issue of luck and chutzpah." [...] Todd Caudle of the Colorado Springs newspaper The Gazette said the Chili Peppers' performance at the Colorado Indoor Sports Complex was [...] "the kind of place where kids could be kids, and no one cared if soft drinks stuck to the floor and the rafters shook with a stunning barrage of decibels. People in the audience, steeped in sweat and pressing against the barricade in front of the stage, threw their <b>arms</b> <b>up</b> in unison and barked out approval of one fast, furiously-played song after another." ...|$|E

He based his account on an interview with Crazy Horse's rival, Little Big Man, who was present at Crazy Horse's arrest and wounding. The interview took place over a year after Crazy Horse's death. [...] Little Big Man said that, as Crazy Horse was being escorted to the guardhouse, he suddenly pulled two knives from under his blanket and held one in each hand. One knife was reportedly fashioned from an army bayonet. Little Big Man, standing behind him, seized Crazy Horse by both elbows, pulling his <b>arms</b> <b>up</b> behind him. As Crazy Horse struggled, Little Big Man lost his grip on one elbow, and Crazy Horse drove his own knife deep into his own lower back. The guard stabbed Crazy Horse with his bayonet in the back. The chief fell and surrendered to the guards.|$|E

2500|$|A {{standing}} back handspring {{begins with}} a three phase sequence known as [...] "up, sit, jump". In the up phase, the gymnast stands up straight on flat feet, with arms in front at an angle slightly above horizontal. In the sit phase, the gymnast swings the arms down by {{the sides of the}} torso, bends knees, and sits back as if sitting in a chair; while in this position, the gymnast is unbalanced. Together, the sit and jump phases impart angular momentum to the body, causing it to rotate. In the jump phase, the gymnast swings both <b>arms</b> <b>up</b> by the ears and jumps into the air while transitioning to an arch position, with the head in a neutral position, arms and legs straight, and feet together; this body shape is maintained until the hands contact the floor. With hands on the floor, the body's angular momentum is used to transform the gymnast's body shape from an arch, through a linear shape, to a [...] "hollow" [...] shape. The hands are then pushed against the floor, causing the body to lift off from the floor while the body continues its feet-first rotation. Finally, the feet land on the floor, behind the body's center of gravity, and the remaining angular momentum is depleted as it carries the gymnast to a stationary standing position.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plant and}} take off is {{initiated}} typically three steps out from the final step. Vaulters will usually count their steps backwards from their starting point to the box only counting the steps taken on the left foot (vice versa for left-handers) except for the second step from the box, which is taken by the right foot. For example; a vaulter on a [...] "ten count" [...] (referring {{to the number of}} counted steps from the starting point to the box) would count backwards from ten, only counting the steps taken with the left foot, until the last three steps taken and both feet are counted as three, two, one. These last three steps are normally quicker than the previous strides and are referred to as the [...] "turn-over". The goal of this phase is to efficiently translate the kinetic energy accumulated from the approach into potential energy stored by the elasticity of the pole, and to gain as much initial vertical height as possible by jumping off the ground. The plant starts with the vaulter raising their <b>arms</b> <b>up</b> from around the hips or mid-torso until they are fully outstretched above the head, with the right arm extended directly above the head and the left arm extended perpendicular to the pole (vice versa for left-handed vaulters). At the same time, the vaulter is dropping the pole tip into the box. On the final step, the vaulter jumps off the trail leg which should always remain straight and then drives the front knee forward. As the pole slides {{into the back of the}} box the pole begins to bend and the vaulter continues up and forward, leaving the trail leg angled down and behind.|$|E
2500|$|Suárez {{returned}} from his ban on 6 February against Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League, coming on as a substitute in a 0–0 draw at Anfield; Dalglish reacted to his return by saying [...] "It's fantastic to have him back. He {{should never have been}} out in the first place". Ahead of the 11 February game between United and Liverpool at Old Trafford, the Premier League stated that the formal pre-match handshake would go ahead, Ferguson stated that he thought Evra should shake Suárez's hand, while Dalglish stated that Suárez would too. However, during the traditional pre-game handshakes, Suárez appeared to avoid Evra's hand, leading to Evra grabbing Suárez's arm. Suárez ignored Evra and continued down the line causing Evra to throw his <b>arms</b> <b>up</b> in protest and Rio Ferdinand to also avoid shaking Suárez's hand. Despite Liverpool ordering Suárez not to talk about the racial abuse incident, Suárez continued to discuss it. In May 2012, Suárez called his suspension [...] "strange and unbelievable" [...] and said that there was [...] "not a single convincing proof that [...] had done any of the things they accused [...] of doing"; he also denied that he had refused to shake Evra's hand. In 2014, Suárez released his autobiography Crossing the Line, in which he continued to deny the verdict that he had racially abused Evra, stating [...] "what some people will never want to accept is that the argument took place in Spanish. I did not use the word [...] "negro" [...] the way it can be used in English", despite admitting that the word [...] "negro" [...] means [...] "black". He also complained about the after-effects, saying the verdict that he was a racist would be [...] "a stain on my character that will probably be there forever".|$|E
