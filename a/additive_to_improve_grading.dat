40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This study {{examines}} how a township school responded to external pressure and support <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>grade</b> 12 results, in general, and mathematics in particular. The study is theoretically located within scholarship pertaining to forms {{and effects of}} accountability measures. The focus is on whether responses to such measures are substantive, i. e. directed towards the goal of general improvement of learning and teaching within the school, or non-substantive, i. e. directed towards compliance with external quantitatively framed measures {{as an end in}} itself. The general methodological approach was a case study with ethnographic elements. Data collection strategies included interviews and observation. In general, this study shows that the responses within the school to pressure and support <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> mathematics results were complex, uneven and layered. These external pressures did, often indirectly, contribute <b>to</b> <b>improved</b> <b>grade</b> 12 results. This was facilitated by a degree of internal coherence within leadership practices, i. e. effective and purposeful strategies aligned with substantive goals within the school...|$|R
