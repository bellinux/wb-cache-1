500|$|Mount Ślęża {{formation}} is believed {{by many to}} have been a place of exceptional cult significance, over many centuries, possibly going back {{all the way to the}} Lusatian times, but especially for the Celts. Chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg mentions in the early 11th century the mountain as a place surrounded by adoration because of its size and the [...] "cursed" [...] pagan ceremonies carried out there. The summits of this and of the neighboring mountains are circled by stone rings and monumental sculptures. Diagonalized cross signs found on many of the stone objects may have had their origin in the Hallstatt - Lusatian solar cult. Such signs can also be seen on the massive [...] "monk" [...] stone sculpture (<b>actually</b> <b>looking</b> more like a simple chess figure or a skittles pin) that was located inside the largest stone ring on Mount Ślęża itself and is therefore believed to originate from the Hallstatt cultural circles. The stone rings also contain fragments of Lusatian ceramics. The younger sculptures ("Maiden with a fish", [...] "Mushroom" [...] and the bear figures) have their distant counterparts in the Iberian Peninsula Celtic art and are thought to be the work of the Celtic people, who developed the Ślęża cult center further. After that the Mount Ślęża area cult was probably revived by the Slavs, who arrived here in early Middle Ages.|$|E

2500|$|One {{group of}} {{researchers}} in the United States found in the late 1990s and 2000s that the traditional way of reading to children made little difference in their later ability to read, and hypothesized this was because children spend relatively little time <b>actually</b> <b>looking</b> at the text.

2500|$|During {{the last}} few seconds, the {{aircraft}} climbed to 3,090 feet. The Captain put in 52 degrees of bank to turn the aircraft, and also made some nose down inputs. Therefore, the aircraft pitched down, speed increased and auto thrust commanded the engines to spool down to keep airspeed on the target speed. The aircraft started to descend at a high rate. Unfortunately in his panic, the Captain continued to move the heading knob without <b>actually</b> <b>looking</b> at it, but failed to pull the knob to activate it. When he did activate it, the aircraft turned towards the heading knob that had been rotated too far, to 25 degrees, and stayed on that course until end of recording.

2500|$|The {{connection}} {{was made in}} Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo's Historia general y natural de las Indias of 1535, in which he wrote that Ponce de León {{was looking for the}} waters of Bimini to regain youthfulness. Some researchers have suggested that Oviedo's account may have been politically inspired to generate favor in the courts. A similar account appears in Francisco López de Gómara's Historia general de las Indias of 1551. In the Memoir of Hernando d'Escalante Fontaneda in 1575, the author places the restorative waters in Florida and mentions de León looking for them there; his account influenced Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas' unreliable history of the Spanish in the New World. Fontaneda had spent seventeen years as an Indian captive after being shipwrecked in Florida as a boy. In his Memoir he tells of the curative waters of a lost river he calls [...] "Jordan" [...] and refers to de León looking for it. However, Fontaneda makes it clear he is skeptical about these stories he includes, and says he doubts de León was <b>actually</b> <b>looking</b> for the fabled stream when he came to Florida.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{featured in the}} March 21, 2012 issue of Kerrang! magazine, Bennington stated that the band has returned to more 'familiar' territory on their new record, saying [...] "with this [...] album, we've incorporated a lot of guitar work with big choruses and the heavier electronic stuff to give it that really big wall of sound feeling without getting too metal. This will be more familiar to people than A Thousand Suns was, where we were like 'Fuck it, we're {{just going to go}} bonkers." [...] Bennington also said that the new album's lyrics would be personal and avoid being political, adding [...] "We've been writing a lot about relationships." [...] Bennington and Shinoda echoed similar statements during {{an interview}} with Spin, with the former commenting that [...] "We now know we have the skills and the tools to take those ideas and make them into what we're <b>actually</b> <b>looking</b> for, as opposed to getting into it and discovering that it just sounds really nü-metal. That's always going to be gross to us, but we can take elements of that and reinvent the vibe, make it new and fresh." [...] The two previewed five songs from the album, as well as announced that they had collaborated with Canadian musician Owen Pallett. The vocalists also stated that they have adopted numerous influences and topics for the album, particularly about people.|$|E
2500|$|Abé Mark Nornes, in {{an essay}} {{entitled}} [...] "The Riddle of the Vase: Ozu Yasujirō's Late Spring (1949)," [...] observes: [...] "Nothing in all of Ozu's films has sparked such conflicting explanations; everyone seems compelled {{to weigh in on}} this scene, invoking it as a key example in their arguments." [...] Nornes speculates that {{the reason for this is}} the scene's [...] "emotional power and its unusual construction. The vase is clearly essential to the scene. The director not only shows it twice, but he lets both shots run for what would be an inordinate amount of time by the measure of most filmmakers." [...] To one commentator, the vase represents [...] "stasis," [...] and is thus [...] "an expression of something unified, permanent, transcendent." [...] Another critic describes the vase and other Ozu [...] "still lifes" [...] as [...] "containers for our emotions." [...] Yet another specifically disputes this interpretation, identifying the vase as [...] "a non-narrative element wedged into the action." [...] A fourth scholar sees it as an instance of the filmmaker's deliberate use of [...] "false POV" [...] (point of view), since Noriko is never shown <b>actually</b> <b>looking</b> at the vase the audience sees. A fifth asserts that the vase is [...] "a classic feminine symbol." [...] And yet another suggests several alternative interpretations, including the vase as [...] "a symbol of traditional Japanese culture," [...] and as an indicator of Noriko's [...] "sense that... relationship with her father has been changed." ...|$|E

2500|$|He was a figurative painter. (Aidan Dunne: [...] "He was a {{representational}} artist {{through and}} through...Fidelity to visual experience above all.") Though his style changed considerably over the years, his essential personality {{as an artist}} never did. He was plainly {{not interested in the}} formalist aspects of Modernism. He wanted art to have an expressive, emotive, even psychological content, though not in any literary sense. Anthony Cronin: [...] "He was never in any doubt that painting was a re-creation of what the painter saw: in his own case at least not what the painter had seen or could imagine, but what he was <b>actually</b> <b>looking</b> at during the act of painting. A faithfulness of the sort was part of the bargain, part of his contract with his art… [...] {{had nothing to do with}} description…What was at stake was a faithful recreation of the truth to the artist of the experience, in the painter’s case the visual experience, the artist being admittedly only one witness, one accomplice during and after the fact. Of course this faithfulness did not rule out expressionist overtones. The truth was doubtless subjective as well as objective. Swift's blues and greys were usually properties of what he was painting. They were also part of his vision of things, properties of his mind. We felt then that time could only find its full expression through an art that was frugal, ascetic, puritanical even." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011, Lewis {{said the}} album {{would be more}} {{experimental}} than Spirit and Echo, embodying a [...] "different" [...] yet [...] "classic" [...] sound. She added, [...] "I'm really, really excited about it. I'm working with some new producers, some up and coming people and it's going {{to be kind of}} a different sound – but still classic". Lewis suggested the album would be [...] "a bit different from what people have heard" [...] from her before, adding that she planned to [...] "go in and create and just see what happens". Lewis later described the album as [...] "more progressive", [...] "more eclectic", [...] "more uptempo" [...] and [...] "a bit darker". The Sun reported that the album had taken a dubstep direction, with songwriters asked to submit dance songs and no ballads. The song [...] "Come Alive" [...] experiments with dubstep and drum and bass. Lewis stated that the song was inspired by the [...] "dirty and heavy" [...] music sound of British electronica band Faithless. She also commented, [...] "We wanted to do an uptempo song, but for it to remain true to what I do". In March 2012, after extending the album's recording sessions, Lewis elaborated on the evolution of her sound, [...] "I've got a track that's got a bit of drum 'n' bass at the end. It's quite different to what I've had out before." [...] Lewis then went on to add [...] "I've got a track that's very '90s. It's just different influences that I've had through my life growing up. I'm really <b>actually</b> <b>looking</b> forward to people hearing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, {{coming off}} {{the heels of the}} {{conflict}} with Hannibal, Rome was preparing to embark on another military mission, this time in Greece. While they would eventually move on Philip V in the Second Macedonian War, there was considerable debate beforehand about the course Rome should take in this conflict. In the article [...] "Bellum Philippicum: Some Roman and Greek Views Concerning the Causes of the Second Macedonian War", E. J. Bickerman writes that [...] "the causes of the fateful war ... were vividly debated among both Greeks and Romans". Under the guise of protecting allies, Bickerman tells us, Rome was <b>actually</b> <b>looking</b> to expand its power and control eastward now that the Second Punic War was ended. But starting this war would not be an easy task considering those recent struggles with Carthage—many Romans were too tired of conflict to think of embarking on another campaign. As W. M. Owens writes in his article [...] "Plautus' Stichus and the Political Crisis of 200 B.C.", [...] "There is evidence that antiwar feeling ran deep and persisted even after the war was approved." [...] Owens contends that Plautus was attempting to match the complex mood of the Roman audience riding the victory of the Second Punic War but facing {{the beginning of a new}} conflict. For instance, the characters of the dutiful daughters and their father seem obsessed over the idea of officium, the duty one has to do what is right. Their speech is littered with words such as pietas and aequus, and they struggle to make their father fulfill his proper role. The stock parasite in this play, Gelasimus, has a patron-client relationship with this family and offers to do any job in order to make ends meet; Owens puts forward that Plautus is portraying the economic hardship many Roman citizens were experiencing due to the cost of war.|$|E
