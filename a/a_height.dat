5|$|The {{meteoroid}} grazed Earth's atmosphere quite gently (in comparison to, for example, the 1972Great Daylight Fireball {{above the}} United States and Canada). It became visible north of Uherský Brod, Czechoslovakia, at <b>a</b> <b>height</b> of 103.7km, approaching the Earth's surface to 98.67km northeast of Wrocław, Poland, and disappearing from sight at <b>a</b> <b>height</b> of 100.4km north of Poznań, Poland.

5|$|The {{meteoroid}} was a typeI fireball, i.e. {{an ordinary}} chondrite. When it entered Earth's atmosphere its mass was about 44kg, which was estimated {{on the basis}} of the measured values of its absolute magnitude and velocity. It lost approximately 350g during the encounter. Computer simulations showed that it started losing mass approximately at the moment it became visible to the cameras of the European Fireball Network, at <b>a</b> <b>height</b> of 100.6km. It lost mass for 25 seconds, until it reached <b>a</b> <b>height</b> of 215.7km. Its surface melted and solidified again after leaving, which means its surface became a typical meteoritic fusion crust.|$|E
