5|$|Expansion of US113 to {{a divided}} highway {{began in the}} 1950s in Dover. Much of the {{remainder}} of the U.S. Highway in Delaware was expanded in the 1960s; the final section of two-lane US113 in that state was expanded in the mid-1990s. The Berlin bypass became the first section of US113 in Maryland to be expanded to a divided highway in the mid-1950s. In the early 1970s, US113 between Pocomoke City and Snow Hill was expanded to a divided highway <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snow</b> Hill bypass was constructed, replacing what would become US113Business. The U.S. Highway between Berlin and the Delaware state line was expanded to a divided highway around 2000. The Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) is upgrading the last remaining two-lane portions of US113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four-lane divided highway. US113's northern terminus was moved to Milford in 2004 after the U.S. Highway was superseded by DE1 from Milford to Dover. The Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) plans to upgrade US113 to a freeway from Selbyville to Ellendale; a freeway bypass of Milford was cancelled in 2008 because of community opposition.|$|E

25|$|However, {{early on}} February 16, heavy snow started falling {{in those two}} cities, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> later {{developed}} in Philadelphia. Heavy snow was continuously reported, falling at rates of up to 4inches (10cm) per hour. In addition, temperatures were frigid, around 15°F (-10°C). The heavy snow continued all day, and it developed in New York City by the evening. At about the same time, the snow changed to sleet in Washington, D.C., and significantly lowered the accumulation. Throughout {{the rest of the}} Northeast, however, the snow continued for much of the night. The sleet changed back to snow by the next morning in Washington, D.C., and soon ended. By that time, a secondary low pressure system formed off the North Carolina coast and traveled north, turning the storm into a nor'easter for New York City and Boston. Blizzard Warnings were issued, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> began in Boston that day. In the evening, the heavy snow ended in New York City, and ended in Boston the morning of February 18. After that, the storm weakened and brought a few inches of snow to other parts of New England. The blizzard left the East Coast of the United States on February 19 and moved out into the North Atlantic Ocean. The storm weakened until it was completely absorbed by other systems on February 22.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the real}} birth of Russian opera came with Mikhail Glinka {{and his two}} great operas A Life for the Tsar (1836) and Ruslan and Lyudmila (1842). After him, in the 19th century in Russia, there were written such operatic masterpieces as Rusalka and The Stone Guest by Alexander Dargomyzhsky, Boris Godunov and Khovanshchina by Modest Mussorgsky, Prince Igor by Alexander Borodin, Eugene Onegin and The Queen of Spades by Pyotr Tchaikovsky, <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Snow</b> Maiden and Sadko by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{literature}} {{was seen as}} a way to influence society. Known as the Modern Breakthrough, this movement was championed by Georg Brandes, Henrik Pontoppidan (awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature) and J.P. Jacobsen. Romanticism influenced the renowned writer and poet Hans Christian Andersen, known for his stories and fairy tales, e.g. The Ugly Duckling, The Little Mermaid <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Snow</b> Queen. In recent history Johannes Vilhelm Jensen was also awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Karen Blixen is famous for her novels and short stories.

25|$|According to Alan Robock, who {{has also}} {{published}} nuclear winter papers, the Toba eruption did not precipitate the last glacial period. However assuming an emission of six billion tons of sulphur dioxide, his computer simulations concluded that a maximum global cooling of approximately 15°C occurred for {{three years after the}} eruption, and that this cooling would last for decades, devastating life. Because the saturated adiabatic lapse rate is 4.9°C/1,000 m for temperatures above freezing, the tree line <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> line were around 3,000 m (9,900ft) lower at this time. The climate recovered over a few decades, and Robock found no evidence that the 1,000-year cold period seen in Greenland ice core records had resulted from the Toba eruption. In contrast, Oppenheimer believes that estimates of a drop in surface temperature by 3–5°C are probably too high, and he suggests that temperatures dropped only by 1°C. Robock has criticized Oppenheimer's analysis, arguing that it is based on simplistic T-forcing relationships.|$|E
25|$|The first American {{known to}} see the San Joaquin River was likely Jedediah Smith, a renowned {{mountain}} man, fur trapper and explorer. In 1826, Smith arrived in Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, California, when the region was under control of the Mexican government. As this was in violation of a law which prevented foreigners from entering California, {{and he could have}} been arrested for spying, he traveled north into the San Joaquin Valley, searching for populations of beaver. Smith noted the fertility and natural beauty of the area, and the apparent peace of the Native Americans living in the villages he passed. His expedition then turned east in an attempt to cross the Sierra Nevada. They tried to summit the range by way of both the Kings River and the American River (a tributary of the Sacramento), but it was early spring <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> was too deep. Finally, they crossed the mountains along the Stanislaus River canyon, becoming the first recorded whites to cross the Sierra Nevada on foot. It is still disputed over whether Smith's party discovered gold on the San Joaquin or one of its tributaries. Although some of his men confirmed it, Smith did not make any mention of the precious metal in his journal.|$|E

500|$|The next attempt {{started in}} 2008, when Lasseter {{was able to}} {{convince}} Chris Buck (who co-directed the 1999 film Tarzan for the studio) to return to Walt Disney Feature Animation from Sony Pictures Animation (where he had recently co-directed the Oscar-nominated 2007 film Surf's Up); that September, Buck pitched several ideas to Lasseter, {{one of which was}} The Snow Queen. Buck later revealed that his initial inspiration for The Snow Queen was not the Andersen fairy tale itself, but that he wanted [...] "to do something different on the definition of true love." [...] "Disney had already done the 'kissed by a prince' thing, so [...] thought it was time for something new," [...] he recalled. It turned out Lasseter had been interested in The Snow Queen for a long time; back when Pixar was working with Disney on Toy Story in the 1990s, he saw and was [...] "blown away" [...] by some of the pre-production art from Disney's prior attempts. Development began under the title Anna <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Snow</b> Queen, which was planned to be traditionally animated. According to Josh Gad, he first became involved with the film at that early stage, when the plot was still relatively close to the original Andersen fairy tale and Megan Mullally was going to play Elsa.
