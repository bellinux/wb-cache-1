5|$|Following {{purchase}} in 2008, renovations {{began to}} convert the building into a contemporary arts center. Architects designed gallery spaces, a bookstore and cafe, a 100-seat room, library <b>and</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Geothermal heating supplied by an aquifer underneath the building {{will contribute to the}} goal of LEED Platinum status.|$|E
5|$|Green Wing {{had some}} plot lines {{that were never}} used. Unused storylines {{included}} Alan having an 80-year-old wife and step-grandchildren as old as him, and Guy suffering from impotence. Pile originally wanted the show to cover the entire hospital, not just doctors, but also porters, car park attendants <b>and</b> <b>kitchen</b> staff. However, she eventually decided that they had enough material with the eight main doctors and human resources workers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s Malvern Water was bottled by John and William Burrow at the Bottling Works Spring in Robson Ward's yard on Belle Vue Terrace in Great Malvern.

There are both toilet and shower facilities within the building. The building is centrally heated and includes AV equipment and Wi-Fi. The building is centrally heated with a large main hall <b>and</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{grounds of}} the palace in the 13th century {{included}} a medieval deer park. The right to form the park was granted by King John to Bishop Jocelin in 1207. The Palace Camery was planted with orchards, a herbarium <b>and</b> <b>kitchen</b> gardens to provide food for the Bishop and staff.|$|E
5|$|A new {{visitors}} center {{was added to}} the park in the 1990s, and houses a conference and wedding space, a giftshop, <b>and</b> <b>kitchen.</b> The gift shop contains Items concerning the park and the state of Kentucky, especially books by Kentucky authors and Kentucky Derby items. The park also features the Kenny Rapier Golf Course, a regulation 18-hole golf course named for a previous Kentucky Commissioner of Parks and Bardstown native, that also features a fully equipped pro shop.

5|$|After this débâcle {{the rest}} of Richardson's stage career was at the National, with one late exception. He played Lord Touchwood in The Double Dealer (1978), the Master in The Fruits of Enlightenment (1979), Old Ekdal in The Wild Duck (1979) <b>and</b> <b>Kitchen</b> in Storey's Early Days, {{specially}} written for him. The last toured in North America after the London run. His final West End play was The Understanding (1982), a gentle comedy of late-flowering love. Celia Johnson was cast as his co-star, but died suddenly just before the first night. Joan Greenwood stepped into the breach, but {{the momentum of the}} production had gone, and it closed after eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|As {{the school}} roll grew, the old {{buildings}} became too small. A major building programme {{began in the}} 1950s: £128,000 was set aside to rehouse the school in purpose-built facilities adjacent to the existing school-houses. The first phase was opened in 1956 and included art and handicraft rooms; the second phase was completed in 1958 when physics and chemistry rooms were added; and the third came in 1965 {{with the opening of}} new biology and general science laboratories alongside other classrooms, while the following year saw a new hall/canteen <b>and</b> <b>kitchen</b> open. The final phase consisted of eight further rooms, built shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Intercultural Center, a {{multicultural}} student space, moved into Lathrop {{in spite of}} initial disagreement {{by members of the}} house two years earlier when the idea was first proposed. The Intercultural Center later moved out of Lathrop's basement and into its own dedicated space in the early 1990s, at which point it was replaced by a Jewish co-op <b>and</b> <b>kitchen.</b> In 1995, the Kosher Co-Op moved out of Lathrop and into a newly acquired Jewish house {{across the street from the}} college.|$|E

5|$|In {{its native}} range, the {{sycamore}} {{is associated with}} a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi, but these are not always present in areas to which it has been introduced. It is sometimes planted in urban areas for its value as an amenity tree and produces a hard-wearing, creamy-white close-grained timber that is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring <b>and</b> <b>kitchen</b> utensils. It also makes good firewood. The rising sap in spring has been used to extract sugar and make alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, and honey is made by bees collecting the nectar.|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} center, {{opening in}} 2016 {{in the same}} space, was designed by architectural firm Peter F. Gaito & Associates. It holds a meeting room <b>and</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{on the first floor}} and an oculus opening on the full-length second floor, which is intended for presentations, exhibits, reading, studying, and computer usage. The community center also has a backup generator for use as an emergency broadcast and a warming and cooling center. It can hold 80 people on its first floor and 110 on its second, and has movable furniture and a large television on each floor to accommodate a variety of programming.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} and isolation of radium in uranium ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked {{the development of}} uranium mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery glazes, uranium tile glazes accounted {{for the bulk of}} the use, including common bathroom <b>and</b> <b>kitchen</b> tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, mauve, black, blue, red and other colors.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} centred on the 14th- and 15th-century thickly-walled double-height {{rectangular}} building formerly comprising {{from north to}} south the withdrawing room, great hall, screens passage <b>and</b> <b>kitchens,</b> which are now represented in the same orientation by the ante-room, staircase hall, marble hall <b>and</b> Victorian <b>kitchen.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{ground floor}} contains, {{in the west}} section, the former dining room <b>and</b> <b>kitchen.</b> The {{openings}} in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope, uncovering an original doorway with a four-centred pointed arch. Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room, which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted. The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance {{on the north side}} of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard, and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} laid out around a large central hall {{connecting}} the mansion's two gabled end-pieces, which was used for dining. The other major rooms {{on the ground floor}} are the withdrawing room {{to the right of the}} hall, and the buttery <b>and</b> <b>kitchen</b> to the left; there is also a small entrance porch at the main Hospital Street entrance. The first floor has five main rooms: the upper hall (never open to the roof) and four solars (private upper rooms, some of which would have contained beds), as well as a small chapel. The attic is divided into five rooms and provided servants' accommodation.|$|E
5|$|The true {{number of}} cases of carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning is unknown, since many non-lethal exposures go undetected. From the available data, carbon monoxide poisoning is {{the most common cause of}} injury and death due to poisoning worldwide. Poisoning is typically more common during the winter months. This is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces, gas or kerosene space heaters, <b>and</b> <b>kitchen</b> stoves during the winter months, which if faulty and/or used without adequate ventilation, may produce excessive carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide detection and poisoning also increases during power outages, when electric heating and cooking appliances become inoperative and residents may temporarily resort to fuel-burning space heaters, stoves, and grills (some of which are safe only for outdoor use but nonetheless are errantly burned indoors).|$|E

5|$|Within {{two days}} of the cyclone striking, the Sri Lankan Red Cross began an {{operation}} with 4,000volunteers to help those most badly affected. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies issued a preliminary appeal for $323,000 2000USD ($ USD, $ in 2000CHF) to assist about 10,000people by making blankets, shelter, food, <b>and</b> <b>kitchen</b> utensils available. To kick-start the operation, the Federation released about $61,000 (2000USD ($ USD, $ in 2000CHF)) {{within a few hours}} of the cyclone making landfall. After about a month, the Red Cross distributed 10 roofing sheets each to 1,720 families, and also sent a set of cooking utensils, bed sheets, and sleeping mats to 3,000families. Relief ended on November 7, 2001, roughly 40weeks after the cyclone struck.|$|E
5|$|Built of {{red brick}} with Chilmark and Portland stone dressings, {{the house has}} a compact, {{rectangular}} plan and has two main floors, plus a basement and an attic floor lit by dormer windows. On the south façade, there are eight casement windows {{in the basement and}} nine sash windows on each of the ground floor and first floor. The bay with the three central windows projects forwards slightly, and the central ground floor window is pedimented. The lead-covered hipped roof has a central flat section, surrounded by a balustrade with a cupola rising from its centre. The dormer windows are in a central, balustraded terrace of three, with an outlying window on either side. The house is entered from the north through a later mid-19th-century porte-cochère, while to the south there is a stone-flagged terrace with balustrade extending the full width of the building, and broad shallow steps leading down to the lawns. The east façade has a triple-arched loggia with access to the garden, while to the west there is access to the later 18th-century laundry <b>and</b> <b>kitchen</b> garden.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{black is}} used as the black pigment in {{printing}} ink, artist's oil paint and water colours, carbon paper, automotive finishes, India ink and laser printer toner. Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal {{is used as}} an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, <b>and</b> <b>kitchen</b> extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make {{up most of the}} materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass, stone and metal.|$|E
