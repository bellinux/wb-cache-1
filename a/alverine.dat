50|$|<b>Alverine</b> {{is a drug}} {{used for}} {{functional}} gastrointestinal disorders. <b>Alverine</b> is a smooth muscle relaxant. Smooth muscle {{is a type of}} muscle that is not under voluntary control; it is the muscle present in places such as the gut and uterus. <b>Alverine</b> acts directly on the muscle in the gut, causing it to relax. This prevents the muscle spasms which occur in the gut in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. Diverticular disease is a condition in which small pouches form in the gut lining. These pouches can trap particles of food and become inflamed and painful. In irritable bowel syndrome, the normal activity of the gut muscle is lost. The muscle spasms result in symptoms such as heartburn, abdominal pain and bloating, constipation or diarrhoea. By relaxing the gut muscle, <b>alverine</b> citrate relieves the symptoms of this condition. <b>Alverine</b> also relaxes the smooth muscle in the womb (uterus). It is therefore also used to treat painful menstruation, which is caused by muscle spasms in the uterus (dysmenorrhea).|$|E

40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} LC-MS-MS method for {{the determination of}} <b>alverine</b> (ALV) and its major metabolite, monohydroxy <b>alverine</b> (MHA), in human plasma using imipramine as an internal standard was developed and validated. The analytes were extracted from 0. 5 mL aliquots of human plasma by solid phase extraction, using oasis cartridge. Chromatographic separation was carried on Thermo Gold C 18 column (50 × 4. 6 mm, 5 μ) at 30 °C, with isocratic mobile phase, a flow rate of 0. 4 mL/min and a total run time of 3. 5 min. Detection and quantification were performed using a mass spectrometer in the selected reaction-monitoring mode with positive electrospray ionization at m/z 282. 3 → 91. 11 for <b>alverine,</b> m/z 298. 3 → 106. 9 for mono-hydroxy-alverine, and m/z 281. 0 → 86. 0 for internal standard (IS) respectively. This assay was linear over a concentration range of 0. 060 - 10 ng/mL with a lower limit of quantification of 0. 060 ng/mL for both <b>alverine</b> and monohydroxy <b>alverine.</b> The coefficient of variation for the assay precision were 104. 66 % and > 100. 38 % for <b>alverine</b> and monohydroxy <b>alverine</b> respectively. This method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study after oral administration of <b>alverine</b> citrate 60 mg capsule in healthy male subjects...|$|E
40|$|Drug-induced {{hepatotoxicity}} is {{an important}} cause of hepato-cellular injury. Hepatic necrosis may range from asymptomatic elevations in transaminases to fulminant hepatic failure and death. <b>Alverine</b> is an antispasmodic drug which is especially used in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Only a few cases of <b>alverine</b> associated hepatotoxicity have been reported previously. We present {{the case of a}} patient with <b>alverine</b> induced hepatotoxicity and cholestasis, which has only seldom-ly been reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Sterculia {{with and}} without a smooth-muscle relaxant (<b>alverine</b> citrate) had similar {{beneficial}} effects on constipation and reduced the transit times in diverticular disease. Intracolonic pressure, however, varied with the preparation used. Though both preparations relieved the symptoms of diverticular disease, the one containing <b>alverine</b> citrate was more effective. Part of the mode of action of bran may be to relax the smooth muscle of the gut, since its actions were more {{comparable to those of}} sterculia plus <b>alverine</b> citrate than to those of sterculia alone...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Alverine</b> citrate {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of irritable bowel syndrome for many years. Aims: To compare the efficacy and safety of a new formulation of <b>alverine</b> citrate, a 120 -mg capsule, with placebo given three times daily for 12 weeks. Methods: One hundred and seven patients with irritable bowel syndrome were entered into this three-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. The primary end-point was relief of abdominal pain indicated by improvement in the scores for severity and frequency. Secondary efficacy variables included scores for other clinical symptoms and for overall well-being. Results: The severity and frequency of abdominal pain improved in 66 % and 68 % of patients treated with <b>alverine</b> citrate vs. 58 % and 69 % of the placebo group, but these differences were not significant. The mean percentage reduction in the scores for abdominal pain from baseline to the final assessment, although greater in the <b>alverine</b> citrate group (43. 7 %) compared with the placebo group (33. 3 %), was not statistically significant. Conclusions: <b>Alverine</b> citrate is no better than placebo at relieving the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Future trials should be designed {{to take into account the}} high and persistent placebo response seen in this condition...|$|E
40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} and selective high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method {{was developed and}} validated for the quantification of <b>alverine</b> (ALV) and its active metabolite, para hydroxy <b>alverine</b> (PHA), in human plasma. For sample preparation, solid phase extraction of analytes was performed on Phenomenex Strata-X cartridges using alverine-d 5 as the internal standard. The analytes were separated on Symmetry Shield RP 18 (150  mm× 3. 9  mm, 5  µm) column with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 10  mM ammonium formate (65 : 35, v/v). Detection and quantitation was done by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in the positive mode using multiple reaction monitoring. The assay method was fully validated over the concentration range of 15. 0 – 15, 000  pg/mL for ALV and 30. 0 – 15, 000  pg/mL for PHA. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision (% CV) ranged from 94. 00 % to 96. 00 % and 0. 48 % to 4. 15 % for both the analytes. The mean recovery obtained for ALV and PHA was 80. 59 % and 81. 26 %, respectively. Matrix effect, expressed as IS-normalized matrix factor ranged from 0. 982 to 1. 009 for both the analytes. The application of the method was demonstrated for the specific analysis of ALV and PHA for a bioequivalence study in 52 healthy subjects using 120  mg ALV capsules. The assay reproducibility was also verified by reanalysis of 175 incurred subject samples...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the efficacy of}} a genome-wide protocol in yeast that allows the identification of those gene products that functionally interact with small molecules and result in the inhibition of cellular proliferation. Here we present results from screening 10 diverse compounds in 80 genome-wide experiments against the complete collection of heterozygous yeast deletion strains. These compounds include anticancer and antifungal agents, statins, <b>alverine</b> citrate, and dyclonine. In several cases, we identified previously known interactions; furthermore, in each case, our analysis revealed novel cellular interactions, even when {{the relationship between a}} compound and its cellular target had been well established. In addition, we identified a chemical core structure shared among three therapeutically distinct compounds that inhibit the ERG 24 heterozygous deletion strain, demonstrating that cells may respond similarly to compounds of related structure. The ability to identify on-and-off target effects in vivo is fundamental to understanding the cellular response to small-molecule perturbants...|$|E

AimsTo determine the clinical effectiveness of the antispasmodic agents available in Mexico {{for the treatment of}} IBS. MethodsWe carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials on antispasmodic agents for IBS treatment. Clinical trials identified from January 1960 to May 2011 were searched for in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and in the ClinicalTrials. gov registry. Treatment response was evaluated by global improvement of symptoms or abdominal pain, abdominal distention/bloating, and frequency of adverse events. The effect of antispasmodics vs placebo was expressed in OR and 95 % CI. ResultsTwenty-seven studies were identified, 23 of which fulfilled inclusion criteria. The studied agents were pinaverium bromide, mebeverine, otilonium, trimebutine, <b>alverine,</b> hyoscine, alverine/simethicone, pinaverium/simethicone, fenoverine, and dicyclomine. A total of 2585 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Global improvement was 1. 55 (CI 95 %: 1. 33 to 1. 83). Otilonium and the alverine/simethicone combination produced significant values in global improvement while the pinaverium/simethicone combination showed improvement in bloating. As for pain, 2394 patients were included with an OR of 1. 52 (IC 95 %: 1. 28 a 1. 80), favoring antispasmodics.

40|$|Long chain {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acid}} (LC-PUFA) biosynthesis is an important metabolic pathway in vertebrates, especially fish, considering they are {{the major source of}} n- 3 LC-PUFA in the human diet. However, most fish have only limited capability for biosynthesis of LC-PUFA. The rabbitfish (Siganus canaliculatus) is able to synthesize LC-PUFA as it has all the key enzyme activities required including Δ 6 Δ 5 Fads 2, Δ 4 Fads 2, Elovl 5 and Elovl 4. We previously reported a direct interaction between the transcription factor Hnf 4 α and the promoter regions of Δ 4 and Δ 6 Δ 5 Fads 2, which suggested that Hnf 4 α was involved in the transcriptional regulation of fads 2 in rabbitfish. For further functionally investigating it, a full-length cDNA of 1736 bp encoding rabbitfish Hnf 4 α with 454 amino acids was cloned, which was highly expressed in intestine, followed by liver and eyes. Similar to the expression characteristics of its target genes Δ 4 and Δ 6 Δ 5 fads 2, levels of hnf 4 α mRNA in liver and eyes were higher in fish reared at low salinity than those reared in high salinity. After the rabbitfish primary hepatocytes were respectively incubated with <b>Alverine,</b> Benfluorex or BI 6015, which were anticipated agonists or antagonist for Hnf 4 α, the mRNA level of Δ 6 Δ 5 and Δ 4 fads 2 displayed a similar change tendency with that of hnf 4 α mRNA. Furthermore, when the mRNA level of hhf 4 α was knocked down using siRNA, the expression of Δ 6 Δ 5 and Δ 4 fads 2 also decreased. Together, these data suggest that Hnf 4 α is involved in the transcriptional regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis, specifically, by targeting Δ 4 and Δ 6 Δ 5 fads 2 in rabbitfish...|$|E
40|$|O presente trabalho foi centrado na arilacao de Heck-Matuda de diferentes olefinas com sais de arenodiazonio e a aplicacao dos produtos arilados na sintese de compostos bioativos. O trabalho esta dividido em dois capitulos: 1) Reacoes de acoplamento de Heck-Matsuda entre aminas alilicas e sais de arenodiazonio e suas aplicacoes nas sinteses de compostos bioativos. 2) Estudos da reacao de Heck-Matsuda em liquidos ionicos e suas aplicacoes na sintese de derivados C-azanucleosideos, potenciais compostos antituberculose. Com relacao a primeira parte do trabalho, foi desenvolvida uma metodologia abrangente para a reacao de Heck-Matsuda entre alilaminas e sais de arenodiazonio. Foram empregados diversos derivados de aminas alilicas e diferentes sais de arenodiazonio contendo grupamentos doadores, retiradores de eletrons e grupos volumosos. Para todos os casos foram obtidos rendimentos de bons a excelentes, em alta regio- e estereosseletividades em favor do produto ×- arilado de configuracao trans. Adicionalmente, a aplicacao deste protocolo forneceu os compostos bioativos naftifina, abamina, abamina SG, alverina e cloridrato de cinacalcet, tendo como etapa-chave a reacao de Heck altamente seletiva. A segunda parte do trabalho envolveu as reacoes de Heck-Matsuda entre a ftalimida alilica e sais de diazonio liquidos ionicos. Nestas reacoes, foram obtidos rendimentos e seletividades semelhantes aos observados com o solvente convencional benzonitrila. Alem disso, foram estudadas reacoes com geracao in situ de sal de hexafluorfosfato de arenodiazonio em [bmim] [PF 6], seguida pela reacao de Heck-Matsuda em procedimento ¡§one pot¡¨. Por fim, foram {{realizadas}} as sinteses de dois derivados de C-azanucleosideos, tendo como etapa-chave a reacao de Heck-Matsuda entre um enecarbamato endociclico e sal de arenodiazonio. Estes compostos terão suas atividades antituberculose avaliadas pelo grupo de pesquisa do professor Mourey em Toulouse, na França. The present {{work was}} focused in the Heck-Matsuda arylation of several olefins with arenediazonium salts {{and in the}} application of the arylated products as intermediates in the syntheses of bioactive compounds. The work is divided in two chapters: 1) Heck-Matsuda reactions between allyl amines and arenediazonium salts and their applications in the synthesis of bioactive compounds, 2) Studies of the Heck-Matsuda reaction in ionic liquids and its application to the synthesis of Cazanucleosides, which are potential antituberculosis compounds. Regarding {{the first part of this}} work, a comprehensive methodology for the Heck-Matsuda reaction between allylamines and arenediazonium salts was developed. Several allyl amines derivatives and differents arenediazonium salts were sucessfully employed. Both electron donating and withdrawing groups, as well as bulky substituents, were well tolerated in the diazonium salt. In all cases good to excellent yields and high regio- and stereoselectivities in favor of the ×-trans arylated products were obtained. Additionally, some of the adducts prepared by this highly selective Heck reaction were employed as intermediates in the total synthesis of the bioactive compounds naftifine, abamine, abamine SG, <b>alverine</b> and cinacalcet hydrochloride. The second part of this work adressed the Heck-Matsuda reaction between allylic phthalimide and arenediazonium salts in ionic liquids. Under the investigated conditions, the yields and selectivities were similar to those previous achieved with the conventional solvent benzonitrile. In addition, we evaluated the in situ generation of the 4 -fluorbenzenediazonium hexafluorophosphate salt in [bmim][PF 6], followed by the Heck-Matsuda reaction in a one pot procedure. Finally, we carried out the synthesis of two C-azanucleosides using the Heck-Matsuda reaction with an endocyclic enecarbamate as the key step. As a further development of this work, these compounds will be evaluated regarding their potential antituberculosis activity by Professor Mourey's research group in Toulouse, France...|$|E
