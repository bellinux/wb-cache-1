5|$|After Hunyadi {{defeated}} the Ottomans in Transylvania in March 1442, the Ottoman governor of Bulgaria accused Vlad of treachery, {{according to the}} contemporaneous Ottoman historian, Neşri. Murad summoned Vlad to Edirne to demonstrate his loyalty. Before departing, Vlad made his eldest son, Mircea, the ruler of Wallachia. Soon <b>after</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to Edirne, he was captured at the sultan's command. He was held in captivity in Gallipoli.|$|E
5|$|Totti {{was born}} in Rome to parents Lorenzo and Fiorella Totti. He {{was raised in the}} Porta Metronia neighbourhood. As a youngster he idolised ex-Roma captain Giuseppe Giannini, and {{regularly}} played football with older boys. Totti began to play youth team football at the age of 8, with Fortitudo, later joining Smit Trastevere and Lodigiani. <b>After</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to the attention of scouts, his mother refused a lucrative offer from Milan in order to keep him in his home town. Although his youth club initially had come to an agreement to sell Totti to the Lazio youth side, one of Roma's youth coaches, Gildo Giannini, persuaded his parents to let him join the Roma youth squad in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Known by the Romans as Cofna, Jifna was a {{regional}} {{capital in the}} Iudaea Province under the Roman Empire. Around 50 BCE the Roman general Cassius sold the population into slavery, for failure to pay taxes. They were freed, however, by Mark Antony shortly <b>after</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to power. Jifna was within the area under Hananiah's command in 66 CE, during the First Jewish-Roman War, and was the headquarters {{of one of the}} twelve toparchies (minor realms) of Judea. The Roman emperor Vespasian occupied the town in 68 CE, established an army garrison there, and concentrated within the city Jewish priests and other local notables who had surrendered to him. Titus, the future Roman emperor, passed through Gophna during his march to besiege Jerusalem in 70 CE. Gophna had a sizable priestly Israelite population on the wake of the Bar Kokhba Revolt in the 130s, and it is possible that an entire synagogue congregation of Gophna (including priests) relocated to Tzippori in Galilee by the 3rd century CE.|$|E

5|$|Mills {{was given}} time {{to rebuild the}} squad over the summer of 2008, {{bringing}} in players like Bradley Pritchard, Alex Rodman, Chris Smith, Tom Shaw and Michael Wylde. He was named the Conference North Manager of the Month for September 2008, in which Tamworth achieved three straight league wins following a draw away to in-form Alfreton. He won the award again for March 2009 after Tamworth were top of the table with five wins and two draws, including a 1–0 victory away to title rivals Southport. Mills led Tamworth to promotion back to the Conference Premier after winning the Conference North title in 2008–09 and this was confirmed with a 1–0 victory over local rivals Hinckley United on 21 April 2009. The final match of the season, a 0–0 draw away to A.F.C. Telford United, saw Mills come out of retirement <b>after</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> on as a 90th-minute substitute for Rodman. He was given a standing ovation from the travelling supporters in the process. After {{the end of the}} season he was named the Conference North Manager of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Accrington Stanley {{accepted}} an undisclosed bid from Wrexham in July 2005, {{which included a}} sell-on clause and a bonus if he returned to play international football. He scored on his debut in a friendly against UEFA Champions League winners Liverpool in the 4–3 defeat <b>after</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> on as a substitute. McEvilly suffered a stress fracture in a metatarsus bone on his right foot in the 1–1 home draw with Notts County on 11 December, although he declared himself fit to play their following game against Carlisle United, he was substituted after 45 minutes after receiving a mouth injury which had required temporary dental surgery the same evening. His foot injury was later operated on and he received further dental treatment. His return to the Wrexham team following his injury was on 9 April 2006, in their 2–1 home defeat to Shrewsbury Town when he came on as a substitute replacing Matt Crowell in the 45th minute. He made a further three appearances scoring one goal, before breaking the same bone again in mid-April sidelining him {{until the end of}} the season. During the 2005–06 season, McEvilly made a total of 23 appearances for Wrexham, scoring seven goals in League Two.|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} Johnston {{was at the}} peak of his career in terms of bowling average and wickets taken per match. In his 24 Tests to the end of the series, he had taken 111 wickets at 19.22, with Australia winning 19 and losing two. In the Fourth Test in Melbourne, Johnston took match figures of 5/110, {{removing}} Weekes in both innings, before coming to the crease in the second innings to partner Doug Ring. Australia were 9/222 in pursuit of 260 for victory, with the series finely poised 2–1. The crowd of 30,000 and the constabulary were resigned to an Australian defeat, with the police officers moving into position to stop the customary pitch invasion at the end of the match. However, the Richmond teammates had other ideas and put together a last wicket partnership of 38, which sealed an Australian victory by one wicket. Ring thought that playing for a draw was impractical, so he decided to attack, while Johnston attempted to hold up his end with a series of defensive shots. The West Indian captain John Goddard placed his fielders halfway to the boundary, allowing Johnston to easily take singles, while Ring was able to clear the infield easily. The Richmond pair thought that Goddard's captaincy was poor. Johnston eventually brought up the winning run by turning Frank Worrell for a single behind square leg, 35 minutes <b>after</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to the crease.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{made another}} famous {{century in the}} return Sheffield Shield match against arch-rivals New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Miller had a lean time with the bat in the first innings, being {{dismissed}} for six as Hassett's tourists made 356. He was then punished as the New South Welshmen amassed 79 runs from his 14 overs, taking only the wicket of Ginty Lush as the hosts replied with 329. Miller came to the crease at 2/118 after 100 minutes on the third morning, with brothers Merv and Neil Harvey back in the pavilion. Miller combined with Ian Johnson (82) in a 126-run partnership, before sharing an unbroken 206-run stand with Meuleman. By stumps, 232 minutes <b>after</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to the crease, Miller had reached 206 not out, and Victoria declared at 3/450. Miller struck 15 fours and three sixes in a strident attack on the bowling. His first six was struck from the leg spin of Fred Johnston and landed {{on the roof of}} the Members Stand. The second, from the occasional left arm unorthodox spin of Test teammate Arthur Morris, was a lofted drive that went straight back over the bowler's head and over the sightscreen at the Paddington End; the ball was still rising when it hit the upper deck of the MA Noble Stand around 100m away. His third six sent a delivery from Test bowling colleague Toshack over the square leg fence.|$|E
5|$|Milan scored {{within the}} first minute of the match after captain Paolo Maldini volleyed in an Andrea Pirlo free kick that had been conceded by Djimi Traoré. The goal made Maldini the oldest scorer {{in the history of}} the competition. Liverpool responded almost immediately; John Arne Riise, who was picked out by a corner kick from Steven Gerrard, hit a volley from the edge of the penalty box. His shot was cleared only for Gerrard to cross in from the right wing, which Sami Hyypiä headed towards goal {{producing}} a save out of Dida. Milan almost extended their lead in the 13th minute, after Crespo's header was cleared off the goal line by Luis García. A few minutes later, Liverpool made a substitution after Harry Kewell picked up a groin injury; he was replaced by Vladimír Šmicer. Soon after, Kaká passed through to Andriy Shevchenko who put his shot past Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, but Shevchenko was adjudged to have been in an offside position and the goal did not stand. Shevchenko had another chance to score a few minutes later; after being played onside by Traore, his shot was saved by Dudek <b>after</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> under pressure from the Liverpool defence. Luis García had two chances to score following Shevchenko's shot; the first shot from the edge of the penalty area went well over the crossbar and after he was headed through by Baroš his next shot went wide. Straight after this attack, Crespo went through on goal only to be flagged for offside. Almost immediately after this, Liverpool had a penalty claim turned down after Alessandro Nesta allegedly handballed. Milan countered and scored; Kaka dribbled the ball into the Liverpool half and passed to Shevchenko, who passed to Crespo at the far post to score and make it 2–0. Minutes later, Crespo extended Milan's lead with a chip over Dudek after Kaka provided the assist to make it 3–0.|$|E
