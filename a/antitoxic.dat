Precautionary consumption is not only of questionable utility, but is fundamentally misguided as an approach for inspiring <b>antitoxics</b> organizing. The failure of this approach is in part due to its assumption of a naturally bounded, autonomous individual who is able to maintain an impermeable boundary between herself and the environment.

40|$|Acrylamide is a toxic {{compound}} formed during thermical processing of foods that contain amino acids, mainly asparagine, and reducing sugars.

40|$|Abstract Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{are emerging}} pollutants widely distributed in aquatic environ-ment. Although the bioaccumulation of this compound {{has been well}} studied, few studies have investigated their im-pacts on <b>antitoxic</b> systems of invertebrates, considering both genders. Here, we have evaluated the effects of BDE- 47 and BDE- 99 congeners on the <b>antitoxic</b> defence systems of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex, and espe-cially on the multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity, {{as well as the}} activities of two <b>antitoxic</b> enzymes, the glu-tathione-S-transferase (GST) and the glutathione per-oxidases (GPx). Results revealed that BDE- 47 and BDE- 99 have inhibited the MXR activity whatever the gammarid gender, which could lead to a reduction of the pollutant elimination from the organism. In addition, a gender-biased response and a congener-biased effect on the <b>antitoxic</b> enzymes activities were observed. Indeed, both BDE con-gener exposures increased the GST activity in males, whereas in females, only BDE- 99 congener modified this activity by decreasing it. On the contrary, BDE exposures did not impact the GPx activity in females, while in males BDE- 99 has increased it. Results of the present study highlight that a PBDE exposure at 0. 1 lg L- 1 modify an-titoxic enzymes activities differently according to gender, which could lead to a change in G. pulex sensitivity on the long term.

The present study investigates {{the effect of this}} co-infection on the <b>antitoxic</b> defence responses of naturally infected females exposed to cadmium stress. Our results revealed that, depending on the cadmium dose, bi-infection induced only slight, significant increased cell damage in G. roeseli as compared to non-infection. In addition, the <b>antitoxic</b> defence pattern of cadmium-exposed bi-infected hosts was similar to the pattern of cadmium-exposed D. roeselum-infected hosts. Reduced glutathione concentrations, carotenoid levels and c-glutamylcystein ligase activity decreased, while metallothionein concentrations increased. This similar pattern indicates that host physiology can be controlled to some extent by microsporidia under stress conditions. It supports the hypothesis of a disruption of acanthocephalan effects in the presence of microsporidia.

40|$|The {{potential}} anticlastogenic and <b>antitoxic</b> {{effects of}} a soil humic acid (HA), a peat HA and a peat fulvic acid (FA) on the mutagen maleic hydrazide (MH) have been investigated in two legume species, Vicia faba and Pisum sativum. Both HAs and FA were tested at two different concentrations, 20 and 200 mgl- 1, either alone or after 24 -hour interaction with 10 mgl- 1 of MH before addition to the legume seeds. Anticlastogenicity, i. e. an antimutagenic action defined as the capacity for minimizing chromosome breakages, was evaluated by counting both micronuclei (MN) and aberrant anatelophases (AAT) in root-tip cells. Length and dry weight of the seedling primary root were measured to test the <b>antitoxic</b> activity of HA and FA on MH. The possible occurrence and extent of adsorption or desorption of MH onto or fromH A were also investigated. The two species responded differently to the anticlastogenic tests, with V. faba showing {{a greater number of}} MN and AAT anomalies than P. sativum. Peat HA and FA exhibited anticlastogenic and <b>antitoxic</b> activities of similar intensity and greater than those of soil HA.

40|$|The acanthocephalan {{parasite}} Polymorphus minutus is a manipulator of its {{intermediate host}} Gammarus roeseli, which favours its transmission {{to the final}} host, a water bird. In contaminated environments, G. roeseli {{have to cope with}} two stresses, i. e. P. minutus infection and pollutants. As P. minutus survival relies on its host’s survival, we investigated the influence of P. minutus on the <b>antitoxic</b> defence capacities and the energy reserves of G. roeseli females after cadmium exposure. In parallel, malondialdehyde, a toxic effect biomarker, was measured in G. roeseli females and in P. minutus. The results revealed that infected females displayed higher cell damage than uninfected ones, despite an apparent increase in reduced glutathione and metallothionein production. In fact, the increase of these <b>antitoxic</b> systems could be counterbalanced by carotenoid intake by the parasite, so that the overall defence system seemed less efficient in infected females than in uninfected ones. In addition, we demonstrated that cadmium induced cell damage in P. minutus, probably linked with cadmium accumulation in the parasite. Altogether, we observed a paradoxical pattern of responses suggesting that P. minutus increases cadmium toxicity in G. roeseli females although (i) it tends to increase several host <b>antitoxic</b> defence capacities and (ii) it bears part of the pollutant, as reflected by cell damage in the parasite...|$|E

The <b>antitoxic</b> sera, when given in sufficient quantity, could prevent the lethal effects of infection caused by strains of P. aeru-ginosa whose somatic antigens were unrelated to those of strain PA-I 03, provided the serotype of the exotoxin produced by the organisms was identical. Antitoxin A did not neutralize the cell-bound protein toxins of these organisms. The findings seemed to indicate that neither the cell-bound protein toxin nor the lipopoly-saccharide somatic antigen was an important factor in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa.

Procholeragenoid is a stable high-molecular-weight aggregate of cholera toxin formed during the heating of cholera toxin. Procholeragenoid retained approximately 1 % of the toxicity of native toxin as determined in the rabbit ileal loop and Y- 1 adrenal cell assays and 5 % of the activity in the rabbit skin assay. Immunization of pregnant dams with 50 micrograms of procholeragenoid 5 and 2 weeks before the expected delivery date elicited high titers of <b>antitoxic</b> immunoglobulin G and toxin-neutralizing antibody in both the colostrum and serum. In three independent field trials, immunization with procholeragenoid resulted in a substantial decrease in diarrhea (73 % in controls versus 11 % in immunized) and death (4. 7 % in controls versus 0. 77 % in immunized) in neonatal piglets. The protection rate in the immunized population was approximately 85 % for both diarrhea and death. In the following gestation period, reimmunization of dams with a single dose of procholeragenoid (50 micrograms) 2 weeks before delivery elicited titers of <b>antitoxic</b> immunoglobulin G and toxin-neutralizing antibody comparable to those obtained during the primary immunization.

Markers of inflammatory reactions, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I, and C-reactive protein were found in high concentrations in children with symptomatic P. falciparum malaria compared with levels in children with asymptomatic P. falciparum infections or in healthy children, indicating that inflammatory reactions are induced only in children with clinical symptoms. Concentrations of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I and C-reactive protein were associated with levels of parasitemia. We detected <b>antitoxic</b> activities in sera as measured by their capacity to block toxin-induced Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) activation.

Diphtheria toxoid was given intradermally 24 hours following the intravenous administration of antitoxin {{and the subsequent}} reactions were graded and measured. The intensity of Arthus reactions was dependent upon the relative amounts of precipitating antitoxin and toxoid used. Severe lesions were caused by intravenous sensitization with 0. 48 mg. precipitating antitoxin N and intradermal challenge with 0. 05 or 0. 17 toxoid N. Reactions of lesser intensity were caused by smaller amounts of antitoxin and toxoid. The nature of the antibody used for sensitization was of importance in the severity of Arthus reactions. In contrast to the behavior of precipitating antitoxin, amounts of non-precipitating antitoxin equivalent to 0. 48 mg. N did not cause severe Arthus reactions when 0. 05 or 0. 17 mg. toxoid N was given intradermally. Precipitating <b>antitoxic</b> whole serum is altered by heating at 56 °C. for 5 hours so that its precipitability is lost without any appreciable loss of <b>antitoxic</b> strength.

When fractions of precipitating <b>antitoxic</b> serum were obtained using a cold ethanol technique described by Deutsch (16), a mixture of the purified γ 2 -globulin and the crude albumin fraction heated together at 56 °C. for 5 hours behaved similarly to whole serum.

40|$|The {{immunogenicity}} {{and safety}} of purified cholera toxin (CT), its B subunit, and a crude culture filtrate of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae (CrT) were compared in dogs immunized orally and challenged with virulent V. cholerae. CT and CrT caused marked protection in two- or three-dose regimens. Protection due to CT occurred only with doses that caused transient, sometimes severe, diarrhea in most dogs; this protection was proportional to the peak antitoxin response in jejunal mucosa and lasted at least 15 weeks. In contrast, minimum protective doses of CrT contained much less cholera toxin, caused very mild diarrhea in only 21 % of the dogs, and evoked protection that was greater than predicted from the modest jejunal antitoxin response. B subunit caused smaller jejunal antitoxin responses than did similar doses of CT and was poorly protective, the 50 % protective dose being > 40 -fold {{greater than that of}} CT. Two observations indicated that protection due to CrT involved synergy between antibacterial and <b>antitoxic</b> immune responses. First, the 50 % protective dose of CrT was 24 -fold and > 36 -fold smaller than the 50 % protective doses of its CT and non-CT antigenic components, respectively, when tested separately. Second, protection was greater in CrT-immunized dogs than in CT-immunized dogs for a given mucosal antitoxin response. Low doses of CrT evoked serotype-specific protection, indicating that the serotype-specific O somatic antigen contributed significatly to antibacterial protection. These results suggest that a simple, effective, nonliving oral vaccine for cholera based on combined antibacterial and <b>antitoxic</b> immunity can probably be achieved.

The electrophoretic patterns of precipitating <b>antitoxic</b> sera resembled those found in normal non-immune sera. However, skin-sensitizing <b>antitoxic</b> sera were distinguished by a relatively large beta globulin component and a small or indistinct alpha 2 globulin. Fusion of both components was present in some sera containing this variety of antitoxin. Considerable amounts of serum-bound polysaccharides in these sera migrated relatively slowly {{in contrast to the}} behavior of polysaccharides of precipitating <b>antitoxic</b> sera which migrated faster when tested under similar conditions.

There were no demonstrable differences between the electrophoretic behavior of sera obtained from subjects before or after immunization with toxoid. Electrophoretic patterns of serum from allergic subjects who developed marked eosinophilia showed attenuation of the alphas globulin associated with a relative preponderance of slow migrating protein-bound polysaccharides. These alterations were not present in sera obtained from the same persons before and after the development of eosinophilia. Changes in the proteins and polysaccharides could not be demonstrated with consistency in subjects with mild to moderate hay-fever symptoms. One person who developed severe acute hay-fever symptoms showed alterations in the beta and alpha 2 globulins.
