5|$|Tales of Graces {{consists}} {{primarily of}} two major areas: the field map and a battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment traversed by foot. On the field maps, various skits between the characters can be viewed. They involve animated character portraits, subtitles, and full voice acting. Skits concern anything from character development to side details. The battle screen is a 3D representation of <b>an</b> <b>area,</b> <b>in</b> which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> {{which the}} island {{operates}} as a single market is electricity. For much of their existence electricity networks in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate. Both networks were designed and constructed independently post partition. However, {{as a result of}} changes over recent years they are now connected with three interlinks and also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe. The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) with enough power. In the Republic of Ireland, the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe. EirGrid is building a HVDC transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW, about 10% of Ireland's peak demand.|$|E
5|$|Fishing Creek drains most of Columbia County {{north of}} the Susquehanna River except for <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> {{the eastern part of}} the county, which is drained by Briar Creek. It also drains {{southern}} Sullivan County and western Luzerne County. Minor tributaries drain small portions of Montour County and southeastern Lycoming County. The upper part of the watershed is 85 percent forest and 13 percent farmland. Near its source, the other two percent is residential; closer to Benton, the remainder is urban. The creek's drainage basin consists of a number of sub-watersheds. The largest ones are the Huntington Creek watershed, with an area of 114 square miles; the Little Fishing Creek watershed, with an area of 68.1 square miles; the Green Creek drainage basin, with an area of 36.9 square miles; and the West Branch Fishing Creek drainage basin, with an area of 32.9 square miles.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} A.subrubescens are usually solitary, but {{sometimes}} several (typically {{between two and}} eight) are stuck together by the stem bases or {{on the sides of}} their caps. A strictly terrestrial species, it is not found fruiting on wood. It prefers to grow in pine woods, but has occasionally been associated with silver fir in Europe; fruit bodies associated with the latter tree species tend to be less robust than those found growing with pine. It is suspected that A.subrubescens may be mycorrhizal with two- and three-needle pines (i.e., those species that have their needles attached in bundles of two or three), although its ecological preferences are not known with certainty. Ginns, relating a personal communication with David Arora, wrote that Arora encountered several clumps of fruit bodies in <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> California containing mostly knobcone pine (a three-needle pine), manzanita, huckleberry and a few mandrones.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 7th century, the West Saxons {{occupied}} <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> {{the west of}} southern England, though the exact boundaries are difficult to define. To their west was the native British kingdom of Dumnonia, {{in what is now}} Devon and Cornwall. To the north were the Mercians, whose king, Wulfhere, had dominated southern England during his reign. In 674 he was succeeded by his brother, Æthelred, who was less militarily active than Wulfhere had been along the frontier with Wessex, though the West Saxons did not recover the territorial gains Wulfhere had made. To the southeast was the kingdom of the South Saxons, in what is now Sussex; and to the east were the East Saxons, who controlled London.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} installments in the Tales series, Tales of Symphonia consists {{primarily of}} three major areas: an overworld field map, town and dungeon maps, and a battle screen. The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down {{version of the}} game's fictional world which the player travels through to reach the game's locations. As with preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot, on the party's quadrupedal pet Noishe, and on flying vehicles known as Rheairds. On field maps, characters are directed across realistically scaled environments. The battle screen is a 3D representation of <b>an</b> <b>area,</b> <b>in</b> which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E

The redistricting that followed the 2000 census also gave Moran a portion of Reston, Virginia. His district {{is located in the}} Dulles Technology Corridor and is the home of many federal defense contractors as well as a significant number of those who work in the information technology industry. Many federal employees also reside within the district, mostly due to its proximity to Washington and because the United States Department of Defense and various other agencies are headquartered there.|$|E

5|$|On 9 April, {{after a long}} resistance, Königsberg in East Prussia fell to the Red Army. This {{freed up}} Marshal Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front to move west to the east bank of the Oder river. Marshal Georgy Zhukov {{concentrated}} his 1st Belorussian Front, which had been deployed along the Oder river from Frankfurt {{in the south to}} the Baltic, into <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> front of the Seelow Heights. The 2nd Belorussian Front moved into the positions being vacated by the 1st Belorussian Front north of the Seelow Heights. While this redeployment was in progress, gaps were left in the lines; and the remnants of General Dietrich von Saucken's German II Army, which had been bottled up in a pocket near Danzig, managed to escape into the Vistula Delta. To the south, Marshal Konev shifted the main weight of the 1st Ukrainian Front out of Upper Silesia and north-west to the Neisse River.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{the theory}} that temnospondyls were the {{ancestors}} of all lissamphibians has gained wide support. The skull morphology of some small temnospondyls {{has been compared to}} those of modern frogs and salamanders, but the presence of bicuspid, pedicellate teeth in small, paedomorphic or immature temnospondyls has been cited as the most convincing argument in favor of the temnospondyl origin of lissamphibians. Seen in lissamphibians and many dissorophoid temnospondyls, pedicellate teeth have calcified tips and bases. During the development of most tetrapods, teeth begin to calcify at their tips. Calcification normally proceeds downward {{to the base of the}} tooth, but calcification from the tip stops abruptly in pedicellate teeth. Calcification resumes at the base, leaving <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> the center of the tooth uncalcified. This pattern is seen in living amphibians and fossils.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Xillia {{consists}} {{primarily of}} two major areas: the field map and the battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment where the player character traverses and interacts with non-player characters, items, or mob avatars. On the field map, character interactions between the party can also be viewed {{in the form of}} a sketch story; these sketch stories are referred to as skits and consist of animated portraits and voice acting. When coming into contact with a mob avatar, the environment switches to the battle screen, a 3D representation of <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> which the player commands the characters in battles against the CPU-controlled mobs.|$|E

5|$|The Chew Valley is <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> North Somerset, England, {{named after}} the River Chew, which rises at Chewton Mendip, and joins the River Avon at Keynsham. Technically, {{the area of the}} valley is bounded by the water {{catchment}} area of the Chew and its tributaries; however, the name Chew Valley is often used less formally to cover other nearby areas, for example, Blagdon Lake and its environs, which by a stricter definition are part of the Yeo Valley. The valley is an area of rich arable and dairy farmland, interspersed with a number of villages.|$|E
5|$|The X Corps attack {{involved}} a strike {{on the left}} flank by the 213th Infantry Regiment and 7th Tank Battalion, and on the right flank by the 205th Infantry Regiment and 4th Tank Battalion. The right flanking force arrived late, so the 213th Infantry and the 7th Tank Battalion advanced alone on the north axis. It was thought that the 213th could reach <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> between Chéhéry and Bulson in one hour fifty minutes and the 7th Tank Battalion in two hours.

5|$|The first botanical {{collection}} {{of this species}} {{may well have been}} Claude Riche, naturalist to Bruni d'Entrecasteaux's 1791 expedition in search of the lost ships of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse. During a visit to Esperance Bay, Riche explored <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> which B.speciosa is extremely common. However, he got lost and was forced to abandon his collections. The species was eventually collected by Robert Brown in 1802, and published by him in 1810. Alex George selected an 1802 specimen collected at Lucky Bay to be the lectotype in 1981. An early common name was handsome banksia. Common names include showy banksia and ricrac banksia, from the zigzag shape of its long thin leaves.|$|E
