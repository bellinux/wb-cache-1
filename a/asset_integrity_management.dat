50|$|Asset {{integrity}} {{is the ability}} of an oil and gas asset to perform its required function effectively and efficiently whilst protecting health, safety and the environment. <b>Asset</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>management</b> is the means of ensuring that the people, systems, processes and resources that deliver integrity are in place, in use and will perform when required over the whole lifecycle of the asset. In 2004, the HSE highlighted the infrastructure on which work was required to maintain integrity and £4 billion was subsequently spent in the area of asset maintenance. In 2009, the HSE confirmed that the key issues identified earlier had been resolved. Specific initiatives now encourage industry wide engagement and continued investment in asset integrity. On a global level, Asset Integrity continues to be ranked amongst the oil and gas industry's biggest challenges and main focus areas, In spite of this, recent research by Oil and Gas Fundamentals has indicated that understanding of the subject inside the industry is still not where it needs to be.|$|E

40|$|<b>Asset</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>management</b> {{requires}} {{knowledge of}} current and future structural loading, the current damage in the material, and the ultimate state of the material. To understand all of these topics, TNO is investing in an <b>asset</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>management</b> ‘toolbox. ’ Loading is accounted for with new sensors and techniques to analyze the results. Material damage is assessed with traditional fatigue crack growth analysis or with a much less conservative method, which accounts for {{the order in which}} loading cycles have been applied. Furthermore, TNO is investigating how corrosion and fatigue interact in offshore environments in order to better account for both the initiation and propagation of cracks in steels in offshore structures. Finally, in order to know the end of the fatigue life, it is necessary to know how long a fatigue crack can be before an unstable fracture could occur. Toward that end, TNO has created modelling software the can help to assess fracture mechanics. Notably, that software can use fundamental principles to transfer the results from one fracture mechanics situation to another, thus potentially allowing for one set of tests to represent the many different scenarios that can occur throughout a complex structure. Transferring minimally destructive fracture testing to a situation that is relevant for real structures is just one application for the theory that served as the basis for this software.

40|$|Owing to {{commercial}} opportunities on the Norwegian oil & gas sector, {{there is a}} growing demand for products and services for <b>Asset</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>management</b> (AIM). In general, the market demands greater degree of innovation in AIM. Seeking means to simplify complex work processes {{and at the same time}} to have a better understanding and awareness of inherent risks. The trends for innovative AIM products and services can always be challenged due to such factors as innovation costs, organizational capacity, technological capacity to drive innovation, as well as underlying business growth potential of the innovation. Other challenges or barriers can include financial constraints, regulatory challenges, and conservative clients to invest in revolutionary products. The purpose of this thesis is to map the current status and to elaborate on the future trends for such products and services on the Norwegian shelf (NCS). It includes a comprehensive literature survey on <b>Asset</b> <b>Integrity</b> <b>Management</b> (AIM) within the Global and Norwegian O&G industry. Also, a market survey of available AIM products and services being offered by Norwegian AIM service providers was conducted to review the status quo. In addition, expert opinion from a number of Norwegian AIM service providers was included through questionnaire and informal interviews to validate results emanating from mapping the existing and new AIM products and services within the sector. The work highlights the status and gaps through a thorough analysis of theory and what is currently available in AIM of oil and gas assets. It highlights trends emerging from service providers on the NCS that are demanded by new asset operational scenarios such as Integrated operations. In this context, various technological capabilities take a leading role seeking significant value creation opportunities in terms of safety, cost, and production.

40|$|Purpose - This {{paper is}} {{a note of}} success story of {{implementation}} of <b>Asset</b> <b>Integrity</b> <b>Management</b> System in PT. Chevron Pacific Indonesia Design/Methodology/Approach - PT. Chevron Pacific Indonesia (PT. CPI) is subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, 2 nd world largest Oil & Gas Company. To support its operation, a major number of equipment and facilities have been operating. After more than 30 years of operation, nowadays PT. CPI was entering mature phase of operation. Risk to keep operating the equipment and facility is growing up rapidly. The risk can affect to worker, environment, company’s reputation and profit, etc. Realized that condition, managing the integrity of these aging assets have become a critical attention to lower the risk. Starting in 2007, Chevron Corporate introduces an initiative called <b>Asset</b> <b>Integrity</b> <b>Management</b> System (AIMS) a part of Surface Equipment Reliability & Integrity Program (SERIP). Adopting a well-known “Swiss Cheese” concept, PT. CPI had been working to strengthen the all four basic safeguards concepts to prevent realisation of risk/hazard. Those four concepts are: 1. Prevent, 2. Detect, 3. Control 4. Mitigate In the early days, most of the efforts still focused on mitigation or curative action to battle common integrity’s enemies such as corrosions, erosions and mechanical failures. Recently, after few years of journey, the efforts slowly shifting from curative to preventive action along with latest rapid outgrowth of technology in the inspection/detection. Findings - Historical data record shows that by consistenly implementing AIMS Chevron succesfully reduced incident (oil spill) caused by integrity problems (corrosions, erosions and mechanical failures) from 212 events in early 2003 to be 14 events in late 2013. Implementation of AIMS have truly assisted PT. CPI to sustain world class company.

Presently, there are many nondestructive testing methods available. Magnetic methods to monitor fatigue cracks are not yet fully exploited and seem promising due {{to the possibility of}} passive monitoring using the Earth magnetic field as source.

A sign change of the out-of-plane magnetic field density can be observed in the vicinity of a crack. Therefore, the crack can be detected by modern Hall probes. This makes it possible to develop a passive crack monitoring system based on magnetism. Copyright © 2014 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE) ...|$|E
