Specific objectives guided the research. The first objective determined {{the influence of}} public procurement policies on the use <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> procurement in public hospitals in Vihiga County. The second objective found out how e-procurement affects the use <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> procurement in public hospitals in Vihiga County. The third objective established {{the effect of the}} staff skills on the use <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> procurement in public hospitals in Vihiga County. The fourth objective determined the effect of funding on the use <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> procurement in public hospitals in Vihiga County. The literature relating to the study was reviewed and a conceptual framework developed. Descriptive research design, specifically a survey study was employed i...|$|R

The development of new methods is intrinsically driven by new knowledge emanating from fundamental research in toxicology, carcinogenesis, molecular biology, biochemistry, computer sciences, {{and a host of other}} disciplines. Critical evaluations and strong scientific consensus are essential to facilitate adoption <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> for use in the safety assessment of drugs, chemicals, and other environmental factors. Recommendations to hasten the development <b>of</b> new <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> included increasing emphasis on the development of mechanism-based methods, increasing fundamental toxicological research, increasing training on the use <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods,</b> integrating accepted <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> into toxicity assessment, internationally harmonizating chemical toxicity classification schemes, and increasing international cooperation to develop, validate, and gain acceptance <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods...</b>|$|R

40|$|Before nonanimal {{toxicity}} tests may be officially {{accepted by}} regulatory agencies, {{it is generally}} agreed that {{the validity of the}} new methods must be demonstrated in an independent, scientifically sound validation program. Validation has been defined as the demonstration of the reliability and relevance of a test method for a particular purpose. This paper provides a brief review of the development of the theoretical aspects of the validation process and updates current thinking about objectively testing the performance <b>of</b> an <b>alternative</b> <b>method</b> in a validation study. Validation <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> for eye irritation testing is a specific example illustrating important concepts. Although discussion focuses on the validation <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> intended to replace current in vivo toxicity tests, the procedures can be used to assess the performance <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> intended for other uses.

50|$|Criticism of {{traditional}} mathematics instruction originates with advocates <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> instruction, such as Reform mathematics. These critics cite studies, such as The Harmful Effects of Algorithms in Grades 1-4, which found specific instances where traditional math instruction was less effective than <b>alternative</b> <b>methods.</b> Advocates <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> argue that {{traditional methods of}} instruction over-emphasize memorization and repetition, and fail to promote conceptual understanding or to present math as creative or exploratory. Critics also sometimes cite the fact that history of mathematics often focuses on European advancements and methods developed by men, thus ignoring equity issues and potentially alienating minorities and women.|$|R

The workshop was hosted by the European Centre for the Validation <b>of</b> <b>Alternative</b> <b>Methods</b> (ECVAM) and jointly organized by ECVAM, the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) and the Johns Hopkins University Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT). The primary aim of the workshop was to identify and catalogue potential methods {{that could be used to}} assess how data from in vitro <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> could help to predict and identify DNT hazards. Working groups focused on two different aspects: (1) Details on the science available in the field of DNT, including discussions on the models available to capture the critical DNT mechanisms and processes, and (2) Policy and strategy aspects to assess the integration <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> in a regulatory framework.
