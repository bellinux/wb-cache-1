5|$|In late June 2006, before Booker took office, New Jersey {{investigators}} foiled a plot {{to assassinate}} Booker led by Bloods gang leaders inside four New Jersey state prisons. The motive for the plot was unclear, but was described variously {{as a response to}} the acrimonious campaign and to Booker's campaign promises to take <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> line on crime.|$|E
5|$|The Young {{brothers}} {{decided to}} abandon the glam rock image which had already been adopted by Melbourne band The Skyhooks and pursue <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> blues-rock sound. To this end they agreed that Evans was not a suitable frontman for the group. Around this time, they also moved their base to Melbourne, where they frequently played at the Hard Rock.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{projectiles}} also changed during the ironclad period. Initially, the best armor-piercing projectile was a solid cast-iron shot. Later, shot of chilled iron, <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> iron alloy, gave better armor-piercing qualities. Eventually the armor-piercing shell was developed.|$|E

5|$|Adventure 2 has 180 emblems, earned for {{a variety}} of tasks. Each level has five missions; only the first is {{required}} to continue the campaign, and other missions include completing <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> version of a level and collecting 100 rings. The player earns emblems by completing missions and other tasks, many related to Chao raising. Collecting all the emblems unlocks a 3D version of the Green Hill Zone stage from the original Sonic the Hedgehog.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} Bactrian camel, the {{dromedary}} has a lighter build, longer limbs, shorter hairs, <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> palate and an insignificant or absent ethmoidal fissure. Unlike the camelids {{of the genus}} Lama, the dromedary has a hump, and in comparison has a longer tail, smaller ears, squarer feet and a greater height at the shoulder. The dromedary has four teats instead of the two in the Lama species.|$|E
5|$|During Copeland's training, {{he trained}} one weekday and all weekend. The school's {{practice}} ring was a 12-by-14-foot boxing ring with <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> mat {{than that of}} a typical wrestling ring. The ceiling above it was low, with exposed pipes, preventing top-rope moves from being performed. Copeland later credited this environment with forcing him to drill and improve his technical mat-based wrestling. His classmates included Johnny Swinger, Joe E. Legend, and Rob Etcheverria (who later became notable for training wrestlers such as Gail Kim, Angelina Love, and Taylor Wilde).|$|E

5|$|The band began {{composing}} {{new songs}} in 2011, {{and had the}} album's first recording sessions in early 2012 before the musicians {{decided to take a}} break. As all the band members got into side projects afterwards, work on Lightning Bolt only resumed in March 2013. The music for Lightning Bolt has <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> rock sound with longer songs to contrast predecessor Backspacer (2009), and the lyrics convey singer Eddie Vedder's feelings on aging and mortality.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} this album is mostly {{original}} and {{a combination of}} progressive rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock, but with <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> edge and with the guitar parts in more evidence than in the past. This was due both {{to the growth of}} guitarist Ritchie Blackmore as a songwriter and to the conflicts within the band over the fusion of classical music and rock proposed by keyboard player Jon Lord and amply implemented in the band's previous releases.|$|E
5|$|The player may suspend {{and save}} the game at any time. Upon {{completion}} of the game, the player may start a New Game Plus, which restarts the game with certain features carried over and unlocks <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> mode. With each successful completion of a new difficulty level, further difficulty levels will become available in which enemy health and damage is multiplied. There are ten difficulty settings in Resonance of Fate.|$|E

5|$|Free updates to {{the game}} were {{released}} to provide fixes and updates {{to the game}}, some based on community feedback. These included: a Big Head mode, which makes all characters in the game have disproportionate heads; a photo mode, which allows players to edit photos taken during gameplay; {{the ability to use}} the original voice cast, with localized subtitles; and updates to the game's AR challenges. These included the ability to select all playable characters from the game and its downloadable content (DLC) to be used in all combat and predator challenge maps. Previously, each map had predefined character selection; the addition of <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> difficulty setting on combat challenges; more round-based challenges as well as interior map locations; and the removal of the blue wall around the challenges, which players found distracting.|$|E
5|$|The IK-2 and IK-14 penal {{colonies in}} Yavas, Zubovo-Polyansky District, Mordovia, {{are the most}} common {{destinations}} for women prisoners sentenced in Moscow. It is the former location of the Dubravlag labor camp complex of the Gulag system. Tolokonnikova was incarcerated in IK-14, whereas Alyokhina was sent to IK-32 in Perm. The latter is a colony for first-time offenders, which houses a sewing factory, and an experimental vocational program to re-train women prisoners to become digital cartoon animators. Conditions in IK-32 are relatively favorable, and neither prisoners nor human rights monitors have filed complaints about its conditions. Meanwhile, IK-14 has <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> reputation.|$|E
5|$|The Indians were <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> fight; {{they were}} out of the main field of battle, skirmishing on the edge of an {{adjacent}} swamp. Richard Johnson eventually ordered a suicide squad of twenty men to ride forward and draw the Indians' fire, planning to charge with the rest as they reloaded. But the ground before the Indian position was too swampy to support many cavalry. Johnson had to order his men to dismount and hold until Shelby's infantry came up. But eventually they broke, and fled into the swamp, during which time Tecumseh was slain, some say by Johnson, others believing it was someone else.|$|E

5|$|The era {{of record}} labels {{investing}} in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited {{control over their}} content and marketing, ended with the late 1970s. Corporate artists and repertoire staff exerted an increasing amount {{of control over the}} creative process that had previously belonged to the artists, and established acts were pressured to create music with simpler harmony and song structures and fewer changes in meter. A number of symphonic pop bands, such as Supertramp, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project and the Electric Light Orchestra, brought the orchestral-style arrangements into a context that emphasised pop singles while allowing for occasional instances of exploration. Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant and Pink Floyd opted for <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> sound in the style of arena rock.|$|E
5|$|The predilection of the Welsh for roasted cheese led to {{the dish}} of Welsh rarebit, or Welsh rabbit, {{seasoned}} melted cheese poured over toasted bread. The cheese {{would need to be}} <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> one, such as chedder or similar. Referred to as Welsh rabbit as early as 1725, the name is not similar to the Welsh term caws pobi. Welsh folk rarely ate rabbit due to the cost and as land owners would not allow rabbit hunting, so the term is more likely a slur on the Welsh. The name evolved from rabbit to rarebit, possibly to remove the slur from Welsh cuisine or due to simple reinterpretation of the word to make menus more pleasant.|$|E
5|$|Under severe {{pressure}} from his ministers {{to resolve this}} issue, Field travelled to England in March 1964 to pursue sovereign statehood, but returned empty-handed a month later. He resigned his position on 13 April; this {{came as no surprise}} to many government insiders, but appeared sudden to most sections of the general public. Smith promptly accepted the cabinet's invitation to take over, though he expressed surprise at the nomination. A farmer and erstwhile British Royal Air Force pilot from the rural town of Selukwe, Smith was Southern Rhodesia's first native-born head of government. He immediately promised to take <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> line on independence than his predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Abnormally {{developed}} milk caps infested by the parasitic sac fungus Hypomyces lateritius (syn. Peckialla laterita) are occasionally {{found in}} summer and autumn. The infested fruit bodies are usually more or less heavily malformed with <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> and more solid flesh than typical fruit bodies, {{so that they are}} more resistant to rot and can even survive the winter. They do not create gills; instead, the cap bottom is covered by an initially soft, white hyphen fungus, also known as a subiculum. Early on the mycelia becomes denser and takes on a white-grey colour. The perithecia are created after about 10–14 days. Perithecia are fruit bodies of the Hypomyces and other sac fungi, in which the spindle-shaped asci are produced. Besides L.deterrimus, L.deliciosus and L.sanguifluus can become infested, rarely other milk caps. Hypomyces lateritius, H.ochraceus, H.rosellus, H.odoratus, among other Hypomyces species live parasitically on different milk caps and brittlegills {{as well as on the}} fruit bodies of species from other genera.|$|E
5|$|Dwight D. Eisenhower {{was elected}} U.S. President in 1952, {{promising}} to take <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> line against communism; the links that his staff members John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles had to the UFC also predisposed {{them to act}} against the Guatemalan government. Additionally, the U.S. government drew exaggerated conclusions {{about the extent of}} communist influence from the presence of a small number of communists among Árbenz's advisers. Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. The coup was preceded by U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare. This included a radio station which broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news, as well as bombings of Guatemala City and a naval blockade of Guatemala. The invasion force fared poorly militarily, and most of its offensives were defeated. However, psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which eventually refused to fight. Árbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on 27 June. Castillo Armas became president ten days later, following negotiations in San Salvador.|$|E
5|$|Verbinski did {{not want}} an entirely romanticized feel to the film: he wanted a sense of {{historical}} fantasy. Most of the actors wore prosthetics and contact lenses. Depp had contacts that acted as sunglasses, while Rush and Lee Arenberg wore dulled contacts that gave a sinister feel to the characters. Mackenzie Crook wore two contacts to represent his character's wooden eye: a soft version, and <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> version for when it protrudes. In addition, their rotten teeth and scurvy skin were dyed on, although Depp did have gold teeth added, which he forgot to remove after filming. Depp also used a genuine pistol which was made in 1760 in London, which the crew bought from a dealer in Connecticut. A number of swords were built for the production by blacksmith Tony Swatton. The crew spent five months creating the cavern in which Barbossa and the Black Pearl crew attempt to reverse their curse, filling it with five feet of water, 882 Aztec coins, and some gold paint on the styrofoam rocks for more impressions of treasure. The crew also built the fortress at Port Royal in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, and Governor Swann's palace was built at Manhattan Beach. A fire broke out in September 2002, causing $525,000 worth of damage, though no one was injured.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>hard</b> {{disk drive}} platter (or disk) is the {{circular}} disk on which magnetic data {{is stored in}} <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> disk drive. The rigid nature of the platters in <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> drive is what gives them their name (as opposed to the flexible materials which are used to make floppy disks). Hard drives typically have several platters which are mounted on the same spindle. A platter can store information on both sides, requiring two heads per platter.|$|R
