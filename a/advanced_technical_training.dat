40|$|Scorpion stings are {{the main}} cause of human {{envenomation}} in Brazil and, for the treatment of victims, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antivenoms. The first step to achieve effective antivenom is to use a good quality venom pool and to evaluate it, with LD 50 determination as the most accepted procedure. It is, however, time-consuming and requires <b>advanced</b> <b>technical</b> <b>training.</b> Further, there are significant ethical concerns regarding the number of animals required for testing. Hence, we investigated the correspondence between LD 50 results, in vitro assays, and a strong correlation with proteolytic activity levels was observed, showing, remarkably, that proteases are potential toxicity markers for Tityus serrulatus venom. The comparison of reversed-phase chromatographic profiles also has a potential application in venoms’ quality control, as there were fewer neurotoxins detected in the venom with high LD 50 value. These results were confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. Therefore, these methods could precede the LD 50 assay to evaluate the venom excellence by discriminating—and discarding—poor-quality batches, and, consequently, with a positive impact on the number of animals used. Notably, proposed assays are fast and inexpensive, being technically and economically feasible in Tityus serrulatus venom quality control to produce effective antivenoms...|$|E
