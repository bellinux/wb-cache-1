To understand the regulation of POU 1 F 1 gene in Ovis aries we report its cloning, sequencing and characterization. The sequenced 5787 bp included six exons and two complete introns. Ovine POU 1 F 1 gene has a high level of conservation with its bovine, human and rat counterparts showing 98. 2 %, 91. 2 % and 86. 2 % of similarity at the coding level, respectively. All six exons were analyzed for polymorphism detection in 100 animals of the Portuguese indigenous ovine breed ‘Churra da Terra Quente’.

Slight variations in <b>allelic</b> <b>frequencies</b> may have large impacts on the crop's quality and can occur {{in a variety of ways}} including through cross-contamination of pollen and/or seeds and in seed regeneration.

This insures that the allele frequencies haven't changed much between the two generations and ensures the purity of the line based on the set SNPs for the maize. For maize there have been between 50-100 SNPs identified that can be used to conduct this type of analysis.|$|E
5000|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a common}} heart disease in all cats and is most commonly genetic in cause. The disease causes thickening of the heart wall, which makes the heart pump less efficiently. It can, in some instances, lead to sudden death. In Ragdolls homozygous positive for the disease (having two copies of the HCM gene), the condition can present early (as young as six months) and tends to be severe, with most cats dying by age 3. Heterozygous (one copy of HCM gene) cats tend to have later onset and slower progression of the disease with less severe impact. A DNA test was developed in 2007 to identify the gene that causes HCM in Ragdolls.

5000|$|The {{stepwise}} mutation model (SMM) is {{a mathematical}} theory, developed by Motoo Kimura and Tomoko Ohta, {{that allows for}} investigation of the equilibrium distribution of <b>allelic</b> <b>frequencies</b> in a finite population where neutral alleles are produced in step-wise fashion. The original model assumes that if an allele has a mutation that causes it to change in state, mutations that occur in repetitive regions of the genome will increase or decrease by a single repeat unit at a fixed rate (i.e. by the addition or subtraction of one repeat unit per generation) and these changes in allele states are expressed by an integer ([...] [...] A-1, A, A1, [...][...]). The model also assumes random mating and that all alleles are selectively equivalent for each locus. The SMM is distinguished from the Kimura-Crow model, {{also known as the}} infinite alleles model (IAM), in that as the population size increases to infinity, while the product of the Ne (effective population size) and the mutation rate is fixed, the mean number of different alleles in the population rapidly reaches a peak and plateaus, at which time that value is almost the same as the effective number of alleles.|$|E

We {{have developed a}} genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach for estimating <b>allelic</b> <b>frequencies</b> on pooled samples (Pool-GBS) {{and used it to}} examine segregation distortion in doubled haploid (DH) populations of barley (L.). In the first phase, we genotyped each line individually and exploited these data to explore a strategy to call single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on pooled reads. We measured both the number of SNPs called and the variance of the estimated <b>allelic</b> <b>frequencies</b> at various depths of coverage on a subset of reads containing 5 to 25 million reads. We show that <b>allelic</b> <b>frequencies</b> could be cost-effectively and accurately estimated at a depth of 50 reads per SNP using 15 million reads. This Pool-GBS approach yielded 1984 SNPs whose allelic frequency estimates were highly reproducible (CV = 10. 4 %) and correlated (= 0. 9167) with the “true” frequency derived from analysis of individual lines. In a second phase, we used Pool-GBS to investigate segregation bias throughout androgenesis from microspores to a population of regenerated plants. No strong bias was detected among the microspores resulting from the meiotic divisions, whereas significant biases could be shown to arise during embryo formation and plant regeneration. In summary, this methodology provides an approach to estimate <b>allelic</b> <b>frequencies</b> more efficiently and on materials that are unsuitable for individual analysis.

However, the efficacy of the CTL response varies between individuals. We tested the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms in the lytic effector molecule perforin could influence the progression of HIV infection. The perforin gene was screened for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC). Correlations were sought between perforin genotype, perforin expression and lytic function of CD 8 + T lymphocytes from HIV-positive patients. Association of perforin genotype with disease progression was investigated in 426 seroconverters enrolled in the French SEROCO cohort. AIDS-free survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Three SNPs were found in the proximal promoter region of the perforin gene: 63 G (<b>allelic</b> <b>frequency</b> 0. 029), 112 G (<b>allelic</b> <b>frequency</b> 0. 071) and 1012 T (<b>allelic</b> <b>frequency</b> 0. 070). The presence of the 1012 T genotype correlated with fewer perforin+ cells among circulating CD 8 + CTL. However, CTL lines from HIV(-positive) individuals heterozygous for the perforin 1012 T SNP displayed normal lysis of target cells, and within the SEROCO cohort, patients heterozygous for the 1012 T SNP showed normal disease progression. However, 1012 T/T homozygotes showed a tendency towards slower disease progression (P = 0. 08). In conclusion, polymorphism in the perforin gene is limited, and although the 1012 T genotype appears to influence perforin expression, it was not conclusively associated with disease progression in HIV infection...|$|R
