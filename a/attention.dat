40|$|In {{this article}} I trace {{mediated}} effects that surface with <b>attentions</b> to seniors {{and their bodies}} in care. This includes new technologies for visualizing and monitoring the body. I also consider the implications of mediated body-technology <b>attentions</b> for care surveillance. Surveillance offers valuable analytical purchase {{in the study of}} care. Yet, care <b>attentions</b> are not always straightforward. These can become obstructed, negotiated and transformed with technologies for care. There are multiple empirical examples of how technically mediated <b>attentions</b> produce ambiguous or multivalent effects, both in the literature and my own ethnographic work. These multivalent effects, I argue, displace the notion of surveillance in care. To strengthen my argument, I draw on STS-inspired anthropological studies of care. Lastly I proffer the term “care-valence” as a heuristic compliment to the notion of care surveillance. This term, I proffer, benefits the analysis of how care <b>attentions</b> effect somatechnic relations...|$|R

5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{problems}} with joint <b>attention</b> are associated with developmental processes. Difficulties in establishing joint <b>attention</b> may partially account for differences in social abilities of children with developmental disorders (i.e. Autism spectrum disorders). A core deficit noted in autism is eye gaze. Autistic children have difficulty alternating their <b>attention</b> towards a partner and third object. This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint <b>attention.</b> Deaf infants are able to engage in joint <b>attention</b> similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged in joint <b>attention</b> is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents. Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their deaf infants' initiative and communicative acts. Deaf infants of deaf parents do not show reduced time spent in joint <b>attention.</b> Auditory input is not critical to joint <b>attention</b> but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital. Furthermore, mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint <b>attention</b> with their child rate that infant lower on scales of social competence. Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age. In blind infants, joint <b>attention</b> is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} two important skills in joint <b>attention</b> are following eye gaze and identifying intention. The ability to share gaze with another individual {{is an important}} skill in establishing reference. The ability to identify intention is important in a child's ability to learn language and direct the <b>attention</b> of others. Joint <b>attention</b> is important for many aspects of language development including comprehension, production and word learning. Episodes of joint <b>attention</b> provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development {{and the ability to}} take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint <b>attention</b> abilities. The ability to establish joint <b>attention</b> may be negatively affected by deafness, blindness, and developmental disorders such as autism.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} intention is critical to joint <b>attention.</b> When individuals understand that others have goals, intentions, and attentional states, {{they are able to}} enter into and direct another's <b>attention.</b> Joint <b>attention</b> promotes and maintains dyadic exchanges and learning about the nature of social partners. The ability to engage in joint <b>attention</b> is crucial for language development.|$|E

5|$|Triadic joint <b>attention</b> is {{the highest}} level of joint <b>attention</b> and {{involves}} two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared <b>attention.</b> For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint <b>attention</b> it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their <b>attention</b> on each other. Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual. Triadic <b>attention</b> is marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.|$|E

Dyadic joint <b>attention</b> involves mutual gaze between the parent and infant. Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant looking at each other's face. If two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.|$|E

5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint <b>attention</b> when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's <b>attention.</b> This increased level of joint <b>attention</b> aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint <b>attention</b> is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E

5|$|As {{described}} in attachment theory, infants {{need to develop}} a relationship with a primary caregiver to achieve normal social and emotional development. A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be joint <b>attention.</b> In addition to language development, joint <b>attention</b> serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint <b>attention</b> predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level form of joint <b>attention</b> involving smiling at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in infants. Early joint <b>attention</b> abilities account for differences in social and emotional abilities in later life.|$|E
5|$|At {{one year}} of age, joint <b>attention</b> is {{displayed}} through a child's understanding of pointing as an intentional act. One-year-olds also establish joint <b>attention</b> for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see. At age 15 months, children recognize the minds of others. At this age, children also {{recognize the importance of}} eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight. At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint <b>attention.</b> 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the mentalistic experience of seeing and the role of eyes and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision. At two years of age, children display joint <b>attention</b> by extending <b>attention</b> beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's <b>attention</b> extends to the past as well. Two-year-olds are also capable of representational thought or increased memory.|$|E

5|$|<b>Attention</b> deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It is characterized by problems paying <b>attention,</b> excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age.

In children, problems paying <b>attention</b> may result in poor school performance. Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many children with ADHD have a good <b>attention</b> span for tasks they find interesting.|$|E
