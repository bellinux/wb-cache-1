5|$|<b>Anchored</b> <b>in</b> Manila Bay, Cooke {{pretended that}} his ships were French vessels and {{successfully}} lured successive boatloads of Spanish officials aboard, taking them prisoner in turn. Once he had determined from his captives {{the state of}} defences in Manila, that the treasure ship had been unloaded at Cavite and that the Spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations, he sent a raiding party against a squadron of gunboats {{in the mouth of}} the Pasig River. Capturing the gunboats in a bloodless attack, Cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards, unsuccessfully assaulting Zamboanga before returning to Macau.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of an {{adaptive immune system}} whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.|$|E
5|$|As Ewiniar {{started to}} {{approach}} the Ryūkyū Islands, Sasebo Naval Base in Kyūshū announced a Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness 3 at 4 p.m. local time on July 7, while a day earlier, on July 6, the USS Harpers Ferry had unanchored from the harbour for an area of safer weather conditions. The USS Essex also evacuated the area on July 7. The USS Juneau and USS Bowditch, however, both remained <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> Sasebo, while the USS Guardian and USS Safeguard were both moved to a nearby dry dock.|$|E

30|$|Zhang et al. (2001) {{summarized}} {{the results of}} a comprehensive study of <b>anchors</b> <b>in</b> cracked and uncracked concrete led by Dr. Klingner at the University of Taxes, Austin in 1990 s. The tests focused on expansion anchors and undercut anchors that are of interest by nuclear industries. Groups of four anchors were subjected to cyclic moments at a rate similar to that in an earthquake. The tests indicated that the cracks up to 0.25  mm [0.01 in.] did not affect the capacity of tested undercut anchors but caused larger displacements at failure. Meanwhile, the expansion <b>anchors</b> <b>in</b> cracks developed low capacity and in some cases the failure modes changed from concrete breakout (for <b>anchors</b> <b>in</b> uncracked concrete) to pull-out (for <b>anchors</b> <b>in</b> cracked concrete).|$|R
5|$|As of 14:00 on 23 July 2013, {{the ship}} was <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> Oysterhaven Anchorage in County Cork. The 30 crew members of the ship {{consisted}} of the master; three permanent crew members; a cook on a temporary contract; a mentor; and 24 trainees aged from 15-24 (eight from Ireland, four from the Netherlands, three from the United Kingdom, six from France, two from Belgium and one from Spain). This meant that there were 23 teenagers and 7 adults on board, consisting of 24 trainees and 6 permanent crew. Pieter de Kam was captaining the ship.|$|E
5|$|Completion of {{the ship}} was {{originally}} scheduled for March 1945, but it was rescheduled for August because of delays. Work continued until 16 March 1945, but it was ordered to halt when she was 80% complete {{to concentrate on the}} construction of small submarines needed to defend Japan against an American invasion. She was <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> Ebisu Bay, near Sasebo, and surrendered there on 2 September {{along with the rest of}} the Japanese military. Ibuki was scrapped in Sasebo Naval Arsenal Drydock No. 7, 22 November 1946 – 1 August 1947.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1860s whaling {{declined}} rapidly {{with the increasing}} use of petroleum, the onset of the Californian goldrush, and the American Civil War – with unfortunate consequences for the island. To explore alternative means of income Thompson, in 1867, purchased the Sylph which was the first local vessel to trade with Sydney (mainly pigs and onions). It <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> deep water at what is now Sylph's Hole off Old Settlement Beach, but was eventually tragically lost at sea in 1873 which added to the woes of the island at this time.|$|E

For the last nine years of its service life, Minas Geraes remained largely inactive, and was towed to Italy for scrapping in March 1954.|$|E
5|$|New England whaling ships hunting {{sperm whales}} in the Pacific began {{to arrive in}} Hawaii in 1819, and many ships <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> Honolulu and Lahaina. The impact of the whaling fleets on the Hawaiian Islands {{during the reign of}} Kamehameha III (1825–1854) shaped the entire Hawaiian economy and was the primary source of income for the islands until the {{discovery}} of oil in Titusville, Pennsylvania, in 1859 and the onset of the American Civil War (1861–1865).|$|E
5|$|On 25 January the gale {{was still}} blowing; the fleet {{tried to leave}} Botany Bay, but only HMS Supply made it out, {{carrying}} Arthur Phillip, Philip Gidley King, some marines and about 40 convicts; they <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> Sydney Cove in the afternoon. On 26 January, early in the morning, Phillip {{along with a few}} dozen marines, officers and oarsmen, rowed ashore and took possession of the land in the name of King George III.

A shipboard inspection during this time found her hull was rotten with shipworm and on 23 May 1788 she was careened on the beach for repairs. In July she was released from government service and set sail for England on the 14th of that month, in convoy with her First Fleet sister ships Alexander, Borrowdale and Friendship, and under the overall command of Lieutenant John Shortland in Alexander.|$|E
5|$|The deck of {{the bridge}} was formed by pre-casting {{individual}} concrete units on the southern river shore, then hoisting them into place on temporary timber staging in the river. The units were then structurally joined by strands of high-tensile wire and stretched with a hydraulic jack. These pre-stressing strands were <b>anchored</b> <b>in</b> reinforced concrete blocks {{at the ends of}} the spans. The new bridge had a traffic capacity of 6,000 cars per hour in each direction, over a total of six traffic lanes.|$|E
5|$|This {{experimental}} {{freedom was}} fully exercised on the Daddies' second album, Rapid City Muscle Car. Self-produced and self-recorded, Rapid City Muscle Car was the band's attempt at creating an eclectic concept album wherein each track was composed {{in a different}} musical style, yet were all thematically united through interconnected lyricism. <b>Anchored</b> <b>in</b> funk and swing, the album featured genre experiments in ska punk, psychedelic rock, country, rockabilly, big band, hard rock and lounge. Released on the band's self-operated label Space Age Bachelor Pad Records in December 1994, the album sold decently, though failed to match the success of Ferociously Stoned.|$|E
